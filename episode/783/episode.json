In epistemology he’s interested in what we should think (the belief-credence connection), why we should think it (foundations), and how we should think about what we should think (higher-order uncertainty).  In logic, he’s interested in various models of these things; in language, he’s interested the semantics of various statements about them. More recently, he’s been thinking about the connection between epistemology and cognitive science and psychology—and, in particular, how our idealized models and theories of rationality can help inform our understanding of our non-ideal selves.",

He works on epistemology, logic, language, and their intersections.  In epistemology he’s interested in what we should think (the belief-credence connection), why we should think it (foundations), and how we should think about what we should think (higher-order uncertainty).  In logic, he’s interested in various models of these things; in language, he’s interested the semantics of various statements about them. More recently, he’s been thinking about the connection between epistemology and cognitive science and psychology—and, in particular, how our idealized models and theories of rationality can help inform our understanding of our non-ideal selves.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about epistemology. We go through topics like: the questions epistemology deals with; what a belief is; the distinction between beliefs, assertions, and guesses; justified beliefs; higher-order evidence, and higher-order uncertainty; epistemic modesty; and when to defer to experts.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:25</time> What is epistemology?  \n<time>04:33</time> What is a belief?  \n<time>08:14</time> Beliefs, assertions, and guesses  \n<time>11:41</time> Justified beliefs  \n<time>19:28</time> Higher-order evidence, and higher-order uncertainty  \n<time>23:15</time> Epistemic modesty  \n<time>36:06</time> Deferring to the experts  \n<time>43:38</time> Follow Dr. Dorst’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Dorst’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3Scz3YW  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3P7LvHG  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3AMiFbt\n",
