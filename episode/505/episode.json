Dr. Montague is the editor of Non-Propositional Intentionality, Cognitive Phenomenology, and Philosophical Writings by P.F. Strawson (co-edited with Galen Strawson). She is the author of The Given: experience and its content.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, with a focus on The Given. We go through several different concepts, like mental content, intentionality, and phenomenology. We discuss cognition, perception and sensory experience, and the relationship between them. We talk about the nature of consciousness. And we discuss the relationship between mind and metaphysics, the metaphysics of mental phenomena, the access we have to reality, and the metaphysical nature of reality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:28</time> Mental content, intentionality, and phenomenology  \n<time>07:08</time> What is “the given”?  \n<time>08:27</time> Consciousness  \n<time>11:29</time> Cognition, perception, and the senses  \n<time>14:44</time> Access to reality  \n<time>16:06</time> Evaluative phenomenology  \n<time>19:10</time> Epistemology  \n<time>20:20</time> Metaphysics, and the nature of reality  \n<time>28:29</time> Panpsychism  \n<time>30:55</time> Follow Dr. Montague’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Montague’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3cmHHlm  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/32VKRqj  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/2YmxIEu  \nThe Given: https://amzn.to/3sXYxfe\n",
