He conducts his research under the auspices of the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) and the University of Amsterdam's Brain and Cognition (ABC) Center.

We start with its cognitive components, and then go through: musicality in other animals; the relationship between musicality and language; the evolutionary functions of music; synchrony and social bonding; human universals in music; the neuroscience of music; sexual selection; and if other animals appreciate music.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:49</time> What is musicality?  \n<time>03:25</time> The cognitive components of musicality  \n<time>08:58</time> Musicality in other animals  \n<time>17:17</time> Is there a relationship between musicality and language?  \n<time>21:45</time> The evolutionary functions of music  \n<time>27:54</time> Synchrony and social bonding  \n<time>30:54</time> Human universals in music  \n<time>35:34</time> Is how people estimate time related to musicality?  \n<time>41:53</time> Is music localized in the brain?  \n<time>47:06</time> Was music sexually selected?  \n<time>51:18</time> Do other animals appreciate music?  \n<time>56:34</time> Follow Dr. Honing’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Honing’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3rmm6j7  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3ymKT7R  \nMusic Cognition Group: https://bit.ly/3AH6N8U\n",
