  \nIn this episode, we talk about some of the main cognitive biases and heuristics\
  \ (mental short-cuts) that affect decision-making, and particularly when applied\
  \ to experts and professionals. Topics include: how everyone falls for biases; the\
  \ bias blind spot; the hindsight bias; the outcome bias; being overconfident; situations\
  \ where nonexperts perform better than experts; the familiarity effect; the availability\
  \ heuristic; the sunk cost fallacy; and how to help people and experts make better\
  \ decisions.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:59</time> Experts also fall for biases and\
