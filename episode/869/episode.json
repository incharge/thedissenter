shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 1st 2023.  \nDr. Alexandra Plakias is Associate Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Hamilton College. Her research focuses on issues in moral psychology,\
  \ such as the role of evolution and culture in our moral values. She has also written\
  \ about moral relativism and about the role of empirical research in philosophical\
  \ theorizing. She is the author of Thinking Through Food: A Philosophical Introduction.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Thinking Through Food. We start by discussing the\
  \ metaphysics of food, what is food, whether something that is culturally normative\
  \ is real, and whether properties like taste are objective. We then get into epistemology,\
  \ and talk about how we acquire knowledge about food, and whether we should trust\
  \ food advertising and labels, including things like \u201Corganic\u201D, \u201C\
  natural\u201D, \u201CGMO\u201D, etc. We talk about aesthetic, and whether food can\
  \ be art. We discuss whether there should be property rights for the creators of\
  \ recipes, and issues regarding cultural appropriation. We talk about the ethics\
  \ of food, and how food production is ethically related to health. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the future of food, with a focus on cultured meat.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
