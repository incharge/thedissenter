shownotes: "Dr. Justin L. Barrett is founder and president of Blueprint 1543 and adjunct\
  \ professor of psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary, where he was formerly\
  \ director of the Thrive Center and chief project developer for Science, Theology,\
  \ and Religion Initiatives. His new book is Thriving with Stone Age Minds: Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology, Christian Faith, and the Quest for Human Flourishing.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Thriving with Stone Age Minds. We start by defining \u201Cthriving\u201D\
  , and what it means from both an evolutionary psychological and a Christian theological\
  \ perspective. We discuss why the book is focused on Christianity and not any other\
  \ religion. We talk about the concept of \u201Chuman nature\u201D. We talk about\
  \ the concepts/phenomena of niche construction, evolutionary mismatch, and the nature-niche\
  \ gap. We discuss the interplay between evolutionary psychology and Christian theology\
  \ in human flourishing. We talk about the traits of self-control, hypersociality,\
  \ and expertise acquisition. We then talk about cases of evolutionary mismatch in\
  \ modern industrialized societies, like the education system, professional occupations,\
  \ and self-control. We also discuss the religious concept of \u201Ctelos\u201D.\
  \ Finally, we discuss potential conflicts that might arise between a scientific\
  \ and a Christian understanding of the world, particularly when it comes to a purposeless\
  \ evolution by natural selection fit into a purposeful Universe created by God,\
  \ and also if it is possible for humans to thrive without religion.\n\nTime Links:\
