	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON APRIL 16th 2024.  \nDr. Shaun Gallagher is the Lillian and Morrie Moss Professor of Excellence at the University of Memphis. His areas of research include phenomenology and the cognitive sciences, especially topics related to embodiment, self, agency and intersubjectivity, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of time.

He is the author of several books, the most recent one being The Self and its Disorders.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Self and its Disorders. We first discuss issues with how psychiatry approaches the mind, and an approach based on 4E cognition. We talk about the notions of \u201csymptom\u201d and \u201cmental disorder\u201d. We discuss the self and the self-pattern, the relationship between self-narratives and pathology, and experiences like agency, ownership, and autonomy. We talk about therapeutic approaches that target the brain, approaches based on AI, and mindfulness. Finally, we discuss torture, solitary confinement, trauma, and cruelty.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The premise of the book  \n<time>05:27</time> 4E cognition  \n<time>10:20</time> The notions of \u201csymptom\u201d and \u201cmental disorder\u201d  \n<time>23:11</time> The self and the self-pattern  \n<time>33:52</time> Self-narratives and pathology  \n<time>39:57</time> Agency and ownership  \n<time>43:13</time> Autonomy  \n<time>46:02</time> Therapeutic approaches that target the brain  \n<time>48:47</time> Approaches based on AI  \n<time>52:05</time> Mindfulness  \n<time>58:10</time> Torture, solitary confinement, trauma, and cruelty  \n<time>1:05:26</time> Follow Dr. Gallagher\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Gallagher\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/47FcLG2  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3S0AWc8  \nThe Self and its Disorders: https://bit.ly/3vAvqFG\n",
