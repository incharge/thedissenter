He’s the author of several books, the most recent one being Honesty: The Philosophy and Psychology of a Neglected Virtue.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the virtues of generosity and patience. We start with generosity, and discuss the distinction between generous actions, acting from generosity, and being a generous person. We also discuss if generous actions need to be costly, why motivation matters, if the action needs to be freely done, what makes someone a generous person, and how generous we tend to be. We then get into patience, and talk about the importance of goals, time, emotions, and motivation in patience. We also address general questions about the virtues, including what they are really about – character, or the good they bring to other people -; the difference between continence and virtue; and moral and epistemic/intellectual virtues.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Generosity  \n<time>04:27</time> Generous actions, acting from generosity, and being a generous person  \n<time>09:11</time> Do generous actions need to be costly?  \n<time>13:57</time> Why motivation matters  \n<time>20:31</time> What if it is about something the recipient does not need?  \n<time>24:29</time> Does the action need to be freely done?  \n<time>28:56</time> What makes someone a generous person?  \n<time>36:32</time> How generous are people?  \n<time>41:18</time> The virtue of patience  \n<time>43:32</time> Goals, time, emotions, and motivation in patience  \n<time>53:27</time> Epistemic patience  \n<time>56:46</time> Are virtues about character, or about the good they bring to other people?  \n<time>1:00:10</time> The difference between continence and virtue  \n<time>1:08:47</time> Moral and epistemic/intellectual virtues  \n<time>1:13:36</time> Follow Dr. Miller’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Miller’s work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/k_Cr4J7fAbY  \nOur second interview: https://youtu.be/O747TD4Wx_0  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3vfpqyY  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3zAQoE8  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3PYPSVt  \nTwitter handle: @CharacterGap\n",
