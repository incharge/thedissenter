excerpt: 'Dr. Leo Tiokhin is Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at
  the University of Amsterdam, an Interdisciplinary Research Specialist at Strategic
  Alliance: TU/e, WUR, UU & UMC Utrecht, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven
  University of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin is a meta-scientist who studies the forces
  that shape how scientists do their work and make inferences from the populations
  that they study. Much of his research focuses on how incentive structures affect
  scientific efficiency and reliability, and how we can improve the recognition and
  reward structures in science. '

shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 1st 2022.  \nDr. Leo Tiokhin is Research Fellow at\
  \ the Institute for Advanced Study at the University of Amsterdam, an Interdisciplinary\
  \ Research Specialist at Strategic Alliance: TU/e, WUR, UU & UMC Utrecht, and a\
  \ postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin\
  \ is a meta-scientist who studies the forces that shape how scientists do their\
  \ work and make inferences from the populations that they study. Much of his research\
  \ focuses on how incentive structures affect scientific efficiency and reliability,\
  \ and how we can improve the recognition and reward structures in science. \n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about the institution of science and the production of\
  \ scientific knowledge, with a focus on the social sciences. We start by talking\
  \ about the study of science as a social phenomenon, incentives structures in science,\
  \ scientific efficiency and scientific reliability, deception and honesty in academic\
  \ publishing, and replications. We get specifically into the social sciences, and\
  \ discuss evolutionary approaches, problems with cross-cultural research, and testing\
  \ hypotheses. Finally, we talk about scientific models and how they relate to reality,\
  \ and if potential reforms to science should apply to it generally or to specific\
  \ fields.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:59</time> Studying\
