shownotes: "Dr. Cory Clark is an Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at Durham\
  \ University, UK. Dr. Clark does research in Moral Psychology, Political Psychology,\
  \ Experimental Philosophy, and Motivated Cognition.   \nDr. Bo Winegard is Assistant\
  \ Professor of Psychology at Marietta College. He generally approaches psychological\
  \ puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory of natural\
  \ selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences, individual\
  \ differences, bias, methods, and political psychology.   \nThey are both cohosts\
  \ of the Psyphilopod podcast.\n\nIn this episode, we go over some broad topics in\
  \ the history of Psychology, and its approaches and theoretical foundations. We\
  \ start off by asking if Freud really made any significant contributions to the\
  \ field. Then, we get into how folk psychology intuitions might get in the way of\
  \ proper research. We discuss the replication crisis, and what it really means.\
  \ We get into a discussion surrounding mind-brain dualism, and also to what extent\
  \ conscious processes have any causal powers in people\u2019s psychology and behavior.\
  \ We also talk about the example of cognitive dissonance and how it has been misinterpreted\
  \ as a phenomenon by social psychologists. Toward the end, we also have time to\
  \ put some controversial evolutionary psychology hypotheses on the table.\n\nTime\
