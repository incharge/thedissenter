Her research areas are in individual differences, personality, academic performance, and study choices. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about how personality traits and individual differences influence educational, occupational and life choices. First, we discuss current personality inventories, particularly the Big Five, and their scientific basis and validity. Then, we get into issues related to the gender equality paradox, and how the differences between men and women in personality and educational and career choices exacerbate in countries that are more gender equal. We talk about findings in personality differences across academic majors, and also about the personality traits that are the most stable across lifespan, but also the ones that change a bit.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:47</time> The Big Five, and other personality inventories  \n<time>07:08</time> The innate and developmental aspects of personality                                                 \n<time>13:23</time> Individual differences, and educational and occupational choices                                                \n<time>17:05</time> The gender equality paradox, and its social and political implications                                                  \n<time>26:20</time> Personality differences across academic majors                                               \n<time>45:20</time> Personality changes across lifespan, and traits that predict well-being and successful ageing                                                \n<time>54:39</time> Are old people really less open to experience?                         \n<time>1:05:13</time> Follow Dr. Vedel’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Vedel’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2JaboHR  \nResearchgate page: https://bit.ly/2XycmCj\n\nRelevant articles:  \nBig Five personality group differences across academic majors: A systematic review: https://bit.ly/2VJcTmQ  \nPersonality and Academic Performance: https://bit.ly/2FrqLKT  \nPersonality, academic majors and performance: Revealing complex patterns: https://bit.ly/2ZTyRTo  \nThe Big Five and tertiary academic performance: A systematic review and meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/2LgZHSn\n",
