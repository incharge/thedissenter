  \ of Mathematics at Birkbeck, University of London. Educated at Oxford and Manchester,\
  \ Dr. Hart is also the thirty-third Gresham Professor of Geometry, the first woman\
  \ to hold the position since its inception in 1597. She is the author of Once Upon\
  \ a Prime: The Wondrous Connections Between Mathematics and Literature.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Once Upon a Prime. We talk about the connection between mathematics\
  \ and literature in several different dimensions, including the structure of literary\
  \ texts; poetry, and rhyme schemes; plots and narrative choices in novels; numbers\
  \ used in fiction; turns of phrase, metaphors, and allusions; mathematical themes,\
  \ and stereotypes of mathematicians; and the idea of mathematics itself. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the messages of the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
