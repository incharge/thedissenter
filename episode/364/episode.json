Her research focuses on the cultural evolution of languages in different social environments. Specifically, she studies how the social structure of the environment affects the grammatical structure of languages.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about many questions that Psycholinguistics tries to answer. We ask what why child development is so important for linguistics, and if language is innate, including the poverty of the stimulus argument. We also question if it is really so difficult for adults to acquire a second language. We then discuss the cultural evolution of language, and how we can compare humans to other species. We talk about sign language and creole language. And, finally, we talk about Dr. Raviv’s work on how the social structure of the environment affects the grammatical structure of languages, and the limitations of lab studies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:34</time> What is Psycholinguistics?  \n<time>03:21</time> Child development  \n<time>06:09</time> Is language innate?  \n<time>12:02</time> Is the stimulus really poor?  \n<time>18:43</time> Differences between literate and preliterate children  \n<time>23:00</time> Is it difficult for adults to acquire a second language?  \n<time>33:43</time> The (cultural) evolution of language  \n<time>37:32</time> Comparing humans to other animals  \n<time>40:42</time> What can we learn from studying sign language?  \n<time>45:08</time> What about creole languages?  \n<time>48:13</time> What is a language?  \n<time>59:08</time> How the social structure of the environment affects the grammatical structure of languages  \n<time>1:08:38</time> Can we extrapolate from the lab to natural environments?  \n<time>1:18:05</time> Follow Dr. Raviv’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Raviv’s work:  \nMax Planck page: https://bit.ly/2WUCsla  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2JrGTfk  \nTwitter handle: @Limor_Raviv\n",
