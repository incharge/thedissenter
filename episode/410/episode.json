His research interests center on the intellectual and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is the author of several books on ancient history, the most recent one being Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny. He also has a new book coming out in 2021, The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Mortal Republic. We go through the several different political organizations that Rome had – the kingdom, the republic, and the empire -, and some of their major players, like the patricians, the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius and Gaius), and Julius Caesar. We then ask if there are any lessons we can take from the Roman Republic for modern politics, Great-Man vs. Great-Ideas theories of History, and if History really does repeat itself.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:05</time> The Roman kingdom, and the patricians  \n<time>14:56</time> The Roman republic, the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius and Gaius), and Julius Caesar  \n<time>57:02</time> Was there ever democracy in Rome?  \n<time>1:00:33</time> The Roman empire  \n<time>1:04:04</time> Lessons for modern politics  \n<time>1:07:21</time> Great-Man vs. Great-Ideas theories of History  \n<time>1:19:31</time> Does History repeat itself?  \n<time>1:22:14</time> Teaser for Dr. Watts’ upcoming book  \n<time>1:26:21</time> Follow Dr. Watts’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Watts’ work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2SPNmW5  \nAcademia.edu page: https://bit.ly/3iWFxsd  \nMortal Republic: https://amzn.to/3lC5rDw\n",
