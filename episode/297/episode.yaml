shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 9th, 2019.  \nDr. Richard Ronay is Associate Professor\
  \ of Leadership and Management at University of Amsterdam Business School. His research\
  \ interests include power and status; social hierarchy; leadership; inequality;\
  \ overconfidence; social intelligence; decision making; evolutionary psychology;\
  \ and social neuroendocrinology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on human social hierarchies\
  \ and leadership. We first talk about social hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ the different kinds of hierarchies that we can establish, and sex differences\
  \ in competition. Then we discuss leadership, the traits that tend to go along with\
  \ it, and the role that traits like overconfidence and risk-taking might play. We\
  \ also refer to the relationship between hierarchy and group effectiveness, and\
  \ the relationship between reversal learning (the ability to detect changing contingencies)\
  \ and social success. Finally, we talk about risk-taking as a sexual display strategy.\n\
