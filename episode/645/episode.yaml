shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 6th 2022.  \nDr. Steven Churchill is a Professor and\
  \ past Chair of the Department of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University.\
  \  He is also an Honorary Reader in the Evolutionary Studies Institute and Centre\
  \ for Excellence in PalaeoSciences at the University of the Witwatersrand. He is\
  \ a paleontologist who studies the fossil record of human evolution, especially\
  \ that of early members of our genus (Homo) that lived between about two million\
  \ to ten thousand years ago.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about aspects of human\
  \ evolution. We start by asking where it starts. We talk about anatomical features\
  \ anthropologists use to classify fossils, the classification of species, and determining\
  \ the sex of a specimen. We get deep into Homo naledi and Australopithecus sediba,\
  \ two new species discovered by Dr. Churchill and his collaborators. We go through\
  \ the timeline of our evolution since H. erectus. We discuss the oldest hominin\
  \ species, and how to compare hominins behaviorally with other apes, primates and\
  \ other animal groups. We talk about behavioral modernity, and the role of self-domestication\
  \ in our evolution. Finally, we discuss how speculative is the history of human\
  \ evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:58</time> When\
