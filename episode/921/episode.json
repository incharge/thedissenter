He is a philosopher of mind whose research and teaching focus is perception and consciousness, and the philosophy of art. He is the author of Action in Perception; Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness; Varieties of Presence; Strange Tools: Art and Human Nature and, most recently, The Entanglement: How Art and Philosophy Make Us What We Are.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Entanglement. We discuss what art is, how art relates to the study of perception, embodied cognition, and the entanglement between life and art. We talk about human nature, and how we need to go beyond science to have a full understanding of the human experience. We discuss what philosophy is, and whether it is exclusively done by professional philosophers. We talk about the relationship between art and ethics. We discuss whether and how science relates to philosophy and art. Finally, we talk about how we can make sense of our feelings of uneasiness and uncertainty in the current cultural and political context through the framework that Dr. Noë presents in the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> What is art?  \n<time>07:07</time> The entanglement between life and art  \n<time>22:27</time> What is human nature?  \n<time>32:57</time> Going beyond science in understanding the human experience  \n<time>42:27</time> Is philosophy only for the professional philosophers?  \n<time>57:53</time> How does science relate to philosophy and art?  \n<time>1:04:49</time> Understanding our feelings of uneasiness in the current cultural and political context  \n<time>1:13:54</time> Follow Dr. Noë’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Noë’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3EQdpVf  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/46VyPNh  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3PrHgZ3  \nThe Entanglement: https://bit.ly/3EMWbIq\n",
