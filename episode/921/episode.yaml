shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 16th 2024.  \nDr. Alva No\xEB is Professor and Chair\
  \ of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a philosopher of\
  \ mind whose research and teaching focus is perception and consciousness, and the\
  \ philosophy of art. He is the author of Action in Perception; Out of Our Heads:\
  \ Why You Are Not Your Brain and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness;\
  \ Varieties of Presence; Strange Tools: Art and Human Nature and, most recently,\
  \ The Entanglement: How Art and Philosophy Make Us What We Are.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Entanglement. We discuss what art is, how art relates to the study\
  \ of perception, embodied cognition, and the entanglement between life and art.\
  \ We talk about human nature, and how we need to go beyond science to have a full\
  \ understanding of the human experience. We discuss what philosophy is, and whether\
  \ it is exclusively done by professional philosophers. We talk about the relationship\
  \ between art and ethics. We discuss whether and how science relates to philosophy\
  \ and art. Finally, we talk about how we can make sense of our feelings of uneasiness\
  \ and uncertainty in the current cultural and political context through the framework\
  \ that Dr. No\xEB presents in the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
