shownotes: "Dr. Luke Glowacki is Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at Boston University and a faculty affiliate of the Center for Innovation in Social\
  \ Science. He studies the evolution of complex social behavior, including cooperation\
  \ and war.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of war, and human cooperation.\
  \ We start by defining war, and we go through the main sources used to study its\
  \ origins, including animal models, archaeological evidence, and contemporary traditional\
  \ societies. We tackle the myth that ancestral populations did not have anything\
  \ to fight over or were too egalitarian to wage war, and also the myth that nomadic\
  \ societies did not make peace. We discuss the main points of disagreement between\
  \ the deep-rooters and the shallow-rooters, the best evidence and arguments from\
  \ both sides, and the epistemic and moral implications of the debate. We then talk\
  \ about large-scale cooperation in small-scale societies, and the main costs and\
  \ benefits of intergroup cooperation and aggression. Finally, we discuss if peace\
  \ is easy to maintain, and the role of key individuals in coalitional conflict.\n\
