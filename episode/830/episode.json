Their work over the past decade has centered around a single theme: eschatology, whether religious, secular, or scientific. Recently, their work has been focused on the nature and causes of human extinction, its ethical implications, and the history of the idea.  They are the author of Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing: An Introduction to Existential Risks, and their latest book is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about effective altruism and longtermism. We discuss the philosophical tenets of effective altruism (EA), whether it is utilitarian, and if it is more “rational” than other moral theories. We get into criticisms of EA, regarding how “effective” it really is; not caring about systemic change; and criticisms of philanthropy. We then talk about longtermism: where it comes from; the existential risks it cares about; caring about future people at the expense of people alive right now; and the link between longtermism and eugenics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time> The philosophical tenets of effective altruism  \n<time>04:02</time> Is effective altruism utilitarian?  \n<time>07:31</time> Is effective altruism more “rational” than other moral theories?  \n<time>10:16</time> What does “effective” mean?  \n<time>22:33</time> Not caring about systemic change  \n<time>28:44</time> Is philanthropy good?  \n<time>34:22</time> Longtermism, and where it comes from  \n<time>37:36</time> The existential risks longtermists care about  \n<time>43:08</time> Caring about future people at the expense of people alive right now  \n<time>58:16</time> The link between longtermism and eugenics  \n<time>1:06:28</time> Follow Dr. Torres’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Torres’ work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3BUcz8j  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3qbrU1S  \nHuman Extinction (book): https://bit.ly/3OGrXgi  \nTwitter handle: @xriskology\n",
