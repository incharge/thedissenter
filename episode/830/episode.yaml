shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 25th 2023.  \nDr. \xC9mile Torres is a researcher at\
  \ Leibniz Universit\xE4t Hannover, in Germany. Their work over the past decade has\
  \ centered around a single theme: eschatology, whether religious, secular, or scientific.\
  \ Recently, their work has been focused on the nature and causes of human extinction,\
  \ its ethical implications, and the history of the idea.  They are the author of\
  \ Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing: An Introduction to Existential Risks,\
  \ and their latest book is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics\
  \ of Annihilation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about effective altruism and longtermism.\
  \ We discuss the philosophical tenets of effective altruism (EA), whether it is\
  \ utilitarian, and if it is more \u201Crational\u201D than other moral theories.\
  \ We get into criticisms of EA, regarding how \u201Ceffective\u201D it really is;\
  \ not caring about systemic change; and criticisms of philanthropy. We then talk\
  \ about longtermism: where it comes from; the existential risks it cares about;\
  \ caring about future people at the expense of people alive right now; and the link\
  \ between longtermism and eugenics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro \
