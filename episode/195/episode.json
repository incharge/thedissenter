At the beginning, we define violence, and talk about ways of creating a classification system for it. We then get into three main types of violence and many of their ramifications – dyadic violence, collective/social violence, and self-inflicted violence. In dyadic violence, we discuss mostly violence within and between the sexes and violence within families. After that, we talk about collective violence, the relationship between morality and violence, war, collective punishment of individuals, and social ostracization. Finally, we get into self-inflicted violence, and focus almost exclusively on suicide and its many dimensions, also discussing depression and the problems with psychopathological approaches to human behavior. We refer specifically to the by-product theory of suicide as put forth by Cas Soper in his book, The Evolution of Suicide.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:54</time> What is violence?  \n<time>07:02</time> Violence is not a cultural construct                                                             \n<time>09:21</time> Trying to develop a classification system for human violence                                               \n<time>12:21</time> Individuals are not indiscriminately violent                                               \n<time>16:49</time> Dyadic violence.
