His books include The Origin of Empire: Rome from the Republic to Hadrian, Constantine the Emperor, The Victor's Crown: A History of Ancient Sport from Homer to Byzantium, and Theodora: Actress, Empress, Saint. His new book is Disruption: Why Things Change.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Disruption. We first define disruption, and discuss the factors and causes of disruption. We go through several examples of historical disruptions, like the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire, Mohammad and the spread of Islam, Christianity in Europe and the Holy Roman Empire, the Protestant Reformation, the American and the French revolutions, and more recent disruptions, like the Bolshevik revolution and the Nazi regime. Finally, we talk about possible contemporary disruptions, and how to deal with them.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time> Disruptions, and their causes  \n<time>10:05</time> Christianity in the Roman Empire  \n<time>17:18</time> Mohammad and Islam  \n<time>26:28</time> Christianity in Europe, and the Holy Roman Empire  \n<time>29:23</time> The Protestant Reformation  \n<time>38:58</time> The American and French revolutions  \n<time>43:47</time> Recent disruptions  \n<time>48:03</time> Contemporary disruptions  \n<time>54:38</time> Predicting and preventing disruptions  \n<time>58:33</time> Follow Dr. Potter’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Potter’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3uYerqZ  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3v6J4dE  \nDisruption: https://amzn.to/2SiP1aa\n",
