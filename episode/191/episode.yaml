shownotes: "Dr. Susan Blackmore is a psychologist, lecturer and writer researching\
  \ consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the\
  \ University of Plymouth. She is best known for her book The Meme Machine, and has\
  \ written or contributed to over 40 books, mostly on consciousness.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on memetics. First, Dr. Blackmore gives a proper definition of memetics,\
  \ and then we talk about some specific criticisms, some of them coming from my interviews\
  \ with Drs. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, namely units of culture, and memes\
  \ as viruses. We briefly discuss free will, and then move on to talk about imitation\
  \ as the basis for memetics, and other cognitive mechanisms that an animal needs\
  \ to have culture and memes. Toward the end, we also talk about how new technologies,\
  \ like the internet, are changing the way memetics works.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:43</time>\
  \ What is memetics about?  \n<time>04:07</time> Can we talk about a \u201Cunit of\
  \ culture\u201D?                                             \n<time>07:06</time>\
  \ Memes as viruses?                                      \n<time>11:53</time> Do\
  \ we really have free will?                                                  \n\
  <time>20:56</time> Why are certain memes bad for us?                           \
  \                \n<time>24:10</time> Imitation as a basis for memetics        \
  \                            \n<time>29:30</time> Do other animals also have memes?\
  \                        \n<time>33:49</time> Biases in culture/meme transmission\
  \                 \n<time>41:13</time> Could memetics give us a new approach to\
  \ explain evolutionary mysteries?       \n<time>47:29</time> New technologies and\
  \ their impact on memetics  \n<time>55:33</time> Follow Dr. Blackmore\u2019s work!\n\
