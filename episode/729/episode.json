He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and is the author of more than one hundred scholarly papers and several academic books. His latest book is Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Between Ape and Human. We first talk about Homo floresiensis: its discovery, its traits, and its relation to other hominins. We then get into the ethnographic work Dr. Forth did with peoples from the island of Flores. We go into more detail about the Lio people and their myth of the “ape-man”. We discuss if the “ape-man” could be H. floresiensis. We talk about the extent to which anthropologists can rely on people’s claims. Finally, we discuss how humans relate to (and think about) “not-quite-human” animals.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> Homo floresiensis – its discovery, its traits, and its relation to other hominins  \n<time>07:55</time> Peoples of the island of Flores  \n<time>15:48</time> The Lio people and the myth of the “ape-man”  \n<time>19:53</time> Can the “ape-man” be H. floresiensis?  \n<time>34:20</time> To what extent can anthropologists rely on people’s claims?  \n<time>38:50</time> How humans relate to “not-quite-human” animals  \n<time>50:22</time> Follow Dr. Forth’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Forth’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3QW4qGG  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3bAEBfl  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3I1ncc0  \nBetween Ape and Human: https://amzn.to/3xXtfcY\n",
