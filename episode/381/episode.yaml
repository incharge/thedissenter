excerpt: "Dr. Virgil Zeigler-Hill is Professor of Psychology and Director of Graduate\
  \ Training at Oakland University. He is a social-personality psychologist with primary\
  \ research interests in four interrelated areas: (1) self-esteem, (2) narcissism,\
  \ (3) cognitive representations of the self, and (4) interpersonal relationships.\
  \ His research concerning self-esteem has largely focused on the potential causes\
  \ and consequences of fragile high self-esteem. More recently, his research in this\
  \ area has led to the development of the status-signaling model of self-esteem.\
  \ His research concerning narcissism has examined the feelings of self-worth possessed\
  \ by individuals with narcissistic personality features. His work in the area of\
  \ cognitive representations of the self has examined the association between features\
  \ of the self-concept (i.e., content and structure) and psychological adjustment.\
  \ Finally, in the area of interpersonal relationships, he examines how beliefs about\
  \ the self and one\u2019s partner influence intimacy, relationship satisfaction,\
  \ and longevity in close relationships."
