His scholarly work is currently focused on political, economic and historical sociology, particularly longstanding social issues related to democracy and capitalism. His lastest book is Capitalism for Realists: Virtues and Vices of the Modern Economy (Routledge, 2022).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Capitalism for Realists. We start by defining capitalism, and talk about people’s current views on capitalism and socialism. We discuss what Marx got wrong about capitalism, Marxist and libertarian perspectives, and Dr. Rutar’s approach. We talk about different explanations for the origins of capitalism, from Weber, Henrich, and Mokyr; an alternative explanation for its development in 15th and 16th-century England; and we also address explanations based on cultural superiority. We get into topics like market exploitation and the minimum wage; the relationship between capitalism and poverty; economic inequality; the term “neoliberalism”; and claims about the moral effects of markets. Finally, we talk about climate change, and discuss if it is caused by capitalism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:52</time> Defining capitalism  \n<time>04:24</time> People’s views on capitalism and socialism  \n<time>07:12</time> What did Marx get wrong about capitalism?  \n<time>12:09</time> Marxist and libertarian perspectives, and Dr. Rutar’s approach  \n<time>14:57</time> The origins of capitalism: Weber’s, Henrich’s, and Mokyr’s explanations  \n<time>19:00</time> An alternative explanation for the development of capitalism in 15th and 16th-century England  \n<time>25:18</time> Explanations based on cultural superiority  \n<time>28:10</time> Market exploitation and the minimum wage  \n<time>35:18</time> The relationship between capitalism and poverty  \n<time>42:01</time> Economic inequality: is it on the rise?
