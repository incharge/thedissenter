His research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of political communication, public opinion, and political behavior. Via a combination of experimental methods, large datasets, machine learning, and innovative measurement, he studies how people choose, process, spread, and respond to information about politics. Recent work investigates the extent to which online Americans' news habits are polarized (the popular \"echo chambers\" hypothesis), patterns in the consumption and spread of online misinformation, and the effectiveness of efforts to counteract misperceptions encountered on social media.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about political polarization, misinformation, and digital media literacy. We start with online political polarization, and the phenomenon of eco chambers. We get into misinformation and fake news on digital media. We ask if political ads work, and if online surveys are reliable. Finally, we talk about some of the solutions to fight back against misinformation, including fact-checking and digital media literacy. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> Political polarization (online), and eco chambers  \n<time>16:52</time> Misinformation and fake news  \n<time>37:57</time> Political ads, and online surveys  \n<time>42:34</time> Does fact-checking work?  \n<time>44:54</time> Digital media literacy  \n<time>53:19</time> Follow Dr. Guess’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Guess’ work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2PtPuV4  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3edEXIc  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3kMFlOW  \nTwitter handle: @andyguess\n",
