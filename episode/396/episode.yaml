shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 5th 2020.  \nDr. Jeff McMahan is White\u2019s Professor\
  \ of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics,\
  \ Political Philosophy, and Ethics. He\u2019s the author of books like The Morality\
  \ of Nationalism, The Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing\
  \ in War.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the killing in war, and the ethics of\
  \ vegetarianism/veganism. About killing in ward, we address questions like what\
  \ is a just and an unjust war, the circumstances where soldiers are morally justified\
  \ to kill other soldiers, excusable conditions for participating in war, when civilians\
  \ might be liable to being targeted by soldiers, coercion, and teaching moral philosophy\
  \ to soldiers. In the second part, we discuss the ethics of vegetarianism, and we\
  \ go through different objections to it, like the pleasure we derive from eating\
  \ meat, the possibility of the extinction of farm animals, and raising animals in\
  \ a humane way. We also talk about eating already dead animals, cannibalism, and\
  \ lab-grown meat.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:33</time> Killing in war  \n<time>03:48</time>\
