He is the author of Why It’s OK to Make Bad Choices.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Why It’s OK to Make Bad Choices. We first discuss how we determine that a particular choice is a bad one. We talk about paternalism – coercive and libertarian. We discuss matters related to free will, and State regulations. We talk about the potential life benefits of making bad choices, and if people should care about their effects on others. We discuss if there are cases where other people should interfere. Finally, Dr. Glod tells us if, generally-speaking, it is OK for people to make bad choices.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:32</time> What is a bad choice?  \n<time>05:40</time> Paternalism – coercive and libertarian  \n<time>09:53</time> Does it matter if people do not have free will?  \n<time>11:41</time> State regulations  \n<time>15:49</time> Should people make bad choices?  \n<time>22:51</time> Should we care about the effects our decisions have on others?  \n<time>26:06</time> Are there cases where other people should interfere?  \n<time>33:11</time> Can people delegate decisions to other people?  \n<time>34:53</time> Is it okay for people to make bad choices?  \n<time>35:27</time> Follow Dr. Glod’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Glod’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/2RJtgA0  \nWhy It’s OK to Make Bad Choices: https://amzn.to/3ujNsWk\n",
