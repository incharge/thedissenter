  \ Fellow in the Cognitive Development Center at Central European University. He\
  \ is a cognitive scientist broadly interested in the evolution and development of\
  \ social cognition. His research focuses on how the mind represents the social world\
  \ in terms of its constituent interactions, relations, and structures. He strives\
  \ to develop a mechanistically tractable account of how humans from the first years\
  \ of life form and flexibly transition among these representations.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about how infants interpret giving and taking actions, and the development\
  \ of prosociality. We start with giving and taking actions, and talk about expectations\
  \ surrounding giving; how infants think about possession; norms of ownership, and\
  \ how they vary cross-culturally; expectations surrounding reciprocation; how infants\
  \ infer social relations from giving and taking actions; and how giving actions\
  \ influence how they encode objects. We then get into prosociality, and ask if infants\
  \ prefer helpers or hinderers. Finally, we discuss if there are stages of development\
  \ for prosociality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time>\
