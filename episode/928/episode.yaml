shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 4th 2024.  \nDr. Charles Roseman is an Associate Professor\
  \ of evolution, ecology and behavior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\
  \ He studies the evolution of complex traits.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk\
  \ about complex traits and how we study their evolution, and we talk about adaptations,\
  \ by-products, phenotypic plasticity, and genetic drift. We discuss the limitations\
  \ of adaptationism. We talk about the example of the evolution of the cranium in\
  \ hominins, and hybridization in human evolution. We then discuss group differences,\
  \ the debate between the hereditarians and the anti-hereditarians, and questions\
  \ surrounding differences in intelligence and IQ, and the concept of race. We also\
  \ talk about issues with mechanistic explanations for the anti-hereditarian position,\
  \ and the role of genes in group differences. We discuss the factors that play a\
  \ role in variation in body form among human groups, and how developmental processes\
  \ shape evolution. Finally, we talk about Drs. Roseman and Ocobock\u2019s Scientific\
  \ American article, \u201CTo Understand Sex, We Need to Ask the Right Questions\u201D\
