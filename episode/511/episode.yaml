shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 10th 2021.  \nDr. C\xE9cile Sarabian is a Postdoctoral\
  \ researcher in Cognitive Ecology at Kyoto University. She investigates parasite\
  \ avoidance behaviors and their effectiveness in non-human primates and other animals\
  \ via field and lab experimentation/observations. She is generally interested in\
  \ the origins of hygiene and disgust in humans and in the potential applications\
  \ of disgust into the field of Conservation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about disgust\
  \ and conservation. We start by discussing disgust from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We talk about different disgust-related behaviors, and hygiene. We mention briefly\
  \ how an evolutionary perspective can inform how people deal with the covid-19 pandemic,\
  \ and how they react to pathogens in this context. We delve into the discussion\
  \ surrounding the different domains of disgust (pathogen disgust, sexual disgust,\
  \ and moral disgust). We also do a bit of comparative psychology, and explore to\
  \ what extent we can compare non-human primates to us. We also talk about sex differences\
  \ in disgust, and human universals in disgust reactions. Finally, we talk about\
  \ new avenues to explore when it comes to the role disgust might play in animal\
  \ conservation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time>\
