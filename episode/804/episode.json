She studies how ant colonies work without central control using networks of simple interactions, and how these networks evolve in relation to changing environments. Her projects include a long-term study of a population of harvester ant colonies in Arizona, studies of the invasive Argentine ant in northern California, arboreal ant trail networks and ant-plant mutualisms in Central America.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about ant colonies. We discuss decision-making from an ecological perspective, and distributed problem solving. We talk about the tole of genetics and the environment in ant sociality. We discuss task allocation, and why “division of labor” is not a good term to apply here. We talk about how ants recognize nestmates. We discuss genetic relatedness, kin selection, group selection, and the debate surrounding levels of selection in evolutionary biology. We talk about ant personality. We discuss if there are hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies. Finally, we discuss if the study of ants can help us understand other systems that work without central control, and if we can extrapolate from ants to humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> Decision-making from an ecological perspective  \n<time>01:35</time> Distributed problem solving  \n<time>02:47</time> The role of genetics and the environment in ant behavior  \n<time>05:53</time> Task allocation in ant colonies  \n<time>12:09</time> Do ants recognize nestmates?  \n<time>15:15</time> Do ants move between colonies?  \n<time>17:51</time> Genetic relatedness, kin selection, and group selection  \n<time>23:05</time> Levels of selection in evolutionary biology  \n<time>24:49</time> Do ants have personalities?  \n<time>29:48</time> Are there hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies?  \n<time>33:21</time> Can ants help us understand other systems that work without central control?  \n<time>35:19</time> Extrapolating from ants to humans  \n<time>39:30</time> Follow Dr. Gordon’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Gordon’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3I9QbML  \nThe Gordon Lab: https://bit.ly/3WO4xq2  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3sMaarH  \nAmazon page: https://bit.ly/3vrFBsN\n",
