  \ Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Medical Humanities program at the\
  \ University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Her work is in philosophy of science/medicine,\

  \ Responses to the Crisis in Mental Health Research, which adopts a Kuhnian approach\
  \ to make sense of the existing research landscape in psychiatry.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about philosophy of psychiatry. We first delve into the biological and\
  \ cultural aspects of mental disorders. We discuss how important cultural and social\
  \ factors are for how people deal with mental disorders. We talk about the self\
  \ and flourishing, and the role they play in a clinical context. We talk about how\
  \ AI is used to treat mental disorders, and if we should use it. We talk a bit about\
  \ the mental effects of the covid-19 pandemic, and to what extent it really increased\
  \ mental illness. Finally, we discuss if psychiatry is a science. \n\nTime Links:\
