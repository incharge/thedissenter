shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 4th 2024.  \nDr. Philip Ball is a freelance science\
  \ writer, with a BA in Chemistry from the University of Oxford and a PhD in Physics\
  \ from the University of Bristol. He was an editor at Nature for over 20 years.\
  \ He is the author of many popular books on science, including The Book of Minds:\
  \ How to Understand Ourselves and Other Beings, from Animals to AI to Aliens.\n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on The Book of Minds. We start by discussing the solipsist\
  \ position, what a mind is, the idea of the \u201Cspace of possible minds\u201D\
  , and the relationship between the mind and the brain. We talk about human evolved\
  \ psychology, the relationship between reason and emotion, and neurodiversity. We\
  \ discuss how we think about the minds of other beings, whether we can know what\
  \ it is like to be another animal, and whether plants might have minds. We also\
  \ talk about the possible minds of AI systems, the value of imagining the minds\
  \ of possible aliens, and how discussions surrounding free will inform how we think\
  \ about the mind.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time>\
