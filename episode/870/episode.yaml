  \ at the Social & Cognitive Origins Group at Johns Hopkins University. She is interested\
  \ in how evolutionary pressures have shaped the minds of different species, and\
  \ which cognitive mechanisms animals employ while interacting with the world around\
  \ them. Her current work focuses on how chimpanzees perceive third-party social\
  \ interactions through eye-tracking technology, alongside research on dog cognition.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about animal cognition and comparative psychology. We\
  \ start by talking about kea parrots, and their tool use and tool innovation. We\
  \ discuss the problem with the \u201Cbird brain\u201D expression, and animal culture.\
  \ We go through aspects of animal cognition like na\xEFve realism; contrafreeloading;\
  \ statistical inference: the ability to represent both the identity and trajectory\
  \ of hidden objects, and how it relates to causal understanding; and interspecies\
  \ communication. We talk about how the study of animal cognition can contribute\
  \ to the conservation of species. We get into dog cognition, and discuss if dogs\
  \ experience jealousy. Finally, we talk about comparative psychology, and convergent\
  \ evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:51  Kea parrots  \n06:37  The problem\
