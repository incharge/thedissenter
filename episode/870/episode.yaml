  Group at Johns Hopkins University. She is interested in how evolutionary pressures
  have shaped the minds of different species, and which cognitive mechanisms animals
  employ while interacting with the world around them. Her current work focuses on
  how chimpanzees perceive third-party social interactions through eye-tracking technology,
  alongside research on dog cognition.

shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 9th 2023.  \nDr. Amalia Bastos is a Postdoctoral Fellow\
  \ at the Social & Cognitive Origins Group at Johns Hopkins University. She is interested\
  \ in how evolutionary pressures have shaped the minds of different species, and\
  \ which cognitive mechanisms animals employ while interacting with the world around\
  \ them. Her current work focuses on how chimpanzees perceive third-party social\
  \ interactions through eye-tracking technology, alongside research on dog cognition.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about animal cognition and comparative psychology. We\
  \ start by talking about kea parrots, and their tool use and tool innovation. We\
  \ discuss the problem with the \u201Cbird brain\u201D expression, and animal culture.\
  \ We go through aspects of animal cognition like na\xEFve realism; contrafreeloading;\
  \ statistical inference: the ability to represent both the identity and trajectory\
  \ of hidden objects, and how it relates to causal understanding; and interspecies\
  \ communication. We talk about how the study of animal cognition can contribute\
  \ to the conservation of species. We get into dog cognition, and discuss if dogs\
  \ experience jealousy. Finally, we talk about comparative psychology, and convergent\
  \ evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> Kea\
