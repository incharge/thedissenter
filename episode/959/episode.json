	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 31st 2024.  \nEdgar Dubourg is a PhD candidate in cognitive science at the D\u00e9partement d\u2019\u00c9tudes Cognitives at the \u00c9cole Normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS-PSL). He uses insights from both the natural sciences (behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, cognitive neuroscience) and the humanities (literary theory, literary history, cultural studies), and both computational and experimental methods, to explain the psychological foundations and the cultural evolution of fictions.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychological foundations of fictions. We start by discussing what fiction is, and how old it is in human societies. We talk about evolutionary precursors to fiction. We discuss whether is it an evolved adaptation. We talk about the cognitive mechanisms behind fiction, and its (social) functions and signaling functions. We discuss two hypotheses to explain fiction: the entertainment hypothesis, and the information hypothesis. We talk about why so many people are fascinated by imaginary worlds, and how that might be explained by inter-individual differences in exploratory behavior. We also discuss how to approach the study of fictional genres, and cross-cultural differences in fiction. Finally, we settle an old One Piece debate.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> What is fiction, and how old is it in human societies?  \n<time>11:01</time> Evolutionary precursors to fiction  \n<time>13:28</time> Is fiction an evolved adaptation?  \n<time>20:10</time> The cognitive mechanisms behind fiction  \n<time>24:06</time> The (social) functions of fiction  \n<time>34:17</time> The entertainment hypothesis, and the information hypothesis  \n<time>38:33</time> Proximate explanations for fiction  \n<time>41:08</time> Why are people fascinated by imaginary worlds?  \n<time>49:57</time> Inter-individual differences in exploratory behavior  \n<time>59:36</time> Personality traits  \n<time>1:05:55</time> How to approach the study of fictional genres  \n<time>1:14:28</time> Cross-cultural differences in fiction  \n<time>1:19:26</time> Settling a One Piece debate  \n<time>1:20:59</time> Follow Edgar\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Edgar\u2019s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3roYEFU  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/462D2y9  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/461o6jz  \nTwitter handle: @EdgarDubourg\n",
