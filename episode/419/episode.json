He’s the author of Why Free Will Is Real.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Why Free Will Is Real. We start with some basic questions, like what is free will, and what is an agent. We then get into the moral side of things, and talk about moral responsibility and the law. We address three major challenges to free will (the “challenge from radical materialism,” the “challenge from determinism,” and the “challenge from epiphenomenalism”). We discuss mind-brain dualism and emergentism. Finally, we ask if free will exists in other living beings, in nonliving entities, and in robots and advanced AI.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:28</time> What is free will?  \n<time>11:47</time> Free will and morality  \n<time>23:05</time> Challenges to free will (the “challenge from radical materialism,” the “challenge from determinism,” and the “challenge from epiphenomenalism”)  \n<time>1:03:37</time> Mind-brain dualism  \n<time>1:06:16</time> Emergentism  \n<time>1:08:08</time> Free will in other living beings  \n<time>1:16:57</time> Free will in nonliving entities  \n<time>1:19:39</time> Robots and AI  \n<time>1:24:39</time> Follow List’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. List’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2IpMm9j  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3lov8YE  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3ksNs1g  \nWhy Free Will Is Real: https://amzn.to/2Iu7VpD\n",
