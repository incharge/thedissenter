She’s the editor of Squeezing Minds From Stones: Cognitive Archaeology and the Evolution of the Human Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about cognitive archaeology. First, we go through some basics, and ask what are archaeological remnants, and where archaeology starts in our evolutionary history, and we also talk about cumulative culture, and the discipline of cognitive archaeology. We discuss if modern hunter-gatherers make for good models of ancient peoples, and what we can learn about cognition from ancient artifacts. We ask if technology expands our cognitive capacities, and the get into more specific topics, like the relationship between tool-making and tool-use and conceptualization, and language. We also talk about numeracy and literacy. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:57</time> What are archaeological remnants?  \n<time>05:38</time> Cumulative culture  \n<time>08:31</time> Cognitive archaeology  \n<time>15:44</time> Are modern hunter-gatherers good models of ancient peoples?  \n<time>19:12</time> What can we learn about cognition from archaeological remnants?  \n<time>22:33</time> Recreating ancient artifacts  \n<time>25:00</time> Does technology expand our cognitive capacities?  \n<time>27:50</time> Tools and concepts  \n<time>33:27</time> Objects and language  \n<time>38:07</time> Numeracy  \n<time>43:59</time> Counting with objects  \n<time>50:23</time> Hypotheses in cognitive archaeology  \n<time>53:27</time> Tool-making and the evolution of language  \n<time>1:00:32</time> Follow Dr. Overmann’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Overmann’s work:  \nThe Center for Cognitive Archaeology: https://bit.ly/2Yms9WV  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3ldHMtV  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3ggsErN  \nSqueezing Minds From Stones: https://amzn.to/31eeGCy\n",
