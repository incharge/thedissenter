We explore the evolutionary bases of rape; the sex differences and optimal sexual strategies that give rise to it; why women suffer so much from it, and the possible social consequences; what’s wrong with social constructionist theories of rape, and why don’t really help the victims or with its prevention; and science-based solutions to it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:40</time> How evolutionary theory helps us understand rape better        \n<time>04:14</time> Sex differences in sexual strategies     \n<time>07:40</time> Why is rape so painful to women?  \n<time>10:30</time> The risk for women to lose a male partner after getting raped     \n<time>11:41</time> Traits the pose an increasing risk of rape for women      \n<time>19:38</time> Rape is not a cultural construct       \n<time>21:16</time> Signs of physical violence and resistance reduce mate leaving    \n<time>25:48</time> Are men also victims of rape?  \n<time>29:12</time> Why social constructionist theories of rape don’t help  \n<time>34:48</time> Science-based policies to prevent rape  \n<time>43:01</time> Is advice for women to prevent rape sexist, or “victim-blaming”?  \n<time>45:43</time> Evolutionary theory applied to clinical psychology  \n<time>47:08</time> Follow Dr. Thornhill’s work        \n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Thornhill’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://biology.unm.edu/Thornhill/rthorn.htm  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/y95a5myn\n",
