shownotes: "Dr. Isabella Sarto-Jackson is Lecturer in Cognitive Science at the University\
  \ of Vienna, Guest Lecturer in Cognitive Biology at the University of Bratislava,\
  \ executive manager of the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research,\
  \ and president of the Austrian Neuroscience Association (ANA). She is the author\
  \ of The Making and Breaking of Minds: How social interactions shape the human mind.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Making and Breaking of Minds. We go through topics\
  \ in human psychology, including the nature/nurture debate; behavior genetics, twin\
  \ studies, and the role of genes; the idea of genetic susceptibility, instead of\
  \ genetic determinism; how to study environmental factors; niche construction; and\
  \ gene-culture coevolution. We also discuss neuroscience: the concept of neuroplasticity,\
  \ how it works and its limits; and localizationism, modularity of mind, and evolutionary\
  \ psychology. We talk about issues with how we understand \u201Cnormal\u201D development\
  \ and psychopathology; \u201Clooping effects\u201D in the study of mental disorders;\
  \ the biopsychosocial model; socioeconomic structures and systemic discrimination;\
  \ and the neurodiversity movement. We also discuss what traumatic experiences are;\
  \ attachment theory, and how we develop attachment styles; and how children develop\
  \ resilience. We finish by commenting on how science works.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
