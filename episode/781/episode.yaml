  \ Newark. His expertise lies in cultural anthropology, the anthropology of war,\
  \ ethnic conflict, state-tribe interaction, policing, and Puerto Rico. Dr. Ferguson\
  \ has published many papers critical of biological perspectives in anthropology,\
  \ especially explanations of war. His latest book is \u201CChimpanzees, War, and\
  \ History: Are Men Born to Kill?\u201D.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Chimpanzees,\
  \ War, and History. We start by talking about the history of the belief in a \u201C\
  death instinct\u201D and aggressive drives, and what is war. We go through different\
  \ cases of chimpanzee groups \u2013 Gombe, Mahale, and Kibale -, and get into detail\
  \ about the Four-Year War; human interference; chimp territoriality; the rise of\
  \ sociobiology; the Imbalance of Power Hypothesis; the Resource Competition Hypothesis;\
  \ the Human Impact Hypothesis; the Display Violence Hypothesis; when chimps resort\
  \ to violence; the aftermath of the war; and issues with counting killings. We discuss\
  \ the best ways to study violence in chimpanzees. We also talk about bonobos, the\
  \ demonic perspective applied to human warfare, and Dr. Ferguson\u2019s anthropological\
  \ theory of war.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:47</time>\
