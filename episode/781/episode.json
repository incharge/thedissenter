Dr. Ferguson has published many papers critical of biological perspectives in anthropology, especially explanations of war. His latest book is “Chimpanzees, War, and History: Are Men Born to Kill?”.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Chimpanzees, War, and History. We start by talking about the history of the belief in a “death instinct” and aggressive drives, and what is war. We go through different cases of chimpanzee groups – Gombe, Mahale, and Kibale -, and get into detail about the Four-Year War; human interference; chimp territoriality; the rise of sociobiology; the Imbalance of Power Hypothesis; the Resource Competition Hypothesis; the Human Impact Hypothesis; the Display Violence Hypothesis; when chimps resort to violence; the aftermath of the war; and issues with counting killings. We discuss the best ways to study violence in chimpanzees. We also talk about bonobos, the demonic perspective applied to human warfare, and Dr. Ferguson’s anthropological theory of war.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:47</time> The history of the belief in a “death instinct” and aggressive drives  \n<time>09:05</time> What is war?  \n<time>11:23</time> Jane Goodall’s initial work on Gombe chimps  \n<time>15:14</time> “The Great Revision”  \n<time>21:29</time> The Four-Year War  \n<time>25:09</time> How human activity created and shaped intergroup tensions leading to the War  \n<time>31:59</time> Chimp territoriality  \n<time>33:59</time> The rise of sociobiology  \n<time>37:53</time> Interference mutualism and coalitional aggression  \n<time>41:26</time> The Imbalance of Power Hypothesis  \n<time>47:11</time> The Dominance Drive  \n<time>50:32</time> The Resource Competition Hypothesis  \n<time>54:51</time> The Human Impact Hypothesis  \n<time>56:25</time> The Display Violence Hypothesis  \n<time>1:02:40</time> When do chimps resort to violence?  \n<time>1:05:03</time> The aftermath of the war  \n<time>1:09:09</time> Issues with the counting of killings  \n<time>1:14:09</time> The Mahale case  \n<time>1:23:13</time> The Kibale case  \n<time>1:33:00</time> How to study violence in chimpanzees  \n<time>1:37:12</time> Bonobos  \n<time>1:46:42</time> Are most killers and victims male?  \n<time>1:50:06</time> The demonic perspective applied to human warfare  \n<time>1:56:22</time> Dr. Ferguson’s anthropological theory of war  \n<time>2:00:15</time> Follow Dr. Ferguson’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ferguson’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3w7mXHy  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3PJeGlr  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3Ci5EqS  \nChimpanzees, War, and History: https://bit.ly/3yYolNr\n",
