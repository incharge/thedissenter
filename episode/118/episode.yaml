  \ this episode, we cover the psychological phenomena that were the main targets\
  \ of Dr. Ross\u2019 academic research. These include: the fundamental attribution\
  \ error; the just world phenomenon; cultural differences in how people apply the\
  \ fundamental attribution error; na\xEFve realism, the false consensus effect, and\
  \ objectivity in the eye of the beholder; reactive devaluation in the case of trying\
  \ to solve a problem between opposing human groups or political parties; and the\
  \ possible ways to get around these human cognitive inclinations.\n\nTime Links:\
