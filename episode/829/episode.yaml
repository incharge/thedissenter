  \ Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers University, where she\
  \ holds a secondary appointment at the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science. She\
  \ specializes in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language and\
  \ is best known for her work on perceptual experience, evidence, capacities, mental\
  \ content, and imagination. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including a\
  \ Guggenheim Award, a Humboldt Prize, and a Mellon New Directions Fellowship for\
  \ a project on the Neuroscience of Perception. She is the author of The Unity of\
  \ Perception: Content, Consciousness, Evidence.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on\
  \ The Unity of Perception. We get into perception from a philosophical perspective,\
  \ and some of the most prominent approaches to it. We talk about analyzing the mind\
  \ in terms of capacities (capacitism). We discuss the role of context in perception,\
  \ and understanding the difference between perception and hallucination. We talk\
  \ about Dr. Schellenberg\u2019s Particularity Thesis of perception. We discuss perceptual\
  \ knowledge. We talk about the relation between perception and consciousness. We\
  \ discuss a constructivist perspective of perception, and how perception relates\
  \ to reality. We talk about the relation between perception and thought. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how capacitism deals with evidence and knowledge.\n\nTime Links:\
