shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 2nd 2023.  \nDr. Dale Greenwalt is Research Associate\
  \ in the laboratory of Dr. Conrad Labandeira, curator of fossil arthropods, in the\
  \ Paleobiology Department at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History.\
  \ His work centers on description of the insect fauna of the Coal Creek Member of\
  \ the Middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation in northwestern Montana. He is also interested\
  \ in defining the biological and geological processes that resulted in the preservation\
  \ of these insects and the original biomolecular components that are found in the\
  \ fossils of the Kishenehn Formation. He is the author of Remnants of Ancient Life:\
  \ The New Science of Old Fossils.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Remnants of Ancient\
  \ Life. We start by discussing what fossils are, and what we expect to learn from\
  \ them. We talk about how biomolecules are preserved, the origin of life on Earth,\
  \ a fossil of a blood-engorged mosquito, ancient pigments, biometals, proteins,\
  \ ancient DNA, and the evolution of plants. Finally, we discuss how much we could\
  \ potentially learn about the phylogenies and ancient physiologies of the total\
  \ biomass of the Earth through ancient biomolecules, and the future of the field.\n\
