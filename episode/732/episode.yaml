shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 30th 2022.  \nDr. Jonas Olson is Professor of Practical\
  \ Philosophy at Stockholm University. His research areas include metaethics and\
  \ related subjects.  \n\nIn this episode, we talk about metaethics, and practical\
  \ philosophy. We start by distinguishing metaethics from normative ethics and applied\
  \ ethics. We talk about the main questions and approaches in metaethics. We get\
  \ specifically into moral error theory, moral abolitionism, and moral nihilism.\
  \ We also discuss what moral facts are. We talk about moral certitude. Finally,\
  \ we discuss what practical philosophy is, and how it relates to theoretical philosophy.\n\
