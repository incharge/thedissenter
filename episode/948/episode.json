Her research topics include links between institutions and individuals; legitimacy; fairness; and post-communism.\n\nIn this episode, we start by discussing what democracy is, how we measure it, and some of its history. We talk about the election winner-loser gap and subjective wellbeing, and citizens’ support for democratic checks and balances. We discuss what civil society is, and its interplay with external actors. We talk about how political legitimacy is established, and what political capacity is. We get specifically into the European Union, and discuss its political legitimacy, respect for national sovereignty, and how it deals with public backlash. Finally, we talk about what drives public support for international humanitarian interventions.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> What is democracy, and how do we measure it?  \n<time>19:07</time> How old is democracy?  \n<time>32:58</time> The election winner-loser gap and subjective wellbeing  \n<time>43:15</time> Citizens’ support for democratic checks and balances  \n<time>48:15</time> Civil society, external actors, and their interplay  \n<time>1:07:40</time> Hybrid regimes  \n<time>1:10:57</time> How political legitimacy is established  \n<time>1:17:47</time> Political capacity  \n<time>1:24:13</time> The European Union: its legitimacy, respect for national sovereignty, and dealing with public backlash  \n<time>1:46:24</time> Public support for international humanitarian interventions  \n<time>1:52:03</time> Follow Dr. Mazepus’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mazepus’ work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3WxCgFj  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3MSO8yv  \nTwitter handle: @HMazepus\n",
