shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 17th 2021.  \nDr. Carole Hooven is Co-Director of Undergraduate\
  \ Studies and Lecturer in Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. Her\
  \ research Interests include behavioral endocrinology and evolution of sex differences\
  \ in humans (physiology, behavior and cognition). She is the author of T: The Story\
  \ of Testosterone, the Hormone that Dominates and Divides Us.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on T. We start with some basics, and talk about the physiological processes\
  \ testosterone participates in, and the activational-organizational paradigm. We\
  \ then discuss the behavioral effects of testosterone, and what we know about them\
  \ in infants and other closely-related species. We get into Wingfield\u2019s Challenge\
  \ Hypothesis. We ask if testosterone really does cause aggression, and how it correlates\
  \ with status-competition. We talk about conditions like Complete Androgen Insensitivity\
  \ Syndrome (CAIS) and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). We ask how sex is defined.\
  \ We get into some political questions, like transgender athletes, and testosterone\
  \ in sports. We discuss the concept of \u201Ctoxic masculinity\u201D. Finally, we\
  \ talk about the difficulties with communicating this kind of science.\n\nTime Links:\
