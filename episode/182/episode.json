We discuss the role that development plays in biology; the importance of the field of evolutionary psychology; the current state of the art of human epigenetics; behavioral genetics and the nature-nurture debate; what is “innate” in human psychology; behavioral plasticity; our long period of development as a species and what we acquire through it; some species-typical mental abilities, like imitation, theory of mind and culture; the importance of play; and implicit knowledge. We wrap up the interview by talking about evolutionary mismatch and how we are not adapted to certain aspects of our modern environment, and the problems that might bring; and also how we can apply this knowledge to develop better education systems. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:08</time> Biology, development, and evolutionary psychology  \n<time>07:55</time> We have to be careful about epigenetics                                  \n<time>10:09</time> Extreme environmentalism, Freud, Skinner, Piaget                                    \n<time>14:30</time> Behavioral genetics and the interactionist approach                                       \n<time>20:11</time> What is “innate” behavior?                                 \n<time>27:06</time> Behavioral plasticity in humans                             \n<time>35:03</time> The effects of the environment are biologically-mediated                      \n<time>38:02</time> Development need inputs from the environment             \n<time>40:16</time> The importance of our long periods of development    \n<time>45:16</time> Imitation, theory of mind, play  \n<time>51:14</time> The importance of culture  \n<time>54:46</time> Implicit knowledge (and core knowledge)  \n<time>59:19</time> Evolutionary mismatch, and problems in modern environments  \n<time>1:08:07</time> Applying this knowledge to Educational Psychology  \n<time>1:16:18</time> Follow Dr. Bjorklund’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Bjorklund’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2UeCwMs  \nAcademia.edu profile: https://bit.ly/2D0sdBg  \nArticles on Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2IIHBYk  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2TWi1PB\n\nBooks:  \nThe Origins of Human Nature: Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: https://amzn.to/2G2It6J  \nOrigins of the Social Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development: https://amzn.to/2YR4PPG  \nWhy Youth is Not Wasted on the Young: Immaturity in Human Development: https://amzn.to/2K9sY0T  \nChild and Adolescent Development: An Integrative Approach: https://amzn.to/2UwTt4f  \nChildren's Thinking: Cognitive Development and Individual Differences: https://amzn.to/2SzQweb\n",
