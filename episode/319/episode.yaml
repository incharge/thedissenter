shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th, 2020.  \nDr. Jeff McMahan is White\u2019s Professor\
  \ of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics,\
  \ Political Philosophy, and Ethics. He\u2019s the author of books like The Morality\
  \ of Nationalism, The Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing\
  \ in War.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the ethics of killing. We first clarify\
  \ what is death and what constitutes an act of killing. We discuss the connection\
  \ between psychological capacities and moral status, and the notions of personal\
  \ identity, egoistic concern, and the interest in one\u2019s future. We address\
  \ abortion and infanticide. We then get into a discussion surrounding how we decide\
  \ that a life is worth living. We also include topics like personality variability,\
  \ and end-of-life cases life euthanasia and suicide. We talk about what is a \u201C\
  good life\u201D for people and other animals. Finally, we explore what is ethically\
  \ different between killing and letting die.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:51</time>\
