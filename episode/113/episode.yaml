shownotes: "Dr. Joshua M. Tybur is an Associate Professor in the Department of Experimental\
  \ and Applied Psychology at VU Amsterdam. His work is dedicated to better understanding\
  \ how people solve some of the fundamental problems of life, including avoiding\
  \ infectious diseases, obtaining and retaining a mate, and navigating the threats\
  \ and affordances of interdependence. He approaches these topics with a combination\
  \ of ideas and techniques from social psychology, personality psychology, and evolutionary\
  \ biology.\n\nIn this episode, I talk with Dr. Tybur about the domains of the emotion\
  \ of disgust, from an evolutionary perspective; the relationship between disgust\
  \ and morality, and between disgust and political attitudes; sex differences in\
  \ disgust sensitivity. We also talk about politics and science, and the problem\
  \ of our own political preferences contaminating scientific research, and the importance\
  \ of giving social psychology a biological basis.  \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:18</time>\
