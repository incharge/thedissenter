  In this episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s OK to Enjoy the Work of Immoral Artists.\
  \ We first discuss how aesthetic questions might relate to ethical ones. We then\
  \ ask if art can itself be immoral. We discuss the complicated questions of how\
  \ and when the work of an artist should be condemned. We talk about the #metoo movement,\
  \ cancel culture, and the presumption of guilt. We get into how people should feel\
  \ about being influenced by immoral artists. We discuss if it matters that people\
  \ differ in their moral tastes. After focusing on artists and consumers, we also\
  \ mention platforms. Finally, we talk about ethical consumption in other domains.\
