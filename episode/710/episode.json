She is director of the Center for Social and Cultural Psychology in Leuven. She is the author of Between Us: How Cultures Create Emotions.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Between Us. We start by talking about what emotions are, and their functions. We discuss how people think about and categorize emotions, and the MINE (Mental, Inside, Essentialist) and OURS (Outside, Relational, Situational) models of emotions, and their relationship with wellbeing. We talk about raising children cross-culturally, and attachment styles. We go through a few emotions, like anger and shame, and love and happiness, how they manifest across cultures, and ask if love is at the basis of all intimate relationships, and if everyone cares about happiness. We talk about how language relates to emotion, and the developmental aspects associated with emotion acquisition. We discuss the applications of research on emotion, and how emotions also make culture. Finally, we talk about the work of Paul Ekman, evolutionary approaches to emotion, “basic emotions”, and the valence of emotions.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> What are emotions?  \n<time>05:01</time> The functions of emotions  \n<time>09:10</time> How people think about and categorize emotions  \n<time>20:01</time> MINE and OURS models of emotion  \n<time>31:44</time> Wellbeing  \n<time>37:08</time> The idea of emotions building up inside if not let out  \n<time>40:33</time> Raising children cross-culturally  \n<time>51:53</time> Attachment styles  \n<time>55:46</time> Shame and anger  \n<time>1:01:43</time> Love and happiness  \n<time>1:10:04</time> Language and emotion  \n<time>1:17:37</time> Are there critical periods in development for the acquisition of emotions?  \n<time>1:20:58</time> Living in a multicultural world  \n<time>1:24:59</time> Empathy  \n<time>1:27:43</time> The applications of research on emotions  \n<time>1:31:01</time> Do emotions also make culture?  \n<time>1:32:35</time> The work of Paul Ekman  \n<time>1:38:02</time> Evolutionary approaches to emotion  \n<time>1:42:15</time> Are there “basic emotions”?  \n<time>1:43:34</time> The valence of emotions  \n<time>1:45:30</time> Follow Dr. Mesquita’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mesquita’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3Po10Ln  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3Sa3DSC  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3Rv6jKZ  \nBetween Us: https://amzn.to/3Rt1wtr\n",
