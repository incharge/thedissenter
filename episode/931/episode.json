shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 10th 2024.  \nDr. Michael Hudson is President of the\
  \ Institute for the Study of Long-Term Economic Trends (ISLET), a Wall Street Financial\
  \ Analyst, and Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of\
  \ Missouri, Kansas City. He is the author of Super-Imperialism: The Economic Strategy\
  \ of American Empire (Editions 1968, 2003, 2021), \u201C\u2026and forgive them their\
  \ debts\u201D (2018), The Collapse of Antiquity, and his latest book, Temples of\
  \ Enterprise.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Collapse of Antiquity. We start\
  \ by talking about the historical origins of the notions of debtor and creditor,\
  \ the invention of debt cancellation, and interest-bearing debt. We discuss the\
  \ social consequences of not cancelling debts, and the relationship between debt\
  \ and wage labor. We explore the rise of creditor oligarchies in classical Greece\
  \ and Rome, the legacy of pro-creditor ideology, and the fall of the Roman Empire.\
  \ We talk about debt cancellation in early Christianity, and how Catholic doctrine\
  \ changed over time. Finally, we discuss what we can learn from what happened in\
  \ Greece and Rome, and our current predicament.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
