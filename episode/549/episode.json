He is an evolutionary biologist studying genomic conflicts. He is the author of The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution. We first introduce the idea, and walk-through concepts like the “selfish gene”, and the replicator-vehicle approach. We get into the debate surrounding levels of selection, and inclusive fitness theory and group selection. We talk about what evolutionary biologists think about the gene’s-eye view of evolution, and the best alternatives to it. We discuss the relationship between this perspective and adaptationism, and how it makes sense of phenomena like pleiotropy, polygeny, and sexual selection. We discuss some limitations of it when dealing with developmental biology. We talk about cultural selection, and if memetics has been successful as a scientific discipline. Finally, we talk about what the gene’s-eye view of evolution might have to say about human nature, and the moral nature of the Universe.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> What is the gene’s-eye view of evolution?  \n<time>04:36</time> The selfish gene  \n<time>06:35</time> The replicator-vehicle approach  \n<time>08:39</time> The debate about levels of selection  \n<time>11:44</time> Inclusive fitness theory, and group selection  \n<time>22:33</time> What evolutionary biologists think about the gene’s-eye view of evolution, and alternatives to it  \n<time>28:22</time> Adaptationism  \n<time>29:24</time> Pleiotropy and polygeny  \n<time>32:14</time> Sexual selection  \n<time>33:55</time> The evolution of altruism  \n<time>36:38</time> Development  \n<time>42:31</time> Cultural evolution, and memetics  \n<time>49:09</time> Human nature, and the moral nature of the Universe  \n<time>54:55</time> Follow Dr. Ågren’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ågren’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/2Tj4ffu  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3oJZA3I  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/2WUPmSD  \nThe Gene's-Eye View of Evolution: https://amzn.to/3iLgKKq  \nTwitter handle: @arvidagren\n",
