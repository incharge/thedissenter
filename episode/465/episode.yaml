  \ and Chair of the Department of Psychology at the College of Charleston. Her research\
  \ has been federally funded by the National Institutes of Health and she has published\
  \ her research in numerous scientific journals including Psychological Science,\
  \ Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, and Cognition and Development. She has\
  \ a lifelong fascination with the implications of evolutionary ideas on cognitive\

  \ better rear and educate children. She is the author of Your Brain on Childhood:\
  \ The Unexpected Side Effects of Classrooms, Ballparks, Family Rooms, and the Minivan\
  \ (Prometheus, 2011).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how memory develops in children\
  \ and how it works. We start with some basics about memory development. We Talk\
  \ about how we rewrite our memories every time we recall them, and memory sharing\
  \ and memory-sharing styles. We discuss the existence of repressed memories, and\
  \ how false memories can be engendered. We introduce a bit of an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ to try to understand why our memories fail in these domains. We also talk about\
  \ autobiographical memory and its relation with the \u201Cself\u201D. Finally, we\
  \ discuss some of the problems with eyewitness testimonies. \n\nTime Links:  \n\
