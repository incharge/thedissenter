shownotes: "Dr. Martin Schaefer is a former Professor of Evolutionary Biology and\
  \ Animal Ecology of the University of Freiburg, Germany. Now, he\u2019s leading\
  \ a conservation NGO, Fundaci\xF3n Jocotoco (www.fjocotoco.org), based in Ecuador.\
  \   \nIn this episode, we talk about the conservation of endangered species, what\
  \ biological aspects should be taken into consideration, and how to best canalize\
  \ our efforts and resources. We also talk a little bit about the work Dr. Schaefer\
  \ is doing at Fundaci\xF3n Jocotoco, in Ecuador. Topics include: the importance\
  \ of genetic diversity, and its interplay with climate change; range sizes; species\
  \ and environments that are more vulnerable to climate change; the risk coming from\
  \ new pathogens and parasites; respecting each species sociality; and aiming at\
  \ preserving biodiversity, and not particular species.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:31</time>\
