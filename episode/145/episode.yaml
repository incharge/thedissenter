  \nIn this episode, we talk about the relationship between evolutionary theory, philosophy,\
  \ ethics and politics. We refer to the role of philosophy in a scientific world;\
  \ the importance of selfishness and altruism in moral philosophy; evolutionary processes\
  \ like kin selection, reciprocal altruism and group selection; how our moral values\
  \ are influences by our personality and other innate proclivities; what is mora\
  \ important for societies; the is-ought dichotomy, and if the naturalistic fallacy\
  \ really exists; and also about the work of Friedrich Hayek, Karl Polanyi, and the\
  \ positive aspects and limitations of market liberal morality, both at the individual\
  \ and collective levels. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:32</time> How to apply evolutionary\
