We talk about the feelings of knowing, certainty, familiarity, clarity of thought, and déjà vu that we have. We also refer to phenomena like moral dumbfounding and post-hoc rationalization. We discuss the problem with our view of how reason and rationality work, and how we are mistaken about how our own thinking works. We also talk about how different people see the world in different ways, our individual differences, and how religiosity is not going away anytime soon. We refer to the placebo effect, and also to how scientists have to be careful about how their own intuitions might affect how they study the human mind. We end up by discussing a possible way to improve the way we think, through a process of cultural evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:07</time> Feelings of knowing and certainty  \n<time>04:54</time> Do we already know where are they located in the brain?  \n<time>09:54</time> A possible explanation for the evolution of these feelings  \n<time>13:08</time> The problem of how we talk about our minds  \n<time>15:07</time> Post-hoc rationalizations  \n<time>20:08</time> We don’t even understand how we think  \n<time>22:43</time> The problem with how we tend to think about reason and rationality  \n<time>28:48</time> We see the world in different ways  \n<time>38:02</time> The placebo effect  \n<time>41:42</time> Researchers also have to be careful about their own biases when studying the human mind  \n<time>47:56</time> A possible solution to changing the way we think  \n<time>54:32</time> Follow Dr. Burton’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Burton’s work:  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/2KXY88E  \nArticles on Aeon: http://bit.ly/2Z8wEqD  \nOther articles: http://bit.ly/2L2F1tS  \nOn Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not: https://amzn.to/2zguWEl  \nA Skeptic's Guide to the Mind: What Neuroscience Can and Cannot Tell Us About Ourselves: https://amzn.to/2L2F6ha\n",
