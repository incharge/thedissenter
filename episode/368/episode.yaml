excerpt: 'Dr. Ian Tattersall is currently curator emeritus in the Division of Anthropology
  of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He has carried out both
  primatological and paleontological fieldwork in countries as diverse as Madagascar,
  Vietnam, Surinam, Yemen, and Mauritius. Trained in archaeology and anthropology
  at the University of Cambridge, and in geology and vertebrate paleontology at Yale
  University, Dr. Tattersall has concentrated his research since the 1960s in three
  main areas: the analysis of the human fossil record and its integration with evolutionary
  theory, the origin of human cognition, and the study of the ecology and systematics
  of the lemurs of Madagascar. He is also a prominent interpreter of human paleontology
  to the public, with numerous trade books to his credit, as well as several articles
  in Scientific American and the co-editorship of the definitive Encyclopedia of Human
  Evolution and Prehistory. '

  \ \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the study of the human fossil record, and several\
  \ aspects of human evolution, with a focus on the genus Homo. We discuss how the\
  \ Pleistocene conditions might have affected human evolution; the role of culture;\
  \ and the cognitive revolution. We also refer to what is a modern human, and the\
  \ evolution of language and symbolism. Finally, we tackle narratives in the paleosciences,\
  \ like the one about human races and the relative importance of natural selection\
  \ in comparison with cultural selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:27</time> Studying\
