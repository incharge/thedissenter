shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 26th 2021.  \nDr. Christopher Kavanagh is an associate\
  \ professor in the College of Contemporary Psychology at Rikkyo University and a\
  \ researcher in cognitive anthropology at the Institute of Cognitive & Evolutionary\
  \ Anthropology (ICEA) at the University of Oxford. Currently he is based in Japan\
  \ where he conducts research in collaboration with Masaki Yuki\u2019s Culture, Social\
  \ Ecology, and Psychology Lab in Hokkaido University. His research interests include\
  \ East Asian religions, ritual behavior, and the bonding effects of shared dysphoria.\
  \ He is co-host of the Decoding the Gurus podcast.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ some topics in the cognitive science of religion, and WEIRD psychology. We start\
  \ by defining religion, and talk a bit about its evolutionary and cultural foundations.\
  \ We discuss how religion is practiced, and distinguish between orthopraxic and\
  \ orthodoxic religions. We mention modes theory, and the best ways of studying religious\
  \ rituals. We focus specifically on high-arousal rituals. We discuss minimally counterintuitive\
  \ ideas. We talk about how relational mobility can explain certain aspects of religion.\
  \ We address how people practice religion in Japan, and its supposed atheistic nature.\
  \ Finally, we discuss WEIRD psychology, and the problem with distinguishing between\
  \ individualist and collectivist societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
