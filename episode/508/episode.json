He is the author of Forgetting: The Benefits of Not Remembering.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Forgetting. We first talk about some of the basics of how memory works. We then talk about forgetting, bot its benefits, and conditions where it gets pathological, like Alzheimer’s. We also talk about PTDS and autism. Finally, we discuss if people should want to have better memories, and if it is possible to improve memory.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:47</time> How memory works  \n<time>14:44</time> Forgetting (and its benefits)  \n<time>30:27</time> Pathologies – PTSD, Alzheimer’s, autism  \n<time>44:30</time> Improving memory  \n<time>47:31</time> Follow Dr. Small’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Small’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/35SH7ra  \nColumbia University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center: https://bit.ly/363f9ci  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2UJlgjJ  \nForgetting: https://amzn.to/3vXmtAD\n\n",
