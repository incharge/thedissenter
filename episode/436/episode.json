  \nIn this episode, we focus on the two books: Just Deserts, and Rejecting Retributivism.\
  \ First, we give an overview of the philosophical positions on free will, with a\
  \ focus on incompatibilism, and we talk about luck. We discuss degrees of free will.\
  \ We then talk about the link between free will and morality; praise and blame;\
  \ if people need to believe in free will to be moral; how our legal and penal systems\
  \ work, and how they should change; if we need to punish wrongdoers. Finally, we\
  \ go through a lengthy discussion about how a new system could replace the penal\
  \ systems based on retributivism, and we ask if we should nudge people.\n\nTime\
