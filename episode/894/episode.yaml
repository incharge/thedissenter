  \ University of Murcia in Spain, where he leads the Minimal Intelligence Lab (MINT\
  \ Lab), focusing on the study of minimal cognition in plants. Dr. Calvo\u2019s interdisciplinary\
  \ work combines insights from biology, philosophy, and cognitive science to explore\
  \ the fascinating world of plant behavior, decision-making, and problem-solving.\
  \ By investigating the complex interactions and adaptive responses exhibited by\
  \ plants, Dr. Calvo has significantly contributed to our understanding of cognition\
  \ beyond the animal kingdom, challenging conventional perspectives on intelligence\
  \ and mental capacities. He is the author of Planta Sapiens: The New Science of\
  \ Plant Intelligence.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Planta Sapiens. We start by\
  \ discussing what intelligence means, and how to maintain some degree of skepticism\
  \ when it comes to comparing plants to animals. We talk about how plants behave,\
  \ cognitive behavior, how they learn, how they communicate, differences between\
  \ domesticated plants and wild plants, and plant biochemistry. We discuss whether\
  \ plants can have minds, and whether they can experience emotions, pain, and consciousness.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the potential ethical implications.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
