  \ with an interest in how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She\
  \ has a popular science blog \u2013 Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific\
  \ findings and literature relevant to her subject \u2013 more often than not with\
  \ an evolutionary-informed approach to understanding the subject matter. She has\
  \ held numerous lectures on the benefits of an evolutionary-informed approach to\
  \ understanding the cross-cultural sex and age differences in anti-social and criminal\
  \ behavior. \n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about using animal models to\
  \ study human violence, and Richard Wrangham\u2019s work on violence. We discuss\
  \ how much crime is impulsive and how much of it is planned. We talk about juvenile\
  \ crime, and the risk factors associated with it. We discuss how the media misrepresent\
  \ crime, and common misconceptions about the perpetrators. We talk about the link\
  \ between economic inequality and crime. Finally, we discuss common misconceptions\
  \ surrounding abortion.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:34</time>\
