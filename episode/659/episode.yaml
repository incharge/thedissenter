shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 11th 2022.  \nDr. Nick Chater is Professor of Behavioural\
  \ Science at Warwick Business School. He works on rationality and language using\
  \ a range of theoretical and experimental approaches. \n\nDr. Morten Christiansen\
  \ is William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychology\
  \ at Cornell University. His research focuses on the interaction of biological and\
  \ environmental constraints in the evolution, acquisition and processing of language.\n\
  \nThey are both authors of The Language Game: How Improvisation Created Language\
  \ and Changed the World.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Language Game. Topics\
  \ include: the importance of language; language as a game of charades; cognitive\
  \ mechanisms necessary for language; how languages evolved; linguistic communication\
  \ as a cooperation process; improvisation; how we keep up with and chunk language;\
  \ the meanings of words; Universal Grammar; why other species do not use language;\
  \ if language is in decline; improving children\u2019s language skills; if language\
  \ influences thought; and how language might shield us from the technological singularity.\n\
