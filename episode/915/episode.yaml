shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 6th 2023.  \nDr. Bernard Reginster is Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at Brown University. Dr. Reginster's research has focused mostly on issues in\
  \ ethics, metaethics, and moral psychology in 19th century German philosophy. His\
  \ new research interests include the topics of identity and intersubjectivity, for\
  \ which he considers ideas from psychoanalytic theory, 20th century Continental\
  \ philosophy, and contemporary Anglo-Saxon philosophy. He is the author of The Will\
  \ to Nothingness: An Essay on Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on The Will to Nothingness. We start by talking about the premise\
  \ of On the Genealogy of Morality, if Nietzsche\u2019s approach is naturalistic,\
  \ and what functionality means in the context of morality. We discuss how Nietzsche\
  \ understood the relationship between morality and affect, and the affect of ressentiment.\
  \ We talk about Christian morality as an act of revenge, master and slave morality,\
  \ where the ideas of \u201Cgood\u201D and \u201Cevil\u201D come from, and the role\
  \ of guilt and punishment. Finally, we discuss what the will to nothingness is.\
