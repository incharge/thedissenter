  \nIn this episode, we talk about the history of Mesopotamia. We first discuss what\
  \ Mesopotamia was, whether it was the first civilization, the development of writing,\
  \ linguistic and ethnic diversity in Mesopotamia, and trade relations and the role\
  \ of merchants. We then talk about Hammurabi\u2019s reign, the concept of \u201C\
  empire\u201D, Hammurabi\u2019s Code, whether violence was common in Mesopotamian\
  \ society, and gender relations and the role of women. We also talk about the Kingdom\
  \ of Hana, war and diplomacy in the Late Bronze Age, and the economy. Finally, we\
  \ discuss the legacy of Mesopotamia, and whether the Mesopotamians were that different\
  \ from us.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:04</time> What\
