shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 27th 2023.  \nDr. Caleb Everett is a Senior Associate\
  \ Dean in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Miami and a Professor\
  \ in the Anthropology Department, with a secondary appointment in Psychology. He\
  \ is a member of the inaugural class of Andrew Carnegie Fellows. His work explores\
  \ language, cognition and behavior across the world's cultures. His latest book\
  \ is A Myriad of Tongues: How Languages Reveal Differences in How We Think. \n\n\
  In this episode, we focus on A Myriad of Tongues. We discuss how sometimes people\
  \ assume too much universality in language, and where linguistic diversity stems\
  \ from. We explore how people talk about time, numbers, space and directions, social\
  \ relationships, and colors and odors. We discuss how the environment influences\
  \ the evolution of languages, focusing on the example of extreme ambient aridity,\
  \ and also whistled languages. We talk about the limitations of studying grammatical\
  \ patterns in idealized and written sentences. We discuss whether words are arbitrary,\
  \ and if we can accurately translate every word and expression. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and the broader study of universality and diversity\
  \ in human cognition.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time>\
