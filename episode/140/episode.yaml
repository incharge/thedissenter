  \ Companies.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about neuroeconomics, and the role that\
  \ oxytocin plays in attachment, and in promoting trust among people that are part\
  \ of the same organization or society. We go through how oxytocin evolved, and the\
  \ kinds of prosocial behavior that it mediates. We also refer to other hormones,\
  \ like testosterone and cortisol, and how they interact with oxytocin and might\
  \ change its behavioral effects. And, finally, we talk about how we can foster trust\
  \ in companies and other sorts of human organizations, reduce stress, increase productivity,\
  \ and empower employees.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:55</time> What is neuroeconomics?\
