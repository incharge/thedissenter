shownotes: "Dr. Michael Bang Petersen is Professor of Political Science at Aarhus\
  \ University, in Denmark. He also directs The Politics and Evolution Lab (PoNE Lab)\
  \ there. He investigates how the adaptive challenges of human evolutionary history\
  \ shape the way modern citizens think about mass politics. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about evolutionary political psychology. We discuss what is to be understood\
  \ as political behavior; the emotions, heuristics and biases that are more relevant\
  \ to understand people\u2019s political behavior (and also in other animals); the\
  \ deservingness heuristic; the biological bases of our progress from small-scale\
  \ hunter-gatherer societies to modern states, and the expansion of group identities;\
  \ the cues that lead people to support the welfare system more easily; intentionality;\
  \ how to tackle issues of political polarization; and also the benefits that politicians\
  \ can take from learning more about evolutionary psychology, and how human psychology\
  \ generally works.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:37</time> What is evolutionary political\
