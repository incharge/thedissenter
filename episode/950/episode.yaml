  \nThis show is sponsored by Enlites, Learning & Development done differently. Check\
  \ the website here: http://enlites.com/\n\nRECORDED ON NOVEMBER 27th 2023.  \nDr.\
  \ Zachary Garfield is Assistant Professor at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University\
  \ in the Faculty of Governance, Economics and Social Sciences, and co-director of\
  \ The Omo Valley Research Project. He investigates how behaviors such as leadership\
  \ and followership, social learning, decision-making, and economic strategies are\
  \ related to group-level pressures stemming from, for example, social contexts,\
  \ network dynamics, political structures, and cultural norms.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start by talking about leadership from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss\
  \ how to identify a leader, hypotheses for the evolution of leadership, whether\
  \ it is an evolved adaptation, how leadership works in small-scale egalitarian societies,\
  \ the social functions of leaders and their psychological traits, and how societies\
  \ transition to more inequality and how leaders become more coercive. We also talk\
  \ about the universal and variable dimensions of leadership across societies, and\
  \ differences between men and women leaders. We then discuss reputation and different\
  \ reputation domains in human societies, and the different ways people deal with\
  \ conflict resolution. Finally, we discuss whether leadership correlates with age.\n\
