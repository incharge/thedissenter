shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 1st 2022.  \nDr. James Zimring is Thomas W. Tillack\
  \ Professor of Experimental Pathology at the University of Virginia. He is the author\
  \ of What Science Is and How It Really Works (2019). His latest book is Partial\
  \ Truths: How Fractions Distort Our Thinking.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Partial\
  \ Truths. We start with the premise of the book, and explain what a fraction is.\
  \ We go through some biases and heuristics, like the confirmation bias and the availability\
  \ heuristic, and talk about their evolution. We discuss bias within the criminal\
  \ justice system. We talk about finding patterns where they do not exist, as in\
  \ conspiracy theories and prophecies. We discuss why the Universe appears to be\
  \ designed. We talk about bad uses of statistics in science. We discuss social cognition,\
  \ and an interactionist model of human reasoning, as opposed to an intellectualist\
  \ one. Finally, we ask if it would really be good to overcome errors of reasoning.\n\
