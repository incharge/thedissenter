	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 31st 2024.  \nDr. Mauro Silva J\u00fanior is Professor in the Department of Basic Psychological Processes at the Psychology Institute at the University of Brasilia. He works on interpersonal relationships, especially the traits of individuals and their social partners \u2013 such as sex differences, differences between parents and friends, and the use of technology as a mediator of social interactions. Moreover, he investigates the cognitive and memory aspects of the relationships with maternal and paternal parents, and friends; as well as levels of emotional and time investment.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of interpersonal relationships. We go through the main factors that play a role in parent-offspring relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. We talk about the role of personality in interpersonal relationships. We discuss what explains homosexuality in humans. We get into the role of sociosexuality in romantic relationships, how it relates to mating strategies, and how its risk-taking aspect played out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we talk about mating systems in human societies: monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry, and we discuss whether polyamory is a distinct mating system.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:06</time> The evolutionary psychology of interpersonal relationships  \n<time>04:37</time> Parent-offspring relationships  \n<time>14:03</time> Friendships  \n<time>20:11</time> Romantic relationships  \n<time>25:04</time> The role of personality in interpersonal relationships  \n<time>32:06</time> What explains homosexuality in humans?  \n<time>41:58</time> The role of sociosexuality in romantic relationships  \n<time>52:50</time> Sociosexuality and mating strategies  \n<time>55:47</time> Sociosexuality and risk-taking during the COVID-19 pandemic  \n<time>1:03:55</time> Mating systems in human societies: monogamy, polygyny, and polyandry  \n<time>1:12:55</time> Is polyamory a distinct mating system?  \n<time>1:18:06</time> Follow Dr. Silva J\u00fanior\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Silva J\u00fanior\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page (in Portuguese): https://bit.ly/3p46GTg  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/433Uukm  \nTwitter handle: @M_SilvaJunior\n",
