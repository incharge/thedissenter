shownotes: "Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in how\
  \ nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science blog\
  \ \u2013 Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature\

  \ approach to understanding the subject matter. She has held numerous lectures on\
  \ the benefits of an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the cross-cultural\
  \ sex and age differences in anti-social and criminal behavior. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about criminal behavior from an evolutionary perspective. We first get\
  \ into some of the basics of evolutionary theory that help explain criminal behavior.\
  \ We talk about cross-cultural evidence about criminal behavior, and more specifically\
  \ homicide, and also about some of the complications that arise from differences\
  \ in how countries collect data. We discuss the importance of distinguishing between\
  \ different categories of homicide. We talk a lot about the Scandinavian countries\
  \ during the interview, particularly how gender equality might influence rates of\
  \ intimate partner violence and homicide, and the gender equality paradox. We explore\
  \ sex differences in criminal behavior. We discuss filicide and neonaticide, and\
  \ why there are differences between biological parents and stepparents. We also\
  \ tackle suicidal behavior. Finally, we discuss ways of preventing homicide, and\
  \ also why it is so hard to communicate evolutionarily-informed science to the general\
  \ public.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:34</time> An evolutionary\
