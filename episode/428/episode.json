Dr. Fish presents his thesis against the idea that free speech exists, and we discuss its details. We start with a bit of Dr. Fish’s background and where his interest in free speech comes from, and also a definition of free speech. We talk about John Stuart Mill’s position, and the history of the political struggle for free speech. We discuss freedom of speech in the context of academia and the media. We ask if it makes sense to distinguish speech from action, and also address the distinction between freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry. Toward the end, Dr. Fish explains why he thinks “philosophy does not matter”.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> Dr. Fish’s background, and his interest in free speech  \n<time>04:13</time> What is free speech?  \n<time>09:34</time> John Stuart Mill’s position  \n<time>13:13</time> The history of free speech  \n<time>19:02</time> Free speech in academia  \n<time>25:52</time> Speech and action  \n<time>31:35</time> Freedom of inquiry  \n<time>39:35</time> Philosophy doesn’t matter\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Fish’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/37WEarh  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3pDIjXp  \nThere's No Such Thing As Free Speech: http://amzn.to/34VItRY  \nThe First: http://amzn.to/3rGA1jl\n",
