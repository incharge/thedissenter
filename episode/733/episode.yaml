  \ We cover some of the main events in the history of the Earth, including: its formation;\
  \ the formation of its atmosphere; where water came from; plate tectonics; the origins\
  \ of life; the rise of oxygen; evolution, from the first unicellular organisms to\
  \ animals; the colonization of land by plants and animals; the mass extinctions;\
  \ and the evolution of H. sapiens, and its ecological impact. Finally, we talk about\
  \ the future of the Earth.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time>\
