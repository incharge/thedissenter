shownotes: "Dr. Azim Shariff is Associate Professor and Canada Research Chair at the\
  \ University of British Columbia, Canada. He is a social psychologist whose research\
  \ focuses on where morality intersects with religion, cultural attitudes and economics.\
  \ Another rapidly expanding part of his research looks at human-technology interactions\
  \ and the ethics of automation, including self-driving cars.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the science of religion, and the ethics of self-driving cars. First,\
  \ we refer to the role that the science of religion plays in the integration of\
  \ the Humanities and the Sciences. Then, we address the prosocial and moral aspects\
  \ of religion, starting with the role that Big Gods played in allowing for cohesion\
  \ in large societies, and also the traits that work better in them. Also, why it\
  \ is more difficult to explain religious misbelief than religious thinking. Finally,\
  \ we discuss the ethics of self-driving cars, what people prefer to be their decisions,\
  \ and what the future might hold for this technology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:44</time>\
