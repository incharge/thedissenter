excerpt: Dr. Derek Leben is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of
  Pittsburgh, Johnstown. He works at the intersection of ethics, cognitive science,
  and emerging technologies. In his new book, Ethics for Robots, Dr. Leben argues
  for the use of a particular moral framework for designing autonomous systems based
  on the Contractarianism of John Rawls. He also demonstrates how this framework can
  be productively applied to autonomous vehicles, medical technologies, and weapons
  systems.

shownotes: "Dr. Derek Leben is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University\
  \ of Pittsburgh, Johnstown. He works at the intersection of ethics, cognitive science,\
  \ and emerging technologies. In his new book, Ethics for Robots, Dr. Leben argues\
  \ for the use of a particular moral framework for designing autonomous systems based\
  \ on the Contractarianism of John Rawls. He also demonstrates how this framework\
  \ can be productively applied to autonomous vehicles, medical technologies, and\
  \ weapons systems.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Leben\u2019\
  s Ethics for Robots. We first discuss the types of robots that need to have ethical\
  \ systems programmed into them. Then, we get into the issue of how to establish\
  \ an objective moral system. Dr. Leben explains Contractarianism ethics. We also\
  \ go over some specific technologies, like self-driving cars, carebots, police-bots,\
  \ and others, and we refer to specific issues like discrimination and consent. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the role of science fiction in providing us with thought experiments\
  \ about emergent and future technology, and to what extent that has a positive or\
  \ a negative effect.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:49</time> The types of robots that\
