  \ on \u201CCatastrophe!\u201D. We talk about the cognitive biases that people have\
  \ during emergencies. We get into topics like trends in suicide rates and blaming\
  \ social media for it, views on relationships between races in the US. We discuss\
  \ if the idea of the \u201Cmadness of crowds\u201D is useful, and availability cascades\
  \ and social contagion. We talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic became another culture\
  \ war. We also get into terrorism statistics and how people overreact to it, and\
  \ the causes of violence and its link to mental disorder. We discuss why it is so\
  \ hard to tackle climate change. Finally, we talk about how we can manage crises\
  \ better. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:38</time> How\
