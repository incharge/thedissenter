shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 28th 2023.  \nDr. Onurcan Yilmaz is an Associate\
  \ Professor of Psychology at Kadir Has University, Istanbul, and he currently leads\
  \ the Moral Intuitions Laboratory (MINT Lab). He studies the intersection between\
  \ morality, religion, politics and decision-making from perspectives derived from\
  \ cognitive and evolutionary psychology and behavioral economics. His research mainly\
  \ focuses on dual-process accounts of moral judgment and behavior.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about cognitive styles, politics, morality, and religion. We start by\
  \ talking about cognitive styles, and then go through several different links: between\
  \ cognitive style and political ideology; between analytic thinking and moral foundations;\
  \ between analytic thinking and economic conservatism; between cognitive style and\
  \ religiosity; between personality traits and political convictions; between morality\
  \ and politics; and between morality and religion. We talk about analytic thinking\
  \ training. We discuss if science can increase moral sensitivity, and if belief\
  \ in God can be induced in non-believers. We talk about the relationship between\
  \ cognitive style and normative views, and how psychopathy is related to utilitarianism.\
  \ Finally, we discuss if people have fixed normative principles.\n\nTime Links:\
