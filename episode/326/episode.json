shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 19th, 2020.  \nDr. Cristine Legare is a professor\
  \ of psychology and the director of the Evolution, Variation, and Ontogeny of Learning\
  \ Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. Her research examines how the\
  \ human mind enables us to learn, create, and transmit culture. She conducts comparisons\
  \ across age, culture, and species to address fundamental questions about cognitive\
  \ and cultural evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk about the phylogenetic\
  \ and ontogenetic bases of culture. We also refer to the cognitive bases of culture.\
  \ We ask if isolated individuals would ever develop culture. We discuss how children\
  \ acquire culture; core knowledge, and how it varies across societies; causal learning;\
  \ imitation; and natural and supernatural explanatory frameworks. We then address\
  \ what renders it so difficult for people to accept and understand evolution by\
  \ natural selection.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:46</time> Studying culture from\
