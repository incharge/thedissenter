You can watch the first one, on The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs, here: https://youtu.be/v13m30R_xbY\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Why Delusions Matter. We start by defining delusions, and the criteria used to classify them. We discuss if there are different types of delusions, and if the term “delusion” is problematic. We talk about what we learn about human cognition by studying delusions, the epistemic needs they fulfill, personal identity, their social component, and their costs and benefits to speakers and interpreters. We discuss how delusions exemplify the strengths of human cognition, and implications for social and political epistemology. Finally, we talk about creating better epistemic environments, and the issue of epistemic responsibility.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time> What are delusions?  \n<time>11:55</time> Why is it that some unusual beliefs are considered delusions and others aren’t?  \n<time>17:12</time> Being false or badly supported by the evidence  \n<time>22:03</time> Different types of delusions?  \n<time>24:17</time> Is the term “delusion” problematic?  \n<time>28:26</time> Why do delusions matter?  \n<time>35:16</time> The needs delusions fulfill  \n<time>40:52</time> Personal identity  \n<time>46:38</time> Are delusions a social phenomenon?  \n<time>53:36</time> Costs and benefits for speakers and interpreters  \n<time>58:44</time> How delusions exemplify the strengths of human cognition  \n<time>1:02:15</time> Implications for social and political epistemology  \n<time>1:05:30</time> Creating better epistemic environments  \n<time>1:11:01</time> Epistemic responsibility: individual or societal?  \n<time>1:17:12</time> Follow Dr. Bortolotti’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Bortolotti’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3lDjPvz  \nWebsite/blog: https://bit.ly/2Hejl0c  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3f8xs3B  \nWhy Delusions Matter: https://bit.ly/3rm0WVE  \nTwitter handle: @lisabortolotti\n",
