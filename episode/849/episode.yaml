  \ Group Leader (\u201CTools and Culture among Early Hominins\u201D) in the Department\
  \ of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of T\xFCbingen. In\
  \ addition, he is an adjunct scientist at the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study\
  \ and Conservation of Apes. His main research triangulates what (if anything) makes\
  \ human cognition unique - as well as why (and relatedly, when this happened and\
  \ how often). In particular, he uses various methods and pathways to study the factors\
  \ and the prehistorical beginnings that enabled the typical modern human \"variant\
  \ of culture\": cumulative culture of know-how.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ ape culture. We start by defining it, and discuss if it is similar or different\
  \ to human culture. We talk about studies done in captivity versus the ones done\
  \ in the wild. We discuss the differences between ape culture and human culture,\
  \ and focus on supra-individual know-how. We discuss what we can learn from these\
  \ questions. We talk about the \u201Csimilarity hypothesis\", and why is it important\
  \ to study unenculturated and untrained apes. We discuss the work of Cecilia Heyes\
  \ and its potential implications for the study of culture. We talk about tasks commonly\
  \ used to study ape social learning, and what we can learn from them. Finally, we\
  \ discuss if we know where the differences in the cultures between humans and apes\
  \ come from.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> What\
