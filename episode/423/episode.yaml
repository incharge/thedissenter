  economics. Topics include collective action and public goods, generosity and redistribution,
  voting and political mobilization, partisanship, risk and time preferences, and
  emotions such as anger, compassion, and shame. Methods include behavioral economic
  games, population-based surveys, decision making tasks, implicit social cognition
  measures, game theoretic analysis, agent-based simulations, and cross-cultural data

  \ in the Department of Political Science and the Center for Behavioral Political\
  \ Economy at Stony Brook University. His research is at the intersection of political\
  \ science, evolutionary psychology, and behavioral economics. Topics include collective\
  \ action and public goods, generosity and redistribution, voting and political mobilization,\
  \ partisanship, risk and time preferences, and emotions such as anger, compassion,\
  \ and shame. Methods include behavioral economic games, population-based surveys,\
  \ decision making tasks, implicit social cognition measures, game theoretic analysis,\
  \ agent-based simulations, and cross-cultural data collection.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about political science through an evolutionary lens. We go through topics\
  \ like welfare tradeoffs from an evolutionary perspective; the welfare state, and\
  \ when people are for and against it; the emotion of compassion, and the role it\
  \ plays in politics; free riding on public goods, and how people deal with free\
  \ riders; partisanship, and voting behavior; and economic redistribution. Toward\
  \ the end, we talk about the insights evolutionary psychology brings to political\
  \ science.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:52</time> Welfare tradeoffs, compassion, and\
