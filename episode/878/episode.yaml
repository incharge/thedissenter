  \nIn this episode, we talk about the epistemology of science. We first get into\
  \ epistemic attitudes, epistemic tolerance and authoritarianism, skepticism towards\
  \ the scientific method, whether epistemic attitudes relate to politics, and whether\
  \ the political views of scientists play a major role in their scientific decisions.\
  \ We talk about scientific performance, epistemic efficiency, machine learning in\
  \ grant reviews, and research funding. We discuss team structures, and optimal research\
  \ team composition in science. We talk about the decision to stop investing in particular\
  \ scientific projects. We discuss methods to study the social epistemology of science.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the costs associated with trying to reduce all scientific\
  \ production and communication to English, epistemic equity, and dissatisfaction\
  \ of female and early-career researchers with the academic system.\n\n\nTime Links:\
