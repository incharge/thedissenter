  \ Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start off by talking a bit about Dr. Buss\u2019 background, and what led him\
  \ to Evolutionary Psychology. Then, we get into his research on human mating, from\
  \ the conceptual foundations to universal sex differences in mate preferences, and\
  \ mate retention tactics. We also discuss how modern technology might be tweaking\
  \ our brains into preferring short-term mating strategies, namely with things like\
  \ dating websites and online pornography. And we finish with some current work he\u2019\
  s doing on sexual morality, and if all of this knowledge can help couples with their\
  \ intimate relationships.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:51</time> How Dr. Buss got\
