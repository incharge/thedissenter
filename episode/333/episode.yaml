  \ of Human Origins at the Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology at\
  \ the Columbian College of Arts & Sciences at George Washington University. He is\
  \ a medically trained paleoanthropologist. His research interests are all related\
  \ in one way or another to a long-standing pre-occupation with hominin systematics.\
  \ How can we improve our ability to recognize species in the fossil record, and\
  \ how can we do a better job of reconstructing their phylogenetic relationships?\
  \ His current research interests are phylogeny reconstruction, hominin systematics,\
  \ dental evolution, evolvability within the hominin clade, and diet reconstruction.\
  \ He\u2019s the author of several books, including Human Evolution: A Very Short\
  \ Introduction, and Human Evolution: A Guide to Fossil Evidence.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about paleoanthropology, and the field of human systematics. We talk about\
  \ the hominin clade and the genus Homo, and how we distinguish between different\
  \ species. We discuss some of the main challenges in reconstructing human evolution.\
  \ And we also touch on topics such as hominin migrations, the relationship between\
  \ H. sapiens and the Neanderthals, and the limitations in studying ancient behavior.\n\
