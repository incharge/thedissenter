  \ professor at the department of philosophy at Johannes Gutenberg University of\
  \ Mainz, Germany. From 2014-2019 he was a Fellow at the Gutenberg Research College.\
  \ He is the founder and director of the MIND group and Adjunct Fellow at the Frankfurt\
  \ Institute of Advanced Studies, Germany. His research centers on analytic philosophy\
  \ of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, and AI. We start with consciousness,\
  \ and ask what is the best way of approaching the study of consciousness, and discuss\
  \ pure consciousness, and the minimal model of explanation for consciousness. We\
  \ also talk about what we can learn from disruptions of consciousness, and if other\
  \ animals also have consciousness. We talk about panpsychism and solipsism. We discuss\
  \ the self-model theory of subjectivity, and the \u201Cself\u201D. Finally, we discuss\
  \ the some of the most pressing issues in the ethics of AI, and artificial consciousness.\n\
