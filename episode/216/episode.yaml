  \ for how humans came to be. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about cultural evolution.\
  \ First, we discuss how we study the cognitive mechanisms that provide a biological\
  \ basis for culture, and the relationship between biology and culture. We then get\
  \ into Dr. Morgan\u2019s work on conformist transmission, and sex differences in\
  \ conformity and where they stem from. We also talk about the chicken-and-egg problem\
  \ of culture, and issues with sociocultural constructionist approaches, and cross-cultural\
  \ variation. Finally, we discuss what we can learn by studying other species, and\
  \ about how peculiar is cumulative culture in the animal realm. \n\nTime Links:\
