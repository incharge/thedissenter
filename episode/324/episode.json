He is also the founder of Maní+, an award-winning social enterprise in Guatemala that develops and produces locally sourced foods to fight malnutrition. Dr. Fischer advises the WHO-Europe on the cultural contexts of health, and serves on the board of the Maya Education Foundation.

Dr. Fischer is currently working on a project that examines the ways moral and economic values are intertwined in the high-end coffee market.\n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly on the anthropology of wellbeing, also known as positive anthropology, as developed by Dr. Fischer. Before tackling the topic, we talk about the different branches of anthropology in the US. We then get into questions regarding the good life, values, stated and revealed preferences, and meta-preferences. We also mention how the market allows for the expression of values. Finally, we talk about Dr. Fischer’s work on the Maya culture in Guatemala, their values, and in what ways they connect with coffee production.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:41</time> The different branches of anthropology  \n<time>08:03</time> The anthropology of wellbeing  \n<time>10:33</time> What is a good life?  \n<time>14:24</time> About human universals  \n<time>18:17</time> What are values?  \n<time>22:22</time> Stated and revealed preferences, and the self  \n<time>31:27</time> Meta-preferences  \n<time>33:38</time> Do values have a biological basis?  \n<time>39:34</time> Aspiration and opportunity, dignity and fairness, commitment to a larger purpose.  \n<time>41:23</time> How does the market allow for the expression of values?  \n<time>45:21</time> Maya culture in Guatemala, their values, and in what ways they connect with coffee production  \n<time>50:36</time> A global network of cultures  \n<time>53:29</time> Follow Dr. Fischer’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Fischer’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2qXQVzm  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/31PhRPM  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/35o8nvZ  \nThe Great Courses profile: http://bit.ly/2SmvL95  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/38qOQfK  \nThe Good Life: Aspiration, Dignity, and the Anthropology of Wellbeing: https://amzn.to/2HizQos\n",
