First, we define morality, and talk about the concept of the “evolved nest”. We ask if morality is innate, and discuss moral foundations theory and its limitations. We get into moral development, and talk about the role of genetics, the parents, and the wider community. We talk about multiples inheritances genes, epigenetics, developmental plasticity, basic needs, the microbiome, local and macro ecological heritages). We mention the importance of social interaction in child development. We discuss human flourishing, and what we can learn from indigenous societies. Finally, we talk about studying human behavior through a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:09</time> What is morality?  \n<time>04:56</time> The evolved nest  \n<time>13:52</time> Is morality innate?  \n<time>19:29</time> Moral foundations theory  \n<time>25:49</time> Moral development  \n<time>29:48</time> Behavioral genetics   \n<time>37:05</time> Multiple inheritances  \n<time>48:04</time> Human flourishing, and what we can learn from indigenous societies  \n<time>53:08</time> A multidisciplinary approach  \n<time>54:57</time> Follow Dr. Narvaez’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Narvaez’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3awIU93  \nThe Evolved Nest: http://bit.ly/3qhVmyf  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/2Z749XW  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3pcGaBd  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2OzLGkZ  \nNeurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: https://amzn.to/2MXyKVr  \nTwitter handle: @MoralLandscapes\n",
