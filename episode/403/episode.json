  \ Professor of Philosophy at the College of William & Mary. His research interests\

  \ we focus on Why It\u2019s OK to Ignore Politics. In the first part of the interview,\
  \ we discuss voting behavior (why people decide to vote, and to abstain from voting);\
  \ how difficult it is for people to have enough knowledge to make good political\
  \ decisions (including politicians and scientific experts); politically motivated\
  \ thinking; the social costs of political participation; and local politics. We\
  \ address some challenges to Dr. Freiman\u2019s position. Toward the end, we talk\
  \ about the therapeutic benefits of ignoring politics, libertarianism, and effective\
  \ altruism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:04</time> Voting behavior  \n<time>05:51</time>\
