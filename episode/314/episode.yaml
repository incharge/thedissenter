shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 14th, 2020.  \nDr. Zanna Clay is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at Durham University. She is a comparative and\
  \ developmental psychologist with expertise in primatology. She studies and compares\
  \ great apes and young children in order to investigate the evolutionary and developmental\
  \ basis of hominid social cognition and behavior. Her main interests are the development\
  \ & evolution of social cognition and communication, focusing on empathy, language\
  \ and social learning.\n\nIn this episode, We focus mostly on bonobo societies and\
  \ their behavior. We talk first about their sociality. Then we go through the different\
  \ types of calls that they have, related to food, alarm calls, and sex. We also\
  \ ask how far back in evolution do vocalizations go, and the cognitive tools needed\
  \ to produce them, and also about a possible phylogenetic relationship between animal\
  \ vocalizations and human language. We explore the social functions of sex in bonobo\
  \ societies. We also discuss socio-emotional competence in bonobos, and how we can\
  \ compare their development with the one of human infants. Finally, we address the\
  \ question if there is a best primate (great Ape) model to compare to humans.\n\n\
