shownotes: "Dr. James Cresswell is Professor of Psychology at Ambrose University,\
  \ Adjunct Professor at the University of Calgary, Research Associate at the Canadian\
  \ Poverty Institute, and Research Associate at the Newcomer Research Network. Dr.\
  \ Cresswell has a deep commitment to education and to enhancing the student experience.\
  \  His courses cover topics such as culture, immigration, and identities in an increasingly\

  \ Other teaching areas are child psychology and human development. His research\
  \ interests draw on many sources, ranging from cultural psychology to cognitive\
  \ science and literary theory.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about theoretical psychology.\
  \ We start by discussing what a theory is, and whether data themselves can yield\
  \ theories. We talk about the notion of \u201Cmyth\u201D. We discuss where we derive\
  \ our philosophical/ontological conditions for truth from, and why it is so hard\
  \ for psychologists to look critically at their own theories. We talk about different\
  \ uses of theory, and what makes for a falsifiable claim. We discuss the similarities\
  \ between theories and myths. We talk about theorizing, and what it is like to be\
  \ both an insider and an outsider in a particular field. Finally, we discuss how\
  \ to think about the replication crisis, and the \u201Cinclusion crisis\u201D.\n\
