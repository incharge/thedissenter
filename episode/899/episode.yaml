  \ Dr. Narvaez\u2019 research explores questions of species-typical and species-atypical\
  \ development in terms of wellbeing, morality, and sustainable wisdom. She examines\
  \ how early life experience (the evolved nest) influences moral functioning and\
  \ wellbeing.   \nDr. Gay A. Bradshaw is a psychologist and ecologist, and director\
  \ of The Kerulos Center for Nonviolence. Her work focuses on animal trauma recovery\
  \ and wildlife self-determination. She is the author of Elephants on the Edge: What\
  \ Animals Teach Us about Humanity, an award-winning book on PTSD in elephants. \
  \ \nThey are both authors of The Evolved Nest: Nature's Way of Raising Children\
  \ and Creating Connected Communities.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Evolved\
  \ Nest. We start by discussing what an \u201Cevolved nest\u201D is. We talk about\
  \ mothers and allomothers; the importance of physical contact; the role of elders\
  \ and fathers; attachment theory; children\u2019s needs; and the impact of early\
  \ life experiences. We discuss the effects of individualistic values in modern industrialized\
  \ societies. Finally, we talk about what we can learn from traditional societies\
  \ and non-human animals.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:40  What is an \u201C\
