  \ at Corpus Christi College, University of Cambridge, and an Associate Fellow at\
  \ the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI). He works mostly in\
  \ the philosophy of mind and psychology. His primary research interest at the moment\
  \ is on how various forms of irrationality and bias are socially adaptive, enabling\
  \ individuals to achieve social goals that are in conflict with epistemic goals.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about beliefs, rationalization markets, misinformation,\
  \ and motivated cognition. We start with beliefs: what they are, where they stem\
  \ from, and why we hold them. We discuss the social functions of beliefs, and get\
  \ into socially adaptive beliefs, and their relationship with confabulation, rationalization,\
  \ positive illusions, and identity-protective cognition. We talk about rationalization\
  \ markets, politics, and understanding misinformation. Finally, we discuss absurd\
  \ beliefs, irrationality, and motivated cognition, with a focus on motivated ignorance.\
