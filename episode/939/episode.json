His research has centered on a range of subjects concerning human evolution, including the evolution of cognition, the evolution of behavior, and the relations between climate change and hominin dispersals.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about what we know prior to the speciation of Homo sapiens. We discuss whether H. sapiens arose in one single location in Africa or multiple locations, the environments we have evolved in, and migrations within Africa. We talk about technological changes, symbolism, and sociality in H. sapiens, what we know about out-of-Africa migrations, and issues with hypotheses based on coastal movements. We also talk about the effects of climate change on human dispersals, the hominin species we interacted and interbred with, and the biggest missing pieces in the history of human dispersals. Finally, we discuss whether lessons of the past can tell us anything about humanity today.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:50</time> What we know prior to the speciation of Homo sapiens  \n<time>04:50</time> Did H. sapiens appear in one single location in Africa, or multiple locations?  \n<time>14:51</time> The environments we’ve evolved in  \n<time>17:24</time> Migrations within Africa  \n<time>20:20</time> Technological changes, symbolism, and sociality in H. sapiens  \n<time>26:32</time> What we know about out-of-Africa migrations, and issues with coastal movements  \n<time>43:05</time> The effects of climate change on human dispersals  \n<time>47:10</time> Hominin species we interacted and interbred with  \n<time>52:45</time> Biggest missing pieces in the history of human dispersals  \n<time>58:31</time> Do lessons of the past tell us anything about humanity today?  \n<time>1:03:40</time> Follow Dr. Petraglia’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Petraglia’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3RstWWl  \nAustralian Research Centre for Human Evolution: https://bit.ly/3RtCzA3  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3nTwwGT  \nHuman Dispersal and Species Movement: https://bit.ly/39fxcNY  \nTwitter handle: @MDPetraglia\n",
