  \ on A Theory of Everyone. We begin with the premise of the book, and what a \u201C\
  theory of everyone\u201D is. We talk about four laws of life: energy, innovation,\
  \ cooperation, and evolution. We discuss how cooperation expands in human societies,\
  \ and what distinguishes us from other animals. We talk about intelligence and IQ,\
  \ and the collective brain and the idea of \u201Cgenius\u201D. We discuss the importance\
  \ of institutions and cultural norms, and the role of ideas. We talk about multiculturalism,\
  \ and how to solve the \u201Cparadox of diversity\u201D. We discuss our current\
  \ energy ceiling, and the problems that derive from it and how to solve them. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the challenges of studying human behavior cross-culturally.\n\n\
