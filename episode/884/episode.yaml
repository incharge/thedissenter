  Psychology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and group

  studying the influence of observation-based social learning contexts on object-related

shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 10th 2023.  \nDr. Maleen Thiele is a Postdoc in\
  \ the Department of Comparative Cultural Psychology at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Evolutionary Anthropology, and group leader of the Minerva Fasttrack Group\
  \ there. She is a developmental psychologist and infancy researcher interested in\
  \ the psychological foundations of early social learning. In her current postdoc\
  \ project, Dr. Thiele takes a comparative perspective studying the influence of\
  \ observation-based social learning contexts on object-related memory across great\
  \ ape species. A central methodological aim of the project is to develop robust\
  \ eye-tracking paradigms and reproducible data processing approaches helping us\
  \ to study ape cognition across species from infancy to adulthood.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about social learning in infants. We start by discussing how early in\
  \ development we can study social learning, and how it can be studied in preverbal\
  \ infants, including eye tracking. We talk about the importance of gaze following,\
  \ and how it emerges. We discuss how infants pay attention to third party interactions,\
  \ the role motivations play in what they pay attention to, and if these motivations\
  \ are also shaped by social learning. We also discuss whether infants\u2019 preference\
  \ for social interactions increases with age. We talk about the role of eye contact\
  \ in learning about objects. Finally, we talk about pedagogical forms of social\
  \ learning.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:39</time> How\
