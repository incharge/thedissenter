excerpt: Dr. Alecia Carter is Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology
  at University College London. Her current research investigates (1) how primates
  respond to the deaths of others and what this can tell us about the evolution of
  cognition and emotion and (2) how individuals access information to make decisions.
  In particular, she studies how individuals use their social environment to access
  information, and how their phenotype, their individual characteristics, may limit
  their use of that information. Her previous research addressed how and why animals'
  behavior varies from others but is consistent through time.

shownotes: "Dr. Alecia Carter is Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology\
  \ at University College London. Her current research investigates (1) how primates\
  \ respond to the deaths of others and what this can tell us about the evolution\
  \ of cognition and emotion and (2) how individuals access information to make decisions.\

  \ behavior varies from others but is consistent through time.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about thanatology, animal personality, and culture. We talk about what\
  \ thanatology is, and go through some of the ways baboons react to infants\u2019\
  \ corpses, with a focus on carrying behaviors. We discuss issues related to anthropomorphism\
  \ and biological continuity. We then talk about conceptual and methodological challenges\
  \ in the study of animal personality; studying personality in the wild versus the\
  \ lab; and comparing personality across species. We discuss how social learning\
  \ is studied in behavioral ecology, and we talk about culture, social transmission\
  \ of information, and innovation. Finally, we discuss Dr. Carter\u2019s work on\
  \ women\u2019s visibility in academic seminars.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
