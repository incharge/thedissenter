shownotes: "Dr. Stephen Hicks teaches at Rockford University, where he also directs\
  \ the Center for Ethics and Entrepreneurship. He is the author of books like Explaining\
  \ Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, and Nietzsche\
  \ and the Nazis. Additionally, he has published articles and essays on a range of\
  \ subjects, including entrepreneurism, free speech in academia, the history and\
  \ development of modern art, Ayn Rand's Objectivism, business ethics and the philosophy\
  \ of education, including a series of YouTube lectures.\n\nDr. Hicks is a return\
  \ guest on the show. Please go check out our first conversation, \u201CPostmodernism:\
  \ From Rousseau to the Present\u201D: https://youtu.be/rBTPMBKCZLs\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy, and some of Dr. Hicks\u2019 views about\
  \ it, as exposed in his book, \u201CNietzsche and the Nazis\u201D. As the title\
  \ of the book implies, we talk about how Nietzsche might have influenced the German\
  \ National-Socialist political ideology, and, toward the end, we also get a little\
  \ bit into the connections between Nazism and Postmodernism, and how Nietzsche was\
  \ one of the major influences in both these political opposite ideologies. Specific\
  \ topics include Nietzsche\u2019s reactionary views against the values of the Enlightenment,\
  \ namely rationality and objectivity, individualism, progress, and science as whole.\n\
