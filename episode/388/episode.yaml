  \ Lee Edwards Travis Research Institute and Professor of Psychology in the Department\
  \ of Doctoral Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. Currently, he is most actively\
  \ involved in neuroscience research in two areas: (1) the cognitive and psychosocial\

  \ Nature Review Neuroscience, and Science; 15 chapters in edited scholarly books;\
  \ and over 150 presentations at scientific meetings.\n\nIn this episode, we tackle\
  \ some major theoretical questions in neuroscience. We discuss mind-brain dualism,\
  \ reductionism and emergentism, embodied cognition, causality, and determinism and\
  \ free will. We also talk about Dr. Brown\u2019s research on the agenesis of the\
  \ corpus calossum, the neuroscience of religion, and the relationship between science\
  \ and religion.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:18</time> Mind-brain dualism  \n<time>03:58</time>\
