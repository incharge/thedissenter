She joined the Buss Lab after finishing her MA Degree at California State University, Fullerton in Spring 2021. In her Master's thesis, she sought to understand individual differences in rape myth acceptance. She is currently interested in sexual conflict and women's psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about rape myth acceptance, strategies against sexual exploitation, and the relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology. We start by discussing rape myth acceptance; some common rape myths; the Rape Excusing Attitudes and Language Scale; the reproductive self-interest model of morality (RSIMM) as a framework for understanding moral judgments associated with sexual behavior; individual differences in attitudes toward abortion, prostitution, and contraception; and what predicts rape myth acceptance. We then talk about female psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:57</time> What is rape myth acceptance?  \n<time>02:24</time> Common rape myths  \n<time>03:40</time> The Rape Excusing Attitudes and Language Scale  \n<time>08:26</time> The reproductive self-interest model of morality (RSIMM) as a framework for understanding moral judgments associated with sexual behavior  \n<time>11:25</time> Individual differences in attitudes toward abortion, prostitution, and contraception  \n<time>14:16</time> What predicts rape myth acceptance?  \n<time>22:15</time> Female psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation  \n<time>30:26</time> The relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology  \n<time>37:22</time> Follow Rebecka’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Rebecka’s work:  \nUniversity page: http://bit.ly/3kk1g3G  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3Xdigr6  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3XaXJU8  \nTwitter handle: @RandomMutations\n",
