Yampolskiy is a Tenured Associate Professor in the department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville. He is the founding and current director of the Cyber Security Lab and an author of many books including Artificial Superintelligence: a Futuristic Approach. Dr. Yampolskiy is a Senior member of IEEE and AGI; Member of Kentucky Academy of Science, and Research Advisor for MIRI and Associate of GCRI. Dr. Yampolskiy’s main areas of interest are AI Safety, Artificial Intelligence, Behavioral Biometrics, Cybersecurity, Digital Forensics, Games, Genetic Algorithms, and Pattern Recognition. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about artificial intelligence. We start by discussing what AI is, and how it compares to natural intelligence. We then go into some of the issues we have to worry about, like the ones related to security, controllability, and unexplainability of AI. We talk about the Singularity, the concept, and what it could be like. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> What is artificial intelligence?  \n<time>06:16</time> Minds, and consciousness  \n<time>09:42</time> Security, controllability, and unexplainability  \n<time>21:50</time> Human enhancement?  \n<time>24:09</time> The ethics of AI  \n<time>26:24</time> The Singularity  \n<time>31:30</time> Questions we have to think about   \n<time>44:26</time> Follow Dr. Yampolskiy’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Yampolskiy’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2MEKw6M  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3cncn5V  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2PtidJY  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3thgPtg  \nTwitter handle: @romanyam\n",
