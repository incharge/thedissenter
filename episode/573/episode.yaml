shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2021.  \nDr. Jennifer Sheehy-Skeffington is\
  \ Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and\
  \ Political Science. She is a social psychologist interested in the mechanisms underlying\
  \ our human sensitivity to power, status, and group membership: their origins, interactions,\
  \ and manifestation in societal context.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about evolutionary\
  \ and social psychology. We discuss if humans are a hierarchical species, and how\
  \ to understand power and status from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about\
  \ group identity, and how people form it. We get into social dominance orientation,\
  \ how it shapes our worldview, and is relationship with political ideology. We talk\
  \ about the effects of poverty on human psychology, and how people perceive social\
  \ inequality. We touch on the psychological effects of the 2008 economic crisis,\
  \ and the potential ones we can see from this pandemic. We wrap things up by discussing\
  \ how to integrate evolutionary and social psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
