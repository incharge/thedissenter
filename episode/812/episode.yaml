shownotes: "M\xE9lusine Boon-Falleur is a PhD student in cognitive sciences at the\
  \ \xC9cole Normale Sup\xE9rieure (ENS) Paris, researching how evolution shaped our\
  \ brain. She is particularly interested in studying how individuals adapt to the\
  \ amount of resources available in their environment, and how our social cognition\
  \ influences pro-environmental behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on how resources\
  \ impact psychology, and climate change. We start by talking about noncognitive\
  \ skills and their impact on academic achievement. We then get into how quantitative\
  \ changes in resources lead to qualitative changes in people\u2019s psychology.\
  \ We discuss the importance of time horizons, and talk about pyramids of needs.\
  \ We discuss how resource allocation affects cooperation and health-related behavior.\
  \ We discuss risky behaviors through different time horizons. We talk about where\
  \ stereotypes about the behavior of people of low socioeconomic status come from.\
  \ We talk about the belief-action gap and what explains it. We discuss the labeling\
  \ of behaviors as \u201Cirrational\u201D. Finally, we talk about the social dilemma\
  \ of climate change and the cognitive mechanisms that play a role in environmental\
  \ policies, and the important role of social scientists in helping tackle climate\
  \ change.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time> Noncognitive\
