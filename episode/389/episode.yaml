shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 8th 2020.  \nDr. Robert Atkinson is a Canadian-American\
  \ economist. He is president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation\
  \ (ITIF), a public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C., that promotes policies\
  \ based on innovation economics. He was previously Vice President of the Progressive\
  \ Policy Institute. He\u2019s the author of four books, including Big Is Beautiful:\
  \ Debunking the Myth of Small Business.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss Big is Beautiful.\
  \ We begin with the history of how the idea of small business being good, and big\
  \ business bad, developed. Then we talk about the impact that small businesses really\
  \ have in developing countries. We tackle income inequality, government subsidies\
  \ for new businesses, and how regulations are weaker for small businesses. We discuss\
  \ if small businesses really contribute that much to job creation, why have new\
  \ startups rates been falling, and the situation in Europe in general, and Portugal\
  \ in particular. Finally, we address how people feel about big business, supporting\
  \ local production, and technological unemployment. We end up with what would a\
  \ Big Business is Beautiful campaign would look like.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:43</time>\
