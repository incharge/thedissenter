Her research spans the areas of metametaphysics, the metaphysics of pregnancy, the epistemology of logic, and feminist and queer theory. She is the editor of 'Women of Ideas' published with Oxford University Press which is a selection of interviews with women from Philosophy Bites. She is an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy; she is on the Executive Committee for the Society for Women in Philosophy UK; she is on the Council for the Royal Institute of Philosophy; and she is a Union Committee member for RHUL UCU.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the epistemology of logic, the philosophy of love, and the metaphysics of pregnancy. We first discuss the epistemology of logic, and the relationship between logic and rationality. We then get into the philosophy of love, and talk about unconditional love, Bayesian probability theory, and games like poker. Finally, we discuss the metaphysics of pregnancy, and go through questions like if the fetus if a part of the mother, abortion, birth, and pregnancy-related technologies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:44</time> The epistemology of logic, and rationality  \n<time>03:16</time> The philosophy of love  \n<time>06:16</time> Does unconditional love exist?  \n<time>09:57</time> Understanding love using Bayesian probability theory  \n<time>15:01</time> Is love like poker?  \n<time>19:28</time> The metaphysics of pregnancy  \n<time>21:10</time> Is the fetus part of the mother?  \n<time>23:24</time> Abortion  \n<time>29:25</time> Birth  \n<time>31:17</time> The ethics of pregnancy  \n<time>35:29</time> Ectogenetive and ectogestative technologies  \n<time>39:51</time> Artificial womb technologies  \n<time>44:00</time> Follow Dr. Finn’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Finn’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3vThjY0  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3bmWA5C  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3CpZAKg  \nArticles on Aeon: https://bit.ly/3GBAxGS\n",
