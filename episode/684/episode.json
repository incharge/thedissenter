He is the author of Becoming God: Pure Reason in Early Greek Philosophy (Bloomsbury, 2012), and co-editor of Introductory Readings in Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy (Hackett, 2015).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Nietzsche and Plato. We start by talking about Nietzsche’s phases in his writings, and ask if The Will to Power should be considered canon. We discuss why we can compare Nietzsche and Plato. And then we get into some of the aspects of their philosophies, and where they diverge and converge, including: the Dionysian, the Apollonian, and the Greek poets; their metaphysics; the Eternal Return, and time as linear or circular; slave and master morality; Plato’s Republic, hierarchy, and democracy; and the differences between the Philosopher King and the Übermensch.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> Phases in Nietzsche’s career  \n<time>15:35</time> Is The Will to Power canon?  \n<time>18:39</time> Why compare Nietzsche and Plato?  \n<time>22:03</time> Nietzsche’s takes on Plato and Socrates  \n<time>30:21</time> The Dionysian, the Apollonian, and the Greek poets  \n<time>45:05</time> The metaphysics of Plato and Nietzsche  \n<time>47:56</time> The Eternal Return, and time as linear or circular  \n<time>1:17:24</time> Slave and master morality  \n<time>1:24:18</time> Plato’s Republic, hierarchy, and democracy  \n<time>1:48:45</time> The Philosopher King, and the Übermensch  \n<time>2:11:52</time> Follow Dr. Lee Miller’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lee Miller’s work:  \nOur first interview (Reason and Morality from Antiquity to Postmodernism): https://youtu.be/iYrueaQy-0s  \nOur second interview (The Philosophy of Black Mirror): https://youtu.be/xokhlikH74s  \nFaculty Page: https://bit.ly/2NhdBVH  \nBook “Becoming God: Pure Reason in Early Greek Philosophy”: https://amzn.to/2YjaP3a  \nQuillette essays: https://bit.ly/31UAH7M\n",
