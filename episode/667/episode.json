Originally from Vermont, Dr. Gregg studied the echolocation abilities of wild dolphins in Japan and the Bahamas. He is the author of If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal: What Animal Intelligence Reveals About Human Stupidity.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal. We first talk about Nietzsche’s thoughts on other animals. We go through several aspects of animal psychology, including intelligence, an understanding of causality, deception and lying, an understanding of death and time, norms and morality, consciousness and self-awareness, and prognostic myopia, and we talk about some of their drawbacks. We ask if there is a relationship between biological complexity and evolutionary success. We talk about what is psychologically unique in humans. Finally, we discuss if the planet is better off with us, and the goal of the book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> What Nietzsche thought about animals  \n<time>01:43</time> Intelligence  \n<time>07:35</time> Understanding causality  \n<time>11:57</time> Deception and lying  \n<time>18:43</time> Understanding death and time  \n<time>22:06</time> Norms and morality  \n<time>30:42</time> Consciousness and self-awareness  \n<time>36:15</time> Prognostic myopia  \n<time>39:11</time> Biological complexity and evolutionary success  \n<time>42:29</time> Is there anything that is uniquely human?  \n<time>43:29</time> Is the planet better off with us?  \n<time>45:33</time> The goal of the book  \n<time>47:31</time> Follow Dr. Gregg’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Gregg’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3RqcbFk  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3PjMSTl  \nIf Nietzsche Were a Narwhal: https://amzn.to/3PoaHcX  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3AQEKFQ  \nTwitter handle: @justindgregg\n",
