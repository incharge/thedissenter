shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 17th 2024.  \nDr. Oliver Traldi is a John and Daria\
  \ Barry Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James Madison Program at Princeton University.\
  \ He studies epistemology, focusing on questions about the nature of epistemic norms\
  \ and the epistemology of the social world, especially the epistemology of politics.\
  \ He works on norms of inquiry, conceptual engineering, reasons for belief, inferring\
  \ beliefs from actions, the epistemology of disagreement, and the epistemology of\
  \ moral progress. He is the author of Political Beliefs: A Philosophical Introduction.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Political Beliefs. We start by discussing what political\
  \ epistemology is, what counts as political, what political beliefs are, and what\
  \ political disagreements are based on. We then go through theories of political\
  \ beliefs, including the ones based on personality and moral foundations theory,\
  \ ideology, group membership, social isolation, and cognitive heuristics. We talk\
  \ about the epistemology of democracy and expertise. We address the issue of conspiracy\
  \ theories. Finally, we discuss whether the history of our society has any bearing\
  \ on our political beliefs.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:34</time>\
