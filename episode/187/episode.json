excerpt: "Dr. Robert Trivers is an American evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist.\
  \ He proposed the theories of reciprocal altruism (1971), parental investment (1972),\
  \ facultative sex ratio determination (1973), and parent\u2013offspring conflict\
  \ (1974). He has also contributed by explaining self-deception as an adaptive evolutionary\
  \ strategy (first described in 1976) and discussing intragenomic conflict. Steven\
  \ Pinker considers Dr. Trivers to be \"one of the great thinkers in the history\
  \ of Western thought\". He\u2019s also the author of books like Social Evolution\

  \ Life: Adventures of an Evolutionary Biologist (2015).\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about all of the major contributions of Dr. Trivers\u2019 to the field of Evolutionary\
  \ Biology. First, we look through some of the major advancements in Evolutionary\
  \ Biology since Darwin, particularly kin selection, inclusive fitness theory, and\
  \ sexual selection. Dr. Trivers tells us about how we arrived at his theories of\
  \ parental investment, reciprocal altruism, and parent-offspring conflict. We explore\
  \ parental investment in its several dimensions and implications. Then, we discuss\
  \ parent-offspring conflict and the many ways it can manifest across species. We\
  \ also refer to reciprocal altruism and the situations where friends can be more\
  \ aligned with our interests than our own family. After that, we talk about deceit\
  \ and self-deception, how they work, and some of the domains where they might have\
  \ the biggest impact. We briefly discuss the modularity of mind approach. Finally,\
  \ Dr. Trivers comments on group selection, and I also ask him to tell us about his\
  \ more recent work on the evolutionary bases of honor killings in humans societies.\n\
