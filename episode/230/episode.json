He does work in computational biology and contributes to various open source software projects.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about some general topics in evolutionary biology. We first discuss the basic ingredients we need to have evolution by natural selection, and the mechanisms associated with it. We refer to some of the issues about the “extended evolutionary synthesis”, as proposed by some biologists. We then talk about the interplay between culture and biology in humans, and why human behavior is more complex than the behavior of other species. We also discuss the issues surrounding the concept of “race”, and how to properly think about human variation. Finally, we talk about how we can know that a trait is an adaptation in evolutionary biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:14</time> What do we need to have evolution by natural selection?  \n<time>08:12</time> Levels of selection  \n<time>13:18</time> Problems with the “extended evolutionary synthesis”, and things like epigenetics                               \n<time>21:10</time> The influence of culture on human evolution and behavior  \n<time>26:18</time> Studying human behavior  \n<time>29:44</time> Human variation, and the concept of race  \n<time>37:26</time> The usefulness of “race” for the medical field  \n<time>44:49</time> How do we know if something is an adaptation?  \n<time>53:32</time> Follow Dr. Vos’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Vos’ work:  \nNaturalis Biodiversity Center Personal Page: http://bit.ly/2LHRo1n  \nNaturalis Biodiversity Page: http://bit.ly/2YloLsA  \nBlog: http://bit.ly/2yd7yHd  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2YmLg0f  \nCoursera profile: http://bit.ly/2Y7NPbl  \nTwitter handle: @rvosa  \nGot Academy (YouTube): http://bit.ly/2K4Txkx  \nGot Academy (podcast): http://bit.ly/2SJedlL\n",
