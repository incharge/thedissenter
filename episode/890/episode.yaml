  \ A memoir.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about topics in social psychology. We start\
  \ by talking about attribution theory, and how bad people are at identifying the\
  \ reasoning processes that caused them to behave in a particular way. We then talk\
  \ about reasoning, intelligence and IQ, and non-IQ cognitive skills. We discuss\
  \ cognitive differences between people in the West and people in East Asia, how\
  \ to interpret them, and how malleable they are. Finally, we talk about the replication\
  \ crisis in psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:51  Attribution theory\
