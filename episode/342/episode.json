He is a biological anthropologist specializing in evolutionary psychology, the study of the mind’s evolved mechanisms and processes. In his work he uses methods from anthropology and psychology to examine universals and variation in how thinking develops across cultures. He conducts field research among the Shuar, an indigenous culture in southeast Ecuador, as well as in Los Angeles. His research has focused on learning and conceptual development in several domains, including “theory of mind,” or the ability to make inferences about others’ thoughts and intentions, and learning about danger. He has also collaborated with a variety of anthropologists, psychologists, and other social scientists on a variety of topics ranging from infant-directed speech to the evolution of morality, and supervise graduate projects on the evolution of cognition. He’s the author of the book The Shape of Thought: How Mental Adaptations Evolve.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the topic of mental adaptations. We first ask what a mental adaptation is. We also refer to modularity of mind, and talk about domain-specific and domain-general modules. Toward the end, we discuss dual-systems theory, and the role that consciousness plays in decision-making.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:24</time> What is a mental adaptation?  \n<time>11:33</time> About mental modules  \n<time>18:44</time> Are all modules adaptations?  \n<time>21:55</time> Domain-specific and domain-general modules  \n<time>28:22</time> Are there really open-ended modules?  \n<time>35:05</time> Is there a set of criteria to classify something as an adaptation?  \n<time>38:58</time> Does dual-systems theory have any merit?  \n<time>45:06</time> The role of consciousness  \n<time>54:38</time> Follow Dr. Barrett’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Barrett’s work:  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3bS7tLT  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2unzmdO  \nScientific contributions on ResearchGate: http://bit.ly/38TpDuQ  \nThe Shape of Thought: How Mental Adaptations Evolve: https://amzn.to/2VujGzT\n",
