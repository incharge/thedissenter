shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 3rd, 2019.  \nDr. Kristin Andrews is York Research\
  \ Chair in Animal Minds and Professor of Philosophy at York University (Toronto),\
  \ where she also helps coordinate the Cognitive Science program and the Toronto\
  \ Area Animal Cognition Discussion Group. Dr. Andrews is on the board of directors\
  \ of the Borneo Orangutan Society Canada, a member of the College of the Royal Society\
  \ of Canada, and the author of several books on social minds, animal minds, and\
  \ ethics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how to properly study animal minds,\
  \ and also issues regarding animal ethics. We start by discussing how difficult\
  \ it is to study non-human animals\u2019 behavior and minds, and Dr. Andrews presents\
  \ the calibration method. We also discuss how we can use folk psychology as a starting\
  \ point. We talk about the flaws with anthropomorphism and anthropectomy. We then\
  \ get into the issue of theory of mind, and how to deal with consciousness in animal\
  \ cognitive studies. Dr. Andrews also refers to recent exciting research that points\
  \ to the possibility of plants also having consciousness and minds. Finally, we\
  \ get into animal ethics, and discuss specifically issues related to how we can\
  \ determine if there are other animals that also are moral agents, and how to study\
  \ moral normativity in non-human animals. We end up by talking a bit about veganism.\n\
