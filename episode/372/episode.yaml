shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 12th, 2020.  \nDr. Thibaud Gruber is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Geneva, and he is also part of the Swiss Center\
  \ for Affective Sciences. A primatologist halfway between Switzerland and the UK.\
  \ Working with chimps, orangutans and bonobos, he is interested in the evolutionary\
  \ origins of culture and language.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on tool use and\
  \ vocalizations from chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans. We start with toll use,\
  \ and go through some general topics, like how transmission of cultural knowledge\
  \ occurs in these species, if they have cumulative culture or not, and their relationship\
  \ with us. We then talk about vocalizations and intentional communication, before\
  \ addressing the topics of affective social learning, behavioral plasticity, and\
  \ the relation between environmental variation and the evolution of culture. Finally,\
  \ we discuss overimitation in human infants. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:41</time>\
