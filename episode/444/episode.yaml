shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 25th 2020.  \nDr. Joel Paris is Professor and Chair\
  \ of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University, and Research Associate in\
  \ the Department of Psychiatry at Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital.\
  \ His research interests include developmental factors in personality disorders\
  \ (especially borderline personality), and culture and personality. He\u2019s the\
  \ author of many books, including An Evidence-Based Critique of Contemporary Psychoanalysis,\
  \ The Fall of an Icon: Psychoanalysis and Academic Psychiatry, and Fads and Fallacies\
  \ in Psychiatry.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on psychoanalysis. We start with a\
  \ history of psychoanalysis, and its theoretical bases. We talk about the importance\
  \ of taking individual differences into account when studying human psychology.\
  \ The clinical aspect of psychoanalysis, and comparing it to cognitive-behavioral\
  \ therapy. We discuss what psychoanalysis gets wrong about the subconscious mind,\
  \ repressed memories, and defense mechanisms. We talk about how psychoanalysts have\
  \ been trying to force neuroscience into their preconceived theories. We address\
  \ some of the most pressing issues in modern psychiatry. We finish by asking if\
  \ it is possible to reconcile psychoanalysis with modern scientific psychology.\n\
