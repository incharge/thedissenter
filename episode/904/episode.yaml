  \ talking about what we pay attention to when we perceive other people, the kinds\
  \ of information we get from faces, and facing-dyad perception. We discuss minimal\
  \ social scenes, how we distinguish between interaction and non-interacting dyads,\
  \ and how socially relevant spatial relations are represented visually. We talk\
  \ about body-form and body-motion perception. We discuss how we represent social\
  \ entities differently from their relations, and how we learn about the kind of\
  \ relationship a particular dyad has. We talk about areas of the brain that process\
  \ social information. Finally, we get into how we process information about nonhuman\
  \ bipeds and quadrupeds.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:47  What do we pay\
