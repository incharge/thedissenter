First, we talk about the several cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy. Then, we discuss emotion regulation and how it relates to empathy, as well as the developmental stages children go through when it comes to emotion regulation. We also refer to the relationship between emotion regulation and happiness, and the perils of focusing too much on happiness. Finally, we talk about the relationship between empathy and cruelty.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:09</time> Empathy is not a single phenomenon  \n<time>07:53</time> Emotion regulation, and its relationship with empathy                       \n<time>11:06</time> The developmental stages of emotion regulation                             \n<time>16:27</time> The relationship between emotion regulation and happiness and wellbeing                     \n<time>21:03</time> The problem with focusing too much on happiness                          \n<time>25:44</time> Are there any links between personality and emotion regulation?                       \n<time>28:42</time> Empathic concern and personal distress    \n<time>32:58</time> The “one-among-others” effect    \n<time>35:51</time> The relationship between empathy and cruelty      \n<time>43:31</time> In what conditions do people make others feel bad to help them?  \n<time>51:03</time> Follow Dr. López-Pérez’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. López-Pérez’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2JjNv28  \nArticles of Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2H9tY1W  \nCruel to be kind: should you sometimes be bad for another’s good?
