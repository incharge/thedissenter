We talk about how sociality evolved from Old World monkeys to chimpanzees and to humans. We refer to the role of biological kin selection, and the biological traits that provided a basis for the cultural evolution of kin systems. We discuss the social function of kin systems, their limits, and group identities beyond kin.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:51</time> The evolutionary bases of human sociality, and comparisons with other primate societies (Old World monkeys and chimpanzees)  \n<time>08:01</time> The role of (biological) kin selection  \n<time>15:29</time> Do we need reciprocal altruism to explain human sociality?                                   \n<time>18:05</time> The role of pair-bonding in the structuring of human societies  \n<time>35:50</time> The biological traits at the basis of cultural kin systems  \n<time>44:54</time> The role of kin systems/terminologies in hunter-gatherer societies  \n<time>49:28</time> The limits to kinship  \n<time>56:45</time> Group identities above kin  \n<time>1:01:24</time> Are there any patterns in cross-cultural variation in kin systems?  \n<time>1:18:06</time> Follow Dr. Read’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Read’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2DdRWWP  \nResearchgate profile: https://bit.ly/2v0nX05  \nAdacemia.edu profile: https://bit.ly/2Fb57Zy  \nHow Culture Makes Us Human: Primate Social Evolution and the Formation of Human Societies: https://amzn.to/2DbCqL8\n",
