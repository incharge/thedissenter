shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 28th 2021.  \nDr. Andrew Berry is a lecturer in Organismic\
  \ and Evolutionary Biology. He is an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest\
  \ in Alfred Russel Wallace. His research combined field and laboratory methods to\
  \ detect positive Darwinian selection (i.e. adaptive evolution) at the molecular\
  \ level in natural populations. He has published two books: Infinite tropics: an\
  \ Alfred Russel Wallace Anthology, with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould,\
  \ and DNA: The Secret of Life with James Watson.\n\nThis is the second part of our\
  \ 2-part episode on the history of evolutionary theory/biology.   \nYou can find\
  \ part 1 here: https://youtu.be/8dFa2Y2XO4k\n\nIn this episode, we start with population\
  \ genetics, its early developments, how it led to the development of inclusive fitness\
  \ theory, and what happened after the discovery of the double-helix structure of\
  \ the DNA, what we learn about evolution by natural selection by understanding genetics,\
  \ and how to detect adaptive evolution on the level of the genome. We then discuss\
  \ speciation, what we know about it, and some of the controversies there. We address\
  \ specifically the question of why there are more species more densely packed as\
  \ one moves from the poles to the Equator. Finally, we talk about what we can learn\
  \ by studying evolution in islands.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro \
