Dr. Righetti’s research focuses on close relationships. More specifically she studies sacrifice, ambivalence, and how dual processes shape relationship dynamics (e.g., implicit partner evaluations, self-control, automatic processes). Besides obtaining several grants (e.g., the VENI, ORA, and VIDI grants from NWO), she has also won several awards such as the Caryl Rusbult Early Career Award from Relationship Researchers Interest Group (RRIG), the Early Career Award from the European Association of Social Psychology (EASP) and the Raising Star Award from the Association for Psychological Science (APS).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about close relationships. We first discuss sacrifice: what motivates it, when it is expected, when people regret it, and how they weigh its costs. We discuss when empathy is a burden, perceived partner responsiveness, and how people deal with conflict. We talk about the role that self-control plays in close relationships. We discuss interpersonal goal support, and promoting one another’s ideal selves. We talk about attachment security, anxious and avoidant attachment styles, and how security can be fostered. We discuss ambivalence in romantic relationships, and implicit partner evaluation. Finally, we talk about the factors that contribute to the maintenance and decline of relationship satisfaction.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> Sacrifice in romantic relationships: what motivates it, and when it is expected  \n<time>07:29</time> When sacrifice leads to frustration  \n<time>10:31</time> When people regret their sacrifices  \n<time>11:48</time> Weighing the costs of sacrifice  \n<time>13:53</time> When empathy is a burden  \n<time>16:04</time> Perceived partner responsiveness  \n<time>18:19</time> Dealing with conflict  \n<time>23:06</time> The role of self-control in close relationships  \n<time>31:06</time> Interpersonal goal support, and promoting one another’s ideal selves  \n<time>40:56</time> Attachment security, anxious and avoidant attachment styles, and how security can be fostered  \n<time>50:06</time> Ambivalence in romantic relationships  \n<time>53:13</time> Implicit partner evaluation  \n<time>59:32</time> Which factors contribute to the maintenance and decline of relationship satisfaction?  \n<time>1:05:30</time> Follow Dr. Righetti’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Righetti’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3y8BaVs  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3e3rlRT  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3LUcVjH  \nTwitter handle: @righettifra\n",
