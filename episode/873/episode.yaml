shownotes: "Podcast: http://bit.ly/3FeSNqb\n\nRECORDED ON AUGUST 11th 2023.  \nDr.\
  \ Hanno Sauer is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Utrecht University. His main\
  \ research interests are in moral psychology and empirically informed metaethics.\
  \ He is interested in whether and how we can bring empirical data from diverse disciplines\
  \ such as social psychology, neuroscience or cognitive science to bear on questions\
  \ of normative and/or metaethical interests, and what the limits of this approach\
  \ are. His latest book is Moral Teleology: A Theory of Progress.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Moral Teleology. We start by discussing what moral progress is, if\
  \ it is possible, and we get into a moral anti-realist account of moral progress.\
  \ We talk about how we can naturalize teleology. We discuss moral regress, and reactionary\
  \ conservatism. Finally, we talk about institutions of moral progress, and what\
  \ causes it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> What\
