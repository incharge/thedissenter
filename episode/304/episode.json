shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 26th, 2019.  \nBryony Cole is the host of sex tech\
  \ podcast Future of Sex and works as a researcher and strategist in future human\
  \ and technology fields. She is the world\u2019s leading authority on sextech. Since\
  \ launching the top-rated podcast, Future of Sex, Bryony has been on stages across\
  \ the world, defining the direction of sextech for governments, technology and entertainment\
  \ companies. Her wide body of research and annual Future of Sex report are considered\
  \ the lead in industry insights. Bryony is an international speaker, published writer\
  \ and producer, who has been featured on shows like Viceland and Technopia, and\
  \ articles in Wired, TechCrunch, The New York Times, Playboy, Mashable, Motherboard,\
  \ ABC, Financial Review, Brides, Glamour and many other global media.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we address what the future might be reserving for us in terms of sexual\
  \ experiences, human relationships and emergent sex technology. We go through the\
  \ topic of how and why sex is still a social taboo. We clarify the fact that, even\
  \ though we focus a lot on the technology, the future will also include the human\
  \ relationships themselves. We refer to some non-normative sex preferences, and\
  \ how society deals with \u201Cdeviant\u201D sex behavior. We then discuss modern\
  \ sex education, particularly in the West, and the new challenges, particularly\
  \ coming from learning how to deal with the virtual world, and things like social\
  \ media. We talk about the complex intricacies of pornography and prostitution for\
  \ both the consumer and the performer, connecting it with sex-positive feminism.\
  \ We address technology like sex robots and teledildonics, and the new kinds of\
  \ relationships and experiences that they already allow for. Finally, we briefly\
  \ talk about new relationship styles, like polyamory, and the challenges involved\
  \ there.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:08</time> Sex as a taboo topic (in the XXI century)\
