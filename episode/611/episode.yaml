shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 12th 2022.  \nDr. Jennifer Church is a Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Her research addresses\
  \ various topics in the philosophy of mind. She is the author of Possibilities of\
  \ Perception (Oxford UP, 2013), and Why It\u2019s OK to Be of Two Minds.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s Ok to be of Two Minds. We talk about what it\
  \ means to be of two minds; the positive effects of not eliminating the conflict;\
  \ three different models of dealing with the conflict: a juggler model, an isometrics\
  \ model, and a disruptor model; conflicts with past and future selves; when projecting\
  \ fantasy into reality might become a problem; dealing with inner conflicts through\
  \ laughter and surrealism; when being of two minds is a problem; and what philosophers\
  \ might gain from being have to hold opposing views in their minds.\n\nTime Links:\
