  Professor Robert Boyd (Anthropology, UCLA) headed a multidisciplinary research project
  that models such behaviors as empathy, reciprocity, insider/outsider behavior, vengefulness,
  and other observed human behaviors not well handled by the traditional model of
  the self-regarding agent. Professor Gintis is also author of several books including

  \ behavioral science in general. First, we talk about the historical and scientific\
  \ relevance of sociobiology. Then, we go through one of the big projects of Dr.\
  \ Gintis\u2019 work for the last two decades - a framework for the unification of\
  \ the behavioral sciences \u2013 and the several obstacles that we have to that,\
  \ including the fact that different behavioral sciences have different approaches\
  \ and focus on different aspects. We also talk about the relationship between culture\
  \ and biology. Finally, we go from there to the particularities of human cooperation,\
  \ group selection, and the role that social institutions play.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
