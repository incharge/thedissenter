shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 6th 2024.  \nDr. Paul Thagard is Distinguished Professor\
  \ Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Waterloo and a Fellow of the Royal\
  \ Society of Canada, the Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological\
  \ Science. The Canada Council awarded him a Molson Prize (2007) and a Killam Prize\
  \ (2013). He is a philosopher, cognitive scientist, and author of many interdisciplinary\
  \ books, the latest one being Falsehoods Fly: Why Misinformation Spreads and How\
  \ to Stop It.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Falsehoods Fly. We start by distinguishing\
  \ information from misinformation, and we discuss why we should worry about misinformation.\
  \ We talk about the AIMS Theory of Information and Misinformation. We discuss cognitive\
  \ errors and motivated cognition. We talk about the reliability of news sources,\
  \ and go through several examples of misinformation, namely medical misinformation\
  \ and the COVID-19 pandemic; scientific misinformation and climate change; conspiracy\
  \ theories; political misinformation, and misinformation about inequality; and misinformation\
  \ on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Finally, we discuss how we can prevent misinformation,\
  \ and how this book connects to Dr. Thagard\u2019s The Cognitive Science of Science.\n\
