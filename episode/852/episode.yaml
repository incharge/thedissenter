shownotes: "Dr. Oded Galor is Herbert H. Goldberger Professor of Economics at Brown\
  \ University. Dr. Galor has advanced the field of Unified Growth Theory. He has\
  \ contributed to the understanding of the relationship between inequality and growth,\
  \ human evolution, and the process of development, demography, and growth, and the\
  \ role of deep-rooted factors in comparative economic development. He is the author\
  \ of The Journey of Humanity: The Origins of Wealth and Inequality.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on The Journey of Humanity. We talk about the two main mysteries addressed\
  \ in the book: the mystery of growth, and the mystery of inequality. We talk about\
  \ the migration of H. sapiens out of Africa. We discuss the Malthusian Trap, and\
  \ the conditions where it applies. We discuss the factors behind the development\
  \ of agriculture, and why it could be considered inevitable. We talk about what\
  \ impacted human demographics the most across history. We talk about Dr. Galor\u2019\
  s Unified Growth Theory. We discuss the factors behind the industrial revolution.\
  \ We talk about the relationship between diversity, innovation, and social cohesiveness.\
  \ We discuss population growth and the Demographic Transition, and if we should\
  \ worry about declining fertility rates. Finally, we address the mystery of inequality,\
  \ why there is inequality across societies, and the future of inequality.\n\nTime\
