  \ Behind Revulsion. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the emotion of disgust, and\
  \ how it might have evolved. How it manifests in us and also other animals, in the\
  \ form of avoidance behavior. Also, how disgust eventually leads us to avoid people\
  \ that don\u2019t belong to our social group, and how it might be behind some moral\
  \ norms related to purity and pollution. Finally, we get to talk about how we can\
  \ apply this knowledge to acquire better hygiene habits, and the influence of the\
  \ environment settings.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:40</time> What is disgust, and\
