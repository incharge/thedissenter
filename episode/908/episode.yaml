shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 24th 2023.  \nDr. Joanna Malinowska is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Philosophy at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, Poland. The subject\
  \ of her research is a broadly understood philosophy of science, with particular\
  \ emphasis on philosophy of medicine, philosophy of neurosciences and philosophy\
  \ of psychology. She explores connections between these areas and questions in bioethics,\
  \ epistemology, ontology, and methodology. Her current focus is on the conceptualization\
  \ and use of ethnoracial categories in medicine.\n\nIn this episode, we first talk\
  \ about cultural neuroscience. We then get into the concepts of race and ethnicity,\
  \ their scientific validity, the idea of racialization, and studying differences\
  \ between human populations. We discuss the consequences of racialized medical information,\
  \ and what a postracial medicine could look like. Finally, we talk about empathy\
  \ in human-robot interactions.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:47</time>\
