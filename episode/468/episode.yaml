shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 10th 2021.  \nDr. Andreas Elpidorou is an Associate\
  \ Professor of Philosophy at the University of Louisville. He specializes in the\
  \ philosophical study of the mind and has published extensively on the nature of\
  \ emotions (especially, boredom), consciousness, and cognition. He is best known\
  \ for his work on the function and value of boredom. He is the co-author of Consciousness\
  \ and Physicalism: A Defense of a Research Program (Routledge, 2018), the co-editor\
  \ of Philosophy of Mind and Phenomenology: Conceptual and Empirical Approaches (Routledge,\
  \ 2016), and the author of the recent book, Propelled: How Boredom, Frustration,\
  \ and Anticipation Lead us to the Good Life.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Propelled,\
  \ and talk about boredom, frustration and anticipation, from a philosophical perspective.\
  \ To put things into perspective, we first talk about Robert Nozick\u2019s experience\
  \ machine, and what it tells us about the role of negative emotions. We then address\
  \ boredom, frustration and anticipation, how they work, and their relationship with\
  \ other mental phenomena, like the experience of time, preferences, envy, the IKEA\
  \ effect, memory, and worldviews like optimism and pessimism. In the end, we talk\
  \ about how people can learn to deal with these emotions.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
