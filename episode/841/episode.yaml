shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 26th 2023.  \nDr. Rebecca Tuvel is Associate Professor\
  \ and Chair of Philosophy at Rhodes College. She works in feminist philosophy, philosophy\
  \ of race, and the ethics of identity. Her book project Changing Race: The Ethics\
  \ and Metaphysics of Transracialism explores the possibility and permissibility\
  \ of changing one\u2019s race.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about feminism, cultural\
  \ appropriation, the philosophy of race, and animal ethics. We discuss what it means\
  \ to be a feminist, and why are there so few people identifying as feminists. We\
  \ talk about feminism and intersectionality today. We discuss if feminism should\
  \ include trans women. We talk about epistemic exclusions, the historical exclusion\
  \ of women\u2019s knowledge, and we discuss if there can also be injustices in epistemic\
  \ inclusion. We discuss if cultural appropriation is a problem. We talk about the\
  \ philosophy of race, and go through three main different philosophical approaches\
  \ to race: race anti-realism, social realism, and biological realism. We discuss\
  \ transracialism, if people can change their race, if they should be allowed to\
  \ do so, and if it is analogous to changing one\u2019s gender identity. Finally,\
  \ we talk about animal ethics, and discuss if we should use the knowledge that comes\
  \ from animal experimentation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:55</time>\
