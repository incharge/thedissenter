excerpt: 'Dr. Michael Frank is David and Lucile Packard Professor of Human Biology
  and Director of the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University. He studies
  children''s language learning and how it interacts with their developing understanding
  of the social world. He uses behavioral experiments, computational tools, and novel
  measurement methods like large-scale web-based studies, eye-tracking, and head-mounted
  cameras. He is the founder of the ManyBabies Consortium, a collaborative replication
  network for infancy research, and has led open-data projects including Wordbank
  and MetaLab. He was a Jacobs Foundation Fellow and has received the Troland Award
  from the National Academy of Sciences, the FABBS Early Career Impact Award, and
  the Marr Prize and Glushko Dissertation Prize from the Cognitive Science Society.
  He served as Chair of the Governing Board of the Cognitive Science Society and has
  edited for journals including Cognition and Child Development. '

  \ episode, we talk about child development and language acquisition. We talk about\
  \ infant-directed speech, pragmatic abilities, and similarity reasoning. We get\
  \ into why children learn some words earlier than others; how they infer the meaning\
  \ of words before they begin their formal education; and human universals and variability\
  \ in language acquisition. We discuss why people use polite language. We talk about\
  \ the use of eye-tracking and head-mounted cameras to study children\u2019s early\
  \ social and visual environment. Finally, we discuss parenting attitudes, where\
  \ they come from, and if they translate into actual parenting behavior.\n\nTime\
