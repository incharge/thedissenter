excerpt: 'Dr. Suthan Krishnarajan is Associate Professor in Political Science at Aarhus
  University. His research agenda seeks to understand and explain political regime
  instability. Broadly speaking, a political regime is the rules that determine who
  can access power, and how, in a given country. In democracies, leaders are chosen
  in competitive, free, and fair elections; in autocracies, leaders access power through
  alternative means. In his research, he examines why such regimes sometimes endure
  and at other times break down. I do so from three traditional disciplines in political
  science: comparative politics, public opinion, and international relations.'

shownotes: "Dr. Suthan Krishnarajan is Associate Professor in Political Science at\
  \ Aarhus University. His research agenda seeks to understand and explain political\
  \ regime instability. Broadly speaking, a political regime is the rules that determine\
  \ who can access power, and how, in a given country. In democracies, leaders are\
  \ chosen in competitive, free, and fair elections; in autocracies, leaders access\
  \ power through alternative means. In his research, he examines why such regimes\
  \ sometimes endure and at other times break down. I do so from three traditional\
  \ disciplines in political science: comparative politics, public opinion, and international\
  \ relations.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about regime instability in democracies\
  \ and autocracies. We start by defining democracy. We talk about how people form\
  \ democratic support. We discuss if citizens in Western democracies support democracy,\
  \ and how satisfied they are with it. We talk about when people support undemocratic\
  \ behavior, and how they rationalize it. We discuss evidence-based interventions\
  \ to improve citizens\u2019 democratic values. We discuss if national elections\
  \ are unequivocally good for people\u2019s satisfaction with democracy. We talk\
  \ about factors that lead to democratic breakdown, including economic crises. Finally,\
  \ we discuss how autocratic leaders deal with regime instability and coup attempts.\n\
