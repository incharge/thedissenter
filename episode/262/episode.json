She is also the Creative Director of Pasadena Opera. Dr. Viskontas is a neuroscientist and operatic soprano. She holds a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience and a M.M. in opera. She’s the author of How Music Can Make You Better.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology of music. We first go through how music is a construct of our brains and its evolutionary bases. Then we discuss if music is a human universal, and if anyone can learn music. We talk a bit about the neuroscience of music, and catchy tunes and earworms. Finally, we cover some aspects of music appreciation and the acquisition of musical tastes.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:38</time> Is music a construct of our brains?  \n<time>03:54</time> The evolution of music  \n<time>10:19</time> Is music a human universal?  \n<time>15:16</time> Can anyone learn music?  \n<time>20:15</time> The neuroscience of music  \n<time>24:37</time> How to control emotion during performance  \n<time>29:47</time> About catchy songs and earworms  \n<time>34:27</time> Do we need a cultural background to appreciate a particular song?  \n<time>40:27</time> How we acquire our musical tastes  \n<time>46:25</time> Is there any connection between personality and music preferences?  \n<time>50:45</time> Follow Dr. Viskontas’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Viskontas’ work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2kiQBIb  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2kI0gIp  \nThe Great Courses page: http://bit.ly/33Z2t3H  \nInquiring Minds podcast: http://bit.ly/2KBGrMK  \nCadence podcast: http://bit.ly/2qpw3Rg  \nHow Music Can Make You Better: https://amzn.to/2r8hSQl  \nTwitter handle: @indrevis\n",
