Discover the missing ingredient to a fulfilling life, and The Art of Insubordination: How to Dissent and Defy Effectively.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology of well-being. We first define it as a psychological construct, and discuss how it is measured. We discuss aspects of psychology that correlate with well-being, like being future-oriented, having goals, and being a good person. We talk about individual differences in personality traits, how people react to life events, and changes in well-being across the lifespan. We discuss psychological strengths and psychological flexibility. Finally, we talk about the link between well-being and interpersonal relationships.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> What is well-being?  \n<time>01:17</time> How is it measured?  \n<time>07:45</time> Future-orientation, and being a long-term or short-term planner  \n<time>15:08</time> Do people need goals?  \n<time>17:19</time> Being a good person  \n<time>18:51</time> Personality traits  \n<time>21:10</time> Other psychological traits  \n<time>24:14</time> Reacting to life events  \n<time>25:42</time> Do levels of well-being change across the lifespan?  \n<time>27:50</time> Psychological strengths  \n<time>30:23</time> Psychological flexibility  \n<time>37:39</time> The link between well-being and interpersonal relationships  \n<time>39:31</time> A final message on well-being  \n<time>41:04</time> Follow Dr. Kashdan’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Kashdan’s work:  \nFirst interview: https://youtu.be/GadlKjkoRjU  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3rZgXxK  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/34mp0fB  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3rxSZdw  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3jNwvRr  \nTwitter handle: @toddkashdan\n",
