You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/04yvn-B7vRg\n\nIn this episode, we talk about dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We start by discussing the differences between computational-representational approaches and dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We talk about 4E cognition. We then get into a recent paper by Dr. Hipólito, Mind as Motion, and talk about a shift in psychology towards dynamical approaches, and the role of the sociocultural context. We discuss if psychological experiences have any intrinsic value, and if science is value-free or independent of any sociocultural context. Finally, we discuss if AI systems can become human-like if they are not embodied.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:05</time> Computational-representational approaches and dynamical approaches in cognitive science  \n<time>08:43</time> 4E cognition  \n<time>25:36</time> Mind as Motion - a shift in psychology toward dynamical approaches  \n<time>43:14</time> The sociocultural context  \n<time>48:41</time> Do psychological experiences have any intrinsic value?  \n<time>54:12</time> Is science really value-free or independent of any sociocultural context?  \n<time>59:12</time> A pluralistic approach in psychology?  \n<time>1:10:09</time> Can AI systems become human-like if they are not embodied?  \n<time>1:13:41</time> Follow Dr. Hipólito’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hipólito’s work:  \nUniversity page: http://bit.ly/3RLOU0U  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3jKaxSW  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3YEKvzn  \nTwitter handle: @ineshipolito\n",
