shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 25th 2022.  \nDr. Dario Maestripieri is a Professor\
  \ in Comparative Human Development and is also affiliated with the Institute on\
  \ the Formation of Knowledge at the University of Chicago. His current main interests\
  \ are, a) evolution of human behavior and its biological regulation, b) 20th century\
  \ European literature.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about human nature, individual\
  \ differences, knowledge, and consilience. We discuss what human nature is, how\
  \ to account for individual differences in human behavior, and personality. We ask\
  \ if humans are an aggressive or peaceful species. We discuss the costs and benefits\
  \ of knowledge and ignorance. We talk about what we can learn about human nature\
  \ by studying art and literature. Finally, we discuss if knowledge is unitary, the\
  \ concept of consilience, and how we can reach it.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
