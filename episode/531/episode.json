  In this episode, we talk about common knowledge. We start with some basic definitions\
  \ of private knowledge, shared knowledge, and common knowledge. We then get into\
  \ some examples of domains where common knowledge applies, like economic games,\
  \ self-conscious emotions, charitable behavior, the bystander effect, and indirect\
  \ speech.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:30</time> Private\
