shownotes: "Dr. Alessandra Cassar is a Professor of Economics at the University of\
  \ San Francisco. She is the Vice-President for North America of the Economic Science\
  \ Association. Her current research concentrates on the under-studied areas of female\
  \ competitiveness; the consequences of conflict and disaster victimization for altruism,\
  \ trust, religiosity, risk, and time preferences; and the role of social networks\
  \ for economic outcomes.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about female competitiveness\
  \ and what motivates it; sex differences in competitiveness, and their effects in\
  \ the workplace and the job market. We discuss the evolution of prosociality anchored\
  \ to human cooperative breeding. We talk about differences in competition and cooperation\
  \ between monogamous and polygynous households. We discuss how civil conflict affects\
  \ trust and market development, and the effects of natural disasters on altruism.\
  \ We get into how microfinancing works, and how social capital applies to it; the\
  \ role of goals, incentives, and support groups in the success of microentrepreneurs;\
  \ and what financial exclusion is, and how it affects people. Finally, we talk about\
  \ networked markets, and trade with cheating; and coordination and cooperation in\
  \ games played on local, random and small-world networks.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
