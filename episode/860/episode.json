In addition, Dr. Mongle is interested in evaluating the relationship between variation, evolvability, and macroevolution in the primate dentition.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about hominin phylogenetics. We first talk about work done in the Turkana Basin in Kenya. We talk about craniodental and postcranial features looked at when studying human phylogenetics, and changes in hominin dentition. We discuss what we know about hominin phylogeny, and the cases of Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus sediba. We talk about studying microevolution and macroevolution, and how they interact. We talk about the example of primate molars. We discuss the relationship between development and evolution. We talk about how we can best model hominin evolution. Finally, we discuss some unanswered questions in human phylogenetics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Hominin fossils from the Turkana Basin in Kenya  \n<time>03:20</time> Craniodental and postcranial features  \n<time>07:08</time> Changes in hominin dentition  \n<time>09:12</time> What we know about hominin phylogeny  \n<time>11:16</time> Ardipithecus ramidus  \n<time>14:06</time> Australopithecus sediba  \n<time>17:05</time> Studying microevolution and macroevolution, and how they interact  \n<time>21:28</time> Primates molars, and the alignment of micro and macroevolution  \n<time>23:28</time> The relationship between development and evolution  \n<time>26:15</time> Modelling hominin evolution  \n<time>28:18</time> Unanswered questions in human phylogenetics  \n<time>34:07</time> Dr. Mongle’s current work  \n<time>36:07</time> Follow Dr. Mongle’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mongle’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/44JH4KS  \nMongle Lab: https://bit.ly/3PUDrNZ  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/46Pra3p  \nTwitter handle: @CarrieMongle\n",
