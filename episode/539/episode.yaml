  \ for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in\
  \ Berlin, Germany. His research interests include models of bounded and ecological\
  \ rationality; decisions from experience; the psychology of risk; lifespan development\
  \ of decision making; and evidence-based public policy. He is the editor of Deliberate\
  \ Ignorance: Choosing Not to Know.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Deliberate Ignorance.\
  \ We define bounded rationality, ecological rationality, and deliberate ignorance.\
  \ We talk about the cognitive bases of deliberate rationality, and its relationship\
  \ with biases and heuristics. We discuss how deliberate ignorance can occur in institutions.\
  \ We talk about a possible evolutionary rationale for deliberate ignorance, what\
  \ we know about its development in children, and also the cross-cultural evidence\
  \ for it. We also discuss individual differences in deliberate ignorance, and the\
  \ correlation with scores on the Big Five\u2019s openness to experience. We discuss\
  \ how deliberate ignorance manifests itself in science. Finally, we talk about when\
  \ and why we should fight against deliberate ignorance. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
