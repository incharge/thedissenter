shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 7th 2023.  \nDr. Jeffrey Lees is Associate Research\
  \ Scholar in the Behavioral Science for Policy Lab at Princeton University. He received\
  \ his Ph.D. in Organizational Behavior & Psychology from Harvard University in 2020.\
  \ He is a behavioral scientist studying the consequences of inaccurate beliefs for\
  \ organizations, politics, and society.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about implicit\
  \ attitudes and meta-perceptions, and how they apply to politics and morality. We\
  \ start by discussing what implicit attitudes are, and how they are studied and\
  \ measured. We talk about social judgments of other people\u2019s preferences, and\
  \ their accuracy. We discuss group meta-perceptions, how they drive negative out-group\
  \ attributions, and their relationship with political violence. We then get into\
  \ social influences on moral cognition, and also talk about meta-perceptions of\
  \ morally questionable actors. Finally, we discuss misperceived polarization and\
  \ where it stems from, and strategies to address political polarization.\n\nTime\
