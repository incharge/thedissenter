excerpt: "Dr. PauIo Castro graduated in Anthropology at the NOVA University of Lisbon\
  \ in 1996 after studying Physics at the University of Lisbon. He taught Mathematics\
  \ and IT in Secondary and Polythecnical schools. In 2014 he obtained his PhD in\
  \ the Philosophy of Contemporary Thought at the Universidade Lus\xF3fona de Humanidades\
  \ e Tecnologias, with the dissertation \u201CThe Epistemology of Choice \u2013 On\
  \ the possibility of artificial simulation of human intelligence\u201D. In 2015\
  \ Dr. Castro became a member of the Center for Philosophy of Science of the University\
  \ of Lisbon in the Philosophy of Nature Sciences Research Group, working on Philosophy\
  \ of Quantum Physics. Recently, and pursuing more foundational questions in Physics,\
  \ he\u2019s started working on the Philosophy of Quantum Gravity. He is also very\
  \ interested in both Artificial Intelligence and Environmental Philosophy, related\
  \ to Sustainability."

  \ We talk about the pilot wave theory, quantum gravity, and the EmDrive, or the\
  \ radio frequency (RF) resonant cavity thruster. In the last part of the interview,\
  \ we also discuss the relationship between philosophy and science in the modern\
  \ era. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:24</time> The pilot wave theory in quantum physics\
  \  \n<time>17:01</time> We can\u2019t understand space-time with just our intuitions\
  \  \n<time>28:37</time> Quantum gravity                                \n<time>35:44</time>\
  \ Could it be possible to integrate General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics? \
  \ \n<time>41:58</time> Can we have an observer-independent Quantum Physics?  \n\
  <time>45:52</time> The EmDrive, or a device that could break Newton\u2019s third\
  \ law of motion  \n<time>58:52</time> The modern relationship between philosophy\
  \ and science  \n<time>1:14:13</time> Follow Dr. Castro\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\n\
