  \ Professor of History at Cornell University. His research and teaching interests\
  \ revolve around the intersections of space, politics, and everyday practice. He\
  \ is the author of Adventure Capitalism: A History of Libertarian Exit, from the\
  \ Era of Decolonization to the Digital Age.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Adventure\
  \ Capitalism. We talk about what characterizes libertarianism in the US, and how\
  \ it became popular in the 1960s. We discuss exit projects, and how people planned\
  \ to create new countries in places undergoing decolonization. We talk about contemporary\
  \ Silicon Valley techno-libertarians. We discuss if capitalism can really operate\
  \ without the state. Finally, we talk about how these projects might intersect with\
  \ the history of twentieth-century capitalism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
