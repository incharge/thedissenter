  \ of the Neural Circuits, Consciousness and Cognition Group at the Max Planck Institute\
  \ for Empirical Aesthetics. Her research areas include domain-general cortical computations,\
  \ neural mechanisms by which the brain predictively controls sensory processing\
  \ and perception, brain mechanism subserving language comprehension, and possibilities\
  \ and limits of brain plasticity to restore cognitive functions.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about consciousness, language, and neuroplasticity. We start with consciousness,\
  \ how it is studied in neuroscience, the neural correlates of consciousness, the\
  \ hard problem of consciousness, and its causal power over behavior. We discuss\
  \ conscious perception, and how language connects to consciousness. Finally, we\
  \ talk about the limits of neuroplasticity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
