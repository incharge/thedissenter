  of Anthropology at Washington State University, where he studies long-distance relationships
  and natural resource management in Tanzania in collaboration with Anne Pisor and
  Monique Borgerhoff Mulder. This project applies evolutionary anthropology to better
  understand how communities can work together to manage shared, open-access fisheries.
  He previously worked as a research associate for the Geography of Philosophy Project,
  led by Edouard Machery, Clark Barrett, and Stephen Stich, examining cultural variation
  in folk concepts of knowledge, wisdom, and reasoning. He also worked with Coren

  \ We talk about partner choice models, and the \u201Canomalous-is-bad\u201D stereotype.\
  \ We also discuss if people prefer deontologists or consequentialists when it comes\
  \ to moral character. We discuss long-distance relationships and resource management,\
  \ and how people from different groups maintain cooperation. Throughout the interview\
  \ we focus mostly on the Hadza and people from Tanzania. Finally, we talk about\
  \ human universals and cross-cultural variation.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
