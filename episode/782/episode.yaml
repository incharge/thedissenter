shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 26th 2022.  \nDr. Gillian Forrester is a Professor\
  \ of Comparative Cognition in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex.\
  \ She is the director of the Comparative Cognition Group investigating the behaviors\
  \ and brain organization of children, gorillas and chimpanzees focusing on how cognitive\
  \ abilities evolve and develop over time and across species.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the evolution of handedness and how it relates to language and other\
  \ cognitive abilities. We first define handedness, and talk about how it evolved.\
  \ We discuss if human hands are more dexterous, and how handedness works in Great\
  \ apes. We discuss if it is innate, and which environmental factors play a role\
  \ in its development. We then get into the neuroscience of handedness and how it\
  \ relates to cerebral lateralization. We talk about how cerebral lateralization\
  \ might connect to (higher) cognitive functions, and we discuss if there is a relationship\
  \ between handedness and cognitive ability. We also discuss the relationship between\
  \ handedness (and motor function more generally) and language, and the biological\
  \ precursors of language. Finally, Dr. Forrester answers a question from a patron.\n\
