  \ Technologies of the Soul in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Self-Improvement. We start by talking about the philosophical history\
  \ behind the culture of self-improvement. We discuss how we present ourselves on\
  \ social media, and the idea of \u201Cauthenticity\u201D. We talk about spiritual\
  \ narcissism, and the current popularity of stoicism. We discuss how we obsess with\
  \ self-improvement, and ignore collective solutions and political and socioeconomic\
  \ issues. We talk about self-improvement as a means of class signaling, and \u201C\
  technosolutionist\u201D approaches involving transhumanism and self-enhancement.\
  \ We discuss how neoliberalism ties to self-improvement ideas, and how obsessed\
  \ we are with being productive. Finally, we talk about how we can reframe self-improvement,\
  \ and a positive role for technology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
