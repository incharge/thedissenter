  \ we first talk about dual-process theory, reasoning and rationality, motivated\
  \ reasoning, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the analytic cognitive style and ability.\
  \ We then go through what characterizes pseudo-profound bullshit in terms of discourse,\
  \ the language of climate change deniers, and fake news and misinformation (particularly\
  \ on the internet).\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:28</time> Differences between intuitive\
