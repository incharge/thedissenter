  \nIn this episode, our conversation we focused initially on Evolutionary and Contextual\
  \ Behavioral Science, the recently published book edited by Dr. David Sloan Wilson\
  \ and Dr. Steven C. Hayes. We discuss what evolutionary theory brings to the table,\
  \ and its shortcomings in dealing with behavior (human and non-human), and the contributions\
  \ of Skinner, behaviorism and contextual science that have been mostly ignored by\
  \ mainstream Psychology. We then talk about the extended evolutionary synthesis,\
  \ and how Lamarckism might still have a saying in how evolution by natural selection\
  \ works. Finally, we briefly talk about religion as a human construct, and what\
  \ the New Atheists get wrong about it; and about group selection included in a multilevel\
  \ selection process.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:05</time> Evolutionary and Contextual\
