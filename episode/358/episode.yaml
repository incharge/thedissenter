shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 20th 2020.  \nDr. Michael McCullough is a professor of\
  \ psychology at the University of California San Diego, where he directs the Evolution\
  \ and Human Behavior Laboratory. Most of the research they conduct in the lab is\
  \ focused on extending an evolutionary analysis to some of the key psychological\
  \ features of human social life. He is the author of several books, including \u201C\
  Beyond Revenge: The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct,\u201D and, the most recent\
  \ one, \u201CThe Kindness of Strangers: How a Selfish Ape Invented a New Moral Code\u201D\
  .\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. McCullough\u2019s new book, The Kindness of\
  \ Strangers. We talk about the evolutionary bases of altruism, including kin selection,\
  \ reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and group selection. We discuss how\
  \ empathy works, and the people we tend to empathize and help the most. We then\
  \ go through seven ages and eras that Dr. McCullough presents on the book as having\
  \ influenced the cultural evolution of our altruism: the Age of Orphans, the Age\
  \ of Compassion; the Age of Prevention, the First Poverty Enlightenment Era, the\
  \ Humanitarian Big Bang, the Second Poverty Enlightenment, and the Age of Impact.\
  \ In our current age, we focus on the role that the internet and social media play,\
  \ and also on effective altruism. Finally, we talk about practical reasoning, and\
  \ the issues we have to deal with in the future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>02:18</time>\
