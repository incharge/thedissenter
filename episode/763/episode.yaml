shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 13th 2022.  \nDr. Mitch Brown is an instructor and\
  \ researcher in Psychology at the University of Arkansas. His research uses complementary\
  \ social and evolutionary perspectives in understanding how fundamental social motives\
  \ shape social perceptions and interpersonal preferences. This work primarily considers\
  \ (1) the tradeoffs people invoke to avoid disease and belong to groups, (2) the\
  \ prioritization of physical features and behaviors in shaping preferences for short-term\
  \ and long-term mates, and (3) how inferences of men\u2019s formidability inform\
  \ stereotypes of personality and social functions. From an increasingly applied\
  \ standpoint, his research considers how evolutionary motives impede fair treatment\
  \ of individuals under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ topics in evolutionary psychology. We start with the evolution of pathogen avoidance\
  \ behaviors. We discuss the physical features that men and women look for in a potential\
  \ partner, and the information regarding personality and motivational states people\
  \ derive from facial and bodily features. We talk about humor styles, focusing on\
  \ aggressive and self-defeating humor, and the personality traits of people who\
  \ use them. Other topics include: the relationship between formidability and political\
  \ militancy and moral foundations; limbal rings; and mom and dad bods, and parenting\
  \ ability.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:54</time> The\
