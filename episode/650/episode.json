Her current research focus is women's psychology as potential or actual mothers or allomothers, and sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. Of particular interest to her, is our ability to creatively label or act on evolved desires in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even or especially where these are not consciously known to us, and to influence others.\n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly on motherhood and marital surname changes. We start with the questions that the evolutionary psychology of motherhood focusses on, and also discuss allomothering. We talk about sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. We discuss marital surname changes and several factors and predictors associated with them, like earning capacity and economic inequality. We also discuss outcomes like marital duration, and number of children. Finally, we ask if feminism and evolutionary psychology really need to be in conflict with one another.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> The evolutionary psychology of motherhood  \n<time>04:46</time> Allomothering  \n<time>12:09</time> Sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships  \n<time>16:04</time> Factors associated with marital surname changes – earning capacity and economic inequality  \n<time>19:28</time> Costly signaling  \n<time>22:20</time> More predictors of marital surname change  \n<time>24:16</time> Hypergamous mating strategies  \n<time>27:11</time> Surname change and marital duration  \n<time>32:27</time> Do men change their surnames?  \n<time>34:33</time> Surname change and number of children  \n<time>37:54</time> Future mating prospects after divorce  \n<time>40:11</time> Do feminism and evolutionary psychology need to be in conflict?  \n<time>45:17</time> Follow Dr. MacEacheron’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. MacEacheron’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/32Spp99  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3Js6KSa\n",
