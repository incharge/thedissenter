shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 17th 2023.  \nDr. Anil Seth is Professor of Cognitive\
  \ and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, where he is also Director\
  \ of the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science. He is also Co-Director of the\
  \ Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Program on Brain, Mind, and Consciousness,\
  \ and of the Leverhulme Doctoral Scholarship Programme: From Sensation and Perception\
  \ to Awareness. He is also an Engagement Fellow with the Wellcome Trust. He is the\
  \ author of several books, the latest one being Being You: A New Science of Consciousness.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Being You. We start by discussing what consciousness\
  \ is, and how to study it scientifically. We talk about what consciousness is good\
  \ for. We address the recent \u201Ccontroversy\u201D surrounding Integrated Information\
  \ Theory of Consciousness, and discuss how science is done. We talk about the idea\
  \ of the brain as a prediction machine, how perception works, and how objective\
  \ reality relates to perception. We discuss the notion of \u201Cself\u201D. Finally,\
  \ we talk about what we know about non-human animal consciousness, and whether machines\
  \ can become conscious.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time>\
