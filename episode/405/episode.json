shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 2nd 2020.  \nDr. Andrew Gallup is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Psychology and the director of the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) Lab\
  \ at SUNY Poly. His research spans a variety of topics, including contagious behavior\
  \ and comparative neuroanatomy, brain thermoregulation and vigilance, collective\
  \ behavior and social cognition, aggression and sexual conflict, the evolution of\
  \ cooperation, sports and athletic competition from an evolutionary perspective,\
  \ biomarkers of Darwinian fitness, and the effects of neuromodulation on adaptive\
  \ responses.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about aggression, and the evolution of\
  \ yawning. We first tackle the evolutionary bases of aggression, and the social\
  \ functions that it serves, and how we can apply this knowledge to combat bullying.\
  \ We mention sex differences, and also how aggression changes across human development,\
  \ with focus on men and testosterone. We then get into the evolutionary function\
  \ of yawning, and ask if it really is socially contagious.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time>\
