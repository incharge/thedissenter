  \ about the work of \xC9mile Durkheim on suicide, and suicide in the context of\
  \ conflict. Other topics include economic, social factors, and cultural factors\
  \ behind suicide; if suicide is really the result of mental illness; the relationship\
  \ between suicide and homicide; if suicide is rational; and ways of preventing it.\n\
