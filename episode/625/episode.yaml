  \nIn this episode, we talk about the relationship between mating strategies and\
  \ socio-political orientation, and laughter. We start by defining mating strategies\
  \ and socio-political orientation. We then get into the relationship between the\
  \ both of them, and into several of the cues people pick from the mating market\
  \ that influence their own mating strategies. We discuss why people care about other\
  \ people\u2019s mating strategies. We talk about how age and gender might influence\
  \ political orientation. We get into the rationale behind suppressing female sexuality.\
  \ We talk about support for same-sex rights and for economic issues, like wealth\
  \ redistribution. We discuss the role of sex ratios. Finally, we talk a bit about\
  \ laughter.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> What\
