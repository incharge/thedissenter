She serves as Editor-in-Chief of the Fair Open Access journal Glossa Psycholinguistics. She is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Cognitive Science Society, the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and the Association for Psychological Science (APS). Dr. Ferreira’s area of research is psycholinguistics. She uses basic insights from formal linguistics, especially theories in sentence phonology and syntax, to develop models of processing. The fundamental aim of her research is to uncover the mechanisms that enable humans to understand and generate language in real-time and in cooperation with other cognitive systems.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about the questions Dr. Ferreira focuses the most on. We then go through topics like the mechanisms that enable humans to understand and generate language in real-time; how the position of modifiers in English influences how words are processed; speech disfluencies, and how comprehenders deal with them; how often comprehenders misinterpret language; whether there is a relationship between fluency and intelligence; the role of redundancy in comprehension; the study of reading and information processing through eye-tracking; and language learning.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> The questions Dr. Ferreiras focuses on  \n<time>04:16</time> Mechanisms that enable humans to understand and generate language in real time  \n<time>08:50</time> How the position of modifiers in English influences how words are processed  \n<time>18:18</time> Speech disfluencies, and how comprehenders deal with them  \n<time>29:33</time> Do disfluencies always point to cognitive issues?  \n<time>35:56</time> How often do comprehenders misinterpret language?  \n<time>47:15</time> Does fluency of language production have any relationship with differences in intelligence?  \n<time>50:03</time> The role of redundancy in comprehension  \n<time>56:18</time> The study of reading and information processing through eye-tracking  \n<time>1:01:06</time> Language learning  \n<time>1:05:17</time> Follow Dr. Ferreira’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ferreira’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/47IOEaV  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3sp80Bz\n",
