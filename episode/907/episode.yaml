  \ candidate in the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University.\
  \ Her main research interest is responsibility. She investigates how people ascribe\
  \ responsibility for good and bad outcomes across various situations. She is specifically\
  \ interested in epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance. We start by discussing\
  \ how to approach responsibility from the perspective of psychology/cognitive science,\
  \ and when exactly people ascribe responsibility to others. We talk about epistemic\
  \ responsibility, what happens when people lack relevant information, if the effort\
  \ put into acquiring it matters, and if outcomes matter. Finally, we discuss strategic\
  \ ignorance, and focus on health-related examples, particularly testing for STIs.\n\
