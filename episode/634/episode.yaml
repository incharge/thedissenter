  \ of Biology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the head of the Swarm\
  \ Lab, an interdisciplinary research lab that studies the mechanisms underlying\
  \ Collective Behaviors and Swarm Intelligence in natural and artificial systems\
  \ (http://www.theswarmlab.com). His research aims to reveal the detailed functioning\
  \ of collective intelligence in systems as diverse as ant colonies, human crowds\
  \ or robotic swarms.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about swarm intelligence. Topics\
  \ include: examples of swarm intelligence in biological systems; collective decision-making;\
  \ aggregation behavior; information; decision-making without brains or nervous systems,\
  \ and embodied cognition; human crowds and collective intelligence; and phenomena\
  \ that we could get a better grasp of through swarm intelligence, like human crowd\
  \ motion, politics, and culture.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n\
