He draws on multiple approaches from across the sciences and humanities, to study the origins, development, and maintenance of (non)religious worldviews. His research focuses on three areas: Identifying and measuring components of nonreligious worldviews; computer simulated models of the cognitive and social dynamics leading to (non)belief in supernatural agents; investigating how and why moral motivations are stereotypically attributed to religious, as opposed to nonreligious factors.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology of believes and nonbelievers. We start with some of the psychological differences between religious people and atheists. We deal with the case of agnosticism. We discuss phenomena like absorption and mentalizing. We talk about worldviews, and fatalism and nihilism. We also go through what we can learn from pilgrimage studies, the four different kinds of religious orientation, and where atheist derive value and meaning from. Toward the end, we discuss the evolutionary bases of atheism, and Thomas tells us about a Postdoc project he is part of: Religion, Ideology & Prosociality: Simulating Secularising Societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:06</time> The psychological differences between religious people and atheists  \n<time>04:43</time> Agnosticism  \n<time>07:00</time> Religious beliefs  \n<time>15:02</time> Are atheists undogmatic?  \n<time>22:17</time> Absorption and mysticism  \n<time>27:44</time> Worldviews, fatalism and nihilism  \n<time>38:34</time> Motivations behind pilgrimage  \n<time>46:06</time> Different kinds of religious orientation  \n<time>53:31</time> Value and meaning  \n<time>1:03:14</time> The evolutionary bases of atheism  \n<time>1:15:42</time> Religion, Ideology & Prosociality: Simulating Secularising Societies  \n<time>1:18:50</time> Follow Thomas’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Thomas’ work:  \nCoventry page: https://bit.ly/3m3S3YJ  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3oGoApy  \nSociety and Cognition Unit: https://bit.ly/376IkMM  \nThe RIP project https://bit.ly/341reOG  \nResearchGate page: https://bit.ly/2KdOXUx\n",
