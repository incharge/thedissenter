shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 27th 2021.  \nDr. David Lewis is Senior Lecturer in Social\
  \ Psychology at Murdoch University. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about personality,\
  \ friendship, and attractiveness from an evolutionary perspective. We start with\
  \ personality, and ask how we should understand it from an evolutionary standpoint,\
  \ and discuss if there is a personality inventory that would make more sense evolutionarily-speaking.\
  \ We also discuss if personality traits are adaptations. We talk about the condition-dependent\
  \ model of individual differences. We then get into friendship, and discuss it as\
  \ an evolved phenomenon, same-sex and opposite-sex friendships, the phenomenon of\
  \ friends with benefits, and the relationships straight women establish with gay\
  \ men. Finally, we discuss several aspects of physical attractiveness, including\
  \ symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, neotenous facial features, eyes, lumbar curvature,\
  \ and the effects of wearing high heels. We wrap things up with what we get from\
  \ studying attractiveness through dating apps.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
