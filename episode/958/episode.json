	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 24th 2024.  \nDr. Robert McKenna is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Liverpool. Most of his work is in epistemology, but he is also interested in philosophy of language, philosophy of science and ethics. Within epistemology, he is increasingly interested in applied epistemology, feminist epistemology and social epistemology more broadly. Current topics of interest include the epistemology of persuasion, the epistemology of climate change denial (and of \"dysfunctional epistemologies\" more broadly), epistemic injustice and social constructivism. He is the author of Non-Ideal Epistemology.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Non-Ideal Epistemology. We first discuss ideal epistemology, and then get into what non-ideal epistemology is. We talk about its ethical and political aspects, the example of feminist epistemology, and epistemic agents as deeply socially situated. We address the problem of the identification of expertise, and intellectual autonomy. We discuss how we can construct a better epistemic environment. We talk about how we can deal with public ignorance about important political and scientific issues. We discuss our responsibilities as inquirers, and how they depend on our social situation. Finally, we talk about motivated reasoning and skepticism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:44</time> Ideal epistemology  \n<time>06:02</time> Non-ideal epistemology  \n<time>11:18</time> Non-ideal epistemology as explicitly ethical and political  \n<time>12:58</time> The example of feminist epistemology  \n<time>16:10</time> Epistemic agents as deeply socially situated  \n<time>19:31</time> The identification of expertise, and intellectual autonomy  \n<time>28:52</time> Constructing a better epistemic environment  \n<time>33:21</time> Public ignorance about important political and scientific issues  \n<time>37:38</time> Our responsibilities as inquirers  \n<time>47:14</time> Motivated reasoning and skepticism  \n<time>56:30</time> Follow Dr. McKenna\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. McKenna\u2019s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3PxZt7r  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3Pv9GS3  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/46scxSB  \nNon-Ideal Epistemology: https://bit.ly/3PqIBPT\n",
