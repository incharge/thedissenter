  \ Philosophy at the University of Birmingham, affiliated with the Philosophy Department\
  \ in the School of Philosophy, Theology, and Religion; and with the Institute for\
  \ Mental Health in the School of Psychology. Her research is in the philosophy of\
  \ the cognitive sciences. She writes about the limitations of human cognition and\
  \ human agency, investigating faulty reasoning and irrational beliefs, delusions,\
  \ confabulations, distorted memories, poor knowledge of the self, unreliable self-narratives,\
  \ self-deception, inconsistencies between attitudes and behavior, unrealistic optimism,\
  \ and other positive illusions. She is also interested in the philosophy of medicine\
  \ and how health, wellbeing, rationality, and agency interact. She is the author\
  \ of The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs. We start with some basic\
  \ concepts, like \u201Cirrational beliefs\u201D, \u201Cepistemic irrationality\u201D\
  , \u201Cepistemics functionality\u201D, and \u201Cepistemic innocence\u201D, and\
  \ we apply them to a philosophical and scientific context. We go through some examples\
  \ where epistemic innocence applies, like self-narratives, optimism and pessimism,\
  \ mental disorders, romantic relationships, and religious beliefs. Finally, we discuss\
  \ how the epistemic innocence project might apply in a clinical context, and in\
  \ understanding how our normal cognition works.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:41</time>\
