  \ writing is honest and truthful; how writing fiction can help you understand different\
  \ people and their personalities; the horror genre, Ingmar Bergman, and the fear\
  \ of estrangement; what it\u2019s like living with depression; the importance of\
  \ romantic relationships; Victoria\u2019s influences in her writing; the limitations\
  \ of writing in comparison to other arts; how comic books can be so great; and how\
  \ we always get boring parts in stories; and why I only write when I\u2019m in love.\n\
