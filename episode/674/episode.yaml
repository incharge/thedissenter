excerpt: Dr. Bianca Acevedo is an Instructor at New York University. She is a social
  neuroscientist whose research focuses on the neural basis of attachment, caregiving,
  sensory processing sensitivity (and related disorders), and mind-body interventions.
  She conducted the first neuroimaging studies of long-term pair-bonding in humans
  for which she was awarded the 2012 International Women in Science Award. She joined
  the NRI in 2016 where she has been examining empathy in caregivers of ADRD individuals.
  Dr. Acevedo is interested in understanding the biological basis of human attachment
  and sensory processing sensitivity. In addition, her research examines the neural
  and behavioral outcomes associated with engaging in mind-body practices in clinical
  and normative individuals and dyads.

  \ and dyads.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about attachment from a neuroscientific\
  \ perspective. We get into romantic love, and relationship satisfaction. We discuss\
  \ sensory processing sensitivity, and its relationship with mental disorders like\
  \ depression. Finally, we talk about social neuroscience, and how social psychology\
  \ intersects with neuroscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:29</time>\
