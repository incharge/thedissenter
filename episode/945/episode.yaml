  \ and how old it is in academia. We talk about how teaching and learning occur online,\
  \ what predicts the success of e-mentoring, and the advantages and disadvantages\
  \ of e-mentoring. We also talk about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on e-mentoring\
  \ and how it is studied. Finally, we discuss some of the biggest barriers to students\u2019\
  \ success, including food and housing insecurity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
