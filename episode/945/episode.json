We talk about what it is, and how old it is in academia. We talk about how teaching and learning occur online, what predicts the success of e-mentoring, and the advantages and disadvantages of e-mentoring. We also talk about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on e-mentoring and how it is studied. Finally, we discuss some of the biggest barriers to students’ success, including food and housing insecurity.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:54</time> What is e-mentoring?  \n<time>05:52</time> How old is e-mentoring in academia?  \n<time>08:08</time> How teaching and learning occur online  \n<time>17:18</time> What predicts the success of e-mentoring  \n<time>28:31</time> The advantages and disadvantages of e-mentoring  \n<time>34:31</time> The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on e-mentoring and how it is studied  \n<time>41:45</time> Barriers to students’ success, like food and housing insecurity  \n<time>49:22</time> Follow Dr. Baciu’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Baciu’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3ITzgyk  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3kpx3Ay  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3GI7vWA  \nTwitter handle: @CristinaCBaciu\n",
