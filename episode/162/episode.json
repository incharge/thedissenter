Dr. Goff also has a sideline in political philosophy, focusing on issues pertaining to taxation, globalization and social justice. He’s also the author of the book Consciousness and Fundamental Reality.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about consciousness, materialism and the nature of reality. We start off by discussing the philosophy of materialism and its limitations when it comes to account for phenomena like consciousness. We also talk about illusionism as a theory of consciousness, and the difficulties in trying to understand consciousness from an objectivist perspective, and the inherent limitations that our theory of mind has. Then, Dr. Goff explains his approach to consciousness, and what he thinks is the best way to know its nature, based on Russellian monism and panpsychism. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:53</time> The philosophy of materialism, and what might be some of its limitations  \n<time>08:51</time> Causal relationships vs. the nature of the Universe                                  \n<time>11:47</time> Mind-brain dualism       \n<time>14:08</time> Phenomenal consciousness, and the hard problem                  \n<time>15:27</time> On Illusionism               \n<time>19:36</time> Does it matter if our intuitions about the mind are wrong?                   \n<time>21:50</time> Dr. Goff’s approach to consciousness, and Russellian monism             \n<time>25:58</time> About panpsychism     \n<time>28:41</time> How would we know what consciousness is?    \n<time>33:31</time> Individual variation of conscious experience, and issues about subjectivism    \n<time>49:18</time> Consciousness, the external world, and our cognitive/epistemological limitations         \n<time>52:54</time> Follow Dr. Goff’s work!      \n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Crawford’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/y54hnlcf  \nPersonal Website: https://tinyurl.com/yyfc6lkm  \nConscious and Consciousness Blog: https://tinyurl.com/y5hujegs  \nConsciousness and Fundamental Reality Book: https://tinyurl.com/y48f5y5r  \nTwitter handle: @Philip_Goff\n\nSome relevant links:  \nRussellian monism: https://tinyurl.com/y6qsb989 / https://tinyurl.com/yyuft4pp  \nMaterialism (philosophy): https://tinyurl.com/mqsundk  \nInterview w/ Dr. Keith Frankish: https://youtu.be/uXeqm2d1djo\n",
