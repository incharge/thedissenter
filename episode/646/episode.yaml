shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 7th 2022.  \nDr. Russ Shafer-Landau is Professor of\
  \ Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His primary interest is in\
  \ ethics. He is the author of Moral Realism: A Defence (Oxford 2003), Whatever Happened\
  \ to Good and Evil? (Oxford 2004), and The Fundamentals of Ethics (Oxford 2010).\
  \ He is the editor of Oxford Studies in Metaethics, and is the founder and organizer\
  \ of the annual Madison Metaethics Workshop (MadMeta). He is also the director of\
  \ the Marc Sanders Prize in Metaethics. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about metaethics,\
  \ and moral realism. We ask what is metaethics, and define moral realism. We go\
  \ through several challenges to moral realism, like evolutionary debunking arguments,\
  \ apparent moral variation across cultures, moral foundations theory, and arguments\
  \ from disagreement. We discuss if and how we can know that an epistemological approach\
  \ is the best one out there. Finally, we talk about where moral beliefs come from,\
  \ and the implications that might have for how moral philosophers do their work.\n\
