shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 28th 2023.  \nDr. Merlijn Olthof is a Post-Doc in\
  \ Tipping points in Treatment at the University of Groningen, and Lecturer in Pedagogical\
  \ Sciences at Radboud University. His work focuses on complex systems, clinical\
  \ psychology, developmental psychopathology, and related topics.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about a complex systems approach to psychopathology. We first talk about\
  \ the study of behavioral variability within individuals, and some conceptual foundations\
  \ of a complex systems approach to psychopathology, like critical fluctuations,\
  \ destabilization, and order transitions. We discuss the study of early warning\
  \ signals, and some of its limitations. We talk about large shifts in symptom severity.\
  \ We discuss the differences between group-based \u201Cdisease models\u201D and\
  \ personalized approaches inspired by complex systems theory. We talk about psychopathology\
  \ as emergent and self-organized. Finally, we discuss implications for the classification\
  \ of mental disorders and public health.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:40\
