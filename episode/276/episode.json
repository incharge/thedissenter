shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 21st, 2019.  \nDr. Daniel Everett is Trustee Professor\
  \ of Cognitive Sciences at Bentley University. He holds a ScD and a Masters of Linguistics\
  \ from the Universidade Estadual in Campinas (UNICAMP). He is well-known for his\
  \ many years of field research among the Pirah\xE3 people of the Brazilian Amazon\
  \ jungle. Dr. Everett's books include Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated\
  \ Unconscious, and How Language Began: The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about linguistics, and the Pirah\xE3. First, Dr. Everett\
  \ distinguishes between communication and language. He also refers to issues with\
  \ Universal Grammar, and gives us his account of why H. erectus should have been\
  \ the first hominin to have language. We talk about the biological tools needed\
  \ for language, and the limitations in other primates\u2019 use of sign language.\
  \ We refer to three different types of language (G1, G2, and G3), cultural evolution,\
  \ the universal traits of language, and difficulties in distinguishing between different\
  \ languages. We discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and if there is evidence that\
  \ language influences thinking. Finally, in the last ten minutes, Dr. Everett talks\
  \ about the Pirah\xE3 society, their culture and language.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:45</time>\
