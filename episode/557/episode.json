The question that drives most his research is: what supports the remarkable capacity for human self-awareness? To address this question, he combines experimental and theoretical approaches (psychophysics, computational modelling, neuroimaging) to understand how people become self-aware of aspects of their cognition and behavior (such as perception, memory and decision-making), and why such awareness is often impaired in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Current interests focus on understanding contributions of human prefrontal cortex to metacognition, and how self-awareness and social cognition may share a core neurocomputational basis. He is the author of Know Thyself: The New Science of Self-Awareness.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Know Thyself. We start by discussing what self-awareness is, its components, and the sorts of mental tasks associated with it. We discuss the evolutionary rationale for it. We talk about individual differences in self-awareness, and ask if it is possible to improve it. We discuss how self-awareness might interfere with performance, and if experts are good at explaining how they do things. We talk about how knowledge about metacognition might improve learning and decision-making. We discuss how a lack of metacognition correlates with more extreme political attitudes. We talk about how self-awareness can promote social cooperation. Finally, we discuss if we should delegate decisions to AI systems, their limitations, and if they could become self-aware.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> What is self-awareness?  \n<time>10:28</time> The evolution of self-awareness  \n<time>21:50</time> Individual differences in self-awareness, and how to improve it  \n<time>31:58</time> Self-awareness, expertise, and performance  \n<time>40:17</time> Learning, and decision-making  \n<time>47:09</time> Lack of metacognition and political extremism  \n<time>48:34</time> Social cooperation  \n<time>52:12</time> Self-awareness in AI  \n<time>1:12:58</time> Follow Dr. Fleming’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Fleming’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3sjYiKY  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3AGXWmc  \nKnow Thyself: https://amzn.to/3tkl5YB  \nTwitter handle: @smfleming\n",
