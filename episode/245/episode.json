We talk about some of the most well-established mate preferences. We then get into how people choose mates based on these same preferences, and we focus mostly on Euclidian algorithms, as explored by Dr. Conroy-Beam in his work, and all of the phenomena that we are able to study and understand through them. We specifically address things like relationship satisfaction, mate switching, and mate retention tactics. We also talk about studying sex differences using multivariate analyses, opposite-sex friendships, and mysteries in human mating that we have yet to answer. We end up by talking about some limitations in traditional evolutionary psychology, and how things are expected to progress in the near future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:03</time> What we know about human mate preferences  \n<time>08:29</time> Understanding how people really choose mates  \n<time>12:09</time> Euclidian algorithms  \n<time>17:33</time> People calibrate their mate preferences  \n<time>19:36</time> Mate value discrepancies and relationship satisfaction  \n<time>21:51</time> Mate switching  \n<time>26:45</time> Mate retention tactics  \n<time>30:34</time> Studying sex differences with multivariate analyses  \n<time>34:54</time> Opposite-sex friendships  \n<time>42:21</time> Mysteries of human mating  \n<time>48:19</time> More progress in evolutionary psychology and the behavioral sciences  \n<time>59:47</time> Follow Dr. Conroy-Beam’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Conroy-Beam’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2Z5cWvP  \nPersonal website: http://bit.ly/2NjYCZq  \nArticles on Researchgate: http://bit.ly/2PlP5nt\n\nRelevant papers:  \nMate Preferences: http://bit.ly/33Oyv2E  \nDo Mate Preferences Influence Actual Mating Decisions?: http://bit.ly/2Z4nGuE  \nEuclidean distances discriminatively predict short-term and long-term attraction to potential mates: http://bit.ly/30p5msE  \nEuclidean Mate Value and Power of Choice on the Mating Market: http://bit.ly/2HgrOwA  \nFriends with Benefits: The Evolved Psychology of Same- and Opposite-Sex Friendship: http://bit.ly/2zeZ9mY  \nHow Sexually Dimorphic Are Human Mate Preferences?: http://bit.ly/2MpCjBT  \nThe mate switching hypothesis: http://bit.ly/2ZklH4y  \nWhat predicts romantic relationship satisfaction and mate retention intensity: mate preference fulfillment or mate value discrepancies?: http://bit.ly/2Z9UuSf\n",
