  \ in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. His research interests\
  \ include: evolutionary psychology, evolution of sociality, psychology of cooperation\
  \ and punishment, ecological rationality, and psychology of foraging. Dr. Krasnow\u2019\
  s primary line of research focuses on the evolutionary origins and computational\
  \ design of the mechanisms underlying human cooperation and social behavior. Why\
  \ are we more generous, trusting and cooperative, but also vengeful and punitive\
  \ than an otherwise rational analysis would predict? He has been exploring how the\
  \ answers to these questions neatly fall out by considering reliable features of\
  \ the ancestral ecology and simple cognitive mechanisms that could evolve to benefit\
  \ from them.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about different aspects of human sociality.\
  \ We first discuss how we evolved to be so generous, trusting and cooperative. We\
  \ address the different types of natural selection, namely, sexual selection and\
  \ social selection, and also if we need group selection to explain things like strong\
  \ reciprocity. We then talk about uncertainty in human interactions, and why we\
  \ cooperate in one-shot interactions. We refer to the social role of vengeance and\
  \ punishment; the evolution of honesty; the importance of social reputation; and\
  \ how deterrence works in human societies. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:01</time>\
