shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 15th 2023.  \nDr. Anthony Volk is Professor in the\
  \ Department of Child and Youth Studies, and Associate Member in the Department\
  \ of Psychology at Brock University. He is a developmental scientist interested\
  \ in the separate, but related, areas of bullying, parenting, personality, psychopathy,\
  \ and the evolution of childhood. A strong believer in multidisciplinary studies,\
  \ Prof. Volk\u2019s overall interest is to gain an evolutionary, psychological,\
  \ biological, neurological, health-based, Indigenous, cross-cultural, social, historical,\
  \ and (if possible) transdisciplinary understanding of why individuals do what they\
  \ do.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about bullying from an evolutionary and developmental\
  \ perspective. We discuss adolescent bullying, and how it differs from bullying\
  \ in other stages of life. We talk about the personality traits of bullies; the\
  \ evolutionary advantages of bullying; imbalances of power; who the victims of bullying\
  \ are; psychopathy and psychopathology in bullying; whether the way schools are\
  \ structured contributes to bullying; when and why people intervene in bullying\
  \ incidents; interventions to reduce bullying; and classroom incivility. Finally,\
  \ Dr. Volk answers questions from a patron regarding life history theory.\n\nTime\
