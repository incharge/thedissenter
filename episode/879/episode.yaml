excerpt: Dr. James Lee is Associate Professor of Psychology, and a member of the Graduate
  Faculty of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Minnesota.
  In 2012, Dr. Lee earned a Ph.D. from the Department of Psychology at Harvard University.
  The papers collected in his dissertation cover causal inference, genome-wide association
  studies, and cognitive-experimental approaches to the study of individual differences.
  He was a postdoctoral researcher in the Mathematical Biology Section of NIDDK/NIH

  \ of Psychology, and a member of the Graduate Faculty of Bioinformatics and Computational\
  \ Biology at the University of Minnesota. In 2012, Dr. Lee earned a Ph.D. from the\
  \ Department of Psychology at Harvard University. The papers collected in his dissertation\

  \ in the Mathematical Biology Section of NIDDK/NIH from 2011 to 2013, working on\
  \ problems in population and statistical genetics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ behavior genetics. We discuss genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and what\
  \ we can learn from them. We talk about the concept of heritability. We go through\
  \ traits like educational attainment, IQ, and alcohol and tobacco use. We talk about\
  \ laypeople\u2019s beliefs about the heritability of behavior. Finally, Dr. Lee\
  \ answers two questions from a patron of the show, about modern education, and causality\
  \ in behavior genetics.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:36  Genome-wide association\
