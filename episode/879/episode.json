In 2012, Dr. Lee earned a Ph.D. from the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. The papers collected in his dissertation cover causal inference, genome-wide association studies, and cognitive-experimental approaches to the study of individual differences. He was a postdoctoral researcher in the Mathematical Biology Section of NIDDK/NIH from 2011 to 2013, working on problems in population and statistical genetics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about behavior genetics. We discuss genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and what we can learn from them. We talk about the concept of heritability. We go through traits like educational attainment, IQ, and alcohol and tobacco use. We talk about laypeople’s beliefs about the heritability of behavior. Finally, Dr. Lee answers two questions from a patron of the show, about modern education, and causality in behavior genetics.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> Genome-wide association studies  \n<time>08:04</time> The concept of heritability  \n<time>10:41</time> Educational attainment  \n<time>22:20</time> The heritability of IQ  \n<time>30:28</time> Alcohol and tobacco use  \n<time>40:49</time> Laypeople’s beliefs about the heritability of behavior  \n<time>47:54</time> Two questions from a patron  \n<time>1:05:53</time> Follow Dr. Lee’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Lee’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/43LCfku  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/43MVVEH\n",
