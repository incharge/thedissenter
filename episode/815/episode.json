You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/L7R-EKiYWNQ\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about the study of human demography, and what we can learn from it. We discuss the myth of the nuclear family as the traditional family structure, child rearing in traditional societies, if children really need a parent from each sex at home, if father absence leads to poverty, and the negative effects of this myth on children and parents. We talk about how gendered division of labor develops in human societies. We discuss life history theory, and issues in how it has been applied to humans. We talk about the strengths of the evolutionary social sciences, and criticisms of the evolutionary social sciences, with a focus on evolutionary psychology. We discuss the ties between the study of human demography and the eugenics movement, and the recent academic resurgence of eugenics. Finally, we discuss issues with the national IQ datasets created by Richard Lynn, and ideas surrounding sex differences and representativeness in academia.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> Studying human demography, and what we can learn from it  \n<time>05:44</time> The myth of the nuclear family  \n<time>10:36</time> Child rearing in traditional societies  \n<time>12:42</time> Do children need a parent of each sex at home?  \n<time>15:29</time> Does father absence lead to poverty?  \n<time>17:20</time> Can the myth of the nuclear family have negative effects on children and parents?  \n<time>20:53</time> How gendered division of labor develops in human societies  \n<time>26:36</time> Life history theory, and how it has been applied to humans  \n<time>36:48</time> The strengths of the evolutionary social sciences  \n<time>38:28</time> Criticisms of the evolutionary social sciences  \n<time>50:57</time> Human demography and the eugenics movements  \n<time>52:59</time> The recent academic resurgence of eugenics  \n<time>1:01:37</time> Issues with national IQ datasets  \n<time>1:09:05</time> Sex differences and representativeness in academia  \n<time>1:13:53</time> Follow Dr. Sear’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Sear’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/41bCFxK  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/429jHtf  \nTwitter handle: @RebeccaSear\n",
