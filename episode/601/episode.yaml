shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 7th 2021.  \nDr. Henrik H\xF8gh-Olesen is Professor\
  \ of Psychology at Aarhus University. His research interests include Evolutionary\
  \ psychology, Comparative psychology/Ethology, Primatology, Aesthetics, Psychology\
  \ of religion, and History of psychology. He is the author of 13 scientific books,\
  \ including The Aesthetic Animal.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Aesthetic\
  \ Animal. We talk about the aesthetic impulse, and the evolution of art and aesthetic\
  \ appreciation. We also discuss individual differences in art appreciation. We go\
  \ through the evolution and social functions of body ornamentation, song, dance,\
  \ music, and fiction. We talk a bit about the neuroscience of aesthetics, and the\
  \ role existential uncertainty might play in art production. Finally, we talk about\
  \ how we can improve human wellbeing by learning more about our \u201Caesthetic\
  \ impulse\u201D, mostly through architecture.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
