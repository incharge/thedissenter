  \ THE RECORDING PROGRAM THAT I HOPE TO SOLVE DEFINITELLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. PLEASE\
  \ ENJOY!\n\nDr. Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor in Social and Decision Sciences\
  \ at Carnegie Mellon University, and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.\
  \ He also runs the Laboratory for Social Minds, were he and his team undertake empirical\
  \ investigations, and build mathematical theories, of both historical and contemporary\
  \ phenomena.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the ways we can apply knowledge and\
  \ mathematical models from Physics to the study of human social behavior and cultural\
  \ evolution. We also deal with the philosophical issue of emergentism vs reductionism.\
