	"shownotes": "RECORDED ON JANUARY 17th 2024.  \nDr. Jonathan Matheson is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Florida specializing in epistemology. His primary research interests concern the epistemic significance of disagreement.  He also has research interests in ethics, metaphysics, and philosophy of religion. His latest book is Why It's OK Not to Think for Yourself.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Why It\u2019s OK Not to Think for Yourself. We start by discussing where the idea that people should think for themselves comes from, and social epistemology and the wisdom of crowds. We talk about who we should rely on, how to identify the experts, why we cannot properly evaluate all kinds of information by ourselves, and how we need to rely on other people and on accumulated knowledge. We go through the main objections to Dr. Matheson\u2019s thesis, namely the autonomy objection, the free-rider objection, the Socratic objection, the objection of epistemic vulnerability, the understanding objection, and the intellectual virtue objection. Finally, we discuss epistemic responsibility, and cases where it is not OK to not think for yourself.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:27</time> Where the idea that people should think for themselves comes from  \n<time>06:42</time> Social epistemology  \n<time>08:39</time> The wisdom of crowds  \n<time>10:51</time> Who should we rely on?  \n<time>13:17</time> Can we properly evaluate all kinds of information by ourselves?  \n<time>16:56</time> Identifying the experts  \n<time>27:42</time> Relying on other people and on accumulated knowledge  \n<time>30:10</time> The autonomy objection  \n<time>37:09</time> The free-rider objection  \n<time>42:53</time> The Socratic objection  \n<time>47:28</time> Epistemic vulnerability  \n<time>51:19</time> The understanding objection  \n<time>55:15</time> Intellectual virtues  \n<time>1:04:41</time> Epistemic responsibility  \n<time>1:10:04</time> Cases where it is not OK to not think for yourself  \n<time>1:13:08</time> Follow Dr. Matheson\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Matheson\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3RFniMW  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3rrpa1f  \nWhy It's OK Not to Think for Yourself: https://bit.ly/49o3X9B\n",
