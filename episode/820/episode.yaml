excerpt: 'Dr. Joseph Errington is Professor of Anthropology at Yale University. He
  studies language change as a source of insight into the ways languages constitute
  intimate parts of our everyday lives, and at the same time are foundational for
  large-scale institutions, social groups, and social dynamics. He has worked mostly
  in Indonesia, studying Javanese (90 million speakers), Indonesian (250 million speakers)
  and a range of Malay dialects. He has also worked on questions of language ideology
  and practice: how conceptions of language can shape and reflect social interests,
  naturalize images of social groups, and shape everyday ways of talking. He is the
  author of books like Language and Social Change in Java, Shifting Languages, and
  Linguistics in a Colonial World.'

  \ at Yale University. He studies language change as a source of insight into the\
  \ ways languages constitute intimate parts of our everyday lives, and at the same\
  \ time are foundational for large-scale institutions, social groups, and social\
  \ dynamics. He has worked mostly in Indonesia, studying Javanese (90 million speakers),\
  \ Indonesian (250 million speakers) and a range of Malay dialects. He has also worked\
  \ on questions of language ideology and practice: how conceptions of language can\
  \ shape and reflect social interests, naturalize images of social groups, and shape\
  \ everyday ways of talking. He is the author of books like Language and Social Change\
  \ in Java, Shifting Languages, and Linguistics in a Colonial World.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about some topics in linguistics. We discuss language ideologies. We talk\
  \ about the history of linguistics, and its ties to colonialism, including the invention\
  \ of hierarchies of languages; stripping languages off their sociocultural context,\
  \ and issues with the Universal Grammar approach; imposing written forms on languages;\
  \ reducing languages to the versions used by social elites; and the invention of\
  \ national languages. We also discuss misconceptions about non-standard versions\
  \ of languages; threats to marginalized languages and their communities; and how\
  \ these issues manifest on the Javanese and the Indonesian language.\n\nTime Links:\
