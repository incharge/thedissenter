His scientific interests concern the evolution and the dynamics of extinction of animal species, and in particular the fossils of hominid species. His most notable scientific contributions regard evolutionary theories about the evolution of insular species, the complexity of organisms, and the dynamics of extinction of hominids.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about climate change as a factor in evolution, and what drives the extinction of species. We discuss how increased specialization can be a problem. We get into how climate change impacted the evolution of hominins. We talk about why Neanderthals went extinct and H. sapiens survived, and how similar their cognitive ability was. We discuss how H. sapiens was able to increase its habitable area. We talk about what drove the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. Finally, we discuss the relationship between morphological integration and functional performance, and how it influences evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> Climate change as a factor in evolution  \n<time>03:09</time> What drives the extinction of species  \n<time>04:52</time> How increased specialization can be a problem  \n<time>06:53</time> How climate change impacted the evolution of hominins  \n<time>10:24</time> Why Neanderthals went extinct and H. sapiens survived  \n<time>15:21</time> Cerebral cortex integration in Neanderthals and H. sapiens, and their cognitive ability  \n<time>23:48</time> Culture and nice construction, and how H. sapiens increased its habitable area  \n<time>27:06</time> What drove the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna  \n<time>31:19</time> The relationship between morphological integration and functional performance, and how it influences evolution  \n<time>37:55</time> Follow Dr. Raia’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Raia’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3gTWsAl  \nRaia’s Lab: https://bit.ly/3C7kpfx  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3sHohP4\n",
