She received her PhD in Social Psychology from Florida State University under Dr. Roy Baumeister and Dr. Jon Maner. Her research examines how pressure to compete for social and romantic partners asymmetrically affects the competitive behaviors and well-being of men and women. Through a joint appointment with the Gender Studies department, Dr. Reynolds offers courses on human sexuality and sex/gender differences. As a collaborative research team with Justin Garcia and Amanda Gesselman, she hopes to examine the dispositional predictors and physiological correlates of individuals’ romantic relationship experiences, as well as how these associations may differ across gender and sexual orientation.\n\nIn this episode, we go through several topics of Dr. Reynolds’ research. We first talk about how men and women’s mate preferences influence their intrasexual and intersexual social dynamics. We also refer to friendships, focusing more on same-sex friendships. We discuss a paper about human patrilocality and how women needed to establish same-sex friendships with non-kin women during our evolution, and how self-deception might have played a role in intrasexual competition. We talk about sexual economics theory applied to mating contests, and also how men use romantic partners as social signals to other men. We also discuss a little bit the evolution of personality traits, before getting into gender bias in moral typecasting. Finally, we explore the topic of the problems in the workplace and science production that might stem from a culture of victim sanctification and harm-avoidance.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:27</time> Going from mate preferences to social dynamics  \n<time>10:35</time> Social pressures to acquire mates (friends)  \n<time>21:32</time> Female intrasexual competition and self-deception  \n<time>32:34</time> Applying Sexual Economics Theory to Mating Contests  \n<time>40:03</time> Romantic Partners Function as Social Signals  \n<time>46:35</time> The evolution of personality traits  \n<time>56:36</time> Gender bias in moral typecasting  \n<time>1:03:46</time> Challenging Victim Sanctification in Era of Harm-Avoidance  \n<time>1:23:49</time> The dangers of “concept creeping” harm  \n<time>1:32:02</time> Follow Dr. Reynolds’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Reynolds’ work:  \nWebpage at the Kinsey Institute: http://bit.ly/2ZgqTDc  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2LHXWgj  \nTwitter handle: @TaniaArline  \nGender bias in moral typecasting (YouTube): http://bit.ly/2mzYvxn\n\nRelevant papers:  \nCompeting for Love: Applying Sexual Economics Theory to Mating Contests: http://bit.ly/2mhaYpv  \nOne’s Better Half: Romantic Partners Function as Social Signals: https://fla.st/2kGp57F  \nOur grandmothers’ legacy: Challenges faced by female ancestors leave traces in modern women’s same-sex relationships (to be published)  \nChallenging Victim Sanctification in Era of Harm-Avoidance: Allegations, Taboos, and Implications for Management (to be published)\n",
