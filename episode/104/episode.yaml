  \ this episode, we talk about the scientific and philosophical revolution operated\
  \ by Darwinism, and the many beliefs that it undermined. We go through how natural\
  \ selection works; gene-culture coevolution; what are the units of selection in\
  \ evolution; the concept of species; race and its biological basis; the problems\
  \ with genetic engineering; and the schism between science and religion.\n\nTime\
