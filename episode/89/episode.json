  \ books, including The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ start off by talking about some of the main subjects covered by Dr. Saad\u2019\
  s work. First, I ask him to tell us why he decided to apply evolutionary theory\
  \ to consumer behavior. We then move on to talk about cultural artifacts as fossils\
  \ of the human mind, the four great cognitive pillars of consumer behavior, and\
  \ why some people have addictive behaviors. After I ask him if he has sold his soul\
  \ to the capitalist devil, we talk about the many ways intellectual terrorists try\
  \ to butcher evolutionary psychology, the entire field of Psychology, and even science\
  \ itself as an intellectual enterprise. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>02:09</time> How\
