shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 7th 2023.  \nDr. Agust\xEDn Fuentes is Professor\
  \ of Anthropology at Princeton University. His research focuses on the biosocial,\
  \ delving into the entanglement of biological systems with the social and cultural\
  \ lives of humans, our ancestors, and a few of the other animals with whom humanity\
  \ shares close relations. Dr. Fuentes was awarded the Inaugural Communication &\
  \ Outreach Award from the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, the\
  \ President\u2019s Award from the American Anthropological Association, and elected\
  \ to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of books like Race,\
  \ Monogamy, and Other Lies They Told You: Busting Myths about Human Nature, and\
  \ Why We Believe: Evolution and the Human Way of Being.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about the origins of patriarchy. We start by defining patriarchy, and talk about\
  \ how long it has existed for. We talk about the idea of the \u201Cnaturalness\u201D\
  \ of patriarchy, and we discuss the different sources of evidence used to support\
  \ it, including animal models; the \u201Cnuclear family\u201D, and cooperative breeding;\
  \ pair bonding and mating systems; polygamy; morphological correlates of male dominance;\
  \ and sex differences in tool making and use. We talk about what might be the best\
  \ explanations for the origins of patriarchy. Finally, we discuss how scientists\
  \ are influenced by their own (political) values.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
