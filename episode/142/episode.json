  \ at the University of Utah. His research focuses largely on the philosophy of science\

  \ of the book Beyond Versus: The Struggle to Understand the Interaction of Nature\
  \ and Nurture.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Tabery\u2019\
  s book, Beyond Versus. We go through the historical origins of the nature-nurture\
  \ debate, and the early stages of Biology, and the influences of genetics and the\
  \ study of development. Then, we address the complexity of the interaction between\
  \ genes and the environment, and how they mediate each other\u2019s effects on the\
  \ organism. And we finish up with a couple of questions about the ethical implications\
  \ of this science, including the dangers of focusing too much on nature, or believing\
  \ in extreme environmentalism and views of the mind as a blank slate, and also the\
  \ technical and ethical limitations to gene editing, human enhancement and eugenics.\n\
