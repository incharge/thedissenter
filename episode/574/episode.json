We talk about how complicated it is to draw inferences about people’s political preferences and behavior from digital data, and how digital media have changed how political campaigns are done. We focus a lot on Twitter as a platform for research on politics. We also discuss the impact of online misinformation. We wrap things up with a positive evidence-based message for people who want to navigate the digital world without becoming cynical.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:50</time> Do social media change political discourse?  \n<time>13:51</time> Have social media changed how politics is done?  \n<time>19:56</time> Do online political ads and campaigns work?  \n<time>25:02</time> Can we know people’s political preferences by studying their online behavior?  \n<time>31:14</time> Twitter as a platform for research on politics  \n<time>40:23</time> Online activism  \n<time>48:47</time> The impact of online misinformation  \n<time>59:25</time> Navigating the digital world without becoming cynical  \n<time>1:06:15</time> Follow Dr. Jungherr’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Jungherr’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3zyvYIt  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3aVpqKp  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3tYB7s6  \nTwitter handle: @ajungherr\n",
