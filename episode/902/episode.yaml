shownotes: "Dr. Joshua Knobe is Professor of Philosophy, Linguistics and Psychology\
  \ at Yale University. A lot of his recent research has been concerned with the impact\
  \ of people\u2019s moral judgments on their intuitions about questions that might\
  \ initially appear to be entirely independent of morality (questions about intention,\
  \ causation, etc.).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about topics in experimental philosophy.\
  \ We discuss how experimental philosophy relates to science. We talk about the relationship\
  \ between belief and knowledge. We discuss how norm violations interact with causal\
  \ judgment. We talk about the \u201Ctrue self\u201D, and how moral beliefs influence\
  \ beliefs about the \u201Ctrue self\u201D, and vice-versa. We discuss how people\
  \ conceptualize happiness, and how they relate it to moral character. We talk about\
  \ \u201Cfolk morality\u201D, and whether people tend to believe in objective moral\
  \ truths. We discuss people\u2019s philosophical intuitions, with a focus on free\
  \ will, and how much they vary cross-culturally. We discuss what explains the different\
  \ views of philosophers, and if they stem from individual differences in cognition.\
  \ We talk about how moral judgments influence intuitions in folk psychology, and\
  \ we discuss whether moral judgments influence the production of scientific knowledge.\
  \ Finally, we discuss if the way people interact socially influences how they construe\
  \ truth, and if political polarization changes our understanding of truth.\n\nTime\
