We also tackle the notion of ordoliberalism, and how it connects with Germany, and how the European Union was economically structured. How the 70’s stagflation and the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 changed the course of economics and politics. And also what Dr. Blyth calls the phenomenon of Global Trumpism, and political populism on both the right and the left. We finish up by talking a bit about current economic issues, notably economic inequality in the West and global warming, and how to deal with them.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:40</time> The origins of austerity  \n<time>04:34</time> Ordoliberalism                      \n<time>07:41</time> The economic structure of the European Union               \n<time>12:13</time> The 70’s stagflation and austerity worldwide             \n<time>16:59</time> The global financial crisis of 2007/2008       \n<time>22:13</time> Could it have been handled differently in the EU?  \n<time>26:13</time> Global Trumpism, and populism on the right and the left       \n<time>31:55</time> How to properly deal with the current economic issues    \n<time>36:41</time> Follow Dr. Blyth’s work!    \n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Blyth’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/yc2ops4s  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/y8ruhfpy  \nTwitter handle: @MkBlyth\n",
