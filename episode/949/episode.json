She is a cognitive anthropologist working on moral fairness, perceptions of it, and the topic of gender inequality. She has been looking at fairness perceptions as it occurs in diverse human societies, including hunter-gatherer groups, westernized groups, and different socioeconomic class groups in India.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about moral fairness from an anthropological perspective, and how fairness perceptions differ across societies. We discuss individual preferences, where they come from, and what factors play a role in a preference for individualism versus collectivism. Finally, we discuss gender inequality from an anthropological perspective, and explore topics like gender equality in immediate-return hunter-gatherers, how gender inequality develops, gender inequality in industrialized societies, and imbalances in household division of labor. Finally, we talk about how we can help reduce gender inequality with the knowledge coming from anthropology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> Moral fairness across societies  \n<time>05:22</time> Fairness perceptions  \n<time>18:35</time> Individual preferences, and where they stem from  \n<time>21:04</time> Individualism and collectivism  \n<time>29:42</time> Gender inequality from an anthropological perspective  \n<time>38:05</time> Gender inequality in industrialized societies  \n<time>42:45</time> Is gender inequality a thing of the past?  \n<time>45:16</time> Imbalances in household division of labor  \n<time>59:06</time> Reducing gender inequality  \n<time>1:02:20</time> Follow Angarika’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Angarika’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://tinyurl.com/bdfz98sd  \nResearchGate profile: https://tinyurl.com/4a95udjb\n",
