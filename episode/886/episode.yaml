excerpt: Dr. Randall Beer is Professor of Cognitive Science and Informatics at Indiana
  University Bloomington. Dr. Beer's primary research interest is in understanding
  how coordinated behavior arises from the dynamical interaction of an animal's nervous
  system, its body and its environment. Toward this end, he works on the evolution
  and analysis of dynamical "nervous systems" for model agents, neuromechanical modeling
  of animals, biologically-inspired robotics, and dynamical systems approaches to
  behavior and cognition. More generally, he is interested in computational and theoretical
  biology, including models of metabolism, gene regulation and development.

  \nIn this episode, we talk about biology and cognitive science. We first discuss\
  \ autopoiesis, the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and how it relates\
  \ to cognition. We talk about motor behavior, a brain-body-environment framework,\
  \ studying locomotion in C. elegans, and connectomics. We discuss the relationship\
  \ between biology and cognition, and enactivism. We talk about computational-representationalist\
  \ approaches, and dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We go through the history\
  \ of the situated, embodied, and dynamical framework in cognitive science, and 4E\
  \ cognition. We discuss minimally cognitive agents, and AI systems. Finally, we\
  \ talk about evo-devo approaches in biology, developmental bias, and the extended\
  \ evolutionary synthesis.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n01:05  Autopoiesis  \n\
