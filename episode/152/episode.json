shownotes: "Dr. Erica van de Waal is Professor of Primatology at the University of\
  \ Lausanne, Switzerland. She is also Director of the Inkawu Vervet Project, at the\
  \ Mawana Game Reserve, in South Africa, an experimental field site with a study\
  \ population of over 200 wild vervet monkeys, and a Branco Weiss Fellow of the Society\
  \ in Science at the University of Zurich. She is interested in the evolution of\
  \ primate social behaviors with a main focus on cultural transmission and cognition.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary/biological bases of culture in\
  \ primate species. First, we define culture, and also talk about the cognitive tools\
  \ that primate species need to develop culture, with a few examples of species that\
  \ have it. We also refer to the ways we can compare humans to other primates in\
  \ terms of social cognition and cultural behavior. We also touch on theory of mind,\
  \ and if it\u2019s really necessary to have it to imitate the behavior of others.\
  \ We then discuss if there are primates, apart from humans, that show teaching behavior\
  \ and how they communicate. Finally, we go through the parts of the cognition of\
  \ vervet monkeys that Dr. van de Wall studies, including how their philopatric behavior\
  \ (philopatry refers to the behavior of staying in the group that individuals are\
  \ born in, instead of migrating to other groups. That can be done by males or females,\
  \ and thus we can have male or female philopatry) influences how their culture is\
  \ developed and transmitted.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:51</time> What is culture?\
