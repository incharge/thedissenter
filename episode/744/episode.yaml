shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 16th 2023.  \nDr. Sander van der Linden is Professor\
  \ of Social Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge\
  \ and Director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab. His research interests\
  \ center around the psychology of human judgment, communication, and decision-making,\
  \ including social norms and networks, attitudes and polarization, reasoning about\
  \ evidence, and the public understanding of risk and uncertainty. He is the author\
  \ of Foolproof: Why Misinformation Infects Our Minds and How to Build Immunity.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on Foolproof. We start by distinguishing misinformation\
  \ from disinformation, and then discuss if misinformation is on the rise, and if\
  \ it spreads easier online. We talk about the psychological mechanisms that make\
  \ us susceptible to it, and demographic data. We discuss if the brain is Bayesian,\
  \ and if intelligent and more educated people are more susceptible to misinformation.\
  \ We talk about conspiratorial thinking. We discuss debunking and prebunking, and\
  \ which of them works better. We talk about social media, echo chambers and filter\
  \ bubbles, who spreads misinformation the most, and if it influences political behavior.\
  \ Finally, we talk about how to inoculate people against misinformation.\n\nTime\
