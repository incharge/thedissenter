Her current research focuses on conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual recognition in artificial intelligence systems. Dr. Mitchell is the author or editor of six books and numerous scholarly papers in the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and complex systems.

Her latest book is Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about AI. First, we ask if we are close to human-level AI, and also if the Turing test is really that relevant. Dr. Mitchell explains deep learning and neural networks, evolutionary computation, complex systems, and genetic algorithms. Then we get into conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual recognition. We also discuss if AI systems should have built-in features (innate features). Finally, we talk about the impact that AI already has on our lives.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:03</time> Are we close to human-level AI?  \n<time>05:19</time> Is the Turing test reliable?  \n<time>06:50</time> Deep learning, and neural networks  \n<time>18:02</time> What is evolutionary computation?  \n<time>20:58</time> Embodied cognition  \n<time>26:23</time> Complex systems  \n<time>29:19</time> Genetic algorithms  \n<time>32:11</time> Conceptual abstraction, and analogy-making  \n<time>40:18</time> Visual recognition  \n<time>43:00</time> AI systems with innate features  \n<time>47:39</time> The impact of AI systems on human society  \n<time>51:35</time> Biases that AI systems have  \n<time>1:01:02</time> Follow Dr. Mitchell’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mitchell’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2RlGtvO  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2TRs8ZF  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3kXeEHc  \nComplexity Explorer: https://bit.ly/31UG47K  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/2RlRz44  \nComplexity: A Guided Tour: https://amzn.to/344wXUJ  \nArtificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans: https://amzn.to/31UGqLC  \nTwitter handle: @MelMitchell1\n",
