We talk about the three levels of political radicalization (individual, group, mass), and some of the main mechanisms that go associated with them, with particular focus on social disconnection, grievance (individual and group), and slippery slope processes. We also discuss how people react to threats and what they perceive to be social and political instability. We also cover essentialist thinking and dehumanization, and the hard-to-understand cases of self-sacrifice and lone-wolf terrorism. Toward the end, we also have time to discuss the mismatch between ideology and action, and some solutions to counter (and mostly to prevent) political radicalization.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:10</time> Three levels of political radicalization: individual, group, mass  \n<time>04:47</time> Some of the main mechanisms that operate at the individual level                                                           \n<time>13:16</time> Social disconnection                                               \n<time>14:45</time> Slippery slope processes                                               \n<time>23:25</time> Responses to social and political instability (the economic and the migrant crises)                                                  \n<time>29:40</time> Essentialist thinking, dehumanization and disgust  \n<time>33:00</time> These are all normal mental mechanisms      \n<time>37:06</time> Is it young men that participate in violent acts the most?  \n<time>46:33</time> The complicated cases of lone-wolf terrorism and self-sacrifice    \n<time>58:46</time> Unfortunately, this is difficult research due to low numbers of subjects  \n<time>1:03:47</time> The mismatch between ideology and action  \n<time>1:11:43</time> Some of the best ways to counter and prevent political radicalization                                \n<time>1:20:03</time> Follow Dr. McCauley’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. McCauley’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2PSewte  \nResearchgate profile: https://bit.ly/2VtHrtT  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2PVTklX  \nSTART: https://bit.ly/2Cy0eJD\n\nRelevant books/articles:  \nWhy Not Kill Them All?: The Logic and Prevention of Mass Political Murder: https://amzn.to/2VPVHMJ  \nFriction: How Conflict Radicalizes Them and Us: https://amzn.to/2Va1Q1O  \nThe Marvel of Martyrdom: The Power of Self-Sacrifice in a Selfish World: https://amzn.to/302z6Ml  \nExplaining Homegrown Western Jihadists: The Importance of Western Foreign Policy: https://bit.ly/2VfhXvi\n",
