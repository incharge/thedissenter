  \ of Anthropology at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Puts studies the neuroendocrine\
  \ and evolutionary bases of human sexuality and sex differences, with special focus\
  \ on behavior and psychology. His research topics include the influence of sex hormones\
  \ on psychology, behavior, and anatomy; hormonal and genetic influences on sexual\
  \ differentiation; sexual selection and the evolution of sex differences in voices,\
  \ faces, bodies, brains, and behavior; the development and evolution of variation\
  \ in sexual orientation; and the evolution of female orgasm. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about some of the major topics of Dr. Puts\u2019 research. First, we discuss\
  \ sexual selection and how it is essential to learn more about the evolution of\
  \ human sexual dimorphism. We then talk about sex differences, focusing on the brain\
  \ and cognition. We also refer to some of the main lines of evidence that point\
  \ toward a biological basis for these differences. We also go through the biological\
  \ foundations of sexual orientation, as well as current hypotheses for the evolution\
  \ of female orgasm.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time> Intrasexual competition\
