  \ and research associate at the Smithsonian and used to be a visiting scholar in\
  \ the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, which he used\

  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Human Swarm. We go through topics like: what\
  \ is a society; what makes humans successful; different types of hunter-gatherer\
  \ societies; how societies scale up; markers of membership; how people think about\
  \ societies; identities, and how they change over time; the lifecycle of societies,\
  \ including how they end; war and peace across human history; transfers of membership,\
  \ slavery and subjugation; immigration, and how citizenship is determined; and the\
  \ necessity of societies.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time>\
