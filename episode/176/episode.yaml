shownotes: "Dr. John Brooke is Arts & Sciences Distinguished Professor of History,\
  \ Professor of Anthropology, and Director of the Ohio State University Center for\
  \ Historical Research. He is also the co-chair of the 2011-2012 Program: Disease,\
  \ Health, and Environment in Global History. In 2007-2008 he served as the president\
  \ of the Society of Historians of the Early American Republic. His teaching areas\
  \ include Early American History and Environmental History. His most recent book,\
  \ Climate Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey, published in\
  \ 2014, examines the long material and natural history of the human condition.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about Dr. Brooke\u2019s book, Climate Change and the\
  \ Course of Global History, and about the discipline of Environmental History. We\
  \ start with a definition of the discipline, and its objects of study, and then\
  \ go through some of the major evolutionary steps in our History, like the development\
  \ of culture and agriculture. Then we refer to how climate fluctuations played a\
  \ role in the crash of societies since the advent of agriculture, and also the role\
  \ of epidemics and war. We also talk about a recent study about how the arrival\
  \ of Europeans in the Americas contributed to the death of the death of 55 million\
  \ people and a drop in global temperatures. After that, we discuss the environmental\
  \ conditions that favored the development of the industrial revolution in Northern\
  \ Europe, and how it also might have contributed to the abolishment of slavery.\
  \ Toward the end, we talk about the Anthropocene, and human-made climate change,\
  \ and how to best tackle it, and also the relationship between Environmental History\
  \ and Big History, and using energy/energy density as a common metric from Physics\
  \ to History.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:16</time> What is Environmental History?\
