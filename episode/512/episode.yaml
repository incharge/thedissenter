shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 12th 2021.  \nDr. Sander van der Linden is Professor of\
  \ Social Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge\
  \ and Director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab. His research interests\
  \ center around the psychology of human judgment, communication, and decision-making,\
  \ including social norms and networks, attitudes and polarization, reasoning about\
  \ evidence, and the public understanding of risk and uncertainty.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about social media, fake news, and science communication and denial. We\
  \ first get into several aspects of social media interactions, like how they change\
  \ how people communicate; in what ways they resemble real-life interactions; the\
  \ phenomenon of eco chambers, and political polarization; and fake news and misinformation.\
  \ We talk specifically about the motivations behind the sharing of fake news. We\
  \ then discuss the best ways of doing evidence and science communication, and also\
  \ the idea of inoculating people against misinformation. We go into science denial\
  \ and the politicization of facts, and how to deal with these phenomena. We dive\
  \ into misinformation in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, and what governments\
  \ and health authorities could have done better in communicating about it. Finally,\
  \ we ask if social media represent a net-positive or a net-negative in people\u2019\
  s lives.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Interactions\
