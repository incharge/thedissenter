  \ Review, and co-edited Evolution, Literature, and Film: A Reader.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we discuss Literary Darwinism. We talk about important insights that came from\
  \ sociobiology and evolutionary psychology and how that helped get past approaches\
  \ like poststructuralism and deconstructionism. We also talk about the interplay\
  \ between culture and biology, and some of the most relevant aspects of human psychology\
  \ in literature, as well as how to properly talk about social and cultural constructs\
  \ with biology at their basis. We go through some of the most distinct approaches\
  \ and hypotheses put forth by evolutionary theorists as to the biological bases\
  \ of the arts and literature and how they work, from Pinker\u2019s mental cheesecake,\
  \ to E. O. Wilson\u2019s imaginative virtual worlds, to Geoffrey Miller and sexual\
  \ selection, and to Gad Saad\u2019s consumer behavior and cognitive modules at the\
  \ basis of fiction. We also refer to human universals and Jungian archetypes. Finally,\
  \ we talk about how to approach the study of meaning in literature, and in what\
  \ ways Darwinism and evolutionary theory can contribute to the modernization of\
  \ the Humanities.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:25</time> What is Literary Darwinism?\
