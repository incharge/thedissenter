SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT I HAD SOME SORT OF TECHNICAL ISSUE, AND I COULDN’T RECORD VIDEO. \n\nDr. Phoebe Ellsworth is Frank Murphy Distinguished Professor of Law and Psychology, and Faculty Associate at the ISR Research Center for Group Dynamics, at the University of Michigan, US. She is noted for her work in law and psychology. More specifically, she has done research on jury behavior and decision making, public opinion and the death penalty, and eyewitness identification. Her other main research interest is in emotions. Some areas of research in this topic include facial emotions, cognition and interpretation of emotion.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about emotions, what is innate and cultural about them, several theories about how emotions work. In the second part, we talk about some particular issues in the legal system, like giving too much weight to eyewitnesses; jury decision-making; and what might lead people to support the death penalty.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:59</time> Are emotions universal?   \n<time>12:25</time> Theories about how emotions work                   \n<time>20:13</time> Appraisal theory        \n<time>26:28</time> Evolutionary theory, and emotions as adaptations      \n<time>32:05</time> Can we categorize emotions?          \n<time>37:51</time> How to approach emotional disorders           \n<time>41:39</time> The accuracy of eyewitness testimonies    \n<time>48:56</time> The problem with jury decision-making  \n<time>54:53</time> How to understand support for the death penalty  \n<time>1:00:26</time> Follow Dr. Ellsworth’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Ellsworth’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/y9ftsahf  \nArticles on Researchgate: https://tinyurl.com/y779d3z2\n",
