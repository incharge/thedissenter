excerpt: 'Dr. Scott Grafton is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University
  of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Grafton is interested in how people organize movement
  into goal-oriented action. The emphasis is on elucidating the cognitive architecture
  that underlies action representation. This is developed with studies of sequence
  and skill acquisition, motor simulation, sensorimotor transformation, on-line control
  and action observation experiments. He is the author of Physical Intelligence: The
  Science of How the Body and the Mind Guide Each Other Through Life.'

  \ of Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Grafton is interested\
  \ in how people organize movement into goal-oriented action. The emphasis is on\
  \ elucidating the cognitive architecture that underlies action representation. This\
  \ is developed with studies of sequence and skill acquisition, motor simulation,\
  \ sensorimotor transformation, on-line control and action observation experiments.\
  \ He is the author of Physical Intelligence: The Science of How the Body and the\
  \ Mind Guide Each Other Through Life.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Physical Intelligence.\
  \ We talk about physical intelligence and embodied cognition. We get into topics\
  \ like: how we create a \u201Cmental space\u201D; attention and vigilance; affordances;\
  \ body schema and body self-image; and how people learn new skills. We discuss the\
  \ relationship between the brain and the rest of the body, modularity of mind, and\
  \ artificial intelligence.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time>\
