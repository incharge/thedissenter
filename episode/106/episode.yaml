  \ from an evolutionary perspective. We start off by talking about the social role\
  \ and the evolutionary bases of storytelling. We then look into some of the similarities\
  \ in themes and characters across cultures. We discuss if storytelling might play\
  \ a role in the development of theory of mind in children. We also talk about the\
  \ role of play in children\u2019s development. And we end up talking about some\
  \ of the similarities between oral storytelling and fictional literature, and the\
  \ fact that storytelling still plays a big role in modern societies.\n\nTime Links:\
