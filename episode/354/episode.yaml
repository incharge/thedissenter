  \ computer science at Technical University of Denmark. Dr. Fog does research in\
  \ Evolutionary Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Social systems and Computer\
  \ Science. His current project is 'Theory of cultural change based on evolutionary\

  .\n\nIn this episode, we talk about warlike and peaceful societies. We discuss if\
  \ war is part of human nature, and the ecological conditions that favor war and\
  \ peace. We also mention the social structure of warlike societies. We ask why most\
  \ warriors and chiefs are men. We then get into regality theory, and the differences\
  \ between what Dr. Fog calls regal and kungic societies. We talk about the different\
  \ types of war, focusing mostly on civil wars, and we also about terrorism and counterterrorist\
  \ measures. We also refer to the Long Peace, authoritarianism on the right and the\
  \ left, and scaremongering (in mass media). Finally, we talk about why Scandinavian\
  \ peoples are the happiest in the world, and if regality theory can help us prevent\
  \ and end wars, and change political systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time>\
