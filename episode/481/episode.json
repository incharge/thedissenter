He works primarily on normative and applied ethics, the free will problem, and the meaning of life. He is the author of Free Will and Illusion (Oxford University Press 2000), and 10 Moral Paradoxes (Blackwell 2007).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on moral paradoxes. We first define them, and then we go through some of them, including misfortunes, the paradox of beneficial retirement, punishment, feeling sorry when bad things happen, moral complaint, the obligation to have children and antinatalism, and moral worth. Toward the end, we talk about a normative moral theory that Dr. Smilansky developed, which he calls “Designer Ethics”. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> What are moral paradoxes?  \n<time>08:32</time> Misfortunes  \n<time>15:03</time> Beneficial retirement  \n<time>22:20</time> Punishment  \n<time>29:40</time> Should we always feel sorry when bad things happen?  \n<time>33:53</time> Having children, and antinatalism  \n<time>36:50</time> Moral complaint  \n<time>44:05</time> Moral worth  \n<time>54:52</time> Should we sacrifice the utilitarians? - Designer Ethics  \n<time>1:01:24</time> Follow Dr. Smilansky’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Smilansky’s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/2Mephs0  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/38cEP7Q  \nPhilPeople profile: http://bit.ly/3bhSU5S  \nAmazon page: http://amzn.to/3rlixrV  \n10 Moral Paradoxes: https://amzn.to/3pD4SeJ\n",
