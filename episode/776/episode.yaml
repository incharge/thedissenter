  \ Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Cognitive Science Program at Dartmouth\
  \ College. She is affiliated faculty with Psychological and Brain Sciences. Dr.\
  \ Roskies' philosophical research interests lie at the intersection of philosophy\
  \ and neuroscience, and include philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and ethics.\
  \ She was a member of the McDonnell Project in Neurophilosophy, and the MacArthur\
  \ Law and Neuroscience Project. Awards include the William James Prize and the Stanton\
  \ Prize, awarded by the Society of Philosophy and Psychology, a Mellon New Directions\
  \ Fellowship, and the Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellowship from the\
  \ Princeton University Center for Human Values.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ neuroimaging studies, neuroethics, and free will. Starting with neuroimaging,\
  \ we discuss the information we can get from it; what brain activity means; and\
  \ what neuroscience adds to the study of human behavior. We then get into neuroethics,\
  \ and talk about agency, going through an example of deep brain stimulation applied\
  \ to alleviating Parkinson\u2019s Disease; criteria for medical interventions; neuroscience\
  \ in the courtroom; and moral responsibility. We also discuss issues with how scientists\
  \ approach free will, including Robert Sapolsky\u2019s approach; conditions where\
  \ people lack free will; if free will can exist without consciousness; and the idea\
  \ of \u201Cfree won\u2019t\u201D.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n\
