  \ at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Dr. Halpern's areas of expertise\
  \ include the history of physics, cultural aspects of physics, and theoretical astrophysics\
  \ & cosmology. He is the author of numerous books, the most recent one being The\
  \ Allure of the Multiverse: Extra Dimensions, Other Worlds, and Parallel Universes.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Allure of the Multiverse. We start by talking\
  \ about how old the ideas of the multiverse is, and the ideas of Giordano Bruno,\
  \ Galileo, and Nietzsche. We then get into the multiverse according to theoretical\
  \ physicists; Einstein, Kaluza, string theory, and going beyond 3 dimensions of\
  \ reality. We talk about the Big Bang and the origins of our universe; counterfactuals;\
  \ and why the Universe is habitable. We discuss what a \u201Ctheory of everything\u201D\
  \ would look like, and the difficulties in integrating gravity with quantum physics.\
  \ We also talk about the future of our universe, time travel, and the simulation\
  \ hypothesis. Finally, we discuss how the multiverse is portrayed in science fiction,\
  \ and the meanings people attribute to the multiverse.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
