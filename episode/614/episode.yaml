shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 11th 2022.  \nDr. Andrew Sayer is Emeritus Professor\
  \ of Social Theory and Political Economy at Lancaster University. He is known for\
  \ significant contributions to methodology and theory in the social sciences. He\
  \ is the author of multiple books, including Why We Can't Afford the Rich.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we focus on Why We Can\u2019t Afford the Rich. We start by talking\
  \ about economic inequality, and how it got worse since the rise of neoliberalism.\
  \ We define who are the \u201Crich\u201D, and go through how they took control of\
  \ the economy, how much they really contribute to it, how they spend their money,\
  \ and how they influence politics. We talk about the concept of a \u201Cmoral economy\u201D\
  , and earned income and meritocracy. We ask if capitalism itself is the problem,\
  \ and go through some of the potential solutions for economic inequality.\n\nTime\
