excerpt: "Dr. Renee Magnan is Associate Professor and Director of Experimental Training\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at Washington State University. She applies social\
  \ psychological theory to address issues in preventive health behaviors and health\
  \ behavior promotion. Specifically, much of the research in her lab focuses on understanding\
  \ the role that affect (e.g., worry) plays on health decisions and behavior (e.g.,\
  \ smoking cessation, exercise, cannabis). She is interested in both how one\u2019\
  s feelings about health behaviors may influence their decisions to engage in health\
  \ behavior and also how health behaviors may influence one\u2019s feelings. Both\
  \ perspectives can provide important insight to identify targets for interventions\
  \ to prevent negative health consequences and promote wellness."

  \ and Director of Experimental Training in the Department of Psychology at Washington\
  \ State University. She applies social psychological theory to address issues in\
  \ preventive health behaviors and health behavior promotion. Specifically, much\
  \ of the research in her lab focuses on understanding the role that affect (e.g.,\
  \ worry) plays on health decisions and behavior (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise,\
  \ cannabis). She is interested in both how one\u2019s feelings about health behaviors\
  \ may influence their decisions to engage in health behavior and also how health\
  \ behaviors may influence one\u2019s feelings. Both perspectives can provide important\
  \ insight to identify targets for interventions to prevent negative health consequences\
  \ and promote wellness.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Health Psychology. We dig\
  \ into what is affect and how it influences health behavior. We refer to the negative\
  \ consequences of physical inactivity, and its relationship with mental health.\
  \ We also address addictive behaviors, and adolescence and risky behavior of all\
  \ types. Finally, we talk about the types of health messaging that work the best,\
  \ and also problems with medical advice and treatment compliance, and how we can\
  \ improve them.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:01</time> What is Health Psychology?\
