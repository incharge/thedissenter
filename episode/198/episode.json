We start by talking about traditional approaches to sociology, the limitations of sociocultural accounts of human behavior, the importance of fields like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and the criteria to determine that a behavioral trait has a biological basis. We also discuss how to think about culture, and the relationship between culture and biology, and then Dr. Sanderson gives an overview of his Darwinian conflict theory, that tries to integrate evolutionary theory with Weberian conflict theory (with bits of Marx in there). Finally, we talk about Dr. Sanderson’s work on religion, and three different types of religion – shamanic, polytheistic (pagan), and monotheistic (world transcendent).\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:47</time> Problems with traditional Sociology approaches (Marx, Weber, Durkheim, the postmodernists, and others), and the Standard Social Science Model  \n<time>20:40</time> Early 19th century biological approaches to human society (Westermarck, Galton, Spencer, Huxley)                                                           \n<time>28:02</time> The influence of Boas and Mead                                                \n<time>32:18</time> How to properly think about cultural variation, and the modularity of mind approach                                               \n<time>39:52</time> Criteria to determine that human behavior has a biological basis                                                \n<time>45:13</time> We would also need biology to explain environmental determinism  \n<time>49:12</time> What is culture really about?
