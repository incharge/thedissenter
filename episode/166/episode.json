We refer to the importance of individual variation and things like behavioral flexibility. Also, the Big Five, and a couples of examples of how such traits might have evolved, and their neuroscientific underpinnings. Finally, how environmental effects are biologically mediated, and the ways by which personality changes during the life course of people.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time> What is personality, from an evolutionary perspective?  \n<time>03:29</time> Individual variation          \n<time>06:30</time> Behavioral flexibility                   \n<time>08:26</time> Genetics and the environment               \n<time>11:22</time> What we try to capture with the Big Five                    \n<time>14:05</time> How each personality trait might have evolved            \n<time>16:58</time> Personality and neuroscience       \n<time>19:56</time> Is there any personality trait that is always disadvantageous to have?      \n<time>23:55</time> Traits associated with mating success  \n<time>28:20</time> The issue with cross-cultural evidence  \n<time>31:17</time> The effects of the environment are biologically-mediated  \n<time>36:36</time> The same environment affects different people with different personalities in different ways  \n<time>38:34</time> The stability and variation in personality over the course of life  \n<time>43:59</time> There is no one best way to live life     \n<time>53:06</time> Follow Dr. Nettle’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Nettle’s work:  \nPersonal Website/Blog: https://www.danielnettle.org.uk/  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2U9oUhH  \nArticles of Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2NxrY4p  \nBooks: https://amzn.to/2T0chc0  \nTwitter handle: @danielnettle\n\nBooks/articles referenced in the interview:  \nPersonality: What Makes You the Way You Are: https://amzn.to/2TmiJta  \nHanging on to the Edges: Essays on Science, Society and the Academic Life: https://bit.ly/2T1rUAe  \nStatus and Mating Success Amongst Visual Artists: https://bit.ly/2XpW3rh\n",
