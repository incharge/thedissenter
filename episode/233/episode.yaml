  \ episode, we focus mostly on Dr. Nesse\u2019s most recent book. We first talk about\
  \ the field of Evolutionary Medicine, and refer specifically to phenomena like antagonistic\
  \ pleiotropy and aging, evolutionary mismatch and modern disease, and if we should\
  \ approach diseases as adaptations. We then move on to discussing issues in Psychiatry\
  \ and Clinical Psychology; the classification of mental disorders; studying emotions\
  \ from an evolutionary perspective; and the Smoke Detector Principle. We talk about\
  \ depression, and how we haven\u2019t evolved to feel good or experience wellbeing.\
  \ In the latter part of the interview, we discuss Psychoanalysis and the self-defense\
  \ mechanisms, and also if people can benefit from learning about how their minds\
  \ operate, from an evolutionary standpoint. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:21</time>\
