shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 13th, 2020.\n\nDr. Holger Wiese is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, where he runs an EEG lab.\
  \ He is mainly interested in face recognition and face perception. He investigates\
  \ how we recognize familiar faces, how we learn new facial identities, why people\
  \ are more accurate at remembering faces of their own ethnic and age groups, how\
  \ we perceive age, sex, and attractiveness in unfamiliar faces, and how our knowledge\
  \ about other people is structured in semantic memory. He is also interested in\
  \ how these aspects of face and person perception change across the adult lifespan.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we talk about face recognition. We first refer to its possible\
  \ function(s), and how it is processed in the brain. We discuss what information\
  \ people get from faces, and the phenomena of face familiarity and what makes faces\
  \ distinctive. We also refer to biases in face recognition, and if they can me modified.\
  \ Other topics include: cognitive ageing and difficulties in face recognition; the\
  \ relationship between semantic memory and face memory; male and female faces; and\
  \ facial attractiveness. \n\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:02</time> What could be the\
