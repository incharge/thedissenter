shownotes: "Dr. Heather Berlin is an Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and\
  \ Neuroscience at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. She\
  \ explores the neural basis of impulsive and compulsive psychiatric and neurological\
  \ disorders with the aim of developing novel treatments. She is also interested\
  \ in the brain basis of consciousness, dynamic unconscious processes, and creativity.\
  \ Clinically, she specializes in lifespan treatment of anxiety, mood, and impulsive\
  \ and compulsive disorders.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about impulsivity\
  \ and compulsivity. We discuss the differences between impulsive and compulsive\
  \ disorders, how they overlap, and their neural bases. We talk about disorders like\
  \ kleptomania, pyromania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hypersexual behavior, and\
  \ borderline personality disorder. We then discuss the study of consciousness, and\
  \ talk about the history of conceptualizations about the unconscious, the dynamic\
  \ unconscious, and a recent discussion surrounding the integrated information theory\
  \ of consciousness. We also talk about suppression, repression, psychoanalysis,\
  \ and accessing the unconscious; and the link between consciousness and the unconscious,\
  \ and creativity. Finally, we discuss the challenges of science communication.\n\
