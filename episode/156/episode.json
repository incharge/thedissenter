  Philosophy of Music and Art\u201D: https://youtu.be/HUiV4Hgw924\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about aesthetic and artistic tastes and preferences, and their innate\
  \ and acquired aspects. We also refer to the issues with trying to find patterns\
  \ in music from different times and cultures that might be universal and biologically\
  \ based. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:12</time> Are aesthetic and artistic preferences\
  \ innate or acquired?  \n<time>04:09</time> Biological and physiological constraints\
  \                           \n<time>09:08</time> The relationship between musical\
  \ sounds and natural sounds        \n<time>13:51</time> Is there a \u201Csavannah\
  \ hypothesis\u201D for the evolutionary bases of music?                \n<time>18:38</time>\
  \ Social influences              \n<time>28:54</time> The issues with finding patterns\
