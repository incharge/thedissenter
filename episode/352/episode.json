We talk about play in males and females; differences in education and occupational choices, according to personality tendencies; assessing sex differences and similarities; gender stereotypes, and if they are right; the distinction between “sex” and “gender”, and if it is a useful one; evolutionary and socialization theories of sex differences; things that people from the socialization side get wrong about evolutionary psychology; animal models, and comparative psychology; and, finally, why it is important, not only for scientists but also to the general public, to study and learn about sex differences.  \nThis is the second part of a 2-part talk on gender differences.
