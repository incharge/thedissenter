  \ at Aalto University School of Business, Finland. Dr. H\xE4yry\u2019s main fields\
  \ of interest have been moral and political philosophy and philosophical bioethics.\
  \ His practical topics in bioethics have ranged from abortion, euthanasia, and resource\

  \ Self-Corruption.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Antinatalism, Extinction, and\
  \ the End of Procreative Self-Corruption. We start by talking about the history\
  \ of antinatalism in the Western tradition, from ancient Greece to Christianity,\
  \ and the past 300 years. We discuss other \u201Cisms\u201D associated with antinatalism,\
  \ and we focus on extinctionism. We talk about what constitutes a good life, and\
  \ arguments against reproduction. We discuss the most popular current arguments\
  \ for antinatalism, and Dr. H\xE4yry\u2019s alternative argument. Finally, we explore\
  \ the possible routes to an antinatalist society.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
