shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 1st 2022.  \nDr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor Emeritus\
  \ in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.\
  \ Dr. Hoffman studies consciousness, visual perception and evolutionary psychology\
  \ using mathematical models and psychophysical experiments. He is the author of\
  \ The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on The Case Against Reality, and the interface theory of perception.\
  \ We start by discussing the interface theory of perception, shape as an effective\
  \ code for fitness, different ways of perceiving \u201Creality\u201D, and what is\
  \ \u201Creal\u201D. We address scientific and philosophical objections to the theory,\
  \ and epistemological approaches that might differ from empirical science. We talk\
  \ about simulated realities, and discuss if they are really different from what\
  \ we normally perceive. We talk about the use of psychedelics; and spirits, ghosts,\
  \ and gods as experiences. We ask if \u201Ctruth-seeing\u201D organisms could evolve,\
  \ and if we could ever perceive objective reality. Finally, we talk about breaking\
  \ the tension between science and spiritual and religious traditions.\n\nTime Links:\
