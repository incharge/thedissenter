shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 29th, 2020.  \nMax Beilby is a Management and Organizational\
  \ Psychologist and author of the Darwinian Business blog. He\u2019s currently working\
  \ as a practitioner in the banking industry.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the\
  \ application of Evolutionary Psychology to Organizational Psychology. We start\
  \ by tackling the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and then go through some examples\
  \ of it that apply to the modern workplace, like Dunbar\u2019s number, leadership\
  \ and hierarchy, overconfidence, and dissatisfaction, stress, and burnout. We also\
  \ refer to sex differences and if they have any implications in the workplace. Finally,\
  \ we discuss possible solutions coming from the knowledge we already have and refer\
  \ to cultural evolution.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:28</time> Evolutionary mismatch\
