  \ episode, we talk about Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy. We start by discussing why\
  \ Nietzsche\u2019s body of work is open to so many different interpretations, and\
  \ whether there is intellectual continuity across his works. We talk about the concept\
  \ of Z\xFCchtung, and how it applies to biopolitics. We discuss what Nietzsche means\
  \ by \u201Crace\u201D, how European/white supremacists misinterpret Nietzsche, the\
  \ process of incorporation (Einverleibung), and Nietzsche\u2019s call to overcome\
  \ race (\xDCber-Rasse). We talk about how in Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy the point\
  \ of view of value is more fundamental than the point of view of truth. We discuss\
  \ the genealogical method. Finally, we discuss whether Nietzsche\u2019s notion of\
  \ the \xDCbermensch relates to contemporary transhumanist ideas.\n\nTime Links:\
