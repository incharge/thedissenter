Her research and teaching areas are Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, ethics, and feminist philosophy.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Nietzsche’s philosophy. We start by discussing why Nietzsche’s body of work is open to so many different interpretations, and whether there is intellectual continuity across his works. We talk about the concept of Züchtung, and how it applies to biopolitics. We discuss what Nietzsche means by “race”, how European/white supremacists misinterpret Nietzsche, the process of incorporation (Einverleibung), and Nietzsche’s call to overcome race (Über-Rasse). We talk about how in Nietzsche’s philosophy the point of view of value is more fundamental than the point of view of truth. We discuss the genealogical method. Finally, we discuss whether Nietzsche’s notion of the Übermensch relates to contemporary transhumanist ideas.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:04</time> Why is Nietzsche’s body of work open to so many different interpretations?  \n<time>05:46</time> Is there intellectual continuity across Nietzsche’s works?  \n<time>11:41</time> Züchtung (breeding/cultivation)  \n<time>21:52</time> How Züchtung applies to biopolitics  \n<time>38:50</time> What Nietzsche means by “race”  \n<time>45:33</time> How European/white supremacists misinterpret Nietzsche  \n<time>57:28</time> The process of incorporation (Einverleibung)  \n<time>1:07:03</time> Nietzsche’s call to overcome race (Über-Rasse)  \n<time>1:17:33</time> The point of view of values, and the point of view of truth  \n<time>1:22:06</time> The genealogical method  \n<time>1:42:01</time> Does Nietzsche’s notion of the Übermensch relate to contemporary transhumanist ideas?  \n<time>1:53:34</time> Follow Dr. García-Granero’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. García-Granero’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/43nbP7z  \nPhilPeople profile: https://bit.ly/3MSS0zM  \nTwitter handle: @MarinaGGranero\n",
