shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2023.  \nDr. David Pinsof is a research scientist\
  \ who received his PhD in Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles\
  \ in 2018. David\u2019s research focuses on evolutionary psychology, political psychology,\
  \ public opinion, and sexual behavior. His empirical work explores individual differences\
  \ in mating psychology and their relation to political attitudes, mathematical models\
  \ of alliance formation, and the origins of political belief systems.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we start by talking about the alliance theory of political belief systems.\
  \ We discuss common explanations of political belief systems, and their inconsistency;\
  \ social dynamics, and how people form and maintain alliances; the Democratic/Republican\
  \ divide in the US; and moral foundations theory, and moral systems. We discuss\
  \ whether the meaning of life matters, and the motivations behind intellectual debates,\
  \ including status-seeking. We talk about the link between morality and violence.\
  \ Finally, we discuss social paradoxes, virtue-signaling, and self-deception.\n\n\
