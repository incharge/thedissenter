shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 11th, 2019.  \nDr. Peter S. Ungar is Distinguished\
  \ Professor of Anthropology and Director of Environmental Dynamics at the University\
  \ of Arkansas. His research focuses on paleoecology and teeth. He\u2019s the author\
  \ of books like Mammal Teeth, Evolution\u2019s Bite, and of textbooks like Human\
  \ Diet: Its Origin and Evolution.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the evolution\
  \ of teeth. We discuss how anthropologists study teeth and how they are used. We\
  \ address the important distinction between what an animal can eat and the types\
  \ of foods it has available. We talk a little bit about the evolutionary origins\
  \ of teeth. Dr. Ungar refers to the study of tartar, that began very recently. We\
  \ also talk about how we can reconstruct diets and environments from teeth. We then\
  \ refer to the evolutionary mismatch posed by our modern human diets, and the kinds\
  \ of oral health problems that derive from that. In the end, we also talk about\
  \ the problems with arguments coming from veganism and the paleo diet about our\
  \ diets.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:43</time> How anthropologists study teeth  \n\
