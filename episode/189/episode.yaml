shownotes: "Dr. Viviana Weekes-Shackelford received her Ph.D. in evolutionary developmental\
  \ psychology in 2011 from Florida Atlantic University. She is currently Visiting\
  \ Assistant Professor in Sociology and Criminal Justice at Oakland University and\
  \ Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology Lab. Her research over the years has\
  \ been evolutionarily inspired and has had the broader goal of gaining a more comprehensive\
  \ understanding of violence and conflict in families and romantic relationships.\
  \ Her research interests and record cut across the psychological domains of forensics,\
  \ development, social, personality, clinical, and criminology.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we expand on the first interview I\u2019ve had with Dr. Todd Shackelford (https://youtu.be/-sFFlebGP70),\
  \ and talk about things related to human romantic relationships and parent-offspring\
  \ conflict. First, we discuss the importance of parental investment theory in understanding\
  \ where conflict in romantic relationships stems from, and the role that fathers\
  \ play in raising children. We also try to conceive how this knowledge could translate\
  \ into social policy, when it comes to child support and other kinds of social issues.\
  \ Then, we talk about domestic violence as a set of evolved mate guarding tactics,\
  \ and violence exerted on children on the part of genetic parents and stepparents.\
  \ And, finally, before talking about the specific case of filicide-suicide, we go\
  \ off on a tangent to talk about evolutionary mismatch and some ways by which modern\
  \ environments might affect us, including technology like social media. \n\nTime\
