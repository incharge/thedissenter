Her research interests include aging and the life course, psychosocial factors influences on health over the life course, and end-of-life issues. Her latest book is Aging in America.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on aging, but also tackle other social issues in the US. We first discuss the obesity “epidemic”, the causes of obesity, and weight stigma. We talk about the relationship between the kinds of physical activity people engage in and perceived health. We discuss the life trajectories and long-term planning of married and single people. We talk about challenges in time management for married couples with children, changes in gender roles, and work-life balance. We discuss challenges disabled people face (during the pandemic, at work, and in old age), and how hard it is being poor/leaving poverty. We talk about racial and ethnic differences in healthcare planning, how perceptions of survival affect it, and end-of-life decisions. Finally, we discuss how widowhood affects people, and the social effects of inequality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> The obesity “epidemic”, the causes of obesity, and weight stigma  \n<time>10:04</time> The relationship between the kinds of physical activity people engage in and perceived health  \n<time>12:01</time> How sociology can play a role in medicine and healthcare  \n<time>13:52</time> The life trajectories and long-term planning of married and single people  \n<time>19:13</time> Do states discriminate against single people?  \n<time>25:22</time> Challenges in time management for married couples with children  \n<time>27:35</time> Changes in gender roles  \n<time>30:04</time> Work-life balance  \n<time>33:45</time> Challenges disabled people face (during the pandemic, at work, and in old age)  \n<time>42:22</time> How hard it is to leave poverty  \n<time>47:40</time> Racial and ethnic differences in healthcare planning  \n<time>51:32</time> How perceptions of survival affect healthcare planning  \n<time>53:04</time> End-of-life decisions  \n<time>58:11</time> How widowhood affects people  \n<time>1:02:21</time> Does inequality affect people in their old age?  \n<time>1:11:13</time> Follow Dr. Carr’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Carr’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3GuL86S  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3VX0jeM  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3iqGD5w  \nAging in America: https://bit.ly/3XGCYiP\n",
