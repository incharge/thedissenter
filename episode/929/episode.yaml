shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 28th 2024.  \nDr. Emily Qureshi-Hurst is Stipendiary\
  \ Lecturer in Philosophy at Oriel College and a Junior Research Fellowship at Pembroke\
  \ College, University of Oxford. She completed a D.Phil at the University of Oxford\
  \ in Science and Religion (2021). Her thesis examined the theoretical support for\
  \ a B-theory of time provided by special and general relativity, and re-interpreted\
  \ Paul Tillich's doctrine of salvation in light of this metaphysical temporal model.\
  \ She is the author of God, Salvation, and the Problem of Spacetime.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on God, Salvation, and the Problem of Spacetime. We start by\
  \ talking about the metaphysics of time, and we go through how ancient and medieval\
  \ philosophers understood time, the link between time and theology, and how people\
  \ think about time nowadays. We discuss how physics relates to metaphysics, and\
  \ how spacetime relates to theology. We explore questions related to the nature\
  \ of God, human salvation, and resurrection. Finally, we discuss whether science\
  \ and theology can be reconciled.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n\
