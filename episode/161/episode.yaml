  \ aspects of wearing clothes. He\u2019s also the author of the recent book Climate,\
  \ Clothing, and Agriculture in Prehistory: Linking Evidence, Causes, and Effects\
  \ (2018).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of clothing and the adoption\
  \ of agriculture in human societies. First, we talk about hypotheses as to how our\
  \ naked skin might have evolved, and when in our evolutionary history we started\
  \ wearing clothes and the environmental factors that favored its development. We\
  \ also briefly refer to the limitations in terms of the information we can derive\
  \ from studies on modern hunter-gatherers, if we\u2019re trying to learn more about\
  \ how our species evolved and how people behaved back in the Pleistocene. We go\
  \ through the differences between simples and complex clothing (the latter includes\
  \ textile clothing), and also between clothing based on animal skin and fur and\
  \ clothing based on textiles. Then, we discuss the ways by which clothing might\
  \ have played a causal role in the adoption of agriculture and making it the center\
  \ of our economy, the problems that early agricultural societies went through, and\
  \ also why we domesticated animals. We finish off by talking about the psychological\
  \ and social aspects of clothing, including decoration.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:56</time>\
