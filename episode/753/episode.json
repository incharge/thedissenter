Paul Thompson holds appointments as Professor in the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. He has published extensively on evolutionary theory, population genetics, mathematical modelling in biology, theory structure in biology, philosophy of medicine, and ethics. He is the author of Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society. We first talk about a social contract theory of morality, evolutionary reproductive success, kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and the role of rational deliberation. We go through three derived principles of inclusion, individual sovereignty (liberty), and equality, and social issues like patriarchy, individual sovereignty and copulatory choices, and overpopulation and extinction. Finally, we ask if an evolutionary account of human morality commits us to moral anti-realism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time> A social contract theory of morality  \n<time>04:30</time> Evolutionary reproductive success  \n<time>05:39</time> Kin selection and reciprocal altruism  \n<time>09:59</time> The role of rational deliberation  \n<time>13:15</time> Three derived principles: inclusion, individual sovereignty (liberty), and equality  \n<time>20:27</time> Sexual inequality and patriarchy  \n<time>26:22</time> Does patriarchy damage evolutionary reproductive success?  \n<time>29:14</time> How cognition mediates moral behavior  \n<time>33:08</time> The copulatory choices of individuals  \n<time>40:15</time> Does the number of offspring individuals have matter?  \n<time>43:35</time> When are social intervention and social coercion justified?  \n<time>48:23</time> Overpopulation and extinction  \n<time>54:31</time> Does an evolutionary account of human morality commit us to moral anti-realism?  \n<time>1:00:52</time> Follow Dr. Thompson’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Thompson’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3aATT3y  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3O5tnx0  \nEvolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society: https://amzn.to/3aBeAfC\n",
