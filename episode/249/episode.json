We discuss the levels of analysis through which we can study social phenomena, and why intuitive explanations don’t work. We also refer to perverse incentives in the social sciences. Dr. Hoffman then talks about the example of cognitive dissonance, and the correct interpretation of the phenomenon. In the latter part of the interview, we discuss the aspects of (social) behavior that evolutionary psychology explains well, and where it fails or is not enough.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:55</time> Issues with how people study social phenomena (particularly in social psychology)  \n<time>04:40</time> Levels of analysis for studying behavioral/social phenomena  \n<time>11:28</time> The problem with explanations in social psychology  \n<time>16:22</time> Why intuitive explanations don’t work  \n<time>21:42</time> Perverse incentives in the social sciences  \n<time>27:42</time> The example of cognitive dissonance  \n<time>38:28</time> Why we can’t change people’s thinking and behavior with facts  \n<time>44:09</time> The interplay between evolutionary psychology and game theory  \n<time>1:01:28</time> Cultural traditions (and the example of the use of spices in food)  \n<time>1:03:25</time> Applying evolutionary psychology to understand social incentives  \n<time>1:12:53</time> Critique to Steven Pinker’s take on “moral progress”  \n<time>48:53</time> Follow Dr. Hoffman’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Hoffman’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/y7g2ubal  \nPersonal website: https://tinyurl.com/yboyxvxu  \nArticles on Researchgate: https://tinyurl.com/ybxwknfs  \nTwitter handle: @Moshe_Hoffman\n\nThe Twitter threads:  \n“The problems w/ “theories” in psychology.”: http://bit.ly/30hRgt6  \n“Best criticism of social-psychology I have seen”: http://bit.ly/30jBY6W  \n“Some thoughts on how to spot bull-shit in science/academia”: http://bit.ly/2KNRdys  \n“A good theory should”: http://bit.ly/2NiMMyA  \n“Why do I think our preferences and ideologies respond to incentives?”: http://bit.ly/31O3h9R  \n“A thread clarifying my criticism of Evolutionary Psychology”: http://bit.ly/31H8xfA  \n“Why do people have ridiculous beliefs?”: http://bit.ly/30mhb2M\n",
