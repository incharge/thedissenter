shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2024.  \nDr. Andrew Delton is Associate Professor\
  \ in the Department of Political Science, the Center for Behavioral Political Economy,\
  \ and the College of Business at Stony Brook University.   \nDr. Talbot Andrews\
  \ is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Connecticut.\
  \ Her research focuses on how institutions, public policy, and the physical environment\
  \ shape preferences and behavior related to climate change.  \nThey are both authors\
  \ of Climate Games: Experiments on How People Prevent Disaster.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Climate Games. We first talk about the challenges of climate change,\
  \ and the best solutions we have for it. We discuss why climate change is a \u201C\
  global social dilemma\u201D, and how we can use economic games, like the disaster\
  \ game, to study how people make decisions that are relevant to climate change.\
  \ We talk about how people react to different kinds of technology, to what extent\
  \ they are willing to help other groups of people and avoid disaster for others,\
  \ and the relationship between leaders and citizens. We also talk about how we can\
  \ study inequality through disaster games. Finally, we discuss whether we can be\
  \ optimistic about tackling climate change.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
