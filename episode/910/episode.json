shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 26th 2023.  \nDr. Daniel Simons is a Professor in\
  \ the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois, where he directs the\
  \ Visual Cognition Laboratory. Dr. Simons studies visual cognition, perception,\
  \ attention, and memory. Most of his recent research has focused on the cognitive\
  \ underpinnings of our experience of a stable and continuous visual world. He is\
  \ the author of The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us,\
  \ and more recently, Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do about\
  \ It.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Nobody\u2019s Fool. We talk about our \u201C\
  truth bias\u201D, why it works most of the time, and what makes people skeptical\
  \ in certain situations. We go through four psychological habits that make us susceptible\
  \ to deception: focus, prediction, commitment, and efficiency. We discuss expectation-based\
  \ reasoning, and how it can affect the production of scientific knowledge. We also\
  \ go through four hooks that deceivers use: consistency, familiarity, precision,\
  \ and potency. Finally, we talk about how deceivers try to target the most vulnerable\
  \ people.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:33</time> The premise\
