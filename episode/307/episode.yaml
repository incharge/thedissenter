shownotes: "RECORDED ON DECEMBER 30th, 2019.  \nTHIS IS AN AUDIO-ONLY INTERVIEW. \
  \ \nDr. Elizabeth Loftus is a Distinguished Professor of Psychological Science and\
  \ Law, and of Cognitive Science in the Departments of Psychological Science, and\
  \ Criminology, Law, and Society at University of California, Irvine. She is also\
  \ Fellow of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Dr. Loftus is\
  \ best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness\
  \ memory, and the creation and nature of false memories, including recovered memories\
  \ of childhood sexual abuse. As well as her work inside the laboratory, she has\
  \ been involved in applying her research to legal settings.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we first talk about how memories can be interfered with, and refer to the misinformation\
  \ effect. We also discuss if people rewrite their memories when they recall them.\
  \ Then we get into the many issues with eyewitness testimonies, and how to improve\
  \ on them. Finally, we also go through the repressed and recovered memory therapy,\
  \ its several flaws, and how it affects patients and other potential victims. \n\
