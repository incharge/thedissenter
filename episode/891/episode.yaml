  \ of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences (tenured) at the University of Central Florida.\
  \ He is concurrently a Fellow in the Research Corporation for Science Advancement's\
  \ Molecular Basis of Cognition Scialog program. His research attempts to understand\
  \ mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary\
  \ perspective.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about complexity science,\
  \ and how it applies to the study of the mind, and the relationship between mind\
  \ and brain. We then go through embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and extended\
  \ cognition. We talk about computational-representational approaches in cognitive\
  \ science and their limitations, and the computer metaphor of the mind. We discuss\
  \ dynamical systems theory, what a dynamical system is, and a recent dynamical renaissance\
  \ in neuroscience. Finally, we talk about mechanistic explanations in science, and\
  \ explanatory pluralism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:55</time>\
