His research focuses on altruism: understanding how it works and how to promote it.\n\nThey are both authors of Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Hidden Games. Topics include: aspects of human behavior that game theory explains; motives and incentives, and why we are oblivious to them; how learning shapes beliefs and tastes; rationality; spillovers; primary and secondary rewards; proximate vs ultimate analyses; the emic-etic distinction; Nash equilibrium; human cooperation; norms and punishment; why we process information according to game-theoretic principles; moral philosophy from a game-theoretic perspective; nudges; and beliefs, and where they come from.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:53</time> What aspects of human behavior is game theory best suited to explain?  \n<time>03:08</time> Why are we so oblivious to the motives and incentives behind our behavior?  \n<time>05:40</time> How learning shapes beliefs and tastes  \n<time>14:27</time> Rationality, and functionality  \n<time>17:20</time> Spillovers  \n<time>20:34</time> Primary and secondary rewards  \n<time>26:53</time> Proximate vs. ultimate analyses  \n<time>29:02</time> The emic-etic distinction  \n<time>31:42</time> Does what people say matter?  \n<time>41:01</time> Nash equilibrium  \n<time>45:18</time> What sustains human cooperation  \n<time>48:09</time> Norm enforcement, and punishment  \n<time>1:00:09</time> Why does our brain process information according to game theory mechanisms? Are these evolved?  \n<time>1:06:10</time> Is moral philosophy simply emic?  \n<time>1:14:52</time> Can we use game theory to nudge people into making better choices and being more “moral”?  \n<time>1:20:02</time> What are beliefs, and where do they come from?  \n<time>1:45:21</time> Follow Drs.
