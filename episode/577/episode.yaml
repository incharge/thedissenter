shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 6th 2021.  \nDr. Russell Gray is the director to the\
  \ Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. He also holds an\
  \ adjunct position in the School of Psychology at the University of Auckland. Dr.\
  \ Gray\u2019s research spans the areas of cultural evolution, linguistics, animal\
  \ cognition, and the philosophy of biology. He helped pioneer the application of\
  \ computational evolutionary methods to questions about linguistic prehistory and\
  \ cultural evolution. His work has shed new insights on the 200 year-old debate\
  \ on the origin of Indo-European languages.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about linguistics,\
  \ cultural evolution, and animal cognition. We start with linguistics, and discuss\
  \ if language is innate or acquired and Universal Grammar; approaches to the study\
  \ of the evolution of languages, like Bayesian phylolinguistics; constraints in\
  \ linguistic variation; the evolution of languages in the Pacific and the timing\
  \ of peopling there; and what we know about the Indo-European language(s). We then\
  \ talk about religion: how notions of god vary with ecology; the relationship between\
  \ Big Gods and social complexity; and ritual human sacrifice and the evolution of\
  \ stratified societies. We discuss D-PLACE, and the difficulties in building comparative\
  \ cultural databases. Finally, we discuss animal cognition, with a focus on the\
  \ cognition of New Caledonian crows and their tool use. We talk about tool use in\
  \ animals, the relationship between brain size and cognitive ability, and the problems\
  \ with talking about a generally \u201Csmart\u201D species and \u201Cone cognition\u201D\
