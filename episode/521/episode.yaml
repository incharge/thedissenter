shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 5th 2021.  \nDr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis\
  \ Professor of Byzantine Greek History at UC San Diego, where he was formerly Co-Director\
  \ of the Center for Hellenic Studies. His research interests center on the intellectual\
  \ and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is\
  \ the author of several books on ancient history, including Mortal Republic: How\
  \ Rome Fell Into Tyranny. His new book is The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome:\
  \ The History of a Dangerous Idea.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Eternal Decline\
  \ and Fall of Rome. We walk through topics like: when did people start theorizing\
  \ about the decline and fall of Rome; the actual factors that played a role in the\
  \ fall of Rome; periods in Roman history where there was renewal without decline,\
  \ and decline and false renewal; dynamics of conservatism, decline, renewal, and\
  \ progress in the history of Rome; the role of Christianity in the later stages\
  \ of the Western Roman Empire, and in the Byzantine Empire; Europe in the aftermath\
  \ of the fall of Rome; the Holy Roman Empire; the \u201Cdecline of the West\u201D\
  , if it is real, and how populists on the right and the left take advantage of narratives\
  \ of \u201Cdecline\u201D. Finally, we discuss how we can prevent populist political\
  \ movements from rising, and the ethical duty of historians.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
