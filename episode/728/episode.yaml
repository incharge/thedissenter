shownotes: "Dr. Filipe Nobre Faria currently works as a researcher in ethics and political\
  \ philosophy at the Institute for Philosophy of the Nova University of Lisbon (IFILNOVA).\
  \ Furthermore, he lectures on subjects of his expertise at the Faculty of Social\

  \ Problems, Market Solutions and the Ethics of Preference Satisfaction.\n\nIn this\
  \ episode, we focus on The Evolutionary Limits of Liberalism. We start with the\
  \ premise of the book, and discuss what liberalism is; the opposing force of communitarianism;\
  \ and individual preferences. We talk about free markets and liberal democracies\
  \ in their capacity to satisfy preferences. We discuss the multilevel selection\
  \ framework adopted in the book, and morality from an evolutionary perspective.\
  \ We talk about moral types, and if it makes sense to distinguish between liberals\
  \ and conservatives. We then discuss what really limits liberalism evolutionarily,\
  \ individualism versus collectivism, and if liberal values will go extinct. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the is/ought distinction.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
