  \ the four relational models at the basis of human sociality \u2013 Communal Sharing,\
  \ Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing -, their universality,\
  \ and also how they vary cross-culturally. We also talk about the relationship between\
  \ sociality and morality, and the moral bases of violence. By the end, we also discuss\
  \ moral relativism, and how science can inform morality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:51</time>\
