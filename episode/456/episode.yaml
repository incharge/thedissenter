  \ focus on CRISPR People. Topics include: the CRISPR technology, and its applications;\
  \ the He Jiankui experiment; gene editing in somatic versus germline cells; the\
  \ ethics of gene editing; the legal aspects of gene editing and similar technologies;\
  \ and how careful scientists should be when communicating about these technologies.\n\
