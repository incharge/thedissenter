	"shownotes": "Dr. Tania Reynolds is Assistant Professor in Psychology at the University of New Mexico.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about male suffering, female same-sex relationships, discrimination in hiring, and moral reactions to covid-19 health responses. We start by talking about the ways men suffer and how they get derogated, and the evolutionary bases to all of that. We go into biases in moral typecasting, and discuss if people are insensitive to male suffering. We then get into what women evolved to look for in same-sex relationship, as well as the challenges they pose. We speculate a bit on the relationships women establish with their mothers-in-law, in the light of parent-offspring conflict. We talk about how women disguise intrasexual competition as prosociality or vulnerability. We also discuss how this applies to the modern workplace, and possible interventions to help women navigate these relationships. We then talk about racial discrimination in the hiring process, and the role played by ideology and “ressentiment”. We also discuss if the same applies to other kinds of discrimination. Finally, we ask if there moral reactions might stem from pathogen disgust.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> In what ways do men suffer?  \n<time>07:06</time> Bias in moral typecasting  \n<time>10:21</time> Derogating men  \n<time>15:36</time> Are people insensitive to male suffering?  \n<time>18:42</time> The evolutionary challenges of female same-sex relationships  \n<time>29:32</time> What about the mother-in-law?  \n<time>33:04</time> Intrasexual competition disguised as prosociality or vulnerability  \n<time>41:54</time> Same-sex relationships in the workplace  \n<time>46:58</time> Interventions to improve same-sex relationships  \n<time>54:14</time> Racial discrimination in the hiring process  \n<time>58:04</time> Ideology and “ressentiment”  \n<time>1:06:07</time> Other kinds of discrimination  \n<time>1:07:54</time> The moralization of covid-19 health response  \n<time>1:18:18</time> Is this about disgust sensitivity?  \n<time>1:22:00</time> Is there moral disgust?  \n<time>1:24:56</time> Follow Dr. Reynolds’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Reynolds’ work:  \nOur first interview: https://youtu.be/n6EWA_Wg3xI  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2XRWnUB  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2LHXWgj  \nTwitter handle: @TaniaArline  \nOur Grandmothers’ Legacy (paper): https://bit.ly/3i9D1Bn\n",
