We also talk about smartphone addiction. We discuss the role that culture plays in mental health. We talk about placebos from an anthropological and clinical perspective, including super placebos and neuroplacebos. Finally, we discuss a Free Energy approach to human cognition and culture, how humans learn shared expectations and norms, and how social conformity develops.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:58</time> The psychological effects of the internet, and its impact on sociality  \n<time>21:03</time> Smartphone addiction  \n<time>26:27</time> What role does culture play in mental health?  \n<time>34:07</time> Placebos, from an anthropological and clinical perspective  \n<time>48:43</time> A Free Energy approach to human cognition and culture  \n<time>57:38</time> How do humans learn shared expectations and norms?  \n<time>1:04:17</time> How does social conformity develop?  \n<time>1:09:45</time> Follow Dr. Veissière’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Veissière’s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3YUQLo2  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3KWSzqM  \nTwitter handle: @samuelveissiere\n",
