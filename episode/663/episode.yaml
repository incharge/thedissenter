  \ philosophical and empirical approaches to study episodic memory, imagination,\
  \ and human communication.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about episode memory and\
  \ imagination. We first talk about episodic memory, what it is, what the ability\
  \ to remember the past entails, why we have it, and thinking about the future. We\
  \ discuss the relationship between memory and human communication, and the social\
  \ functions of memory. Finally, we talk about imagination, and why we have this\
  \ ability.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> What\
