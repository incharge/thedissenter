  \nIn this episode, we focus on Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies. We start\
  \ by discussing the ethics of technology, what socially disruptive technologies\
  \ are, and the intercultural outlook of the book. We then go through social media,\
  \ social robots, climate engineering, and ectogestative technology. We also discuss\
  \ who should be held responsible for social disruption, and whether technology is\
  \ neutral.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:48</time> How\
