shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 20th 2020.  \nDr. Ann-Sophie Barwich is Assistant\
  \ Professor of History and Philosophy of Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana\
  \ University Bloomington. She is a cognitive scientist and empirical philosopher\
  \ & historian of science, technology, and the senses. She divides her brain-time\
  \ between the Department of History & Philosophy of Science and the Cognitive Science\
  \ Program. Estimated begin of lab (EEG/Olfactometry) in early 2021. She\u2019s the\
  \ author of Smellosophy: What the Nose tells the Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Dr. Barwich\u2019s book, Smellosophy. We talk about the complexity behind the\
  \ sense of smell, including the molecular complexity of the olfactory stimulus,\
  \ receptor genes, its neuroscience, comparing smell with other senses, smell and\
  \ memory, and smell and decision-making. In the second part of the talk, we deal\
  \ with general questions in neuroscience and philosophy of mind (and philosophy\
  \ of neuroscience), like functional localization, modularity of mind, qualia, mapping,\
  \ and if we experience the real world. We also discuss interdisciplinarity in academia,\
  \ and the relationship between science and philosophy nowadays.\n\nTime Links: \
