  .\n\nIn this episode, we focus on \u201CLa zarig\xFCeya de Schr\xF6dinger\u201D\
  . We start by talking about the field of comparative thanatology. We discuss how\
  \ we can know that non-human animals have minds, and what a concept is. We talk\
  \ about stereotypical and cognitive reactions to death. We discuss the issue of\
  \ anthropomorphism and anthropectomy. We discuss the criteria for a minimum concept\
  \ of death. We talk about emotional reactions to death, including mourning behaviors.\
  \ We discuss how sociality might point to an understanding of death, as well as\
  \ the importance of experience. We talk about behaviors like violence and predation,\
  \ infanticide, and thanatosis. Finally, we talk about the ethical implications of\
  \ animals having a concept of death.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
