shownotes: "RECORDED ON APRIL 8th 2021.  \nDr. Robin Huw Crompton is professor of\
  \ musculoskeletal biology at the University of Liverpool in the Institute of Ageing\
  \ and Chronic Disease. He has developed the Fossil Footprint Archive jointly with\
  \ Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the\
  \ evolution of human bipedality. We start by talking about the locomotion of our\
  \ common ancestor with chimpanzees, and go through some of the main steps in the\
  \ evolution of our musculoskeletal system. During the conversation, Dr. Crompton\
  \ shows some fossils to the camera. We discuss if we can learn something about the\
  \ evolution of our locomotion by studying the environments we evolved in, and also\
  \ our diet. We talk about some of the hypotheses relating to the evolutionary pressures\
  \ behind our bipedalism. Finally, we talk about modern musculoskeletal diseases.\n\
