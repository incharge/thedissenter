  \ and morality. We start with religious freedom, and the modern secular state. We\
  \ define atheism, and get into the conflict between religion and science. We then\
  \ talk about moral authority, the objectivity of morality, moral skepticism, and\
  \ the relationship between moral nihilism and atheism.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
