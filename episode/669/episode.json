He is deeply interested in moral philosophy and its history, and is focused on questions around the nature of moral obligation and well-being.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about some concepts in moral philosophy. We talk about Dr. Darwall’s take on “morality as accountability”, and how morality is objective. We discuss concepts such as moral obligation (and duty), moral respect, moral rights, and dignity. We talk about the interplay between morality and the law. We discuss the second-person standpoint, second-person morality, and how we move from it to a universal morality. Finally, we talk about the relationship between moral philosophy and moral psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Morality as accountability  \n<time>09:48</time> Dealing with moral absolutism  \n<time>12:17</time> Moral obligation  \n<time>19:49</time> Moral respect  \n<time>26:20</time> Morality and the law  \n<time>34:44</time> Moral rights  \n<time>38:51</time> The dignity of the person  \n<time>41:01</time> The second-person standpoint  \n<time>49:00</time> Moving from a second-person morality to a universal morality  \n<time>51:23</time> The relationship between moral philosophy and moral psychology  \n<time>56:48</time> Follow Dr. Darwall’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Darwall’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3HsciKe  \nPhilPeople page: https://bit.ly/3JVvkKG  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3cnpAye\n",
