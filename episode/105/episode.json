	"shownotes": "UPDATE: Françoise Baylis “Deliberate Design: The Ethics of Human Genome Editing” (forthcoming, Harvard University Press, 2019).\n\nDr. Françoise Baylis is University Research Professor at Dalhousie University, Canada. She is a frequent guest on CBC and Radio Canada. The focus of her research is on issues of women's health and assisted reproductive technologies, but her research and publication record also extend to such topics as research involving humans (including human embryo research), gene editing, novel genetic technologies, public health, the role of bioethics consultants, and neuroethics. She has a forthcoming book on ethics and heritable genome editing with Harvard University Press.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the ethics behind CRISPR-cas9 genome editing technology. The difference between using it in somatic cells versus germline cells; he fuzzy line that separates enhancement from therapy; the example of improving IQ; how this technology can increase the gap between rich and poor, taking it to the whole new level of biological differences; individual and social considerations; and animal ethics. We finish off by talking a little bit about Dr. Baylis’ upcoming book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:02</time> What is CRISPR-cas9?  \n<time>03:22</time> It can be used in any type of living cell                    \n<time>04:25</time> Applying it in somatic vs germline cells         \n<time>06:24</time> Its possible applications in humans          \n<time>08:57</time> Is CRISPR evolving quickly?            \n<time>13:07</time> Enhancement and therapy    \n<time>16:43</time> The complicated example of improving IQ  \n<time>22:52</time> Can we cause problems by reducing genetic diversity?  \n<time>26:07</time> Eugenics  \n<time>29:51</time> Looking at genetic engineering from a societal perspective  \n<time>33:09</time> The many ethical aspects to be evaluated  \n<time>37:28</time> Animal ethics  \n<time>40:25</time> Dr. Baylis’ forthcoming book  (Please read the above UPDATE)  \n<time>44:14</time> Follow her work online\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Baylis’ work:  \nFaculty page: https://tinyurl.com/ya7oxlgd  \nBooks: https://tinyurl.com/y8x39y24  \nTwitter handle: @FrancoiseBaylis\n",
