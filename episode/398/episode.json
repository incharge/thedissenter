We start with what intelligence is, and what would human-level AI look like. We get into what is worrisome about advanced AI systems, and the issue with value alignment. We discuss different instances where AI is already impacting our lives, and where it will progress in the future, including the impact it will have on the job market. We also talk about possible solutions, and if we should be worried about how we treat AI systems.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:49</time> What is intelligence?  \n<time>02:28</time> Human-level AI  \n<time>05:00</time> Should we be worrying about AI?  \n<time>11:50</time> Should the goals of AI be aligned with ours?  \n<time>17:17</time> Can we program moral values into AI systems?  \n<time>22:11</time> Can we simply switch AI off?  \n<time>24:44</time> AI and the job market  \n<time>29:20</time> Are researchers worried enough about the possible negative consequences of AI?  \n<time>32:17</time> Human enhancement, and merging with AI  \n<time>33:32</time> Governance of AI  \n<time>35:19</time> How should we treat AI systems?  \n<time>39:35</time> Solutions  \n<time>46:11</time> Can we be optimistic about the future?  \n<time>48:04</time> Follow Russell’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Russell’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3kQA0V6  \nWebsite:  https://bit.ly/392lfMY  \nResearch works on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3pXhz58  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3lOfiGY\n",
