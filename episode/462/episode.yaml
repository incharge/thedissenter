shownotes: "RECORDED ON MARCH 26th 2021.  \nDr. David Papineau is Professor of Philosophy\
  \ at King's College London, having previously taught for several years at Cambridge\
  \ University where he was a fellow of Robinson College. He was President of the\
  \ British Society for Philosophy of Science for 1993-5, President of the Mind Association\
  \ for 2009-10, and President of the Aristotelian Society for 2013-14. He\u2019s\
  \ also the author of 9 books, including Philosophical Naturalism, Thinking About\
  \ Consciousness, and Knowing the Score. His new book is The Metaphysics of Sensory\
  \ Experience.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Metaphysics of Sensory Experience.\
  \ We first define sensory experience, discuss its conscious nature, and talk about\
  \ false sensory experiences, like illusions and hallucinations. We ask if sensory\
  \ experience is primarily about objects of subjects, and we also define what an\
  \ object of perception is. We discuss the relationship between metaphysics and epistemology.\
  \ We talk about different theories in the metaphysics of sensory experience, including\
  \ na\xEFve realism, representationalism, and sense-datum theories. We detail Dr.\
  \ Papineau\u2019s qualitative view of sensory experience, and ask if it has anything\
  \ to say about concepts and consciousness. We talk about the distinction between\
  \ sensory experience and thought. Finally, we discuss if answering questions in\
  \ the metaphysics of sensory experience has any implications for metaphysics more\
  \ generally.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:26</time> What\
