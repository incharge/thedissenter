shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 3rd 2024.  \nDr. Luis Favela is an Associate Professor\
  \ of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences (tenured) at the University of Central Florida.\
  \ He is concurrently a Fellow in the Research Corporation for Science Advancement's\
  \ Molecular Basis of Cognition Scialog program. His research attempts to understand\
  \ mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary\
  \ perspective. He is the author of The Ecological Brain: Unifying the Sciences of\
  \ Brain, Body, and Environment.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Ecological Brain.\
  \ We first discuss ecological psychology, and neuroscience, how they split historically,\
  \ and why it seems hard to reconcile them. We talk about two traditions in neuroscience:\
  \ one focusing on biological features of neurons, and the other focusing on abstract\
  \ features of neurons. We discuss complexity science. We get into Dr. Favela\u2019\
  s NExT (NeuroEcological Nexus Theory) framework, the hypotheses derived from it,\
  \ and limitations of brain-centered approaches. We discuss what the ecological brain\
  \ is. Finally, we talk about the main challenges to the NExT framework, non-mechanistic\
  \ explanations, and the importance of interdisciplinarity.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00\
