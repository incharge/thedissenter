He has also recently published the book The Goodness Paradox: The Strange Relationship Between Virtue and Violence in Human Evolution (2019).\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the main topics of Dr. Wrangham’s latest book, The Goodness Paradox. We talk about the differences between reactive aggression and proactive aggression, comparing ourselves to other primates, and also evidence that comes from studies with hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists and other traditional human societies. Then, we discuss self-domestication, starting with the changes that usually occur both at the physical and the behavioral levels in domesticated species, and also some aspects of our sociality that might have favored self-domestication in our species, with focus on the role that capital punishment has played. Finally, we talk about group selection at the genetic and cultural levels, and also speculate a bit on the possibility of some gene-culture coevolution processes that were set in place after the advent of agriculture having contributed for the further reduction of reactive aggression in humans.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:15</time> What is the goodness paradox in humans?  \n<time>02:07</time> Reactive aggression and proactive aggression              \n<time>06:19</time> Comparing ourselves to other primates                           \n<time>08:56</time> Hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists                \n<time>15:15</time> Domestication and self-domestication                       \n<time>29:52</time> Are there aspects of sociality that influence self-domestication?                   \n<time>31:03</time> The role that fire and cooking might have played in human evolution  \n<time>34:43</time> Women banding together are not enough to explain self-domestication  \n<time>38:02</time> The role of language and cooperation  \n<time>41:10</time> About group selection (genetic and cultural)  \n<time>48:58</time> Cultural and social processes after the advent of agriculture to deal with violent behavior  \n<time>53:53</time> Follow Dr. Wrangham’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wrangham’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2TpMSZP  \nArticles of Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2NKQC1K  \nBooks: https://amzn.to/2NSWdDr  \nThe Goodness Paradox: https://amzn.to/2ER2JHH  \nKibale Chimpazee Project: https://bit.ly/2H42OKq\n\nReferenced books:  \nCatching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human: https://amzn.to/2TjSODn  \nDemonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence: https://amzn.to/2ERDGEu  \nThe Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined: https://amzn.to/2aY25WF  \nEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress: https://amzn.to/2FRJrj5\n",
