shownotes: "Dr. Bradley Campbell is an Associate Professor of Sociology at California\
  \ State University. He\u2019s also the author of books like The Geometry of Genocide,\
  \ and, more recently, The Rise of Victimhood Culture.  \nIn this episode, the conversation\
  \ centers around the book The Rise of Victimhood Culture, co-authored with Jason\
  \ Manning. We talk about the distinction between cultures of honor, cultures of\
  \ dignity, and cultures of victimhood; the historical precedents of victimhood culture\
  \ and the boom in 2013/2014; the religious aspects of victimhood culture; the influences\
  \ from postmodernism and Marxist conflict theories; the problem within sociology;\
  \ the role of moral status; the possibility of victimhood culture leading to political\
  \ tyranny; discrimination against conservative people; the manifestations of victimhood\
  \ culture on the right, and particularly the alt-right.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:26</time>\
