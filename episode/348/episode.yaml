  \ with a joint appointment in the Department of Philosophy and Lyman Briggs College\
  \ at Michigan State University. Her research examines philosophical issues in neuroscience\
  \ and in medicine, with a particular focus on the relationship between ethical and\

  \ of evidence-based practice and on the use of functional neuroimaging in psychiatry.\
  \ She is a co-editor of Neurofeminism: Issues at the Intersection of Feminist Theory\
  \ and Cognitive Science.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on the philosophy of medicine,\
  \ and the philosophy of neuroscience and the neuroscience of gender. We go through\
  \ some general topics in the philosophy of medicine, like evidence-based medicine,\
  \ if medicine is a science, how it is influenced by culture, the limitations of\
  \ the integration between research and practice, the difference between medicine\
  \ and healthcare, and how philosophy can improve healthcare practice. Then we get\
  \ into neuroscience, and refer to the limitations of current imaging techniques,\
  \ and discuss the neuroscience of gender, neurosexism, neurofeminism, and the impact\
  \ of studying sex differences on society.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time> What\
