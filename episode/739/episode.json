He is an evolutionary psychologist interested in anger and aggression, hatred, and formidability estimation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of the emotions of anger and hatred. We star by discussing emotions from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about anger, its functions, what triggers it, and cues of strength. We then get into hatred, how it differs from anger, and their relationship with revenge and conflict. We talk about how males assess fighting ability. We discuss if emotions are adaptations. Finally, we talk about justice-making institutions, and ask if criminal justice is based on punishment or repair.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:32</time> Understanding emotions from an evolutionary perspective  \n<time>03:51</time> The functions of anger  \n<time>07:11</time> What triggers anger  \n<time>14:44</time> Anger and cues of strength  \n<time>18:01</time> Hatred, and how it differ from anger  \n<time>29:06</time> Conflict  \n<time>33:16</time> Assessing fighting ability  \n<time>42:15</time> Are emotions adaptations?  \n<time>44:09</time> Justice-making institutions  \n<time>48:51</time> Is criminal justice based on punishment or repair?  \n<time>52:26</time> Follow Dr. Sell’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Sell’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3z2JMhh  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3O3mxIj\n",
