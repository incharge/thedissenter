He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Lyon, France. He’s also the author of books like Religion Explained; Memory, Mind and Culture; and Minds Make Societies.\n\nIn this episode, we focus mostly on the main topics of Minds Make Societies. We start off by talking about how we need to know how minds work if we want to understand how humans create societies. To set things off, we also refer to core knowledge, and to the flaws in the psychological literature on biases and heuristics. We then get into how human politics evolved, and the common threads that we find from small-scale hunter-gatherer and horticultural tribes to complex large-scale state societies. We also go over the evolution of gender roles, and their relationship with politics (patriarchy). In the last part of the conversation, we discuss the evolutionary psychology of religion, and some of the methodological problems with its approach. And we wrap it up with a question from my patron, Yzar Wehbe, about conspiratorial thinking.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:58</time> The premise of Minds Make Societies  \n<time>05:16</time> Our minds construct our reality  \n<time>16:08</time> About core knowledge                               \n<time>23:46</time> How biased and irrational are people, really?  \n<time>36:54</time> Human politics, from hunter-gatherer tribes to modern industrialized states  \n<time>58:34</time> Scaling up societies  \n<time>1:10:48</time> Gender roles and patriarchy  \n<time>1:32:53</time> The evolutionary psychology/anthropology of religion  \n<time>1:39:39</time> The trouble with social science research on belief and unbelief (religiosity and atheism)  \n<time>1:49:57</time> Studying the evolution of religion  \n<time>1:53:53</time> Question from my producer, Yzar Wehbe, about conspiratorial thinking  \n<time>2:00:57</time> Follow Dr. Boyer’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Boyer’s work:  \nFaculty Page: http://bit.ly/2XZHWbn  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2M1Knba  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2Ydywgw  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2JUZHDt  \nMinds Make Societies: How Cognition Explains the World Humans Create: https://amzn.to/2OlreUr\n",
