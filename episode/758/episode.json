  \ Professor of Philosophy at Temple University. Previously, he was an Andrew W.\
  \ Mellon fellow in the Humanities at Stanford University. He received his PhD in\
  \ philosophy from NYU. Dr. Alshanetsky's research and teaching interests are at\
  \ the intersection of the philosophy of mind and language, epistemology, and cognitive\
  \ science. He is the author of Articulating a Thought.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Articulating a Thought. We start by talking about self-knowledge, how people\
  \ acquire it, and how it is approached philosophically. We then get into articulation,\
  \ and the reasoning behind articulating a thought. We also discuss why some thoughts\
  \ are easy to articulate, while others are very hard, the limits of language, and\
  \ clarity of thought.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time>\
