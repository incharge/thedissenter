shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 31st 2022.  \nDr. Philip Dwyer is Professor in the\
  \ School of Humanities and Social Science at the University of Newcastle, Australia.\
  \ He has published widely on the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, including a\
  \ three-volume biography of Napoleon. He is the general editor of a four volume\
  \ Cambridge World History of Violence, and co-editor of the Cambridge History of\
  \ the Napoleonic Wars. He is the editor of The Darker Angels of Our Nature: Refuting\
  \ the Pinker Theory of History & Violence.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Darker\
  \ Angels of Our Nature. We present Steven Pinker\u2019s argument about trends in\
  \ violence across history. We then define \u201Cviolence\u201D, and talk about the\
  \ limitations of historical sources of data. We talk about forms of violence that\
  \ apparently have been on the rise recently. We discuss how to deal with death tolls\
  \ in war. We talk about the historical and cultural context of violence, Norbert\
  \ Elias\u2019 \u201Ccivilizing process\u201D, and the Enlightenment. Finally, we\
  \ talk about factors identified by historians that play a role in violence trends,\
  \ and ask if it is possible to objectively say that there has been moral progress.\n\
