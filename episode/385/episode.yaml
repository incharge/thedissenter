  \ the topic of conversation is Dr. Warne\u2019s new book, In the Know. We cover\
  \ some of the major topics of the book, including: g and IQ; what general intelligence\
  \ is; if IQ tests only work in the West, and are culture-specific; the evolution\
  \ of general intelligence; the neuroscience of IQ, and the P-FIT model; if there\
  \ any multiple intelligences, and we focus on Howard Gardner\u2019s multiple intelligences,\
  \ Daniel Goleman\u2019s emotional intelligence, and Stenberg\u2019s practical intelligence;\
  \ the behavioral genetics of intelligence; environmental factors that influence\
  \ IQ; social and educational interventions to raise IQ; explanations for the Flynn\
  \ effect; problems with the education system; the idea that everyone should go to\
  \ college; the lives of low-IQ people; sex differences; race differences; eugenics;\
  \ a g-informed education system; and predictions at the individual level, particularly\
  \ in regards to educational attainment.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:31</time> g and\
