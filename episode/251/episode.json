She is currently a senior lecturer of Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, as well as a member of the Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology group there. Her research interests are hormonal influences on behavior, human sexuality, disgust and, recently, the interface of evolutionary psychology and behaviorism.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of sex robots, and how they might impact men and human society. We talk about why men will be the primary marketing targets, and the several different ways sex robots might have a positive impact in their lives. During the discussion, we also tackle arguments against sex robots, or arguments that suggest their impact might be net negative. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:20</time> Evolutionary psychology, and sex robots as an emergent technology  \n<time>06:44</time> Could there be sex robots for women?  \n<time>10:30</time> Men tend to be systemizers  \n<time>16:01</time> The current mating market  \n<time>20:11</time> Men’s risky strategies  \n<time>26:41</time> Synthetic girlfriends  \n<time>31:52</time> Children and birth rates  \n<time>45:52</time> Could we use sex robots to train men’s social skills?   \n<time>53:55</time> The types of relationships that work for people  \n<time>1:00:34</time> What about the sex robots themselves?  \n<time>1:05:23</time> Follow Dr. Fleischman’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Fleischman’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2LhbPzC  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2KDv8DS  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2Z4h2jb  \nTwitter handle: @sentientist\n\nRelevant articles:  \nUncanny Vulvas: http://bit.ly/2TuikCX  \nWill Sex Robots Bring About the End of Civilization?
