  \ the following topics: the seven fundamental motives; stone-age brains; how the\
  \ fundamental motives are organized; a fulfilling human life; how certain problems\
  \ are harder in industrialized societies; survival; health issues; consumer choice;\
  \ making and keeping friends; modern mating, and the paradox of choice; attracting\
  \ mates; human mating systems; acquiring status; economic inequality, and its social\
  \ effects; retaining a mate; taking care of family members; and being kind to others.\n\
