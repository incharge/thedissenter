You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/engIPGdURnY\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Visions of Inequality. We start by talking about how long people have been thinking about economic inequality, and the elements of the best income distribution studies. We then go through the work of authors like François Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Vilfredo Pareto, and Simon Kuznets, and how there was a natural progression across them. We discuss how and why studies of income distribution went into retreat during the Cold War era; the rise of neoliberalism and its consequences; and what led to the revival of economic studies. We also talk about a recent expansion in our understanding of the dynamics of inequality, with race and gender inequality. Finally, we discuss Dr. Milanović’s goals with this book.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time> How long have people been thinking about economic inequality?  \n<time>02:53</time> The best income distribution studies  \n<time>06:13</time> François Quesnay  \n<time>09:23</time> Adam Smith  \n<time>11:29</time> David Ricardo  \n<time>13:57</time> Karl Marx  \n<time>21:29</time> Vilfredo Pareto  \n<time>25:17</time> Simon Kuznets  \n<time>28:52</time> A natural progression across the authors  \n<time>31:37</time> How studies of income distribution went into retreat during the Cold War era  \n<time>36:50</time> The rise of neoliberalism  \n<time>40:16</time> The revival of inequality studies  \n<time>43:37</time> Expanding our understanding of the dynamics of inequality: race and gender inequality  \n<time>47:55</time> Reframing the way we think about the study of economic inequality  \n<time>53:21</time> Follow Dr. Milanović’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Milanović’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3BnC2Fb  \nBlog: https://bit.ly/3BogTM0  \nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3Ly0Znb  \nVisions of Inequality: https://amzn.to/446Zjtt  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2WtDJS6  \nTwitter handle: @BrankoMilan\n",
