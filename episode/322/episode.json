Dr. Marean’s research interests focus on the origins of modern humans, the prehistory of Africa, the study of animal bones from archaeological sites and climates and environments of the past. In the area of the origins of modern humans, he is particularly interested in questions about foraging strategies and the evolution of modern human behavior. He has a special interest in human occupation of grassland and coastal ecosystems.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about zooarchaeology, and Integrating paleoanthropology, paleoclimate and paleoenvironments. We then discuss the importance of stone tools and fire in human evolution. We also refer to what it is to be a modern human. We address the limitations of foraging models. We explore how culture might have evolved in humans. Finally, we talk about our possible origins and migrations.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:59</time> What is zooarchaeology?  \n<time>11:58</time> The importance of stone tools  \n<time>18:52</time> The cognitive revolution  \n<time>21:44</time> What is it to be a modern human?  \n<time>24:25</time> The role of fire  \n<time>29:09</time> Foraging strategies  \n<time>34:37</time> The evolution of culture  \n<time>39:16</time> The subpopulation we evolved from  \n<time>43:12</time> New study: “Human origins in a southern African paleo-wetland and first migrations”  \n<time>46:30</time> Why was H. sapiens the only hominin species that spread across the entire globe?  \n<time>51:46</time> Is H. sapiens an invasive species?  \n<time>56:41</time> Follow Dr. Marean’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Marean’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2PohGqd  \nScientific contributions on ResearchGate: http://bit.ly/2Pn2ysM\n\nReferenced paper: https://go.nature.com/2ueh92i\n",
