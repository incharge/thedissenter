  \nIn this episode, we talk about Unassailable Ideas. We start with the thesis of\
  \ the book, and discuss some statistics. Other topics include: cancel culture; where\
  \ these ideas stem from; the role of universities; how these ideas move from campus\
  \ to politics and the general public; how social media exacerbate the problem; research;\
  \ and viewpoint diversity. Finally, we ask if the SJWs could be (morally) right,\
  \ and discuss some of the best solutions to these issues.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
