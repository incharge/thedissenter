We start by talking about the most common misconceptions people have about how capitalism works. We then discuss how businesses are planned, the importance of labor movements, how companies get state support, and how countries from the global North exploit countries from the global South. We discuss what \u201cfreedom\u201d means, and how people can democratize institutions and take back control. Finally, we talk about the current state of the world, and reasons for being optimistic.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:25</time> Common misconceptions about capitalism  \n<time>08:37</time> How businesses are planned  \n<time>18:27</time> The importance of labor movements  \n<time>27:12</time> How companies get state support  \n<time>31:48</time> How countries from the global North exploit countries from the global South  \n<time>38:11</time> What does freedom mean?  \n<time>42:36</time> How people can take back control  \n<time>53:49</time> The current state of the world, and reasons for being optimistic  \n<time>59:57</time> Follow Grace\u2019s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Grace\u2019s work:  \nWebsite: https://tinyurl.com/spj33erd  \nVulture Capitalism: https://tinyurl.com/4ycbej3m  \nTwitter handle: @graceblakeley\n",
