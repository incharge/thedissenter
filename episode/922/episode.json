He is the author of several books, the latest one being Conscious Mind, Resonant Brain: How Each Brain Makes a Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Conscious Mind, Resonant Brain. We start by talking about how physics and psychology split in the approach to the brain; the mind-body problem; and whether our brains are like computers. We talk about perception and awareness, visual illusions and art, how we go from seeing to recognizing and to predicting, the relationship between emotion and cognition, and how we get unified moments of conscious awareness. We discuss the role of the prefrontal cortex, learning, the evolution of the brain, theories of consciousness, and the hard problem of consciousness. We talk about mental disorders, irrational decisions, and the design of AI systems. Finally, we discuss morality and the human condition, the unification of psychology and physics, and potential laws of biology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:54</time> How physics and psychology split in approaching the brain  \n<time>05:41</time> The mind-body problem  \n<time>18:39</time> Are our brains like computers?  \n<time>22:01</time> Perception and awareness  \n<time>31:42</time> Visual illusions and art  \n<time>54:14</time> From seeing to recognizing and to predicting  \n<time>59:40</time> The relationship between emotion and cognition  \n<time>1:02:53</time> Unified moments of conscious awareness  \n<time>1:04:26</time> The prefrontal cortex  \n<time>1:07:05</time> Learning  \n<time>1:17:06</time> The evolution of the brain  \n<time>1:20:29</time> Theories of consciousness  \n<time>1:25:50</time> The hard problem of consciousness  \n<time>1:32:10</time> Mental disorders, and irrational decisions  \n<time>1:42:42</time> Designing AI systems  \n<time>1:51:57</time> Morality and the human condition  \n<time>1:55:51</time> Unifying psychology and physics  \n<time>2:03:32</time> Laws of biology?  \n<time>2:08:35</time> Follow Dr. Grossberg’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Grissberg’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3RZlAGK  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3RTzQRb  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3sU0lvS  \nConscious Mind, Resonant Brain: https://bit.ly/3PNNiTO\n",
