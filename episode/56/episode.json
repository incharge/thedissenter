We talk about evolutionary theory as the basis of morality; the shortcomings of reason; the is-ought dichotomy; the properties of moral axioms; the ethics of religion; the internal contradictions of moral relativism; the condition of nihilism; free will and personal responsibility; truth and cruelty; pleasure in ethics; religion, science, and the meaning of life; the philosophical problem of immortality; and the relationship between beauty, truth, and morality. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:05</time> What is metaethics?  \n<time>04:05</time> Evolutionary theory as the basis of morality    \n<time>10:41</time> The trouble with reason    \n<time>22:53</time> The is-ought problem    \n<time>29:36</time> About moral axioms    \n<time>38:50</time> The ethics of religion    \n<time>42:28</time> Contradictions of moral relativism    \n<time>47:45</time> Nihilism    \n<time>52:49</time> Free will and personal responsibility    \n<time>57:50</time> Can truth be cruel?  \n<time>1:01:45</time> Pleasure in ethics  \n<time>1:05:30</time> Religion, science, and the meaning of life  \n<time>1:09:04</time> Immortality  \n<time>1:11:21</time> How is beauty related to truth and morality?  \n<time>1:17:18</time> Follow Dr. Blackburn’s work  \n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Blackburn’s work:  \nWebsite: http://www2.phil.cam.ac.uk/~swb24/  \nBooks: https://www.amazon.com/default/e/B000APFM0S\n",
