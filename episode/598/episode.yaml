  \nIn this episode, we focus on Philosophy of Psychedelics. We start by giving an\
  \ overview of the main topics and questions explored in the philosophy of psychedelics.\
  \ We then go through epistemology, psychedelic therapy, the neurobiology of psychedelics,\
  \ changes to the sense of self, and autobiographical changes. We discuss epistemic\
  \ risks and benefits of psychedelic therapy. Finally, we talk about spiritual experiences\
  \ from a naturalistic point of view.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
