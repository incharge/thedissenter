excerpt: 'Dr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University
  of Groningen. In her current research, she is inspired by critical psychology and
  discursive psychology in her attempt to study the ontology or process mechanisms
  of self and identity (and related concepts) as situated in time and context. In
  much of her research, she adopts a complex dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic
  or theoretical work. She is the author, together with Paul van Geert, of Toward

shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2023.  \nDr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Groningen. In her current research, she is\
  \ inspired by critical psychology and discursive psychology in her attempt to study\
  \ the ontology or process mechanisms of self and identity (and related concepts)\
  \ as situated in time and context. In much of her research, she adopts a complex\
  \ dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic or theoretical work. She is the author,\
  \ together with Paul van Geert, of Toward a Process Approach in Psychology: Stepping\
  \ into Heraclitus' River.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Toward a Process Approach\
  \ in Psychology. We talk about the dominant substance ontology approach in psychology,\
  \ and an alternative process approach. We discuss dynamical systems theory, and\
  \ how science is done. We talk about the study of self-esteem. We discuss the use\
  \ of \u201Crepresentative samples\u201D; intervention causality, and randomized\
  \ controlled trials; the measurement problem in psychology; and how to deal with\
  \ variability. Finally, we talk about how a process approach can reframe the way\
  \ we think about the replication crisis in psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
