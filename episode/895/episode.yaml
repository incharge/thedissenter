excerpt: 'Dr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University

  discursive psychology in her attempt to study the ontology or process mechanisms

  much of her research, she adopts a complex dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic
  or theoretical work. She is the author, together with Paul van Geert, of Toward

shownotes: "RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2023.  \nDr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor\
  \ of Psychology at the University of Groningen. In her current research, she is\
  \ inspired by critical psychology and discursive psychology in her attempt to study\
  \ the ontology or process mechanisms of self and identity (and related concepts)\
  \ as situated in time and context. In much of her research, she adopts a complex\
  \ dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic or theoretical work. She is the author,\
  \ together with Paul van Geert, of Toward a Process Approach in Psychology: Stepping\
  \ into Heraclitus' River.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Toward a Process Approach\
  \ in Psychology. We talk about the dominant substance ontology approach in psychology,\
  \ and an alternative process approach. We discuss dynamical systems theory, and\
  \ how science is done. We talk about the study of self-esteem. We discuss the use\
  \ of \u201Crepresentative samples\u201D; intervention causality, and randomized\
  \ controlled trials; the measurement problem in psychology; and how to deal with\
  \ variability. Finally, we talk about how a process approach can reframe the way\
  \ we think about the replication crisis in psychology.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 \
