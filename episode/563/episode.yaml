  \ at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. He studies the evolution\
  \ of mate choice, the costs of being attractive, sexual conflict, the reason animals\
  \ age and the links between sex, diet, obesity and death. He is the author of Sex,\
  \ Genes & Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World, and,\
  \ more recently, Artificial Intimacy: Virtual Friends, Digital Lovers, and Algorithmic\
  \ Matchmakers.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Artificial Intimacy. We talk about\
  \ why a biologist would focus on sex technology. We go through the biology of intimacy,\
  \ and the biology of love and romantic relationships, and how new technology exploits\
  \ them. We discuss the effects technology might have on mating strategies, and on\
  \ gender roles. We talk about the incel movement, and some equivalents in Japan,\
  \ and how in Japan people deal with romantic rejection differently. Finally, we\
  \ talk about how lowering the price of sex might be good, and how technology can\
  \ help with that.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:45</time>\
