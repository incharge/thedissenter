He is Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy, Foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and member of the Academia Europaea. He has been the first laureate of the Claude Lévi-Strauss Prize in 2009. He is the author of numerous articles in anthropology, linguistics, philosophy and psychology and of several books, including Meaning and Relevance (with Deirdre Wilson), Relevance: Communication and Cognition (with Deirdre Wilson), and The Enigma of Reason (with Hugo Mercier).\n\nIn this episode, we talk about cultural evolution, cultural attraction theory, epistemic vigilance, and reason. We start by talking about how human cognition is best understood in a social context, and how to think about the relationship between culture and biology. We then get into Dr. Sperber’s “epidemiology of representations”, and into cultural attraction theory, and how it related to Robert Boyd’s and Peter Richerson’s approach to cultural evolution. We discuss the limitations of memetics, and if we can say that cultural evolution is Darwinian. We talk about epistemic vigilance, and the argumentative theory of reasoning. Finally, Dr. Sperber tells us about his take on massive modularity of the human mind, and why reason is modular.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:42</time> Studying human cognition in a social context  \n<time>06:00</time> Culture and biology  \n<time>07:33</time> Epidemiology of representations  \n<time>21:23</time> Cultural attraction theory, and its relationship to Boyd’s and Richerson’s approach  \n<time>32:24</time> Is cultural evolution, Darwinian?  \n<time>36:02</time> The limitations of memetics  \n<time>45:46</time> Epistemic vigilance  \n<time>51:17</time> Are people gullible  \n<time>53:59</time> Reason, and argumentation  \n<time>1:01:24</time> Massive modularity of the human mind, and the modularity of reason  \n<time>1:10:22</time> Follow Dr. Sperber’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Sperber’s work:  \nUniversity page (CNRS): https://bit.ly/3Ax0lzG  \nFaculty page (CEU): https://bit.ly/3fjthDP  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3ariwvG  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3vkq7Fx  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3hVEqwa\n",
