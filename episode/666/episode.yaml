shownotes: "RECORDED ON MAY 25th 2022.  \nDr. Luana Maroja is Professor of Biology\
  \ at Williams College. She is interested in the evolution of barriers to gene exchange,\
  \ speciation, population genetics and phylogeography. Her study systems are crickets\
  \ (Gryllus), artic plants and butterflies (heliconius).\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about gene exchange, adaptation, speciation, and phylogeography. We start with\
  \ gene exchange, and talk about how it occurs, gene transfers between species, and\
  \ barriers to gene exchange. We talk about modular expression of genes. We discuss\
  \ adaptations, how we can understand their evolution, and how to identify genes\
  \ associated with them. We talk about speciation, and how we know it is occurring.\
  \ We also talk about phylogeography, landscape genetics, and what leads to more\
  \ diversity of species.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:43</time>\
