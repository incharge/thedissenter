shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 25th 2022.  \nDr. Christian B. Miller is the A. C.\
  \ Reid Professor of Philosophy at Wake Forest University. His research is primarily\
  \ in contemporary ethics and philosophy of religion. He has written for the Wall\
  \ Street Journal, Dallas Morning News, Slate, Prospect Magazine, Relevant Magazine,\
  \ Michael Hyatt Magazine, The Conversation, Newsweek, Aeon, Greater Good Magazine,\
  \ Nautilus Magazine, Fathom Magazine, Institute of Art and Ideas, and Christianity\
  \ Today. He\u2019s the author of several books, the most recent one being Honesty:\
  \ The Philosophy and Psychology of a Neglected Virtue.\n\nIn this episode, we focus\
  \ on Honesty. We start by discussing what makes something a virtue, and what honesty\
  \ is. We talk about behaviors that are incompatible with honesty, with a focus on\
  \ lying, cheating, and stealing. We also talk about cases where there is conflict\
  \ with other moral values. We discuss who counts as an honest person, and we get\
  \ into contextual factors and intentionality. We refer to the particular cases of\
  \ promise-making, and omission. We ask if one can be too honest. We go through some\
  \ psychological studies on honesty, environmental factors, and possible interventions\
  \ to promote it. Finally, we discuss if the virtues have been neglected in Philosophy.\n\
