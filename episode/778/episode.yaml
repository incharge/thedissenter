shownotes: "Dr. Carles Lalueza-Fox is Director of the Natural Science Museum in Barcelona.\
  \ He participated in the Neanderthal Genome Project and led the first retrieval\
  \ of the genome of an 8,000-year-old European hunter-gatherer. He is the author\
  \ of Inequality: A Genetic History.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Inequality.\
  \ We start by talking about the premise of the book, and the current state of global\
  \ inequality, with its social and political consequences. We get into the scientific\
  \ tools we can use to study inequality in the past. We discuss sexual selection\
  \ and assortative mating; if inequality is the result of individual traits or social\
  \ structures; unequal patterns of reproduction; and the transition from foraging\
  \ to agriculture. We discuss if the concept of \u201Crace\u201D makes sense in genetics.\
  \ We talk about archaeology; patrilocality and high female mobility; a gender bias\
  \ in reproduction; and mating systems (polygyny and monogamy). We go through two\
  \ examples of historical events that shaped population genetics and inequality,\
  \ including the European colonization of the Americas and the slave trade across\
  \ the Atlantic, and the Mongol empire. We discuss the impact of gene-editing techniques\
  \ on science and society. Finally, we talk about the future of inequality, and discuss\
  \ if inequality is an inevitable feature of human society.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
