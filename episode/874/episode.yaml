  \nIn this episode, we talk about misinformation. We start by discussing what misinformation\
  \ is. We talk about perceived source similarity and perceived source credibility.\
  \ We discuss if liberals and conservatives are equally susceptible to misinformation.\
  \ We talk about motivated cognition. We discuss inattention accounts of the sharing\
  \ of fake news. We get into interventions to reduce susceptibility to fake news,\
  \ and discuss how they are measured; debunking and prebunking approaches; inoculation\
  \ theory; fact-based and technique-based approaches; and how effective inoculation\
  \ against misinformation is. We also talk about Cecilie\u2019s current work.\n\n\
