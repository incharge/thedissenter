  Broadly speaking her research focuses on how groups act as sources of influence
  on our judgments and beliefs: including how intergroup biases impact our ability
  to assess the veracity of information, and how social cues and interactions with
  other people affect individual-level cognition.'

shownotes: "RECORDED ON AUGUST 4th 2023.  \nCecilie Traberg is a Psychology PhD Candidate\
  \ in the Social Decision-Making Lab at the University of Cambridge supervised by\
  \ Professor Sander van der Linden where her work seeks to bridge the fields of social\
  \ influence and cognitive science. Broadly speaking her research focuses on how\

  \nIn this episode, we talk about misinformation. We start by discussing what misinformation\
  \ is. We talk about perceived source similarity and perceived source credibility.\
  \ We discuss if liberals and conservatives are equally susceptible to misinformation.\
  \ We talk about motivated cognition. We discuss inattention accounts of the sharing\
  \ of fake news. We get into interventions to reduce susceptibility to fake news,\
  \ and discuss how they are measured; debunking and prebunking approaches; inoculation\
  \ theory; fact-based and technique-based approaches; and how effective inoculation\
  \ against misinformation is. We also talk about Cecilie\u2019s current work.\n\n\
