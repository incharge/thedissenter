  \ in the Department of Anthropology at University College London. Over many years,\
  \ he has been exploring the idea that human language and culture emerged in our\
  \ species not purely through gradual Darwinian evolution but in a cumulative process\
  \ culminating in sudden revolutionary change. The details of his \u2018sex strike\u2019\

  \ human revolution) has been current for many years and is now widely agreed.\n\n\
  In this episode, we talk about Dr. Knight\u2019s hypothesis about the emergence\
  \ of human language. We discuss the social conditions that are needed for language\
  \ to develop, and tackle questions surrounding language nativism and why other animals\
  \ do not have language. We also get into cultural evolution, and its relationship\
  \ with matrilocality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time>\
