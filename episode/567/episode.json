Over many years, he has been exploring the idea that human language and culture emerged in our species not purely through gradual Darwinian evolution but in a cumulative process culminating in sudden revolutionary change. The details of his ‘sex strike’ theory remain controversial, but the general idea that the transition to language was a ‘major transition’ or ‘revolution’ (often termed the human revolution) has been current for many years and is now widely agreed.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about Dr. Knight’s hypothesis about the emergence of human language. We discuss the social conditions that are needed for language to develop, and tackle questions surrounding language nativism and why other animals do not have language. We also get into cultural evolution, and its relationship with matrilocality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> The evolution of language  \n<time>04:48</time> Language nativism  \n<time>08:02</time> The social foundations of language  \n<time>14:31</time> Language in other animals  \n<time>16:55</time> The origins of language  \n<time>22:25</time> Michael Tomasello, and human development  \n<time>27:57</time> The evolution of languages  \n<time>30:16</time> Human culture  \n<time>35:49</time> Are human societies matrilocal or patrilocal?  \n<time>42:59</time> Could we lose language?  \n<time>47:03</time> Follow Dr. Knight’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Knight’s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3pu7mwr  \nScience and Revolution blog: https://bit.ly/3zeBIae  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3A08bSV\n",
