We start off by addressing the differences in terms of theoretical foundations and methodology between traditional Archaeology and Darwinian Archaeology. Then, we talk about we talk about some basilar aspects of the study of cultures, like the importance of innovation, how to delimitate cultures from one another, and “folk science”. In the second part of the interview, we discuss the origins and spread of agriculture, as informed by archaeological findings. We talk about how agriculture spread through Europe, and aspects related to demography, diet, famine and disease. At the end, Dr. Shennan also explains what the Neolithic was about. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:58</time> What is Darwinian Archaeology, and how it differs from traditional Archaeology?  \n<time>06:03</time> The importance of innovation in human culture                             \n<time>08:37</time> How do we delimitate cultures from one another?                             \n<time>12:42</time> Sources for archaeological studies                             \n<time>14:49</time> Folk science                         \n<time>17:15</time> Does the methodology vary according to the society and historical period under study?                        \n<time>19:45</time> Archaeology and human psychology                \n<time>22:26</time> The origins and spread of agriculture          \n<time>31:36</time> Agriculture in Europe                    \n<time>38:04</time> Group selection in the spread of agriculture  \n<time>41:05</time> Agriculture, demography and innovation  \n<time>43:46</time> Agriculture, diet, famine and disease  \n<time>48:00</time> What is the Neolithic, and what is it characterized for?  \n<time>51:56</time> Follow Dr. Shennan’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Shennan’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/2JJ7nvM  \nArticles on Researchgate: https://bit.ly/2Xw556c  \nAcademia.edu profile: https://bit.ly/2FGbEwd  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/2Ot9hiV\n\nReferrenced books/articles:  \nGenes, Memes and Human History: https://amzn.to/2uwm7UE  \nMapping Our Ancestors: https://amzn.to/2TXYrYl  \nThe First Farmers of Europe: https://amzn.to/2TYGYPy\n",
