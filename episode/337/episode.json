She is a cognitive scientist and empirical philosopher & historian of science, technology, and the senses. She divides her brain-time between the Department of History & Philosophy of Science and the Cognitive Science Program. Estimated begin of lab (EEG/Olfactometry) in early 2021. She’s the author of Smellosophy: What the Nose tells the Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we start off by talking about the scientific method, how it evolved over time, the difficulties in defining or characterizing it. We refer to the fact that different branches of science and of philosophy of science approach their objects of study in different ways; the place for fiction in science, and how we should think about modelling in science; empirical success; a minority view on the replication crisis, and the importance of failure in the scientific process; falsification, and the demarcation problem. Then, we get into Dr. Barwich’s work on the sense of olfaction, how it works, and a new view it gives us of how the brain works more broadly, and also how it reframes certain questions and big topics in the philosophy of neuroscience.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:46</time> How to define the scientific method  \n<time>03:16</time> Different branches of science and philosophy of science  \n<time>13:29</time> Is there a place for fiction in science?  \n<time>17:21</time> What is empirical success in science?  \n<time>21:03</time> Is the replication crisis a real crisis?
