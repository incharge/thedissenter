He conducts research on language and cognition, writes for publications such as the New York Times, Time and The Atlantic, and is the author of ten books, including The Language Instinct, How The Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, The Better Angels of Our Nature, The Sense of Style, and most recently, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.\n\nIn this episode, we go through some of the main topics Dr. Pinker tackles in his work. We start by discussing a new hypothesis put forth by Joe Henrich and his collaborators, about the possible influence the Catholic Church had on the evolution of our WEIRD psychology and the Enlightenment ideas. We then talk about cultural evolution, morality from an evolutionary perspective, and human progress. We also address if our folk psychology tracks scientific findings on human behavior. We also talk about language, and AI. Finally, we go through two questions coming from a patron, about the cognitive niche hypothesis, and the WEIRD problem.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:44</time> The Catholic Church and the Enlightenment  \n<time>07:40</time> Where did the ideas of the Enlightenment come from?  \n<time>10:39</time> On cultural evolution and human nature  \n<time>17:31</time> Morality from an evolutionary perspective  \n<time>25:13</time> Can we backslide in terms of human progress?  \n<time>30:28</time> Does our folk psychology track scientific findings?  \n<time>36:04</time> About the idea of massive modularity of the human mind  \n<time>39:54</time> Language  \n<time>43:46</time> What if we were to reproduce the human brain in an artificial medium?  \n<time>47:11</time> Questions from patrons (the cognitive niche hypothesis, and the WEIRD problem)  \n<time>51:33</time> Follow Dr. Pinker’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Pinker’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2Nx4rC6  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3abIVMN  \nResearchGate profile: http://bit.ly/2RkTcxI  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2R02Er6  \nTwitter handle: @sapinker\n",
