He is the coauthor, together with Debra Lieberman, of the book Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law.\n\nThis is the second episode where I talk about the book Objection: Disgust Morality, and the Law. The first one was with the other coauthor, Dr. Debra Lieberman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7KCXBPvRlg).   \nIn this episode, we talk about the legal aspects of the book. First, Dr. Patrick tells us about his take of the evolved domains of disgust – pathogen, sexual, and moral. We then talk about how we formulate laws based on disgust, or how we go from “gross” to “wrong”. We also discuss the important distinction between laws and social norms. We get into the very contentious discussion about if legal systems are moral. Dr. Patrick gives a few examples of legal areas that are influenced by disgust, like obscenity and sexual relationships. We finally explore if disgust should be used as a criterion to create laws, and also if jurors and judges should be exposed to evidential material that triggers disgust. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:16</time> The domains of disgust  \n<time>05:15</time> Going from “gross” to “wrong”  \n<time>11:54</time> The difference between laws, taboos and social norms  \n<time>20:15</time> Are legal systems moral?                               \n<time>26:42</time> Obscenity, sexual relationships, and other areas where laws are influenced by disgust  \n<time>37:30</time> Should we use disgust as a criteria to write laws?  \n<time>40:46</time> What about other emotions?  \n<time>46:55</time> The is-ought dichotomy  \n<time>51:18</time> Should jurors and judges be exposed to disgusting evidential material?  \n<time>58:28</time> Follow Dr. Patrick’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Patrick’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/32XZ9FK  \nSSRN profile: http://bit.ly/2YtrekJ  \nObjection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law: https://amzn.to/2GDMKgN\n\nInterview w/ Dr. Debra Lieberman, “Disgust, Morality, and the Law”: http://bit.ly/2KftkzE\n",
