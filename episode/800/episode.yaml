shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 19th 2023.  \nDr. Daisy Dixon is a philosopher of art\
  \ and an artist, and a Lecturer in Philosophy at Cardiff University. Her research\
  \ falls at the intersection of philosophy of art, philosophy of language, and political\
  \ philosophy. She explores how visual art behaves like speech, and how curators\
  \ and interpreters can affect what an artwork communicates to its audience. Her\
  \ current project concerns unjust aesthetics and aesthetic injustice, focusing on\
  \ artistic hate speech, aesthetic \u2018counterspeech\u2019, and deceptive art.\
  \ Her teaching interests span aesthetics, philosophy of language, ethics, and feminist\
  \ philosophy. She is also a practicing artist in paint and sound.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we go through topics at the intersection of philosophy of art and political philosophy.\
  \ We start by discussing what it means for an artwork to have meaning, if it makes\
  \ sense to think that it would have one single meaning independent of context, the\
  \ influence of culture, how meaning changes over time, and the role that curators\
  \ play. We talk about how artworks can be speech acts, and how art can lie. We discuss\
  \ artistic hate speech, the political role that art can play, and aesthetic counterspeech\
  \ as an alternative to censorship. We then discuss immoral artists, how we can determine\
  \ that an artist is morally problematic, and we should deal with their artworks.\
  \ Finally, we talk about the politics and ethics of museums.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
