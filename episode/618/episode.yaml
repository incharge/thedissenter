  \ at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University. He is\
  \ interested in comparative methodology across the natural and social sciences.\
  \ He is the author of books like Post-Truth, and The Scientific Attitude: Defending\
  \ Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience. His new book is How to Talk to\

  \ Who Defy Reason.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on How to Talk to a Science Denier.\
  \ We characterize a science denier, and talk about the five tropes of science denial.\
  \ We discuss how politics and ideology influence science denial. We talk about the\
  \ strategies people can use to engage with science deniers. We discuss the social\
  \ aspects of science denial. We talk about philosophers who deny the epistemology\
  \ of science. We talk about how science tends to be counterintuitive, and what to\
  \ do when there is not enough information. We discuss the different types of science\
  \ deniers. Finally, Dr. McIntyre gives us a guide on how to first approach a science\
  \ denier.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:34</time> What\
