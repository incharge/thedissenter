  \ professor of economics at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy\
  \ in the Argyros School of Business and Economics at Chapman University. His research\
  \ uses experiments to explore the underpinnings of prosociality, cooperation and\
  \ conflict resolution and to identify the origins of economic institutions such\

  \ the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual theory of mind, and\
  \ capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and trade, among other\
  \ topics.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about behavioral economics. We start with\
  \ norms, their origins, and why do people follow them. We also talk about institutions,\
  \ personal and impersonal exchange, specialization, and theory of mind. Toward the\
  \ end, we talk about organ donations, and adolescent smoking.\n\nTime Links:  \n\
