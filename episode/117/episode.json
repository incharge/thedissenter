Topics include: the Big Five, and other personality traits inventories; the reliability of personality measures; the many ways genetics and the environment interact to build up our psychology; how our psychological traits are polygenic (influences by several genes); the influences of parents and other aspects of the environment; the effects of IQ and personality in old age, and the long-term benefits of high IQ and certain personality traits, like conscientiousness. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:22</time> Big Five and other personality inventories  \n<time>06:09</time> The earliest point in life to measure personality                    \n<time>09:27</time> Are questionnaires and reports reliable?                  \n<time>14:31</time> The interplay between genetics and the environment             \n<time>18:09</time> Studies with twins and adoptees             \n<time>19:57</time> The trouble with identifying genes associated with psychological traits      \n<time>22:56</time> Are genetic effects greater after people leave their parents’ house?  \n<time>27:01</time> Rich vs impoverished environments, and their effects    \n<time>30:51</time> Old age, mental health, and personality      \n<time>33:33</time> The long-term benefits of high IQ  \n<time>37:14</time> Intelligence and health  \n<time>43:12</time> But intelligence is not the same as wisdom.
