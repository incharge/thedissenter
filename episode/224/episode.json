Dr. Gelfand gives us a definition of tight and loose culture, and then we explore the several different aspects that go associated with the tightness-looseness continuum. We explore its relationship with other ways of approaching culture, like the individualism-collectivism continuum, and if there is any relationship with the Big Five personality traits. We also refer to the divide in the US between the northern and the southern states. We talk about how normative behavior arises in early stages of development in children. Toward the end, we discuss the relationship between tightness and looseness and some health outcomes, and how we can use this framework to potentially solve some relevant contemporary issues, like political polarization. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:05</time> What are tight and loose cultures?  \n<time>08:35</time> What produces these types of psychology?  \n<time>13:17</time> Tightness-looseness, and its relationship to individualism-collectivism                               \n<time>16:41</time> Does this continuum also operate at the level of individuals?  \n<time>19:36</time> Is there any relationship with the Big Five personality traits?  \n<time>21:41</time> No system is unconditionally better than the other  \n<time>24:50</time> Tightness-looseness in the US (northern and southern states)  \n<time>27:06</time> Divergence between the working class and the upper class  \n<time>29:58</time> Children are normative beings  \n<time>33:31</time> Tightness-looseness and health outcomes  \n<time>39:58</time> Extremes of tightness and looseness produce the worst results  \n<time>41:56</time> Using this cultural framework to tackle current political and social issues  \n<time>47:21</time> Follow Dr. Gelfand’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Gelfand’s work:  \nFaculty Page: https://bit.ly/2xRVvPv  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/2KU4YPx  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/2VbZbIX  \nBooks on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2XRomhl  \nRule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World: https://amzn.to/2JCIFvf  \nTwitter handle: @MicheleJGelfand\n",
