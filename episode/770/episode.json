  \ we start by talking about embodied and enactive cognitive science.  We discuss\
  \ an enactive-dynamic model of cognition, and how to think about psychological traits.\
  \ We get into an enactive account of culture, and how psychological experiences\
  \ are interpreted in particular cultural contexts. We also discuss social cognition\
  \ from an enactivist perspective, and the role of theory of mind. We then talk about\
  \ enactive artificial intelligence. We discuss why technology is not neutral, and\
  \ feminist technoscience principles. We address a question from a patron regarding\
  \ AI and human cognition. Finally, we talk about the need for cognitive and cultural\
  \ diversity in science.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>01:05</time>\
