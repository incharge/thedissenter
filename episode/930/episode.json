She is a historian, specializing in the history of food and colonial and 19th-century Spanish America. She is the author of books like “The Body of the Conquistador: Food, Race and the Colonial Experience in Spanish America, 1492-1700”, “Potato”, and “Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato”.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the history and politics of the potato. We start by talking about the origins of the potato, how good it is as a crop, and the status of potatoes in South America. We then discuss how the potato came to Europe and spread across the globe. We talk about the political significance of nutrition in the Enlightenment and the modern era. We discuss the Great Famine in Ireland and the response of the British government, and different political views about the potato. Finally, we discuss attempts by governments to regulate the food market, how people react to them, and whether we really choose what we eat.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> The origins of the potato  \n<time>02:01</time> How good are potatoes as a crop?  \n<time>05:19</time> The status of potatoes in South America  \n<time>09:06</time> How the potato came to Europe  \n<time>12:07</time> How long did it take for Europeans to include potatoes in their diet?  \n<time>17:09</time> The political significance of nutrition in the Enlightenment and the modern era  \n<time>27:26</time> The Great Famine in Ireland, and the response of the British government  \n<time>34:24</time> Different political views about the potato: nourishment, poverty, and capitalist exploitation  \n<time>38:15</time> Attempts by governments to regulate the food market, and how people react to them  \n<time>44:06</time> Do we really choose what we eat?  \n<time>51:06</time> Follow Dr. Earle’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Earle’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3GJkoAw  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3p5jSaE  \nAcademia.edu page: https://bit.ly/3MOCm8G  \nBooks on Amazon: https://bit.ly/3Jhu6LT\n",
