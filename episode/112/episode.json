  \ we talk about sex differences in cognitive abilities, some issues we have to take\
  \ into account, the biopsychosocial model, and the biological and social aspects\
  \ of \u201Cgender\u201D. We also refer to the gender wage gap, and striking a balance\
  \ between one\u2019s professional and personal lives, and if the proposal of going\
  \ back to same-sex schooling has any merit. Finally, we talk about critical thinking,\
  \ the types of skills that it involves, how we can teach them to people (children\
  \ and adults), and about creativity.  \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:58</time> Why\
