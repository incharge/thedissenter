  \nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of consciousness and intelligence.\
  \ We start with consciousness, and discuss the fact that it does not have a universal\
  \ definition, and if that\u2019s problematic; evolutionary approaches to it; the\
  \ self; if we should take people\u2019s reports of their own consciousness seriously;\
  \ if any version of mind-brain dualism can still be relevant; if we can know for\
  \ sure that other animals are conscious, and what we can learn from their behavior.\
  \ We then also discuss the evolution of intelligence, and the importance of social\
  \ life both for consciousness and intelligence. Finally, Dr. Humphrey gives us his\
  \ account of the evolution of suicide, and its relationship with consciousness.\n\
