shownotes: "RECORDED ON JUNE 19th 2020.  \nDr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair\
  \ of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested\
  \ in the question of how humans evolved from \"being a relatively unremarkable primate\
  \ a few million years ago to the most successful species on the globe\", and how\
  \ culture affected our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret\
  \ of Our Success and The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically\
  \ Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Henrich\u2019\
  s new book, The WEIRDest People in the World. We first talk about innate anchors,\
  \ how societies evolved in complexity, the role that agriculture played, and the\
  \ various aspects of WEIRD psychology. We then get into the Catholic Church\u2019\
  s Marriage and Family Program of the Middle Ages, and the different aspects of sociality\
  \ that it influenced, including marriage, monogamy, urbanization, legal systems,\
  \ work ethics, and even science and the Enlightenment values. We also talk about\
  \ how we might evolve psychologically in the future, social engineering, and the\
  \ replication crisis in social psychology. Toward the end, we answer some questions\
  \ from a follower.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:42</time> Innate anchors  \n<time>06:00</time>\
