Her research contributes to the history of capitalism, exploring the critical relation between economic ideas and technocratic policy making. She is the author of The Capital Order: How Economists Invented Austerity and Paved the Way to Fascism.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Capital Order. We start by talking about how the relationship between the state and the market changed during World War I, and the empowerment of workers in its aftermath, illustrating it with the example of wage relations. We discuss workers movements and their goals, and the development of austerity in reaction to it. We talk about the real goals, and the economic and social consequences of austerity. We discuss if there is any “apolitical” theory in economics, and how austerity should be viewed as a response, not to economic crises, but to crises of capitalism. We also talk about the link between austerity and fascism, and finally we discuss if austerity can go away.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:35</time> The relationship between the state and the market during World War I  \n<time>03:13</time> The empowerment of workers in the aftermath of the war  \n<time>06:59</time> Wage relations  \n<time>11:28</time> The workers movements and their demands and goals  \n<time>17:26</time> The origins of austerity  \n<time>18:54</time> The real goals of austerity  \n<time>25:24</time> Is there really any “apolitical” theory in economics?  \n<time>30:08</time> Viewing austerity as a response, not to economic crises, but to crises of capitalism  \n<time>35:49</time> The link between austerity and fascism  \n<time>38:42</time> Can austerity go away?  \n<time>45:33</time> Follow Dr. Mattei’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Mattei’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3FY6drn  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3hP4eN3  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3W7TtUQ  \nThe Capital Order: https://bit.ly/3W6OoMD  \nTwitter handle: @claraemattei\n",
