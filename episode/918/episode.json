shownotes: "RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 3rd 2023.  \nDr. Antoine Marie is a Postdoctoral\
  \ Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark.\
  \ He is an evolutionary political psychologist with a background in philosophy,\
  \ sociology, political science, and social psychology. He conducts cross-cultural\
  \ psychology experiments and develops evolutionary theory to better understand,\

  \ strong moral convictions on controversial topics, typically in contexts of perceived\
  \ intergroup conflict.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about how people\
  \ evaluate political decisions. We then talk about the link between moral convictions\
  \ and the sharing of partisan news on social media, and the social functions of\
  \ holding and disseminating political conspiracy theories. We discuss how people\
  \ process and understand evidence of gender bias in hiring processes. Finally, we\
  \ talk about ideological orthodoxy, and the repression of free speech.\n\nTime Links:\
