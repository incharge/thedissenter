She is interested in humans as a social species. She investigates what infants, toddlers, and children think about social relationships (i.e., their naive sociology). She has studied how they think and feel about social hierarchy (i.e. situations where there is a 'winner' and a 'loser' or when someone is 'in charge.'). Currently, she is working with Elizabeth Spelke and Rebecca Saxe, and they are investigating how infants interpret social interactions that involve their own caregivers as well as how infants, toddlers, and children think about social intimacy. She has also studied people's moral judgments of parenting decisions.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about developmental psychology. We focus a lot on children’s naïve sociology, and how they think about social relationships. We get into issues surrounding social hierarchy, how children think about helpers and hinderers, winners and losers, and low and high-ranking individuals. We talk about the kinds of leaders children prefer. We discuss what children learn from social interactions involving their own caregivers, and how they think about social intimacy. Finally, we discuss the relation between people’s theories of intelligence and beliefs about brain development, and parenting.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> Naïve sociology, and how children think about social relationships  \n<time>09:23</time> How infants deal with helpers and hinderers  \n<time>11:01</time> How children evaluate others in terms of social hierarchy  \n<time>12:49</time> How human societies get structured  \n<time>18:29</time> How children think about winners and losers  \n<time>23:47</time> Leadership, and the kinds of leaders children prefer  \n<time>30:39</time> Low and high-ranking individuals  \n<time>34:15</time> Social interactions that involve caregivers  \n<time>39:39</time> Social intimacy  \n<time>45:05</time> Theories of intelligence, beliefs about brain development, and parenting  \n<time>53:21</time> Parenting in modern society  \n<time>57:53</time> Follow Dr. Thomas’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Thomas’ work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/3xAwjcV  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3cTQ6vZ  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/35IH6Gh  \nTwitter handle: @AshleyJ_Thomas\n",
