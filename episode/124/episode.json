  \ this episode, we start off by talking about the history and development of the\
  \ field of Behavioral Genetics. We also address the issue of environmentalism in\
  \ Psychology and the behavioral sciences. We also go through some of the basic concepts\
  \ in Behavioral Genetics, like heritability, gene-environment correlations, and\
  \ twin and adoptee studies. We also tackle the problems with environmental factors\
  \ in human behavior. We also deal with GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies), polygenic\
  \ scores and the type of information we can obtain from them and what we can do\
  \ with it. We also talk about how clinical psychology and psychiatry should revise\
  \ the way they classify mental conditions, moving from a qualitative to a quantitative\
  \ approach, and some of the current limitations in these fields. Toward the end,\
  \ we also briefly discuss the potential of gene editing technologies.\n\nTime Links:\
