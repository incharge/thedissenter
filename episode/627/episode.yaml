shownotes: "RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 15th 2022.  \nDr. Tanya Marie Luhrmann is the Albert\
  \ Ray Lang Professor in the Stanford Anthropology Department. She is a medical and\
  \ psychological anthropologist, and also an anthropologist of religion. More recently\
  \ she describes her work as an anthropology of mind. She was elected to the American\
  \ Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 and received a John Guggenheim Fellowship\
  \ award in 2007. Her books include When God Talks Back: Understanding the American\
  \ Evangelical Relationship with God, and the most recent one, How God Becomes Real:\
  \ Kindling the Presence of Invisible Others.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on How\
  \ God Becomes Real. We cover the main hypotheses put forth in the book: people don\u2019\
  t easily have faith in gods and spirits; detailed stories help to make gods and\
  \ spirits feel real; the way people think about their minds also matters; the sense\
  \ of response is \u201Ckindled\u201D; prayer practice changes the way people attend\
  \ to their thoughts; talent and training matter; and people create relationships\
  \ with gods and spirits. We also talk about the role of rituals and religious imagery,\
  \ the health benefits of religion, comparative phenomenology, an \u201Cattentional\
  \ learning\u201D theory of religion, and the New Atheists.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n\
