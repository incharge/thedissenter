  \ of Psychology at University of Ume\xE5, Sweden. Dr. Madison does research in Neuroscience,\
  \ Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about the psychology\
  \ of music, and several of the topics studied in this discipline. We talk about\
  \ the possible evolutionary bases of music, including the role of sexual selection.\
  \ We also discuss the genetic basis of musical ability, how it relates to personality\
  \ and IQ, how music might improve certain kinds of physical exercise, isochrony\
  \ and human rhythm, and how people develop their musical preferences.\n\nTime Links:\
