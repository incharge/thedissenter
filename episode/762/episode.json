His research goal is to understand how neurons develop selective responses to temporal features such as duration, interval and order. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's Flaws Shape our Lives, and Your Brain is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the neuroscience of timing. We start by discussing how to understand time from the perspective of neuroscience, and how the brain processes time. We talk about factors that influence our perception of time, when it comes to duration, interval, and order. We discuss the relationship between neural time and subjective time, how the brain encodes neural time in patterns of neural activity, and if there are brain regions specialized in time processing. We talk about the interaction between timing and the sensory systems, and timing as an intrinsic property of neural networks. We discuss the relationship between neural time and the physical nature of time. Finally, we talk about what a mental clock is.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> Time from the perspective of neuroscience  \n<time>05:35</time> How does the brain process time?  \n<time>09:00</time> Factors that influence our perception of time (duration and order)  \n<time>13:29</time> The relationship between neural time and subjective time  \n<time>15:27</time> How the brain encodes time in patterns of neural activity  \n<time>17:25</time> Brain regions specialized in time processing  \n<time>20:12</time> The interaction between timing and the sensory systems  \n<time>23:29</time> Memory  \n<time>28:10</time> Is timing an intrinsic property of neural networks?  \n<time>29:52</time> The relationship between neural time and the physical nature of time  \n<time>37:30</time> Is there a mental clock?  \n<time>39:36</time> Follow Dr. Buonomano’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Buonomano’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3QQoKsy  \nBuonomano Lab: https://bit.ly/3Qvku1N  \nWorks on ResearchGate: https://bit.ly/3dBdYaX  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/3EvO9F0  \nYour Brain is a Time Machine: https://bit.ly/3BvEj3k\n",
