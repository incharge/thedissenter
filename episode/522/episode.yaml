  \ of Psychology at Oklahoma State University. Dr. Krems is a social psychologist\
  \ with interdisciplinary training. Her research draws on theoretical perspectives\
  \ from social psychology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology and anthropology,\
  \ as well as animal behavior to investigate how people use cues to strategically\
  \ navigate their social worlds and meet their social goals. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about female friendships, stereotypes and prejudice, and religion and\
  \ monogamy. We first get into the evolution of female sociality, and how female\
  \ establish friendships among themselves. We talk about aggression in friendships,\
  \ and social factors that influence levels of aggression, like economic inequality\
  \ and sex ratios. We discuss the evolutionary bases of stereotypes and prejudice,\
  \ with a focus on the stereotypes people hold about women who have casual sex. Finally,\
  \ we talk about the relationship between preferred mating strategies and religiosity,\
  \ and anti-atheist prejudice.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:41</time>\
