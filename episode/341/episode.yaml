  \nIn this episode, we focus on Dr. Kaufman\u2019s new book, Transcend. We talk about\
  \ Mallow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, and how it has been misinterpreted over the\
  \ years. We refer to transcendence, self-actualization, and humanistic and positive\
  \ psychology. We refer to how evolutionary psychology has neglected the study of\
  \ transcendence, and other related topics. We go through different individual differences\
  \ and how they influence how people approach these needs, including personality\
  \ differences, differences in IQ and intelligence, and attachment styles. We also\
  \ mention the dark and light triads of human personality. Finally, we talk about\
  \ purpose, and humanity\u2019s potential.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:25</time> Maslow\u2019\
