Broadly, she tries to understand how evolution shaped our preferences, and what its consequences are in our contemporary lives. Her work has covered various topics such as parent-offspring conflict over mate choice, variation in feminine beauty standards through history, sexual selection on age at menopause, and mate preferences for homogamy in facial features. \n\nIn this episode, we talk about female attractiveness, and parent-offspring conflict over mate choice. We first talk about the evolutionary rationale behind female attractiveness, and what men evolved to find most attractive in women. We get specifically into the waist-to-hip ratio, and facial attractiveness. We discuss variation in female attractiveness across time and cultures. Finally, we talk about parent-offspring conflict over mate choice.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:40</time> The evolution of female attractiveness  \n<time>04:53</time> What men find most attractive  \n<time>09:19</time> The waist-to-hip ratio  \n<time>17:39</time> Facial attractiveness  \n<time>31:28</time> Variation in female attractiveness across time and cultures  \n<time>38:35</time> Parent-offspring conflict over mate choice  \n<time>48:50</time> Follow Dr. Bovet’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Bovet’s work:  \nUniversity page: https://bit.ly/382bJdY  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3M6KoX0\n",
