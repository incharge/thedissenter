excerpt: Dr. Wiebke Bleidorn is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich.
  Dr. Bleidorn examines the conditions, mechanisms, and consequences of personality
  change. Personality change is an emerging subfield that straddles the areas of personality,
  developmental, and social psychology. Dr. Bleidorn's work sits at this intersection.
  Her current research involves questions about the cultural and social conditions
  under which people change, the genetic and environmental mechanisms that account
  for change, and the consequences of these changes for psychological functioning
  and important life outcomes.

  \ of Psychology at the University of Zurich. Dr. Bleidorn examines the conditions,\
  \ mechanisms, and consequences of personality change. Personality change is an emerging\
  \ subfield that straddles the areas of personality, developmental, and social psychology.\
  \ Dr. Bleidorn's work sits at this intersection. Her current research involves questions\
  \ about the cultural and social conditions under which people change, the genetic\
  \ and environmental mechanisms that account for change, and the consequences of\
  \ these changes for psychological functioning and important life outcomes.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we talk about personality changes. We first contextualize the conversation,\
  \ by talking about the Big Five personality traits and their structure. We talk\
  \ about the heritability of these traits, and how they are influenced by the environment.\
  \ We get into personality plasticity, and go through individual differences in it;\
  \ patterns in personality changes across the lifespan; the transition to adulthood,\
  \ and the transition to parenthood; and the impact of life events. Finally, we discuss\
  \ if people can deliberately change their personality.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
