shownotes: "Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology\
  \ at Oakland University, as well as the Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ Lab there. He is the editor in chief of the academic journals Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ and Evolutionary Psychological Science. He is a fellow of the American Psychological\
  \ Association and the Association for Psychological Science.  \nDr. Viviana Weekes-Shackelford\
  \ received her Ph.D. in evolutionary developmental psychology in 2011 from Florida\
  \ Atlantic University. She is currently Visiting Assistant Professor in Sociology\
  \ and Criminal Justice at Oakland University and Co-Director of the Evolutionary\
  \ Psychology Lab. Her research over the years has been evolutionarily inspired and\
  \ has had the broader goal of gaining a more comprehensive understanding of violence\
  \ and conflict in families and romantic relationships. Her research interests and\
  \ record cut across the psychological domains of forensics, development, social,\
  \ personality, clinical, and criminology.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about what\
  \ happens in people\u2019s mating lives after they have children. We talk about\
  \ the trade-offs people need to make between mating and parenting. We refer to how\
  \ children might get exposed to more violence from stepparents, and how women don\u2019\
  t necessarily need men to raise children adequately. We also discuss how men tend\
  \ to be more violent, even toward their own children, and the issue of differential\
  \ investment by paternal and maternal grandparents. We then go into the ways having\
  \ children might affect their parents\u2019 romantic relationship, and how there\
  \ are different outcomes for different couples. We also talk about the several ways\
  \ single parents (both men and women) might see their mate value decrease. Toward\
  \ the end we also speculate a bit, and discuss why children probably don\u2019t\
  \ interfere with their parents having more children, and why witnessing their parents\
  \ having sex and seeing naked people probably does not have a negative impact on\
  \ children.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:36</time> Mating after having children  \n\
