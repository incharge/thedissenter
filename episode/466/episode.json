He is a founding member of the Economic Science Institute and founding member and Director of the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy. His research uses experimental economics to explore the foundations of exchange and specialization and the origins of property. Another of his research programs compares decision making in humans, apes, and monkeys. In 2019 he co-authored with Vernon Smith a Cambridge University Press book entitled, \"Humanomics: Moral Sentiments and the Wealth of Nations for the Twenty-First Century.\" He is the author of The Property Species: Mine, Yours, and the Human Mind.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Property Species, and talk about Dr. Wilson’s work on this subject more broadly. We first discuss property from an evolutionary perspective, and the endowment effect. We ask if property is a human universal. We then talk about sharing, exchange, trade, and specialization. We discuss some features of the human mind that play a role in how we think about property, like abstract thinking, language, and morality. Dr. Wilson explains the difference between property and property rights. We also talk about intellectual property, and what we can learn about human sociality (focusing on how people cooperate) by studying how people think about property. Finally, we ask if anarchy could ever work, why social preferences are not preferences, and some thoughts on the so-called “sharing economy”.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:57</time> Property from an evolutionary perspective  \n<time>07:28</time> The endowment effect  \n<time>14:41</time> Property across cultures  \n<time>16:59</time> Sharing  \n<time>18:57</time> Language and morality  \n<time>25:35</time> Exchange and specialization  \n<time>34:43</time> The difference between property and property rights  \n<time>38:51</time> Intellectual property  \n<time>43:54</time> Property and human cooperation  \n<time>46:41</time> Would anarchy ever work?  \n<time>49:03</time> Social preferences are not preferences  \n<time>53:27</time> The sharing economy  \n<time>54:54</time> Follow Dr. Wilson’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Wilson’s work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/2Wwxyts  \nGoogle Scholar profile: https://bit.ly/3jwiRBb  \nAmazon page: https://amzn.to/2OgVrEh  \nThe Property Species: https://amzn.to/2YX4mN9  \nTwitter handle: @bartwilson\n",
