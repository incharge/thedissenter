  \ BEEN SOME SORT OF RECORDING ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING.\n\nDr. Frederick\
  \ Crews is an American essayist and literary critic, and Professor Emeritus of English\
  \ at the University of California, Berkeley. Also, a prominent participant in the\
  \ \"Freud wars\" of the 1980s and 1990s, a debate over the reputation, scholarship\
  \ and impact on the 20th century of the founder of psychoanalysis, Freud. He\u2019\
  s the author of many books, including the ones that are relevant to our conversation\
  \ today, The Memory Wars: Freud\u2019s Legacy in Dispute, and Freud: The Making\
  \ of an Illusion.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how and why Dr. Crews decided\
  \ to turn against Freud\u2019s psychological theories, and his role against the\
  \ Recovered Memory Therapy movement in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, and the idea\
  \ of repressed memories. We then move on to talk about Freud\u2019s personality,\
  \ and what led him to adopt a pseudoscientific academic approach. We cover some\
  \ of his medical work and his main theories, like hysteria, the Oedipus Complex,\
  \ dream analysis, and his organization of the unconscious. Finally, we discuss psychoanalysis\
  \ in general, and if it is today something resembling a science at least. \n\nTime\
