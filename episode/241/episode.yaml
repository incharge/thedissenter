  \ that advent of sex robots might have on human (romantic) relationships. Dr. Brandon\u2019\
  s first presents a summary of her view on the issue, and how it would affect men\
  \ more than women. We talk about the issue about speculating about new technologies,\
  \ and how people usually get things wrong. Then, we discuss the potential advantages\
  \ and disadvantages of sex robots, and also how men and women would be differentially\
  \ impacted by them, due to their differences in sexual strategies and mating.\n\n\
