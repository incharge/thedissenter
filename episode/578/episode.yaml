shownotes: "RECORDED ON OCTOBER 7th 2021.  \nDr. Drew Bailey is Associate Professor\
  \ in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine. His research\
  \ interests include mathematical development, individual differences, and longitudinal\
  \ methods.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about individual differences in educational\
  \ attainment, educational interventions, and sex differences in cognitive abilities.\
  \ We start by discussing what to think about the finding in behavioral genetics\
  \ when it comes to educational attainment. We talk about educational interventions,\
  \ what works and what does not, and how their effects fade out. We discuss if education\
  \ systems should be reformed, and what are some of the biggest challenges there\
  \ and how to deal with them. Finally, we discuss sex differences in education, educational\
  \ choices, and educational attainment; we talk about the gender equality paradox\
  \ and how it is interpreted and explained; and sex differences in cognitive abilities\
  \ \u2013 verbal, spatial, and mathematical -, and how impactful they are in education.\n\
