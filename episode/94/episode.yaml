  \ episode, we talk about what game theory is, and how it works; conflict between\
  \ the mother and the fetus in the womb; walk away vs the traditional tit-for-tat\
  \ cooperative strategies; the osotua system of the Masai, a need-based cooperative\
  \ system; principles that rule interactions from the cellular to the societal levels,\
  \ and how they can be applied to develop better tools to fight cancer.\n\nTime Links:\
