Thurnau Professor at the University of Michigan. Dr. Anderson specializes in moral, social and political philosophy, feminist theory, social epistemology, and the philosophy of economics and the social sciences. Her latest book is Hijacked: How Neoliberalism Turned the Work Ethic against Workers and How Workers Can Take It Back.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on Hijacked. We start by talking about the origins of the protestant work ethic, the relationship between the work ethic and utilitarianism, and the ideas of John Locke. We discuss how conservatives hijacked the concept of the work ethic and turned it against the workers, and the earlier political applications of the conservative work ethic, involving English welfare reform, the Irish poor law, etc. We talk about Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and the progressive work ethic. We discuss social democracy and the origins of social insurance. We talk about the rise of neoliberalism, and how welfare policy, and business ethics operate in neoliberal capitalism. Finally, we discuss how we can strive for a progressive work ethic.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> The origins of the protestant work ethic  \n<time>05:50</time> The relationship between the work ethic and utilitarianism  \n<time>12:06</time> The ideas of John Locke  \n<time>15:40</time> How conservatives hijacked the concept of the work ethic and turning it against the workers  \n<time>29:12</time> The political applications of the conservative work ethic: English welfare reform, the Irish poor law, etc.  \n<time>37:40</time> Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and the progressive work ethic  \n<time>50:37</time> Social democracy and social insurance  \n<time>56:30</time> The rise of neoliberalism  \n<time>1:00:33</time> Welfare policy, and business ethics in neoliberal capitalism  \n<time>1:08:19</time> Striving for a progressive work ethic  \n<time>1:12:32</time> Follow Dr. Anderson’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Anderson’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/46mPuZd  \nHijacked: https://bit.ly/461n5rL\n",
