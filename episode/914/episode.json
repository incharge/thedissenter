He is a biological anthropologist with a general interest in understanding the evolution and maintenance of social systems. His main research interest is to examine the mechanisms that maintain pair-living, sexual monogamy and biparental care and the role that sexual selection may have had in the evolution of them. He is also motivated to study living primates as an approach to understanding the evolution of human behavior. He is particularly interested in male-female relationships, pair bonding and paternal care in humans and non-human primates.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about mating systems in primates, social and genetic monogamy, and pair-living and pair bonding. We also discuss the evolution of biparental care, the role that sexual selection plays in its evolution, and cooperative breeding in primate species. Finally, we talk about natal dispersal in monogamous owl monkeys. \n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:51</time> Mating systems in primates  \n<time>08:15</time> Social and genetic monogamy  \n<time>13:31</time> Pair-living and pair bonding  \n<time>19:26</time> The evolution of biparental care  \n<time>26:15</time> The role of sexual selection  \n<time>30:08</time> Cooperative breeding in primate species  \n<time>39:59</time> Natal dispersal in monogamous owl monkeys  \n<time>48:12</time> Follow Dr. Fernandez-Duque’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Fernandez-Duque’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3NE24gj  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3JnH9LE  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3E3VtWO\n",
