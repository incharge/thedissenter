  \ Research Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Georgia. His research\
  \ has made significant contributions to several areas in the field of Social Psychology.\
  \ He created the self-evaluation maintenance model, a theory in social psychology\

  \ about the self-evaluation maintenance model. We refer to how it helps us better\
  \ understand how people navigate their personal relationships, and how they compare\
  \ themselves to others. We also discuss things like the \u201Cself\u201D, self-esteem,\
  \ and personal growth. Toward the end, Dr. Tesser also speculates a bit on how self-evaluation\
  \ might have evolved in our species.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:43</time> The self-evaluation\
