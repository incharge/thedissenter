  \ of Ancient History at Universit\xE9 Rennes 2. He is a classics scholar who specializes\
  \ in Greek antiquity, the historical anthropology of sport, and the history of social\
  \ inequalities. He is the author of The Dangerous Life and Ideas of Diogenes the\
  \ Cynic.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on The Dangerous Life and Ideas of Diogenes\
  \ the Cynic. We start by talking about the Mediterranean world of the 4th century\
  \ BCE, and the life of Diogenes. We then go through his philosophy, and topics like\
  \ cosmopolitanism, cultural relativism, and questioning norms; the fact of poverty\
  \ and the feeling of poverty; being a mendicant philosopher; his jar as a symbol;\
  \ slavery and freedom; pleasure, diet, and sex; exercise and health; speaking one\u2019\
  s mind freely; his supposed encounter with Alexander the Great; his ideas about\
  \ Socrates and Plato; and his death. Finally, we discuss which philosophers were\
  \ influenced by Diogenes, Stoicism, and his legacy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
