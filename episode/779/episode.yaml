shownotes: "RECORDED ON JANUARY 17th 2023.  \nDr. Keelah Williams is an Assistant\
  \ Professor of Psychology and Director of Jurisprudence of Law and Justice Studies\
  \ at Hamilton College. Her current research explores how the perception of threats\
  \ and opportunities in the environment may shape stereotype content, punishment\
  \ strategies, and legal decision-making. Her work has been published in journals\
  \ such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn this episode, we\
  \ talk about stereotypes, criminal justice, and friendships. We discuss what stereotypes\
  \ are, where they stem from, their different types, ecology-driven stereotypes,\
  \ their connection to prejudice, and their social functions. We talk a bit about\
  \ emotions from an evolutionary perspective, and how they apply to mediation contexts.\
  \ We discuss how people develop perceptions of criminal behavior, and when and why\
  \ they endorse the death penalty. Finally, we talk about friendships, who we want\
  \ as friends, and friendship jealousy.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
