shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 11th 2022.  \nDr. Christopher Krupenye is an assistant\
  \ professor in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins\
  \ University. Dr. Krupenye is interested in the cognitive abilities of humans and\
  \ other species, especially those involved in navigating the social world.\n\nIn\
  \ this episode, we talk about aspects of primate sociality. We start with theory\
  \ of mind, and discuss if it is a unitary capacity, and how to study it in nonhuman\
  \ primates. We ask if other primates have theory of mind, and talk about studying\
  \ self and self-awareness. We also get into understanding false beliefs, sharing\
  \ behavior, prosociality, and a preference for helpers or hinderers.\n\nTime Links:\
