shownotes: "Dr. Heather Montgomery is a social anthropologist who studied for her\
  \ PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, which she wrote on child prostitution in Thailand.\
  \ She has had jobs and research positions in Sussex, Norway, Texas and at Oxford.\
  \ Her research interests are within Childhood Studies, especially the history and\
  \ anthropology of childhood and children\u2019s rights.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about what might be some cultural influences on childhood, and how boys and girls\
  \ behave. We address the issue about how parents might look at their children as\
  \ economic assets, and how that influences division of labor between the sexes,\
  \ and child labor. We finish by talking a little bit about how people\u2019s perceptions\
  \ about children changed over time in the West, and some of the reason behind that\
  \ change.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:45</time> Do children share traits across different\
