She’s the author of Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the approach developed by Dr. Cecilia Heyes and collaborators, as exposed in her book, Cognitive Gadgets – cultural evolutionary psychology. First, we discuss what it borrows from Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Evolutionary Theory, and what assumptions from both of those fields it rejects. We talk about modularity of mind, and then get into two of the cognitive mechanisms that Dr. Heyes explores in the book, namely imitation and mindreading (or theory of mind). We get a bit into how language might influence our thinking. And toward the end we address issues regarding human nature, and evolutionary mismatch.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>01:12</time> The strengths and weaknesses of Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Evolutionary Theory, and the new field of cultural evolutionary psychology (cognitive gadgets theory)  \n<time>11:10</time> On modularity of mind  \n<time>23:03</time> To what extent would culture be deterministic?                                   \n<time>28:03</time> The development of imitation  \n<time>38:04</time> Criteria to classify a mental mechanism as innate  \n<time>44:41</time> Is mindreading universal?  \n<time>50:17</time> Does language influence the way we think?  \n<time>53:34</time> Can culture influence how we experience and think about emotions?  \n<time>1:01:40</time> Gene-culture coevolution  \n<time>1:05:09</time> A novel view on human nature  \n<time>1:09:37</time> About evolutionary mismatch  \n<time>1:13:06</time> Would cultural evolutionary psychology apply to all sorts of mental mechanisms?  \n<time>1:16:11</time> Follow Dr. Heyes’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Heyes’ work:  \nFaculty page/website: https://bit.ly/2H1BZVZ  \nResearchgate profile: https://bit.ly/2XiI4Xj  \nCognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking: https://amzn.to/2Jem1cI  \nTwitter handle: @CeliaHeyes\n",
