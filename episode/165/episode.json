shownotes: "Dr. Stephen Law is formally Reader in Philosophy at Heythrop College,\
  \ and before that Research Fellow at The Queen\u2019s College Oxford. He is currently\
  \ editor of the Royal Institute of Philosophy journal THINK. He has published several\
  \ books, including The Philosophy Gym, A Very Short Introduction to Humanism, and\
  \ Believing Bullshit. He is a Fellow of The Royal Society of Arts and Commerce and\
  \ in 2008 became the provost of the Centre for Inquiry UK. \n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we start off by talking about the limitations of naturalism in terms of knowledge\
  \ acquisition, the is-ought problem, and the flaws of relativism. Then, we move\
  \ on to discussing Liberalism, as is presented by Stephen Law in his book, The War\
  \ for Children\u2019s Minds, and the important distinction between freedom of thought\
  \ and freedom of action. We also deal with the issue of religion in a scientific\
  \ world and the approach of the New Atheists. We question the idea that the West\
  \ is going through some sort of \u201Cmoral crisis\u201D, and the bad outcomes that\
  \ pushing for that narrative might have. And, finally, we address the flaws in arguments\
  \ between religious people and atheist when it comes to the problem of evil and\
  \ the Evil-God challenge.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:54</time> The limitations of\
