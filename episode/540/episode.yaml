shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 20th 2021.  \nDr. Itai Yanai is Founding Director of\
  \ the Institute for Computational Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.\
  \ He is also a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology\
  \ at NYU. He does research on cancer, computational biology, developmental genetics,\
  \ genomics, microbiome, systems biology, single-cell transcriptomics, gene expression\
  \ atlas construction, genome evolution. He is the author of The Society of Genes.\n\
  \nIn this episode, we focus on The Society of Genes. We first talk about the metaphor\
  \ of the \u201Cselfish gene\u201D. We ask if mutations really occur randomly. We\
  \ get into the idea of \u201Cthe society of genes\u201D, and discuss how genes cooperate\
  \ and compete with one another. We discuss pleiotropy and polygenic traits, and\
  \ what they tell us about how genes work. We talk about the evolution of sex, and\
  \ what we can learn about genetics by studying cancer. We discuss human genetic\
  \ diversity, and how to deal with genetic ancestry in medicine. Finally, we talk\
  \ about epigenetics, gene editing, and some unanswered questions in genetics.\n\n\
