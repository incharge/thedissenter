shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 18th 2023.  \nDr. Cailin O\u2019Connor is Professor in\
  \ the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at UC Irvine. She is a philosopher\
  \ of biology and behavioral sciences, philosopher of science, and evolutionary game\
  \ theorist. Her monograph The Origins of Unfairness was published in July 2019 by\
  \ Oxford University Press. She is the author of Games in the Philosophy of Biology,\
  \ and The Misinformation Age.\n\nIn this episode, we start by talking about game\
  \ theory, and what we can study through it. We then talk about social pressure,\
  \ conformity, conservativism, and selection in science. We discuss if scientific\
  \ retraction works. We talk about perpetual categories, and if they have evolved\
  \ to track properties of the world. We discuss learning generalization, and evolutionarily\
  \ stable strategies. Finally, we talk about misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\
