His research interests include applied anthropology, organizational and institutional cultures, evolutionary theory and cultural patterning, and popular culture and identity.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about the evolution of altruism. We start by talking about the most prominent evolutionary theories of human cooperation. We discuss how we can study intentional communities as a source of data about the evolution of cooperation. We get into altruistic punishment, kinship, fictive kinship, kin recognition, kin cues, and how they relate to the success of institutions. We discuss explanations for extreme altruism, like religious celibacy. Finally, we talk about the problem of cultural particularism in anthropology.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:31</time> Evolutionary theories of human cooperation  \n<time>10:16</time> Intentional communities as a source of data about the evolution of human cooperation  \n<time>18:07</time> Altruistic punishment  \n<time>20:35</time> Kinship, fictive kinship, and kin cues  \n<time>29:31</time> Kin recognition and institutional success  \n<time>36:30</time> Explaining extreme altruism – religious celibacy, self-sacrifice  \n<time>43:23</time> The problem of cultural particularism in anthropology  \n<time>49:08</time> Follow Dr. Qirko’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Qirko’s work:  \nFaculty page: https://bit.ly/3InS6KM  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/33TRKN7\n",
