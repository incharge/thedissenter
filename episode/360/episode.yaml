shownotes: "RECORDED ON JULY 31st, 2020.  \nDr. Bo Winegard generally approaches psychological\
  \ puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory of natural\
  \ selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences, individual\
  \ differences, bias, methods, and political psychology. He\u2019s also the cohost,\
  \ together with Cory Clark, of the Psyphilopod podcast.\n\nIn this episode, we talk\
  \ about the vices and defects of intellectuals and intellectual life, and also about\
  \ social conservatism, by going through some of Bo\u2019s tweets.\n\nTime Links:\
  \  \n<time>00:32</time> \u201CDon\u2019t trust intellectuals when they are the last\
  \ people who actually experience the consequences of their own ideas\u201D  \n<time>05:46</time>\
  \ \u201COne reason the intellectual elite are sometimes so loud and histrionic is\
  \ because they no longer have control over all conduit.\u201D  \n<time>14:13</time>\
  \ \u201CIntellectuals are really good at catastrophizing. They believe that things\
  \ matter much more than they actually do. And then they try to save the world from\
  \ various imminent dangers. It happens on both the right and the left. The boring\
  \ truth is, things aren\u2019t that bad.\u201D  \n<time>18:16</time> \u201CIntellectuals\
  \ often claim (from Socrates forward) that \u201Cthe unexamined life isn\u2019t\
  \ worth living\u201D. But that is completely untrue. I imagine that a Life spent\
  \ with family, friends and community is worth living, even without self-reflection.\u201D\
  \  \n<time>25:22</time> \u201CThe great mistake that intellectuals make is that\
  \ knowledge must be articulable. Most knowledge is intuitive. And most articulation\
  \ is erroneous.\u201D  \n<time>32:36</time> \u201CSocial conservatism is so unpopular\
  \ among intellectuals because it contends that the intellect is not particularly\
  \ helpful for designing social policy. Try selling anti-athleticism to the NBA\u201D\
