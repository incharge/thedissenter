  \ Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University. In addition\

  \ Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, a visiting professor\

  t), and an associate editor of the journal Philosophy of Science. With Paul Raeburn,\
  \ he is the author of The Game Theorist's Guide to Parenting.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about game theory applied to biological phenomena and social dynamics.\
  \ We go through several topics, including evolutionary stable strategies; signaling\
  \ theory; honest communication and language; behavioral plasticity, and the evolution\
  \ of culture; social norms; and epistemic communities, and how to improve science\
  \ production.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:48</time> Game theory, evolution, and social\
