Fascinated by apparently irrational beliefs and behaviors, he works with Hugo Mercier on the role of epistemic reputation in communication and the cognitive mechanisms underlying information transmission and evaluation.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about fake news, and scientific misinformation. We start with fake news, and discuss how widespread it really is, and the sort of cultural and social factors behind fake news sharing. We talk about misinformation on misinformation, and moral panics about fake news. We also talk about scientific misinformation during the COVID pandemic, and how governments and health authorities could have done a better job of communicating COVID-related information. We finish with a discussion of what would make for more effective science communication.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:36</time> Fake news  \n<time>04:53</time> Why do people share fake news?  \n<time>12:04</time> Social media is for fostering social relations  \n<time>20:16</time> Does fake news change people’s behavior?  \n<time>27:15</time> Misinformation on misinformation  \n<time>33:42</time> Scientific misinformation  \n<time>37:35</time> Misinformation in the COVID pandemic, and vaccine hesitancy  \n<time>45:48</time> Better ways of doing science communication  \n<time>55:41</time> Follow Sacha’s work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Sacha’s work:  \nWebsite: https://bit.ly/2P0PYSv  \nResearchGate profile: https://bit.ly/3ok96IJ  \nTwitter handle: @Sacha_Altay\n",
