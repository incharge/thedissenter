Her research focuses broadly on social influence and the psychology of compliance and consent. She is the author of You Have More Influence Than You Think: How We Underestimate Our Power of Persuasion, and Why It Matters.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on You Have More Influence Than You Think. We discuss how much we impact other people, and go through topics like compliments; expressing gratitude; the invisibility cloak illusion, and the spotlight effect; what people really pay attention to; audience tuning, and the “saying-is-believing effect”; behavioral contagion; first impressions; assertiveness; the domains where people think they are below-average; how people react to requests; why it’s hard to say “no”; why people in positions of power underestimate the negative impact they have on others; and other topics. We talk about ways by which we can become more aware and mindful of our influence on others. Finally, we discuss if influencers and gurus are preying on our insecurities to sell their products.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro  \n<time>00:37</time> How is the impact we have on other people studied?  \n<time>01:49</time> Do people like compliments?  \n<time>07:28</time> Expressing gratitude  \n<time>09:13</time> The invisibility cloak illusion, and the spotlight effect  \n<time>13:39</time> What do people really pay attention to?  \n<time>15:17</time> What happens when we share experiences with other people  \n<time>17:29</time> When we say what other people want to hear - audience tuning, and the “saying-is-believing” effect  \n<time>22:47</time> Behavioral contagion  \n<time>26:11</time> Do we usually leave negative impressions on other people?  \n<time>30:00</time> Being assertive  \n<time>31:35</time> When people think they are below-average  \n<time>35:17</time> How do people react to requests?  \n<time>41:03</time> Why it’s hard to say no, and the MeToo movement  \n<time>46:27</time> Why people in positions of power underestimate the negative impact they have on others  \n<time>50:15</time> Questions that should not be asked in job interviews  \n<time>54:58</time> Can we become more aware and mindful of our influence on others?  \n<time>57:14</time> Are influencers and gurus preying on our insecurities to sell their products?  \n<time>1:01:26</time> Follow Dr. Bohns’ work!\n\n---\n\nFollow Dr. Bohns’ work:  \nFaculty page: http://bit.ly/4004Dwp  \nWebsite: http://bit.ly/3ZCCGev  \nYou Have More Influence Than You Think: https://bit.ly/3JctO82  \nTwitter handle: @profbohns\n",
