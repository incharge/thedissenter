excerpt: Dr. Manvir Singh is Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Advanced
  Study in Toulouse.  His research program aims to explain why societies develop complex,
  recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property rights,
  sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared in all
  types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands to complex,
  industrial, mega-urbanized states.

shownotes: "Dr. Manvir Singh is Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Advanced\
  \ Study in Toulouse.  His research program aims to explain why societies develop\
  \ complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property\
  \ rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared\
  \ in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands\
  \ to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ a recent paper of his, \u201CHuman social organization during the Late Pleistocene:\
  \ Beyond the nomadic-egalitarian model\u201D. We break down the nomadic-egalitarian\
  \ hunter-gatherer model. Dr. Singh presents his diverse histories model, and we\
  \ discuss the implications it has for our evolved psychology, and how we think about\
  \ evolutionary mismatches. We discuss how human societies get organized, the origins\
  \ of agriculture, the transition to large-scale agricultural societies, and non-agricultural\
  \ state societies. We also talk about the sympathetic plot in fiction, and its psychological\
  \ origins. Finally, we discuss how to think about the functionality of beliefs.\n\
