  Dr. Lisa Welling is a tenured Associate Professor at Oakland University, US, and\
  \ head of The Welling Research Lab there. She was awarded the Oakland University\
  \ New Investigator Research Excellence Award in 2015, and the Oakland University\
  \ Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award in 2018. She currently serves on the Editorial\
  \ Boards for the journals Evolutionary Psychological Science, Evolutionary Psychology,\
  \ and Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology. She is particularly interested in\
  \ how hormones affect different aspects of our behavior, including mate choice,\
  \ preferences, and sexual behavior.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about behavioral\
  \ endocrinology (the way hormones affect our behavior), and evolutionary psychology.\
  \ We start by going through some basic concepts about endocrinology. Then we go\
  \ through some differences between men and women in sexual and mating behavior.\
  \ We finish up with a discussion about how to integrate Evolutionary Psychology\
  \ and Social Psychology, and also the importance of the former in today\u2019s context.\n\
