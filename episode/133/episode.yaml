  \ Naturalized and Philosophy of Economics.  \n\nIn this episode, we first tackle\
  \ the issue of the epistemological value of naturalism and the scientific method,\
  \ and the role of philosophy in the modern world. Then, we talk about economics;\
  \ the economic agent; rationality; the interplay between economics, psychology,\
  \ and sociology; picoeconomics; and the neuroeconomics and picoeconomics of addictive\
  \ behavior. We finish off by talking about how models of reality are always incomplete\
  \ and limited, and about the conflict between reductionism and emergentism.\n\n\
