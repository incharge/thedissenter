  \ in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College in Schenectady, NY,\
  \ where he teaches a wide range of classes, and does research on atomic, molecular,\
  \ and optical physics. He writes a blog about physics for Forbes.com. He is the\
  \ author of several books, including Eureka: Discovering Your Inner Scientist, and\
  \ Breakfast with Einstein: The Exotic Physics of Everyday Objects. His latest book\
  \ is A Brief History of Timekeeping: The Science of Marking Time, from Stonehenge\
  \ to Atomic Clocks.\n\nIn this episode, we focus on A Brief History of Timekeeping.\
  \ Topics include: timekeeping as a human universal; what a clock is; using the \u201C\
  movements\u201D of the Sun; using other stars and the moon; how the cycle of the\
  \ zodiac got invented; how different calendars got created; the influence of politics\
  \ and religion on timekeeping; the first clocks; how mechanical clocks work; how\
  \ global empires and astronomy influenced the evolution of clocks; the development\
  \ of standardized time zones; the ways by which the physical nature of time differ\
  \ from the human understanding of it; quantum clocks and their applications; and\
  \ potential new clocks in the future.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time> Intro\
