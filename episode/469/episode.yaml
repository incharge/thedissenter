  \ at New York University. Her has interests primarily focused in the foundations\
  \ of physics, metaphysics, and logic. His books include Quantum Non-Locality and\
  \ Relativity, Truth and Paradox and The Metaphysics Within Physics. He is a member\
  \ of the Academie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences and the Foundational\
  \ Questions Institute (FQXi). He has been a Guggenheim Fellow.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the philosophy of physics and metaphysics. We start by presenting\
  \ some of the questions asked in philosophy of physics. We then discuss quantum\
  \ mechanics and string theory. We talk about the nature of time, and ask if time\
  \ travel will ever be possible and if it even makes sense theoretically. Finally,\
  \ we address the relationship between Physics and Metaphysics, and we discuss if\
  \ philosophy has been making any progress.\n\nTime Links:  \n<time>00:00</time>\
