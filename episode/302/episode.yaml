  \ Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  His primary training\
  \ is in biological anthropology and genetics. In 2006 he was elected a Fellow of\
  \ the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  In 2012 he was awarded\

  \ The Alternative Introduction to Biological Anthropology, Tales of the Ex-Apes:\
  \ How We Think about Human Evolution, and Is Science Racist?.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we talk about the ways we think about human evolutionary story as an origins story.\
  \ We refer to the differences between a popular origin story and a scientific one.\
  \ We address hominin species classification, and the concepts of ancestry and kinship.\
  \ We discuss if \u201Crace\u201D is a scientifically accurate term, and also the\
  \ influence of biology and culture in human behavior, passing through the notion\
  \ of \u201Chuman universal\u201D. Finally, we discuss if science is inevitably a\
  \ value-laden enterprise, and the myths behind its history.\n\n\n\nTime Links: \
