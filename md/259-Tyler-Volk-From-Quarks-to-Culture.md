I’M SORRY ABOUT THE MISSING BITS OF AUDIO HERE AND THERE, BUT THE CONNECTION WAS A BIT WEAK.  
Dr. Tyler Volk is Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies at New York University. His areas of interest include principles of form and function in systems (described as metapatterns), environmental challenges to global prosperity, CO2 and global change, biosphere theory and the role of life in earth dynamics. Dr. Volk has authored seven books, most recently, Quarks to Culture: How We Came to Be. His previous books include: CO2 Rising: The World’s Greatest Environmental Challenge, What is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life, Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth, and Metapatterns: Across Space, Time, and Mind.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Volk’s book, Quarks to Culture. We talk about the fundamental levels, from fundamental quanta to geopolitical states, and the three dynamical realms of physical laws, biological evolution, and cultural evolution. We also refer to the concepts of combogenesis and the alphakit, to understand how we move from one level to the next. Toward the end, we also discuss how we might be able to move beyond the level of geopolitical states.
