Dr. Cory Clark is an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Social Psychology at Durham University, UK. Dr. Clark does research in Moral Psychology, Political Psychology, Experimental Philosophy, and Motivated Cognition. She’s also the cohost of Psyphilopod.

In this episode, we focus on experimental philosophy, moral judgment, beliefs in free will and determinism, and political bias. We first talk about the new field of experimental philosophy, and how it differs from how philosophy was traditionally done. We then get into some specific topics like people’s belief in free will and their need to attribute moral responsibility, and how they deal with a deterministic view of the world that comes from science. Also, how people judge themselves and others differently, or the fundamental attribution error. And how liberals and conservatives think about free will, determinism and compatibilism. We then move on to discuss biases, starting off with what is the best way to think about them; in what ways political biases are special; and the impact they have on science. Finally, we got through what we know about how liberals and conservatives deal with different viewpoints and ideas, and several hypotheses to explain where that comes from.
