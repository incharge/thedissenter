Dr. Todd Shackelford is a Distinguished Professor and Chair of Psychology at Oakland University, as well as the Co-Director of the Evolutionary Psychology Lab there. He is the editor in chief of the academic journals Evolutionary Psychology and Evolutionary Psychological Science. He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and the Association for Psychological Science.

In this episode, we focus on The SAGE Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology. We first get into what evolutionary psychology is, and a bit of its history and theoretical bases. We then go through sex differences (and how they derive from sexual selection and intrasexual competition), parental investment, life history theory, attachment theory, Tinbergen’s 4 questions, and culture from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about the relationship between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, and the place of evolutionary psychology in the broader context of psychology and the social sciences. We discuss the insights we get by doing comparative psychology, and comparing ourselves to other animals. We talk about the cross-cultural nature of evolutionary psychology and if it has suffered from a replication crisis. We discuss studying morality from an evolutionary perspective, and if evolutionary psychology can be prescriptive. We talk about the politicization of evolutionary psychology. Finally, we discuss the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and Dr. Shackelford tells about the questions he would like to see tackled in evolutionary psychology.
