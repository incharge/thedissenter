RECORDED ON JANUARY 26th 2021.  
Dr. Christopher Kavanagh is an associate professor in the College of Contemporary Psychology at Rikkyo University and a researcher in cognitive anthropology at the Institute of Cognitive & Evolutionary Anthropology (ICEA) at the University of Oxford. Currently he is based in Japan where he conducts research in collaboration with Masaki Yuki’s Culture, Social Ecology, and Psychology Lab in Hokkaido University. His research interests include East Asian religions, ritual behavior, and the bonding effects of shared dysphoria. He is co-host of the Decoding the Gurus podcast.

In this episode, we talk about some topics in the cognitive science of religion, and WEIRD psychology. We start by defining religion, and talk a bit about its evolutionary and cultural foundations. We discuss how religion is practiced, and distinguish between orthopraxic and orthodoxic religions. We mention modes theory, and the best ways of studying religious rituals. We focus specifically on high-arousal rituals. We discuss minimally counterintuitive ideas. We talk about how relational mobility can explain certain aspects of religion. We address how people practice religion in Japan, and its supposed atheistic nature. Finally, we discuss WEIRD psychology, and the problem with distinguishing between individualist and collectivist societies.
