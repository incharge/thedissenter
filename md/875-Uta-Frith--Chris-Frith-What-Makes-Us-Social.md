They are authors of “What Makes Us Social?”.

In this episode, we focus on “What Makes Us Social?”. We start by discussing what social cognition is, and then go through topics like learning and imitation; emotions, our need to affiliate, and joint action; predicting other people’s behavior; group identity; reputation; trust; mentalizing; how high-level cognitive processes interact with low-level cognitive processes; consciousness; collective problem-solving; and teaching, cumulative culture, and the role of culture in human cognition. Finally, we discuss how we can foster cooperation.
