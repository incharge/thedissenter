RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 19th, 2020.  
Dr. Cristine Legare is a professor of psychology and the director of the Evolution, Variation, and Ontogeny of Learning Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. Her research examines how the human mind enables us to learn, create, and transmit culture. She conducts comparisons across age, culture, and species to address fundamental questions about cognitive and cultural evolution.

In this episode, we first talk about the phylogenetic and ontogenetic bases of culture. We also refer to the cognitive bases of culture. We ask if isolated individuals would ever develop culture. We discuss how children acquire culture; core knowledge, and how it varies across societies; causal learning; imitation; and natural and supernatural explanatory frameworks. We then address what renders it so difficult for people to accept and understand evolution by natural selection.
