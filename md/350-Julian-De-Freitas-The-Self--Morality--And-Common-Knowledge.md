Julian De Freitas is a cognitive scientist in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. He studies social intelligence, with a focus on the self, strategic thinking, and ethics.

In this episode, we talk about the self, morality, and common knowledge. We start by tackling the questions of what is really the “self”, and the relationship between the self and moral behavior. Then we talk about moral judgment, the optimality bias, common intuitions about the moral nature of the self, and morality, happiness, and the meaning of life. We also discuss common knowledge from a cognitive scientific and game theoretical perspectives. We refer to the relationship among common knowledge, collective coordination, and strategic thinking; how common knowledge explains the bystander effect better than the traditional explanation; and common knowledge and charitable behavior. Finally, we discuss if beliefs really cause behavior.
