Dr. Heather Berlin is an Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. She explores the neural basis of impulsive and compulsive psychiatric and neurological disorders with the aim of developing novel treatments. She is also interested in the brain basis of consciousness, dynamic unconscious processes, and creativity. Clinically, she specializes in lifespan treatment of anxiety, mood, and impulsive and compulsive disorders.

In this episode, we start by talking about impulsivity and compulsivity. We discuss the differences between impulsive and compulsive disorders, how they overlap, and their neural bases. We talk about disorders like kleptomania, pyromania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hypersexual behavior, and borderline personality disorder. We then discuss the study of consciousness, and talk about the history of conceptualizations about the unconscious, the dynamic unconscious, and a recent discussion surrounding the integrated information theory of consciousness. We also talk about suppression, repression, psychoanalysis, and accessing the unconscious; and the link between consciousness and the unconscious, and creativity. Finally, we discuss the challenges of science communication.
