RECORDED ON AUGUST 24th 2020.  
Dr. Russell T. Warne is Associate Professor of Psychology at Utah Valley University. Dr. Warne is the associate editor for the Journal for the Education of the Gifted and serves on the editorial boards for Intelligence, the Journal of School Psychology, Gifted Child Quarterly, and the Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment. Dr. Warne has published over 55 scholarly articles in peer reviewed journals and is the author of the acclaimed undergraduate statistics textbook Statistics for the Social Sciences: A General Linear Model Approach. His next book is In the Know: Debunking 35 Myths About Human Intelligence.

In this episode, we talk about standardized testing. We first talk about gifted students, and the Advanced Placement program in the US and Canada. We then discuss standardized tests, test bias, and the predictive validity of IQ tests. Finally, we ask if critical thinking and creativity is something useful to teach in schools, and how it should be taught.
