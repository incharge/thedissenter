RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th, 2019.  
Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology. Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining these models with a variety of research methods. He’s the author of Evolutionary Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.

In this episode, we go through the main topics of Dr. Del Giudice’s book, Evolutionary Psychopathology. He explains what the field is about, and how its approach differs from more traditional/mainstream ones in psychiatry and clinical psychology. Then we get into topics related to human development, like the canalization of developmental processes, motivational systems, and attachment styles. We also talk about behavioral genetics and differential susceptibility. Dr. Del Giudice explains the central approach to a new system of classification for mental disorders that he exposes in the book, the fast-slow-defense model (FSD). Toward the end, we also discuss the several different difficulties in classifying mental disorders.
