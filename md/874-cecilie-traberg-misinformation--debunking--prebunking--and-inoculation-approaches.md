RECORDED ON AUGUST 4th 2023.  
Cecilie Traberg is a Psychology PhD Candidate in the Social Decision-Making Lab at the University of Cambridge supervised by Professor Sander van der Linden where her work seeks to bridge the fields of social influence and cognitive science. Broadly speaking her research focuses on how groups act as sources of influence on our judgments and beliefs: including how intergroup biases impact our ability to assess the veracity of information, and how social cues and interactions with other people affect individual-level cognition.

In this episode, we talk about misinformation. We start by discussing what misinformation is. We talk about perceived source similarity and perceived source credibility. We discuss if liberals and conservatives are equally susceptible to misinformation. We talk about motivated cognition. We discuss inattention accounts of the sharing of fake news. We get into interventions to reduce susceptibility to fake news, and discuss how they are measured; debunking and prebunking approaches; inoculation theory; fact-based and technique-based approaches; and how effective inoculation against misinformation is. We also talk about Cecilie’s current work.
