RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 19th, 2019.  
Dr. Kathleen Stock is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sussex. She has published on aesthetics, fiction, imagination, and sexual objectification. She is currently the vice-president of the British Society of Aesthetics. In her monograph Only Imagine: Fiction, Interpretation and Imagination (2017) she examines the nature of fictional content. She has expressed critical views on the UK Gender Recognition Act and trans self-identification.

In this episode, we start by talking a little bit about the philosophy of fiction, and the sorts of topics that are explored there. Then, we establish a bridge with the topics of sex, gender and transgenderism, and go through issues about how the topic of transgenderism is being dealt with at a political level in Western society.
