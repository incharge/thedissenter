RECORDED ON JANUARY 3rd 2022.  
Dr. Dorothea Debus is Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at Konstanz University, with a special focus on the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. Her main area of research is the Philosophy of Mind. A substantial part of her published work is concerned with the mental phenomenon of memory; but she has also written on various other mental phenomena – imagination, attention, perception and the emotions. More recently her research has focused on a more general feature of our mental lives, namely the fact that we sometimes can be, and often also are, actively involved with how our own mental lives develop; she asks how we might possibly account for this ability, and explore its axiological implications.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of memory, and mental self-regulation. We start with a brief introduction to the questions explored in philosophy of mind and, more specifically, in the philosophy of memory. We get specifically into how we remember the past; the cognitive differences between remembering the past and imagining the future; how we understand the concept of the past; the causal theory of memory; and past-directed emotions, their role and epistemic value. We also discuss mental self-regulation.
