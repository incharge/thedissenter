Dr. Nadav Klein is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD. His research focuses on the basic processes of judgment that affect how people make decisions, process information, and evaluate others and themselves. Some of the findings Nadav has explored are the surprising reputational benefits of being a little bit nice to other people, the ability of groups to detect lies, people's weak desire to be seen as moral and strong desire not to be seen as immoral, and people's overestimation of how much information they use to make decisions.

In this episode, we go through several topics in social psychology. We start with social reputation, how we attribute it to other people, the process of individuation, and the traits that people tend to associate with it, namely the ones that cluster around warmth and competence. We then talk about prosociality, bounded self-righteousness, and if people think their own and the character of other people can change, and the kinds of changes that they value and find more inspirational. We also briefly address if we are good lie detectors, and why we do it better in groups. Finally, we talk about subjective wellbeing and meaningfulness in life.
