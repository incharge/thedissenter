In this episode, we talk about standardized testing. We first talk about gifted students, and the Advanced Placement program in the US and Canada. We then discuss standardized tests, test bias, and the predictive validity of IQ tests. Finally, we ask if critical thinking and creativity is something useful to teach in schools, and how it should be taught.
