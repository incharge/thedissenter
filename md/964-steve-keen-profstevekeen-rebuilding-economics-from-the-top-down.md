RECORDED ON JUNE 17th 2024.  
Dr. Steve Keen is former Associate Professor of Economics at University of Western Sydney, and former Professor and Head of the School of Economics, History and Politics at Kingston University in London. He is now an independent researcher in Economics, as well as a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute for Strategy Resilience & Security at University College London. He is the author of several books, the latest one being Rebuilding Economics from the Top Down.

In this episode, we focus on Rebuilding Economics from the Top Down. We first discuss what economics is and its role in society, and the main tenets of mainstream economics, with a focus on supply and demand. We also discuss why these ideas are mainstream, and its real-life consequences. We talk about the 2008 economic crisis and how it should have been dealt with. We talk about an alternative approach to economics based on complex systems theory, and explore the example of how employment rates and wages evolve over time. We also discuss debt, inflation, how prices are determined, how money is created, and the role of banks. We talk about what GDP is, and the differences between financial capitalism and industrial capitalism. Finally, we discuss the risks associated with climate change, and economic solutions to it.
