RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th 2023.  
Dr. Samuel Veissière is a clinician-researcher at RAPS (réseaux Recherche et Action sur les Polarisations Sociales), formerly Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at McGill University. He is an anthropologist and psychosocial clinician working at the intersection of psychiatry, cognitive science and the social sciences. Dr. Veissière has held multiple research grants to study the impact of the Internet on cognition, wellbeing and social relations. Past research includes leading experimental studies on social, symbolic, and ritual dimensions of placebo effects, and making original contributions to theoretical models of the co-evolution of cognition and culture that draw on Bayesian brain, active inference, and ecological niche construction paradigms. His current works examines risk and protective factors against violent radicalization and extremism, with an emphasis on digital, narrative, and gendered dimensions of social polarization.

In this episode, we first talk about the psychological effects of the internet, and its impact on sociality. We also talk about smartphone addiction. We discuss the role that culture plays in mental health. We talk about placebos from an anthropological and clinical perspective, including super placebos and neuroplacebos. Finally, we discuss a Free Energy approach to human cognition and culture, how humans learn shared expectations and norms, and how social conformity develops.
