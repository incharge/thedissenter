Dr. Valerie Hardcastle is St. Elizabeth Healthcare Executive Director of the Institute for Health Innovation and Vice President for Health Innovation at Northern Kentucky University. Dr. Hardcastle specializes in philosophy of neuroscience/biology, philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of psychology, and philosophical implications of psychiatry. She researches bioethics/neuroethics, behavioral neuroscience, neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, and philosophy of mind. She teaches metaphysics, science studies, feminist philosophy of science. She is the author of several books, including Locating Consciousness, The Myth of Pain, and Constructing the Self.

In this episode, we talk about the self, consciousness, pain, and psychiatry. We discuss what the self is and how people construct it. We talk about consciousness, its causal relationship to other aspects of the mind, and how to better study it. We talk about how pain is complex process. We ask if it is possible to distinguish between normal and abnormal psychological conditions, and what we can learn about by mind by studying conditions where it goes awry. Finally, we discuss the relationship between neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and psychiatry, and the role philosophers play in these fields.
