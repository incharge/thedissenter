RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 25th 2022.  
Dr. Dario Maestripieri is a Professor in Comparative Human Development and is also affiliated with the Institute on the Formation of Knowledge at the University of Chicago. His current main interests are, a) evolution of human behavior and its biological regulation, b) 20th century European literature.

In this episode, we talk about human nature, individual differences, knowledge, and consilience. We discuss what human nature is, how to account for individual differences in human behavior, and personality. We ask if humans are an aggressive or peaceful species. We discuss the costs and benefits of knowledge and ignorance. We talk about what we can learn about human nature by studying art and literature. Finally, we discuss if knowledge is unitary, the concept of consilience, and how we can reach it.
