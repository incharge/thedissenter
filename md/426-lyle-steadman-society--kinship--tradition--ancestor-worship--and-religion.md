RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 24th 2020.  
Dr. Lyle Steadman is Professor Emeritus at Arizona State University. Dr. Steadman focuses on religion and kinship, especially their interrelationship, and the influence of natural selection on human social and cultural behavior. He has done extensive research among the Hewa, a society in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. A short period of fieldwork was also conducted in an Indian village in Baja California, Mexico.

In this episode, we talk about kinship and religion. We first discuss the Hewa, and then get into aspects of human sociality, and go through topics like kin selection, group selection, kinship systems, tradition, ancestor worship, religion, and shamanism.
