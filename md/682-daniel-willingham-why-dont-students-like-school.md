RECORDED ON JULY 5th 2022.  
Dr. Daniel Willingham is Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia. Until about 2000, his research focused solely on the brain basis of learning and memory. Today, all of his research concerns the application of cognitive psychology to K-16 education. He is the author of books like Cognition: The Thinking Animal, Why Don't Students Like School?: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom, and Outsmart Your Brain.

In this episode, we focus on “Why Don’t Students Like School?”. Topics include: why the brain is not designed for thinking, and what people like to think about; why students need factual knowledge, and not just critical thinking skills; the transference of knowledge between domains; the importance of extended practice; individual differences in intelligence; what distinguishes experts from laypeople; learning styles; multiple intelligences; growth mindset; and the impact of technology on education.
