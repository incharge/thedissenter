Dr. Evelina Fedorenko is Middleton CD Associate Professor of Neuroscience in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT. Her research focuses on the language system, including its internal architecture, and its relationship with other cognitive systems. She uses behavioral, fMRI, intracranial recording, computational, and genotyping methods in healthy adults and individuals with brain disorders.

In this episode, we talk about the language system. We talk about the areas of the brain where language is processed; how it is tied to other aspects of cognition; and if it is a biological adaptation. We discuss the role that it plays in categorization. We talk about non-verbal semantic processing. We discuss if there are cognitive differences between multilinguals and monolinguals. We talk about cross-cultural research in neuroscience. We discuss if there is a relationship between language and music. We talk about the use of artificial neural networks and mapping models to study language. Finally, we discuss if language processing is connected to general intelligence.
