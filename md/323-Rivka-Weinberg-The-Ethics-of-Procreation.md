RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 6th, 2020.

Dr. Rivka Weinberg is a professor of philosophy at Scripps College in Claremont, California. As a philosopher and bioethicist, Dr. Weinberg specializes in ethical and metaphysical issues regarding birth, death, and meaning. She’s the author of the book The Risk of a Lifetime: How, When, and Why Procreation May Be Permissible. 

In this episode, we talk about the ethics of procreation. We first discuss antinatalism, and some of its flaws. We then get into the ethics of procreation, and go through several different topics, like dealing with life as a risk; the justifications people usually give to procreate; the Hazmat theory of parental responsibility; when procreation is permissible; abortion; adoption; and reproductive technology. Finally, we talk about connections between procreative ethics and the ethics of suicide and euthanasia.
