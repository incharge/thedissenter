This is our second interview on the anthropology of war. You can find the first one here: https://youtu.be/uz9xPBQ_CO0

In this episode, we expand on the topics I covered in our first interview, and talk about: how old is war; what drives war – factors like population density, sedentarism, and social complexity; how we can be sure that a death in the archaeological record was caused by war; peace social systems, and how they are maintained, both in traditional small-scale societies and industrialized societies; and how we can promote peace and international cooperation, and in dealing with threats like global pandemics and climate change. Finally, we talk about Dr. Fry’s upcoming book on peace systems.
