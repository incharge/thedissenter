Dr. Diane Halpern is Dean Emerita of Social Sciences at Minerva Schools at Keck Graduate Institute and former Emerita Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College. She has won many awards for her teaching and research, including an Honorary Award in 2016 from the Federation for Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS) for "scientists who have made important and lasting contributions to the sciences of mind, brain, and behavior" and the 2013 Association for Psychological Science James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award for a lifetime of outstanding contributions to applied psychological research, the Outstanding Professor Award from the Western Psychological Association, the American Psychological Foundation Award for Distinguished Teaching, the Distinguished Career Award for Contributions to Education given by the American Psychological Association, and the California State University’s State-Wide Outstanding Professor Award. She is also a past-president of the American Psychological Association and the Society for Teaching of Psychology. Finally, she’s the author of books like Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities, and Thought and Knowledge: An Introduction to Critical Thinking.

In this episode, we talk about sex differences in cognitive abilities, some issues we have to take into account, the biopsychosocial model, and the biological and social aspects of “gender”. We also refer to the gender wage gap, and striking a balance between one’s professional and personal lives, and if the proposal of going back to same-sex schooling has any merit. Finally, we talk about critical thinking, the types of skills that it involves, how we can teach them to people (children and adults), and about creativity.
