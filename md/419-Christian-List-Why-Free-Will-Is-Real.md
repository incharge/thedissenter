RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 12th 2020.  
Dr. Christian List is Professor of Philosophy and Decision Theory at LMU Munich and Co-Director of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. He’s the author of Why Free Will Is Real.

In this episode, we talk about Why Free Will Is Real. We start with some basic questions, like what is free will, and what is an agent. We then get into the moral side of things, and talk about moral responsibility and the law. We address three major challenges to free will (the “challenge from radical materialism,” the “challenge from determinism,” and the “challenge from epiphenomenalism”). We discuss mind-brain dualism and emergentism. Finally, we ask if free will exists in other living beings, in nonliving entities, and in robots and advanced AI.
