Dr. Isabella Sarto-Jackson is Lecturer in Cognitive Science at the University of Vienna, Guest Lecturer in Cognitive Biology at the University of Bratislava, executive manager of the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research, and president of the Austrian Neuroscience Association (ANA). She is the author of The Making and Breaking of Minds: How social interactions shape the human mind.

In this episode, we focus on The Making and Breaking of Minds. We go through topics in human psychology, including the nature/nurture debate; behavior genetics, twin studies, and the role of genes; the idea of genetic susceptibility, instead of genetic determinism; how to study environmental factors; niche construction; and gene-culture coevolution. We also discuss neuroscience: the concept of neuroplasticity, how it works and its limits; and localizationism, modularity of mind, and evolutionary psychology. We talk about issues with how we understand “normal” development and psychopathology; “looping effects” in the study of mental disorders; the biopsychosocial model; socioeconomic structures and systemic discrimination; and the neurodiversity movement. We also discuss what traumatic experiences are; attachment theory, and how we develop attachment styles; and how children develop resilience. We finish by commenting on how science works.
