RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 30th 2020.  
Dr. David C. Geary is Curators’ Professor and Thomas Jefferson Fellow in the Department of Psychological Sciences and Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. He’s the author of several books including Children's mathematical development, Male, female: The evolution of human sex differences, and Evolution of vulnerability: Implications for sex differences in health and development.

In this episode, we talk about “Male, Female”, whose third edition has just come out. We cover topics like the evolutionary origins of sex differences; how sex is defined from a biological perspective; sexual selection, mate preferences, and mating strategies in humans; the development of sex differences in children; sex differences in core knowledge (folk psychology, folk biology, and folk physics); how sex differences translate into educational and occupational attainment; the distinction between sex and gender; and the politics of gender.
