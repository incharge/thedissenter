In this episode, we talk data science and new approaches in literary studies and literary criticism. We go through some of the major ways literature changed throughout history, and talk about the impact of industrialization, rereading, repeating, and punctuation marks. We also discuss what distinguishes fiction from nonfiction, and new ways of doing literary criticism. Finally, we talk about how digital media changes reading, and the study of social and cultural phenomena through literature.
