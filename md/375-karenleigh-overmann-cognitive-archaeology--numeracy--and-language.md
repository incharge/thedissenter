Dr. Karenleigh A. Overmann is an associate professor of anthropology (adjunct) at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) Center for Cognitive Archaeology. She recently completed two years of postdoctoral research at the University of Bergen (MSCA individual fellowship, EU project 785793). She earned her doctorate in archaeology from the University of Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She also has a master's degree (psychology) and bachelor's (anthropology, philosophy, English) from UCCS. She’s the editor of Squeezing Minds From Stones: Cognitive Archaeology and the Evolution of the Human Mind.

In this episode, we talk about cognitive archaeology. First, we go through some basics, and ask what are archaeological remnants, and where archaeology starts in our evolutionary history, and we also talk about cumulative culture, and the discipline of cognitive archaeology. We discuss if modern hunter-gatherers make for good models of ancient peoples, and what we can learn about cognition from ancient artifacts. We ask if technology expands our cognitive capacities, and the get into more specific topics, like the relationship between tool-making and tool-use and conceptualization, and language. We also talk about numeracy and literacy.
