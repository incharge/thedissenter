RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2022.  
Dr. Melanie MacEacheron is a Lecturer in the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Arizona State University. Her current research focus is women's psychology as potential or actual mothers or allomothers, and sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. Of particular interest to her, is our ability to creatively label or act on evolved desires in order to serve our evolutionary interests, even or especially where these are not consciously known to us, and to influence others.

In this episode, we focus mostly on motherhood and marital surname changes. We start with the questions that the evolutionary psychology of motherhood focusses on, and also discuss allomothering. We talk about sex differences in mateships and romantic relationships. We discuss marital surname changes and several factors and predictors associated with them, like earning capacity and economic inequality. We also discuss outcomes like marital duration, and number of children. Finally, we ask if feminism and evolutionary psychology really need to be in conflict with one another.
