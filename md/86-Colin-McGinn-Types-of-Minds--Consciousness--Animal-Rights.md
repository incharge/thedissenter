Dr. Colin McGinn has taught philosophy at institutions of higher learning including University College London, Rutgers University, and Oxford University. He’s the author of over two dozen books including The Character of Mind, Consciousness and Its Objects, and The Making of a Philosopher, and he has also written for the London Review of Books, The New Republic, Wall Street Journal, The New York Review of Books, and other publications. 

In this episode, I talk with Dr. McGinn about minds and consciousness. More specifically, about what is a mind; the different types of minds; how to avoid dualism; if the phenomenology of consciousness can be scientifically explained; the continuity of mental capacities between animals; a couple of science fiction proposals, like creating conscious machines, and mind uploading; and animal rights.
