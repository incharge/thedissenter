She is the editor of 'Women of Ideas' published with Oxford University Press which is a selection of interviews with women from Philosophy Bites.

In this episode, we talk about the epistemology of logic, the philosophy of love, and the metaphysics of pregnancy. We first discuss the epistemology of logic, and the relationship between logic and rationality. We then get into the philosophy of love, and talk about unconditional love, Bayesian probability theory, and games like poker. Finally, we discuss the metaphysics of pregnancy, and go through questions like if the fetus if a part of the mother, abortion, birth, and pregnancy-related technologies.
