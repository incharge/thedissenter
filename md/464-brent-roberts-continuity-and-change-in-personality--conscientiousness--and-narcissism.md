RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 4th 2021.  
Dr. Brent W. Roberts is a Professor of Psychology and Director of the Center for Social and Behavioral Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Roberts's research has focused on determining the replicable patterns of continuity and change in personality traits across adulthood, the life experiences associated with changes in personality traits over time, and the significance of these changes for individual functioning. Dr. Roberts also conducts research on psychometric issues, in particular how to measure the traits of conscientiousness and narcissism, and more recently, how to best assess socio-emotional skills.

In this episode, we talk about personality psychology. We discuss models of personality traits; continuity and change in personality traits across the lifespan; if old people can change their personality; potential individual differences in personality malleability; how culture influences personality; personality and social roles; gender differences in personality; conscientiousness and life outcomes; and narcissism.
