RECORDED ON MARCH 3rd 2022.  
Dr. Simon Garnier is an Associate Professor of Biology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the head of the Swarm Lab, an interdisciplinary research lab that studies the mechanisms underlying Collective Behaviors and Swarm Intelligence in natural and artificial systems (http://www.theswarmlab.com). His research aims to reveal the detailed functioning of collective intelligence in systems as diverse as ant colonies, human crowds or robotic swarms.

In this episode, we talk about swarm intelligence. Topics include: examples of swarm intelligence in biological systems; collective decision-making; aggregation behavior; information; decision-making without brains or nervous systems, and embodied cognition; human crowds and collective intelligence; and phenomena that we could get a better grasp of through swarm intelligence, like human crowd motion, politics, and culture.
