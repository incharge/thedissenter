In this episode, the conversation is centered on stereotypes. We talk a little bit about the history of looking at stereotypes as inaccurate; how we can test their accuracy; if they affect people’s perception of the groups they’re targeted at; stereotype threats; self-fulfilling prophecies; the validity of implicit bias testing; and some issues with political bias in Social Psychology, and social constructivism.
