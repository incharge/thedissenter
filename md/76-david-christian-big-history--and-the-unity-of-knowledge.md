Dr. David Christian is Professor at the Department of Modern History, Politics and International Relations at Macquarie University. He is notable for teaching and promoting the discipline of Big History. He is credited with coining the term Big History and he serves as president of the International Big History Association.

In this episode, we focus on Big History. Topics include: the methodological differences between Big History and traditional History; new views on the human condition and the meaning of life; the impact agriculture had on human life; how to look at progress; predictions about the future; and how Big History can contribute to establish a common ground for the sciences and the humanities.
