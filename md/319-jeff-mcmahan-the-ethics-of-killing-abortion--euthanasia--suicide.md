RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th, 2020.  
Dr. Jeff McMahan is White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics, Political Philosophy, and Ethics. He’s the author of books like The Morality of Nationalism, The Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing in War.

In this episode, we talk about the ethics of killing. We first clarify what is death and what constitutes an act of killing. We discuss the connection between psychological capacities and moral status, and the notions of personal identity, egoistic concern, and the interest in one’s future. We address abortion and infanticide. We then get into a discussion surrounding how we decide that a life is worth living. We also include topics like personality variability, and end-of-life cases life euthanasia and suicide. We talk about what is a “good life” for people and other animals. Finally, we explore what is ethically different between killing and letting die.
