RECORDED ON JANUARY 24th 2022.  
Dr. Scott Claessens is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Auckland. He studies the biological and cultural evolution of human cooperation. He uses methods from experimental economics and evolutionary game theory to shed light on how and why we give to others.

In this episode, we talk about human cooperation, religiosity, and cross-national analyses. We discuss theories about why humans are so cooperative; the benefits people get from being seen to be cooperative; the “cooperative phenotype”, and what personality traits might correlate with prosociality; why prosociality varies across societies; if prosociality is associated with relational mobility; and what need-based transfer systems are. We talk about the relationship between religiosity and prosociality and well-being. Finally, we discuss the issue of non-independence in cross-national analyses.
