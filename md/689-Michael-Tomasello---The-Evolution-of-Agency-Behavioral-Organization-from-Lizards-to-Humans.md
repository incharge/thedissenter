Dr. Michael Tomasello is Emeritus Director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, and James F. Bonk Distinguished Professor at Duke University. He is considered one of today's most authoritative developmental and comparative psychologists. He’s the author of several books, including The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition (1999), A Natural History of Human Thinking (2014), A Natural History of Human Morality (2016), and Becoming Human: A Theory of Ontogeny (2019). His most recent book is The Evolution of Agency: Behavioral Organization from Lizards to Humans.

In this episode, we focus on The Evolution of Agency. We talk about agency from an evolutionary perspective, focusing on the feedback control model of agency, and go through evolutionary history, touching on the first animate actors, the first goal-directed agents, the first intentional agents, the first rational agents, and the first socially normative agents. We talk about some representatives of each of them. We discuss where goals come from, the role of emotions, the understanding of agency in animals, social norms, and the role of culture in collective agency. We also discuss the aspects of sociality that are uniquely human. Finally, we talk about free will.
