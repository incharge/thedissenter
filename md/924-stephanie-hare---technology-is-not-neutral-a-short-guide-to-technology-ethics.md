In this episode, we focus on Technology It Not Neutral. We start by talking about technology ethics, and we discuss arguments for and against technology being neutral. We discuss what is a tool, and if scientific discoveries are value-free. We talk about design bias, and the example of policing. We discuss the problem with sci-fi fiction, existential risks, and distracting from real threats. We talk about social media, clickbait, misinformation, online privacy, data collection, and regulation. Finally, we discuss digital health tools used during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if they were worth it.
