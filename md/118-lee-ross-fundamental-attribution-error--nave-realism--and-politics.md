Dr. Lee Ross is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and co-founder of the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation. He’s been the recipient of several awards. The author of three influential books, Human Inference and the Person and the Situation (both with Richard Nisbett) and, more recently, The Wisest One in the Room (with Thomas Gilovich), and many highly cited papers. His research on attributional biases and shortcomings in human inference has exerted a major impact in social psychology and the field of human inference, judgment and decision-making. Among the phenomena he identified and has explored are the fundamental attribution error, the false consensus effect, reactive devaluation, the hostile media phenomenon, and the convictions of naïve realism.   
In this episode, we cover the psychological phenomena that were the main targets of Dr. Ross’ academic research. These include: the fundamental attribution error; the just world phenomenon; cultural differences in how people apply the fundamental attribution error; naïve realism, the false consensus effect, and objectivity in the eye of the beholder; reactive devaluation in the case of trying to solve a problem between opposing human groups or political parties; and the possible ways to get around these human cognitive inclinations.
