RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 7th, 2019.  
Dr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Nicosia, Cyprus. He was born in Athens, Greece and he completed his post-graduate and graduate studies in the United Kingdom. He has published several peer-reviewed papers, books and chapters in books in the area of evolutionary psychology.

In this episode, we focus on the evolutionary bases of singlehood, parent-offspring conflict and mating control, and the evolution of human sexuality. We start with singlehood, and discuss it as a contextual strategy, and also why so many people in modern societies are single and have difficulty getting and retaining a mate. We also refer to mating in traditional (hunter-gatherer) and historical societies, and the psychological costs of being single. We then move on to mating control by parents, how parents manipulate their offspring’s mate choices, and how societies developed mating control institutions. Finally, we address the complex issue of the evolution of homosexuality and bisexuality in humans.
