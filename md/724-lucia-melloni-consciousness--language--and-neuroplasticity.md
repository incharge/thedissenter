RECORDED ON OCTOBER 14th 2022.  
Dr. Lucia Melloni is a Research Leader of the Neural Circuits, Consciousness and Cognition Group at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics. Her research areas include domain-general cortical computations, neural mechanisms by which the brain predictively controls sensory processing and perception, brain mechanism subserving language comprehension, and possibilities and limits of brain plasticity to restore cognitive functions.

In this episode, we talk about consciousness, language, and neuroplasticity. We start with consciousness, how it is studied in neuroscience, the neural correlates of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, and its causal power over behavior. We discuss conscious perception, and how language connects to consciousness. Finally, we talk about the limits of neuroplasticity.
