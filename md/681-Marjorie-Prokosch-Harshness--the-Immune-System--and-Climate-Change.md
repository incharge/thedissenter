excerpt: Dr. Marjorie Prokosch is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Disasters, Trust,
  and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida, and an incoming Assistant Professor
  at the Rochester Institute of Technology. She studies social and health-related
  decision-making, with an emphasis on how environmental threats (such as the threat
  posed by infectious disease) and our own condition (e.g., our immune system, developmental
  experiences with harshness) motivate our perceptions and behavior. Specific areas
  of interest include risk perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. In
  her current role at UF, she is examining how environmental hazards (like hurricanes)
  and climate change threats intersect with social inequality to impact decision-making.

Dr. Marjorie Prokosch is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Disasters, Trust, and Social Change Lab at the University of Florida, and an incoming Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. She studies social and health-related decision-making, with an emphasis on how environmental threats (such as the threat posed by infectious disease) and our own condition (e.g., our immune system, developmental experiences with harshness) motivate our perceptions and behavior. Specific areas of interest include risk perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. In her current role at UF, she is examining how environmental hazards (like hurricanes) and climate change threats intersect with social inequality to impact decision-making.

In this episode, we talk about harshness, the immune system, and climate change. We start with how harshness impacts psychological development, and how it affects risk perception, self-regulation, and close relationships. We talk about the connection between the immune system and psychology and behavior. We discuss how threats of infectious disease change behavior, and the implications for Public Health. Finally, we talk about Dr. Prokosch’s ongoing work on people’s perceptions of climate change, and its relationship with inequality.
