RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 3rd 2023.  
Dr. Antoine Marie is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark. He is an evolutionary political psychologist with a background in philosophy, sociology, political science, and social psychology. He conducts cross-cultural psychology experiments and develops evolutionary theory to better understand, and if possible, mitigate, the cognitive biases that arise from people having strong moral convictions on controversial topics, typically in contexts of perceived intergroup conflict.

In this episode, we start by talking about how people evaluate political decisions. We then talk about the link between moral convictions and the sharing of partisan news on social media, and the social functions of holding and disseminating political conspiracy theories. We discuss how people process and understand evidence of gender bias in hiring processes. Finally, we talk about ideological orthodoxy, and the repression of free speech.
