RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 12th 2022.  
Dr. Denis Tatone is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Cognitive Development Center at Central European University. He is a cognitive scientist broadly interested in the evolution and development of social cognition. His research focuses on how the mind represents the social world in terms of its constituent interactions, relations, and structures. He strives to develop a mechanistically tractable account of how humans from the first years of life form and flexibly transition among these representations.

In this episode, we talk about how infants interpret giving and taking actions, and the development of prosociality. We start with giving and taking actions, and talk about expectations surrounding giving; how infants think about possession; norms of ownership, and how they vary cross-culturally; expectations surrounding reciprocation; how infants infer social relations from giving and taking actions; and how giving actions influence how they encode objects. We then get into prosociality, and ask if infants prefer helpers or hinderers. Finally, we discuss if there are stages of development for prosociality.
