RECORDED ON JANUARY 20th 2022.  
Dr. Hannah K. Bradshaw is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Washington and Jefferson College. Dr. Bradshaw is an interdisciplinary-minded psychologist who incorporates methodological tools from social psychology, marketing, health psychology, industrial/organizational psychology, and psychoneuroimmunology. Her research program explores how interpersonal and ecological cues might affect our perceptions and decisions in the broader social world. While she has a wide variety of research interests, she tends to gravitate towards questions that pertain to disgust sensitivity, women’s sociality, and consumer preferences and behavior.

In this episode, we talk about female beauty, beautification, economics and luxury products, and food choices. We start by talking about why people value female beauty, and how it triggers sexual competition. We get into appearance enhancement and beautification penalties. We discuss the value of luxury goods in the context of economic scarcity, and how women like status and earning capacity in men. We talk about women’s trust in female vs gay male sales’ associates. Finally, we talk about why people make unhealthy food choices, and how people other people who are willing to try new foods, in terms of sexual unrestrictedness and desirability.
