RECORDED ON OCTOBER 25th 2021.  
Dr. William Glod is Senior Program Officer at the Institute for Humane Studies, an educational non-profit affiliated with George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. He is the author of Why It’s OK to Make Bad Choices.

In this episode, we focus on Why It’s OK to Make Bad Choices. We first discuss how we determine that a particular choice is a bad one. We talk about paternalism – coercive and libertarian. We discuss matters related to free will, and State regulations. We talk about the potential life benefits of making bad choices, and if people should care about their effects on others. We discuss if there are cases where other people should interfere. Finally, Dr. Glod tells us if, generally-speaking, it is OK for people to make bad choices.
