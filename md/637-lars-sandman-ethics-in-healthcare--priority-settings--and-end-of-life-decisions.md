In this episode, we talk about ethics in healthcare. We talk about organizational ethics in healthcare, and the questions it deals with. We discuss Person Centered Care and Personalized Medicine. We talk about healthcare priority settings, and the example of plastic surgery. We discuss patient involvement in health policy development and in medical decisions. We talk about how people think about withholding and withdrawing treatment for cost‐effectiveness reasons. Finally, we discuss end-of-life decisions, and ask if there is such a thing as a good life, and if people should be allowed to choose how and when they die.
