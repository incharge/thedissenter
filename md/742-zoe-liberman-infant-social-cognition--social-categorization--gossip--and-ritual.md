RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 17th 2022.  
Dr. Zoe Liberman is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Liberman investigates the origins and development of human social cognition. She is particularly interested in how infants begin to understand our complicated social world, as well as how this understanding changes across development and is shaped by experience. Her research focuses on early social categorization. Dr. Liberman is also interested in the malleability of early social categorization, including the effects of growing up in a multilingual (or otherwise diverse) environment. 

In this episode, we talk about infant social cognition. We start by discussing if there is any particular period in development when children start getting socialized. We talk about how children learn about particular individuals, and how they know who knows what. We discuss social categorization, and how children learn to distinguish between ingroups and outgroups. We talk about how children decide who is friends with them and who is not, and cues like resource sharing, similarity, loyalty, and secret sharing. We also discuss how children determine when a piece gossip might be biased, and when participating in rituals becomes relevant in child development.
