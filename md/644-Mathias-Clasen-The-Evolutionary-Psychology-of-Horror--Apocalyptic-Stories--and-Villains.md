Dr. Mathias Clasen is associate professor in literature and media at Aarhus University. He is the Director of the Recreational Fear Lab, and Associate Editor of Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture. He studies horror fiction, and is the author of Why Horror Seduces, and A Very Nervous Person's Guide to Horror Movies.

In this episode, we talk about horror from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss horror from an evolutionary perspective, and the sociocultural factors behind it. We talk about the traits of monsters, and the different types of horror. We talk about slasher movies, and apocalyptic stories. We get into human universals in horror, what makes for popular monsters, and what makes some films “so-bad-they’re-good”. We discuss the relationship between personality traits and art appreciation. We discuss a study on the relationship between being morbidly curious and more psychologically resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we talk about what an evolutionary approach adds to the picture in literary studies.
