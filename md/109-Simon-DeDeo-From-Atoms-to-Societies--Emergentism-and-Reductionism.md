THIS TIME, IT’S AUDIO-ONLY. I’VE BEEN HAVING SOME ISSUES WITH THE RECORDING PROGRAM THAT I HOPE TO SOLVE DEFINITELLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. PLEASE ENJOY!

Dr. Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor in Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He also runs the Laboratory for Social Minds, were he and his team undertake empirical investigations, and build mathematical theories, of both historical and contemporary phenomena.

In this episode, we talk about the ways we can apply knowledge and mathematical models from Physics to the study of human social behavior and cultural evolution. We also deal with the philosophical issue of emergentism vs reductionism.
