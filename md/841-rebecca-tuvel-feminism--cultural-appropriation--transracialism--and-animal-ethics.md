RECORDED ON MAY 26th 2023.  
Dr. Rebecca Tuvel is Associate Professor and Chair of Philosophy at Rhodes College. She works in feminist philosophy, philosophy of race, and the ethics of identity. Her book project Changing Race: The Ethics and Metaphysics of Transracialism explores the possibility and permissibility of changing one’s race.

In this episode, we talk about feminism, cultural appropriation, the philosophy of race, and animal ethics. We discuss what it means to be a feminist, and why are there so few people identifying as feminists. We talk about feminism and intersectionality today. We discuss if feminism should include trans women. We talk about epistemic exclusions, the historical exclusion of women’s knowledge, and we discuss if there can also be injustices in epistemic inclusion. We discuss if cultural appropriation is a problem. We talk about the philosophy of race, and go through three main different philosophical approaches to race: race anti-realism, social realism, and biological realism. We discuss transracialism, if people can change their race, if they should be allowed to do so, and if it is analogous to changing one’s gender identity. Finally, we talk about animal ethics, and discuss if we should use the knowledge that comes from animal experimentation.
