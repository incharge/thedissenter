Dr. Johannes Mahr is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Schacter Memory Lab at Harvard University. He will be a professor of Philosophy at York University in Toronto. Before that, he was a Mind, Brain, and Behavior Fellow with a joint appointment in the Departments of Philosophy and Psychology at Harvard. He completed his PhD in Cognitive Science under the supervision of Gergely Csibra and Dan Sperber at Central European University. His work combines philosophical and empirical approaches to study episodic memory, imagination, and human communication.

In this episode, we talk about episode memory and imagination. We first talk about episodic memory, what it is, what the ability to remember the past entails, why we have it, and thinking about the future. We discuss the relationship between memory and human communication, and the social functions of memory. Finally, we talk about imagination, and why we have this ability.
