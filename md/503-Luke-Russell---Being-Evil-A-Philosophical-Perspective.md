In this episode, we focus on Being Evil. We ask what evil is, and go through several different criteria we can use to say that a particular action or person in evil, including its extremity, the consequences, incomprehensibility, people’s reactions, the perpetrator’s motives, and others. We talk about depictions of evil in fiction, and ask if they are useful. We discuss some possible psychological traits of evil people, and refer to Arendt’s banality of evil. Finally, we discuss if people are born evil, and what we can do to help them.
