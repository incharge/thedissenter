RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 29th 2021.  
Dr. Robert Brooks is Professor of Evolution at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. He studies the evolution of mate choice, the costs of being attractive, sexual conflict, the reason animals age and the links between sex, diet, obesity and death. He is the author of Sex, Genes & Rock ‘n’ Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World, and, more recently, Artificial Intimacy: Virtual Friends, Digital Lovers, and Algorithmic Matchmakers.

In this episode, we focus on Artificial Intimacy. We talk about why a biologist would focus on sex technology. We go through the biology of intimacy, and the biology of love and romantic relationships, and how new technology exploits them. We discuss the effects technology might have on mating strategies, and on gender roles. We talk about the incel movement, and some equivalents in Japan, and how in Japan people deal with romantic rejection differently. Finally, we talk about how lowering the price of sex might be good, and how technology can help with that.
