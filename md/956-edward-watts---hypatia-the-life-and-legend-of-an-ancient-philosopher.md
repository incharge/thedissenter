RECORDED ON JANUARY 19th 2024.  
Dr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis Professor of Byzantine Greek History at the University of California, San Diego, where he was formerly Co-Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies. His research interests center on the intellectual and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is the author of several books on ancient history, including Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny, The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea, and Hypatia: The Life and Legend of an Ancient Philosopher.

In this episode, we focus on Hypatia. We first get into the social, political, and historical context where Hypatia lived, and the intellectual life in Alexandria. We then talk about her early years, how she became a philosopher and the head of a philosophy school, her main intellectual contributions, her political life and public service, and her tragic death and its aftermath. We also discuss her intellectual legacy, how she has been portrayed by artists, and what she symbolizes for modern people.
