RECORDED ON JANUARY 16th 2023.  
Dr. Sander van der Linden is Professor of Social Psychology in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab. His research interests center around the psychology of human judgment, communication, and decision-making, including social norms and networks, attitudes and polarization, reasoning about evidence, and the public understanding of risk and uncertainty. He is the author of Foolproof: Why Misinformation Infects Our Minds and How to Build Immunity.

In this episode, we focus on Foolproof. We start by distinguishing misinformation from disinformation, and then discuss if misinformation is on the rise, and if it spreads easier online. We talk about the psychological mechanisms that make us susceptible to it, and demographic data. We discuss if the brain is Bayesian, and if intelligent and more educated people are more susceptible to misinformation. We talk about conspiratorial thinking. We discuss debunking and prebunking, and which of them works better. We talk about social media, echo chambers and filter bubbles, who spreads misinformation the most, and if it influences political behavior. Finally, we talk about how to inoculate people against misinformation.
