RECORDED ON OCTOBER 12th 2020.  
Dr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis Professor of Byzantine Greek History at UC San Diego, where he was formerly Co-Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies. His research interests center on the intellectual and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is the author of several books on ancient history, the most recent one being Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny. He also has a new book coming out in 2021, The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea.

In this episode, we focus on Mortal Republic. We go through the several different political organizations that Rome had – the kingdom, the republic, and the empire -, and some of their major players, like the patricians, the Gracchi brothers (Tiberius and Gaius), and Julius Caesar. We then ask if there are any lessons we can take from the Roman Republic for modern politics, Great-Man vs. Great-Ideas theories of History, and if History really does repeat itself.
