In this episode, we talk about family relationships and dynamics from an evolutionary perspective. We focus on conflict between couples, the role of jealousy and some mate retention tactics, including sperm competition for men. We address how monogamy might have evolved. Then, we move on to parent-offspring competition and sibling competition, and how the first might potentiate the second. We also talk a bit about religiosity, and how it might get transmitted between parents and their children. And we end up discussing the possible relationship between kin selection and reciprocal altruism.
