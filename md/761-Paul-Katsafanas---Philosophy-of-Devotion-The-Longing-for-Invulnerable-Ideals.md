RECORDED ON MARCH 22nd 2023.  
Dr. Paul Katsafanas is Professor of Philosophy and Director of Graduate Studies at Boston University. He works on ethics, moral psychology, and nineteenth-century philosophy. His latest book is Philosophy of Devotion: The Longing for Invulnerable Ideals.

This is our second interview. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/o7LxgsSZbZk

In this episode, we focus on Philosophy of Devotion. We start by discussing what devotion is. We talk about the psychological features of sacred values; psychological strategies for treating commitments and fixed and immutable; and the connection between sacred values and devotion. We discuss a connection between devotion and nihilism, and we get into different accounts of fanaticism. Finally, we talk about how we can hold sacred values and avoid fanaticism, through irony, affirmation, and the “deepening move”.
