RECORDED ON DECEMBER 1st 2020.  
Dr. Andrew Berry is a lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. He is an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in Alfred Russel Wallace. His research combined field and laboratory methods to detect positive Darwinian selection (i.e. adaptive evolution) at the molecular level in natural populations. He has published two books: Infinite tropics: an Alfred Russel Wallace Anthology, with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould, and DNA: The Secret of Life with James Watson.

In this episode, we talk about the history of evolutionary biology. We start with the early developments by Darwin and Wallace, and we also mention some precursors to evolutionary biology and even some early evolutionary biologists before Darwin and Wallace. We then get into Mendelian genetics, and the development of population genetics. Finally, we talk about the path that let to the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in evolutionary biology.
