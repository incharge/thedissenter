Dr. Branko Milanović is Presidential Professor at the Graduate Center and a senior fellow at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at The City University of New York (CUNY). Dr. Milanović’s main area of work is income inequality, in individual countries and globally, as well as historically, among pre-industrial societies (Roman Empire, Byzantium, and France before the Revolution), and even inequality in soccer. His latest book is Visions of Inequality: From the French Revolution to the End of the Cold War.

This is our second interview. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/engIPGdURnY

In this episode, we focus on Visions of Inequality. We start by talking about how long people have been thinking about economic inequality, and the elements of the best income distribution studies. We then go through the work of authors like François Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Vilfredo Pareto, and Simon Kuznets, and how there was a natural progression across them. We discuss how and why studies of income distribution went into retreat during the Cold War era; the rise of neoliberalism and its consequences; and what led to the revival of economic studies. We also talk about a recent expansion in our understanding of the dynamics of inequality, with race and gender inequality. Finally, we discuss Dr. Milanović’s goals with this book.
