RECORDED ON MARCH 2nd 2021.  
Dr. Ilana Redstone is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Redstone's work has focused on legal permanent residents to the United States. Using a quantitative analytic approach, she has addressed questions surrounding a variety of dimensions of immigrant adaptation to the U.S. She has also written on the discipline of Sociology and the divisions therein. Dr. Redstone's current work focuses on campus climate and viewpoint diversity. She is the author of Unassailable Ideas: How Unwritten Rules and Social Media Shape Discourse in American Higher Education.

In this episode, we talk about Unassailable Ideas. We start with the thesis of the book, and discuss some statistics. Other topics include: cancel culture; where these ideas stem from; the role of universities; how these ideas move from campus to politics and the general public; how social media exacerbate the problem; research; and viewpoint diversity. Finally, we ask if the SJWs could be (morally) right, and discuss some of the best solutions to these issues.
