Dr. Garett Jones is Associate Professor of Economics and BB&T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at the Mercatus Center, at George Mason University. His research interests include macroeconomics, monetary economics, and the microfoundations of economic growth. His work has appeared in journals such as the Journal of Monetary Economics, the Journal of Economic Growth, and Critical Review. His first book, published in 2015 by Stanford University Press, is entitled Hive Mind: How Your Nation's IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Jones’ book, Hive Mind. Topics include: the individual and collective benefits of higher national IQs; how IQ correlates with emotional and social skills; its effects in the political realm; how it relates to current immigration issues; and possible solutions to improve IQ in the countries that lack it the most.
