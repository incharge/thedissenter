RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th 2022.  
Dr. Jonathan Maynard is a Lecturer in International Politics at King's College London's Department of Political Economy. His research is primarily concerned with the role of ideology in collective political violence, especially in forms of violence against civilians such as genocides, mass atrocities and terrorism. He works more broadly on a range of subjects relating to ideology, international security, violent conflict and political extremism, and have secondary research interests in political and ethical theories of political violence and political speech, and on methodological debates in political theory and political science. He is the author of Ideology and Mass Killing: The Radicalized Security Politics of Genocides and Deadly Atrocities.

In this episode, we focus on Ideology and Mass Killing. We first define mass killings, and get into explanations presented on the media; what ideology is; how ideologies can influence political behavior; non-ideological explanations; and Dr. Maynard’s neo-ideological explanation. We discuss the “true believers”, and how non-believers can still be influenced; why mass killings take different forms; why they occur; the role played by ideological propaganda and hate speech; if threats are ever real; and if it is possible to predict and prevent mass killings.
