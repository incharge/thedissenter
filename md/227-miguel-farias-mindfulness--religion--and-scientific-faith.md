Dr. Miguel Farias is an Associate Professor at Coventry University, UK. His work explores the psychological impact of beliefs and spiritual practices, including meditation and pilgrimage. He is also interested in the biological roots of our beliefs and how we can change them. He’s the author of The Buddha Pill: Can Meditation Change You?.

In this episode, we focus on some of the main topics in Dr. Farias’ book, The Buddha Pill. We go through some of the main issues in the psychological research on the effects of yoga, meditation and mindfulness. We talk about studies done on inmates, and the relationship between meditation and violence, linking it to ritual and synchrony. Finally, we talk about the literature on the relationship between religious beliefs and stress and anxiety-reduction, and how people use all sorts of strategies to give meaning to their lives, including atheists and agnostics.
