RECORDED ON OCTOBER 3rd, 2019.  
Dr. Colin Allen is Distinguished Professor, and Director of Graduate Admissions in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Allen's main areas of research concern the philosophical foundations of cognitive science and neuroscience. He is particularly interested in the scientific study of cognition in nonhuman animals and computers, and he has published widely on topics in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of biology, and artificial intelligence.

In this episode, we explore some topics of the cognitive sciences and philosophy of mind. We start by discussing what is a mind, how minds evolved, and our wrong intuitions about minds. We then address the topic of cognition, and what it is about, and talk about cognitive ethology. We also discuss issues surrounding the massive modularity of mind proposal. We get into the role of philosophy in the modern intellectual environment. Finally, we talk about what is cognitively special about humans, and animal ethics.
