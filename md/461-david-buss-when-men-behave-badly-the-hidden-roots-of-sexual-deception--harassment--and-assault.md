RECORDED ON APRIL 20th 2021.  
Dr. David Buss is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. He’s one of the founders of the field of evolutionary psychology. His primary research focus is on strategies of human mating. He’s the author of many books, including The Evolution of Desire, and the first textbook in Evolutionary Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. His most recent book is When Men Behave Badly: The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception, Harassment, and Assault.

In this episode, we focus on When Men Behave Badly. We first discuss what sexual conflict is, from an evolutionary perspective, and the evolutionary roots of behaviors like sexual deception, harassment and assault. We refer to sociocultural perspectives about sexual conflict, and how they complement evolutionary psychology. Throughout the interview, we touch on rape, mate guarding behavior, and mate value discrepancies and their effects. We also talk about evolutionary mismatches in sexual conflict. We touch on possible evolutionary explanations for the #metoo movement and the incel movement. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to prevent sexual violence, and also ask if people can use evolutionary psychology to improve their relationship satisfaction.
