In this episode, we focus on psychoanalysis. We start with a history of psychoanalysis, and its theoretical bases. We talk about the importance of taking individual differences into account when studying human psychology. The clinical aspect of psychoanalysis, and comparing it to cognitive-behavioral therapy. We discuss what psychoanalysis gets wrong about the subconscious mind, repressed memories, and defense mechanisms. We talk about how psychoanalysts have been trying to force neuroscience into their preconceived theories. We address some of the most pressing issues in modern psychiatry. We finish by asking if it is possible to reconcile psychoanalysis with modern scientific psychology.
