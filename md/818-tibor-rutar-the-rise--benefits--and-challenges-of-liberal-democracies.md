Dr. Tibor Rutar is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, Researcher at the Center for the Study of Post-Socialist Societies in Maribor, and Researcher at the Research Center for Strategy and Governance at the University of Ljubljana. His last two books are Rational Choice and Democratic Government: A Sociological Approach (Routledge, 2021) and Capitalism for Realists: Virtues and Vices of the Modern Economy (Routledge, 2022).

This is our second talk. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/b5-tB-SrHyI

This time, we focus on Rational Choice and Democratic Government. We talk about how old democracies are. We define liberal democracy, and talk about political and civil rights. We discuss the rise of democracies, the recent “democratic recession”, and the 2008 economic crisis. We discuss how levels of democracy are evaluated. We get into rational choice theory, self-interest, and incentives. We discuss explanations for the rise and spread of democracy. We talk about voting behavior, and discuss how much we should worry about average voters being uninformed. We discuss how both market failure and government failure occur. We talk about where public choice analyses fail. We discuss if democracy contributes to peace. Finally, we discuss if Francis Fukuyama was right, and if we should expect liberal-democratic capitalist societies to be more successful than authoritarian state-capitalist societies.
