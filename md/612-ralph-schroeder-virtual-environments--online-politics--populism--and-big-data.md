RECORDED ON JANUARY 19th 2022.  
Dr. Ralph Schroeder is Professor in Social Science of the Internet at the Oxford Internet Institute.  Dr. Schroeder has interests in virtual environments, the social aspects of e-science, and the sociology of science and technology. He has written extensively about virtual reality technology. He is the author of several books, including Knowledge Machines: Digital Transformations of the Sciences and Humanities, and Social Theory After the Internet: Media, Technology, and Globalization.

In this episode, we talk about virtual environments, online politics, populism, and Big Data in the social sciences. We start by discussing if social interaction changes in virtual environments. We talk about selective exposure to online political content, and if that affects political behavior. We get into populism: is it a thin ideology? Is it on the rise? Finally, we discuss if Big Data is useful for the social sciences.
