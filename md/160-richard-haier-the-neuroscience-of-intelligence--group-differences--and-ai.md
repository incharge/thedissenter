Dr. Richard Haier is Professor Emeritus in the Pediatric Neurology Division of the School of Medicine at University of California, Irvine. He is also the editor-in-chief of the journal Intelligence since 2016. In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on "Mainstream Science on Intelligence," an editorial written by the American psychologist Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which summarized findings from intelligence research. His work on the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) with Rex Jung examines the neuroanatomy of intelligence based on neuro-imaging research. He’s also the author of the book “The Neuroscience of Intelligence” (2016).

In this episode, we talk about psychometrics and intelligence. First, Dr. Haier explains what psychometrics is about, and how and why we can reliably measure psychological traits. Then, we discuss what intelligence is, the relationship between general intelligence, the g factor and IQ; the limitations of IQ testing; the correlation between IQ and life outcomes; genetic and environmental factors in IQ. We also refer to the neuroscience of intelligence, and the aspects of the brain that go associated with IQ. We also get into controversial aspects of intelligence research, like sex differences and race differences. We finish up by talking about the differences between human general intelligence and artificial intelligence, and the impact that these systems might have in society.
