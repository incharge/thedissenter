RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 10th 2021.  
Dr. Andreas Elpidorou is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Louisville. He specializes in the philosophical study of the mind and has published extensively on the nature of emotions (especially, boredom), consciousness, and cognition. He is best known for his work on the function and value of boredom. He is the co-author of Consciousness and Physicalism: A Defense of a Research Program (Routledge, 2018), the co-editor of Philosophy of Mind and Phenomenology: Conceptual and Empirical Approaches (Routledge, 2016), and the author of the recent book, Propelled: How Boredom, Frustration, and Anticipation Lead us to the Good Life.

In this episode, we focus on Propelled, and talk about boredom, frustration and anticipation, from a philosophical perspective. To put things into perspective, we first talk about Robert Nozick’s experience machine, and what it tells us about the role of negative emotions. We then address boredom, frustration and anticipation, how they work, and their relationship with other mental phenomena, like the experience of time, preferences, envy, the IKEA effect, memory, and worldviews like optimism and pessimism. In the end, we talk about how people can learn to deal with these emotions.
