You can find my first episode with Dr. Stephen Sanderson (Sociology, Darwinian Conflict Theory, And Religion) here: https://youtu.be/EWFtlnK8Kik

In this episode, we go through some of the most foundational aspects of our human societies. We talk about psychological differences between men and women, and gender roles; marriage systems, and polygamy and monogamy; romantic love; parenthood, parental investment, and differential investment in sons or daughters; and also what is behind fertility rates, with focus on infant mortality and female empowerment.
