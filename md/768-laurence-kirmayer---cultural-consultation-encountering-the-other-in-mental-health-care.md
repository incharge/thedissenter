Dr. Laurence Kirmayer is James McGill Professor and Director of the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at McGill University, and editor-in-chief emeritus of Transcultural Psychiatry. He directs the Culture & Mental Health Research Unit at the Jewish General Hospital where he conducts research on the mental health of Aboriginal peoples, mental health services for immigrants and refugees, and the cultural basis of psychiatric theory and practice. For 2021-2023, he is the President of the Society for Psychological Anthropology. He is the editor of Cultural Consultation: Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care.

In this episode, we focus on Cultural Consultation. We first discuss what cultural psychiatry is, why cultural diversity is a challenge to mental health care, and the different approaches to addressing diversity in mental health services. We delve into the challenges faced by migrants; how gender and ethnicity interact with hierarchies of power, and why that matters in a clinical context; working with marginalized communities; and working in rural and remote communities. We talk about how “healers” can help with psychological issues, and the issues with psychological traits that are stigmatized in certain cultural contexts. Finally, we discuss if culture influences how mental disorders manifest themselves, and how the social sciences can contribute to psychiatry.
