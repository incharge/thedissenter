Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics.

Dr. Erez Yoeli is a research scientist at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, where he directs the Applied Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism: understanding how it works and how to promote it.

They are both authors of Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.

In this episode, we focus on Hidden Games. Topics include: aspects of human behavior that game theory explains; motives and incentives, and why we are oblivious to them; how learning shapes beliefs and tastes; rationality; spillovers; primary and secondary rewards; proximate vs ultimate analyses; the emic-etic distinction; Nash equilibrium; human cooperation; norms and punishment; why we process information according to game-theoretic principles; moral philosophy from a game-theoretic perspective; nudges; and beliefs, and where they come from.

Time Links:  
00:00 Intro  
00:53  What aspects of human behavior is game theory best suited to explain?  
03:08  Why are we so oblivious to the motives and incentives behind our behavior?  
05:40  How learning shapes beliefs and tastes  
14:27  Rationality, and functionality  
17:20  Spillovers  
20:34  Primary and secondary rewards  
26:53  Proximate vs. ultimate analyses  
29:02  The emic-etic distinction  
31:42  Does what people say matter?  
41:01  Nash equilibrium  
45:18  What sustains human cooperation  
48:09  Norm enforcement, and punishment  
1:00:09  Why does our brain process information according to game theory mechanisms? Are these evolved?  
1:06:10  Is moral philosophy simply emic?  
1:14:52  Can we use game theory to nudge people into making better choices and being more “moral”?  
1:20:02  What are beliefs, and where do they come from?
