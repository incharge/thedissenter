RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 14th 2023.  
Dr. Elmar Unnsteinsson is an Assistant Professor and Ad Astra Fellow at University College Dublin, School of Philosophy. He is also the Principal Investigator of two research projects funded by The Icelandic Research Fund, The Confused Intentions Project and Insincerity for Fragmented Minds, both based at UCD and University of Iceland, where he has a part-time position as a Research Scientist. Dr. Unnsteinsson works on topics in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, history of analytic philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of linguistics, and cognitive science. He is the author of Talking About: An Intentionalist Theory of Reference.

In this episode, we focus on Talking About. We discuss different theories of reference. We talk about Frege’s Curse, and identity confusion. We discuss the distinction between representational states and representational acts, and implicit beliefs. We talk about expressionist and intentionalist approaches to speaker meaning. Finally, we get into Dr. Unnsteinsson’s edenic intentionalism, and we talk about self-directed speech, and some challenges to his theory.
