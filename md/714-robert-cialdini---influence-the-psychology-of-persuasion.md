RECORDED ON AUGUST 29th 2022.  
Dr. Robert Cialdini is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Arizona State University. He has spent his entire career researching the science of influence, earning him an international reputation as an expert in the fields of persuasion, compliance and prosocial behavior. He is the author of Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, a New York Times No. 1 bestseller, now in its third edition with over 5 million copies sold worldwide, and in over 40 languages.

In this episode, focus on Influence. We talk a bit about the psychology of compliance, and go through the seven principles of persuasion: reciprocation, liking, social proof, authority, scarcity, commitment and consistency, and unity. We talk about how Dr. Cialdini got at these principles. We discuss if there could be more principles, if they apply in any social context, if any of them is more important than the others, and what their goals are. Finally, we talk about how to learn and apply the principles, and how we can protect ourselves from manipulation and deception.
