RECORDED ON OCTOBER 13th 2023.  
Dr. Liuba Papeo is a tenured researcher at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives "Marc Jeannerod" of Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), and Principal Investigator of the research program “THEMPO” funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant. She is a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience, with a M.Sc. Psychology. After her Ph.D. (2010, SISSA Trieste), she joined the Department of Psychology at Harvard University as a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow (2011-2013). She completed the postdoctoral research training at CIMeC, University of Trento (2013-2014). In 2015, she joined the CBC at University Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona funded by a Marie Curie Cofund program grant.

In this episode, we talk about social perception. We start by talking about what we pay attention to when we perceive other people, the kinds of information we get from faces, and facing-dyad perception. We discuss minimal social scenes, how we distinguish between interaction and non-interacting dyads, and how socially relevant spatial relations are represented visually. We talk about body-form and body-motion perception. We discuss how we represent social entities differently from their relations, and how we learn about the kind of relationship a particular dyad has. We talk about areas of the brain that process social information. Finally, we get into how we process information about nonhuman bipeds and quadrupeds.
