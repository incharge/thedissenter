RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 11th 2021.  
Dr. Tim Maudlin is Professor of Philosophy at New York University. Her has interests primarily focused in the foundations of physics, metaphysics, and logic. His books include Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity, Truth and Paradox and The Metaphysics Within Physics. He is a member of the Academie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences and the Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi). He has been a Guggenheim Fellow.

In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of physics and metaphysics. We start by presenting some of the questions asked in philosophy of physics. We then discuss quantum mechanics and string theory. We talk about the nature of time, and ask if time travel will ever be possible and if it even makes sense theoretically. Finally, we address the relationship between Physics and Metaphysics, and we discuss if philosophy has been making any progress.
