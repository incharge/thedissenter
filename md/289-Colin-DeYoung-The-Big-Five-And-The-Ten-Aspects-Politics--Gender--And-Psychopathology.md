RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 22nd, 2019.  
Dr. Colin DeYoung is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. In his research in personality psychology, he has examined the theoretical structure of personality and the biological basis of personality.

In this episode, we talk about the Big Five personality traits and their ten aspects. We first go through the ten aspects. We then talk about the personality traits of liberals and conservatives, and gender differences in personality. We discuss the behavioral genetics of personality, the neuroscience of it, and the changes in personality that occur across the lifespan. In the latter part of the conversation, Dr. DeYoung explains his Cybernetic Big Five Theory (CB5T), and a cybernetic theory of psychopathology. We also refer to the difficulties in the classification of mental disorders.
