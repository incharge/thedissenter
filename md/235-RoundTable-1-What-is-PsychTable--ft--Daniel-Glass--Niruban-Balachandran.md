Dr. Daniel Glass is a clinician and researcher in the disciplines of evolutionary and clinical psychology. He has published sixteen peer-reviewed scholarly articles in the fields of psychology, medicine, and evolutionary studies, on subjects ranging from human emotions to peer bullying/victimization to Alzheimer’s disease. He received his doctorate in clinical psychology from Suffolk University and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at a private practice in Connecticut. His dissertation is on the emotional processing function of dreaming.  
Mr. Niruban Balachandran was a winner of the World Bank's Innovation Challenge Prize and the International Society for Human Ethology's Linda Mealey Award. He is widely published in scholarly journals and print media, and is a frequently-invited speaker at international conferences. He is a Master of Public Administration (MPA) graduate of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, as well as a Bachelor of psychology graduate from Rutgers. He was also a member of the Harvard Behavioral Insights Group.  
They are both project co-leaders of PsychTable.

This is a new series that we are trying to start on my channel/podcast, which will be called “RoundTable”, and where we will be having conversations with people involving the theoretical foundations of PsychTable, including people that are working on different Evolved Psychological Adaptations (EPAs).

In this first episode, we talk about what PsychTable is about, and how it will be built. We discuss the criteria used to classify something as an EPA; the kinds of EPAs that would be considered (including cultural and group-level EPAs); who would be able to access it, and how the evidence would be weighted; and who would benefit from it, and in what ways. We also talk a bit about the relationship between psychological adaptations and mental modules.
