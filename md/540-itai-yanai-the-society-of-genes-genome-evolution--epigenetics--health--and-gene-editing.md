RECORDED ON JULY 20th 2021.  
Dr. Itai Yanai is Founding Director of the Institute for Computational Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. He is also a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at NYU. He does research on cancer, computational biology, developmental genetics, genomics, microbiome, systems biology, single-cell transcriptomics, gene expression atlas construction, genome evolution. He is the author of The Society of Genes.

In this episode, we focus on The Society of Genes. We first talk about the metaphor of the “selfish gene”. We ask if mutations really occur randomly. We get into the idea of “the society of genes”, and discuss how genes cooperate and compete with one another. We discuss pleiotropy and polygenic traits, and what they tell us about how genes work. We talk about the evolution of sex, and what we can learn about genetics by studying cancer. We discuss human genetic diversity, and how to deal with genetic ancestry in medicine. Finally, we talk about epigenetics, gene editing, and some unanswered questions in genetics.
