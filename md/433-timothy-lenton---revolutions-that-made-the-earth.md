RECORDED ON DECEMBER 7th 2020.  
Dr. Timothy Lenton is Professor of Climate Change and Earth System Science at the University of Exeter and Director of the Global Systems Institute. He has over 20 years of research experience in studying the Earth as a system, and developing and using models to understand its behavior. He is particularly interested in how life has reshaped the planet in the past, and what lessons we can draw from this as we proceed to reshape the planet now. These topics are covered in his books ‘Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction’ (OUP, 2016) and (with Andrew Watson) ’Revolutions that Made the Earth’ (OUP, 2011).

In this episode, we talk about Revolutions that Made the Earth. We go through topics like: the intimate relationship between geology and life; the origins of life (in hydrothermal vents); what Dr. Lenton, in the book, calls the “critical steps” model of life; multicellular and complex life; the evolution of social life; culture; what is special about humans; the development of agriculture, and its impact on the planet; the Anthropocene, and when it started; new revolutions in the future; and if life on Earth was inevitable.
