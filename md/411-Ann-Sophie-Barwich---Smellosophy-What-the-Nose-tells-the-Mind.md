RECORDED ON OCTOBER 20th 2020.  
Dr. Ann-Sophie Barwich is Assistant Professor of History and Philosophy of Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She is a cognitive scientist and empirical philosopher & historian of science, technology, and the senses. She divides her brain-time between the Department of History & Philosophy of Science and the Cognitive Science Program. Estimated begin of lab (EEG/Olfactometry) in early 2021. She’s the author of Smellosophy: What the Nose tells the Mind.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Barwich’s book, Smellosophy. We talk about the complexity behind the sense of smell, including the molecular complexity of the olfactory stimulus, receptor genes, its neuroscience, comparing smell with other senses, smell and memory, and smell and decision-making. In the second part of the talk, we deal with general questions in neuroscience and philosophy of mind (and philosophy of neuroscience), like functional localization, modularity of mind, qualia, mapping, and if we experience the real world. We also discuss interdisciplinarity in academia, and the relationship between science and philosophy nowadays.
