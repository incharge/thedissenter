Dr. Vlasta Sikimić is an Assistant Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Her research focus is on Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of AI, Empirical Philosophy, Logic, Science Policy, and Animal Ethics. More specifically, she works on data-driven approaches to optimization of scientific reasoning.

In this episode, we talk about the epistemology of science. We first get into epistemic attitudes, epistemic tolerance and authoritarianism, skepticism towards the scientific method, whether epistemic attitudes relate to politics, and whether the political views of scientists play a major role in their scientific decisions. We talk about scientific performance, epistemic efficiency, machine learning in grant reviews, and research funding. We discuss team structures, and optimal research team composition in science. We talk about the decision to stop investing in particular scientific projects. We discuss methods to study the social epistemology of science. Finally, we talk about the costs associated with trying to reduce all scientific production and communication to English, epistemic equity, and dissatisfaction of female and early-career researchers with the academic system.
