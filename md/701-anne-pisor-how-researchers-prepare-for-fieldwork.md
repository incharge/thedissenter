RECORDED ON OCTOBER 3rd 2022.  
Dr. Anne Pisor is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Washington State University. Her research interests include long-distance relationships and resource management, long-distance relationships and the downsides of climate change, and the evolution of human sociality.

In this episode, we talk about how anthropologists prepare for – and do – fieldwork. We go through the several stages, including the planning, the preparation, and the integration into the community. We get into specific issues regarding power dynamics, dealing with local politics, and moral questions. We talk about how they learn the social norms, and how they establish relationships with the locals. Finally, we discuss the importance of field research.
