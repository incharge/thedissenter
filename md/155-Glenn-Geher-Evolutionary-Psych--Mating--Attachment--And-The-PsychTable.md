Dr. Glenn Geher is Professor of Psychology at the State University of New York at New Paltz where he has been awarded SUNY Chancellor Awards for Excellence for both Teaching and Research. In addition to teaching various courses and directing the New Paltz Evolutionary Psychology Lab, Dr. Geher serves as founding director of the campus’ Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program. He is also credited as the founder of the NorthEastern Evolutionary Psychology Society (NEEPS). He has also published several books including Evolutionary Psychology 101, Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love, and Straightforward Statistics. In Darwin's Subterranean World: Evolution, Mind, and Mating Intelligence, his Psychology Today blog, Dr. Geher addresses various topics related to the human condition.

In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human mating, mating intelligence and the PsychTable, a periodic table of evolved psychological adaptations. We first go through the evolutionary bases of human mating, including the importance of sexual competition and sexual selection, and distinguishing between short-term and long-term strategies in both sexes. Then, we discuss Mating Intelligence and if it really varies independently of General Intelligence and IQ, and also attachment theory. Finally, we talk about the PychTable; the criteria for considering something an adaptation; some criticisms of Evolutionary Psychology (EP); and also the relationship between EP and Biology, and if in the future it could be the unifying framework for all of the branches of Psychology.
