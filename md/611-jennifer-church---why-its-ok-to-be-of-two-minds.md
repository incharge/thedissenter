RECORDED ON JANUARY 12th 2022.  
Dr. Jennifer Church is a Professor of Philosophy at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Her research addresses various topics in the philosophy of mind. She is the author of Possibilities of Perception (Oxford UP, 2013), and Why It’s OK to Be of Two Minds.

In this episode, we focus on Why It’s Ok to be of Two Minds. We talk about what it means to be of two minds; the positive effects of not eliminating the conflict; three different models of dealing with the conflict: a juggler model, an isometrics model, and a disruptor model; conflicts with past and future selves; when projecting fantasy into reality might become a problem; dealing with inner conflicts through laughter and surrealism; when being of two minds is a problem; and what philosophers might gain from being have to hold opposing views in their minds.
