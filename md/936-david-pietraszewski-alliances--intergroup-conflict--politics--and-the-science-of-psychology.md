RECORDED ON DECEMBER 11th 2023.  
Dr. David Pietraszewski is Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is an experimental psychologist who applies evolutionary theorizing to Social, Cognitive, and Developmental questions. He is particularly interested in characterizing the psychology of multi-agent conflict and cooperation ("coalitional psychology").

This is our second interview. You can watch the first one (Modularity of Mind, Coalitional Psychology, and Politics), here: https://youtu.be/5v1qKir4nKE

In this episode, we start by talking about alliance membership and race categorization. We discuss intergroup conflict, peace, and reconciliation from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about how the human mind represents social groups. We discuss what cognitive processes are. We talk about the free will debate. We discuss David Pinsof and Martie Haselton’s alliance theory of political belief systems. Finally, we talk about difference detecting mechanisms, and the influence they have on the science of psychology.
