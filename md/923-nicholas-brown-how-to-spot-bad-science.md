RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 15th 2023.  
Dr. Nicholas Brown is a Researcher at Linnaeus University, Sweden. He works on developing new research methods in psychology and on applying meta-scientific perspectives on psychology as a science.

In this episode, we start by discussing conceptual and methodological issues with positive psychology and the study of well-being, and go through critiques of Lyubomirsky’s “happiness pie”, and happiness surveys. We also address methodological flaws with studies on the link between genetics and well-being, sadness and color perception, and predicting heart disease from Twitter language. We then discuss where bad science stems from, and talk about incentives, issues with the publishing system, and how bad science goes unchecked. Finally, we talk about the idea of trusting the experts, and rules of thumb to evaluate scientific evidence.
