RECORDED ON JANUARY 5th 2024.  
Dr. Honorata Mazepus is Associate Professor in the Political Science Department at the University of Amsterdam. Her research topics include links between institutions and individuals; legitimacy; fairness; and post-communism.

In this episode, we start by discussing what democracy is, how we measure it, and some of its history. We talk about the election winner-loser gap and subjective wellbeing, and citizens’ support for democratic checks and balances. We discuss what civil society is, and its interplay with external actors. We talk about how political legitimacy is established, and what political capacity is. We get specifically into the European Union, and discuss its political legitimacy, respect for national sovereignty, and how it deals with public backlash. Finally, we talk about what drives public support for international humanitarian interventions.
