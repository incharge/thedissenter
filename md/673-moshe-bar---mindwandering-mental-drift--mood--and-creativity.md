He does research in Cognitive Neuroscience, Biological Psychiatry, NeuroImaging, and Learning and Memory.

In this episode, we focus on Mindwandering. Topics include: the default mode network; how thoughts get associated; good and bad types of mindwandering; the relationship between mindwandering and mental health, with the example of schizophrenia; associative thinking and preferences; what we mindwander about; our sense of self; inner speech; Dr. Bar’s work on visual cognition, and the driller vs. hairdryer experiment; the inevitability of expectations, and how to deal with them; first impressions about other people; the relationship between states of mind and personality; immersion (in the modern industrial world); and if it is possible to deliberately change states of mind.
