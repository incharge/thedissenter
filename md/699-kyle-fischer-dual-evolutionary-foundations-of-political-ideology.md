RECORDED ON AUGUST 4th 2022.  
Dr. Kyle Fischer has just finished his PhD in evolutionary political psychology at the University of Auckland.

In this episode, we talk about the evolutionary foundations of political ideology. We start by defining political ideology, and talking about how it has been traditionally studied. We discuss Dr. Fischer’s dual evolutionary foundations of political ideology model. We talk about what characterizes left-wing authoritarianism and right-wing authoritarianism. Finally, we discuss predictions derived from the dual foundations model.
