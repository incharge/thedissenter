RECORDED ON DECEMBER 12th 2022.  
Dr. Dean Buonomano is Professor of Neurobiology and Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. His research goal is to understand how neurons develop selective responses to temporal features such as duration, interval and order. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain's Flaws Shape our Lives, and Your Brain is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time.

In this episode, we talk about the neuroscience of timing. We start by discussing how to understand time from the perspective of neuroscience, and how the brain processes time. We talk about factors that influence our perception of time, when it comes to duration, interval, and order. We discuss the relationship between neural time and subjective time, how the brain encodes neural time in patterns of neural activity, and if there are brain regions specialized in time processing. We talk about the interaction between timing and the sensory systems, and timing as an intrinsic property of neural networks. We discuss the relationship between neural time and the physical nature of time. Finally, we talk about what a mental clock is.
