RECORDED ON APRIL 29th 2021.  
Dr. Michelle Montague is Professor of Philosophy at The University of Texas at Austin. She is interested in philosophy of mind and metaphysics. Dr. Montague is the editor of Non-Propositional Intentionality, Cognitive Phenomenology, and Philosophical Writings by P.F. Strawson (co-edited with Galen Strawson). She is the author of The Given: experience and its content.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, with a focus on The Given. We go through several different concepts, like mental content, intentionality, and phenomenology. We discuss cognition, perception and sensory experience, and the relationship between them. We talk about the nature of consciousness. And we discuss the relationship between mind and metaphysics, the metaphysics of mental phenomena, the access we have to reality, and the metaphysical nature of reality.
