Dr. Michelle Scalise Sugiyama is Senior Instructor at the University of Oregon Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences, and an affiliate of the University of Oregon Anthropology Department. She is an evolutionary psychologist/anthropologist who specializes in symbolic and aesthetic behavior, with an emphasis on storytelling, art, and play. Her work investigates the origins of these behaviors—specifically, the selection pressures that led to their emergence, the role they played in ancestral human societies, and the design features of the mind that make them possible. She publishes in both scientific and humanities journals, and blogs for the Huffington Post, where she explores modern issues, trends, and behaviors in light of human evolutionary history.

In this episode, we talk about storytelling and folklore from an evolutionary perspective. We start off by talking about the social role and the evolutionary bases of storytelling. We then look into some of the similarities in themes and characters across cultures. We discuss if storytelling might play a role in the development of theory of mind in children. We also talk about the role of play in children’s development. And we end up talking about some of the similarities between oral storytelling and fictional literature, and the fact that storytelling still plays a big role in modern societies.
