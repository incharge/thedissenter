RECORDED ON MARCH 4th 2024.  
Dr. Charles Roseman is an Associate Professor of evolution, ecology and behavior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He studies the evolution of complex traits.

In this episode, we first talk about complex traits and how we study their evolution, and we talk about adaptations, by-products, phenotypic plasticity, and genetic drift. We discuss the limitations of adaptationism. We talk about the example of the evolution of the cranium in hominins, and hybridization in human evolution. We then discuss group differences, the debate between the hereditarians and the anti-hereditarians, and questions surrounding differences in intelligence and IQ, and the concept of race. We also talk about issues with mechanistic explanations for the anti-hereditarian position, and the role of genes in group differences. We discuss the factors that play a role in variation in body form among human groups, and how developmental processes shape evolution. Finally, we talk about Drs. Roseman and Ocobock’s Scientific American article, “To Understand Sex, We Need to Ask the Right Questions”.
