In this episode, we focus on Ideological Fixation. We start by addressing the premise of the book, and the current relevance of understanding ideology. We talk about ideology and its psychological foundations. We discuss what truth is, and the postmodernist challenge. We talk about the conflict between religion and science, and go through ideologies like liberalism, socialism, and fascism. We also discuss the ideological conflict between the “West” and the “Rest”, the biggest debates in contemporary liberal democracies, and the “culture wars”. We talk about intellectuals as the source of most ideologies. Finally, we discuss if having an ideology is something bad, how to best understand how ideologies develop, and if there are solutions for the current ideological conflicts.
