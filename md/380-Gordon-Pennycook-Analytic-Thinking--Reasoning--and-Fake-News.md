RECORDED ON JULY 22nd, 2020.  
Dr. Gordon Pennycook is Assistant Professor of Behavioural Science at University of Regina’s Hill/Levene Schools of Business. He’s also an Associate Member of the Department of Psychology. He’s a member of the editorial board for Thinking & Reasoning and a consulting editor for Judgment and Decision Making. His research focus is on reasoning and decision-making, broadly defined. He investigates the distinction between intuitive processes (“gut feelings”) and more deliberative (“analytic”) reasoning processes and is principally interested in the causes (a) and consequences (b) of analytic thinking. Dr. Pennycook has published on religious belief, sleep paralysis, morality, creativity, smartphone use, health beliefs (e.g., homeopathy), language use among climate change deniers, pseudo-profound bullshit, delusional ideation, fake news (and disinformation more broadly), political ideology, and science beliefs. He’s also interested in the methodological and theoretical issues that pertain to the measurement of cognitive reflection and motivated reasoning.

In this episode, we first talk about dual-process theory, reasoning and rationality, motivated reasoning, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and the analytic cognitive style and ability. We then go through what characterizes pseudo-profound bullshit in terms of discourse, the language of climate change deniers, and fake news and misinformation (particularly on the internet).
