Dr. Patrick McNamara is an Associate Professor of Neurology in the Department of Neurology at the BU School of Medicine and Professor of Psychology at National University, and Director of the Cognitive Neuroscience of Religion Project, along with Dr. Jordan Grafman. Upon graduating from the Behavioral Neuroscience Program at Boston University in 1991, he trained at the Aphasia Research Center at the Boston VA Medical Center in neurolinguistics and brain-cognitive correlation techniques. He then began developing an evolutionary approach to problems of brain and behavior and currently is studying the evolution of the frontal lobes, the evolution of the two mammalian sleep states (REM and NREM) and the evolution of religion in human cultures. He is the author of The Cognitive Neuroscience of Religious Experience: Decentering and the Self.

In this episode, we focus on The Cognitive Neuroscience of Religious Experience. We start by talking about the use of neuroscience in the study of religion, the evolution of religion, its role in gene-culture coevolution, and religion as a transformational technology. We then go through decentering, the divided self, the cognitive mechanisms and brain conditions that give rise to religiosity, psychedelics, mystical experiences, supernatural agents, rituals, and the relationship between language and religion.
