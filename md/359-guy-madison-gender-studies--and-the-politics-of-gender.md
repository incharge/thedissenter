RECORDED ON JUNE 11th, 2020.  
Dr. Guy Madison is Professor at the Department of Psychology at University of Umeå, Sweden. Dr. Madison does research in Neuroscience, Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. 

This is my second talk with Dr. Guy Madison, where we talk about gender studies and the politics of gender. We refer to gender studies and the impact they have on academia in general. We get into Swedish politicians’ arguments for gender quotas, and ask if they really solve any issues, and what they are really about (power and influence rather than quality and productivity). Finally, we talk about the gender equality paradox, and how to improve the quality of gender studies.
