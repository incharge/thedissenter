William Costello finished his MSc in Psychology: Culture and Evolution at Brunel University London in 2021. The topic of his thesis was incels. Later this year he will join Dr. David Buss's Evolutionary Psychology lab at the University of Texas at Austin, as a PhD student. He will retain an honorary research assistant role at Swansea University. He writes opinion pieces on a range of cultural issues including gender and identity politics, and his work has been featured in Quillette and Areo, and his academic research has been presented at several academic conferences around the world.

In this episode, we talk about the psychology of incels, and modern mating. We first define incels, and go through their psychological traits. We talk about their mental wellbeing, and their self-perceptions of their own mate value. We discuss possible psychotherapeutic approaches, and singlehood. We talk about how people should view incels, misrepresentations in the media, and the advice they get online. We then get into some issues with modern mating, how it is hard for both men and women, and potential solutions.
