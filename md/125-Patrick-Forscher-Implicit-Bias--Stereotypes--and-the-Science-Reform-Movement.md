Dr. Patrick Forscher is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the J. William Fulbright College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Arkansas. He studies social disparities and what to do about them. He also has a strong interest in research methods. As such, he has used a wide variety of methods to pursue his research interests, including scale construction, meta-analysis, field research, and conventional laboratory studies.  
In this episode, we talk about implicit biases, stereotypes, and prejudice. We start by discussing the scientific validity of the concept of “implicit bias”; the issue with distinguishing implicit bias, explicit bias, and overt behavior; how stereotypes affect people’s behavior; some interesting approaches to changing people’s stereotypes, and prevent discriminatory behavior. In the final segment of the interview, we also discuss the science reform movement, and some of the reasons behind the replicability crisis in science.
