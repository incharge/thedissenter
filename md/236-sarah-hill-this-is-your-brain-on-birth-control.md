RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 12th, 2019.  
SORRY ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH THE VIDEO QUALITY. THE CONNECTION WAS A BIT WEAK.  
Dr. Sarah Hill is Associate Professor of Psychology at Texas Christian University. She studies a range of topics, applying an evolutionary lens, including the interplay between immune function and mating strategies; the impact of inflammation; poverty, food regulation, and weight gain; hormonal contraceptives and mate choice; and other topics under the rubric of life history theory. She is just about to release a book, This Is Your Brain on Birth Control: The Surprising Science of Women, Hormones, and the Law of Unintended Consequences.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Hill’s upcoming book, This is Your Brain on Birth Control, and go through some of its main topics, like: how women’s behavior changes through their menstrual cycles, and the ovulatory-shift hypothesis; concealed ovulation; the different types of birth control, and their effects on women and people around them. We also talk about why studying biological sex differences is important and is not dangerous at all, the ways the pill empowered women, and also how it might have changed the dynamics in the mating market, including their effects on men.
