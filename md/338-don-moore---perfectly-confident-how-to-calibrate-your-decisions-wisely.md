RECORDED ON April 8th, 2020.  
Dr. Don Moore is the Lorraine Tyson Mitchell Professor of Communication and Leadership at the Haas School of Business, and a member of the Management of Organizations group, at UC Berkeley. Prior to Haas, Dr. Moore served on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, where he held the Carnegie Bosch chair. His research interests focus on overconfidence, including when people think they’re better than they are, when they think they are better than others, and when they are too sure they know the truth. He’s the author of a new book, Perfectly Confident: How To Calibrate Your Decisions Wisely.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Moore’s new book, and talk about confidence, overconfidence, and underconfidence. We also refer to the above-average effect, ambiguity aversion and risk aversion, overprecision, and the different kinds of overconfidence and underconfidence. Finally, we discuss the relationship between confidence and decision-making and emotions, and the ways by which we can try to calibrate our decisions wisely, applying it to business, politics, and personal relationships.
