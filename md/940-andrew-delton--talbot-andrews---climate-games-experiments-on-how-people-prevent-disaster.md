RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2024.  
Dr. Andrew Delton is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science, the Center for Behavioral Political Economy, and the College of Business at Stony Brook University.   
Dr. Talbot Andrews is Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Connecticut. Her research focuses on how institutions, public policy, and the physical environment shape preferences and behavior related to climate change.  
They are both authors of Climate Games: Experiments on How People Prevent Disaster.

In this episode, we focus on Climate Games. We first talk about the challenges of climate change, and the best solutions we have for it. We discuss why climate change is a “global social dilemma”, and how we can use economic games, like the disaster game, to study how people make decisions that are relevant to climate change. We talk about how people react to different kinds of technology, to what extent they are willing to help other groups of people and avoid disaster for others, and the relationship between leaders and citizens. We also talk about how we can study inequality through disaster games. Finally, we discuss whether we can be optimistic about tackling climate change.
