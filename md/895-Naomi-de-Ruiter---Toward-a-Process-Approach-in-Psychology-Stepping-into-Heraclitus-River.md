RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2023.  
Dr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Groningen. In her current research, she is inspired by critical psychology and discursive psychology in her attempt to study the ontology or process mechanisms of self and identity (and related concepts) as situated in time and context. In much of her research, she adopts a complex dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic or theoretical work. She is the author, together with Paul van Geert, of Toward a Process Approach in Psychology: Stepping into Heraclitus' River.

In this episode, we focus on Toward a Process Approach in Psychology. We talk about the dominant substance ontology approach in psychology, and an alternative process approach. We discuss dynamical systems theory, and how science is done. We talk about the study of self-esteem. We discuss the use of “representative samples”; intervention causality, and randomized controlled trials; the measurement problem in psychology; and how to deal with variability. Finally, we talk about how a process approach can reframe the way we think about the replication crisis in psychology.
