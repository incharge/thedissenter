RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 6th 2021.  
Dr Hans-Georg Moeller is a professor in the Philosophy and Religious Studies Programme at the University of Macau. His research focuses on Chinese and Comparative Philosophy (specifically Daoism) and on Social and Political Thought (specifically Social Systems Theory). He is the author of several books, including The Moral Fool: A Case for Amorality.

In this episode, we focus on The Moral Fool. We start by talk about morality as a tool, and the uses and abuses of morality. We discuss the concept of the “moral fool”, and what amorality is. We talk about moral responsibility, and the moral character of systems of law. We discuss moral relativism and moral nihilism. We talk about the case of religion, and ask if it is especially problematic. We discuss if there is ever any moral progress. We discuss the role moral philosophers play in society, if any. Finally, we also talk about the relationship between science and ethics, and if something could replace ethics.
