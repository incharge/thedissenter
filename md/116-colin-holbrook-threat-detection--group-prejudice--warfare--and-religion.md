Dr. Colin Holbrook is Assistant Professor of Cognitive and Information Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He researches decision-making under contexts of threat, with particular focus on political orientation, group prejudice, and the representation of mental states.

In this episode, we talk about threat detection; the relationship between threat and fight-or-flight responses; how threat instigates group prejudice; threat in the context of politics and warfare; religion and social cohesion; and the hyperactive agency detection device.
