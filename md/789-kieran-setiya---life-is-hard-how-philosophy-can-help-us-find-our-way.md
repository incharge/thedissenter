RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 17th 2023.  
Dr. Kieran Setiya is Professor of Philosophy at MIT. He works mainly in ethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind. He is the author of Practical Knowledge, Reasons without Rationalism, Knowing Right From Wrong, and, more recently, Life Is Hard: How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way.

In this episode, we focus on Life Is Hard. We start by discussing the purpose of philosophy. We talk about what makes life hard, and we discuss if we should avoid hardship; complaining about hardship, and pitying other people; and what a life well lived is. We get into topics like physical disability and pain; loneliness; friendship; loss and grief; Stoicism; being a “failure”, and what “success” means; injustice; and the meaning of life. Finally, we discuss if argumentation can change people’s views on life.
