RECORDED ON JUNE 13th 2023.  
Dr. Coralie Chevallier is a Researcher in the evolution and social cognition group, at the Cognitive Science Department of the École Normale Superieure – PSL. She is a behavioral scientist studying the evolutionary and cognitive determinants of social cognition. She has mainly focused on the way motivational factors affect people’s social behaviors.

In this episode, we talk about individual differences in social cognition. We start by discussing what they are, and how they are studied, including behavioral tasks and surveys. We discuss how statistical “noise” can be meaningful. We talk about the psychological effects of living in harsh and unpredictable environments in the domains of cooperation and trust, health issues, political attitudes, and parental investment. We discuss how we can reframe the way we think about the psychology and behavior of people living in harsh environments. We talk about how cognitive science can contribute to climate change mitigation. Finally, we discuss what studying social cognition can teach us about reducing inequalities in higher education.
