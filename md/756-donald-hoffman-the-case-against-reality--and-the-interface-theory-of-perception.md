RECORDED ON DECEMBER 1st 2022.  
Dr. Donald Hoffman is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Hoffman studies consciousness, visual perception and evolutionary psychology using mathematical models and psychophysical experiments. He is the author of The Case Against Reality: Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.

In this episode, we focus on The Case Against Reality, and the interface theory of perception. We start by discussing the interface theory of perception, shape as an effective code for fitness, different ways of perceiving “reality”, and what is “real”. We address scientific and philosophical objections to the theory, and epistemological approaches that might differ from empirical science. We talk about simulated realities, and discuss if they are really different from what we normally perceive. We talk about the use of psychedelics; and spirits, ghosts, and gods as experiences. We ask if “truth-seeing” organisms could evolve, and if we could ever perceive objective reality. Finally, we talk about breaking the tension between science and spiritual and religious traditions.
