Dr. Carin Perilloux is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Southwestern University, US. She uses cognitive science to study social phenomena from an evolutionary perspective. In particular, she applies an adaptationist lens to human mating. Her main research interests include sexual intent perception, physical attractiveness, sexual victimization and parent-offspring conflict.

In this episode, we focus on particular aspects of human mating, including sexual intent perception, cues of physical attractiveness for both sexes, how women deal with their vulnerability to sexual abuse and rape, and also parent-offspring conflict when it comes to mate selection.
