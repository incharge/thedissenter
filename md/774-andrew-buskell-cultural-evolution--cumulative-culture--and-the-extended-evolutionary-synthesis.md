RECORDED ON JANUARY 5th 2023.  
Dr. Andrew Buskell is a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Public Policy. His work analyses issues where human cognition, culture, politics, and biology intersect. His current project examines the ontological and epistemic assumptions underwriting cross-cultural comparison and their implications for research and policy design. He is one of the co-organizers of the project ‘Culture at the Macro-Scale: Boundaries, Barriers, and Endogenous Change‘.

In this episode, we talk about cultural evolution. We start by discussing what cultural evolution is, when it started, and its elements. We talk about a systems approach to cultural evolution. We talk about cognitive novelties and how they arise. We discuss cumulative culture, its different types (adaptiveness, complexity, efficiency, and disparity), and the paradigmatic example of complex hominin technologies. We talk about cultural groups, and demographic cultures. We discuss Kim Sterelny’s and Wengrow’s and Graeber’s accounts of the origins of hierarchy and inequality. We ask if we need an extended evolutionary synthesis. Finally, we talk about uniqueness in the life sciences.
