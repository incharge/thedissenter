RECORDED ON MARCH 31st 2023.  
Dr. Belén López-Pérez is a Lecturer in Psychology at The University of Manchester. She concluded her PhD in Social psychology at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in 2012, and her Postdoctoral research in Social and Developmental Psychology in the School of Psychology at Plymouth University. Her research interests include empathy and interpersonal emotion regulation across the lifespan, as well as happiness and well-being.

In this episode, we focus on emotion regulation, emotion goals, happiness, and empathy. We first talk about intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation, the relationship between interpersonal emotion regulation and social competence, cross-cultural differences in emotion regulation, and the development of emotion regulation. We discuss emotionality and academic functioning, and we discuss emotion goals and well-being. We talk about children’s political knowledge. We discuss conceptualizations of happiness, how they vary, and their applications. We delve into interpersonal affect worsening during the COVID-19 pandemic, and children’s socio-emotional development. Finally, we discuss the relationship between theory of mind and empathy.
