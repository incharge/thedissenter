Dr. Peter Adamson is Professor of Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and at King's College London. He has written articles, monographs and edited books, mostly on philosophy in the Islamic world and ancient philosophy. He is the host of the weekly podcast "History of Philosophy without any gaps", which by 2014 had more than four million downloads and led to the publication of a book series. He received the Philip Leverhulme Prize in 2003, for "outstanding research achievements of young scholars of distinction and promise based in UK institutions" and received a grant from the same institution in 2010.

In this episode, we talk about the origins of philosophy, and the Pre-Socratics. We first discuss what we should consider to be “philosophy” and where it might have started, and we also refer to the relationship between religion and philosophy. We then get into the Pre-Socratics, and what distinguished them from the others. We also talk about the sophists and the ancient poets, before ending with a discussion about the relationship between philosophy and (modern) science.
