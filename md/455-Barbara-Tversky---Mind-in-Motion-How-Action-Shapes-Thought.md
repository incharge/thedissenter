RECORDED ON JANUARY 29th 2021.  
Dr. Barbara Tversky is a Professor Emerita of Psychology at Stanford University and a Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Dr. Tversky specializes in cognitive psychology. She is an authority in the areas of visual-spatial reasoning and collaborative cognition. Dr. Tversky’s research interests include language and communication, comprehension of events and narratives, and the mapping and modeling of cognitive processes. She is the author of Mind in Motion: How Action Shapes Thought.

In this episode, we focus on Mind in Motion. We start with the concept of cognitive map. We discuss embodied cognition. We then talk about gestures, and how they aid communication and learning. Other topics include: the relationship between the how we perceive space and how we perceive time, and between space and how we think about our social environments; how we move from the way we perceive the world to concepts and abstractions; how to improve learning, and using virtual and augmented reality; and creativity.
