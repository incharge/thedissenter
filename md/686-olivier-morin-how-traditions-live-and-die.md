RECORDED ON JULY 25th 2022.  
Dr. Olivier Morin has a full-time tenured research position at the Institut Jean Nicod in Paris. He is also a Research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology in Jena, with the Minds and Traditions Research Group. His work focuses on cultural transmission and touches on the relations between anthropology, psychology and the philosophy of social science. He is the author of How Traditions Live and Die.

In this episode, we focus on How Traditions Live and Die. We first define “tradition” and “culture”. We talk about theories of cultural transmission, like memetics, and forms of cultural transmission, like imitation, learning, communication, teaching, and social influence. We discuss the Theory of Diffusion Chains, and what makes for cultural success. We talk about transmission within and between generations. We discuss the evolution of human culture, and why culture is rare in the animal kingdom. We also talk about human nature, and ask if there could be human societies without culture.
