RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 8th 2023.  
Dr. Jean-Manuel Roubineau is a Professor of Ancient History at Université Rennes 2. He is a classics scholar who specializes in Greek antiquity, the historical anthropology of sport, and the history of social inequalities. He is the author of The Dangerous Life and Ideas of Diogenes the Cynic.

In this episode, we focus on The Dangerous Life and Ideas of Diogenes the Cynic. We start by talking about the Mediterranean world of the 4th century BCE, and the life of Diogenes. We then go through his philosophy, and topics like cosmopolitanism, cultural relativism, and questioning norms; the fact of poverty and the feeling of poverty; being a mendicant philosopher; his jar as a symbol; slavery and freedom; pleasure, diet, and sex; exercise and health; speaking one’s mind freely; his supposed encounter with Alexander the Great; his ideas about Socrates and Plato; and his death. Finally, we discuss which philosophers were influenced by Diogenes, Stoicism, and his legacy.
