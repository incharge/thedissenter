RECORDED ON AUGUST 25th 2020.  
Dr. Brian Hare is a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. He researches the evolution of cognition by studying both humans, our close relatives the primates (especially bonobos and chimpanzees), and species whose cognition converged with our own (primarily domestic dogs). He founded and co-directs the Duke Canine Cognition Center. He’s the author of several books, including the most recent one, Survival of the Friendliest: Understanding Our Origins and Rediscovering Our Common Humanity.

In this episode, we talk about his book, Survival of the Friendliest. First, we go through some of the psychological mechanism that allow for our friendliness, and later we also refer to empathy, self-control, and theory of mind. We discuss the process of self-domestication. We also talk about simianization, Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and ways to increase our friendliness toward out-groups.
