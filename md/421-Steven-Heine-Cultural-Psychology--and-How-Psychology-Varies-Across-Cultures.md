RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th 2020.  
Dr. Steven J. Heine is Distinguished University Scholar and Professor of Social and Cultural Psychology at the University of British Columbia. Heine’s pioneering research has challenged key psychological assumptions in self-esteem, meaning, and the ways that people understand genetic constructs. He is the author of many acclaimed journal articles and books in the fields of social and cultural psychology including Cultural Psychology, the top-selling textbook in the field. In 2016, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

In this episode, we talk about Cultural Psychology. We start with some basic questions, regarding the field of cultural psychology, and what is culture. We then go through several topics like: where does cultural variation come from?; ways of classifying different cultures; differences in psychological mechanisms influenced by culture, and if these are permanent; a sensitive period for acculturation; and how cultures have changed over time. We talk about specific psychological mechanisms whose universality has recently been questioned, including: the endowment effect; the similarity-attraction effect; overconfidence; cognitive dissonance; the fundamental attribution error; and how people experience mental illness. Toward the end we also discuss how ideas spread in societies, and I ask Dr. Heine what are some of the most interesting questions that Cultural Psychology has yet to answer.
