RECORDED ON APRIL 9th 2024.  
Dr. Matti Häyry is Professor of Philosophy at Aalto University School of Business, Finland. Dr. Häyry’s main fields of interest have been moral and political philosophy and philosophical bioethics. His practical topics in bioethics have ranged from abortion, euthanasia, and resource allocation to genetics, systems biology, and synthetic biology. Theoretically, his work has centered on the main normative doctrines of European moral and political philosophy. He is the co-author of Antinatalism, Extinction, and the End of Procreative Self-Corruption.

In this episode, we focus on Antinatalism, Extinction, and the End of Procreative Self-Corruption. We start by talking about the history of antinatalism in the Western tradition, from ancient Greece to Christianity, and the past 300 years. We discuss other “isms” associated with antinatalism, and we focus on extinctionism. We talk about what constitutes a good life, and arguments against reproduction. We discuss the most popular current arguments for antinatalism, and Dr. Häyry’s alternative argument. Finally, we explore the possible routes to an antinatalist society.
