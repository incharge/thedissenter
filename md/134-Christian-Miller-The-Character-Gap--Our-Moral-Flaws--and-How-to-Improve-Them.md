In this episode, our conversation focuses on Dr. Miller’s book, The Character Gap. We talk about moral realism, and alternative approaches to morality. We also refer to some psychological experiments that reveal our moral flaws, and how we can improve them. We also discuss utilitarianism and the effective altruism movement.
