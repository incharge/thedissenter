RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th 2023.  
Dr. Tibor Rutar is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, Researcher at the Center for the Study of Post-Socialist Societies in Maribor, and Researcher at the Research Center for Strategy and Governance at the University of Ljubljana. His scholarly work is currently focused on political, economic and historical sociology, particularly longstanding social issues related to democracy and capitalism. His lastest book is Capitalism for Realists: Virtues and Vices of the Modern Economy (Routledge, 2022).

In this episode, we focus on Capitalism for Realists. We start by defining capitalism, and talk about people’s current views on capitalism and socialism. We discuss what Marx got wrong about capitalism, Marxist and libertarian perspectives, and Dr. Rutar’s approach. We talk about different explanations for the origins of capitalism, from Weber, Henrich, and Mokyr; an alternative explanation for its development in 15th and 16th-century England; and we also address explanations based on cultural superiority. We get into topics like market exploitation and the minimum wage; the relationship between capitalism and poverty; economic inequality; the term “neoliberalism”; and claims about the moral effects of markets. Finally, we talk about climate change, and discuss if it is caused by capitalism.
