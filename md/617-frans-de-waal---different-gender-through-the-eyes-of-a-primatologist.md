RECORDED ON APRIL 18th 2022.  
Dr. Frans de Waal is a Dutch primatologist and ethologist. He is Emeritus Candler Professor at Emory University, and Emeritus Professor at the University of Utrecht, and author of numerous books including Chimpanzee Politics, The Bonobo and the Atheist, Mamma’s Last Hug, and, more recently, Different: Gender Through the Eyes of a Primatologist.

In this episode, we focus on Different. We first ask where behavioral sex differences come from, and how we compare to other great Apes. We discuss self-socialization. We talk about prejudices regarding gender. We tackle assumptions about ancestral human violence, alpha males (and alpha females), females having multiple partners, the male sex drive, the female orgasm, and forced copulation. We talk about aspects of human social organization, like male bonding, female bonding, and nuclear families. We discuss human paternal investment. We talk about potential issues with ignoring and exacerbating behavioral sex differences. Finally, Dr. de Waal gives us a summary of how to think about behavioral sex differences.
