RECORDED ON AUGUST 20th 2021.  
Dr. Thomas K. Metzinger is senior research professor at the department of philosophy at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany. From 2014-2019 he was a Fellow at the Gutenberg Research College. He is the founder and director of the MIND group and Adjunct Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies, Germany. His research centers on analytic philosophy of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind, and AI. We start with consciousness, and ask what is the best way of approaching the study of consciousness, and discuss pure consciousness, and the minimal model of explanation for consciousness. We also talk about what we can learn from disruptions of consciousness, and if other animals also have consciousness. We talk about panpsychism and solipsism. We discuss the self-model theory of subjectivity, and the “self”. Finally, we discuss the some of the most pressing issues in the ethics of AI, and artificial consciousness.
