RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th 2023.  
Dr. Hanno Sauer is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Utrecht University. His main research interests are in moral psychology and empirically informed metaethics. He is interested in whether and how we can bring empirical data from diverse disciplines such as social psychology, neuroscience or cognitive science to bear on questions of normative and/or metaethical interests, and what the limits of this approach are. His latest book is Moral Teleology: A Theory of Progress.

In this episode, we focus on Moral Teleology. We start by discussing what moral progress is, if it is possible, and we get into a moral anti-realist account of moral progress. We talk about how we can naturalize teleology. We discuss moral regress, and reactionary conservatism. Finally, we talk about institutions of moral progress, and what causes it.
