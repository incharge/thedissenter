In this episode we cover mating systems in humans (monogamy, polygamy), jealousy, why women have affairs, sexual double standards, stalking, workplace harassment, women’s defenses against sexual coercion, and the (positive) effects of online pornography, sex dolls and virtual-reality sex in mating strategies and sexual violence.
