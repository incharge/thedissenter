Samuel Andreyev is a Canadian music composer and writer residing in France. He also has a YouTube channel with his name.  
This is my third interview with him, so please go check out the first two.  
First interview, “Music Across Times and Cultures”: https://youtu.be/9UENs9ia6Zo  
Second interview, “Philosophy of Music and Art”: https://youtu.be/HUiV4Hgw924

In this episode, we talk about aesthetic and artistic tastes and preferences, and their innate and acquired aspects. We also refer to the issues with trying to find patterns in music from different times and cultures that might be universal and biologically based. 

Time Links:  
01:12  Are aesthetic and artistic preferences innate or acquired?  
04:09  Biological and physiological constraints                           
09:08  The relationship between musical sounds and natural sounds        
13:51  Is there a “savannah hypothesis” for the evolutionary bases of music?                
18:38  Social influences              
28:54  The issues with finding patterns of musical tastes in different times and cultures                   
41:28  Modernism, and the issue with classifying something as “ugly” or “beautiful”               
52:20  As an artist, is there peer pressure to conform to certain standards?
