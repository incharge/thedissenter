RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 22nd 2022.  
Dr. Robert Pennock is University Distinguished Professor at Michigan State University, where he is on the faculty of Lyman Briggs College, the Departments of Philosophy and Computer Science & Engineering, and the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior program. His research involves empirical and philosophical questions that relate to evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and the scientific character, such as the evolution of altruism, complexity, and intelligence. He is the author of books like An Instinct for Truth: Curiosity and the Moral Character of Science.

In this episode, we focus on An Instinct for Truth. We go through some of the traits that characterize (or should characterize) scientists, like curiosity, honesty, skepticism, and intellectual humility. We talk about moral values that orient science, and the importance of failure. We discuss the scientific method, the demarcation problem, and pseudoscience. We talk about the relationship between science and ethics. Finally, we ask if science is a cultural construct.
