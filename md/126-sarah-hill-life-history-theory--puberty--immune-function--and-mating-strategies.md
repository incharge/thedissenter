Dr. Sarah Hill is Associate Professor of Psychology at Texas Christian University. She studies a range of topics, applying an evolutionary lens, including the interplay between immune function and mating strategies; the impact of inflammation; poverty, food regulation, and weight gain; hormonal contraceptives and mate choice; and other topics under the rubric of life history theory.  
In this episode, we talk about life history theory; how life history varies between species, and also how environmental cues might trigger fast or slow life history strategies. We talk about how it all starts in the uterus; the environmental cues people pay more attention to; how personality and other psychological traits might produce individual variation in dealing with the same cues. The we get into specific topics, like immune function; age of puberty onset; inflammation; eating habits and weight gain; how contraceptives affect women’s mating strategies; and also how technology like online porn, dating websites, and sex robots might tweak men’s mating strategies toward preferring short-term relationships.
