RECORDED ON April 16th, 2020.  
Dr. Melanie Meng Xue is assistant professor in the Social Science Division at New York University in Abu Dhabi. Her research lies at the intersection of economic history and political economy. She has studied the rise of gender-equitable beliefs and the deterioration of civil society in the context of imperial China. By tracing the impact of historical events over time and in various institutional settings, her work isolates the role of values, beliefs and norms in shaping economic and political disparities. Another strand of Dr. Meng Xue’s research concerns the decoding of folklore and mythology as a new approach to understanding historical values.

In this episode, we talk about how to study values, beliefs, and norms, and how they change over time, from a historical perspective. We go through the example of the history of China, and the transition from imperial China to communist China and State capitalist China, and we focus mostly on how gender beliefs changed over time.
