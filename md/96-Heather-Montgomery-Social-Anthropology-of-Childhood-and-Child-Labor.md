Dr. Heather Montgomery is a social anthropologist who studied for her PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge, which she wrote on child prostitution in Thailand. She has had jobs and research positions in Sussex, Norway, Texas and at Oxford. Her research interests are within Childhood Studies, especially the history and anthropology of childhood and children’s rights.

In this episode, we talk about what might be some cultural influences on childhood, and how boys and girls behave. We address the issue about how parents might look at their children as economic assets, and how that influences division of labor between the sexes, and child labor. We finish by talking a little bit about how people’s perceptions about children changed over time in the West, and some of the reason behind that change.
