Dr. Bradley Campbell is an Associate Professor of Sociology at California State University. He’s also the author of books like The Geometry of Genocide, and, more recently, The Rise of Victimhood Culture.  
In this episode, the conversation centers around the book The Rise of Victimhood Culture, co-authored with Jason Manning. We talk about the distinction between cultures of honor, cultures of dignity, and cultures of victimhood; the historical precedents of victimhood culture and the boom in 2013/2014; the religious aspects of victimhood culture; the influences from postmodernism and Marxist conflict theories; the problem within sociology; the role of moral status; the possibility of victimhood culture leading to political tyranny; discrimination against conservative people; the manifestations of victimhood culture on the right, and particularly the alt-right.
