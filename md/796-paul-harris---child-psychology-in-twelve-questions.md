RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 24th 2023.  
Dr. Paul Harris is Victor S. Thomas Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. He is interested in the early development of cognition, emotion, and imagination. He is the author of several books, the most recent one being Child Psychology in Twelve Questions.

In this episode, we focus on Child Psychology in Twelve Questions. We get into some of the questions explored in the book, including attachment theory; language comprehension; the kinds of questions children ask; if children live in a fantasy world; if they are natural psychologists; memory; developing an understanding of emotion; morality; their trusting of adults; believing in God; understanding death; and cross-cultural variation and universality in child psychology.
