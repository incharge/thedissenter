Dr. Ruth Feldman is the Simms-Mann Professor of Developmental Social Neuroscience at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzlia with joint appointment at Yale Child Study Center. With degrees in music composition (summa cum-laude), neuroscience (with honors), clinical psychology (with honors), and developmental psychology and psychopathology, her approach integrates perspectives from neuroscience, human development, philosophy, clinical practice, and the arts within an interpersonal frame and a behavior-based approach.  Her conceptual model on biobehavioral synchrony systematically describes how a lived experience within close relationships builds brains, creates relationships, confers resilience, and promotes creativity.  Her studies were the first to detail the role of oxytocin in the formation of human social bonds. Her studies often follow children from infancy to adulthood, address topics that are highly relevant to the general public, and receive substantial media attention. Dr. Feldman is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and received multiple awards, including a Rothschild award, NARSAD independent investigator award (twice), the Zeskind award for best paper in Biological Psychiatry, and the Graven’s Award for research on high-risk infants.

In this episode, we focus on the neurobiology of attachment. We talk about the evolution of attachment, the oxytocin system, and parental investment; biobehavioral synchrony between parent and offspring; how events like postpartum depression, premature birth, and early trauma can disrupt development; and individual and sex differences in predisposition for resilience.
