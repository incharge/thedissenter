RECORDED ON JULY 6th 2023.  
Dr. Bernard Reginster is Professor of Philosophy at Brown University. Dr. Reginster's research has focused mostly on issues in ethics, metaethics, and moral psychology in 19th century German philosophy. His new research interests include the topics of identity and intersubjectivity, for which he considers ideas from psychoanalytic theory, 20th century Continental philosophy, and contemporary Anglo-Saxon philosophy. He is the author of The Will to Nothingness: An Essay on Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality.

In this episode, we focus on The Will to Nothingness. We start by talking about the premise of On the Genealogy of Morality, if Nietzsche’s approach is naturalistic, and what functionality means in the context of morality. We discuss how Nietzsche understood the relationship between morality and affect, and the affect of ressentiment. We talk about Christian morality as an act of revenge, master and slave morality, where the ideas of “good” and “evil” come from, and the role of guilt and punishment. Finally, we discuss what the will to nothingness is.
