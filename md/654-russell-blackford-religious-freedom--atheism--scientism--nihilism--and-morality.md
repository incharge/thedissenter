Dr. Russell Blackford is a Fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and a Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism.

He is the author of several books, including Freedom of Religion and the Secular State, 50 Great Myths About Atheism, The Mystery of Moral Authority, and The Tyranny of Opinion: Conformity and the Future of Liberalism.

In this episode, we talk about religion, atheism, science, and morality. We start with religious freedom, and the modern secular state. We define atheism, and get into the conflict between religion and science. We then talk about moral authority, the objectivity of morality, moral skepticism, and the relationship between moral nihilism and atheism.
