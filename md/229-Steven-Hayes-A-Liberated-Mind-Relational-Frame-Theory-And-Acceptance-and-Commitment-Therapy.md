Dr. Steven C. Hayes is Nevada Foundation Professor in the Behavior Analysis program at the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. An author of 44 books and nearly 600 scientific articles, his career has focused on an analysis of the nature of human language and cognition and the application of this to the understanding and alleviation of human suffering. He is the developer of Relational Frame Theory, an account of human higher cognition, and has guided its extension to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a popular evidence-based form of psychotherapy that uses mindfulness, acceptance, and values-based methods. His most recent books include Evolution and Contextual Behavioral Science, and A Liberated Mind: How to Pivot Toward What Matters.

In this episode, we talk about some of the topics from Dr. Hayes’ recent books. We first discuss evolutionary psychology, the role of genetics and the environment, and the extended evolutionary synthesis in the evolutionary sciences. In the second part of the interview, we talk about behaviorism since Skinner, Relational Frame Theory (RFT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
