This is our second interview. You can watch the first one, on the philosophy of effective altruism and longtermism, here: https://youtu.be/ES-fPqMXXng

In this episode, we focus on Human Extinction. We start by discussing how old the idea of human extinction is in Western history. We then talk about five existential moods across history, and get into anthropogenic extinction, natural causes of extinction, and the existential mood of our current moment. We discuss what people might mean by “human” and “extinction”. Finally, we talk about ideas in favor of human extinction.
