In this episode, we focus on The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit. We define bullshit, and discuss the motivations behind bullshitting, and the social contexts that promote it. We talk about the costs of bullshit, individual differences in proneness and susceptibility to bullshitting. We discuss how we can determine that something is bullshit, and signs of it. We go into the tactics employed by bullshit artists. We discuss why TED Talks might be problematic, and help disseminate bullshit. Finally, we discuss how we can prevent bullshit from spreading.
