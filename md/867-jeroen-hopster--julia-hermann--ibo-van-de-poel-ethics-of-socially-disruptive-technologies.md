In this episode, we focus on Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies. We start by discussing the ethics of technology, what socially disruptive technologies are, and the intercultural outlook of the book. We then go through social media, social robots, climate engineering, and ectogestative technology. We also discuss who should be held responsible for social disruption, and whether technology is neutral.
