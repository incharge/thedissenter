RECORDED ON JULY 22nd 2020.  
Dr. Kristina Durante is an evolutionary psychologist and Professor of Marketing, Marketing Department Vice Chair, and the marketing Ph.D. program coordinator at Rutgers Business School. She is a social psychologist interested in the biology of decision-making. Her research lies at the intersection of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and consumer decision-making. Her areas of expertise include women’s consumer choice and luxury spending, family consumer decisions, hormones and behavior, and the psychological consequences of ambiguity.

In this episode, we talk about the complicated trade-off women many times have to make between family and career in modern industrialized societies. We talk about the role of fathers and arranged marriages in our evolutionary history. We question if women really have an impulse to want children. We discuss gender norms and the sexual division of labor, and the negative impacts they might have. We get into the trade-off between career and family, and how modern societies lack incentives and opportunities for women to invest in both. We talk about the negative effects the pandemic had on families and careers. Finally, we discuss how evolutionary psychology can help women deal with this trade-off.
