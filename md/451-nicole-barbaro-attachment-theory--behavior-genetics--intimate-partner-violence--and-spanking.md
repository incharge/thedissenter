RECORDED ON MARCH 18th 2021.  
Dr. Nicole Barbaro is Educational Research Scientist for WGU Labs, an Adjunct Professor at Utah Valley University, and the Communications Officer for the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. Her interests are in human sexual psychology and behavior, including application of life history theory and sperm competition theory.

In this episode, we focus on attachment theory and behavioral genetics. We dissect attachment theory, going through topics like the different attachment styles; their relationship with personality; what we know about the behavioral genetics of attachment; the shared and the non-shared environment; the evolution of attachment; and environment unpredictability. We discuss the relationship between anxious attachment and intimate partner violence. We talk about a recent paper on the effects of spanking on psychosocial outcomes. Finally, we discuss the relationship between behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology, and we end with a question from a patron of the show.
