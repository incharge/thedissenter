RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 14th 2022.  
Dr. Marya Schechtman is an LAS Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, as well as a member of the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience at the University of Illinois Chicago. Her main areas of interest are personal identity, practical reasoning, and bioethics. She is the author of books like The Constitution of Selves (Cornell 1996), and Staying Alive: Personal Identity, Practical Concerns, and the Unity of a Life (Oxford 2014).

In this episode, we talk about the self. We start by discussing what the self is, and its relationship with personal identity. We discuss if it is a narrative, if it is unitary, and if coherence is important. We also talk about the social aspects of the self, and ask if we can develop separate selves in virtual worlds.
