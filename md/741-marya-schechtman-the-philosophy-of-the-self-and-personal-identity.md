Dr. Marya Schechtman is an LAS Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, as well as a member of the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience at the University of Illinois Chicago.

She is the author of books like The Constitution of Selves (Cornell 1996), and Staying Alive: Personal Identity, Practical Concerns, and the Unity of a Life (Oxford 2014).

In this episode, we talk about the self. We start by discussing what the self is, and its relationship with personal identity. We discuss if it is a narrative, if it is unitary, and if coherence is important. We also talk about the social aspects of the self, and ask if we can develop separate selves in virtual worlds.
