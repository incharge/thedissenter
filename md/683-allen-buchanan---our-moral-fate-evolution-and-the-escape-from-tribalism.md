RECORDED ON JUNE 21st 2022.  
Dr. Allen Buchanan is James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Duke University, and Laureate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona. He has written six books covering such topics as applied ethics (especially bio-medical ethics), social justice, and international justice, including the foundations of international law. He is the author of Our Moral Fate: Evolution and the Escape from Tribalism.

In this episode, we focus on Our Moral Fate.  We discuss how to think about morality from an evolutionary perspective. We get into wrong assumptions people have about tribalism and cooperation. We talk about the Two Great Expansions of our moral circle, involving human beings and nonhuman animals. We discuss how moral progress occurs, and if we should talk about moral change in terms of “progress” and “regress”. We talk about moral reasoning and its limitations. We get into what ideology is from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, we talk about recent tribalism, and scientifically-informed moral institutional design.
