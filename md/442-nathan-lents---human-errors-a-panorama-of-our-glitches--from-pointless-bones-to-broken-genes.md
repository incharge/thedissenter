RECORDED ON DECEMBER 17th 2020.  
Dr. Nathan H. Lents is Professor of Biology and director of the honors program and the campus Macaulay Honors College program at John Jay College. Dr. Lents is noted for his work in cell biology, genetics, and forensic science, as well as his popular science writing and blogging on the evolution of human biology and behavior. He is the author of books like Not So Different: Finding Human Nature in Animals, and Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes.

In this episode, we talk about Human Errors. During the interview, we discuss many different physical, physiological and psychological errors, including things like genetic errors, problems with our reproduction, and cognitive biases. We start by defining them. We also talk about the effects that modern medicine is having on our evolution; predicting our evolutionary future; to what extent we need these errors to function properly; sources of evidence for the fact that we are still evolving; eliminating the errors through genetic engineering and human enhancement; the possibility of living forever; and ways humans are better than other animals.
