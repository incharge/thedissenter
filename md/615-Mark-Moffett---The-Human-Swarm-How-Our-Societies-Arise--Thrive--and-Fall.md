RECORDED ON JANUARY 21st 2022.  
Dr. Mark W. Moffett is a tropical biologist and research associate at the Smithsonian and used to be a visiting scholar in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, which he used to write his book, The Human Swarm: How Our Societies Arise, Thrive, and Fall.

In this episode, we focus on The Human Swarm. We go through topics like: what is a society; what makes humans successful; different types of hunter-gatherer societies; how societies scale up; markers of membership; how people think about societies; identities, and how they change over time; the lifecycle of societies, including how they end; war and peace across human history; transfers of membership, slavery and subjugation; immigration, and how citizenship is determined; and the necessity of societies.
