RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 13th, 2020.

Dr. Holger Wiese is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Durham University, where he runs an EEG lab. He is mainly interested in face recognition and face perception. He investigates how we recognize familiar faces, how we learn new facial identities, why people are more accurate at remembering faces of their own ethnic and age groups, how we perceive age, sex, and attractiveness in unfamiliar faces, and how our knowledge about other people is structured in semantic memory. He is also interested in how these aspects of face and person perception change across the adult lifespan.

In this episode, we talk about face recognition. We first refer to its possible function(s), and how it is processed in the brain. We discuss what information people get from faces, and the phenomena of face familiarity and what makes faces distinctive. We also refer to biases in face recognition, and if they can me modified. Other topics include: cognitive ageing and difficulties in face recognition; the relationship between semantic memory and face memory; male and female faces; and facial attractiveness.
