In this episode, we talk about the psychology of criminal behavior. We go through the several levels of analysis for the development of criminal behavior, including its evolutionary bases, its behavioral genetics, prenatal factors, sex differences, the role of self-control, the influence of peer groups, maternal and paternal environmental and genetic influences, and social factors. We also talk about personality traits, the Dark Triad traits, and if this knowledge should be applied to the criminal justice system.
