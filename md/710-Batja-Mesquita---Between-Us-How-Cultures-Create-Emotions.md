RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 9th 2022.  
Dr. Batja Mesquita is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Leuven, Belgium, where she studies the role of culture in emotions, and of emotions in culture and society. She is director of the Center for Social and Cultural Psychology in Leuven. She is the author of Between Us: How Cultures Create Emotions.

In this episode, we focus on Between Us. We start by talking about what emotions are, and their functions. We discuss how people think about and categorize emotions, and the MINE (Mental, Inside, Essentialist) and OURS (Outside, Relational, Situational) models of emotions, and their relationship with wellbeing. We talk about raising children cross-culturally, and attachment styles. We go through a few emotions, like anger and shame, and love and happiness, how they manifest across cultures, and ask if love is at the basis of all intimate relationships, and if everyone cares about happiness. We talk about how language relates to emotion, and the developmental aspects associated with emotion acquisition. We discuss the applications of research on emotion, and how emotions also make culture. Finally, we talk about the work of Paul Ekman, evolutionary approaches to emotion, “basic emotions”, and the valence of emotions.
