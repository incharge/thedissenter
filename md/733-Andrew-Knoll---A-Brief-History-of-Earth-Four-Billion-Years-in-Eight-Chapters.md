In this episode, we focus on A Brief History of Earth. We cover some of the main events in the history of the Earth, including: its formation; the formation of its atmosphere; where water came from; plate tectonics; the origins of life; the rise of oxygen; evolution, from the first unicellular organisms to animals; the colonization of land by plants and animals; the mass extinctions; and the evolution of H. sapiens, and its ecological impact. Finally, we talk about the future of the Earth.
