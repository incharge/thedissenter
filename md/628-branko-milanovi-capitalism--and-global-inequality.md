RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 16th 2022.  
Dr. Branko Milanović is Presidential Professor at the Graduate Center and a senior fellow at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at The City University of New York (CUNY). Dr. Milanović’s main area of work is income inequality, in individual countries and globally, as well as historically, among pre-industrial societies (Roman Empire, Byzantium, and France before the Revolution), and even inequality in soccer. His books include “The Haves and the Have-nots: A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global Inequality”, “Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization”, and “Capitalism, Alone”.

In this episode, we focus on “Capitalism, Alone”. We start by defining capitalism, and distinguishing mainly between political capitalism and liberal meritocratic capitalism. We talk about China’s political capitalism, and the historical role of communism. We get into economic inequality, and discuss how it is measured, recent trends, what drives it, if it is a problem, and how to reduce it. We discuss specifically Universal Basic Income as a proposed solution. Finally, we ask if capitalism has been a net-positive for global society, and if it is possible to predict its future.
