RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2022.  
Dr. Stephen Darwall is the Andrew Downey Orrick Professor of Philosophy at Yale University. He is deeply interested in moral philosophy and its history, and is focused on questions around the nature of moral obligation and well-being.

In this episode, we talk about some concepts in moral philosophy. We talk about Dr. Darwall’s take on “morality as accountability”, and how morality is objective. We discuss concepts such as moral obligation (and duty), moral respect, moral rights, and dignity. We talk about the interplay between morality and the law. We discuss the second-person standpoint, second-person morality, and how we move from it to a universal morality. Finally, we talk about the relationship between moral philosophy and moral psychology.
