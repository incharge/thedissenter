Jack Symes is the producer of The Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast and editor of the Bloomsbury series, Talking about Philosophy. He is currently Teacher and Researcher of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, UK. He is the editor of Philosophers on Consciousness: Talking about the Mind.

In this episode, we focus on Philosophers on Consciousness. We first talk about The Panpsycast Philosophy Podcast. We discuss what consciousness is, why it matters, and philosophical approaches to it. We ask what we need consciousness for. We talk about the evolution of consciousness, the hard problem of consciousness, illusionism, panpsychism, and supernatural approaches to consciousness. Finally, we discuss what philosophy is about, and its relationship to science.
