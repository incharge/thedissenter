RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 16th, 2019.  
Dr. Noam Chomsky is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, political activist, and social critic. Sometimes called "the father of modern linguistics", Dr. Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media.

In this episode, we go through some of the major highlights in Dr. Chomsky’s intellectual career. We talk about the importance of the cognitive revolution in the 50s/60s, and how behaviorism was dominating back then. We refer to what came to be known as the Chomsky-Piaget debate in 1975, and also address the issue of the modularity of mind. We also discuss evolutionary psychology. Finally, we refer to some of the main points addressed in the debate between Dr. Chomsky and Michel Foucault in 1971, namely human nature from an epistemological perspective and the importance of creativity.
