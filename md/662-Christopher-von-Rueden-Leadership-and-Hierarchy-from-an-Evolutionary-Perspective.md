excerpt: Dr. Christopher von Rueden is Associate Professor of Leadership Studies at
  the University of Richmond. An anthropologist with expertise in traditional human
  societies, his research focuses on how humans form status hierarchies, why we evolved
  to do so, and the demographic and ecological factors that cause our hierarchies
  to be more or less coercive. Relatedly, he studies the role of leader-follower relationships
  in the evolution of human cooperation. In addition to his work on status and leadership,
  he has published on topics such as why humans differ in personality traits and why
  we have such unique life histories among primates.

Dr. Christopher von Rueden is Associate Professor of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond. An anthropologist with expertise in traditional human societies, his research focuses on how humans form status hierarchies, why we evolved to do so, and the demographic and ecological factors that cause our hierarchies to be more or less coercive. Relatedly, he studies the role of leader-follower relationships in the evolution of human cooperation. In addition to his work on status and leadership, he has published on topics such as why humans differ in personality traits and why we have such unique life histories among primates.

In this episode, we talk about leadership and hierarchy. We start with leadership from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about hierarchy in human societies. We discuss how human form coalitions and maintain them. We talk about the role of biology, culture, and ecology in the study of hierarchy and leadership. We discuss leader-follower relationships. We talk about leadership in small-scale egalitarian societies versus large-scale unequal societies. Finally, we discuss sex differences in leadership.
