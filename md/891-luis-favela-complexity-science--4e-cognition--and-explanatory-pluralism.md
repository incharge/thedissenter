RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 20th 2023.  
Dr. Luis Favela is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences (tenured) at the University of Central Florida. He is concurrently a Fellow in the Research Corporation for Science Advancement's Molecular Basis of Cognition Scialog program. His research attempts to understand mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary perspective.

In this episode, we start by talking about complexity science, and how it applies to the study of the mind, and the relationship between mind and brain. We then go through embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and extended cognition. We talk about computational-representational approaches in cognitive science and their limitations, and the computer metaphor of the mind. We discuss dynamical systems theory, what a dynamical system is, and a recent dynamical renaissance in neuroscience. Finally, we talk about mechanistic explanations in science, and explanatory pluralism.
