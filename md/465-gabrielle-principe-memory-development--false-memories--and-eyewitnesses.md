In this episode, we talk about how memory develops in children and how it works. We start with some basics about memory development. We Talk about how we rewrite our memories every time we recall them, and memory sharing and memory-sharing styles. We discuss the existence of repressed memories, and how false memories can be engendered. We introduce a bit of an evolutionary perspective, to try to understand why our memories fail in these domains. We also talk about autobiographical memory and its relation with the “self”. Finally, we discuss some of the problems with eyewitness testimonies.
