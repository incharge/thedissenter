Dr. Joshua Knobe is Professor of Philosophy, Linguistics and Psychology at Yale University. A lot of his recent research has been concerned with the impact of people’s moral judgments on their intuitions about questions that might initially appear to be entirely independent of morality (questions about intention, causation, etc.).

In this episode, we talk about topics in experimental philosophy. We discuss how experimental philosophy relates to science. We talk about the relationship between belief and knowledge. We discuss how norm violations interact with causal judgment. We talk about the “true self”, and how moral beliefs influence beliefs about the “true self”, and vice-versa. We discuss how people conceptualize happiness, and how they relate it to moral character. We talk about “folk morality”, and whether people tend to believe in objective moral truths. We discuss people’s philosophical intuitions, with a focus on free will, and how much they vary cross-culturally. We discuss what explains the different views of philosophers, and if they stem from individual differences in cognition. We talk about how moral judgments influence intuitions in folk psychology, and we discuss whether moral judgments influence the production of scientific knowledge. Finally, we discuss if the way people interact socially influences how they construe truth, and if political polarization changes our understanding of truth.
