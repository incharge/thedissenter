RECORDED ON JULY 19th 2021.  
Dr. Ralph Hertwig is Director of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany. His research interests include models of bounded and ecological rationality; decisions from experience; the psychology of risk; lifespan development of decision making; and evidence-based public policy. He is the editor of Deliberate Ignorance: Choosing Not to Know.

In this episode, we focus on Deliberate Ignorance. We define bounded rationality, ecological rationality, and deliberate ignorance. We talk about the cognitive bases of deliberate rationality, and its relationship with biases and heuristics. We discuss how deliberate ignorance can occur in institutions. We talk about a possible evolutionary rationale for deliberate ignorance, what we know about its development in children, and also the cross-cultural evidence for it. We also discuss individual differences in deliberate ignorance, and the correlation with scores on the Big Five’s openness to experience. We discuss how deliberate ignorance manifests itself in science. Finally, we talk about when and why we should fight against deliberate ignorance.
