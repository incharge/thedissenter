RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 19th 2023.  
Dr. Richard Nisbett is the Theodore M. Newcomb Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Research Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He was the recipient of the Donald T. Campbell Award from the American Psychological Association in 1982, and he’s a Guggenheim fellow. He’s also the author of several books, including Culture of Honor, The Geography of Thought, Mindware, and Thinking: A memoir.

In this episode, we talk about topics in social psychology. We start by talking about attribution theory, and how bad people are at identifying the reasoning processes that caused them to behave in a particular way. We then talk about reasoning, intelligence and IQ, and non-IQ cognitive skills. We discuss cognitive differences between people in the West and people in East Asia, how to interpret them, and how malleable they are. Finally, we talk about the replication crisis in psychology.
