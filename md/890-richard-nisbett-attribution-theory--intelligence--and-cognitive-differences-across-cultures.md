RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 19th 2023.

In this episode, we talk about topics in social psychology. We start by talking about attribution theory, and how bad people are at identifying the reasoning processes that caused them to behave in a particular way. We then talk about reasoning, intelligence and IQ, and non-IQ cognitive skills. We discuss cognitive differences between people in the West and people in East Asia, how to interpret them, and how malleable they are. Finally, we talk about the replication crisis in psychology.
