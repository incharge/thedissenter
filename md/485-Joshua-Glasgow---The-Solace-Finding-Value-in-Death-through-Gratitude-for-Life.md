RECORDED ON MARCH 16th 2021.  
Dr. Joshua Glasgow is Associate Professor in (and Chair of) the Philosophy Department at Sonoma State University. Dr. Glasgow works on a variety of topics in moral, political, and legal philosophy.  His publications have covered a variety of issues concerning ethics, the good life, race and racism, language, law, mind, and more. He’s the author of The Solace: Finding Value in Death Through Gratitude for Life.

In this episode, we focus on The Solace. We discuss questions like “What is the meaning of life?”, “What is a good life?”, “Is death bad?”, “What if we lived forever?”, and we tackle several opposite views coming from pessimists, nihilists, and even antinatalists.
