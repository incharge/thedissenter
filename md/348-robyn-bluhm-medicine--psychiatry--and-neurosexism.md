RECORDED ON MAY 7th 2020.  
Dr. Robyn Bluhm is an Associate Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Philosophy and Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University. Her research examines philosophical issues in neuroscience and in medicine, with a particular focus on the relationship between ethical and epistemological questions in these areas. She has written extensively on the philosophy of evidence-based practice and on the use of functional neuroimaging in psychiatry. She is a co-editor of Neurofeminism: Issues at the Intersection of Feminist Theory and Cognitive Science.

In this episode, we focus on the philosophy of medicine, and the philosophy of neuroscience and the neuroscience of gender. We go through some general topics in the philosophy of medicine, like evidence-based medicine, if medicine is a science, how it is influenced by culture, the limitations of the integration between research and practice, the difference between medicine and healthcare, and how philosophy can improve healthcare practice. Then we get into neuroscience, and refer to the limitations of current imaging techniques, and discuss the neuroscience of gender, neurosexism, neurofeminism, and the impact of studying sex differences on society.
