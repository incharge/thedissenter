RECORDED ON JANUARY 11th 2021.  
Dr. William Keith Campbell is a professor in the Department of Psychology in the University of Georgia's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. He has published over 120 peer-reviewed papers and a number of books, including The Handbook of Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Theoretical Approaches, Empirical Findings, and Treatments (with Joshua Miller) and The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement (with Jean Twenge). Dr. Keith Campbell’s new book, in collaboration with Grady College alumna Carolyn Crist, was recently released: “The New Science of Narcissism: Understanding one of the greatest Psychological challenges of our time – and what you can do about it”.

In this episode, we focus on The New Science of Narcissism. First we define narcissism. We talk about its heritability, and the relationship with the Big Five personality traits, and with the Dark Triad. We discuss the benefits and costs of narcissism, for the narcissist and for the people around him. We refer to Trump, and ask if mental health professionals should diagnose political figures. We talk about social media and its relationship with narcissism. We ask if it is possible to reduce levels of narcissism in individuals, and also who should seek therapy. Toward the end, we talk about the cultural aspects of mental disorders, and the questions about narcissism we have yet to answer.
