Dr. Filipe Nobre Faria currently works as a researcher in ethics and political philosophy at the Institute for Philosophy of the Nova University of Lisbon (IFILNOVA). Furthermore, he lectures on subjects of his expertise at the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences/Nova. His main research interest lies in applying the insights of the behavioral and evolutionary sciences to issues in social and political philosophy. He is the author of The Evolutionary Limits of Liberalism: Democratic Problems, Market Solutions and the Ethics of Preference Satisfaction.

In this episode, we focus on The Evolutionary Limits of Liberalism. We start with the premise of the book, and discuss what liberalism is; the opposing force of communitarianism; and individual preferences. We talk about free markets and liberal democracies in their capacity to satisfy preferences. We discuss the multilevel selection framework adopted in the book, and morality from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about moral types, and if it makes sense to distinguish between liberals and conservatives. We then discuss what really limits liberalism evolutionarily, individualism versus collectivism, and if liberal values will go extinct. Finally, we talk about the is/ought distinction.
