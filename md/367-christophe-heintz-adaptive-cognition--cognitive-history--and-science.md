RECORDED ON AUGUST 11th, 2020.  
Dr. Christophe Heintz is Associate Professor at the Central European University, where he leads the research group ACE (Adaptive Cognition and Economics). Dr. Heintz is working on the role of adaptive cognition in shaping economic behavior, cultural evolution, and the history of science. Scientific practices and economic choices have traditionally been described as rational. He attempts to describe them as resulting from both environmental/contextual and psychological causal factors, with a focus on evolved cognition.

In this episode, we talk about adaptive cognition and cognitive history applied to economic choices and science. During our talk, we also discuss cultural attraction theory, reasoning, and folk epistemology.
