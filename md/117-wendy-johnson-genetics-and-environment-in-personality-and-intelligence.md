In this episode, we talk mostly about personality traits and IQ. Topics include: the Big Five, and other personality traits inventories; the reliability of personality measures; the many ways genetics and the environment interact to build up our psychology; how our psychological traits are polygenic (influences by several genes); the influences of parents and other aspects of the environment; the effects of IQ and personality in old age, and the long-term benefits of high IQ and certain personality traits, like conscientiousness.
