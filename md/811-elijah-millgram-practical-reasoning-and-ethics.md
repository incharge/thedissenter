RECORDED ON MARCH 15th 2023.  
Dr. Elijah Millgram is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Utah. His research focuses on rationality, theoretical reasoning, and practical reasoning. He is the author of six books, including Practical Induction, Varieties of Practical Reasoning, Ethics Done Right: Practical Reasoning as a Foundation for Moral Theory, and John Stuart Mill and the Meaning of Life.

In this episode, we talk about practical reasoning. We start by discussing what practical reasoning is, and the questions it applies to. We talk about different theories of practical reasoning, and problems with means-end approaches. We discuss how practical reasoning applies to ethics; Kant’s practical reason; and how practical reasoning relates to virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology. We discuss if ethics is just a matter of preference. We also talk about the ways practical reasoning can be wrong, how it differs from reflective equilibrium, and how to deal with the issue of defeasibility.
