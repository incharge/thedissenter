RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 18th 2023.  
Dr. Alicia Juarrero is President and Founder of VectorAnalytica. Her research in neurophilosophy has been focused on the causal role of context-sensitive constraints in the emergence of mental events such as intentions. She is the author of several books, the most recent one being Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence.

In this episode, we focus on Context Changes Everything. We start by discussing the problem of identity, how change is compatible with remaining the same, and why Western science and philosophy cannot deal with the relations between parts and wholes. We talk about coherence, the problem of causation, and Aristotle’s four causes. We discuss what constraints are, and talk about context-independent and context-dependent constraints, and how they apply to the study of infectious diseases. We talk about identity theory, and multiple realizability in neuroscience. Finally, we discuss 4E cognition, and how intentions, thoughts, and beliefs can cause anything.
