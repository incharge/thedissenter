RECORDED ON MAY 5th 2023.  
Dr. Susanna Schellenberg is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Science at Rutgers University, where she holds a secondary appointment at the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science. She specializes in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language and is best known for her work on perceptual experience, evidence, capacities, mental content, and imagination. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Award, a Humboldt Prize, and a Mellon New Directions Fellowship for a project on the Neuroscience of Perception. She is the author of The Unity of Perception: Content, Consciousness, Evidence.

In this episode, we focus on The Unity of Perception. We get into perception from a philosophical perspective, and some of the most prominent approaches to it. We talk about analyzing the mind in terms of capacities (capacitism). We discuss the role of context in perception, and understanding the difference between perception and hallucination. We talk about Dr. Schellenberg’s Particularity Thesis of perception. We discuss perceptual knowledge. We talk about the relation between perception and consciousness. We discuss a constructivist perspective of perception, and how perception relates to reality. We talk about the relation between perception and thought. Finally, we talk about how capacitism deals with evidence and knowledge.
