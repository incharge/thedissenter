Fredrik DeBoer is a writer and academic. He writes a newsletter on culture and politics. He is the author of The Cult of Smart, and, more recently, How Elites Ate the Social Justice Movement.

In this episode, we focus on How Elites Ate the Social Justice Movement. We start by talking about the current cultural and political context in the US and its historical background. We discuss the George Floyd incident and its aftermath, and the Black Lives Matter movement. We define the “elites” in the social justice movement, and talk about the political consequences of the social justice movement being taken over by them. We discuss affirmative action, and intersectionality. We talk about the term “woke”. Finally, we discuss solutions to improve leftist activism in the US.
