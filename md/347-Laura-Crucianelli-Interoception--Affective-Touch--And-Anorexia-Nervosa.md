RECORDED ON MAY 6th 2020.  
Dr. Laura Crucianelli currently works as a postdoctoral researcher in Henrik Erhsson’s lab at the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm. Dr. Crucianelli completed her PhD at the Department of Psychology, University of Hertfordshire, and in collaboration with University College London under the supervision of Dr. Paul Jenkinson and Dr. Katerina Fotopoulou.  Her PhD project investigated affective touch, sense of body ownership and interoceptive awareness in both healthy and clinical populations.

In this episode, we talk about interoception, and how it can relate to some psychiatric conditions. We go through topics like affective touch, and the sense of body ownership. We talk about the Rubber Hand Illusion, and what it tells us about interoception. We also touch on minimal self-awareness, and how we can communicate emotions through touch. And, finally, we discuss what goes wrong in some clinical populations, focusing on anorexia nervosa patients, and how we might be able to improve psychiatric practices in the future.
