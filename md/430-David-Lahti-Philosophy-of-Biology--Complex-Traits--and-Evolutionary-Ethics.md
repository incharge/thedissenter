Dr. David C. Lahti is an Associate Professor of Biology at Queens College, City University of New York, where he runs a Behavior & Evolution laboratory. His work focuses on evolutionary and behavioral ecology, especially the evolution of complex and learned traits in birds and humans.

Topics include: complex and learned traits; birds, and the evolutionary insights we can get by studying them; culture from an evolutionary perspective; how species lose traits during evolution; evolutionary ethics; human moral universals; gene-culture coevolution; morality and religion; and progress in evolution.
