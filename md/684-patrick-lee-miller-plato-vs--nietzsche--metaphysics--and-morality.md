RECORDED ON JULY 6th 2022.  
Dr. Patrick Lee Miller is an associate professor of Philosophy at Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the author of Becoming God: Pure Reason in Early Greek Philosophy (Bloomsbury, 2012), and co-editor of Introductory Readings in Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy (Hackett, 2015).

In this episode, we talk about Nietzsche and Plato. We start by talking about Nietzsche’s phases in his writings, and ask if The Will to Power should be considered canon. We discuss why we can compare Nietzsche and Plato. And then we get into some of the aspects of their philosophies, and where they diverge and converge, including: the Dionysian, the Apollonian, and the Greek poets; their metaphysics; the Eternal Return, and time as linear or circular; slave and master morality; Plato’s Republic, hierarchy, and democracy; and the differences between the Philosopher King and the Übermensch.
