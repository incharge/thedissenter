RECORDED ON MAY 10th 2023.  
Dr. Jana Gallus is Associate Professor of Strategy and Behavioral Decision Making at UCLA Anderson School of Management. Her research interests lie in behavioral economics, strategy, and innovation, with a focus on recognition incentives and their effects on decision-making. She investigates how incentive schemes can be designed to enhance employee motivation and organizational performance in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.

In this episode, we talk about the psychology and economics of incentives. We start by defining incentives, and their different kinds. We discuss what incentives work, and in what contexts, with Alan Fiske’s relational models framework in mind. We talk about Dr. Gallus’ work experimenting with incentives at Wikipedia, and the role of gender, power, and emotions in the collaborative production of knowledge there. We discuss if gendered behavior might be influenced by relative social standing. We talk about peer comparison information, how it is used, and when it works. Finally, we discuss gender gaps in knowledge contributions in academia, and where they stem from.
