Dr. Michael Ruse is a philosopher of science who specializes in the philosophy of biology and works on the relationship between science and religion, the creation–evolution controversy, and the demarcation problem within science. He currently teaches at Florida State University, where he is Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor and Director of HPS Program. He’s also a very prolific writer, author of books like The Darwinian Revolution, Darwin and Design, and On Purpose. 

In this episode, we talk about the scientific and philosophical revolution operated by Darwinism, and the many beliefs that it undermined. We go through how natural selection works; gene-culture coevolution; what are the units of selection in evolution; the concept of species; race and its biological basis; the problems with genetic engineering; and the schism between science and religion.
