Dr. Gaukroger has completed a long-term project on the emergence and consolidation of a scientific culture in the West from 1210 to 1935: The Emergence of a Scientific Culture (Oxford, 2006),The Collapse of Mechanism and the Rise of Sensibility(Oxford, 2010),The Natural and the Human (Oxford, 2016), Civilization and the Culture of Science (Oxford, 2020).

His new book is The Failures of Philosophy: A Historical Essay. 

In this episode, we focus on The Failures of Philosophy. We first discuss what Dr. Gaukroger means by failures in Philosophy in his book. We ask what philosophy is, and what we can learn about it by studying how it failed. We get into some of the history of philosophy, from Plato to the natural philosophers. Finally, we discuss the current status of philosophy, how it relates to science, and its possible future.
