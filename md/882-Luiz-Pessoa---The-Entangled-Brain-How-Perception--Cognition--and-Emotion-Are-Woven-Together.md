  and functional MRI methods to study cognition and emotion (as manipulated, for instance,
  via the threat of shock), with an emphasis on the interactions between cognitive
  and emotional brain systems. He also studies interactions between cognition and
  motivation (as manipulated, for instance, via cash reward). An additional focus
  of his research centers on the development of statistical and computational tools

RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 4th 2023.  
Dr. Luiz Pessoa is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland, and Director of the Maryland Neuroimaging Center. Dr. Pessoa uses behavioral and functional MRI methods to study cognition and emotion (as manipulated, for instance, via the threat of shock), with an emphasis on the interactions between cognitive and emotional brain systems. He also studies interactions between cognition and motivation (as manipulated, for instance, via cash reward). An additional focus of his research centers on the development of statistical and computational tools for the analysis of fMRI data, particularly methods to link moment-to-moment fluctuations in behavior to single-trial brain responses. He is the author of The Entangled Brain: How Perception, Cognition, and Emotion Are Woven Together.

In this episode, we focus on The Entangled Brain. We start by discussing some of the most prominent approaches to studying the brain and how it operates, with a focus on the modularity of the brain approach, and a complex systems approach. We talk about what a brain “area” is, and the notion of brain networks. We discuss the relationship between emotion and cognition, and what it means to say that networks are dynamical. We talk about the evolution of the brain. Finally, we discuss the need for multidisciplinarity in science.
