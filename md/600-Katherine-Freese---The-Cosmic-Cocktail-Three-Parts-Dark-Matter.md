RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th 2021.  
Dr. Katherine Freese is a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin, where she holds the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics. She is known for her work in theoretical cosmology at the interface of particle physics and astrophysics. She is the author of The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter.

In this episode, we focus on The Cosmic Cocktail. We talk about percentages of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the Universe, and how we got to them. We get into the history of theorizing about dark matter, what we know about it, potential particles, and its origins. We then move into dark energy. We also discuss the geometry of the Universe, gravity, and the future of the Universe.
