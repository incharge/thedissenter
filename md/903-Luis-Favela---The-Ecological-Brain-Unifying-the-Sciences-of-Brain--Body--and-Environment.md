RECORDED ON JANUARY 3rd 2024.  
Dr. Luis Favela is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences (tenured) at the University of Central Florida. He is concurrently a Fellow in the Research Corporation for Science Advancement's Molecular Basis of Cognition Scialog program. His research attempts to understand mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary perspective. He is the author of The Ecological Brain: Unifying the Sciences of Brain, Body, and Environment.

In this episode, we focus on The Ecological Brain. We first discuss ecological psychology, and neuroscience, how they split historically, and why it seems hard to reconcile them. We talk about two traditions in neuroscience: one focusing on biological features of neurons, and the other focusing on abstract features of neurons. We discuss complexity science. We get into Dr. Favela’s NExT (NeuroEcological Nexus Theory) framework, the hypotheses derived from it, and limitations of brain-centered approaches. We discuss what the ecological brain is. Finally, we talk about the main challenges to the NExT framework, non-mechanistic explanations, and the importance of interdisciplinarity.
