In this episode, we talk about childhood and attachment theory. We start off by talking about the evolutionary and ecological bases of parent-offspring relationships, including parent-offspring conflict, and the different evolved strategies of attachment. We also discuss modern attachment theory, and the main differences between it and classical attachment theory as developed first by John Bowlby, how it relates to life history theory, and the several different attachment styles that we have, including secure/autonomous, avoidant/dismissing, resistant/preoccupied, and disorganized. In the second part of the interview we also refer to parent-offspring conflict and child maltreatment; the risks and benefits of daycare; and differential susceptibility in children to different life circumstances during their development and different parenting styles.
