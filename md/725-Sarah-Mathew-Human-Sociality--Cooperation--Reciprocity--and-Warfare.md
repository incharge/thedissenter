excerpt: Dr. Sarah Mathew is Associate Professor in the School of Human Evolution
  and Social Change at Arizona State University. She studies the evolution of human
  ultra-sociality and the role of culture in enabling it. She is especially interested
  in how humans evolved the capacity to cooperate with millions of genetically unrelated
  individuals, and how this links to the origins of moral sentiments, prosocial behavior,
  norms, and large-scale warfare. To address these issues, she directs a theoretically-informed
  field research program among the Turkana, a subsistence pastoral society in Kenya
  who cooperate at a large scale, including in lethal interethnic raids, without formal
  centralized political institutions.

Dr. Sarah Mathew is Associate Professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. She studies the evolution of human ultra-sociality and the role of culture in enabling it. She is especially interested in how humans evolved the capacity to cooperate with millions of genetically unrelated individuals, and how this links to the origins of moral sentiments, prosocial behavior, norms, and large-scale warfare. To address these issues, she directs a theoretically-informed field research program among the Turkana, a subsistence pastoral society in Kenya who cooperate at a large scale, including in lethal interethnic raids, without formal centralized political institutions.

In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human sociality. We start by talking about how human sociality differs from the sociality of other closely-related species, and what enables it. We get into perception errors, what they are, and how they impact reciprocity. We discuss how humans cooperate with an immense number of genetically unrelated individuals. We talk about what leads to warfare, and the phenomenon of moral injury and how it relates to PTSD. Finally, we talk about the role of culture in facilitating small-scale cooperation.
