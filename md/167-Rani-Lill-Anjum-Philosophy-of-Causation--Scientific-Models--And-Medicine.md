Dr. Rani Lill Anjum is Research Fellow in Philosophy at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) School of Economics and Business, and Leader of the CAPS – Center for Applied Philosophy of Science since 2018.

In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of causation, and a new approach to causation in philosophy and science developed by Dr. Lill Anjum in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Mumford, based on a metaphysics of powers or dispositions. We discuss how we should think about causality when there are several factors acting on a particular phenomenon; the intrinsic limitations of scientific models of the world; how can shifting from neuron diagrams of causal relations to vectors might improve those same models; and reductionism and emergentism. Throughout the interview, Dr. Lill Anjum illustrates all of these issues with examples coming from medicine, an area she has been focusing a lot of her work on causation recently.
