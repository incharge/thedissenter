Dr. Inês Hipólito is a Lecturer at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where she investigates the reciprocal relationship between the representational structures, basic cognition, and the nervous system. Additionally, as an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent Grant Fellow at the University of Amsterdam, she studies the emergence of artificial intelligence as Augmented Cognition. Her research has earned her 19 awards and she has presented her findings at over 30 scientific events, 7 of which she was invited to speak as a keynote speaker. As a co-founder and vice-president of the International Society of the Philosophy of the Sciences of the Mind, she is a passionate advocate for diversity and inclusivity in the field, serving as an elected member of the Women in Philosophy Committee and the Committee in Diversity and Inclusivity at the Australasian Association of Philosophy.

In this episode, we start by talking about embodied and enactive cognitive science.  We discuss an enactive-dynamic model of cognition, and how to think about psychological traits. We get into an enactive account of culture, and how psychological experiences are interpreted in particular cultural contexts. We also discuss social cognition from an enactivist perspective, and the role of theory of mind. We then talk about enactive artificial intelligence. We discuss why technology is not neutral, and feminist technoscience principles. We address a question from a patron regarding AI and human cognition. Finally, we talk about the need for cognitive and cultural diversity in science.
