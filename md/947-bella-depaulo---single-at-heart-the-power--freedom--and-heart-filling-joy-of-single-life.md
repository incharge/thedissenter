RECORDED ON APRIL 2nd 2024.  
Dr. Bella DePaulo is the leading expert on single life and has been described by The Atlantic as “America’s foremost thinker and writer on the single experience.” Dr. DePaulo coined the term “single at heart.” After two decades as a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, Dr. DePaulo moved to the West Coast, where she is currently an academic affiliate in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her latest book is Single at Heart: The Power, Freedom, and Heart-Filling Joy of Single Life.

In this episode, we focus on Single at Heart. We talk about who the “single at heart” people are, their psychological traits, gender differences, the opportunities singlehood offers, and how single people deal with solitude. We discuss whether they feel the need to have kids, and their psychological well-being and life outcomes compared to people in romantic relationships. We talk about social and political discrimination against single people, and where the stigma against them stems from. We also discuss casual relationships, how to interpret statistics about people who do not have sex, new forms of relationships, and what people in relationships can learn from this.
