======SORRY ABOUT THE BACKGROUND NOISE THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO. I THINK DR. COSMIDES’ VOICE IS STILL VERY PERCEPTIBLE, BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NOISE MIGHT BE A BIT ANNOYING. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT ANYWAY.======

Dr. Leda Cosmides pioneered the field of Evolutionary Psychology. She’s got a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology by the University of Harvard. Dr. Cosmides did postdoctoral work with Roger Shepard at Stanford and was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. Dr. Cosmides won the 1988 American Association for the Advancement of Science Prize for Behavioral Science Research, the 1993 American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology, and a J. S. Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. She is currently Professor of Psychology at UC Santa Barbara. She and John Tooby founded and co-direct the UCSB Center for Evolutionary Psychology. And she is also the co-author of the great book The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.  
Here, we talk about what is the history and development of Evolutionary Psychology; the problems with the Standard Social Science Model; the evolutionary environment of adaptedness (EEA); adaptations, by-products, and noise; ultimate vs proximate explanations; cognitive modules, and the problem with Jerry Fodor’s approach to them; variability and universality in human psychology and behavior; the application to evolutionary psychology to stereotypes, politics and human relationships; literal and metaphorical truth; and the view of human nature coming from evolutionary psychology.
