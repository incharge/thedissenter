RECORDED ON DECEMBER 28th 2022.  
Dr. Frederick Toates is Emeritus Professor of Biological Psychology at the Open University. Dr. Toates' research interests are primarily in the area of motivation. He is the author of a number of books, the most recent one being Understanding Sexual Serial Killing.

In this episode, we focus on Understanding Sexual Serial Killing. We start by defining sexual serial killing, and get into what motivates it. We talk about the psychological traits, the social context, and sociohistorical context of sexual serial killing. We discuss the best model to explain it, biological factors, working models and scripts during child development, what triggers sexual arousal, paraphilias, and addiction. We also discuss if there is a copycat effect in this type of crime.
