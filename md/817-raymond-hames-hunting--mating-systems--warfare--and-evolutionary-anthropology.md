RECORDED ON JUNE 8th 2023.  
Dr. Raymond Hames is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research interests are in behavioral ecology, food and labor exchange, human ecology, marriage, and kin and parental investment. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (anthropology section), past-president of the Evolutionary Anthropology Society of the American Anthropological Association, consulting editor for Human Nature, and for ten years he served as treasurer of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. 

In this episode, we talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology and human behavioral ecology. We first talk about male hunting, and what we can learn about human sociality by studying it. We discuss if hunting peoples are conservationists. We talk about the costs and benefits of monogamy and polygyny for women, and what explains polyandry. We discuss human warfare, the debate between the “deep-rooters” and the “shallow-rooters”, and Chagnon’s argument that Unokai have more wives and children than others. We talk about male androphilia, its universality, and what explains it. We discuss the divide between the evolutionary and sociocultural subfields within anthropology, and address criticisms of evolutionary anthropology. Finally, we talk about the relationship between human behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology.
