RECORDED ON DECEMBER 6th, 2019.  
Dr. Laith Al-Shawaf is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). Before, he was an Assistant Professor at Bilkent University in Turkey and a Visiting Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, Germany. Laith has taught and conducted research in several different countries, and is a member of the Arab-German Young Academy (AGYA), as well as an academic adviser at Ideas Beyond Borders (IBB).

In this episode, we go through some of the theoretical foundations of Evolutionary Psychology. We first tackle some misconceptions, like the one about “just-so stories”, how biological mechanisms are designed, genetic determinism, and adaptations. We then talk about how hypotheses are generated in Evolutionary Psychology, the focus of the discipline on psychological mechanisms and not so much on manifest behavior, and the importance of Tinbergen’s 4 Questions. We also discuss learning, context and environment in Evolutionary Psychology. Finally, we address the issue of individual differences, and if we can make predictions about how our psychology will evolve in the future.
