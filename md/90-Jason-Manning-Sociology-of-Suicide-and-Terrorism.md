Dr. Jason Manning is an Associate Professor of Sociology at West Virginia University. He’s a theoretical sociologist who seeks to develop general explanations of human behavior, his work focuses primarily on conflict and social control, including various means of expressing grievances, handling disputes, and punishing offenses. Within this area he specializes in violent conflict, particularly in self-destructive forms of violence such as protest suicide, homicide-suicide, and suicide terrorism.

In this episode, I talk with Dr. Manning about suicide, from a sociological perspective. More specifically we talk about what is suicide, and why people commit it; suicide as a form of social control; suicide-homicide; and suicide as a political weapon.
