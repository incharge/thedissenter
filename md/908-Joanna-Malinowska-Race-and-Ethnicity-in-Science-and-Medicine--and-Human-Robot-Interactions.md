RECORDED ON OCTOBER 24th 2023.  
Dr. Joanna Malinowska is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland. The subject of her research is a broadly understood philosophy of science, with particular emphasis on philosophy of medicine, philosophy of neurosciences and philosophy of psychology. She explores connections between these areas and questions in bioethics, epistemology, ontology, and methodology. Her current focus is on the conceptualization and use of ethnoracial categories in medicine.

In this episode, we first talk about cultural neuroscience. We then get into the concepts of race and ethnicity, their scientific validity, the idea of racialization, and studying differences between human populations. We discuss the consequences of racialized medical information, and what a postracial medicine could look like. Finally, we talk about empathy in human-robot interactions.
