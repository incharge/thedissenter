Dr. Stuart Vyse is a psychologist, teacher, speaker, and author who specializes in belief in superstitions and critical thinking. He is a contributing editor for Skeptical Inquirer magazine. He has written personal and professional essays in a variety of places, including the Observer, Medium, The Atlantic, The Good Men Project, Tablet, and Time. His book Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition won the American Psychological Association's William James Book Award. His latest book is The Uses of Delusion: Why It's Not Always Rational to Be Rational.

In this episode, we focus on The Uses of Delusion. We start by asking what it means to be rational. We define “delusion”. We go through different delusions and domains where delusions manifest, including self-flattering delusions, optimism and pessimism; health, and traumatic events; superstitions, and rituals; religion; romantic relationships, and dating; self-fulfilling prophecies; dreams; the “self”; and free will, and the illusion of control. Finally, we talk about instrumental rationality.
