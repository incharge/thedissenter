RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2022.  
Dr. Martin Lang is an Assistant Professor at Masaryk University investigating the evolution of ritual behavior and the relationship between anxiety and rituals.

In this episode, we first talk about synchrony in the context of ritual, its psychological effects, identity fusion, how rituals might help internalize norms, and the effects of religious music. We then get into anxiety, what induces it, and how ritualized behavior helps control it. We also talk about the psychological effects of extreme religious practices. We discuss the cultural evolution od moralizing gods, and the relationship between religiosity and prosociality. Finally, we talk about a complex adaptive systems approach to the study of religion.
