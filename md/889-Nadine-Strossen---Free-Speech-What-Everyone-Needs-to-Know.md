In this episode, we focus on Free Speech. We start by discussing what free speech is, and what free speech advocates really argue for. We talk about what society gains from free speech, and what the limitations on speech should be. We discuss the particular case of hate speech, the concept of the marketplace of ideas, how we should deal with misinformation, and whether social media companies can censor speech. We talk about freedom of the press, and academic freedom. Finally, we discuss whether the US is a special case in how free speech is approached politically and legally, and the current state of free speech across the globe.
