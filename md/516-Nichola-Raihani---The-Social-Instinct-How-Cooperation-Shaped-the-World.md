RECORDED ON AUGUST 10th 2021.  
Dr. Nichola Raihani is Professor of Evolution and Behavior at University College London. Her research considers the evolution of cooperation in nature. She was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology in 2019. Her first book is The Social Instinct: How Cooperation Shaped the World.

In this episode, we focus on The Social Instinct. We first discuss the structure of the book, and why the focus is on cooperation. We talk about the mechanisms used to explain the evolution of cooperation – kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and group selection. We then get into what a family is from a evolutionary perspective, and discuss the role of mothers and fathers, and cooperative breeding. We question the model of the nuclear family, and also talk about grandmothers. We ask why men live so long. We discuss why people help unrelated others, and why we are so uncharitable to those doing good deeds. We ask if we are ultimately selfish. Other topics include: interdependence; why we care so much about what other people think of us; social comparison; and the ability to join together and rebel against tyrannical leaders. We wrap up with discussing how we can promote large-scale cooperation.
