Dr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for his advocacy of antinatalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings. He’s also the author of books like The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys (2012), and The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's Biggest Questions (2017).

In this episode, we focus on anti-natalism, and its several ramifications. We tackle the asymmetry argument from different angles. We talk about how we are predisposed to evaluate life, and if we can do it objectively. We establish a distinction between a life worth continuing and a life worth starting. And we also go through some specific topics like life for nonhuman animals, abortion, suicide, euthanasia, and environmentalism.
