Dr. Limor Raviv is a research associate at the University of Madison, Wisconsin. Her research focuses on the cultural evolution of languages in different social environments. Specifically, she studies how the social structure of the environment affects the grammatical structure of languages.

In this episode, we talk about many questions that Psycholinguistics tries to answer. We ask what why child development is so important for linguistics, and if language is innate, including the poverty of the stimulus argument. We also question if it is really so difficult for adults to acquire a second language. We then discuss the cultural evolution of language, and how we can compare humans to other species. We talk about sign language and creole language. And, finally, we talk about Dr. Raviv’s work on how the social structure of the environment affects the grammatical structure of languages, and the limitations of lab studies.
