RECORDED ON JULY 18th 2023.  
Dr. Cailin O’Connor is Professor in the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at UC Irvine.

Her monograph The Origins of Unfairness was published in July 2019 by Oxford University Press. She is the author of Games in the Philosophy of Biology, and The Misinformation Age.

In this episode, we start by talking about game theory, and what we can study through it. We then talk about social pressure, conformity, conservativism, and selection in science. We discuss if scientific retraction works. We talk about perpetual categories, and if they have evolved to track properties of the world. We discuss learning generalization, and evolutionarily stable strategies. Finally, we talk about misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
