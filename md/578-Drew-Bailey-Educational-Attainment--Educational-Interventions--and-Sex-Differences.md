RECORDED ON OCTOBER 7th 2021.  
Dr. Drew Bailey is Associate Professor in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine. His research interests include mathematical development, individual differences, and longitudinal methods.

In this episode, we talk about individual differences in educational attainment, educational interventions, and sex differences in cognitive abilities. We start by discussing what to think about the finding in behavioral genetics when it comes to educational attainment. We talk about educational interventions, what works and what does not, and how their effects fade out. We discuss if education systems should be reformed, and what are some of the biggest challenges there and how to deal with them. Finally, we discuss sex differences in education, educational choices, and educational attainment; we talk about the gender equality paradox and how it is interpreted and explained; and sex differences in cognitive abilities – verbal, spatial, and mathematical -, and how impactful they are in education.
