RECORDED ON April 15th, 2020.  
Dr. Shaun Nichols is Professor in the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University. He works in philosophy of cognitive science. Most of his research concerns the psychological foundations of philosophical thought. Recently he’s been drawing on learning theory to try to understand how people acquire philosophically significant concepts and distinctions, especially in the domain of morality.

In this episode, we talk about morality. We approach it from a philosophical and scientific perspective. We discuss the role that emotions and other mental mechanisms play. We also refer to child development, learning, and human universals and the folk psychology of morality. Then, we talk about psychopathy and moral rationalism; the link between morality and violence; and the is-ought dichotomy. Finally, we discuss a possible new kind of moral realism.
