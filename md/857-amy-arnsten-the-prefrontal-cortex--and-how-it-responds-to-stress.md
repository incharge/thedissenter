RECORDED ON JUNE 27th 2023.  
Dr. Amy Arnsten is Albert E. Kent Professor of Neuroscience and Professor of Psychology, and member of the Kavli Institute of Neuroscience at Yale University. Dr. Arnsten is an international expert on the molecular regulation of higher cortical circuits, and a member of the National Academy of Medicine. Dr. Arnsten's research examines the neural basis of higher cognition. Her work has revealed that the newly evolved cortical circuits that underlie higher cognition are uniquely regulated at the molecular level, conferring vulnerability in mental illness and age-related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. Her research has led to new treatments for cognitive disorders in humans, including the successful translation of guanfacine (IntunivTM) for the treatment of ADHD and related prefrontal cortical disorders.

In this episode, we talk about the prefrontal cortex and the role it plays in neurological and mental disorders. We start by talking about the organization and functional properties of the prefrontal cortex. We discuss ADHD, conduct disorder, and the neurological effects of long COVID. We get into the biochemical mechanisms behind stress responses. We talk about PTSD, and how to treat it. We talk about the neurological effects of chronic stress. We discuss why the prefrontal cortex is so vulnerable to stress. We talk about targeting aging itself and the mechanisms of aging to prevent neural disorders. Finally, we discuss how neuroscience can help us become more compassionate.
