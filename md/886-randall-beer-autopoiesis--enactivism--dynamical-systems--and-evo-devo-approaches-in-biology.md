excerpt: Dr. Randall Beer is Professor of Cognitive Science and Informatics at Indiana
  University Bloomington. Dr. Beer's primary research interest is in understanding
  how coordinated behavior arises from the dynamical interaction of an animal's nervous
  system, its body and its environment. Toward this end, he works on the evolution
  and analysis of dynamical "nervous systems" for model agents, neuromechanical modeling
  of animals, biologically-inspired robotics, and dynamical systems approaches to
  behavior and cognition. More generally, he is interested in computational and theoretical
  biology, including models of metabolism, gene regulation and development.

Dr. Randall Beer is Professor of Cognitive Science and Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington. Dr. Beer's primary research interest is in understanding how coordinated behavior arises from the dynamical interaction of an animal's nervous system, its body and its environment. Toward this end, he works on the evolution and analysis of dynamical "nervous systems" for model agents, neuromechanical modeling of animals, biologically-inspired robotics, and dynamical systems approaches to behavior and cognition. More generally, he is interested in computational and theoretical biology, including models of metabolism, gene regulation and development.

In this episode, we talk about biology and cognitive science. We first discuss autopoiesis, the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and how it relates to cognition. We talk about motor behavior, a brain-body-environment framework, studying locomotion in C. elegans, and connectomics. We discuss the relationship between biology and cognition, and enactivism. We talk about computational-representationalist approaches, and dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We go through the history of the situated, embodied, and dynamical framework in cognitive science, and 4E cognition. We discuss minimally cognitive agents, and AI systems. Finally, we talk about evo-devo approaches in biology, developmental bias, and the extended evolutionary synthesis.
