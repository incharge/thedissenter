Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.   
Dr. Erez Yoeli is a Research Scientist at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, where he directs the Applied Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism: understanding how it works and how to promote it.   
They are both authors of Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.

This is the second part of our talk about Hidden Games. You can watch the first part here: https://youtu.be/EGEdt6iuSQo.  
This time, we cover topics like strategic ignorance; learning, from the perspective of game theory; the hawk-dove game; where rights come from; why apologies work; why people buy luxury items; why people sometimes hide positive traits of achievements; evidence games; repeated prisoner’s dilemma, and human cooperation; how to promote cooperation and altruism; continuous vs. categorical norms, and how they arise; and how and why people develop passions.
