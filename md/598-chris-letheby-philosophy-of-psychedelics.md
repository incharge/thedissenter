His doctoral research, conducted at the University of Adelaide, presented the first systematic analysis of psychedelic experience within the framework of 21st century philosophy of cognitive science.

In this episode, we focus on Philosophy of Psychedelics. We start by giving an overview of the main topics and questions explored in the philosophy of psychedelics. We then go through epistemology, psychedelic therapy, the neurobiology of psychedelics, changes to the sense of self, and autobiographical changes. We discuss epistemic risks and benefits of psychedelic therapy. Finally, we talk about spiritual experiences from a naturalistic point of view.
