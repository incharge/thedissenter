RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2023.  
Dr. David Pinsof is a research scientist who received his PhD in Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. David’s research focuses on evolutionary psychology, political psychology, public opinion, and sexual behavior. His empirical work explores individual differences in mating psychology and their relation to political attitudes, mathematical models of alliance formation, and the origins of political belief systems.

In this episode, we start by talking about the alliance theory of political belief systems. We discuss common explanations of political belief systems, and their inconsistency; social dynamics, and how people form and maintain alliances; the Democratic/Republican divide in the US; and moral foundations theory, and moral systems. We discuss whether the meaning of life matters, and the motivations behind intellectual debates, including status-seeking. We talk about the link between morality and violence. Finally, we discuss social paradoxes, virtue-signaling, and self-deception.
