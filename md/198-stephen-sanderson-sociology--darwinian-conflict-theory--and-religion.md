Dr. Stephen K. Sanderson is an American sociologist. He was a professor of sociology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Since 2007 he has been a visiting scholar at the Institute for Research on World-Systems at the University of California, Riverside. His areas of focus include comparative sociology, historical sociology, sociological theory and sociocultural evolution. He is a specialist in sociological theory and comparative and historical sociology and is one of the leading sociologists to develop a Darwinian understanding of human society. He has written or edited ten books, including “The Evolution of Human Sociality: A Darwinian Conflict Perspective”, “Evolutionism and Its Critics”, “Human Nature and the Evolution of Society”, and “Religious Evolution and the Axial Age”.

In this episode, we cover a lot of ground in Sociology and the Social Sciences. We start by talking about traditional approaches to sociology, the limitations of sociocultural accounts of human behavior, the importance of fields like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, and the criteria to determine that a behavioral trait has a biological basis. We also discuss how to think about culture, and the relationship between culture and biology, and then Dr. Sanderson gives an overview of his Darwinian conflict theory, that tries to integrate evolutionary theory with Weberian conflict theory (with bits of Marx in there). Finally, we talk about Dr. Sanderson’s work on religion, and three different types of religion – shamanic, polytheistic (pagan), and monotheistic (world transcendent).
