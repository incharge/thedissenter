RECORDED ON APRIL 14th 2021.  
Dr. Elly Vintiadis is a philosopher of mind and psychiatry at Deree, the American College of Greece. Her work focuses on the mind, its products and disorders, and the nature of their dependence on the social environment. She is mainly interested in what mental disorders can tell us about the nature of the mind, and in emergence and explanation, but her research also extends to epistemology, metaphilosophy and animal ethics. She is the author of three books, including Philosophy by Women: 22 Philosophers reflect on Philosophy and Its Value.

In this episode, we focus on Philosophy by Women. We first cover some general topics on philosophy, like what the discipline is really about, the role that emotions and personal experience play in it, and the relationship between philosophy and science. We then talk about philosophy and politics, the impact of philosophy in society, and the ways the general public than profit from learning more about philosophy. Finally, we discuss the position of women in philosophy, discrimination against women, and how philosophy can empower them.
