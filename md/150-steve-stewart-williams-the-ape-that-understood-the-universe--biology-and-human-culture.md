Dr. Steve Stewart-Williams is Associate Professor of Psychology at Nottingham University Malaysia Campus. His research revolves around the idea that theories from evolutionary biology can shed light on human psychology. In particular, he’s interested in the evolutionary origins of altruistic behavior and human sex differences. He also has a long-standing interest in the philosophical implications of evolutionary theory. He’s also the author of the books Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life (2010) and The Ape That Understood the Universe (2018).

In this episode, our conversation centers on some of the main topics of Dr. Stewart-Williams’ most recent book, The Ape That Understood the Universe. We first go through some of the basics of modern evolutionary theory and evolutionary biology, like units and levels of selection, and sexual selection, and also establish the relationship between biology and culture at the same time. Then, we discuss the origins of sex differences, and psychological traits as part of our phenotype. We also refer to the problem with using the term “gender” in science. We then talk about the model MMC (Mutual Mate Choice) in human sexual selection, and if there is any preferred mating system in human societies, like monogamy or polygamy. Toward the end, we talk about the evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral environments and our modern industrialized scientific societies, and how to approach the study of religion from a biological/evolutionary standpoint.
