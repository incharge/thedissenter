Dr. Diana Fleischman completed a PhD in Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, US, under the supervision of David Buss. She is currently a senior lecturer of Psychology at the University of Portsmouth, as well as a member of the Comparative and Evolutionary Psychology group there. Her research interests are hormonal influences on behavior, human sexuality, disgust and, recently, the interface of evolutionary psychology and behaviorism.

In this episode, we talk about the evolutionary psychology of sex robots, and how they might impact men and human society. We talk about why men will be the primary marketing targets, and the several different ways sex robots might have a positive impact in their lives. During the discussion, we also tackle arguments against sex robots, or arguments that suggest their impact might be net negative.
