Dr. Cristina Baciu is Research Program Manager at Arizona State University, Co-Founder and Co-Director at the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center, ACE Scholars Program, and Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Cooperation Scholars Program. Her research interests include mentoring in higher education (undergraduate and graduate students); technology and higher education; barriers to students’ success such as food and housing insecurity; the language of cancer - how do we talk, or not, about cancer and what does that mean for various patients, families, and physicians; and science communication and outreach - how do we communicate clearly about our research findings to reach and benefit a broader audience and the general public.

In this episode, we talk about e-mentoring. We talk about what it is, and how old it is in academia. We talk about how teaching and learning occur online, what predicts the success of e-mentoring, and the advantages and disadvantages of e-mentoring. We also talk about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on e-mentoring and how it is studied. Finally, we discuss some of the biggest barriers to students’ success, including food and housing insecurity.
