RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 19th 2020.  
Dr. Stefaan Blancke is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Tilburg University, Netherlands. He studies the diffusion of (pseudo)scientific beliefs from an epidemiological perspective. His research focuses on the psychological and environmental factors that shape and constrain the development and distribution of these beliefs in the history and philosophy of science, science education and the public understanding of science. He is also interested in the philosophy of cultural evolution and the role of reasons in cultural phenomena such as science, morality and the self.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of science. We focus on the demarcation problem, the scientific method, and how to distinguish science from pseudoscience. We also talk about the evolutionary bases of pseudoscience, and how cultural attraction theory applies to the diffusion of pseudoscientific and scientific beliefs. We discuss if evolutionary psychology is really a science. Finally, we talk a little bit about selves as cultural attractors.
