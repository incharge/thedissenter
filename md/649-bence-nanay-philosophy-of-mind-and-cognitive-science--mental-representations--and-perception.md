RECORDED ON APRIL 26th 2022.  
Dr. Bence Nanay is Professor of Philosophy and BOF Research Professor at the University of Antwerp and has worked as a film critic. He is co-director of the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University of Antwerp. He is a cognitive scientist and philosopher of mind, working on perception, attention, mental imagery and action. He also works on topics in aesthetics.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of mind and cognitive science. We start by discussing their relationship, and the role of experimental philosophy. We then get into mental representations, what they are, and why cognitive science needs them. We get deep into perception, what it is, how it works, how different modes of perception influence one another, the relationship between cognition and perception, the difference between perceptual content and mental imagery, and how action influences perception.
