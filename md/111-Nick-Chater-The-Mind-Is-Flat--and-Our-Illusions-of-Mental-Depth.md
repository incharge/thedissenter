Dr. Nick Chater is Professor of Behavioural Science at Warwick Business School. He works on rationality and language using a range of theoretical and experimental approaches. He has over 200 publications, has won four national awards for psychological research, and has served as Associate Editor for the journals Cognitive Science, Psychological Review, and Psychological Science. He was elected a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society in 2010 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 2012. Dr. Chater is co-founder of the research consultancy Decision Technology, and is on the advisory board of the Cabinet Office's Behavioural Insight Team (BIT). He’s also the author of “The Mind is Flat: The Illusion of Mental Depth and The Improvised Mind”.  
In this episode, the conversation revolves around the main topics of Dr. Chater’s book, The Mind is Flat. We talk about the many illusions that compose our minds, from the way we interpret other people’s behavior and our own, to the attribution of desires, motivations and goals to it. We also discuss how our cognition works, and how our perceptual systems process information. Other topics include the lack of correspondence between our representations and the things outside in the world; how we interpret emotions; the issue about preferences and personality; why we still need our mental illusions to function properly; and if AI systems can also acquire them, namely emotions and consciousness.
