In this episode, we talk about sex differences in cognitive abilities, some issues we have to take into account, the biopsychosocial model, and the biological and social aspects of “gender”. We also refer to the gender wage gap, and striking a balance between one’s professional and personal lives, and if the proposal of going back to same-sex schooling has any merit. Finally, we talk about critical thinking, the types of skills that it involves, how we can teach them to people (children and adults), and about creativity.
