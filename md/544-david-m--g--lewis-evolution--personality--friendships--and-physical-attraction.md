RECORDED ON JULY 27th 2021.  
Dr. David Lewis is Senior Lecturer in Social Psychology at Murdoch University. 

In this episode, we talk about personality, friendship, and attractiveness from an evolutionary perspective. We start with personality, and ask how we should understand it from an evolutionary standpoint, and discuss if there is a personality inventory that would make more sense evolutionarily-speaking. We also discuss if personality traits are adaptations. We talk about the condition-dependent model of individual differences. We then get into friendship, and discuss it as an evolved phenomenon, same-sex and opposite-sex friendships, the phenomenon of friends with benefits, and the relationships straight women establish with gay men. Finally, we discuss several aspects of physical attractiveness, including symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, neotenous facial features, eyes, lumbar curvature, and the effects of wearing high heels. We wrap things up with what we get from studying attractiveness through dating apps.
