Dr. Anna Vedel is PhD and Postdoc in the Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences at Aarhus University, Denmark. Her research areas are in individual differences, personality, academic performance, and study choices. 

In this episode, we talk about how personality traits and individual differences influence educational, occupational and life choices. First, we discuss current personality inventories, particularly the Big Five, and their scientific basis and validity. Then, we get into issues related to the gender equality paradox, and how the differences between men and women in personality and educational and career choices exacerbate in countries that are more gender equal. We talk about findings in personality differences across academic majors, and also about the personality traits that are the most stable across lifespan, but also the ones that change a bit.
