In this episode, we talk about a recent paper - Politics and Academic Values in Higher Education: Just How Much Does Political Orientation Drive the Values of the Ivory Tower?  We first talk about academic values, particularly academic rigor, academic freedom, student emotional well-being, social justice, and the advancement of knowledge. We then get into the story behind the publication of the paper, Jonathan Haidt’s talk at New Paltz, what led to the study it, how the study was designed, among other aspects of the process. We discuss the conclusions of the paper, and we end by talking about how academia should deal with these academic values and the biases that arise from personality, political orientation, gender, and field of expertise.
