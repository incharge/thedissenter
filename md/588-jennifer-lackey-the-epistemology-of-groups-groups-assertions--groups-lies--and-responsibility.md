RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 4th 2021.  
Dr. Jennifer Lackey is Wayne and Elizabeth Jones Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University. Jennifer Lackey specializes in epistemology, with a particular emphasis on a broad range of issues in social epistemology. Her recent work focuses on false confessions, the criminal justice system, the duty to object, norms of credibility, the epistemic status of punishment, the epistemology of groups, expertise, and the distribution of epistemic goods. She is the author of several books, including The Epistemology of Groups.

In this episode, we talk about The Epistemology of Groups. We first get into basic questions in the epistemology of groups, like what is a group, individual and collective levels of analysis, and group agency. We discuss how to attribute moral responsibility to groups and individuals. We talk about beliefs, what they are from a group perspective, and what justifies them. We talk about social knowledge, group assertions, and group lies, and how to distinguish between individual and group lies. Finally, we discuss epistemic phenomena that the epistemology of groups sheds new light on, and future research on the epistemology of groups.
