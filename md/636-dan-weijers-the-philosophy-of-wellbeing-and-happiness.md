RECORDED ON MARCH 10th 2022.  
Dr. Dan Weijers is a permanent Senior Lecturer in the Philosophy Programme at the University of Waikato, in New Zealand. His research specialties include normative ethics (especially hedonism, wellbeing, and experimental normative ethics), applied ethics (especially the ethics of prediction markets; e.g. PredictIt), and interdisciplinary happiness/wellbeing research (especially wellbeing and public policy, philosophy of happiness science, and conceptions of happiness).

In this episode, we talk about wellbeing and happiness. We start with some definitions, and then get into topics like the factors behind wellbeing, and cross-cultural differences in how people think about happiness. We ask if philosophers and religious people are happier. We talk about public policies that target wellbeing, focusing on New Zealand. We discuss hedonism, and Robert Nozick’s experience machine. Finally, we ask if wellbeing can be taught.
