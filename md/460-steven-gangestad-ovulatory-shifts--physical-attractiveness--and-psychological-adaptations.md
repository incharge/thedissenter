RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 3rd 2021.  
Dr. Steven Gangestad is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of New Mexico. His research interests include social behavior; interpersonal relationships; social/personality psychology; psychopathology; and health related behavior, as informed by Evolutionary Psychology.

In this episode, we talk about ovulatory shifts, physical attractiveness, and psychological adaptations and exaptations. We start with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis, and the several controversies surrounding it, and what we know and do not know about ovulation and its psychological effects on women. We talk about the evolution of human physical attractiveness. Toward the end, we discuss the best way to understand the evolution of phenotypic traits, and adaptationist and exaptationist programs. Finally, we discuss the relationship between life history theory and evolutionary psychology.
