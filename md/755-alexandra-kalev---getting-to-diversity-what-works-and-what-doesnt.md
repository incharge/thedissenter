RECORDED ON MARCH 1st 2023.  
Dr. Alexandra Kalev is Associate Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Tel Aviv University. She is developing an evidence-based approach to managing diversity in corporations and universities. She is the author, together with Frank Dobbin, of Getting to Diversity: What Works and What Doesn't.

In this episode, we focus on Getting to Diversity. We start by discussing what a diversity program is, and its different types. We talk about bias. We discuss if current diversity programs work. We get into harassment training programs, and discuss if diversity programs can backfire, and if they can get rigged. We talk about how to keep track of progress. We talk about targeted recruitment programs. We discuss the role of mentoring, teams, and employee resource groups. We discuss which types of training work best, and how they can be democratized. We also talk about work-life struggles, and the role of diversity managers. Finally, we summarize the principles that make diversity programs work.
