RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 29th, 2019.  
Dr. Mattia Riccardi is Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Porto. He does work in the areas of philosophy of mind, Nietzsche’s philosophy, Kant’s philosophy, 19th-century German philosophy, phenomenology, philosophy of perception, and philosophy of action.

In this episode, we focus mostly on Nietzsche’s psychology and epistemology. We talk about his thoughts on free will, consciousness, and introspection. We also discuss Nietzschean drives, and if they are homuncular. We also refer to his views on the embodied mind. Finally, we address his views on Kant’s metaphysics and epistemology, and his critique of the noumenon and of the notion of the “Thing In Itself”.
