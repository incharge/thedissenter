RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 10th 2021.  
Thomas Costello is a Ph.D. Candidate at Emory University. Certain personality traits, thinking styles, and worldviews give rise to maladaptive political attitudes and behaviors, such as violence, extreme partisanship, and authoritarianism. Thomas’ research leverages the tools and expertise of personality psychology and clinical science to understand, measure, and statistically model the psychological causes and correlates of these attitudes and behaviors.

In this episode, we talk about political attitudes, authoritarianism, and sexual objectification. We discuss maladaptive and pathological political attitudes and behaviors, and what distinguishes psychologically left-wing from right-wing people. We dissect authoritarianism, its affective and cognitive components, beliefs and motivational values associated with it, both on the left and the right. We also ask why left-wing authoritarianism has been so neglected in political psychology. Finally, we talk about sexual objectification, and the personality traits and sex differences associated with it.
