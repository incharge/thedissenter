Dr. Susan Blackmore is a psychologist, lecturer and writer researching consciousness, memes, and anomalous experiences, and a Visiting Professor at the University of Plymouth. She is best known for her book The Meme Machine, and has written or contributed to over 40 books, mostly on consciousness.

In this episode, we focus on memetics. First, Dr. Blackmore gives a proper definition of memetics, and then we talk about some specific criticisms, some of them coming from my interviews with Drs. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, namely units of culture, and memes as viruses. We briefly discuss free will, and then move on to talk about imitation as the basis for memetics, and other cognitive mechanisms that an animal needs to have culture and memes. Toward the end, we also talk about how new technologies, like the internet, are changing the way memetics works.
