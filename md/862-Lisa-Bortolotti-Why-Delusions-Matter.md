Dr. Lisa Bortolotti is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham, affiliated with the Philosophy Department in the School of Philosophy, Theology, and Religion; and with the Institute for Mental Health in the School of Psychology.

This is our second talk. You can watch the first one, on The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs, here: https://youtu.be/v13m30R_xbY

In this episode, we focus on Why Delusions Matter. We start by defining delusions, and the criteria used to classify them. We discuss if there are different types of delusions, and if the term “delusion” is problematic. We talk about what we learn about human cognition by studying delusions, the epistemic needs they fulfill, personal identity, their social component, and their costs and benefits to speakers and interpreters. We discuss how delusions exemplify the strengths of human cognition, and implications for social and political epistemology. Finally, we talk about creating better epistemic environments, and the issue of epistemic responsibility.
