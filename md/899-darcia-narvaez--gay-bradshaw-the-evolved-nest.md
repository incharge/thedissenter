Dr. Darcia Narvaez is a Professor of Psychology Emerita at the University of Notre Dame. She has written extensively on issues of character and moral development. Dr. Narvaez’ research explores questions of species-typical and species-atypical development in terms of wellbeing, morality, and sustainable wisdom. She examines how early life experience (the evolved nest) influences moral functioning and wellbeing.   
Dr. Gay A. Bradshaw is a psychologist and ecologist, and director of The Kerulos Center for Nonviolence. Her work focuses on animal trauma recovery and wildlife self-determination. She is the author of Elephants on the Edge: What Animals Teach Us about Humanity, an award-winning book on PTSD in elephants.  
They are both authors of The Evolved Nest: Nature's Way of Raising Children and Creating Connected Communities.

In this episode, we focus on The Evolved Nest. We start by discussing what an “evolved nest” is. We talk about mothers and allomothers; the importance of physical contact; the role of elders and fathers; attachment theory; children’s needs; and the impact of early life experiences. We discuss the effects of individualistic values in modern industrialized societies. Finally, we talk about what we can learn from traditional societies and non-human animals.
