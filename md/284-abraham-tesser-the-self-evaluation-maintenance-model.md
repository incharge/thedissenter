RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 11th, 2019.  
Dr. Abraham Tesser is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Georgia. His research has made significant contributions to several areas in the field of Social Psychology. He created the self-evaluation maintenance model, a theory in social psychology that focuses on the motives for self-enhancement.

In this episode, we talk about the self-evaluation maintenance model. We refer to how it helps us better understand how people navigate their personal relationships, and how they compare themselves to others. We also discuss things like the “self”, self-esteem, and personal growth. Toward the end, Dr. Tesser also speculates a bit on how self-evaluation might have evolved in our species.
