RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 25th 2023.  
Dr. Sarah Hart is an Emerita Professor of Mathematics at Birkbeck, University of London. Educated at Oxford and Manchester, Dr. Hart is also the thirty-third Gresham Professor of Geometry, the first woman to hold the position since its inception in 1597. She is the author of Once Upon a Prime: The Wondrous Connections Between Mathematics and Literature.

In this episode, we focus on Once Upon a Prime. We talk about the connection between mathematics and literature in several different dimensions, including the structure of literary texts; poetry, and rhyme schemes; plots and narrative choices in novels; numbers used in fiction; turns of phrase, metaphors, and allusions; mathematical themes, and stereotypes of mathematicians; and the idea of mathematics itself. Finally, we discuss the messages of the book.
