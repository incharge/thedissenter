RECORDED ON MAY 4th 2020.  
Dr. Peter Jonason is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Padova, Italy. By training he is a social/personality psychologist who uses evolutionary theory to derive predictions and account for observable phenomena in (mostly) personality, individual differences, mating strategies, and sexuality.

In this episode, we focus on human mating behavior. We first talk about the relationship between the Dark Triad traits and mating behavior, and also the costs associated with them. Then we go through some specific topics, like the willingness to get caught in an extra-pair relationship, the mate preferences of educated people, and what we can learn about human mating by studying the booty call. Finally, we talk about some of the psychological barriers to accepting findings in evolutionary psychology.
