This is our second talk. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/04yvn-B7vRg

In this episode, we talk about dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We start by discussing the differences between computational-representational approaches and dynamical approaches in cognitive science. We talk about 4E cognition. We then get into a recent paper by Dr. Hipólito, Mind as Motion, and talk about a shift in psychology towards dynamical approaches, and the role of the sociocultural context. We discuss if psychological experiences have any intrinsic value, and if science is value-free or independent of any sociocultural context. Finally, we discuss if AI systems can become human-like if they are not embodied.
