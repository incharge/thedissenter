Jordan Moss is a psychology graduate and medical student at the University of Sydney. He has research interests in individual differences, with particular interest in personality theory and moral psychology.

In this episode, we talk about the alt-right and the Politically Correct left.  We start by characterizing the alt-right, and the move on to the political correctness authoritarians and liberals. We talk about the psychological differences and similarities between the al-right and the PC folks. We discuss the personality traits of people on the left and the right. We talk about environmental factors that might explain political extremism. Finally, we discuss how social media use might have an impact on political attitudes.
