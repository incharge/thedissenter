Dr. Jean-François Bonnefon (PhD, cognitive psychology) is a Research Director at the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, affiliated to the Toulouse School of Economics, the Toulouse School of Management, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse. He holds the Moral AI chair at the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute, and is the president of the European Commission expert group on the ethics of driverless mobility. He conducts research on decisions which have a moral component, especially in the context of machine ethics and human-AI cooperation. His research appeared in 100+ academic articles, in outlets that include Science, Nature, and PNAS.

In this episode, we talk about morality from a cognitive science perspective, machine behavior, and moral machines. First, we discuss the role of trust, universals and variations in moral decisions, selfish hedonic maximizers. We then get into issues related to how intrasexual competition affects moral behavior. Finally, we talk about machine behavior, moral machines, and machines as social catalysts, with special focus on autonomous vehicles.
