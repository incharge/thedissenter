RECORDED ON MAY 30th 2024.  
Dr. Gwendolyn Dolske is Professor of Philosophy at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and host of the Good Is In The Details Podcast - @goodisinthedetialspodcast

In this episode, we start by talking about why philosophy is important for people’s lives, and the Good Is In The Details podcast. We then explore the philosophy of existentialism and the work of Simone de Beauvoir. We discuss her importance in the history of feminism, the link between existentialism and feminism, what it means to become a woman, what authenticity is, and what it means to live a “good life”. We also talk about the role of sex and love for humans. We discuss modern dating, the manosphere, and the backlash against feminism. Finally, we talk about sex work from a feminist perspective.
