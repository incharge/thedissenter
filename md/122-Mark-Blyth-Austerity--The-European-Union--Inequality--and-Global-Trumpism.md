Dr. Mark Blyth is William R. Roads Professor of International Economics at Brown University. His research interests lie in the field of international political economy. More specifically, his research trespasses several fields and aims to be as interdisciplinary as possible, drawing from political science, economics, sociology, complexity theory, and evolutionary theory. His work falls into several related areas: the politics of ideas, how institutions change, political parties, and the politics of finance. He’s also the author of books like Great Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century, and Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea.

In this episode, we talk about the origins of the economic idea of austerity, and its development over history. We also tackle the notion of ordoliberalism, and how it connects with Germany, and how the European Union was economically structured. How the 70’s stagflation and the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 changed the course of economics and politics. And also what Dr. Blyth calls the phenomenon of Global Trumpism, and political populism on both the right and the left. We finish up by talking a bit about current economic issues, notably economic inequality in the West and global warming, and how to deal with them.
