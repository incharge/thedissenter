RECORDED ON JANUARY 19th 2021.  
Dr. Menelaos Apostolou is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Nicosia, Cyprus. He was born in Athens, Greece and he completed his post-graduate and graduate studies in the United Kingdom. He has published several peer-reviewed papers, books and chapters in books in the area of evolutionary psychology. He’s the author of a new book, The Evolution of Same-Sex Attraction.

This is my second interview with Dr. Apostolou, where we focus on The Evolution of Same-Sex attraction. We start by discussing the evolution of sexual reproduction, and we talk a lot about sexual attraction (its evolution; if it occurs on a continuum; if it is fluid; and the genetic basis and possible environmental factors behind its development, including the fraternal birth order effect). We talk about homosexuality in ancient societies, and in hunter-gatherer societies. We discuss tolerance and intolerance of same-sex attraction. Dr. Apostolou presents his Weak Negative Selection Pressures and Positive Selection Pressures Hypotheses for the high prevalence of same-sex attraction in human societies. We also talk about why men prefer women who like other women. We discuss a hypothesis for why the Catholic Church is intolerant toward same-sex relations. We ask why Western societies are tolerant of same-sex attraction, and how it will evolve in the future. Finally, we discuss if people can apply this knowledge to develop a better understanding of their own sexual attraction and their relationships.
