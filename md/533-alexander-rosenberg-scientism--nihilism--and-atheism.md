In this episode, we talk about scientism. We start by defining scientism, and its relationship to science. We go through many different questions like “What is reality?”, the evolution of human psychology, purpose and meaning, belief, consciousness, free will, God, the nature of morality, and moral progress. We talk about nihilism, and its relationship with scientism. Finally, we discuss how scientism could apply to the social sciences, how to deal with the humanities, and atheism.
