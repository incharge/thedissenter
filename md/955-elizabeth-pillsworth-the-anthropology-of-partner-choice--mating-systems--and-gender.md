RECORDED ON APRIL 4th 2024.  
Dr. Elizabeth Pillsworth is Professor of Anthropology at the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at California State University, Fullerton. Her research questions include patterns of mate preferences, mate choice, sexuality, gender, romantic love, and reproduction. Her research projects include studies with U.S. populations and 15 years of fieldwork with an indigenous hunter-horticultural population in Amazonian Ecuador.

In this episode, we explore the evolutionary anthropology of partner choice, parenthood, mating systems, and gender. We start by talking about the Shuar people in South America, and we explore topics like their gender norms and how they have changed over the past few decades; partner choice and marital practices; parent-offspring conflict in partner choice; and the influence of female choice and parental choice in the evolution of mate preferences. We then talk about the evolution of paternal investment and the role of fathers. We discuss coupling and human mating systems. Finally, we talk about the difference between sex and gender, and how gender roles change across time.
