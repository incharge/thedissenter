Dr. Pascal Boyer is the Henry Luce Professor of Individual and Collective Memory in the Departments of Psychology and Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis. He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Lyon, France. He’s also the author of books like Religion Explained; Memory, Mind and Culture; and Minds Make Societies.

In this episode, we focus mostly on the main topics of Minds Make Societies. We start off by talking about how we need to know how minds work if we want to understand how humans create societies. To set things off, we also refer to core knowledge, and to the flaws in the psychological literature on biases and heuristics. We then get into how human politics evolved, and the common threads that we find from small-scale hunter-gatherer and horticultural tribes to complex large-scale state societies. We also go over the evolution of gender roles, and their relationship with politics (patriarchy). In the last part of the conversation, we discuss the evolutionary psychology of religion, and some of the methodological problems with its approach. And we wrap it up with a question from my patron, Yzar Wehbe, about conspiratorial thinking.
