Dr. Russell T. Warne is Associate Professor of Psychology at Utah Valley University. His new book is In the Know: Debunking 35 Myths About Human Intelligence.

You can watch our first talk here: https://youtu.be/c9owI60ucNg

In this episode, the topic of conversation is Dr. Warne’s new book, In the Know. We cover some of the major topics of the book, including: g and IQ; what general intelligence is; if IQ tests only work in the West, and are culture-specific; the evolution of general intelligence; the neuroscience of IQ, and the P-FIT model; if there any multiple intelligences, and we focus on Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences, Daniel Goleman’s emotional intelligence, and Stenberg’s practical intelligence; the behavioral genetics of intelligence; environmental factors that influence IQ; social and educational interventions to raise IQ; explanations for the Flynn effect; problems with the education system; the idea that everyone should go to college; the lives of low-IQ people; sex differences; race differences; eugenics; a g-informed education system; and predictions at the individual level, particularly in regards to educational attainment.
