Dr. Robert Plomin is Professor of Behavioural Genetics at the Social Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Center at King’s College London, and Research Professor at the Medical Research Council (MRC). He’s one of the leading figures in the entire field of Behavioral Genetics. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Dr. Plomin as the 71st most cited psychologist of the 20th century. And he’s also the author of many books, including Behavioral Genetics: A Primer (1989), Separate Lives: Why Siblings Are So Different (1992), Nature And Nurture: An Introduction To Human Behavioral Genetics (2004), Nature and Nurture During Infancy and Early Childhood (2006), G Is for Genes (2013), and, the most recent one, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are (2018).

In this episode, we start off by talking about the history and development of the field of Behavioral Genetics. We also address the issue of environmentalism in Psychology and the behavioral sciences. We also go through some of the basic concepts in Behavioral Genetics, like heritability, gene-environment correlations, and twin and adoptee studies. We also tackle the problems with environmental factors in human behavior. We also deal with GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies), polygenic scores and the type of information we can obtain from them and what we can do with it. We also talk about how clinical psychology and psychiatry should revise the way they classify mental conditions, moving from a qualitative to a quantitative approach, and some of the current limitations in these fields. Toward the end, we also briefly discuss the potential of gene editing technologies.
