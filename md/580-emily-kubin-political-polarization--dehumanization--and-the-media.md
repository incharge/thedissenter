RECORDED ON OCTOBER 11th 2021.  
Emily Kubin is a PhD student in the Political Psychology & Communication Lab at the University of Koblenz-Landau (at Landau). She studies political communication. Specifically, she focuses on how political opponents view and interact with one another, and the role media play in opponents’ perceptions of one another. She places a special focus on studying strategies political opponents (and the media) can use to reduce affective polarization.

In this episode, we talk about affective polarization and the role played by the media; where liberals and conservatives differ the most in terms of their political attitudes; the role personal experiences and facts play in political disagreements, and the situations where personal experiences might elicit respect from political opponents; political dehumanization, and interventions to reduce it; and interventions to reduce political polarization.
