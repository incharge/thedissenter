RECORDED ON AUGUST 26th 2020.  
Dr. Paul Eastwick is Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Eastwick’s research investigates how people initiate romantic relationships and the psychological mechanisms that help romantic partners to remain committed and attached. One of his research programs examines how the qualities that people say are critically important to them in a romantic partner—their ideal partner preferences—direct romantic partner selection and retention. He is also interested in exploring how close relationships research can inform evolutionary psychological approaches (and vice versa), especially with respect to the way that relationships grow and develop over time.

In this episode, we talk about close relationships, and the interrelation between relationship science and evolutionary psychology. Topics include pair-bonding; short-term and long-term relationships; what we can learn from speed-dating studies; the Relationship Coordination and Strategic Timing (ReCAST) Model; and what males relationships last, and if people are good at predicting how romantic breakups will affect them emotionally.
