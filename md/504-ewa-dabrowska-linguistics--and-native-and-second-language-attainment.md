RECORDED ON APRIL 27th 2021.  
Dr. Ewa Dabrowska is Professor at Friedrich Alexander University, Erlangen, and in the Department of English Language and Linguistics at Birmingham University. Her research interests include cognitive linguistics, language acquisition, the mental status of rules, and individual differences in linguistic knowledge. She has published monographs on the semantics of case and the relationship between linguistics and other disciplines studying language, and numerous articles. She is the editor of Cognitive Linguistics and Vice President of the UK Cognitive Linguistics Association.

In this episode, we talk about linguistics. We start by covering some of the most prominent theories of language, including nativism, constructivism, and functional theories. We then discuss several aspects of native language attainment, and also how people acquire second languages. We discuss specifically the role of education and inputs. Finally, we discuss the “poverty of the stimulus” argument for nativism.
