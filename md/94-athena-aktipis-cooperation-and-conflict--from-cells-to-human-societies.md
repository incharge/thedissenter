Dr. Athena Aktipis is Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at Arizona State University, co-Director of the Human Generosity Project and Director of Human and Social Evolution, and co-founder of the Center for Evolution and Cancer at the University of California, San Francisco. She is a cooperation theorist, theoretical evolutionary biologist, and cancer biologist who now works at the intersection of these fields. She will be having a book coming out in the near future, Evolution in the Flesh: Cancer and the Transformation of Life.

In this episode, we talk about what game theory is, and how it works; conflict between the mother and the fetus in the womb; walk away vs the traditional tit-for-tat cooperative strategies; the osotua system of the Masai, a need-based cooperative system; principles that rule interactions from the cellular to the societal levels, and how they can be applied to develop better tools to fight cancer.
