RECORDED ON JUNE 8th 2021.  
Dr. Jaimie Krems is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Oklahoma State University. Dr. Krems is a social psychologist with interdisciplinary training. Her research draws on theoretical perspectives from social psychology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology and anthropology, as well as animal behavior to investigate how people use cues to strategically navigate their social worlds and meet their social goals. 

In this episode, we talk about female friendships, stereotypes and prejudice, and religion and monogamy. We first get into the evolution of female sociality, and how female establish friendships among themselves. We talk about aggression in friendships, and social factors that influence levels of aggression, like economic inequality and sex ratios. We discuss the evolutionary bases of stereotypes and prejudice, with a focus on the stereotypes people hold about women who have casual sex. Finally, we talk about the relationship between preferred mating strategies and religiosity, and anti-atheist prejudice.
