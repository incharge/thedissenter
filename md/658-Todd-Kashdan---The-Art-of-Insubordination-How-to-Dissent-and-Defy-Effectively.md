RECORDED ON MAY 9th 2022.  
Dr. Todd Kashdan is Professor of Psychology at George Mason University. He has been named Distinguished Faculty Member of the Year at George Mason University and received the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology. His new book is The Art of Insubordination: How to Dissent and Defy Effectively.

In this episode, we focus on The Art of Insubordination. We start by defining insubordination. We discuss conformity, its relationship to personality and intelligence, and the Asch and Milgram studies. We talk about principled insubordination, and what characterizes it. We discuss the benefits of conformity. We talk about the nature and nurture aspects behind being a dissenter. We discuss how to be a successful subordinate, how to seek allies, and how to deal with distress. We talk about what rebels should do when they acquire power, if they do not want to become tyrannical themselves. We discuss how to create a culture that promotes viewpoint diversity. We talk about the benefits of having insubordinates in society. Finally, we discuss when insubordination is too much.
