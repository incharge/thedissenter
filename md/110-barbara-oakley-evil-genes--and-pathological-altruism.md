SORRY ABOUT THE VIDEO ISSUES. 

Dr. Barbara Oakley is a Professor of Engineering at Oakland University. She is involved in multiple areas of research, ranging from STEM education, to engineering education, to learning practices. Her work focuses on the complex relationship between neuroscience and social behavior. She has published in outlets as varied as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. Her research has been described as “revolutionary” in the Wall Street Journal. She’s the author of Evil Genes: Why Rome Fell, Hitler Rose, Enron Failed, and My Sister Stole My Mother's Boyfriend, and the editor of Pathological Altruism.

In this episode, I talk with Dr. Oakley about some of the topics of her books, and particularly about pathological altruism, its many manifestations, and its relation to empathy. We also talk a bit about psychopathy, and other negative psychological traits, and their innate and developmental aspects.
