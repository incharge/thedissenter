Dr. Justin L. Barrett is Professor of Psychology at Fuller Graduate School of Psychology and Chief Project Developer for the Office for Science, Theology and Religion Iniciatives at Fuller Theological Seminary. Professor Barrett is regarded as one of the founders of the cognitive science of religion field. He’s also the author of books like Why Would Anyone Believe in God?, Cognitive Science, Religion, and Theology: From Human Minds to Divine Minds, and Born Believers: The Science of Children's Religious Belief.

This is another episode about the cognitive science of religion. First, we discuss the aspects of religion that science can tackle and determine as right or wrong. After that, we briefly establish what a “belief” is. Then, we refer to some of the main cognitive mechanisms and aspects of child development associated with religious thinking. We also discuss if religion is better understood as a by-product of evolution or an adaptation itself. Toward the end, we talk about John Calvin’s sensus divinitatis, and also how the New Atheists tend to oversimplify religion.
