He teaches undergraduate courses in Developmental Psychology, Cyberpsychology, and Psychology of Language, and a graduate course in Cognition and Culture. He supervises several graduate students researching children’s social and moral development. His research centers on children’s and adolescents’ everyday communication online.

In this episode, we first talk about children’s social development, with particular focus on how they develop/acquire norms and start caring about norm violation. In the second part, we discuss the emerging field of cyberpsychology, the differences between the virtual and the real worlds, and also cyberbullying.
