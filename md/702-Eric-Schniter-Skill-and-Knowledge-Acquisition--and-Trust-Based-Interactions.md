Dr. Eric Schniter is a Lecturer in Anthropology at California State University, Fullerton, and a Visiting Research Associate at the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University. Dr. Schniter does research in evolutionary anthropology, behavioral economics, and evolutionary psychology. He has been examining the development of skill, knowledge, and material production across the lifespan. This work has led him to investigate relationship maintenance, which is central to fostering material and knowledge transfers over the life course. Finally, Dr. Schniter is interested in how emotions calibrate personal and interpersonal behaviors, contributing to relationship maintenance and well-being.

In this episode, we talk about skill and knowledge acquisition, and trust-based interactions. We start by talking about the acquisition of skill, knowledge, and material production across the lifespan in foraging societies. We also discuss ethnobiological knowledge, sex differences in knowledge acquisition and specialization, and storytelling skills. We then get into how human relationships are maintained, with a focus on trust. We discuss how promises, apologies, and confessions build and rebuild trust. We talk about dishonesty and mistrust, and gender stereotypes associated with them. We talk about trust games, and what we can learn from them. Finally, we discuss the role that risk plays in the evolution of human exchange.
