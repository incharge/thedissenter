RECORDED ON March 20th, 2020.  
Dr. Hugo Mercier is a research scientist at the CNRS – Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Institut Jean Nicod), where he works with the Evolution and Social Cognition team. Most of his work so far has focused on the function and workings of reasoning. He’s the author of The Enigma of Reason, and, more recently, Not Born Yesterday: The Science of Who We Trust and What We Believe.

In this episode, we center on Dr. Mercier’s recent book, Not Born Yesterday. He walks us through the recent science that goes against the prevailing narrative in social psychology, that we are extremely gullible, and easily manipulated and deceived. We explore examples in the domains of politics, social media, science, and others.
