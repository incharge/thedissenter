In this episode, we talk about what we can learn about human psychology through written language. We first discuss the functions of language, and how it influences cognition. We get into written language, and the psychological benefits of writing, particularly expressive writing. We also talk about predicting relationship breakdowns through language use, personality traits, stories, and sex differences in language use.
