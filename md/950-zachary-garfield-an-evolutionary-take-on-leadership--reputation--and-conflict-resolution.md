RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 27th 2023.  
Dr. Zachary Garfield is Assistant Professor at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in the Faculty of Governance, Economics and Social Sciences, and co-director of The Omo Valley Research Project. He investigates how behaviors such as leadership and followership, social learning, decision-making, and economic strategies are related to group-level pressures stemming from, for example, social contexts, network dynamics, political structures, and cultural norms.

In this episode, we start by talking about leadership from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss how to identify a leader, hypotheses for the evolution of leadership, whether it is an evolved adaptation, how leadership works in small-scale egalitarian societies, the social functions of leaders and their psychological traits, and how societies transition to more inequality and how leaders become more coercive. We also talk about the universal and variable dimensions of leadership across societies, and differences between men and women leaders. We then discuss reputation and different reputation domains in human societies, and the different ways people deal with conflict resolution. Finally, we discuss whether leadership correlates with age.
