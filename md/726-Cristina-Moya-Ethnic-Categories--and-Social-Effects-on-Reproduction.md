RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 21st 2022.  
Dr. Cristina Moya is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis. She is an evolutionary anthropologist interested in how humans respond adaptively to culturally structured social worlds. Two main foci of her research are: intergroup interactions and social cognition; and cross-cultural variation in social effects on reproduction.

In this episode, we talk about ethnic categories, and social effects on reproduction. We start by defining ethnic categories, and we talk about their evolutionary bases; the fact that there is no correlation between “race” and culture; stereotyping, essentialism, and ethnocentrism; how people think about ethnic groups; child development; and gene-culture coevolution in ethnic psychology. We then get into social effects on reproduction, with a focus on the impact of family members. We discuss reproduction in industrialized societies; religiosity; and female-dispersing groups, and age at menopause. Finally, we talk about potential explanations for the demographic transition in industrialized societies.
