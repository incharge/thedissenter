RECORDED ON OCTOBER 2nd 2020.  
Dr. Andrew Gallup is Assistant Professor of Psychology and the director of the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) Lab at SUNY Poly. His research spans a variety of topics, including contagious behavior and comparative neuroanatomy, brain thermoregulation and vigilance, collective behavior and social cognition, aggression and sexual conflict, the evolution of cooperation, sports and athletic competition from an evolutionary perspective, biomarkers of Darwinian fitness, and the effects of neuromodulation on adaptive responses.

In this episode, we talk about aggression, and the evolution of yawning. We first tackle the evolutionary bases of aggression, and the social functions that it serves, and how we can apply this knowledge to combat bullying. We mention sex differences, and also how aggression changes across human development, with focus on men and testosterone. We then get into the evolutionary function of yawning, and ask if it really is socially contagious.
