His research interests include adult stem cells, chemical neuroanatomy and circuitry, higher brain functions, and brain imaging. He is the author of The Psychopath Inside: A Neuroscientist's Personal Journey into the Dark Side of the Brain.

In this episode, we talk about psychopathy. We get into what it is, how it is diagnosed, its genetics and neuroscience, and environmental factors. We talk about the nature-nurture debate, and if it is possible to change a psychopath. We discuss if it is possible to predict behavior from brain scans, and if behavior is determined. Finally, we talk about the evolution of psychopathy.
