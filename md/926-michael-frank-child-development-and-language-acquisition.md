In this episode, we talk about child development and language acquisition. We talk about infant-directed speech, pragmatic abilities, and similarity reasoning. We get into why children learn some words earlier than others; how they infer the meaning of words before they begin their formal education; and human universals and variability in language acquisition. We discuss why people use polite language. We talk about the use of eye-tracking and head-mounted cameras to study children’s early social and visual environment. Finally, we discuss parenting attitudes, where they come from, and if they translate into actual parenting behavior.
