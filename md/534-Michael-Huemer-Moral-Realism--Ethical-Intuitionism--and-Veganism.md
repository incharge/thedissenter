Dr. Michael Huemer is a professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado. He is the author of more than seventy academic articles in epistemology, ethics, metaethics, metaphysics, and political philosophy, as well as several books, like Skepticism and the Veil of Perception, Ethical Intuitionism, The Problem of Political Authority, Approaching Infinity, Paradox Lost, and Dialogues on Ethical Vegetarianism.

In this episode, we talk about ethics and veganism. We start by discussing objectivity in ethics, and how we can objectively determine right and wrong. We get into ethical intuitionism, and discuss where our ethical intuitions come from, including their evolutionary bases. We talk about objections to moral nihilism and moral relativism. We talk about the relationship between science and ethics. We then discuss several different questions in animal ethics, including what makes an animal worthy of moral consideration; animal rights, and legislation concerning animal wellbeing; the extinction of the animals from the meat industry; anti-natalism; how we should deal with carnivore species; cannibalism; and if it would be possible for all of us to become vegan.
