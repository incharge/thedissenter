RECORDED ON MARCH 7th 2024.  
Dr. Cat Bohannon is a researcher and author with a Ph.D. from Columbia University in the evolution of narrative and cognition. Her essays and poems have appeared in Scientific American, Mind, Science Magazine, The Best American Nonrequired Reading, The Georgia Review, The Story Collider, and Poets Against the War. She is the author of Eve: How the Female Body Drove 200 Million Years of Human Evolution.

In this episode, we focus on Eve. We start by talking about females from 200 million years ago, going back to the early mammals, and we also talk about the difference between sex and gender, and the “male norm”, or how the female body has been neglected in biology and medicine. We then go through the evolution of some of the traits Dr. Bohannon explores in her book, namely milk, and whether men and trans women con produce it; breasts and sexual selection; the origins of the placenta; the female orgasm; menstruation; female vision and smell; bipedalism and birth; and menopause. Finally, we discuss the origins of sexism and patriarchy.
