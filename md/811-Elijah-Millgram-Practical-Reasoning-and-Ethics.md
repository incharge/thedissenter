In this episode, we talk about practical reasoning. We start by discussing what practical reasoning is, and the questions it applies to. We talk about different theories of practical reasoning, and problems with means-end approaches. We discuss how practical reasoning applies to ethics; Kant’s practical reason; and how practical reasoning relates to virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology. We discuss if ethics is just a matter of preference. We also talk about the ways practical reasoning can be wrong, how it differs from reflective equilibrium, and how to deal with the issue of defeasibility.
