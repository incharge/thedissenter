RECORDED ON DECEMBER 8th 2022.  
Dr. Chad Orzel is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College in Schenectady, NY, where he teaches a wide range of classes, and does research on atomic, molecular, and optical physics. He writes a blog about physics for Forbes.com. He is the author of several books, including Eureka: Discovering Your Inner Scientist, and Breakfast with Einstein: The Exotic Physics of Everyday Objects. His latest book is A Brief History of Timekeeping: The Science of Marking Time, from Stonehenge to Atomic Clocks.

In this episode, we focus on A Brief History of Timekeeping. Topics include: timekeeping as a human universal; what a clock is; using the “movements” of the Sun; using other stars and the moon; how the cycle of the zodiac got invented; how different calendars got created; the influence of politics and religion on timekeeping; the first clocks; how mechanical clocks work; how global empires and astronomy influenced the evolution of clocks; the development of standardized time zones; the ways by which the physical nature of time differ from the human understanding of it; quantum clocks and their applications; and potential new clocks in the future.
