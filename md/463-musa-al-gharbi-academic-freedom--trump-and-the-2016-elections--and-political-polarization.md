RECORDED ON MARCH 16th 2021.  
Dr. Musa al-Gharbi is a Paul F. Lazarsfeld Fellow in the Department of Sociology, and a Mellon-Sawyer Fellow on Trust and Mistrust of Experts for the Interdisciplinary Center on Innovative Theory and Empirics (INCITE), in partnership with the American Assembly, at Columbia University. His research explores how knowledge is produced, transmitted, evaluated and put to use (or not) — and how people’s thinking is shaped by the social contexts they find themselves in. He applies these lenses to a range of topics including race, inequality, social movements, extremism, policing, national security, foreign policy — and more recently — U.S. political elections.

In this episode, we go through several topics on politics and sociology, including: freedom of expression and ideological discrimination in academia, and outside academia; diversity in academia; Trump, who voted for him and why, and the 2016 elections; and the real political polarization we find in society nowadays.
