RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 8th 2022.  
Dr. Eli Alshanetsky is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Temple University. Previously, he was an Andrew W. Mellon fellow in the Humanities at Stanford University. He received his PhD in philosophy from NYU. Dr. Alshanetsky's research and teaching interests are at the intersection of the philosophy of mind and language, epistemology, and cognitive science. He is the author of Articulating a Thought.

In this episode, we focus on Articulating a Thought. We start by talking about self-knowledge, how people acquire it, and how it is approached philosophically. We then get into articulation, and the reasoning behind articulating a thought. We also discuss why some thoughts are easy to articulate, while others are very hard, the limits of language, and clarity of thought.
