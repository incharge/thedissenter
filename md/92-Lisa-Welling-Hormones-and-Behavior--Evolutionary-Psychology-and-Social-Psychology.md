I ONLY HAVE AUDIO FROM DR. WELLING’S SIDE. SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT I HAD SOME SORT OF TECHNICAL ISSUE, AND I COULDN’T RECORD THE VIDEO. 

Dr. Lisa Welling is a tenured Associate Professor at Oakland University, US, and head of The Welling Research Lab there. She was awarded the Oakland University New Investigator Research Excellence Award in 2015, and the Oakland University Outstanding Graduate Mentor Award in 2018. She currently serves on the Editorial Boards for the journals Evolutionary Psychological Science, Evolutionary Psychology, and Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology. She is particularly interested in how hormones affect different aspects of our behavior, including mate choice, preferences, and sexual behavior.

In this episode, we talk about behavioral endocrinology (the way hormones affect our behavior), and evolutionary psychology. We start by going through some basic concepts about endocrinology. Then we go through some differences between men and women in sexual and mating behavior. We finish up with a discussion about how to integrate Evolutionary Psychology and Social Psychology, and also the importance of the former in today’s context.
