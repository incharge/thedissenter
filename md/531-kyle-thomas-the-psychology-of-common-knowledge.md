RECORDED ON JUNE 23rd 2021.  
Dr. Kyle Thomas recently received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology from Harvard University, where he developed his research program on the psychology of common knowledge under his advisor, Steven Pinker. He is currently the Chief Scientist at MotiveMetrics, where they turn cutting-edge psychological science into software tools that can accurately reveal true motivations from publicly available data. In short, they help marketers understand why people buy—or don’t—at the click of a button. Software hasn’t eaten marketing research yet, but they’re working very hard to change that.

In this episode, we talk about common knowledge. We start with some basic definitions of private knowledge, shared knowledge, and common knowledge. We then get into some examples of domains where common knowledge applies, like economic games, self-conscious emotions, charitable behavior, the bystander effect, and indirect speech.
