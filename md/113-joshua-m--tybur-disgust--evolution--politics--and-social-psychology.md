Dr. Joshua M. Tybur is an Associate Professor in the Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology at VU Amsterdam. His work is dedicated to better understanding how people solve some of the fundamental problems of life, including avoiding infectious diseases, obtaining and retaining a mate, and navigating the threats and affordances of interdependence. He approaches these topics with a combination of ideas and techniques from social psychology, personality psychology, and evolutionary biology.

In this episode, I talk with Dr. Tybur about the domains of the emotion of disgust, from an evolutionary perspective; the relationship between disgust and morality, and between disgust and political attitudes; sex differences in disgust sensitivity. We also talk about politics and science, and the problem of our own political preferences contaminating scientific research, and the importance of giving social psychology a biological basis.
