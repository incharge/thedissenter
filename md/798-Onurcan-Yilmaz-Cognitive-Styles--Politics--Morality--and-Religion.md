RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 28th 2023.  
Dr. Onurcan Yilmaz is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Kadir Has University, Istanbul, and he currently leads the Moral Intuitions Laboratory (MINT Lab). He studies the intersection between morality, religion, politics and decision-making from perspectives derived from cognitive and evolutionary psychology and behavioral economics. His research mainly focuses on dual-process accounts of moral judgment and behavior.

In this episode, we talk about cognitive styles, politics, morality, and religion. We start by talking about cognitive styles, and then go through several different links: between cognitive style and political ideology; between analytic thinking and moral foundations; between analytic thinking and economic conservatism; between cognitive style and religiosity; between personality traits and political convictions; between morality and politics; and between morality and religion. We talk about analytic thinking training. We discuss if science can increase moral sensitivity, and if belief in God can be induced in non-believers. We talk about the relationship between cognitive style and normative views, and how psychopathy is related to utilitarianism. Finally, we discuss if people have fixed normative principles.
