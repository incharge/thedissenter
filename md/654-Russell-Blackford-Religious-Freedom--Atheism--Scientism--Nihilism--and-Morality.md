In this episode, we talk about religion, atheism, science, and morality. We start with religious freedom, and the modern secular state. We define atheism, and get into the conflict between religion and science. We then talk about moral authority, the objectivity of morality, moral skepticism, and the relationship between moral nihilism and atheism.
