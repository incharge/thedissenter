RECORDED ON JULY 28th, 2020.  
Dr. David Haig is an evolutionary biologist, geneticist, and professor in Harvard University's Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. He is interested in intragenomic conflict, genomic imprinting and parent–offspring conflict, and wrote the book Genomic Imprinting and Kinship. His major contribution to the field of evolutionary theory is the kinship theory of genomic imprinting. He’s the author of several books, including the most recent one, From Darwin to Derrida: Selfish Genes, Social Selves, and the Meanings of Life.

In this episode, we start off by talking about some basic concepts in evolutionary biology, like what is a gene, units of selection, multi-level selection theory and group selection. We then get into intragenomic conflict, parental antagonism, and parent-offspring conflict. We talk about epigenetics, and development in the context of natural selection from a gene-centered perspective. Finally, we get into some of the topics from Dr. Haig’s latest book, and discuss purpose and meaning.
