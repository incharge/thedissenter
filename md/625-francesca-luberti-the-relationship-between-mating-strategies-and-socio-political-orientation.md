RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 11th 2022.  
Dr. Francesca Luberti has recently completed a PhD at the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES), UNSW Sydney. She is now doing a postdoc in the Social Neuroendocrinology Lab at Nipissing University in Canada. Dr. Luberti does research in Evolutionary Psychology, Evolutionary Biology, Social Psychology, and Biological Anthropology.

In this episode, we talk about the relationship between mating strategies and socio-political orientation, and laughter. We start by defining mating strategies and socio-political orientation. We then get into the relationship between the both of them, and into several of the cues people pick from the mating market that influence their own mating strategies. We discuss why people care about other people’s mating strategies. We talk about how age and gender might influence political orientation. We get into the rationale behind suppressing female sexuality. We talk about support for same-sex rights and for economic issues, like wealth redistribution. We discuss the role of sex ratios. Finally, we talk a bit about laughter.
