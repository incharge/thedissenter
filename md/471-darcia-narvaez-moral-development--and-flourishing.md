Dr. Darcia Narvaez is a Professor of Psychology Emerita at the University of Notre Dame. She has written extensively on issues of character and moral development. Dr. Narvaez’ research explores questions of species-typical and species-atypical development in terms of wellbeing, morality, and sustainable wisdom. She examines how early life experience (the evolved nest) influences moral functioning and wellbeing in children and adults. She integrates evolutionary, anthropological, neurobiological, clinical, developmental and education sciences in her work. Her 2014 book - Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality - won the 2015 William James Book Award from the APA and the 2017 Expanded Reason Award for research.

In this episode, we talk about moral development. First, we define morality, and talk about the concept of the “evolved nest”. We ask if morality is innate, and discuss moral foundations theory and its limitations. We get into moral development, and talk about the role of genetics, the parents, and the wider community. We talk about multiples inheritances genes, epigenetics, developmental plasticity, basic needs, the microbiome, local and macro ecological heritages). We mention the importance of social interaction in child development. We discuss human flourishing, and what we can learn from indigenous societies. Finally, we talk about studying human behavior through a multidisciplinary approach.
