RECORDED ON DECEMBER 23rd 2022.  
Dr. Eric Schwitzgebel is Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Riverside. Most of Dr. Schwitzgebel’s research explores connections between empirical psychology and philosophy of mind, especially the nature of belief, the inaccuracy of our judgments about our stream of conscious experience, and the tenuous relationship between philosophical ethics and actual moral behavior. He also works on classical Chinese philosophy and philosophical science fiction.

In this episode, we talk about beliefs, ethics, and psychology. We start by defining belief. We discuss if we have accurate views of our own beliefs, and if beliefs cause behavior. We talk about how well we really know our own conscious experience, and discuss if introspection is reliable. We then discuss if ethics professors and more moral than other people, if philosophy classes have any effect on the moral behavior of students, and the effects of narrative arguments. We also discuss if philosophy has become more welcoming of women in recent decades, and the relationship between empirical psychology and philosophy.
