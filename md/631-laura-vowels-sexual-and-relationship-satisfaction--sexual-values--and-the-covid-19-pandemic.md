RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 24th 2022.  
Dr. Laura Vowels is an ICEEFT certified emotionally-focused (EFT) therapist and a junior lecturer/postdoctoral researcher at University of Lausanne, Switzerland. She has published extensively on topics pertaining to romantic relationships and sexual desire and well-being. She also works as a principal researcher for Blueheart.io. Blueheart’s mission is to bring sex therapy to millions of couples in an app format to help couples navigate issues around sexual desire discrepancy.

In this episode, we talk about sexual and relationship satisfaction. We start by discussing how they are related to one another. We talk about sexual desire discrepancies, when they are a problem, and how to deal with them. We then discuss the sources of the formation of sexual values. Finally, we ask if the covid-19 pandemic had any impact on relationship satisfaction among couples.
