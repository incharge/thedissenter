In this episode, we focus on The Failures of Philosophy. We first discuss what Dr. Gaukroger means by failures in Philosophy in his book. We ask what philosophy is, and what we can learn about it by studying how it failed. We get into some of the history of philosophy, from Plato to the natural philosophers. Finally, we discuss the current status of philosophy, how it relates to science, and its possible future.
