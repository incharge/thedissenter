RECORDED ON DECEMBER 23rd 2021.  
Dr. Nicole Prause is a neuroscientist researching human sexual behavior, addiction, and the physiology of sexual response. She is also the founder of Liberos LLC, an independent research institute.

In this episode, we talk about sex, porn, and addiction. We start with sex, and hypersexual people. We then get into porn, and ask if it can be addictive, and talk about the relationship between porn consumption and sex drive, the effects of masturbation, the (negative) psychological effects of watching porn, and if it can affect relationship satisfaction and self/partner evaluations. We also discuss if the porn industry is bad for its performers; if the brain processes sex and porn differently; and who condemns porn, and who reports suffering from porn addiction.
