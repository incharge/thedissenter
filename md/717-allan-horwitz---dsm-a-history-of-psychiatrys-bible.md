In this episode, we focus on DSM. We start with a bit of the history of Psychiatry, and how the first psychiatric diagnoses appeared. We talk about the creation of the DSM, and its cultural impact. We cover three interpretations of the DSM: scientific progress; harmful impacts; and the social perspective. We talk about how mental disorders are researched, and their characteristics. We get into the DSM-5, and its promises. We discuss the merits and shortcomings of a biological approach to mental disorders. Finally, we talk about the future of the DSM, its positive impact, and what should be changed.
