Dr. Steven Hales is Professor and Chair of the Department of Philosophy at Bloomsburg University, US. His areas of specialization include epistemology and metaphysics. He’s the author of books like Metaphysics, A Companion to Relativism, Nietzsche’s Perspectivism, and This Is Philosophy.

In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of luck, and relativism. First, we discuss what is luck from a philosophical perspective, including the differences between epistemic and moral luck and the most prominent theories of luck. We also refer to some of the ways people tend to think about luck, according to the time frame and their worldviews. In the second part of the discussion, we talk abut relativism, is relationship with perspectivism and approaches to morality and moral relativism.
