RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 5th, 2019.  
Dr. Mark Sheskin is Assistant Professor of Social Sciences at Minerva Schools at KGI, and a Research Affiliate at Yale University, where he is coordinating thechidlab.com. His research interests are at the intersection of philosophy and psychology, with a particular focus on the origins of prosocial behavior and moral judgment. 

In this episode, we talk about the developmental psychology of morality and moral philosophy. We start off with children’s care for equality and fairness, including the development of numerical and quality equality. We also refer to what we can learn from studying close primates. We discuss if morality can be objective. And near the end we also talk about how people think about economic inequality, and if it is a problem by itself, or if fairness is more important.
