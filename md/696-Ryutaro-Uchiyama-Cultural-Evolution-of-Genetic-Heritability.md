RECORDED ON JULY 28th 2022.  
Dr. Ryutaro Uchiyama is a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. His research interests include cultural evolution, cognitive plasticity, and developmental psychobiology.

In this episode, we talk about the cultural evolution of genetic heritability. Dr. Uchiyama explains the cultural psychobiological framework. We talk about aspects of behavior genetics that get reframed in this framework, like heritability, the environment, gene-environment interactions, and gene-environment correlations. We discuss issues with the generalizability of genetic effects across societies and across time, and predicting how heritability should differ between societies, between socioeconomic levels, and other groupings within the same society. We get into the specific example of IQ and the Flynn effect. We also talk a bit about personality variation across societies, and limitations with the Big Five personality inventory.
