In this episode, we talk about Cultural Anthropology. Dr. Cronk starts first gives us a brief account of the history of the field, and then we discuss how to think about the relationship between biology and culture. We then get into more specific subjects of Dr. Cronk’s work, including the importance of separating behavior from culture, the mismatch between what people say and what they do, and why that happens. We also talk about human cooperation and the phenomenon of fitness interdependence, and a bit about the many layers and issues of cultural group selection.
