RECORDED ON JANUARY 26th 2022.  
Dr. Henkjan Honing is professor in Music Cognition at both the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Science of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). He conducts his research under the auspices of the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) and the University of Amsterdam's Brain and Cognition (ABC) Center. Dr. Honing is known as a passionate researcher in this new interdisciplinary field that gives us fundamental insights in the cognitive mechanisms underlying musicality. He published several books, including Music Cognition: The Basics (2021, Routledge), The Evolving Animal Orchestra: In Search of What Makes Us Musical (2019, The MIT Press)–, and an edited volume with a research agenda on musicality entitled The Origins of Musicality (2018, The MIT Press).

In this episode, we talk about musicality. We start with its cognitive components, and then go through: musicality in other animals; the relationship between musicality and language; the evolutionary functions of music; synchrony and social bonding; human universals in music; the neuroscience of music; sexual selection; and if other animals appreciate music.
