This is our fourth talk. This time, we go through topics like the relationship between science and fictional literature; how to create compelling characters; issues with character development in recent superhero movies and villains; “realism” in art, and what it means; the limits of free speech and humor; and being “genuine”, trolling, and over-sharing on the internet.
