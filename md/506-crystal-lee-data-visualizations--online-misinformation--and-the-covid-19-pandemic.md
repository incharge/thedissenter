RECORDED ON APRIL 30th 2021.  
Crystal Lee is a PhD candidate at the History / Anthropology / Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS) program at MIT, a researcher at the Visualization Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and a Fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. Her research focuses on how people interpret and make data visualizations. She also thinks a lot about the relationship between technology and disability, and she loves talking about mixed methods research that combines humanistic questions with data science and critical cartography. In her work as a Digital Teaching Fellow at Harvard, she created a curriculum to integrate digital mapping and visualization into the history of science. Previously, she was a visiting research scientist at the European Commission, and she graduated with high honors from Stanford University.

In this episode, we talk about online misinformation, and data visualizations. We start with data visualizations, and talk specifically about their impact on how information was conveyed during the covid-19 pandemic. We then discuss online misinformation. Finally, we talk about the work Crystal is doing on developing data visualizations for people with disabilities, like for example blind people.
