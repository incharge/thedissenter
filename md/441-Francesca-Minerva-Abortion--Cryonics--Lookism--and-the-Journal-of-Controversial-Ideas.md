RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 5th 2021.  
Dr. Francesca Minerva is a research fellow at Warwick University and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Ghent. She is the co-founder and co-editor of the Journal of Controversial Ideas. Her research focuses on applied philosophy, including lookism, conscientious objection, abortion, academic freedom, and cryonics.

In this episode, we talk about cryonics, lookism, abortion, academic freedom, and conscientious objection. We start with abortion, and refer to abortion before and after birth. We also discuss euthanasia, before moving on to cryonics, and life extension. We then talk about lookism, and discrimination against unattractive people, and what we can do about it. We talk briefly about conscientious objection applied to a medical context, focusing on abortion. Finally, we discuss academic Freedom, and the Journal of Controversial Ideas and its goals.
