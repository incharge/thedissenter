RECORDED ON MARCH 19th 2021.  
Dr. Henry Greely is currently the Deane F. and Kate Edelman Johnson Professor of Law and Professor by courtesy of Genetics at Stanford University, and also an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He specializes in the ethical, legal, and social implications of new biomedical technologies, particularly those related to neuroscience, genetics, or stem cell research. He is a founder and president of the International Neuroethics Society; a member of the Multi-Council Working Group of the NIH’s BRAIN Initiative, whose Neuroethics Working Group he co-chairs; a member of the Committee on Science, Technology, and Law of the National Academies; and chair of California’s Human Stem Cell Research Advisory Committee. He’s also the author of The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction, and more recently, CRISPR People: The Science and Ethics of Editing Humans.

In this episode, we focus on CRISPR People. Topics include: the CRISPR technology, and its applications; the He Jiankui experiment; gene editing in somatic versus germline cells; the ethics of gene editing; the legal aspects of gene editing and similar technologies; and how careful scientists should be when communicating about these technologies.
