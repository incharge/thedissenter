RECORDED ON OCTOBER 26th 2023.  
Dr. Daniel Simons is a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois, where he directs the Visual Cognition Laboratory. Dr. Simons studies visual cognition, perception, attention, and memory. Most of his recent research has focused on the cognitive underpinnings of our experience of a stable and continuous visual world. He is the author of The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us, and more recently, Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do about It.

In this episode, we focus on Nobody’s Fool. We talk about our “truth bias”, why it works most of the time, and what makes people skeptical in certain situations. We go through four psychological habits that make us susceptible to deception: focus, prediction, commitment, and efficiency. We discuss expectation-based reasoning, and how it can affect the production of scientific knowledge. We also go through four hooks that deceivers use: consistency, familiarity, precision, and potency. Finally, we talk about how deceivers try to target the most vulnerable people.
