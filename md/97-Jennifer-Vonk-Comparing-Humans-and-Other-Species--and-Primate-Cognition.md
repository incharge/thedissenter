Dr. Jennifer Vonk is Professor of comparative/cognitive psychology at Oakland University. Her primary research interests are in two overlapping areas: animal cognition, and cognitive development. The underlying goal of her work is to examine cognitive continuities and discontinuities between humans and both closely and distantly related species. 

In this episode, Dr. Vonk joins me to talk about what is comparative psychology; how we can apply evolutionary principles to better compare cognition between different species; the importance of studying how a trait develops during the lifetime of a species; the problem with anthropocentric approaches to studying other species; in what ways humans are different, and also how other animals might have some superior abilities; and, finally, the issue with studying animals in the wild and in the lab.
