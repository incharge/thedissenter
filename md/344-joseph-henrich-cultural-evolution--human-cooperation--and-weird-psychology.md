RECORDED ON JUNE 12th 2020.  
Dr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair of The Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested in the question of how humans evolved from "being a relatively unremarkable primate a few million years ago to the most successful species on the globe", and how culture affected our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret of Our Success and The WEIRDest People in World.

In this episode, we talk about some of the main topics in Dr. Henrich’s vast and interdisciplinary work. We first discuss the trouble with trying to integrate knowledge from different social sciences. Then, we talk about biases in cultural transmission, and genetic and cultural evolution. We also discuss the evolution of human cooperation, how societies scaled up, and the role of prosocial religions and Big Gods. We also talk about the Cultural Brain Hypothesis, collective intelligence, and a cultural evolutionary take on IQ. We characterize WEIRD psychology, comment a bit on Cecilia Heyes’ take on cultural evolutionary theory, and finally get Dr. Henrich’s take on group selection.
