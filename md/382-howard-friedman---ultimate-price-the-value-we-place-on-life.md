In this episode, we talk about Dr. Howard’s book, Ultimate Price. We discuss how the monetary value of a human life is calculated, and how it applies in several different instances, including the private and the public sector, the criminal justice system, the health system, life insurance, health insurance, the decision to have children, and war. We also talk about how we value humans lives in the covid-19 pandemic, and why we need regulation in capitalist societies.
