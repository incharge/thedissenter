RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 25th, 2019.  
Dr. Kevin Zollman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University. In addition to his primary appointment at Carnegie Mellon, he is an associate fellow at the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, a visiting professor at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (part of Ludwig-Maximilians Universität), and an associate editor of the journal Philosophy of Science. With Paul Raeburn, he is the author of The Game Theorist's Guide to Parenting.

In this episode, we talk about game theory applied to biological phenomena and social dynamics. We go through several topics, including evolutionary stable strategies; signaling theory; honest communication and language; behavioral plasticity, and the evolution of culture; social norms; and epistemic communities, and how to improve science production.
