RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 29th 2022.  
Dr. R. Paul Thompson holds appointments as Professor in the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. He has published extensively on evolutionary theory, population genetics, mathematical modelling in biology, theory structure in biology, philosophy of medicine, and ethics. He is the author of Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society.

In this episode, we focus on Evolution, Morality and the Fabric of Society. We first talk about a social contract theory of morality, evolutionary reproductive success, kin selection and reciprocal altruism, and the role of rational deliberation. We go through three derived principles of inclusion, individual sovereignty (liberty), and equality, and social issues like patriarchy, individual sovereignty and copulatory choices, and overpopulation and extinction. Finally, we ask if an evolutionary account of human morality commits us to moral anti-realism.
