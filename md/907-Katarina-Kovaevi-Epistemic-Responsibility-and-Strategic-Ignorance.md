RECORDED ON OCTOBER 19th 2023.  
Katarina Kovačević is a PhD candidate in the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University. Her main research interest is responsibility. She investigates how people ascribe responsibility for good and bad outcomes across various situations. She is specifically interested in epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance.

In this episode, we talk about epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance. We start by discussing how to approach responsibility from the perspective of psychology/cognitive science, and when exactly people ascribe responsibility to others. We talk about epistemic responsibility, what happens when people lack relevant information, if the effort put into acquiring it matters, and if outcomes matter. Finally, we discuss strategic ignorance, and focus on health-related examples, particularly testing for STIs.
