RECORDED ON MARCH 26th 2024.  
Dr. Amanda Podany is Professor Emeritus of History at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. She specializes in the study of Syria and Mesopotamia in the Middle and Late Bronze Age. She is the author of books like The Land of Hana: Kings, Chronology, and Scribal Tradition, The Ancient Near Eastern World, Brotherhood of Kings: How International Relations Shaped the Ancient Near East, The Ancient Near East: A Very Short Introduction, and the most recent one, Weavers, Scribes, and Kings: A New History of the Ancient Near East. She is also the instructor in a series of video and audio lectures for The Great Courses called Ancient Mesopotamia: Life in the Cradle of Civilization.

In this episode, we talk about the history of Mesopotamia. We first discuss what Mesopotamia was, whether it was the first civilization, the development of writing, linguistic and ethnic diversity in Mesopotamia, and trade relations and the role of merchants. We then talk about Hammurabi’s reign, the concept of “empire”, Hammurabi’s Code, whether violence was common in Mesopotamian society, and gender relations and the role of women. We also talk about the Kingdom of Hana, war and diplomacy in the Late Bronze Age, and the economy. Finally, we discuss the legacy of Mesopotamia, and whether the Mesopotamians were that different from us.
