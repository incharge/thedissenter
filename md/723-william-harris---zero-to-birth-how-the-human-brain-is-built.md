RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 30th 2022.  
Dr. William Harris is Professor Emeritus of Anatomy at Cambridge University and fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He was head of the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience since its formation in 2006 until his retirement in 2018. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2007, a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2007, and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2012. In 2017, he was awarded the Waddington Medal by the British Society for Developmental Biology for his work on the development of the visual system. He is the author of Zero to Birth: How the Human Brain Is Built.

In this episode, we focus on Zero to Birth. We talk about neural development, starting at its early stages, the genetic and environmental factors behind it, and how neural stem cells divide and proliferate. We get into post-natal brain growth, the regeneration of neurons, how different types of neurons develop, how the brain gets wired up and how neurons establish synapses. We also talk about critical periods in brain development, the limits of neuroplasticity, what is special about the human brain, and lateralization (with a focus on language and handedness). We end with a summary of the main messages of the book.
