In this episode, we talk about artificial intelligence. We start with what intelligence is, and what would human-level AI look like. We get into what is worrisome about advanced AI systems, and the issue with value alignment. We discuss different instances where AI is already impacting our lives, and where it will progress in the future, including the impact it will have on the job market. We also talk about possible solutions, and if we should be worried about how we treat AI systems.
