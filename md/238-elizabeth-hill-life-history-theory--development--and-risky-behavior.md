excerpt: Dr. Elizabeth Hill is Professor of Psychology at the University of Detroit
  Mercy. Dr. Hill received her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from Tulane University.
  She teaches courses in research methods, statistics, biopsychology, and gender differences.
  Her primary areas of research interest and activity focus on evolutionary and comparative
  psychology. She has investigated the interaction between biological and environmental
  factors in risk-taking behavior. In this research, she used evolutionary theory
  related to parental investment and life history strategies to conceptualize environmental
  factors, especially the impact of an unpredictable family environment. The areas
  of impulsivity, risky drinking and risk taking have been of most interest. She joined
  the University of Detroit Mercy faculty in 1997 and holds the position of Professor
  of Psychology. Hill also serves as the chair of the Detroit Mercy Institutional
  Review Board (IRB).

In this episode, we talk about life history theory, its application to humans, and understanding the development of risky behavior. First, Dr. Hill tells us what life history theory is about, and issues with individual differences in how people are susceptible to different environments. Then, we get into what are unpredictable environments, and the development of risky behavior.
