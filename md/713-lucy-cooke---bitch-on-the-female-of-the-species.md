RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 7th 2022.  
Lucy Cooke is a New York Times best-selling author, award-winning documentary filmmaker and broadcaster, National Geographic explorer and TED talker with a Masters in Zoology from the University of Oxford. Her latest book is Bitch: On the Female of the Species.

In this episode, we focus on Bitch. We start by discussing the difference between sex and gender, and where assumptions regarding the female sex come from. We talk about behavioral sex differences, how sex is defined, and hormones. We go through sexual selection, what females gain by mating with multiple partners, and the cost of sperm. We talk about how the study of the female genitalia has been neglected. We discuss if the female orgasm is an adaptation, and if there really is such a thing as a “maternal instinct”. We talk about mother-offspring conflict, and female intrasexual competition. We discuss primate societies, phylogenetic comparisons, and animal matriarchies. We talk about menopause and grandmothers. We discuss asexual reproduction, and if the Y chromosome is disappearing. Finally, we talk about the origins of gender inequality, and what needs to be revised in the field of evolutionary biology.
