RECORDED ON APRIL 29th 2024.  
Dr. Ann Pellegrini is Professor of Performance Studies & Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University, and a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. Their previous books include Performance Anxieties: Staging Psychoanalysis, Staging Race (Routledge, 1997) and the 2014 Lambda Finalist in Best LGBT Non-Fiction “You Can Tell Just by Looking” and 20 Other Myths About LGBT Life and People, coauthored with Michael Bronski and Michael Amico (Beacon Press, 2013).  
Dr. Avgi Saketopoulou is a psychoanalyst in private practice in NYC and a member of the faculty at the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.  
They are both authors of Gender Without Identity.

In this episode, we focus on Gender Without Identity. We start by talking about the history behind the book, and how psychoanalysis usually approaches LGBTQ+ people. We discuss the importance of history and social context, and we get into Drs. Pellegrini and Saketopoulou’s approach to gender identity. We discuss the issues with “born this way” arguments. We also talk about trauma from a psychoanalytic perspective, gender dysphoria, and how people deal with trauma.
