Dr. Alan Fiske is a Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He’s a psychological anthropologist studying how natural selection, neurobiology, ontogeny, psychology, and culture jointly shape human sociality. He’s also the author of the books Structures of Social Life: The Four Elementary Forms of Human Relations, and Virtuous Violence: Hurting and Killing to Create, Sustain, End, and Honor Social Relationships.  
In this episode, we talk about the four relational models at the basis of human sociality – Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing -, their universality, and also how they vary cross-culturally. We also talk about the relationship between sociality and morality, and the moral bases of violence. By the end, we also discuss moral relativism, and how science can inform morality.
