RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 19th 2022.  
Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science blog – Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature relevant to her subject – more often than not with an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the subject matter. She has held numerous lectures on the benefits of an evolutionary informed approach to understanding the cross-cultural sex and age differences in anti-social and criminal behavior. 

In this episode, we talk about violence from an evolutionary perspective. We get into the causes of criminal behavior, and discuss the relationship between mental illness and crime. We talk about the evolved functions of violence, violence as an intrasexual competition strategy, and the archaeological and ethnographic evidence behind it. In the last part of the interview, we discuss the relationship between legal access to abortion and levels of neonaticide, as well as the evolutionary rationale behind the opposition to abortion, as a way of controlling female sexual behavior.
