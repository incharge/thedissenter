Dr. Scott Grafton is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Dr. Grafton is interested in how people organize movement into goal-oriented action. The emphasis is on elucidating the cognitive architecture that underlies action representation. This is developed with studies of sequence and skill acquisition, motor simulation, sensorimotor transformation, on-line control and action observation experiments. He is the author of Physical Intelligence: The Science of How the Body and the Mind Guide Each Other Through Life.

In this episode, we focus on Physical Intelligence. We talk about physical intelligence and embodied cognition. We get into topics like: how we create a “mental space”; attention and vigilance; affordances; body schema and body self-image; and how people learn new skills. We discuss the relationship between the brain and the rest of the body, modularity of mind, and artificial intelligence.
