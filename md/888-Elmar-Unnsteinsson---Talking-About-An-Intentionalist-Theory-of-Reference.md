In this episode, we focus on Talking About. We discuss different theories of reference. We talk about Frege’s Curse, and identity confusion. We discuss the distinction between representational states and representational acts, and implicit beliefs. We talk about expressionist and intentionalist approaches to speaker meaning. Finally, we get into Dr. Unnsteinsson’s edenic intentionalism, and we talk about self-directed speech, and some challenges to his theory.
