RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 29th 2023.  
Dr. Rebecca Earle is a Professor in the Department of History at the University of Warwick. She is a historian, specializing in the history of food and colonial and 19th-century Spanish America. She is the author of books like “The Body of the Conquistador: Food, Race and the Colonial Experience in Spanish America, 1492-1700”, “Potato”, and “Feeding the People: The Politics of the Potato”.

In this episode, we talk about the history and politics of the potato. We start by talking about the origins of the potato, how good it is as a crop, and the status of potatoes in South America. We then discuss how the potato came to Europe and spread across the globe. We talk about the political significance of nutrition in the Enlightenment and the modern era. We discuss the Great Famine in Ireland and the response of the British government, and different political views about the potato. Finally, we discuss attempts by governments to regulate the food market, how people react to them, and whether we really choose what we eat.
