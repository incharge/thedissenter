In this episode, we focus on Threats. We start by talking about threats from an evolutionary perspective, and the kinds of behaviors and even human institutions that derive from how we evolved to process threats. We discuss deterrence behavior more specifically. In the second part of the interview, we talk about nuclear deterrence, the several issues and limitations with the theory behind it, and also demilitarization in Costa Rica.
