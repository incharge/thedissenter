RECORDED ON JANUARY 21st, 2020.  
Dr. Khandis Blake is an evolutionary social psychologist at The University of Melbourne. She is an expert in gendered conflict. Her research considers how behavior, attitudes, and culture associated with gender are influenced by the interplay between nature, nurture, and the state of the economy. Herself and her collaborators propose that gendered phenomena such as inimate partner violence, attitudes toward abortion, and male-male aggression arise partially out of market conditions that shift the bargaining power between men and women. Second, she investigates the causes and consequences of female competition and the conditions under which female sexualization elevates women's agency. Third, she develops methodological tools to advance the psychosocial study of female ovulation and ovarian hormones. Finally, she is interested in the social contexts eliciting aggression, especially male-to-female aggression and intimate partner violence.  

In this episode, we talk about several issues regarding female intrasexual competition in the modern world, gender inequality, and feminism from an evolutionary perspective. We first discuss how women compete, and focus on aggressive behavior. We then talk about intimate partner violence. We cover income inequality and effects on women’s intrasexual competition at several different levels, like the use of cosmetics and social media. We also explore sexual objectification, and hypersexualization in the West and the negative effects it might have on women. Finally, we talk about integrating Women’s Studies with Evolutionary Psychology to better understand and tackle current feminist issues.
