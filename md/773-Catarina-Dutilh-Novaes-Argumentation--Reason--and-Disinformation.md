Dr. Catarina Dutilh Novaes is Professor and University Research Chair at the Department of Philosophy of the VU Amsterdam. She is also a Professorial Fellow at Arché in St. Andrews (2019-2024). She is currently running the ERC Consolidator project 'The Social Epistemology of Argumentation' (2018-2023). Her main fields of research are history and philosophy of logic, philosophy of mathematics, and social epistemology. Dr. Novaes also has general interests in medieval philosophy, philosophy of psychology and cognitive science, general philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, issues pertaining to gender and race, and empirically-informed approaches to philosophy in general.

In this episode, we talk about argumentation, reason, and disinformation. We start with argumentation, and discuss what is it and what it is for; the contexts it applies to; what is a valid argument; adversariality; the role of trust; argumentation as a social phenomenon, and disagreements with Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber; the social epistemology of argumentation; and we also discuss if argumentation changes minds. We then talk about reason, and a disagreement with Mercier’s and Sperber’s modular nature of reason. Finally, we discuss disinformation, and if it is a new phenomenon.
