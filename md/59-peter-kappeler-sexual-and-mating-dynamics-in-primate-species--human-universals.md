Dr. Peter Kappeler is a Professor at the faculty of Zoology and Anthropology at Göttingen University, Germany, and at the Behavioral Ecology & Sociobiology department at the German Primate Center. He also teaches as a guest lecturer at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar. He’s the author or editor of books like Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals, Animal Behaviour: Evolution and Mechanisms, and The Evolution of Primate Species.  
In this episode, the conversation revolves around sexual selection in primate species, and human universals and the contributions of primatology to a better understanding of human behavior. Starting with the conditions to lead to the development of sexual dimorphisms, we then move on to talk about intersexual and intrasexual selection; the ecological conditions that favor male and female philopatry, that is, for males or females to stay in their troops of origin; pair-bonding in animals, and the problem with explaining monogamy; how sex ratios influence reproductive strategies; life history, and what it tells us about the evolutionary history of a particular species; primatology and the study of human universals; the relevance of the unique events in Homo sapiens’ evolutionary history; and also the studying of other animal taxa.
