RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 16th 2022.  
Dr. Aaron Sell is Assistant Professor of Psychology and Criminology at Heidelberg University. He is an evolutionary psychologist interested in anger and aggression, hatred, and formidability estimation.

In this episode, we talk about the evolution of the emotions of anger and hatred. We star by discussing emotions from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about anger, its functions, what triggers it, and cues of strength. We then get into hatred, how it differs from anger, and their relationship with revenge and conflict. We talk about how males assess fighting ability. We discuss if emotions are adaptations. Finally, we talk about justice-making institutions, and ask if criminal justice is based on punishment or repair.
