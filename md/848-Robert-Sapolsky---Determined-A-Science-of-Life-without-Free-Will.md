This is our third interview. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/S9pqdKP9tuk. And the second one here: https://youtu.be/9q8h4C57mTw

In this episode, we focus on Determined. We start by discussing the relationship between the science of human behavior and questions regarding free will, and why people believe in free will. We discuss whether it matters if we cannot fully predict behavior yet. We talk about intent and premeditation, biology and the environment, luck, and self-control. We discuss if people can choose the sort of people they will become. We talk about the idea of meritocracy, and the roles of blame, praise, and punishment. We discuss if hard determinists are bad people, and whether we should refrain from making absolute claims regarding free will. Finally, Dr. Sapolsky tells us what it would take for someone to convince him that free will exists.
