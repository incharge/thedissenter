In addition to being one of the country’s leading public intellectuals, Professor Fish is an extraordinarily prolific author whose works include He has authored over 200 scholarly publications and books. While his research covers a variety of fields, Professor Dr. Fish has written for many of the country’s leading law journals. including Stanford Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Yale Law Journal, University of Chicago Law Review, Columbia Law Review, and Texas Law Review.

In this episode, we focus on free speech. Dr. Fish presents his thesis against the idea that free speech exists, and we discuss its details. We start with a bit of Dr. Fish’s background and where his interest in free speech comes from, and also a definition of free speech. We talk about John Stuart Mill’s position, and the history of the political struggle for free speech. We discuss freedom of speech in the context of academia and the media. We ask if it makes sense to distinguish speech from action, and also address the distinction between freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry. Toward the end, Dr. Fish explains why he thinks “philosophy does not matter”.
