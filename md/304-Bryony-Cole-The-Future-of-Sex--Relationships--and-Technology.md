Bryony Cole is the host of sex tech podcast Future of Sex and works as a researcher and strategist in future human and technology fields. She is the world’s leading authority on sextech. Since launching the top-rated podcast, Future of Sex, Bryony has been on stages across the world, defining the direction of sextech for governments, technology and entertainment companies. Her wide body of research and annual Future of Sex report are considered the lead in industry insights. Bryony is an international speaker, published writer and producer, who has been featured on shows like Viceland and Technopia, and articles in Wired, TechCrunch, The New York Times, Playboy, Mashable, Motherboard, ABC, Financial Review, Brides, Glamour and many other global media.

In this episode, we address what the future might be reserving for us in terms of sexual experiences, human relationships and emergent sex technology. We go through the topic of how and why sex is still a social taboo. We clarify the fact that, even though we focus a lot on the technology, the future will also include the human relationships themselves. We refer to some non-normative sex preferences, and how society deals with “deviant” sex behavior. We then discuss modern sex education, particularly in the West, and the new challenges, particularly coming from learning how to deal with the virtual world, and things like social media. We talk about the complex intricacies of pornography and prostitution for both the consumer and the performer, connecting it with sex-positive feminism. We address technology like sex robots and teledildonics, and the new kinds of relationships and experiences that they already allow for. Finally, we briefly talk about new relationship styles, like polyamory, and the challenges involved there.
