RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 8th 2023.  
Dr. Paul van Geert is Professor Emeritus of Developmental Psychology at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. He is renowned for his work on developmental psychology and the application of dynamical systems theory in social science. He is the author of A Dynamic Systems Model of Cognitive and Language Growth, Dynamic Systems of Development: Change between Complexity and Chaos, and, together with Naomi de Ruiter, Toward a Process Approach in Psychology: Stepping into Heraclitus' River.

In this episode, we talk about a dynamical systems theory approach to developmental psychology. We discuss what is the evidence for psychology being a dynamic system. We talk about levels of analysis, causality in psychology, and stages of development and critical periods. We discuss a process ontology, and how it differs from a substance ontology. We talk about 4E cognition. Finally, we discuss language development, and challenging Chomskyan views of it; and theory-of-mind development, and the idea of innateness.
