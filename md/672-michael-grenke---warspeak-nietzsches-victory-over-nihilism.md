In this episode, we focus on Warspeak. We talk about nihilism, and its different kinds. We focus on Genealogy of Morals, and discuss why it was a “polemic”, slave morality, master morality, the history of European morality, the moral-theological prejudice, the ascetic ideal, how culture influences human psychology, the origins of nihilism, nihilism in modern society, solutions for nihilism, and what “warspeak” means.
