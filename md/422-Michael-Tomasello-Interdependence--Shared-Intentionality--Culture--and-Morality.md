Dr. Michael Tomasello is an American developmental and comparative psychologist, as well as linguist.

Earning many prizes and awards from the end of the 1990s onward, he is considered one of today's most authoritative developmental and comparative psychologists. He is "one of the few scientists worldwide who is acknowledged as an expert in multiple disciplines". His "pioneering research on the origins of social cognition has led to revolutionary insights in both developmental psychology and primate cognition."

In this episode, we talk about developmental and comparative psychology, with a focus on Dr. Tomasello’s latest book, Becoming Human. Topics include: comparative psychology, and how to compare ourselves to other primates; three types of morality (derived from kin selection; derived from interdependence; derived from culture); shared and collective intentionality; the development of institutions; the relationship between sociality and morality; natural and cultural morality; group selection; if human morality is innate; the importance of language; and studying isolated children.
