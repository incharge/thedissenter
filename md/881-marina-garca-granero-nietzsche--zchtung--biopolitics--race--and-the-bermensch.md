Dr. Marina García-Granero is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Valencia (Spain). She is a former postdoc from the Institute of Philosophy at KU Leuven (Belgium), where she worked in 2022 as an Associate Member of an ERC Project titled "Homo Mimeticus." She earned her Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Valencia with a thesis on Nietzsche's concept of "breeding" or "cultivation" (Züchtung) in 2021. Her research and teaching areas are Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, ethics, and feminist philosophy.

In this episode, we talk about Nietzsche’s philosophy. We start by discussing why Nietzsche’s body of work is open to so many different interpretations, and whether there is intellectual continuity across his works. We talk about the concept of Züchtung, and how it applies to biopolitics. We discuss what Nietzsche means by “race”, how European/white supremacists misinterpret Nietzsche, the process of incorporation (Einverleibung), and Nietzsche’s call to overcome race (Über-Rasse). We talk about how in Nietzsche’s philosophy the point of view of value is more fundamental than the point of view of truth. We discuss the genealogical method. Finally, we discuss whether Nietzsche’s notion of the Übermensch relates to contemporary transhumanist ideas.
