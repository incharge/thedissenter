RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 2nd 2023.  
Dr. Dale Greenwalt is Research Associate in the laboratory of Dr. Conrad Labandeira, curator of fossil arthropods, in the Paleobiology Department at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. His work centers on description of the insect fauna of the Coal Creek Member of the Middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation in northwestern Montana. He is also interested in defining the biological and geological processes that resulted in the preservation of these insects and the original biomolecular components that are found in the fossils of the Kishenehn Formation. He is the author of Remnants of Ancient Life: The New Science of Old Fossils.

In this episode, we focus on Remnants of Ancient Life. We start by discussing what fossils are, and what we expect to learn from them. We talk about how biomolecules are preserved, the origin of life on Earth, a fossil of a blood-engorged mosquito, ancient pigments, biometals, proteins, ancient DNA, and the evolution of plants. Finally, we discuss how much we could potentially learn about the phylogenies and ancient physiologies of the total biomass of the Earth through ancient biomolecules, and the future of the field.
