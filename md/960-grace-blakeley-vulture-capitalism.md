In this episode, we focus on Vulture Capitalism. We start by talking about the most common misconceptions people have about how capitalism works. We then discuss how businesses are planned, the importance of labor movements, how companies get state support, and how countries from the global North exploit countries from the global South. We discuss what “freedom” means, and how people can democratize institutions and take back control. Finally, we talk about the current state of the world, and reasons for being optimistic.
