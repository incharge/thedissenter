RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 1st 2021.  
Dr. Philippe Rochat is Professor of Psychology at Emory University. What is the nature and origins of human self-conscious psychology? Driven by this question, the main focus of Dr. Rochat's research in the Emory Infant and Child Lab is on the early sense of self, emerging self-concept, the development of social cognition and relatedness, and the emergence of a moral sense during the preschool years in children from all over the world growing up in different cultural environments and socio-economic circumstances. Dr. Rochat has published five books, including Moral Acrobatics: How We Avoid Ethical Ambiguity by Thinking in Black and White.

In this episode, we focus on Moral Acrobatics. The topics covered include: black-and-white thinking; three forces: in-group favoritism (parochialism), the basic need to affiliate; the struggle for recognition (reputation); essentialism; the fundamental attribution error; ethical ambiguity and how we avoid it; the developmental psychology of lying; legal systems; individual differences in moral acrobatics; and if it is possible for us to become better people by learning about moral development.
