In this episode, we focus on Quit. We start by talking about grit and quit, and how they can complement each other. We discuss if “never quit” is ever a good message, and the social stigma associated with quitting. We talk about planning for quitting, dealing with the “what-ifs”, and setting “killer criteria”. We go through the psychological effects that make it harder to quit, including loss aversion, the sunk cost fallacy, the endowment effect, personal identity, and setting goals. We discuss how other people can help us quit. Finally, we talk about how this all applies in the context of poker playing.
