Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology. Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining these models with a variety of research methods. He’s the author of Evolutionary Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.

In this episode, we focus on psychological gender differences. We talk about play in males and females; differences in education and occupational choices, according to personality tendencies; assessing sex differences and similarities; gender stereotypes, and if they are right; the distinction between “sex” and “gender”, and if it is a useful one; evolutionary and socialization theories of sex differences; things that people from the socialization side get wrong about evolutionary psychology; animal models, and comparative psychology; and, finally, why it is important, not only for scientists but also to the general public, to study and learn about sex differences.  
This is the second part of a 2-part talk on gender differences. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/4NVj6mCDJ5M
