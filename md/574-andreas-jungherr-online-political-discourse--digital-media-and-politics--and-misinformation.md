In this episode, we talk about political discourse and political behavior, online and offline, and about online misinformation. We talk about how complicated it is to draw inferences about people’s political preferences and behavior from digital data, and how digital media have changed how political campaigns are done. We focus a lot on Twitter as a platform for research on politics. We also discuss the impact of online misinformation. We wrap things up with a positive evidence-based message for people who want to navigate the digital world without becoming cynical.
