RECORDED ON JULY 18th, 2020.  
Dr. Agner Fog is associate professor of computer science at Technical University of Denmark. Dr. Fog does research in Evolutionary Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, Social systems and Computer Science. His current project is 'Theory of cultural change based on evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and cultural evolution.' He’s the author of “Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture”.

In this episode, we talk about warlike and peaceful societies. We discuss if war is part of human nature, and the ecological conditions that favor war and peace. We also mention the social structure of warlike societies. We ask why most warriors and chiefs are men. We then get into regality theory, and the differences between what Dr. Fog calls regal and kungic societies. We talk about the different types of war, focusing mostly on civil wars, and we also about terrorism and counterterrorist measures. We also refer to the Long Peace, authoritarianism on the right and the left, and scaremongering (in mass media). Finally, we talk about why Scandinavian peoples are the happiest in the world, and if regality theory can help us prevent and end wars, and change political systems.
