Dr. Agustín Fuentes is Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University. His research focuses on the biosocial, delving into the entanglement of biological systems with the social and cultural lives of humans, our ancestors, and a few of the other animals with whom humanity shares close relations. Dr. Fuentes was awarded the Inaugural Communication & Outreach Award from the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, the President’s Award from the American Anthropological Association, and elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of books like Race, Monogamy, and Other Lies They Told You: Busting Myths about Human Nature, and Why We Believe: Evolution and the Human Way of Being.

This interview is part of the series on the 150th anniversary of Darwin’s Descent of Man.

In this episode, we talk about biological anthropology, and Darwin’s Descent of Man. We get a bit into the field of Biological Anthropology, and talk about the kinds of questions it deals with. We talk about belief. We then get into some myths about human evolution, including race and sex differences, in the context of Darwin’s Descent of Man. We discuss monogamy and human mating systems. We talk about some issues with taking modern hunter-gatherers as representative of ancestral societies, and with some ideas in evolutionary psychology, like the concept of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Other topics include aggression as an illustrative example of how people theorize about sex differences; human nature; and the overall importance of Darwin’s theories.
