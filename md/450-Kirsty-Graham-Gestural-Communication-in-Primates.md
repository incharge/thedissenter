excerpt: Dr. Kirsty Graham is Research Associate at the University of St. Andrews.
  Her PhD research, supervised by Prof. Richard Byrne, catalogued the full gestural
  repertoire of wild bonobos. She examined individual differences in repertoire size
  and usage. Most importantly, she defined the meaning of each gesture type by determining
  the reaction given by the recipient that satisfies the signaller. Understanding
  meanings or ambiguity of meanings for wild bonobo gestural communication provides
  insights into the evolution of our own complex communication system.

RECORDED ON JANUARY 20th 2021.  
Dr. Kirsty Graham is Research Associate at the University of St. Andrews. Her PhD research, supervised by Prof. Richard Byrne, catalogued the full gestural repertoire of wild bonobos. She examined individual differences in repertoire size and usage. Most importantly, she defined the meaning of each gesture type by determining the reaction given by the recipient that satisfies the signaller. Understanding meanings or ambiguity of meanings for wild bonobo gestural communication provides insights into the evolution of our own complex communication system.

In this episode, we talk about gestural communication in primates. We discuss what communication is from an evolutionary perspective. We then get into gestural communication, focusing on bonobos, chimpanzees, and humans.
