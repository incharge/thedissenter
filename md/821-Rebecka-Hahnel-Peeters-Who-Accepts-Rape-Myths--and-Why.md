RECORDED ON MARCH 21st 2023.  
Rebecka Hahnel-Peeters is a PhD student studying human behavior from an adaptationist perspective in the Evolutionary Psychology Lab at the University of Texas at Austin with Dr. David Buss. She joined the Buss Lab after finishing her MA Degree at California State University, Fullerton in Spring 2021. In her Master's thesis, she sought to understand individual differences in rape myth acceptance. She is currently interested in sexual conflict and women's psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation.

In this episode, we talk about rape myth acceptance, strategies against sexual exploitation, and the relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology. We start by discussing rape myth acceptance; some common rape myths; the Rape Excusing Attitudes and Language Scale; the reproductive self-interest model of morality (RSIMM) as a framework for understanding moral judgments associated with sexual behavior; individual differences in attitudes toward abortion, prostitution, and contraception; and what predicts rape myth acceptance. We then talk about female psychological adaptations against sexual exploitation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary anthropology.
