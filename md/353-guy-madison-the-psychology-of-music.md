RECORDED ON JUNE 17th, 2020.  
Dr. Guy Madison is Professor at the Department of Psychology at University of Umeå, Sweden. Dr. Madison does research in Neuroscience, Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. 

In this episode, we talk about the psychology of music, and several of the topics studied in this discipline. We talk about the possible evolutionary bases of music, including the role of sexual selection. We also discuss the genetic basis of musical ability, how it relates to personality and IQ, how music might improve certain kinds of physical exercise, isochrony and human rhythm, and how people develop their musical preferences.
