RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 28th 2023.  
Dr. Merlijn Olthof is a Post-Doc in Tipping points in Treatment at the University of Groningen, and Lecturer in Pedagogical Sciences at Radboud University. His work focuses on complex systems, clinical psychology, developmental psychopathology, and related topics.

In this episode, we talk about a complex systems approach to psychopathology. We first talk about the study of behavioral variability within individuals, and some conceptual foundations of a complex systems approach to psychopathology, like critical fluctuations, destabilization, and order transitions. We discuss the study of early warning signals, and some of its limitations. We talk about large shifts in symptom severity. We discuss the differences between group-based “disease models” and personalized approaches inspired by complex systems theory. We talk about psychopathology as emergent and self-organized. Finally, we discuss implications for the classification of mental disorders and public health.
