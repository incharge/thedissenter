RECORDED ON JULY 11th 2022.  
Dr. Christopher Krupenye is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Krupenye is interested in the cognitive abilities of humans and other species, especially those involved in navigating the social world.

In this episode, we talk about aspects of primate sociality. We start with theory of mind, and discuss if it is a unitary capacity, and how to study it in nonhuman primates. We ask if other primates have theory of mind, and talk about studying self and self-awareness. We also get into understanding false beliefs, sharing behavior, prosociality, and a preference for helpers or hinderers.
