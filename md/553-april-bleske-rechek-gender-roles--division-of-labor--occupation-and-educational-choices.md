RECORDED ON AUGUST 12th 2021.  
Dr. April Bleske-Rechek is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. As a researcher, she focuses on human mating, friendship, cognitive abilities and intellectual giftedness, and science literacy.

In this episode, we talk about a recent paper, “Gendered Perspectives on Sharing the Load: Men’s and Women’s Attitudes Toward Family Roles and Household and Childcare Tasks”. We first talk about where the evolutionary bases of the human sexual division of labor. We go through some of the household and childcare tasks men and women prefer. We talk about how the ways men and women share the load changed since the 60s, and in what ways resource allocation might differ between modern industrialized societies and traditional societies. We also spend a lot of time discussing how evolved sex differences translate into occupational and educational preferences, and why this is not a sign of sexism. Toward the end we stress what evolutionary approaches to human behavior are really about – describing behavior – and not about following any political, moral, or ideological agenda, and why people should keep that in mind if they want to understand social phenomena. We also discuss the trade-off women make between family and career.
