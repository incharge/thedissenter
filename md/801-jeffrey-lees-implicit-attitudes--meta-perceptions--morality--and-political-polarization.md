RECORDED ON MARCH 7th 2023.  
Dr. Jeffrey Lees is Associate Research Scholar in the Behavioral Science for Policy Lab at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. in Organizational Behavior & Psychology from Harvard University in 2020. He is a behavioral scientist studying the consequences of inaccurate beliefs for organizations, politics, and society.

In this episode, we talk about implicit attitudes and meta-perceptions, and how they apply to politics and morality. We start by discussing what implicit attitudes are, and how they are studied and measured. We talk about social judgments of other people’s preferences, and their accuracy. We discuss group meta-perceptions, how they drive negative out-group attributions, and their relationship with political violence. We then get into social influences on moral cognition, and also talk about meta-perceptions of morally questionable actors. Finally, we discuss misperceived polarization and where it stems from, and strategies to address political polarization.
