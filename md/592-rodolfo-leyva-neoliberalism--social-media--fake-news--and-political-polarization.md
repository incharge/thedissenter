Dr. Rodolfo Leyva is a Fellow in the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Lecturer in the University of Birmingham.

Prior to his current appointment, he has been a lecturer at several universities and have led various quantitative and qualitative research methods, sociology, and media modules.

In this episode, we talk about neoliberalism, social media, fake news, and political polarization. We discuss the disputed definition of neoliberalism, and get into the ways the media promote it. We talk about the psychological effects of shows which promote materialistic values. We then get into social media, how social dynamics change there, political polarization, political activism, fake news and its real effects, and the negative effects of social media. Finally, we discuss if people’s personal background influence how politically active they are.
