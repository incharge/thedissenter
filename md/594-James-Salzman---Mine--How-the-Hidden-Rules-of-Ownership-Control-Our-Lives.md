RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 18th 2021.  
Dr. James Salzman is the Donald Bren Distinguished Professor of Environmental Law with joint appointments at the UCLA School of Law and at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. In twelve books and more than 100 articles and book chapters, his broad-ranging scholarship has addressed topics spanning drinking water, trade and environment conflicts, ownership engineering, and creating markets for ecosystem services. He is the author of Mine!: How the Hidden Rules of Ownership Control Our Lives.

In this episode, we focus on Mine! We talk about where our sense of ownership comes from, and the six different stories of ownership people have. We discuss if these stories are universal across societies and cultures, and how people decide which one is the best. We talk about how ownership works differently for intangible things, and how companies take advantage of people’s sense of ownership. We discuss the ownership principle of attachment, and how it can be used to help solving climate change. Finally, we discuss if rules of ownership need to be codified in the law.
