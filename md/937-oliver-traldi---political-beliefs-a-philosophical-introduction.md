RECORDED ON APRIL 17th 2024.  
Dr. Oliver Traldi is a John and Daria Barry Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James Madison Program at Princeton University. He studies epistemology, focusing on questions about the nature of epistemic norms and the epistemology of the social world, especially the epistemology of politics. He works on norms of inquiry, conceptual engineering, reasons for belief, inferring beliefs from actions, the epistemology of disagreement, and the epistemology of moral progress. He is the author of Political Beliefs: A Philosophical Introduction.

In this episode, we focus on Political Beliefs. We start by discussing what political epistemology is, what counts as political, what political beliefs are, and what political disagreements are based on. We then go through theories of political beliefs, including the ones based on personality and moral foundations theory, ideology, group membership, social isolation, and cognitive heuristics. We talk about the epistemology of democracy and expertise. We address the issue of conspiracy theories. Finally, we discuss whether the history of our society has any bearing on our political beliefs.
