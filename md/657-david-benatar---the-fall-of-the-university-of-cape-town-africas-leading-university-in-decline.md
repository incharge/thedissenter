RECORDED ON MAY 5th 2022.  
Dr. David Benatar is professor of philosophy at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa. He is best known for his advocacy of anti-natalism in his book Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence, in which he argues that coming into existence is a serious harm, regardless of the feelings of the existing being once brought into existence, and that, as a consequence, it is always morally wrong to create more sentient beings. His new book is The Fall of the University of Cape Town: Africa’s Leading University in Decline.

In this episode, we focus on The Fall of the University of Cape Town. Dr. Benatar gives us a brief overview of how the decline at UCT started, how it was dealt with, and the demands made by the students. We talk about terms like “transformation” and “decolonization” of the curricula. We discuss the role of university, and academic freedom. We talk about racial issues in South Africa, affirmative action, cancel culture, and identity politics. Finally, we ask if there are any good solutions to what is happening at UCT.
