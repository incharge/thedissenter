In this episode, we talk about the psychology of music. We first go through how music is a construct of our brains and its evolutionary bases. Then we discuss if music is a human universal, and if anyone can learn music. We talk a bit about the neuroscience of music, and catchy tunes and earworms. Finally, we cover some aspects of music appreciation and the acquisition of musical tastes.
