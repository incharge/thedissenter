THIS IS AN AUDIO-ONLY INTERVIEW.  
Dr. Elizabeth Loftus is a Distinguished Professor of Psychological Science and Law, and of Cognitive Science in the Departments of Psychological Science, and Criminology, Law, and Society at University of California, Irvine. She is also Fellow of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. Dr. Loftus is best known for her ground-breaking work on the misinformation effect and eyewitness memory, and the creation and nature of false memories, including recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. As well as her work inside the laboratory, she has been involved in applying her research to legal settings.

In this episode, we first talk about how memories can be interfered with, and refer to the misinformation effect. We also discuss if people rewrite their memories when they recall them. Then we get into the many issues with eyewitness testimonies, and how to improve on them. Finally, we also go through the repressed and recovered memory therapy, its several flaws, and how it affects patients and other potential victims.
