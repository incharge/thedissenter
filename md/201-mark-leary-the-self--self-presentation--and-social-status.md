In this episode, we discuss things related to our notion of “self”, how we construct it, and how we move in our social environments, deal with other people, and react to social exclusion. We deal with sociometer theory, and mental mechanisms like self-presentation, self-compassion, self-reflection, and their relationship with academic success and other life outcomes.
