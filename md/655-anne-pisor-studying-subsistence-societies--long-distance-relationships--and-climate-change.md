RECORDED ON MAY 3rd 2022.  
Dr. Anne Pisor is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Washington State University. Her research interests include long-distance relationships and resource management, long-distance relationships and the downsides of climate change, and the evolution of human sociality.

In this episode, we talk about topics in evolutionary anthropology, including: long-distance relationships, and how they’re built; inter-group tolerance; studying human sociality in preliterate societies, and the assumptions we have about them; parochial altruism; how people valuate out-group strangers; Dr. Pisor’s fieldwork in the Bolivian Amazon and Tanzania; and climate change, how it affects human societies, how they adapt to it, and what industrialized societies can learn from them.
