In this episode, we focus on The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. We first get into some historical background, and talk about how old the concept of AI is. We discuss how we should be realistic in our worries about future AI developments. We talk about principles of ethical AI, and a distinction between soft and hard ethics. We go through challenges posed by algorithms, and how AI can be used for criminal activity. Finally, we talk about the idea of AI for Social Good.
