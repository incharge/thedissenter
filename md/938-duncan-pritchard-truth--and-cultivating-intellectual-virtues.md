RECORDED ON DECEMBER 13th 2023.  
Dr. Duncan Pritchard is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy in the Philosophy School of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Oxford University Press's Oxford Bibliographies: Philosophy and the co-Editor-in-Chief (and co-Founder) of the International Journal for the Study of Skepticism. Dr. Pritchard mostly works in epistemology, and has written on most of the topics in this field, including radical skepticism, theory of knowledge, virtue epistemology, modal epistemology, epistemic luck/risk, social epistemology, understanding, inquiry, know-how, and so on.

In this episode, we start by discussing what truth is, and how we can get to it. We talk about what valuing truth means, the intellectual virtues, epistemic luck and epistemic risk, and valuable kinds of ignorance. Finally, we discuss what education should be about, how to cultivate intellectual virtues in students, and the role of technology in education.
