RECORDED ON APRIL 13th 2021.  
Dr. Nicolas Bommarito is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Simon Fraser University. His research focuses on questions in virtue ethics, moral psychology, and Buddhist philosophy, particularly Tibetan Buddhism. He is the author of Seeing Clearly: A Buddhist Guide to Life.

In this episode, we focus on Seeing Clearly. We start with some of the theoretical foundations of Buddhism, and cover concepts like emptiness, the relational nature of reality, the self, and attachment. We talk about personal transformation and the more existential aspects of Buddhism, including the concept of potential, death, goals in life, morality, karma, and nirvana. We also talk about Buddhism in the West, and things like mindfulness. Finally, we discuss the practice of Buddhism, and ask where people who are interested in becoming Buddhists should start from.
