RECORDED ON AUGUST 5th 2021.  
Dr. Edward Watts is presently the Vassiliadis Professor of Byzantine Greek History at UC San Diego, where he was formerly Co-Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies. His research interests center on the intellectual and religious history of the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. He is the author of several books on ancient history, including Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell Into Tyranny. His new book is The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome: The History of a Dangerous Idea.

In this episode, we focus on The Eternal Decline and Fall of Rome. We walk through topics like: when did people start theorizing about the decline and fall of Rome; the actual factors that played a role in the fall of Rome; periods in Roman history where there was renewal without decline, and decline and false renewal; dynamics of conservatism, decline, renewal, and progress in the history of Rome; the role of Christianity in the later stages of the Western Roman Empire, and in the Byzantine Empire; Europe in the aftermath of the fall of Rome; the Holy Roman Empire; the “decline of the West”, if it is real, and how populists on the right and the left take advantage of narratives of “decline”. Finally, we discuss how we can prevent populist political movements from rising, and the ethical duty of historians.
