Most of her research career has been devoted to cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, kin groups, gender roles, predictors of war and other forms of violence, but for the last eight years she has been working on cultural adaptations to natural hazards and other resource stressors. She is interested in research that integrates the fields of anthropology as well as anthropology with other disciplines.

In this episode, we talk about topics in cultural anthropology. We start by talking about tight and loose cultures, and the ecological factors behind them, including natural hazards. We talk about altered states of consciousness, and male initiation ceremonies. We discuss how human sexuality varies cross-culturally, and the bases of gender differences and sexual division of labor. Finally, we talk about comparative cultural databases, the challenges of using them, and the example of studying children’s play and work.
