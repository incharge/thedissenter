This is my second interview with Victoria. You can find our first talk here: https://youtu.be/T6gTK0dZcQc  
In this episode, we talk about Victoria’s creative process; the difficulties in worldbuilding; how child stories can be much more complex and mature than they seem; the fictions people create online and on social media; if religious people are better writers than atheists; tribalism, politics, and how it affects fiction and the society in general; the social importance of comedy; how readers and critics interpret fiction; writing from first-person and third-person perspectives; and some interesting villains in series, movies, and books.
