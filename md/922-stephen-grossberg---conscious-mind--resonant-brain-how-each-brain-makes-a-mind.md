RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 21st 2024.  
Dr. Stephen Grossberg is Wang Professor of Cognitive and Neural Systems, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics & Statistics, Psychological & Brain Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering, Founding Chairman of the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, and Founder and Director of the Center for Adaptive Systems at Boston University.  He is the author of several books, the latest one being Conscious Mind, Resonant Brain: How Each Brain Makes a Mind.

In this episode, we focus on Conscious Mind, Resonant Brain. We start by talking about how physics and psychology split in the approach to the brain; the mind-body problem; and whether our brains are like computers. We talk about perception and awareness, visual illusions and art, how we go from seeing to recognizing and to predicting, the relationship between emotion and cognition, and how we get unified moments of conscious awareness. We discuss the role of the prefrontal cortex, learning, the evolution of the brain, theories of consciousness, and the hard problem of consciousness. We talk about mental disorders, irrational decisions, and the design of AI systems. Finally, we discuss morality and the human condition, the unification of psychology and physics, and potential laws of biology.
