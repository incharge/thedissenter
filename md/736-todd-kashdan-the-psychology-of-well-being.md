In this episode, we talk about the psychology of well-being. We first define it as a psychological construct, and discuss how it is measured. We discuss aspects of psychology that correlate with well-being, like being future-oriented, having goals, and being a good person. We talk about individual differences in personality traits, how people react to life events, and changes in well-being across the lifespan. We discuss psychological strengths and psychological flexibility. Finally, we talk about the link between well-being and interpersonal relationships.
