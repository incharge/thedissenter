Dr. Maryanne Fisher is a Professor in the Department of Psychology, and a member of the Women and Gender Studies Program, at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Canada. Her research on how women compete for men has received international media attention, such as the BBC and Discovery Channel. She also investigates the determinants of women's physical attractiveness and what women want in a mate. She has published over 90 peer-reviewed journal articles primarily related to interpersonal relationships. She is an award-winning teacher, and was recognized by the Canadian Progress Club as a Woman of Excellent in the Division of Research and Education. She’s also the editor of Evolution's Empress: Darwinian Perspectives on the Nature of Women.

In this episode, we talk about evolutionary psychology and feminism. We first refer to determinants of female attractiveness and mate preferences; and intrasexual competition strategies, and how some of them may backfire. In the second part, we discuss how we can integrate evolutionary theory and feminism, and also aspects of women’s evolution and behavior that have traditionally been neglected in evolutionary psychology, particularly women’s friendships. We also talk about evolutionary approaches to art, and what women like to paint. Toward the end, we discuss the extent to which the State should regulate certain activities, like prostitution.
