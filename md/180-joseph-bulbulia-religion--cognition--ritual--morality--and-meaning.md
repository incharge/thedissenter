In this episode, we talk about the cognitive science of religion. First, we discuss how religion is a multifaceted phenomenon, its evolutionary bases, and the complicated causal relationship between beliefs and actions. Then, we talk about religions rituals, what they are about, and the effects they have on people, particularly the high-arousal ones. We also refer to costly signaling in the context of religion, and its relationship to trust, and how socioeconomic factors and natural disasters influence adherence to religion. Finally, we talk about some philosophical aspects of religion, like the one related to meaning, and how by studying religion we can get insights into other social domains of human life.
