THIS INTERVIEW IS AUDIO-ONLY.  
Dr. Joanna Schug is Associate Professor of Psychology and Undergraduate Studies Director at the College of William & Mary. Her areas of specialization include cross-cultural psychology, social psychology, and socio-ecological approaches to human behavior.

In this episode, we talk about the socio-ecological approach, emotional expressivity, and relational mobility. We first refer to what the socio-ecological approach is and where it is positioned within Psychology. We then address the topic of emotional expressivity, and cultural differences between the West and Eastern Asia, regarding collectivism vs. individualism, and types of cognition – holistic and analytic thinking. Finally, we talk about relational mobility, the factors behind it, and how it can lead to increasingly segregated and polarized societies.
