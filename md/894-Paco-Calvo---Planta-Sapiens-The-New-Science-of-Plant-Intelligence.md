RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 26th 2023.  
Dr. Paco Calvo is a Professor at the University of Murcia in Spain, where he leads the Minimal Intelligence Lab (MINT Lab), focusing on the study of minimal cognition in plants. Dr. Calvo’s interdisciplinary work combines insights from biology, philosophy, and cognitive science to explore the fascinating world of plant behavior, decision-making, and problem-solving. By investigating the complex interactions and adaptive responses exhibited by plants, Dr. Calvo has significantly contributed to our understanding of cognition beyond the animal kingdom, challenging conventional perspectives on intelligence and mental capacities. He is the author of Planta Sapiens: The New Science of Plant Intelligence.

In this episode, we focus on Planta Sapiens. We start by discussing what intelligence means, and how to maintain some degree of skepticism when it comes to comparing plants to animals. We talk about how plants behave, cognitive behavior, how they learn, how they communicate, differences between domesticated plants and wild plants, and plant biochemistry. We discuss whether plants can have minds, and whether they can experience emotions, pain, and consciousness. Finally, we talk about the potential ethical implications.
