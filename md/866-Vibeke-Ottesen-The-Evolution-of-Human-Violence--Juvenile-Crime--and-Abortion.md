Dr. Vibeke Ottesen is a Norwegian criminologist with an interest in how nature and nurture combined create human behavior. She has a popular science blog – Biosocial - where she comments on news, scientific findings and literature relevant to her subject – more often than not with an evolutionary-informed approach to understanding the subject matter.

In this episode, we start by talking about using animal models to study human violence, and Richard Wrangham’s work on violence. We discuss how much crime is impulsive and how much of it is planned. We talk about juvenile crime, and the risk factors associated with it. We discuss how the media misrepresent crime, and common misconceptions about the perpetrators. We talk about the link between economic inequality and crime. Finally, we discuss common misconceptions surrounding abortion.
