RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 7th 2020.  
Dr. Warren Brown is Director of the Lee Edwards Travis Research Institute and Professor of Psychology in the Department of Doctoral Psychology at Fuller Theological Seminary. Currently, he is most actively involved in neuroscience research in two areas: (1) the cognitive and psychosocial disabilities in a congenital brain malformation called agenesis of the corpus callosum, and (2) the consequences in adults of a childhood hemispherectomy for the control of seizures. Brown has also studied functioning of the corpus callosum in dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease, and he has done research on brain wave changes associated with aging and dementia, language comprehension, dialysis treatment for kidney disease, and attention deficits in schizophrenia. Dr. Brown has authored or coauthored over 75 scholarly articles in such peer-reviewed scientific journals as Neuropsychologia, Psychophysiology, Biological Psychiatry, Developmental Neuropsychology, Cortex, Nature Review Neuroscience, and Science; 15 chapters in edited scholarly books; and over 150 presentations at scientific meetings.

In this episode, we tackle some major theoretical questions in neuroscience. We discuss mind-brain dualism, reductionism and emergentism, embodied cognition, causality, and determinism and free will. We also talk about Dr. Brown’s research on the agenesis of the corpus calossum, the neuroscience of religion, and the relationship between science and religion.
