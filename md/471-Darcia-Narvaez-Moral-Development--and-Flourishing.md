In this episode, we talk about moral development. First, we define morality, and talk about the concept of the “evolved nest”. We ask if morality is innate, and discuss moral foundations theory and its limitations. We get into moral development, and talk about the role of genetics, the parents, and the wider community. We talk about multiples inheritances genes, epigenetics, developmental plasticity, basic needs, the microbiome, local and macro ecological heritages). We mention the importance of social interaction in child development. We discuss human flourishing, and what we can learn from indigenous societies. Finally, we talk about studying human behavior through a multidisciplinary approach.
