Dr. Stephen Hicks teaches at Rockford University, where he also directs the Center for Ethics and Entrepreneurship. He is the author of books like Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, and Nietzsche and the Nazis.

Dr. Hicks is a return guest on the show. Please go check out our first conversation, “Postmodernism: From Rousseau to the Present”: https://youtu.be/rBTPMBKCZLs

In this episode, we focus on Nietzsche’s philosophy, and some of Dr. Hicks’ views about it, as exposed in his book, “Nietzsche and the Nazis”. As the title of the book implies, we talk about how Nietzsche might have influenced the German National-Socialist political ideology, and, toward the end, we also get a little bit into the connections between Nazism and Postmodernism, and how Nietzsche was one of the major influences in both these political opposite ideologies. Specific topics include Nietzsche’s reactionary views against the values of the Enlightenment, namely rationality and objectivity, individualism, progress, and science as whole.
