RECORDED ON DECEMBER 7th 2021.  
Dr. Henrik Høgh-Olesen is Professor of Psychology at Aarhus University. His research interests include Evolutionary psychology, Comparative psychology/Ethology, Primatology, Aesthetics, Psychology of religion, and History of psychology. He is the author of 13 scientific books, including The Aesthetic Animal.

In this episode, we focus on The Aesthetic Animal. We talk about the aesthetic impulse, and the evolution of art and aesthetic appreciation. We also discuss individual differences in art appreciation. We go through the evolution and social functions of body ornamentation, song, dance, music, and fiction. We talk a bit about the neuroscience of aesthetics, and the role existential uncertainty might play in art production. Finally, we talk about how we can improve human wellbeing by learning more about our “aesthetic impulse”, mostly through architecture.
