RECORDED ON JULY 26th 2021.  
Dr. Orestis Palermos is Lecturer in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University. He works at the intersection of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of technology. He is interested in the idea of philosophical engineering: the way philosophy can impact the design of emerging technologies and socio-technical systems.

In this episode, we talk about epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of technology. We distinguish between internalism and externalism in epistemology, and then talk about extended and distributed cognition. We talk about social epistemology, and different kinds of technologies that allow for extended cognition. We ask if students should be allowed to use Google in their exams. We discuss how we should think about culture in terms of epistemology. We discuss how science works. Finally, we talk about philosophical engineering.
