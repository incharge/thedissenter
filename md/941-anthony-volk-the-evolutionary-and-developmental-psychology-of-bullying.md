RECORDED ON DECEMBER 15th 2023.  
Dr. Anthony Volk is Professor in the Department of Child and Youth Studies, and Associate Member in the Department of Psychology at Brock University. He is a developmental scientist interested in the separate, but related, areas of bullying, parenting, personality, psychopathy, and the evolution of childhood. A strong believer in multidisciplinary studies, Prof. Volk’s overall interest is to gain an evolutionary, psychological, biological, neurological, health-based, Indigenous, cross-cultural, social, historical, and (if possible) transdisciplinary understanding of why individuals do what they do.

In this episode, we talk about bullying from an evolutionary and developmental perspective. We discuss adolescent bullying, and how it differs from bullying in other stages of life. We talk about the personality traits of bullies; the evolutionary advantages of bullying; imbalances of power; who the victims of bullying are; psychopathy and psychopathology in bullying; whether the way schools are structured contributes to bullying; when and why people intervene in bullying incidents; interventions to reduce bullying; and classroom incivility. Finally, Dr. Volk answers questions from a patron regarding life history theory.
