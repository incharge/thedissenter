RECORDED ON MARCH 22nd 2022.  
Dr. Steven Frank is Donald Bren Professor & UCI Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. His areas of expertise are evolutionary genetics, host-parasite interactions and social evolution. He is the author of books like Foundations of Social Evolution, Immunology and Evolution of Infectious Disease, and more recently, Microbial Life History: The Fundamental Forces of Biological Design.

In this episode, we focus on Microbial Life History. We start with general questions related to biological design; three fundamental forces of design: marginal values; reproductive values; generalized kin selection; evolutionary and organismal responses to the environment; how to know what selective pressures produce a trait; predicting changes in traits; the origins versus the modification of traits; genetic and phenotypic changes; the evolution of phenotypic plasticity; and adaptationism. We then talk about aspects of microbial metabolism, like growth; thermodynamics; flux; and enzyme catalysts. Finally, we discuss the principles of biological design.
