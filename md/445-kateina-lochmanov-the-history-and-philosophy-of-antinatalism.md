RECORDED ON DECEMBER 28th 2020.  
Kateřina Lochmanová is currently finishing her postgraduate studies of philosophy at the University of Ostrava, where she graduated with a diploma thesis entitled Iracionality of a Wager on Life in the Context of Benatar’s Antinatalism. She is one of the coorganisators of conferences on antinatalism in Ostrava as well as in Prague (with Vlastimil Vohánka, Filip Svoboda, David Černý and Tomáš Hříbek). At present, she is primarily concerned with geometry and metaphysics of space by a German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, but peripherally she is still interested in the subject of antinatalism too, especially in (the history of) Benatar’s asymmetry argument. She is the editor of History of Antinatalism: How Philosophy Has Challenged the Question of Procreation.

In this episode, we focus on History of Antinatalism, and aspects of its philosophy. We start with the history, and then get into topics like the philosophy of Schopenhauer and David Benatar; the human condition; promortalism; abortion; human extinction; pronatalism; homicide; euthanasia; and nihilism.
