RECORDED ON April 29th 2020.  
Dr. Colin Holbrook is Assistant Professor of Cognitive and Information Sciences at the University of California Merced. He researches decision-making under contexts of threat, with particular focus on political orientation, group prejudice, and the representation of mental states.

In this episode, we focus on the psychology of threat, threat detection, threat salience, and response to threat. We first ask what threat is really about, and the kinds of threat that exist, as well as how people respond to it. We also talk about how threat might change group dynamics of competition and cooperation, and the effects that religiousness has on the psychological impact of threat. Finally, we mention some of the topics that Dr. Holbrook is exploring in the domain of human-robot interaction, something that, if all goes well, we will be digging deeper later this year.
