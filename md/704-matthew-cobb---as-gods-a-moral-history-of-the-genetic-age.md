RECORDED ON OCTOBER 26th 2022.  
Dr. Matthew Cobb is a Professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Manchester, where his research focuses on the sense of smell, insect behavior and the history of science. He is also a historian of the French Resistance. He’s the author of several books, including As Gods: A Moral History of the Genetic Age.

In this episode, we focus on As Gods. We first talk about the history of humans altering genomes, and the advent of genetic engineering. We discuss why geneticists paused their work in the 1970s, and new protocols in laboratory research. We go through different types of technology, like genetically modified organisms (GMOs), gene therapy, and gene drives. We talk about another pause in 2012, and a development in 2019. Finally, we discuss how the press communicates about genetic engineering.
