RECORDED ON DECEMBER 30th 2022.  
Dr. Jordi Camí is Professor of Pharmacology (specialist in Clinical Pharmacology) at Pompeu Fabra University, General Director of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), and Director of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation.   
Dr. Luis Miguel Martínez is Head of the Laboratory of Visual Analogy at the Neuroscience Institute of Alicante.  
They are both authors of The Illusionist Brain: The Neuroscience of Magic.

In this episode, we focus on The Illusionist Brain. We talk about magic from the perspective of neuroscience, and explore aspects of human cognition like the visual system, memory, attention, change blindness, decision-making, and the cultural context. We discuss if people in industrialized societies are less susceptible to magic, how technology influences the development of magic, and if magicians are scientists. Finally, we talk about why magic is an ecologically valid way of studying human cognition.
