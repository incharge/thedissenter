Dr. Gerard Saucier is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon. He won the 1999 Cattell Early Career Research Award from the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology. His research focuses on Personality Psychology, Values, Cultural Psychology, Moral Psychology, and Political Psychology. Dr. Saucier has been a leader in developing and refining dimensional models for personality (the Big Five, and upgrading from the Big Five to a more comprehensive Big Six model and a broader, more universal 'Big Two') and beliefs and values (e.g., dimensions of ‘isms’).

In this episode, we talk about personality psychology, and the Big Five, Big Six and HEXACO personality traits inventories, and the Big Two. We start off with an overview of the historical and scientific importance of the development of the Big Five personality traits to personality psychology, and the scientific rationale behind them, the lexical hypothesis/rationale. Then, we discuss the Big Six and the HEXACO, and how these inventories are arrived at. We also talk about what would be the goals of the development of these inventories, with special emphasis on universality and predictive ability. We discuss briefly the ten aspects of the Big Five, and then finish off by talking about the application of these inventories to clinical psychology, and the ways by which culture might influence personality traits and how they get expressed.
