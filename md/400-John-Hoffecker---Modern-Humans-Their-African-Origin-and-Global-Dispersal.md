RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 25th 2020.  
Dr. John Hoffecker is Fellow of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR). He specializes in archaeology and human paleoecology. His primary research focus is the global dispersal of anatomically modern humans, which began more than 50,000 years ago in Africa. He is the author of several books, including Modern Humans: Their African Origin and Global Dispersal (2017).

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Hoffecker’s book. We cover some of the major topics of the book, including: the importance of the human hand and the vocal tract in our evolution, and particularly for the development of culture; what are modern humans; Out of Africa migrations for both species before and after H. sapiens; the technology H. sapiens needed for the migrations to be possible; the evolution and interaction with Neanderthals and Denisovans; the origins of H. sapiens; the reasons behind the migrations; the extinction of megafauna; and human geographic races.
