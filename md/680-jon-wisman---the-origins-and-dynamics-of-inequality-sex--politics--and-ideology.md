Dr. Jon Wisman is Professor of Economics at American University in Washington, DC. He teaches graduate courses in the history of economic thought and economic methodology and undergraduate courses in macroeconomics, European economic history, American economic history, economic development, and labor economics. He is the author of The Origins and Dynamics of Inequality: Sex, Politics, and Ideology.

In this episode, we focus on The Origins and Dynamics of Inequality. We first talk about the different kinds of inequality addressed in the book. We discuss the account of inequality presented in the book, and how it differs from the ones put forth by other economists. We get into the evolutionary bases of inequality, focusing on sexual selection, and the relationship between mating systems and inequality. We walk through inequality in forager societies, the early agricultural states, and European feudalism. We talk about ideology, legitimation theory, and the role of religion. We discuss the advent of Protestantism, and the rise of a new ideology. We talk about how workers gained formal political power starting in the 19th century. We go through the Great Depression and a decline in inequality between the 1930s and the 1970s; and the political and economic changes in the 70s, and the levels of inequality we see today. Finally, we discuss the future of inequality, and possible solutions.
