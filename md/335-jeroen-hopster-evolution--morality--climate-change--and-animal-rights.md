RECORDED ON April 7th, 2020.  
Dr. Jeroen Hopster was a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University, and now he is doing research on climate ethics at the University of Graz. In February 2019 he defended his dissertation 'Moral Objectivity: Origins and Foundations'. 

In this episode, we focus mostly on moral realism. We ask what it really is about, and what an evolutionary perspective brings to the table. We also discuss in what ways morality can be objective. And we deal with specific applied ethics topics, like climate ethics, the ethics of pandemics applied specifically to covid-19, and animal rights.
