RECORDED ON APRIL 12th 2022.  
Dr. Niamh McLoughlin is a Lecturer in Developmental Psychology at University of Kent. She studies how social information impacts young children’s cognition, evaluations and behavior.

In this episode, we talk about children’s social cognition. We first discuss how early children start processing social information, and then go through topics like religiosity and religious beliefs; believing in the content of stories; inferring causal relations; mental state talk, and theory of mind; the development of group affiliations; dehumanization; and interventions to promote prosocial behavior toward out-group members.
