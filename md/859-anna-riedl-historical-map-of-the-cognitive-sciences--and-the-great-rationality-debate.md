RECORDED ON OCTOBER 31st 2023.  
Anna Riedl is a cognitive scientist, specialized in rational decision-making. She is an active public speaker and science communicator. She was a researcher at the Viennese Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support. Anna is also a member of the Global Shapers Community organized by the World Economic Forum and served as curator for the Vienna Hub.

In this episode, we start by talking about Anna’s Historical Map of (the) Cognitive Science(s) project. We discuss what counts as cognitive science, and go through some of the big theories and paradigms in cognitive science from the 19th century to the 21st century. We then talk about the Great Rationality Debate, and discuss topics like biases and heuristics, ecological rationality, and relevance realization. We also discuss whether rationality is mostly an individual or a social phenomenon, whether the rationality debate might have daily life applications, and the current state and future of the debate.
