In this episode, we focus on Free Speech. We start by defining free speech, and then walk through free speech in different domains, like politics, universities, the arts, and civil society. We talk specifically about free speech on social media in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. We discuss ways in which free speech is under threat, and historical precedents to it.
