Dr. Ian Crawford is Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck College, University of London. His research activities mostly lie in the fields of space exploration (especially lunar science and exploration), and the science of astrobiology (the search for life in the Universe).

In this episode, we talk about astrobiology and Big History. What is astrobiology, and the criteria that are used to search for life in the Universe, and also the limitations of those criteria, including the Goldilocks conditions (or the habitable zone). Also, the life forms that we should expect to find on other planets, and the places in our solar system which have the highest probabilities of hosting life. The special case of looking for intelligent life, and the many complications of it. The scientific, societal and political relevance of lunar and space exploration, and why it’s not in conflict with other human social and political endeavors. And, finally, Big History, and the relationship between astrobiology and Big History.
