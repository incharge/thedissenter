Nicole Barbaro is currently a PhD student in evolutionary psychology at Oakland University, studying under the advisement of Todd K. Shackelford. She serves as the Student Representative of the Executive Council for the Human Behavior and Evolution Society. She also serves on the Editorial Board as a Review Editor for Frontiers in Psychology, Evolutionary Psychology, as well as a Section Editor for the Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science. Her interests are in human sexual psychology and behavior, including application of life history theory and sperm competition theory.

In this episode, our discussion is focused on human mating, life history theory, attachment theory and attachment styles, and also mate guarding and mate retention strategies. We first refer to the many dimensions of human mating, and the innate and environmental aspects of it. Then, we talk about the types of attachment that we have, and how they related to how we establish romantic relationships. We also refer to the specific case of coalitional mate retention strategies. Finally, we discuss the role of marriage and children in romantic relationships, and pair-bonding, parental investment and cooperative breeding in humans.
