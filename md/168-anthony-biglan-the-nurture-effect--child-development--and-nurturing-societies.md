Dr. Anthony Biglan is a Senior Scientist at Oregon Research Institute and the Co-Director of the Promise Neighborhood Research Consortium. He has been conducting research on the development and prevention of child and adolescent problem behavior for the past several decades. His work has included studies of the risk and protective factors associated with tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; high-risk sexual behavior; and antisocial behavior. He and colleagues at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences published a book summarizing the epidemiology, cost, etiology, prevention, and treatment of youth with multiple problems, called Helping Adolescents at Risk (2004). He is a former president of the Society for Prevention Research. He was a member of the Institute of Medicine Committee on Prevention. He’s also the author of The Nurture Effect: How the Science of Human Behavior Can Improve Our Lives and Our World.

In this episode, we focus on some of the main topics of Dr. Biglan’s book, The Nurture Effect. We refer to the role of evolution in the behavioral sciences, and to aspects of the environment from families to schools and societies, and the negative effects of coercive environments. We also discuss specifically addictive behaviors involving tobacco, alcohol and drugs, risky sexual behavior, and anti-social behavior. In the latter part of the interview, we also talk about cultural evolution, psychological flexibility, and their relationship to the development of nurturing societies.
