Dr. Suthan Krishnarajan is Associate Professor in Political Science at Aarhus University. His research agenda seeks to understand and explain political regime instability. Broadly speaking, a political regime is the rules that determine who can access power, and how, in a given country. In democracies, leaders are chosen in competitive, free, and fair elections; in autocracies, leaders access power through alternative means. In his research, he examines why such regimes sometimes endure and at other times break down. I do so from three traditional disciplines in political science: comparative politics, public opinion, and international relations.

In this episode, we talk about regime instability in democracies and autocracies. We start by defining democracy. We talk about how people form democratic support. We discuss if citizens in Western democracies support democracy, and how satisfied they are with it. We talk about when people support undemocratic behavior, and how they rationalize it. We discuss evidence-based interventions to improve citizens’ democratic values. We discuss if national elections are unequivocally good for people’s satisfaction with democracy. We talk about factors that lead to democratic breakdown, including economic crises. Finally, we discuss how autocratic leaders deal with regime instability and coup attempts.
