RECORDED ON OCTOBER 27th 2023.  
Dr. Caleb Everett is a Senior Associate Dean in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Miami and a Professor in the Anthropology Department, with a secondary appointment in Psychology. He is a member of the inaugural class of Andrew Carnegie Fellows. His work explores language, cognition and behavior across the world's cultures. His latest book is A Myriad of Tongues: How Languages Reveal Differences in How We Think. 

In this episode, we focus on A Myriad of Tongues. We discuss how sometimes people assume too much universality in language, and where linguistic diversity stems from. We explore how people talk about time, numbers, space and directions, social relationships, and colors and odors. We discuss how the environment influences the evolution of languages, focusing on the example of extreme ambient aridity, and also whistled languages. We talk about the limitations of studying grammatical patterns in idealized and written sentences. We discuss whether words are arbitrary, and if we can accurately translate every word and expression. Finally, we discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and the broader study of universality and diversity in human cognition.
