Dr. Joseph Henrich is Professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He is interested in the question of how humans evolved from "being a relatively unremarkable primate a few million years ago to the most successful species on the globe", and how culture affected our genetic development. He is also the author of The Secret of Our Success, and The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous.

In this episode, we start by talking about how culture shapes human psychology; human universals, and cognitive phenotypes; how different fields reacted to the WEIRD problem; and the replication crisis. We discuss how to understand biases, like the prestige bias. We talk about what drives innovation, and cumulative culture. We discuss the collective brain hypothesis, and reframing how we think about intelligence and IQ. We talk about assortative mating, human mating systems, and the relationship between polygyny and inequality. We discuss religion, Big Gods, and theory of mind. We talk about the best methods to study psychology historically. Finally, we discuss if we rely too much on English speakers in the study of human cognition, and the need for people from more diverse cultural backgrounds in science.
