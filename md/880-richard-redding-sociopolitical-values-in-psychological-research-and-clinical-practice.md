Dr. Richard Redding is Ronald D. Rotunda Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and Professor of Psychology at Chapman University. Dr. Redding's research focuses on forensic issues in criminal law and juvenile justice, the use of social science research in law and public policy, scientific evidence, and legal education.  His work in these areas is both theoretical or policy-oriented and empirical. 

In this episode, we talk about sociopolitical values and diversity in psychological research and clinical practice. We start by discussing the psychology of sociopolitical values, how they relate to personality traits, and how sociopolitical values can impact research. We then get into how to deal with conflicting sociopolitical values in clinical practice.
