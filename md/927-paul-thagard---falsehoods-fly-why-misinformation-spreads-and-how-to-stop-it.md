RECORDED ON MARCH 6th 2024.  
Dr. Paul Thagard is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Waterloo and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the Cognitive Science Society, and the Association for Psychological Science. The Canada Council awarded him a Molson Prize (2007) and a Killam Prize (2013). He is a philosopher, cognitive scientist, and author of many interdisciplinary books, the latest one being Falsehoods Fly: Why Misinformation Spreads and How to Stop It.

In this episode, we focus on Falsehoods Fly. We start by distinguishing information from misinformation, and we discuss why we should worry about misinformation. We talk about the AIMS Theory of Information and Misinformation. We discuss cognitive errors and motivated cognition. We talk about the reliability of news sources, and go through several examples of misinformation, namely medical misinformation and the COVID-19 pandemic; scientific misinformation and climate change; conspiracy theories; political misinformation, and misinformation about inequality; and misinformation on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Finally, we discuss how we can prevent misinformation, and how this book connects to Dr. Thagard’s The Cognitive Science of Science.
