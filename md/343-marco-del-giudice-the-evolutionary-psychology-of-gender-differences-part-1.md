RECORDED ON April 22nd, 2020.  
Dr. Marco Del Giudice is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of New Mexico. In his work he explores a wide range of topics at the intersection of human behavior, evolution, and development. His approach is interdisciplinary and driven by the quest for theoretical synthesis. Over the years he has developed some broad, integrative models: the Adaptive Calibration Model of individual differences in stress responsivity (with Bruce Ellis and Birdie Shirtcliff); an evolutionary-developmental model of sex differences in attachment styles; and a unifying life history framework for evolutionary psychopathology. Most of his current empirical work is devoted to testing, advancing, and refining these models with a variety of research methods. He’s the author of Evolutionary Psychopathology: A Unified Approach.

In this episode, we focus on psychological gender differences. We talk about personality and risk-taking; univariate and multivariate analyses; the interpersonal circumplex model; cooperation and competition; and gender differences in verbal and non-verbal communication.   
This is a 2-part talk on gender differences. The second part will probably be released in August 2020.
