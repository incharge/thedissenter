RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2021.  
Dr. Jennifer Sheehy-Skeffington is Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. She is a social psychologist interested in the mechanisms underlying our human sensitivity to power, status, and group membership: their origins, interactions, and manifestation in societal context.

In this episode, we talk about evolutionary and social psychology. We discuss if humans are a hierarchical species, and how to understand power and status from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about group identity, and how people form it. We get into social dominance orientation, how it shapes our worldview, and is relationship with political ideology. We talk about the effects of poverty on human psychology, and how people perceive social inequality. We touch on the psychological effects of the 2008 economic crisis, and the potential ones we can see from this pandemic. We wrap things up by discussing how to integrate evolutionary and social psychology.
