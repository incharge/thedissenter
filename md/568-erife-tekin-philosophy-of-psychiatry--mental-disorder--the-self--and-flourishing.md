RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 16th 2021.  
Dr. Şerife Tekin is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Medical Humanities program at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Her work is in philosophy of science/medicine, philosophy of mind/cognitive science and bioethics. It is heavily informed by feminist and social epistemology. She has two co-edited edited books, The Bloomsbury Companion to Philosophy of Psychiatry, and Extraordinary Science and Psychiatry: Responses to the Crisis in Mental Health Research, which adopts a Kuhnian approach to make sense of the existing research landscape in psychiatry.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of psychiatry. We first delve into the biological and cultural aspects of mental disorders. We discuss how important cultural and social factors are for how people deal with mental disorders. We talk about the self and flourishing, and the role they play in a clinical context. We talk about how AI is used to treat mental disorders, and if we should use it. We talk a bit about the mental effects of the covid-19 pandemic, and to what extent it really increased mental illness. Finally, we discuss if psychiatry is a science.
