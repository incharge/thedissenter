Dr. Colin DeYoung is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. In his research in personality psychology, he has examined the theoretical structure of personality and the biological basis of personality.

This is our second talk. You can watch the first one, on the Big Five personality traits, here: https://youtu.be/hVh22rn5doQ

In this episode, we talk about personality and psychopathology. We start by discussing issues with how psychopathology is defined in psychiatry. We discuss whether statistical deviance should be enough to classify something as psychopathology, and the relationship between brain disease and psychopathology. We talk about the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, and approaching psychopathologies as dimensions. We discuss how we can distinguish traits from symptoms, and the risk of iatrogenic effects due to misdiagnosis. We discuss how each of the Big Five personality traits can contribute to psychopathology, and the relationship between cognitive ability and psychopathology. We talk about the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, Cybernetic Theory, and personality traits. Finally, we discuss the current state of the neuroscience of personality.
