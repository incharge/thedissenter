excerpt: Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab & Lecturer at
  Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning and
  evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious
  and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies.
  Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth
  School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He
  also co-designed and teaches "Game Theory and Social Behavior" which lays out a
  lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.

Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at MIT Media Lab & Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics. He applies game theory, models of learning and evolution, and experimental methods, to try to decipher the (often subconscious and subtle) incentives that shape our social behavior, preferences, and ideologies. Dr. Hoffman obtained his Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and his B.S. in Economics from the University of Chicago. He also co-designed and teaches "Game Theory and Social Behavior" which lays out a lot of the evidence and models behind this approach.

In this episode, we talk about Game Theory. We first establish the aspects of behavior Game Theory studies, and how it does it, referring to strategies of social interaction studied by Robert Axelrod, which Richard Dawkins talks about in The Selfish Gene. In the second part of the interview, we go through the critiques that Dr. Hoffman made of Evolutionary Psychology (https://twitter.com/Moshe_Hoffman/status/1073270050809937923), focusing on aesthetics, religion, and social norms and morality.
