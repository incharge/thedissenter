Her research interests include Healthspan Pharmacology: the impact of botanical extracts and dietary supplements on longevity and health; Anti-Aging Pharmacology; and Preventive Medicine. She is the author of The Truth About Dietary Supplements: An Evidence-Based Guide to a Safe Medicine Cabinet.

In this episode, we focus on The Truth About Dietary Supplements. We start by talking about Dr. Jafari’s academic background, and what led her to writing this book. We then get into dietary supplements: what they are; who makes and sells them; if they are regulated and tested; and the reporting of adverse side effects. We ask if people generally need supplements. We talk about botanicals used in traditional societies. We discuss issues with the ingredients of supplements, and potential interactions with medication. We talk about how we can know that a supplement is trustworthy. We go through several communication issues regarding social media, celebrity influencers, anecdotes, and the “wellness industry”. We touch on pet supplements. Finally, we talk about how to know if one has some deficiency, what to ask healthcare providers about supplements, and how to monitor the effects of dietary supplements.
