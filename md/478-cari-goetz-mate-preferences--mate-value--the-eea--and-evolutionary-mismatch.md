RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 18th 2021.  
Dr. Cari D. Goetz is Associate Professor of Psychology at California State University, San Bernardino. She does research in Evolutionary Psychology, specifically human mating strategies and mating-related psychology.

In this episode, we go through some topics in evolutionary psychology: sex differences in mate preferences; cues of sexual exploitability, and who responds to them more strongly; mate value discrepancies, and their impact on romantic relationships; and concepts like the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA) and evolutionary mismatch.
