In this episode, we focus on Disruption. We first define disruption, and discuss the factors and causes of disruption. We go through several examples of historical disruptions, like the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire, Mohammad and the spread of Islam, Christianity in Europe and the Holy Roman Empire, the Protestant Reformation, the American and the French revolutions, and more recent disruptions, like the Bolshevik revolution and the Nazi regime. Finally, we talk about possible contemporary disruptions, and how to deal with them.
