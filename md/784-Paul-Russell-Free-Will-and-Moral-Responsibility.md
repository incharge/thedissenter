Dr. Paul Russell is Professor of Philosophy at Lund University (half-time appointment since 2018). He also serves as Director of the Lund|Gothenburg Responsibility Project (LGRP). Dr. Russell's interests cover the areas of free will and moral responsibility along with various topics in early modern philosophy.

On the subject of early modern philosophy, he is especially concerned with the philosophy of David Hume and how his philosophy relates to problems of religion and atheism.

In this episode, we talk about free will and moral responsibility. We start by talking about how to approach free will from the perspective of Philosophy, and we discuss the necessary conditions for its existence. We talk about the relationship between free will and moral responsibility. We address the challenge of skepticism. We discuss moral sentiments, and how they connect to questions of moral responsibility. Finally, we talk about reactive attitudes, blame, punishment, and retribution; and how people who do wrong can be morally motivated.
