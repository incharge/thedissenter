In this episode, we talk about theoretical psychology. We start by discussing what a theory is, and whether data themselves can yield theories. We talk about the notion of “myth”. We discuss where we derive our philosophical/ontological conditions for truth from, and why it is so hard for psychologists to look critically at their own theories. We talk about different uses of theory, and what makes for a falsifiable claim. We discuss the similarities between theories and myths. We talk about theorizing, and what it is like to be both an insider and an outsider in a particular field. Finally, we discuss how to think about the replication crisis, and the “inclusion crisis”.
