In this episode, we focus on Psych. We talk about a mechanistic conception of mental life in modern psychology, and the relationship between the mind and the brain. We discuss modularity of mind. We talk about consciousness and its functions. We discuss if Freud’s theories have any scientific value, the insights and limitations of Skinner’s behaviorism, and what we learned from Piaget about child development. We touch on the nature vs. nurture debate. We talk about the relationship between language and thought. We discuss if humans are rational. We talk about relational psychology, and phenomena like racism and ethnocentrism. We talk about individual differences. We discuss what mental illness is, and how we can treat it. Finally, we discuss what a good life for humans is.
