In this episode, we focus on Resetting the Table. We start by framing food consumption as political behavior. We get into some of the most prominent kinds of farming technologies, including organic farming, GMO (genetically modified organism) crops, and indoor farming, and discuss a bit their advantages, disadvantages, and applications. We talk about consuming local. We discuss the connection between food production and the environment. We also discuss the how viable would it be for everyone to become vegan, and if it would be a good solution. Finally, we talk about the main ways we should reset our tables (in the West), and what can be done politically and by individual citizens.
