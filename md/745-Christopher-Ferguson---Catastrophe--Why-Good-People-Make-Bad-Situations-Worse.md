RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 6th 2023.  
Dr. Christopher J. Ferguson is professor of psychology at Stetson University. He is interested in media violence and, in particular, video games. He’s the author of Catastrophe!: How Psychology Explains Why Good People Make Bad Situations Worse.

In this episode, we focus on “Catastrophe!”. We talk about the cognitive biases that people have during emergencies. We get into topics like trends in suicide rates and blaming social media for it, views on relationships between races in the US. We discuss if the idea of the “madness of crowds” is useful, and availability cascades and social contagion. We talk about how the COVID-19 pandemic became another culture war. We also get into terrorism statistics and how people overreact to it, and the causes of violence and its link to mental disorder. We discuss why it is so hard to tackle climate change. Finally, we talk about how we can manage crises better.
