Dr. Paul Bloom is Professor Emeritus at Yale University and Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto. His research explores how children and adults understand the physical and social world, with special focus on language, morality, religion, fiction, and art. His new book is The Sweet Spot: The Pleasures of Suffering and the Search for Meaning.

In this episode, we focus on The Sweet Spot. We start with a few definitions (pleasure, suffering, happiness, and meaning). We then get into topics like: the difference between chosen and unchosen suffering; the relationship between happiness and meaning; motivational pluralism; the difference between suffering for pleasure, and suffering for meaning; the role context plays in how we valuate our experiences; the complicated interplay between pain and pleasure; masochism, self-harm, and BDSM; the state of flow; boredom; the role of imagination; how we derive pleasure from moral punishment; what people find meaningful; narratives and meaning; why are so many people suffering in industrialized societies; the Nozick experience machine, and if it is possible for people to do without suffering; and where we can find the “sweet spot”.
