Dr. Richard Ronay is Associate Professor of Leadership and Management at University of Amsterdam Business School. His research interests include power and status; social hierarchy; leadership; inequality; overconfidence; social intelligence; decision making; evolutionary psychology; and social neuroendocrinology.

In this episode, we focus on human social hierarchies and leadership. We first talk about social hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective, the different kinds of hierarchies that we can establish, and sex differences in competition. Then we discuss leadership, the traits that tend to go along with it, and the role that traits like overconfidence and risk-taking might play. We also refer to the relationship between hierarchy and group effectiveness, and the relationship between reversal learning (the ability to detect changing contingencies) and social success. Finally, we talk about risk-taking as a sexual display strategy.
