Dr. Mattia Riccardi is Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Porto. He does work in the areas of philosophy of mind, Nietzsche’s philosophy, Kant’s philosophy, 19th-century German philosophy, phenomenology, philosophy of perception, and philosophy of action.

In this episode, we focus on Nietzsche’s Philosophical Psychology. Topics include: Nietzsche's approach to psychology, and its “naturalism”; drives and affects; the soul; socialization; consciousness; thoughts and thinking; the self; self-knowledge, and introspection; the Will; free will, and agency; the ideal human type; creating one’s own values; what is most distinct about Nietzsche’s philosophical psychology; and if we would have approved of contemporary scientific psychology.
