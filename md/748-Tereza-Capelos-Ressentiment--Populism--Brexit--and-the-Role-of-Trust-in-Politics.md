Dr. Tereza Capelos is Associate Professor in Political Psychology at the University of Birmingham, Director of the Institute for Conflict Cooperation and Security, and past President of the International Society of Political Psychology (ISPP). Her research focuses on the affective, cognitive and motivational determinants of political judgments. She is particularly interested in the role of emotions and values on political radicalization and tolerance, the formation and updating of institutional and individual reputations and the role of trust and confidence on political accountability attributions.

In this episode, we talk about topics in political psychology. We start with the mechanism of ressentiment, its relationship with anger, and how it manifests itself in politics, including populism. We talk about Brexit, and how affectivity is exploited in political campaigns. Finally, we talk about the role of trust in politics and society, and how institutional reputations are formed and updated.
