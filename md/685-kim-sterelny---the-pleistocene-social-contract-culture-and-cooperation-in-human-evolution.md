RECORDED ON JUNE 3rd 2022.  
Dr. Kim Sterelny is professor of philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences at Australian National University and Victoria University of Wellington. He is the winner of several international prizes in the philosophy of science, and was previously editor of Biology and Philosophy. He is also a member of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He is currently the First Vice President of the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (2020-2023). He is the author of several books, including The Pleistocene Social Contract: Culture and Cooperation in Human Evolution.

In this episode, we focus on The Pleistocene Social Contract. We talk about aspects of the evolution of human social life, like the suppression of dominance hierarchies, direct and indirect reciprocation, cooperation, intergroup violence, cultural learning, human life history, and interactions between residential groups and rates of cultural innovation. We also discuss how human societies scale up, and the transition to agricultural societies, with hierarchy and inequality. Finally, we ask if this knowledge can be applied to social dynamics in industrialized societies.
