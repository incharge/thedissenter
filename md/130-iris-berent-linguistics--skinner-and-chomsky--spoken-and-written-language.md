Dr. Iris Berent is Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, US. Her research examines the nature of linguistic competence, its origins, and its interaction with reading ability. She’s the author of the book The Phonological Mind. She will also be releasing a new book in the near future, The Blind Storyteller. 

In this episode, we talk about what is Linguistics, and how it’s done nowadays; what is innate and learned in language; if we are the only species that has language; why written language is different from spoken language, and why it’s more difficult to learn; and also if language influences how we perceive things in the world.
