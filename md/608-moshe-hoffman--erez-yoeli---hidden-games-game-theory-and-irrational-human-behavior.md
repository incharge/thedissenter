Dr. Moshe Hoffman is a Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and Lecturer at Harvard's Department of Economics.

Dr. Erez Yoeli is a research scientist at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, where he directs the Applied Cooperation Team (ACT). His research focuses on altruism: understanding how it works and how to promote it.

They are both authors of Hidden Games: The Surprising Power of Game Theory to Explain Irrational Human Behavior.

In this episode, we focus on Hidden Games. Topics include: aspects of human behavior that game theory explains; motives and incentives, and why we are oblivious to them; how learning shapes beliefs and tastes; rationality; spillovers; primary and secondary rewards; proximate vs ultimate analyses; the emic-etic distinction; Nash equilibrium; human cooperation; norms and punishment; why we process information according to game-theoretic principles; moral philosophy from a game-theoretic perspective; nudges; and beliefs, and where they come from.
