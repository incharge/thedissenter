RECORDED ON JANUARY 13th 2021.  
Dr. Touré Reed is a professor in the History department at Illinois State University. Dr. Reed earned his BA in American Studies from Hampshire College (Amherst, MA), and his PhD in History from Columbia University (New York, NY). Dr. Reed's research interests center on race, class, and inequality. He’s the author of Toward Freedom: The Case Against Race Reductionism.

In this episode, we focus on Toward Freedom. We go through some of the history of black politics in the US, including slavery, the post-New Deal period, the post-war period, the civil rights movement, Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, Reagan and neoliberalism, and current political movements. We also discuss the relationship between race and class, and race and class reductionism. We also talk about solutions for the social and economic situation Black Americans find themselves in, like affirmative action and reparations, and the Black Lives Matter movement.
