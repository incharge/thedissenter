RECORDED ON JANUARY 27th 2021.  
Dr. Eric Kaufmann is Professor of Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London, UK.  He is principally interested in cultural politics: ethnicity, national identity and religion. He’s the author of Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities.

In this episode, we focus on Whiteshift. First, Dr. Kaufmann tells us about the main thesis of the book. We discuss the relationship between ethnicity and culture, and the relationship between ethnic identity and politics. We go through some of the factors behind the rise of the populist right, including the migration crisis, Muslim terrorism, and the 2008 economic crisis. We talk about different strategies to deal with immigrants. We speculate a bit about the possible future of the European Union. We ask if it is possible to have countries without borders, and if multiculturalism works. We end with a teaser to our possible second conversation, and talk about the relationship between religion and demography.
