RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 4th 2022.  
Dr. Antoine Marie is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, Denmark. He is an evolutionary political psychologist with a background in philosophy, sociology, political science, and social psychology. He conducts cross-cultural psychology experiments and develops evolutionary theory to better understand, and if possible, mitigate, the cognitive biases that arise from people having strong moral convictions on controversial topics, typically in contexts of perceived intergroup conflict.

In this episode, we talk about moral and political psychology. We first discuss morality from an evolutionary perspective, including its social functions. We talk about why people develop strong moral convictions, and the phenomenon of moral rigidity. We discuss if morality translates directly into political attitudes, and the link between dogmaticism and inter-group conflict. We then get into the cognitive foundations of misinformation, and what makes people susceptible to misinformation in the domain of science. Finally, we discuss the psychology of conspiracy theories, and address the potential solution of moralizing the values of evidence-based and logical thinking.
