RECORDED ON JANUARY 25th 2021.  
Dr. Giuliana Spadaro is Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Behavioral and Movement Sciences at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. She is interested in conducting experimental research on prosocial and cooperative behavior. Her PhD project captured this interest, and focused on understanding the relation between institutions, trust, and cooperation among strangers.

In this episode, we talk about trust and cooperation. We define trust, and talk about trust and cooperation among strangers. We discuss individual differences in trust, and trust on an individual and societal level. We explore why different countries have different levels of interpersonal trust, differences in trust between individualistic and collectivistic societies, and the economic and social outcomes associated with it. We discuss if different groups of migrants show different levels of trust toward native people, and if they adapt to the society they migrate to across generations. We talk about the personality traits associated with prosocial behavior. We refer to the bystander effect, and the explanations behind it. Finally, we ask if it is possible to increase levels of interpersonal trust.
