Dr. Jonathon Crystal is Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University. His research focuses on developing animal models of cognition. His current work focuses on episodic memory, source memory, and prospective memory in rats. He has also developed rodent models to assess retrieval practice, working memory, and metacognition. He is currently the Editor of Learning & Behavior, and he recently served as President of the Comparative Cognition Society. 

In this episode, we talk about studying memory in nonhuman animals, primarily in rats. First, we talk about ways of classifying different types of memory. We then get into how Dr. Crystal designs experiments to study different types of memory and know if they even exist in other animals, including episodic memory and prospective memory. Toward the end, we also refer to metacognition.
