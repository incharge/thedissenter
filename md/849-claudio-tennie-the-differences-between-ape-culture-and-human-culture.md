RECORDED ON JUNE 6th 2023.  
Dr. Claudio Tennie is a Tenured Research Group Leader (“Tools and Culture among Early Hominins”) in the Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of Tübingen. In addition, he is an adjunct scientist at the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes. His main research triangulates what (if anything) makes human cognition unique - as well as why (and relatedly, when this happened and how often). In particular, he uses various methods and pathways to study the factors and the prehistorical beginnings that enabled the typical modern human "variant of culture": cumulative culture of know-how.

In this episode, we talk about ape culture. We start by defining it, and discuss if it is similar or different to human culture. We talk about studies done in captivity versus the ones done in the wild. We discuss the differences between ape culture and human culture, and focus on supra-individual know-how. We discuss what we can learn from these questions. We talk about the “similarity hypothesis", and why is it important to study unenculturated and untrained apes. We discuss the work of Cecilia Heyes and its potential implications for the study of culture. We talk about tasks commonly used to study ape social learning, and what we can learn from them. Finally, we discuss if we know where the differences in the cultures between humans and apes come from.
