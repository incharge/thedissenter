RECORDED ON JANUARY 24th 2022.  
Dr. John Baird Callicott is Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus and a member of the Department of Philosophy and Religion and the Institute of Applied Sciences at the University of North Texas. He is a philosopher whose work has been at the forefront of the new field of environmental philosophy and ethics.  He is the author of books like In Defense of the Land Ethic, Encyclopedia of Environmental Ethics and Philosophy, and Greek Natural Philosophy: The Presocratics and Their Importance for Environmental Philosophy.

In this episode, we talk about environmental philosophy. We start by exploring what environmental philosophy is, a bit of its history, and the questions it deals it. We then focus on environmental ethics, and paradigms like evolutionary moral psychology and rational individualism. We discuss the relationship between environmental ethics and environmental science. We talk about climate change, solutions to it, the role of philosophers, and if we can be optimistic about it. Finally, we ask what we can learn from Eastern philosophy.
