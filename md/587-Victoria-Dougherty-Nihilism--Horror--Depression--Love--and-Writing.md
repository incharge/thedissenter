This is our third talk, and the most philosophical one to date.  
In this episode, we talk about Fernando Pessoa, nihilism; if fictional writing is honest and truthful; how writing fiction can help you understand different people and their personalities; the horror genre, Ingmar Bergman, and the fear of estrangement; what it’s like living with depression; the importance of romantic relationships; Victoria’s influences in her writing; the limitations of writing in comparison to other arts; how comic books can be so great; and how we always get boring parts in stories; and why I only write when I’m in love.
