RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 25th 2021.  
Dr. Erik Kimbrough is an associate professor of economics at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy in the Argyros School of Business and Economics at Chapman University. His research uses experiments to explore the underpinnings of prosociality, cooperation and conflict resolution and to identify the origins of economic institutions such as property rights. He has also worked on finding ways to increase the supply of transplantable organs, measuring the spitefulness of individuals, understanding the sources of asset price bubbles, evaluating individual theory of mind, and capturing the discovery process underlying specialization and trade, among other topics.

In this episode, we talk about behavioral economics. We start with norms, their origins, and why do people follow them. We also talk about institutions, personal and impersonal exchange, specialization, and theory of mind. Toward the end, we talk about organ donations, and adolescent smoking.
