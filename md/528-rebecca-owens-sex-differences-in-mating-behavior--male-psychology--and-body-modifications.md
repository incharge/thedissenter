RECORDED ON JUNE 15th 2021.  
Dr. Rebecca Owens is Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Sunderland. She is also a Chartered member of the British Psychological Society and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Her interests include mating behaviors, preferences, and strategies; male psychology; and body image/identity and wellbeing. 

In this episode, we talk about sex differences in mating behavior, male psychology, and the psychology of body modifications. We first discuss sex differences in mating strategies and mate preferences, for both short-term and long-term relationships. We then get into male psychology, and discuss the effects of testosterone and how it varies in romantic relationships. We discuss aggression, and the misconceptions people hold about aggressive males, and issues regarding domestic violence. We also talk about sex differences in competition. We ask about the psychological impact of gender roles, and if the concept of “toxic masculinity” is useful in any way. Finally, we talk about the psychology of body modifications, and their impact on mental wellbeing.
