RECORDED ON OCTOBER 5th 2020.  
Dr. Jeff McMahan is White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He specializes in Practical Ethics, Political Philosophy, and Ethics. He’s the author of books like The Morality of Nationalism, The Ethics of Killing: Problems at the Margins of Life, and Killing in War.

In this episode, we focus on the killing in war, and the ethics of vegetarianism/veganism. About killing in ward, we address questions like what is a just and an unjust war, the circumstances where soldiers are morally justified to kill other soldiers, excusable conditions for participating in war, when civilians might be liable to being targeted by soldiers, coercion, and teaching moral philosophy to soldiers. In the second part, we discuss the ethics of vegetarianism, and we go through different objections to it, like the pleasure we derive from eating meat, the possibility of the extinction of farm animals, and raising animals in a humane way. We also talk about eating already dead animals, cannibalism, and lab-grown meat.
