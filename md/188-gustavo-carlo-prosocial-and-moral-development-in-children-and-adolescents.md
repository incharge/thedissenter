Dr. Gustavo Carlo is Millsap Professor of Diversity in the Department of Human Development and Family Science at the University of Missouri. His research areas and interests include: Prosocial and moral development among children and adolescents; Temperament, family correlates, social cognition and emotions, and culture-related variables associated with such development; and Positive health and adjustment among Latino families and youth. He’s also been the recipient of several awards, including the 2017 Top Faculty Achiever from the University of Missouri, and the 2018 Outstanding Mentor Award from the Society for Research on Adolescence.

In this episode, we focus on prosocial and moral development in children and adolescents. We refer to the important contributions of genes and the environment, and the many complications associated with studying the different factors; the “stages” approach in developmental psychology; and the development of gender. We also talk about peer pressure, and the shared and non-shared environments; different social cognitions; and, finally, if development still occurs in adulthood.
