RECORDED ON MAY 28th 2021.  
Dr. Andrew Berry is a lecturer in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. He is an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in Alfred Russel Wallace. His research combined field and laboratory methods to detect positive Darwinian selection (i.e. adaptive evolution) at the molecular level in natural populations. He has published two books: Infinite tropics: an Alfred Russel Wallace Anthology, with a foreword written by Stephen Jay Gould, and DNA: The Secret of Life with James Watson.

This is the second part of our 2-part episode on the history of evolutionary theory/biology.   
You can find part 1 here: https://youtu.be/8dFa2Y2XO4k

In this episode, we start with population genetics, its early developments, how it led to the development of inclusive fitness theory, and what happened after the discovery of the double-helix structure of the DNA, what we learn about evolution by natural selection by understanding genetics, and how to detect adaptive evolution on the level of the genome. We then discuss speciation, what we know about it, and some of the controversies there. We address specifically the question of why there are more species more densely packed as one moves from the poles to the Equator. Finally, we talk about what we can learn by studying evolution in islands.
