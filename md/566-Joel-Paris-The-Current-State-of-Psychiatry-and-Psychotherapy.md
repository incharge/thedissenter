RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 10th 2021.  
Dr. Joel Paris is Professor of Psychiatry at McGill University, and Research Associate in the Department of Psychiatry at Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital. His research interests include developmental factors in personality disorders (especially borderline personality), and culture and personality. He’s the author of many books, including An Evidence-Based Critique of Contemporary Psychoanalysis, The Fall of an Icon: Psychoanalysis and Academic Psychiatry, and Fads and Fallacies in Psychiatry.

In this episode, we talk about current issues in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic practice. Topics include: historical fads in psychiatry, and what lessons can be drawn for the present; attempts of current theories to carry out biological reductionism; the dominance of medication in practice; the proliferation of psychotherapies; the belief that the most important psychological risk factor for mental illness is trauma; the idea that mental disorders are mainly due to social and political problems; we talk about overdiagnosis in conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD; problems with the DSM system of classification of disorders; the therapeutic relationship, and its importance in psychotherapy; and if psychiatry is well-equipped to preventing suicide.
