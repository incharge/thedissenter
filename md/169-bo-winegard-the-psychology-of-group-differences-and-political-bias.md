Dr. Bo Winegard is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Marietta College. He generally approaches psychological puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory of natural selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences, individual differences, bias, methods, and political psychology. He’s also the cohost, together with Cory Clark, of the Psyphilopod podcast.

In this episode, we talk about the study of group differences in Psychology. We also discuss the importance of acknowledging the impact of liberal political biases in psychological research, and even research in the social sciences at large, and science denialism by people from both sides of the political spectrum. Toward the end, we discuss some issues in Evolutionary Psychology, like trying to reconcile research on human universals and a panhuman nature perspective with intergroup and interindividual variation, and the strawman arguments drawn against Evolutionary Psychology, and also the way it gets misrepresented in Sex and Gender textbooks.
