RECORDED ON April 17th, 2020.  
Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman is a humanistic psychologist exploring the depths of human potential. He is interested in using his research to help all kinds of minds live a creative, fulfilling, and self-actualized life. He likes to share his enthusiasm of psychology through his teaching, writing, speaking, and podcast. He writes the column Beautiful Minds for Scientific American and hosts The Psychology Podcast, which has received over 10 million downloads. Dr. Kaufman’s writing has appeared in The Atlantic, Psychology Today, and Harvard Business Review. Dr. Kaufman’s books include Wired to Create: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind (with Carolyn Gregoire), Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined, and, as editor, Twice Exceptional: Supporting and Educating Bright and Creative Students with Learning Difficulties and The Cambridge Handbook of Intelligence. His new book is Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization.

In this episode, we focus on Dr. Kaufman’s new book, Transcend. We talk about Mallow’s hierarchy of needs, and how it has been misinterpreted over the years. We refer to transcendence, self-actualization, and humanistic and positive psychology. We refer to how evolutionary psychology has neglected the study of transcendence, and other related topics. We go through different individual differences and how they influence how people approach these needs, including personality differences, differences in IQ and intelligence, and attachment styles. We also mention the dark and light triads of human personality. Finally, we talk about purpose, and humanity’s potential.
