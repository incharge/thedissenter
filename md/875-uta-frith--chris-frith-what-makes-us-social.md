Dr. Uta Frith is Emeritus Professor of Cognitive Development at UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience since 2006. She has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Aarhus at the Interacting Minds Centre from 2007 to 2015. She has been a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the Central European University in Budapest (February - June 2014).

Dr. Chris Frith is Emeritus Professor of Neuropsychology at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London, Visiting Professor at the Interacting Minds Centre at Aarhus University, Research Fellow at the Institute of Philosophy, and Quondam Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

They are authors of “What Makes Us Social?”.

In this episode, we focus on “What Makes Us Social?”. We start by discussing what social cognition is, and then go through topics like learning and imitation; emotions, our need to affiliate, and joint action; predicting other people’s behavior; group identity; reputation; trust; mentalizing; how high-level cognitive processes interact with low-level cognitive processes; consciousness; collective problem-solving; and teaching, cumulative culture, and the role of culture in human cognition. Finally, we discuss how we can foster cooperation.
