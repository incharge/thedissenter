Dr. April Bleske-Rechek is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. As a researcher, she focuses on human mating, friendship, cognitive abilities and intellectual giftedness, and science literacy.  
In this episode, the conversation revolves around the evolutionary psychology of friendship and mate selection. She gives a personal account of the development and importance of evolutionary psychology. And then we move on to talk same-sex and opposite-sex friendship; friendship rivalry and its bases; the evolutionary bases of friendship; sex differences in friendship initiation and dissolution; the studying of friendship and mate preferences; cues and signals in mate selection, and clarifying the difference between waist-to-hip ratio and body mass index; exaggerated physical cues and pornography; the effects of pornography in men’s minds; advantages and disadvantages of sex robots; assortative mating, and its evolutionary advantages; a specific study of Dr. Bleske-Rechek’s involving the trolley problem; the contribution of evolutionary psychology to human relationships; if evolutionary psychology should be the core theory of modern Psychology, and why; if Psychology should be looked at as a branch of Biology; and the relationship between Evolutionary Psychology and Behavioral Genetics.
