RECORDED ON DECEMBER 4th 2020.  
Dr. David C. Lahti is an Associate Professor of Biology at Queens College, City University of New York, where he runs a Behavior & Evolution laboratory. His work focuses on evolutionary and behavioral ecology, especially the evolution of complex and learned traits in birds and humans.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of biology and evolutionary theory. Topics include: complex and learned traits; birds, and the evolutionary insights we can get by studying them; culture from an evolutionary perspective; how species lose traits during evolution; evolutionary ethics; human moral universals; gene-culture coevolution; morality and religion; and progress in evolution.
