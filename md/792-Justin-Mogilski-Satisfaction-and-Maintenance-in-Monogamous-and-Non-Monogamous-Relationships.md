RECORDED ON DECEMBER 21st 2022.  
Dr. Justin Mogilski is Assistant Professor at the University of South Carolina Salkehatchie. His current program of research examines: 1) conflict resolution within consensually non-monogamous (CNM) romantic relationships (e.g., polyamory, open relationships, swinging), 2) how evolution has shaped moral decision-making, and 3) individual differences in predatory intimate relationship behaviors. He currently leads an international team of sexuality and relationship researchers studying CNM relationship maintenance strategies.

In this episode, we talk about romantic relationships. We talk about relationship satisfaction and what predicts it; emotional and sexual accessibility; what consensually non-monogamous relationships are and their different types; jealousy; where conflict arises from in monogamous and non-monogamous relationships; how people deal with jealousy in monogamous vs. non-monogamous relationships; conflict resolution in different kinds of relationships; sex differences in reconciliation behavior after romantic conflict; and the relationship between life history and multi-partner mating. Finally, we discuss why consensual non-monogamy is morally condemned.
