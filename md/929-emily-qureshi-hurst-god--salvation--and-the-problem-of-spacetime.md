RECORDED ON MARCH 28th 2024.  
Dr. Emily Qureshi-Hurst is Stipendiary Lecturer in Philosophy at Oriel College and a Junior Research Fellowship at Pembroke College, University of Oxford. She completed a D.Phil at the University of Oxford in Science and Religion (2021). Her thesis examined the theoretical support for a B-theory of time provided by special and general relativity, and re-interpreted Paul Tillich's doctrine of salvation in light of this metaphysical temporal model. She is the author of God, Salvation, and the Problem of Spacetime.

In this episode, we focus on God, Salvation, and the Problem of Spacetime. We start by talking about the metaphysics of time, and we go through how ancient and medieval philosophers understood time, the link between time and theology, and how people think about time nowadays. We discuss how physics relates to metaphysics, and how spacetime relates to theology. We explore questions related to the nature of God, human salvation, and resurrection. Finally, we discuss whether science and theology can be reconciled.
