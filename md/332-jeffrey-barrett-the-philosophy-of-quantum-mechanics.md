RECORDED ON March 27th, 2020.  
Dr. Jeffrey Barrett is Chancellor’s Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science at the University of California, Irvine. His current research involves two general topics. First, he is interested in attempts to resolve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Second, he is interested in using decision theory and evolutionary game theory to model basic features of empirical and mathematical inquiry. In particular, he has been modeling the coevolution of descriptive language and predictive theory in the context of Skyrms-Lewis sender-receiver games. 

In this episode, we talk about the philosophy of quantum mechanics. First, Dr. Barrett walks us through some of its theoretical bases, and its history starting in the 19th century. We also take the time to talk a bit about how we know something is real in science. Then, we discuss a series of issues and formulations in quantum mechanics, like the measurement problem, the Single-Mind formulation, the Many-Worlds hypothesis, and the Many-Minds formulation of quantum mechanics. We also refer to string theory, and some of its mains problems and limitations. Finally, we ask if quantum mechanics forces us to accept the nature of the world as probabilistic and/or random, and also if we can predict human behavior with Physics theories.
