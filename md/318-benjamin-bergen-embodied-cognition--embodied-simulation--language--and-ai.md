RECORDED ON JANUARY 23rd, 2020.  
Dr. Benjamin Bergen is Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of California San Diego. His research interests include language comprehension and production, including grammar, word meaning, metaphor, profanity, and talking while driving. He’s the author of the books Louder Than Words: The New Science of How the Mind Makes Meaning, and What the F: What Swearing Reveals About Our Language, Our Brains, and Ourselves.

In this episode, we focus on embodied cognition and language. First, we tackle what embodied cognition is about. Then, we get into language (and meaning). We refer to the embodied simulation hypothesis, and to experiments to know the mental simulations people are performing. We also discuss the drawbacks of mentalese (language of thought). We ask if language influences thought, and how. We talk about different cognitive styles – verbalizers, and visualizers – and ask how can we even understand each other. In the final parts of the interview, we talk about how we get from simulations of physical aspects of existence to abstract concepts; what is embodied simulation really good for; and if we can improve AI systems with knowledge from embodied cognition and simulation.
