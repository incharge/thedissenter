RECORDED ON OCTOBER 15th, 2019.  
Dr. David Puts is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Puts studies the neuroendocrine and evolutionary bases of human sexuality and sex differences, with special focus on behavior and psychology. His research topics include the influence of sex hormones on psychology, behavior, and anatomy; hormonal and genetic influences on sexual differentiation; sexual selection and the evolution of sex differences in voices, faces, bodies, brains, and behavior; the development and evolution of variation in sexual orientation; and the evolution of female orgasm. 

In this episode, we talk about some of the major topics of Dr. Puts’ research. First, we discuss sexual selection and how it is essential to learn more about the evolution of human sexual dimorphism. We then talk about sex differences, focusing on the brain and cognition. We also refer to some of the main lines of evidence that point toward a biological basis for these differences. We also go through the biological foundations of sexual orientation, as well as current hypotheses for the evolution of female orgasm.
