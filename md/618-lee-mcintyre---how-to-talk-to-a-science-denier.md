RECORDED ON JANUARY 28th 2022.  
Dr. Lee McIntyre is a Research Fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University. He is interested in comparative methodology across the natural and social sciences. He is the author of books like Post-Truth, and The Scientific Attitude: Defending Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience. His new book is How to Talk to a Science Denier: Conversations with Flat Earthers, Climate Deniers, and Others Who Defy Reason.

In this episode, we focus on How to Talk to a Science Denier. We characterize a science denier, and talk about the five tropes of science denial. We discuss how politics and ideology influence science denial. We talk about the strategies people can use to engage with science deniers. We discuss the social aspects of science denial. We talk about philosophers who deny the epistemology of science. We talk about how science tends to be counterintuitive, and what to do when there is not enough information. We discuss the different types of science deniers. Finally, Dr. McIntyre gives us a guide on how to first approach a science denier.
