Dr. Deborah Carr is a Professor of Sociology and inaugural director of the Center of Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. Her research interests include aging and the life course, psychosocial factors influences on health over the life course, and end-of-life issues. Her latest book is Aging in America.

In this episode, we focus on aging, but also tackle other social issues in the US. We first discuss the obesity “epidemic”, the causes of obesity, and weight stigma. We talk about the relationship between the kinds of physical activity people engage in and perceived health. We discuss the life trajectories and long-term planning of married and single people. We talk about challenges in time management for married couples with children, changes in gender roles, and work-life balance. We discuss challenges disabled people face (during the pandemic, at work, and in old age), and how hard it is being poor/leaving poverty. We talk about racial and ethnic differences in healthcare planning, how perceptions of survival affect it, and end-of-life decisions. Finally, we discuss how widowhood affects people, and the social effects of inequality.
