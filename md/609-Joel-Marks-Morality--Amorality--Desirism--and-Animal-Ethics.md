RECORDED ON JANUARY 7th 2022.  
Dr. Joel Marks is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of New Haven and a Bioethics Center Scholar at Yale University. His main areas of scholarly interest have been theoretical and applied ethics, both having come together in recent years in thinking about animal ethics. Meanwhile a new area of interest is planetary defense (against comets and asteroids). He is the author of several books, including Ethics Without Morals: In Defense of Amorality; It's Just a Feeling: The Philosophy of Desirism; Hard Atheism and the Ethics of Desire: An Alternative to Morality; and Reason and Ethics: The Case Against Objective Value.

In this episode, we talk about morality, amorality, desirism, and animal ethics. We start by asking if morality exists. We discuss the problematic aspects of morality – being angry, hypocritical, arrogant, arbitrary, imprudent, and silly. We talk about the alternative of amorality, and desirism, and how it applies to animal ethics.
