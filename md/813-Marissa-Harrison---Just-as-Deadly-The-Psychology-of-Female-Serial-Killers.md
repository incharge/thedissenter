Dr. Marissa Harrison is Associate Professor of Psychology in the School of Behavioral Sciences and Education, and Interim Chair of Social Sciences and Psychology at Penn State Harrisburg. She is a research psychologist who investigates serial murder, and interest in serial murder, from an evolutionary and other psychological perspectives. She is the author of Just as Deadly: The Psychology of Female Serial Killers.

In this episode, we focus on Just as Deadly. We start by talking about statistics on serial killing, and why the focus tends to be on males. We discuss morbid curiosity, and why some people are interested in serial killing. We then get into psychological factors, like demographic data; development, life events, and trauma; motivations, and the modus operandi; neurological data; and sociocultural factors. We talk about how commentators in the media might misinform people on crime and criminals. Finally, we discuss a possible evolutionary rationale behind female serial killing.
