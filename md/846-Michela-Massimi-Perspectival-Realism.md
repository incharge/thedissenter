RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 1st 2023.  
Dr. Michela Massimi is Professor of Philosophy of Science in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, affiliated with the Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics. She works in the area of history and philosophy of science with a focus on the physical sciences.  She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Astronomical Society, corresponding Member of the Académie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences and elected Member of the Academia Europaea. Dr. Massimi is the recipient of the Royal Society’s Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Medal and Lecture 2017 for her interdisciplinary work and communication of philosophy of science, especially modern physics. Dr. Massimi is the author of several books, including Perspectival Realism, which has won the 2023 Lakatos Award.

In this episode, we focus on Perspectival Realism. We talk about realism in science, the “scientific perspective”, and the perspectival nature in scientific representation. We discuss pluralism in science. We talk about perspectival modelling, and the problem of inconsistent models. We discuss data, phenomena, and their relationship. We talk about natural kinds, and contingentism. Finally, we discuss multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism in science, and whether science is really about knowing what objective reality is.
