RECORDED ON DECEMBER 16th, 2019.  
Dr. Michael Masters is Professor of Anthropology at Montana Tech. His research centers on investigating human ocular, orbital, midfacial, cerebral and neurocranial morphology, and how competition among these features may act to constrain the eye and surrounding ocular tissues during ontogeny, as it relates to the disparate incidence & severity of astigmatism and juvenile-onset myopia. Further research interests center on investigating hominin biocultural evolution, astrobiology, astronomy and the physics of time as they relate to the UFO phenomenon. On that pic, he has written a book, Identified Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the UFO Phenomenon.

In this episode, we focus on the thesis that Dr. Masters puts forward in his book, where he tries to explain the UFO phenomenon as being humans from the future backward time travelling. We go through the unreliability of the personal reports, and why we have to be careful about that. Then we get into the biological anthropology bit, and refer to trends in the evolution of the human body, mostly the head, for the past 6 million years, and how it could continue into the future. We also address the theoretical bases of time travel, and its many complications. Finally, we discuss what people from the future could have to gain from travelling back to the past.
