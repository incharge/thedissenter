RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 1st 2022.  
Dr. Leo Tiokhin is Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at the University of Amsterdam, an Interdisciplinary Research Specialist at Strategic Alliance: TU/e, WUR, UU & UMC Utrecht, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Dr. Tiokhin is a meta-scientist who studies the forces that shape how scientists do their work and make inferences from the populations that they study. Much of his research focuses on how incentive structures affect scientific efficiency and reliability, and how we can improve the recognition and reward structures in science. 

In this episode, we talk about the institution of science and the production of scientific knowledge, with a focus on the social sciences. We start by talking about the study of science as a social phenomenon, incentives structures in science, scientific efficiency and scientific reliability, deception and honesty in academic publishing, and replications. We get specifically into the social sciences, and discuss evolutionary approaches, problems with cross-cultural research, and testing hypotheses. Finally, we talk about scientific models and how they relate to reality, and if potential reforms to science should apply to it generally or to specific fields.
