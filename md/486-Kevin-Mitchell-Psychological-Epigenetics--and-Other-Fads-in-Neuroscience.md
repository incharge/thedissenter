RECORDED ON MARCH 23rd 2021.  
Dr. Kevin Mitchell is Associate Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. He is interested in the development of connectivity in the brain, specifically in how this process is controlled by genes and how mutations in such genes affect the connectivity of neuronal circuits, influence behavior and perception and contribute to disease. His research group uses genetic approaches in the mouse to address these questions, and they are also involved in collaborative research looking at the genetics and phenotypic manifestations of synaesthesia and schizophrenia in humans. He’s the author of Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are.

In this episode, we talk about psychological epigenetics. We first address what is epigenetics, and when people first identified epigenetic mechanisms or theorized about them. We refer to several mechanisms, involving chromatin, methylation, and others. We discuss if epigenetics fits into the larger puzzle of evolutionary theory. We talk about the problems and limitations of studies of transgenerational epigenetics done in mice and humans, and we refer to the Dutch famine and Irish famine studies. We refer to how psychoanalysts deal with epigenetics, and what it would take for a behavior to modify the epigenetic profile of an individual and then get transmitted to their offspring. We mention other fads in neuroscience, like neuroplasticity and mirror neurons. We discuss modularity of mind. Finally, we talk about how the science of epigenetics should be communicated to the general public. We end with a brief teaser to Dr. Mitchell’s next book.
