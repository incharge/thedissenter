Dr. Debra Lieberman is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Miami, US. She recently published a book, Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law.

In this episode, we talk about some of the topics of the book Objection: Disgust, Morality, and the Law. We first discuss what are emotions. Then, we move on to disgust specifically, and what domains it gets applied to. We also talk a bit about kin recognition and incest avoidance. As we finish with how moral norms derived from disgust might have been crystallized in the form of laws.
