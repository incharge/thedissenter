Dr. Cory Clark is an Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at Durham University, UK. Dr. Clark does research in Moral Psychology, Political Psychology, Experimental Philosophy, and Motivated Cognition.   
Dr. Bo Winegard is Assistant Professor of Psychology at Marietta College. He generally approaches psychological puzzles from an evolutionary perspective, applying Darwin's theory of natural selection to the human mind. He focuses mostly on status, group differences, individual differences, bias, methods, and political psychology.   
They are both cohosts of the Psyphilopod podcast.

In this episode, we go over some broad topics in the history of Psychology, and its approaches and theoretical foundations. We start off by asking if Freud really made any significant contributions to the field. Then, we get into how folk psychology intuitions might get in the way of proper research. We discuss the replication crisis, and what it really means. We get into a discussion surrounding mind-brain dualism, and also to what extent conscious processes have any causal powers in people’s psychology and behavior. We also talk about the example of cognitive dissonance and how it has been misinterpreted as a phenomenon by social psychologists. Toward the end, we also have time to put some controversial evolutionary psychology hypotheses on the table.
