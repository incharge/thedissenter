RECORDED ON JANUARY 29th, 2020.  
Max Beilby is a Management and Organizational Psychologist and author of the Darwinian Business blog. He’s currently working as a practitioner in the banking industry.

In this episode, we talk about the application of Evolutionary Psychology to Organizational Psychology. We start by tackling the concept of evolutionary mismatch, and then go through some examples of it that apply to the modern workplace, like Dunbar’s number, leadership and hierarchy, overconfidence, and dissatisfaction, stress, and burnout. We also refer to sex differences and if they have any implications in the workplace. Finally, we discuss possible solutions coming from the knowledge we already have and refer to cultural evolution.
