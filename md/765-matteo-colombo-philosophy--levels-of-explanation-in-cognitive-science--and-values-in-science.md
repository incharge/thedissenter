RECORDED ON DECEMBER 16th 2022.  
Dr. Matteo Colombo is an Associate Professor in the Tilburg Center for Logic, Ethics, and Philosophy of Science, and in the Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University. Much of his work is in the foundations of computational neuroscience, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and moral psychology. He is especially interested in the places where these areas overlap.

In this episode, we talk about topics in neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy of science. We start by talking about experimental philosophy and the questions it deals with. We talk about the relationship between intellectual humility and prejudice. We discuss large-scale brain simulations, what they aim at, and if they have been productive. We address debates in the cognitive sciences like the levels of explanation debate, and the debate between the nativists and the empiricists. We discuss if value-free science is possible; what the appraisal of scientific hypotheses is influenced by; and the relationship between neuroscience, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and moral psychology.
