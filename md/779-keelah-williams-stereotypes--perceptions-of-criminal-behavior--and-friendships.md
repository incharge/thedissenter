RECORDED ON JANUARY 17th 2023.  
Dr. Keelah Williams is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Director of Jurisprudence of Law and Justice Studies at Hamilton College. Her current research explores how the perception of threats and opportunities in the environment may shape stereotype content, punishment strategies, and legal decision-making. Her work has been published in journals such as Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In this episode, we talk about stereotypes, criminal justice, and friendships. We discuss what stereotypes are, where they stem from, their different types, ecology-driven stereotypes, their connection to prejudice, and their social functions. We talk a bit about emotions from an evolutionary perspective, and how they apply to mediation contexts. We discuss how people develop perceptions of criminal behavior, and when and why they endorse the death penalty. Finally, we talk about friendships, who we want as friends, and friendship jealousy.
