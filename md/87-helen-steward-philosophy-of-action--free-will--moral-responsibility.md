Dr. Helen Steward is a Professor of Philosophy of Mind and Action at the University of Leeds, in the UK. Her research focusses on Philosophy of Action, Free Will, Philosophy of Mind and Metaphysics. In February 2015 she was awarded a Research Leadership Fellowship by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. She’s an associate editor for the journal Philosophical Explorations. And she’s also the author of the books The Ontology of Mind, and A Metaphysics for Freedom. 

In this episode, we talk about Philosophy of Action. What is the importance of understanding action and what causes action in studying agency and free will; action as downward causation; how to deal with other animals at a moral level; and the relationship between free will, determinism, moral responsibility, and social stability.
