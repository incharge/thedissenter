Dr. Catherine Molho is an Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at VU Amsterdam. Dr. Molho is a psychologist studying human cooperation, morality, and the role of emotions in decision-making. She draws upon insights from social and evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, and evolutionary biology to better understand the factors underlying cooperative and punitive decisions. In her work, she uses decision-making experiments, questionnaires, and intensive experience sampling methods.

In this episode, we talk about norms, moral emotions, and human cooperation. We start with norms, and their social functions. We talk about norm violations, and punishment. We get into the moral emotions of disgust and anger. We discuss how disgust sensitivity might link to opposition to immigration. We also talk about cooperation in contexts of hierarchy and power asymmetries, and Interdependence Theory and human cooperation.
