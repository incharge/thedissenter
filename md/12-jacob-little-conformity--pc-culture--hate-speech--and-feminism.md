Jacob Little is currently a PhD candidate in Creative Nonfiction at Ohio University, and obtained his MFA in Poetry at Minnesota State University. He is the Managing Editor of Brevity, and a co-founder and Consulting Editor of Profane. And he has written two wonderful pieces for Quillette, Rehabilitating Feminism, and Escaping Conformity, and that’s the reason why I invited him.  
Here, we talk about conformity; political correctness; hate speech; and modern-day feminism, including the #metoo movement.

You can check Jacob’s website, where he also has links for his literary works: https://www.jacoblittle.net/
