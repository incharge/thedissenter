RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2022.  
Dr. Robert Talisse is W. Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt University. His main area of research is political philosophy, with an emphasis on democratic theory and liberalism.

In this episode, we talk about pragmatism, democracy, and liberalism. We start by talking about what pragmatism is, and how it applies to political philosophy. We then discuss democracy, on what grounds it is justified, and the problems of pluralism and public ignorance. Finally, we talk about liberalism, and how it connects to democracy.
