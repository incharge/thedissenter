Dr. Rebecca Sear is a demographer and anthropologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), teaching demography and researching human reproductive behavior from an evolutionary perspective.

This is our second interview. You can watch the first one here: https://youtu.be/L7R-EKiYWNQ

In this episode, we start by talking about the study of human demography, and what we can learn from it. We discuss the myth of the nuclear family as the traditional family structure, child rearing in traditional societies, if children really need a parent from each sex at home, if father absence leads to poverty, and the negative effects of this myth on children and parents. We talk about how gendered division of labor develops in human societies. We discuss life history theory, and issues in how it has been applied to humans. We talk about the strengths of the evolutionary social sciences, and criticisms of the evolutionary social sciences, with a focus on evolutionary psychology. We discuss the ties between the study of human demography and the eugenics movement, and the recent academic resurgence of eugenics. Finally, we discuss issues with the national IQ datasets created by Richard Lynn, and ideas surrounding sex differences and representativeness in academia.
