RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 8th 2023.  
Dr. Adam Rutherford is Lecturer in Biology and Society at University College London’s Department of Genes, Evolution, and Environment, and President of Humanists UK. His interests are in evolution, genetics and developmental biology, and the history of biology. He has written extensively on Darwin, the development of evolutionary theory, the Modern Synthesis, early microscopy, synthetic biology and genetic engineering, behavioral ecology, gene-culture co-evolution, human evolution, and ancient DNA. He is the author of several books, including Control: The Dark History and Troubling Present of Eugenics.

In this episode, we focus on Control. We start by discussing what eugenics is, and how old it is as an ideology. We discuss if it makes sense to talk about “good” and “bad” traits in evolutionary biology, and the importance of genetic diversity. We talk about medical interventions. We get into eugenics in the early 20th century, and how widespread it was in the West. We talk about how some geneticists contributed to eugenics. We discuss the concept of “race”. We talk about behavior genetics, and group differences. We also get into eugenics in contemporary academia and politics, and talk about the “great replacement theory” conspiracy theory. Finally, we discuss if we should be worried about genetic engineering.
