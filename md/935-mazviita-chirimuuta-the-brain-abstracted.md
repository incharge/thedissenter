Dr. Mazviita Chirimuuta is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy in the School of Philosophy, Psychology & Language Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. She has focused on philosophical issues around vision, mind-brain and consciousness, and in the last few years she has mostly been writing about the problem of color, and how ideas from neuroscience can bring fresh light on the realism vs. anti-realism debate. She is the author of Outside Color: Perceptual Science and the Puzzle of Color in Philosophy, and The Brain Abstracted: Simplification in the History and Philosophy of Neuroscience.

In this episode, we focus on The Brain Abstracted. We talk about the thesis of the book, and the challenges of studying the brain. We discuss simplifying strategies in neuroscience, and why scientists seek simplicity. We talk about a pluralist approach to neuroscience. We explore the illustrative example of reflex theory. We discuss computational approaches, the limits of modeling, and representations. We compare computational-representational approaches to dynamical systems approaches to the motor cortex. We talk about machine learning approaches, whether AI can be conscious, and embodied cognition. Finally, we discuss the relation between philosophy and science.
