RECORDED ON JULY 11th, 2020.  
Dr. Manvir Singh just graduated with a PhD in human evolutionary biology from Harvard University, with a focus on cognitive and evolutionary anthropology. His research program aims to explain why societies develop complex, recurrent traditions such as shamanism, witchcraft, origin myths, property rights, sharing norms, lullabies, dance, music, and gods, as these have appeared in all types of societies across the globe, from nomadic hunter-gatherer bands to complex, industrial, mega-urbanized states.

In this episode, we start by talking about the Mentawai people from Indonesia, and the aspects of their sociality that Dr. Singh has focused his work the most on. One of those aspects refers to the fact that they have small, but moralizing, gods. Other topics include shamanism, witchcraft, sorcery, and religious self-denial. We also mention the role that self-interest plays in the design of social rules. Finally, we address the topic of music universals, the evolutionary bases of music, and infant-directed vocalizations.
