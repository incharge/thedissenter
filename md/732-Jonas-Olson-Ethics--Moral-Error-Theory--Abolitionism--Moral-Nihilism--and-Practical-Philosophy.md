Dr. Jonas Olson is Professor of Practical Philosophy at Stockholm University. His research areas include metaethics and related subjects.  

In this episode, we talk about metaethics, and practical philosophy. We start by distinguishing metaethics from normative ethics and applied ethics. We talk about the main questions and approaches in metaethics. We get specifically into moral error theory, moral abolitionism, and moral nihilism. We also discuss what moral facts are. We talk about moral certitude. Finally, we discuss what practical philosophy is, and how it relates to theoretical philosophy.
