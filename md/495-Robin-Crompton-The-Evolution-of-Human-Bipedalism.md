RECORDED ON APRIL 8th 2021.  
Dr. Robin Huw Crompton is professor of musculoskeletal biology at the University of Liverpool in the Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease. He has developed the Fossil Footprint Archive jointly with Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University.

In this episode, we talk about the evolution of human bipedality. We start by talking about the locomotion of our common ancestor with chimpanzees, and go through some of the main steps in the evolution of our musculoskeletal system. During the conversation, Dr. Crompton shows some fossils to the camera. We discuss if we can learn something about the evolution of our locomotion by studying the environments we evolved in, and also our diet. We talk about some of the hypotheses relating to the evolutionary pressures behind our bipedalism. Finally, we talk about modern musculoskeletal diseases.
