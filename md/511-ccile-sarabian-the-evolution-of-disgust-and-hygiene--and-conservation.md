RECORDED ON MAY 10th 2021.  
Dr. Cécile Sarabian is a Postdoctoral researcher in Cognitive Ecology at Kyoto University. She investigates parasite avoidance behaviors and their effectiveness in non-human primates and other animals via field and lab experimentation/observations. She is generally interested in the origins of hygiene and disgust in humans and in the potential applications of disgust into the field of Conservation.

In this episode, we talk about disgust and conservation. We start by discussing disgust from an evolutionary perspective. We talk about different disgust-related behaviors, and hygiene. We mention briefly how an evolutionary perspective can inform how people deal with the covid-19 pandemic, and how they react to pathogens in this context. We delve into the discussion surrounding the different domains of disgust (pathogen disgust, sexual disgust, and moral disgust). We also do a bit of comparative psychology, and explore to what extent we can compare non-human primates to us. We also talk about sex differences in disgust, and human universals in disgust reactions. Finally, we talk about new avenues to explore when it comes to the role disgust might play in animal conservation.
