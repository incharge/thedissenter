In this episode, we talk about elephant welfare, environmental pollutants, and zoonotic pathogens. We discuss elephant behavioral ecology, and their welfare in captivity. We talk about studying elephants across different settings; their physiology, and health biomarkers; behavioral assessment tools; and the goals of captive elephant management. Finally, we discuss the One Health approach to environmental pollutants and zoonotic pathogens.
