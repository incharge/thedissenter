Dr. Michael Bang Petersen is Professor of Political Science at Aarhus University, in Denmark. He also directs The Politics and Evolution Lab (PoNE Lab) there. He investigates how the adaptive challenges of human evolutionary history shape the way modern citizens think about mass politics. 

In this episode, we talk about evolutionary political psychology. We discuss what is to be understood as political behavior; the emotions, heuristics and biases that are more relevant to understand people’s political behavior (and also in other animals); the deservingness heuristic; the biological bases of our progress from small-scale hunter-gatherer societies to modern states, and the expansion of group identities; the cues that lead people to support the welfare system more easily; intentionality; how to tackle issues of political polarization; and also the benefits that politicians can take from learning more about evolutionary psychology, and how human psychology generally works.
