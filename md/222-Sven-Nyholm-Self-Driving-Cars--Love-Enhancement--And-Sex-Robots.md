excerpt: Dr. Sven Nyholm is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven
  University of Technology (TU/e). His main areas of research are applied ethics (especially
  the ethics of technology), ethical theory, and the history of ethics. More specifically,
  he has recently published on love-relationships and biomedical enhancements, sex
  robots, motivation-enhancements, accident-algorithms for self-driving cars, deep
  brain stimulation, happiness and well-being, meaning in life, and interpersonal
  respect and moral reasoning. His work also focuses on the ethics of automated driving,
  human-robot collaboration, deep brain stimulation (including its effect on the self),
  and disability and the goods of life. He is especially interested in how robotization
  and other types of automation affect traditional human values, as well as in existential
  questions raised by new technological developments.

Dr. Sven Nyholm is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). His main areas of research are applied ethics (especially the ethics of technology), ethical theory, and the history of ethics. More specifically, he has recently published on love-relationships and biomedical enhancements, sex robots, motivation-enhancements, accident-algorithms for self-driving cars, deep brain stimulation, happiness and well-being, meaning in life, and interpersonal respect and moral reasoning. His work also focuses on the ethics of automated driving, human-robot collaboration, deep brain stimulation (including its effect on the self), and disability and the goods of life. He is especially interested in how robotization and other types of automation affect traditional human values, as well as in existential questions raised by new technological developments.

In this episode, we talk about philosophy of technology. We go through some specific topics, like self-driving cars, love enhancement, and sex robots, and several different philosophical perspectives on them, and their ethical ramifications.
