RECORDED ON JUNE 2nd 2023.  
Dr. Lydia Moland is a Professor of Philosophy at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, where she teaches courses on moral philosophy, aesthetics, and the history of modern philosophy. For most of her career, she has written on nineteenth-century German philosophy. Recently, she turned her attention to her own country and to women. She discovered the work of American abolitionist Lydia Maria Child, on whom she wrote a book titled Lydia Maria Child: A Radical American Life (2022).

In this episode, we talk about 19th-century German philosophy, and abolitionism in the US. We discuss what characterizes German philosophy, particularly the topic of subjectivism. We get into Hegel’s philosophy, and his work on aesthetics and the arts, tragedy and comedy, and modern subjectivity in art. We talk about Hegel and Marx, and their views on capitalism, society, and poverty. We discuss how 19th-century philosophers took laughter seriously. Finally, we talk about abolitionism in the US, the work of Lydia Maria Child, and we discuss what we should make of politically motivated philosophy.
