In this episode, we talk about the origins of philosophy, and the Pre-Socratics. We first discuss what we should consider to be “philosophy” and where it might have started, and we also refer to the relationship between religion and philosophy. We then get into the Pre-Socratics, and what distinguished them from the others. We also talk about the sophists and the ancient poets, before ending with a discussion about the relationship between philosophy and (modern) science.
