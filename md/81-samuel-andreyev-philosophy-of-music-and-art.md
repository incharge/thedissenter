Samuel Andreyev is a Canadian music composer and writer residing in France. He also has a YouTube channel with his name.

Mr. Andreyev is a return guest on the show. Please go check out our first conversation, “Music Across Times and Cultures”: https://youtu.be/9UENs9ia6Zo

In this episode, we focus on philosophy of music, and go through how to properly evaluate a piece of music, by itself and in its performative aspects, and we also talk about the aesthetic purpose of music. Toward the end, we also discuss if artists can also have a saying on human nature. And we finish by talking a bit about modernist and postmodernist art, and if they really ruined the artistic enterprise.
