RECORDED ON FEBRUARY 15th 2024.  
Dr. Gordon Ingram is Senior Lecturer in Psychology at RMIT University Vietnam. His research centers on children’s and adolescents’ everyday communication online. He is the author of Adolescent Use of New Media and Internet Technologies: Debating Risks and Opportunities in the Digital Age.

In this episode, we focus on Adolescent Use of New Media and Internet Technologies. We start by talking about how to study the psychological impacts of the internet, the focus on adolescents, and moral panics surrounding new technologies and how scientists react to them. We then go through topics like self-concept and self-esteem; online identity; screen time; Instagram and body image; the link between social media and depression, and alternative hypotheses for the rising rates of depression; whether there is “internet addiction”; online social gaming; pornography and sexual life; privacy; educational opportunities; online dating; cyberbullying; intergroup and cross-cultural contacts; and how people interact online. We also discuss whether the risks associated with the internet are exaggerated, how we can enhance adolescents’ wellbeing, and the future of internet use.
