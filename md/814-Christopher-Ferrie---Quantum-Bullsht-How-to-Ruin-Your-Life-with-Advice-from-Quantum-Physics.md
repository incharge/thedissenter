RECORDED ON MARCH 28th 2023.  
Dr. Christopher Ferrie is an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney and Centre for Quantum Software and Information. His research interests include quantum estimation and control, and, in particular, the use of machine learning to solve statistical problems in quantum information science. He is the author of several books, the latest one being Quantum Bullsh*t: How to Ruin Your Life with Advice from Quantum Physics.

In this episode, we focus on Quantum Bullsh*t. We discuss what “quantum” means, how people misunderstand it, and how pseudoscientists and charlatans distort quantum physics. We go through several concepts and phenomena in quantum physics, including energy, quantum leap, waves and particles, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, superposition, and quantum entanglement. We discuss if quantum physics applies to human psychology, and if it can guide our lives. We also talk about time traveling, the multiverse, and quantum computers. Finally, we discuss if it is wise to tell people that they should be “doing their own research”, if we should “believe” in science, and if trying to debunk absurd claims is a waste of time.
