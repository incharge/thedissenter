RECORDED ON NOVEMBER 1st 2023.  
Dr. Christian Hart is a Professor of Psychology at Texas Woman’s University, where he is the Director of the Psychological Science program as well as the Director of the Human Deception Laboratory. His research explores the behavioral cues of deception, pathological lying, lying within relationships, lying and morality, and the factors that influence decisions to be honest or deceptive. He is the author of Pathological Lying: Theory, Research, and Practice, and Big Liars: What Psychological Science Tells Us About Lying and How You Can Avoid Being Duped.

In this episode, we focus on Big Liars. We start by discussing what counts as a lie, and how honest people are. We then talk about the psychological traits of “big liars”, the developmental psychology of lying and honesty, different types of liars, and sanctioned lies in certain occupations. We discuss lying in the context of romantic relationships, and in familial relationships and friendships. We talk about the strategies used by big liars, and how they avoid detection. We discuss the consequences of lying for the liars, people who relate to them, and society more generally. We talk about pathological lying, and how it can be treated. Finally, we talk about strategies to avoid being duped by liars.
