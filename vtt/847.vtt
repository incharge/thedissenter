00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.048
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.530
the Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.710
And today I'm joined by Doctor Lydia Moland. She's

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.108
a professor of Philosophy at Colby College in Waterville Maine

5
00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:16.280
in the US. She has written extensively on 19th

6
00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.789
century German philosophy. And more recently, she has

7
00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:23.388
also been interested in abolitionism in the US. And

8
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.019
she wrote a book titled Lydia Maria Child, a

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.490
Radical American Life based on the American evolutionist with the

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.310
same name. So, Doctor Moland, welcome to

11
00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.389
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.679
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be invited and

13
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.658
I'm looking forward to our conversation. OK. So

14
00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.509
, uh I would like to start by talking about

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.759
your work on 19th century German philosophy. So,

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.590
first of all, why did you get interested specifically

17
00:00:55.598 --> 00:01:00.109
in 19th century German philosophy? And do you think

18
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:04.620
that if anything, there's uh specific aspects of it

19
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.290
that make it distinct from other kinds of philosophy,

20
00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.888
from other places and other time periods? Yes.

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.870
Thank you for that. Um I got interested in

22
00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.579
German 19th century philosophy through Spinoza. So I took

23
00:01:21.588 --> 00:01:25.150
a very general philosophy course as an undergraduate. Uh

24
00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.588
and I had intended to be a political science major

25
00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.528
, but I read Spinoza and it just blew my

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.308
mind and I, I was so moved by the

27
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.948
vision that Spinoza had of holism and of um and

28
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.180
, and the way he argued that I decided to

29
00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.528
do more philosophy and ended up in a course that

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.028
ended with Kant. And I think as many people

31
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.528
do finished with some very deep dissatisfactions with Kant's dualism

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.730
and with his rationalism. And someone said to me

33
00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.808
, well, if you are impatient with Kant,

34
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.609
maybe you should try Hegel. Uh So the next

35
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.930
semester, I took a course on the Phenomenology of

36
00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.449
Spirit and then I was just hooked. Um and

37
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.078
I ended up going to Tubingen in Germany where Hegel

38
00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:14.368
himself studied, I lived there for a couple of

39
00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:20.437
years and really immersed myself in the culture of that

40
00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.457
particular time period. So many of your viewers will

41
00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:27.798
know that Tubing in is also where Holderlin lived and

42
00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:30.558
studied and also shelling. So Hagel was there in

43
00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:38.270
this incredibly fertile environment where people were taking very seriously

44
00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:42.479
. Spinoza was still essentially forbidden. He was still

45
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.469
considered too controversial and too heretical to take seriously.

46
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.860
But they were all sort of closet spin assists.

47
00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.899
And um I, I found all of that very

48
00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.278
intriguing. I think what, what really pulled me

49
00:02:55.288 --> 00:03:00.319
into Hagel was his attempt to make philosophical sense of

50
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.889
religion and of protestantism. In particularly I came from

51
00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:07.308
a protestant background and was really intrigued by his attempt

52
00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.699
to show what was important and vital about the protestant

53
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.699
worldview without attaching it to a kind of uh religious

54
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.819
literalism. Um So that was, that was very

55
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.889
helpful to me, even just in thinking through my

56
00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.110
own philosophical questions. So as far as what makes

57
00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:31.750
that period distinct, um a couple of things come

58
00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:35.149
to mind, again, sort of connected to Spinoza

59
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.729
. I think the, again, this idea of

60
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.649
holism, the attempt not to think of philosophy as

61
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.258
just addressing one problem or focusing on just epistemology or

62
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.990
just in the physics. But the idea that an

63
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.129
idea could possibly explain kind of everything. Um I

64
00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.360
think characterizes a lot of early 19th century philosophy in

65
00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:04.788
Germany, certainly not later. But sometimes when I

66
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.000
teach students this, I find that, that,

67
00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:11.788
that claim is really strange to them that there could

68
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.919
be one answer or one idea that could explain everything

69
00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.488
. But I sometimes push back on that and say

70
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.129
, wouldn't it be even stranger if different parts of

71
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.389
the reality or of philosophy were totally unconnected from each

72
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.790
other? I wouldn't it be sort of strange if

73
00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:34.709
nature functions in a completely different way from art or

74
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.399
from politics or from epistemology? So, isn't there

75
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.730
something even just more intellectually consistent about looking for an

76
00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:49.600
idea that could explain most of human experience and maybe

77
00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:55.160
even nonhuman experience? So that's one another, I

78
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.220
think a lot of really existential questions get started in

79
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.730
the 19th century. So you see that some in

80
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.759
Kant for sure. But I think it took this

81
00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.040
generation of thinkers who grew up in the French revolution

82
00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:15.329
, which meant that everything they thought they knew about

83
00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:19.319
the way politics could and should work were um was

84
00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.608
, was challenged. And then there were great hopes

85
00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.600
around the French revolution and then they were dashed.

86
00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:28.889
And so this was a generation that really grew up

87
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.798
feeling the existential weight of a major historical disappointment if

88
00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:38.358
you were a young person in that generation. Um

89
00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:40.548
And, and so the combination I think of K

90
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.738
turn towards the subject, which really gives an individual

91
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.379
subject an enormous amount of power. And therefore,

92
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.798
also responsibility opens up these big existential questions and then

93
00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.459
living in this part of history where there are enormous

94
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.278
shifts um that ask questions like what is the role

95
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.449
of politics and what is the role of the individual

96
00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:10.199
in politics? And how do individuals assert themselves in

97
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:14.069
the face of great historical forces? Um Those set

98
00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:16.869
the stage for the kinds of grappling with, what

99
00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.709
does it mean to be an individual? What does

100
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.250
it mean to be alienated in a society? Um

101
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.709
Obviously something that's been picked up by Marx and then

102
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.709
more by Kirkegaard and Nietzsche later in the century.

103
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.149
Um And then I would also say, and,

104
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.899
and this is clearly in part because of my own

105
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:39.920
work, a real reorientation around art and around aesthetic

106
00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:43.108
experience. So that certainly gets started in Kant with

107
00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.519
his taking seriously aesthetic experience is one of the most

108
00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:49.319
important things about human experience. Um But then when

109
00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.689
you get to people like Hegel, but also very

110
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.704
much his contemporaries like Lael or Novalis, Bettina von

111
00:06:56.713 --> 00:06:59.504
Ar Carlina Von Gunder Rode. Um some of these

112
00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:02.403
other people who saw in art and then also in

113
00:07:02.415 --> 00:07:09.045
nature and our aesthetic responses to nature, really central

114
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.744
truths about the human condition. Then I, I

115
00:07:11.754 --> 00:07:14.334
think you get something very interesting that lasts throughout the

116
00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:16.244
century in part because I think one way I try

117
00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:19.980
to think about it is the question, what if

118
00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:27.119
art far from being derivative or entertaining or the thing

119
00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:30.220
that we can philosophize about kind of if we get

120
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.100
to it? What if instead it is the thing

121
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.149
, the thing that that can explain us to ourselves

122
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.410
and the world to ourselves better than other branches of

123
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.028
philosophy. If that's true, then a lot of

124
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.678
things need to be revolved um sort in any kind

125
00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:51.790
of revolution so that I'll stop there. But those

126
00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:54.588
are a couple of the things that I find really

127
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.798
compelling and possibly um I don't know, unique but

128
00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:01.309
certainly indicative of that period in that place in the

129
00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.259
world. OK. So I have to tell you

130
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:07.238
straight away that the three German philosophers whose work I'm

131
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:13.480
most familiar with are Kent Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. So

132
00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:16.309
uh probably because of some of my personality traits.

133
00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.699
I don't know exactly why, but those are the

134
00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:22.519
three I felt most compelled about. And, uh

135
00:08:22.528 --> 00:08:26.358
, I mean, but, uh, of course

136
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:30.567
, I guess that we could pretty much say that

137
00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.356
, uh, everyone in the 19th century in German

138
00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:39.256
was to some extent influenced by Kent. Right?

139
00:08:39.408 --> 00:08:41.677
I mean, even the ones who rejected most of

140
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:45.807
his philosophy or some, or parts of his philosophy

141
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.768
, like for example, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, Nietzsche

142
00:08:48.947 --> 00:08:52.138
, to a greater extent, even them were very

143
00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:54.775
, very much influenced by Kent. I, I

144
00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:58.085
think we could and of course, uh I mean

145
00:08:58.096 --> 00:09:01.764
, it's not that German philosophy in the 19th centuries

146
00:09:01.894 --> 00:09:05.875
is a monolith, like for example, sometimes people

147
00:09:05.884 --> 00:09:09.676
talk about German idealism, but I mean, you

148
00:09:09.684 --> 00:09:13.796
get into figures like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and they were

149
00:09:13.806 --> 00:09:20.313
extremely different from can or what you would consider just

150
00:09:20.484 --> 00:09:26.734
general idealism. Nietzsche particularly sometimes is classified as a

151
00:09:26.864 --> 00:09:35.092
romantic or rationalist and he certainly rejected many aspects of

152
00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:39.273
Kent's philosophy. And Schopenhauer was very much a pessimist

153
00:09:39.283 --> 00:09:43.092
for example. So, uh but I mean,

154
00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:46.291
do you think that we could look uh even with

155
00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:48.711
those differences? And of course, we could talk

156
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:54.291
about the other philosophers and they certainly have m many

157
00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:58.421
distinct things about their philosophical corpus, I think.

158
00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:01.432
But uh do you think that e even with all

159
00:10:01.442 --> 00:10:07.121
of those differences and existentialism also that I didn't mention

160
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.489
and all of that, that we can still find

161
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:16.928
recurrent themes in 19th century German philosophy. Yeah,

162
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.288
I mean, I, I think one really is

163
00:10:20.298 --> 00:10:24.229
the struggle with the nature of subjectivity and what it

164
00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:30.639
means. Epistemological, metaphysically, politically, aesthetically.

165
00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:33.320
Uh What does it mean to be a self?

166
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.658
And like if you think not to oversimplify, but

167
00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:39.678
if you think about someone like Descartes just saying,

168
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.609
well, the self is a thinking thing. It's

169
00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:45.440
essentially an immaterial substance. Um its essence is just

170
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.009
to think and it subsists as a thinking thing.

171
00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:52.788
Um You know, a quick contrast to Kant,

172
00:10:52.798 --> 00:10:56.759
I think is Kant's idea of this self as an

173
00:10:56.769 --> 00:11:01.279
activity. So as something that is actively synthesizing whatever

174
00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:05.139
is coming at it and that it only achieves selfhood

175
00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:11.178
through being active. And I think in a way

176
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.259
, one of the questions that survives all the way

177
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:16.759
through the century then is um what kind of activity

178
00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:20.759
is that? And what does the basis of thinking

179
00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:26.798
through subjectivity? Um mean for objectivity and for reality

180
00:11:26.808 --> 00:11:31.859
and for how we treat other people and obviously paired

181
00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:33.700
with that is the question of whether there is a

182
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:39.090
transcendent divine that humans are beholden to or created by

183
00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:43.729
and who dictates reality as we see it. And

184
00:11:43.739 --> 00:11:48.058
in my opinion, Hagel, for instance, is

185
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.239
trying very hard to reorient us from that to seeing

186
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.538
that humans are the only creators of meaning and that

187
00:11:56.548 --> 00:12:01.460
we only create meaning in cooper operation with each other

188
00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:03.739
. So there's, if you think about kind as

189
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.729
primarily thinking of the subject as activity. Hagel,

190
00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:09.009
I think picks that up but with a much stronger

191
00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:15.259
emphasis on the kind of mutual recognition that's necessary to

192
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:18.788
think about my being a subject is dependent on your

193
00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:22.210
recognizing me as a subject. And only when we

194
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:26.058
recognize each other, not just abs as abstract subjects

195
00:12:26.469 --> 00:12:30.710
, but as subjects embodied in different roles and different

196
00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:33.250
areas of history, different life plans. Can we

197
00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:37.950
really treat each other with the dignity and respect that

198
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.808
Kant had originally said we owed each other. And

199
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.619
so I think like if you follow that trajectory out

200
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:46.658
um and start to think about like Kirke guards grappling

201
00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:52.019
with what it meant to be a subject kind of

202
00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:58.960
at odds with um with the conventional world or norms

203
00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:01.678
that were established by a society that he didn't feel

204
00:13:01.109 --> 00:13:05.538
um acknowledged by. And then someone like Nietzsche,

205
00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:11.149
who I think is even more expressly celebrating the agony

206
00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:16.298
and the ecstasy of being a self creating subject.

207
00:13:16.308 --> 00:13:16.869
So I think in, in Nietzsche much more than

208
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:22.418
in Hegel, you get again the existential. Yeah

209
00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:24.259
, I'll say it again, agony and ecstasy of

210
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:28.090
the fact that we have to create our own meaning

211
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:33.908
where we can't rely on the divine or on nature

212
00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:37.710
as something separate from us to tell us what is

213
00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:39.139
meaningful, we have to do it ourselves. And

214
00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:43.519
that um is a great privilege and honor, but

215
00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:48.269
also an enormous responsibility that I think in Nietzsche's view

216
00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.048
more than in Hagel's only some people are really up

217
00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:54.288
to shouldering. So in, in each of them

218
00:13:54.298 --> 00:13:54.849
, you get the sense that lots of people would

219
00:13:54.859 --> 00:14:00.048
just really rather prefer to have others tell them what

220
00:14:00.058 --> 00:14:03.048
is meaningful. Um And our calling is to resist

221
00:14:03.058 --> 00:14:05.308
that. I think Hagel, for instance, is

222
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.690
much less interested in that kind of resistance and more

223
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.190
interested in trying to think of ourselves as a cooperating

224
00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.158
group of people, each with our own subjectivities.

225
00:14:16.298 --> 00:14:20.570
But working out our subjectivity and our bid for freedom

226
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.889
very much with each other as opposed to in the

227
00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:26.609
kind of individualistic way that you get with Nietzsche.

228
00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:31.509
That subjectivity part. I mean, what I'm going

229
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:33.519
to say now, if I say something that you

230
00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:37.119
don't agree with or you think is incorrect, please

231
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:39.340
correct me. But uh I mean, of course

232
00:14:39.349 --> 00:14:43.989
, in someone like Nietzsche and is to some extent

233
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.710
, perspect perspective is philosophy because he, he particularly

234
00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:52.509
in beyond good and evil, for example. And

235
00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:56.769
when and when it comes to morality more specifically,

236
00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:00.928
there, there are places in his work where he

237
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:07.129
expresses a very uh perspective perspective on, on things

238
00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:11.940
uh uh and things seem to be very dependent on

239
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.080
the subject and subjectivity. But uh I mean,

240
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.279
uh don't you think that even in Kent, particularly

241
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:26.190
when uh in the critic of purism, he talks

242
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.538
about, for example, the limits of, of

243
00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:35.590
our uh o of the information we can get from

244
00:15:35.678 --> 00:15:39.710
our senses, the uh th those kinds of limits

245
00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:45.168
and, and also the fact that we uh sort

246
00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:48.678
of uh have some sort of categories of understanding.

247
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.950
And I think that some of them, they,

248
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.719
it takes from, I guess Aristotle, if I'm

249
00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:56.548
not mistaken and expands on them, I mean,

250
00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:00.359
the a and then the, and then also when

251
00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:03.009
he gets into the, the antinomy and he talks

252
00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:08.609
about the things that even as through a reasoning process

253
00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:12.509
cannot fully answer. Like for example, if there's

254
00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:15.849
life after death, if there's a God, if

255
00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:18.639
the universe is infinite in time and space questions like

256
00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:22.369
that. Uh I, I mean, that isn't

257
00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:27.099
there, even if only a tiny seed of subjectivity

258
00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:30.408
planted there because I mean, it seems that there's

259
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:37.798
the thing in itself or whatever reality is and then

260
00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:41.080
our own limitations as human subjects when it comes to

261
00:16:41.359 --> 00:16:49.048
perceiving it and getting an objective understanding of what it

262
00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:51.418
is. I, I mean, I, I

263
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:52.859
don't know, what are your thoughts on this?

264
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.750
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's 100% right?

265
00:16:56.759 --> 00:17:03.359
And I think that's a kind of radical postulate that

266
00:17:03.369 --> 00:17:07.549
I don't even think Kant felt the existential weight of

267
00:17:08.009 --> 00:17:11.229
which is to say it took someone. Well,

268
00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:14.250
I, I, I'm much more familiar with the

269
00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:15.529
early romantics, you know, the Schlegel and,

270
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.309
and Schelling and, and Novalis and Gunter Rode and

271
00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:23.088
people like that who took that. I, I

272
00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:26.529
just feel like much more to heart and as you

273
00:17:26.539 --> 00:17:30.088
say, I think it is partly dispositional or generational

274
00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:32.489
that, you know, can have laid those things

275
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.180
out fairly matter of factly. But I think that

276
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.769
the consequences for how we think about our role in

277
00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:41.269
, on our responsibility in the world and the radical

278
00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:45.939
perspect nature of that, as you say, um

279
00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:51.500
was really exhilarating and upsetting to more to the next

280
00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:57.439
generation of thinkers. So getting into Hegel and specifically

281
00:17:57.449 --> 00:18:00.299
, of course, you've already said a few things

282
00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:03.900
about him, but getting specifically to into aesthetics because

283
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.729
when we think about Hegel, I mean, people

284
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.549
who are not philosophers and not specifically very familiar with

285
00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:17.219
Hegel's philosophy, we tend to just think about his

286
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:23.689
more systematic and abstract approaches to history and uh uh

287
00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:29.818
thesis, antithesis synthesis and stuff like that. But

288
00:18:29.828 --> 00:18:34.039
he also in fact wrote about aesthetics. Yes.

289
00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:37.009
And that was part of his system for sure.

290
00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:41.549
So um aesthetics is the first part of absolute spirit

291
00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:42.809
. So if you think of, of, you

292
00:18:42.818 --> 00:18:47.039
know, the system writ large, you've got um

293
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:48.150
you know, subjective spirit and the first you have

294
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.009
logic and then you have philosophy of nature and then

295
00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:55.309
in philosophy of spirit, you first have subjective spirit

296
00:18:55.318 --> 00:18:59.029
and then objective spirit and then absolute spirit. Absolute

297
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.289
spirit is where Hagel talks about the three ways that

298
00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:07.338
he thinks humans grapple with what it means to be

299
00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:10.848
human. So the ways in which we reflect on

300
00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:14.729
um on the world, but also on our role

301
00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:15.289
in the world. So the first of those is

302
00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:19.309
art and then religion and then being a philosopher,

303
00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:22.789
Hagel always has philosophy win at the end. So

304
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:27.939
philosophy for Hagel is still the best um most complete

305
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:33.059
and most explicit way that humans reckon with their um

306
00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:36.709
their own status and ask themselves about meaning in the

307
00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:38.900
world. But art has a really important place in

308
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:44.750
that for Hagel because we are embodied sensual beings.

309
00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:47.309
And contrary to what some people think about Hagel,

310
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.259
he doesn't regret that. I mean, it isn't

311
00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:53.170
that if we could, we should get rid of

312
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.509
that part of ourselves. I think he thinks that

313
00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:00.529
that's a very rich and very vital way in which

314
00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:03.318
humans remain part of the natural world. So we

315
00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:07.828
continue to feel and smell and hear things um that

316
00:20:07.838 --> 00:20:11.348
are outside of us. But we also use our

317
00:20:11.358 --> 00:20:15.660
senses to create things that then mean something to us

318
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:19.318
and that reflect our own grappling with that meaning.

319
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.900
So I think that for Hegel, aesthetics is the

320
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:30.259
sensuous way of experiencing truth. So truth for Hegel

321
00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:33.838
again, back to Spinoza is this very holistic view

322
00:20:33.848 --> 00:20:38.529
of the identity of identity and difference. So he

323
00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:41.130
says the true is the whole, it's the thing

324
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.539
that brings together contraries and this is where people get

325
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:49.130
the thesis sis synthesis um theme that you just referred

326
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:55.180
to. And so art is the way that we

327
00:20:55.189 --> 00:21:00.650
can sense that truth through our senses as opposed to

328
00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:03.368
understanding it through narratives, which is the way Hegel

329
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.838
characterizes religion. So interestingly, religion for him is

330
00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:11.078
primarily about narrative stories that we tell ourselves to explain

331
00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:15.219
everything from the origin of the world to um you

332
00:21:15.229 --> 00:21:18.039
know, our own relationship to each other through.

333
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:21.640
And then philosophy is supposed to do that without narrative

334
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.969
and without our senses. So just through thought.

335
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:29.259
So then within aesthetics, Hagel's project is to say

336
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.559
how art does that and which kinds of art and

337
00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:37.689
which particular instances of art do that best? So

338
00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:40.529
for him, the question always is, is this

339
00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:44.449
particular art form or this particular artwork allowing us to

340
00:21:44.459 --> 00:21:48.059
sense the idea which is the unity of unity and

341
00:21:48.068 --> 00:21:51.689
division or the true? That is the whole.

342
00:21:52.199 --> 00:21:55.098
So he does this um in a couple of ways

343
00:21:55.108 --> 00:21:57.150
. Um One by giving what some people call the

344
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.539
first really philosophical history of art. I always think

345
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:04.920
people are too quick to assign first to anything and

346
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.420
usually when they do that, it's to a male

347
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.789
European philosopher. And I think that is often not

348
00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:14.719
true. So I try to be skeptical about that

349
00:22:14.858 --> 00:22:15.779
. Um but whether he was first or not,

350
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:19.729
he certainly had a very influential idea of the sort

351
00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:22.430
of history and progress of art. So that's in

352
00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:26.068
what's part two of his lectures on the philosophy of

353
00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:29.979
art. And then he has a whole part three

354
00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:30.670
and I'm happy to get into it. This is

355
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.088
one of my major claims in my book on Hagel's

356
00:22:34.098 --> 00:22:37.660
aesthetics is that part three has been essentially neglected by

357
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.400
HGL scholars. But that's where he talks about what

358
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.150
he calls individual arts, which are architecture, sculpture

359
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.088
, painting, music, and poetry. Importantly,

360
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.328
in that order, because that's the order in which

361
00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:56.338
Hagel thinks he can explain how humans increasingly come to

362
00:22:56.348 --> 00:23:00.400
take ownership of their own um art. So I'm

363
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.598
happy to talk about that later. But anyway,

364
00:23:02.608 --> 00:23:07.318
so that's that in general um is where aesthetics and

365
00:23:07.328 --> 00:23:10.930
the philosophy of art fits in Hegel's system. And

366
00:23:10.939 --> 00:23:11.989
the, the other big claim that I make in

367
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.029
my book on Hagel's aesthetics is that we learn so

368
00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:21.150
much about Hagel's idealism through his aesthetics. So it's

369
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.848
not just that OK, we get Hagel's system and

370
00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:26.390
then when we have time, we can do the

371
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.969
aesthetics. But if we don't understand the aesthetics,

372
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.689
we don't understand really crucial things about Hagel's theory of

373
00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:37.059
selfhood, about feeling about perception, like things that

374
00:23:37.068 --> 00:23:40.160
, that people usually talk about under the heading of

375
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.769
, you know, metaphysics or epistemology. Um But

376
00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:44.588
I think there's a lot to learn about those more

377
00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:47.459
traditional fields. Um Well, see, I shouldn't

378
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:49.459
even say traditional fields because that, that wasn't the

379
00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:53.170
case in Hegel's generation that people thought that metaphysics and

380
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:59.039
epistemology were like the core philosophical um enterprises and aesthetics

381
00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:02.578
was just derivative really the opposite. Um So it's

382
00:24:02.588 --> 00:24:04.078
more because of the way philosophy developed, especially in

383
00:24:04.088 --> 00:24:07.059
the early 20th century that we've come to think that

384
00:24:07.068 --> 00:24:10.430
um again, so part of what I'm, what

385
00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:11.608
I try to do here is, is, is

386
00:24:11.618 --> 00:24:14.539
reorient us towards thinking about it the other way.

387
00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:17.650
So there's something that you mentioned there that I would

388
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.009
like to get more into. So, and,

389
00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:22.219
and please correct me if I'm wrong. But it

390
00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:26.759
seems then that in a way uh the way Hegel

391
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:30.338
approaches aesthetics, I mean, it's not as some

392
00:24:30.348 --> 00:24:36.689
sort of a separate field or domain from all the

393
00:24:36.699 --> 00:24:41.660
other domains of philosophy, like epistemology, probably ethics

394
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.338
and metaphysics because uh I mean, isn't it also

395
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.059
that as Hegel uh understands art and aesthetics more generally

396
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:56.539
, that it ties very much to epistemology for example

397
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:59.910
, and how we understand the world and how we

398
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.750
acquire knowledge about it. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely

399
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.868
. So we don't, there are things that we

400
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.969
can only sort of know through our senses. So

401
00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:12.750
that's an epistemological question. And there are ways in

402
00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:19.630
which our status as embodied beings can only be known

403
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.509
to us through our senses. And so if we

404
00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:27.009
don't talk about art, we're not talking about a

405
00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:30.019
key part of epistemology. And I think that Hagel

406
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:33.868
has a pretty clear sense that our senses are,

407
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.838
uh again, it's not, sometimes people think that

408
00:25:37.848 --> 00:25:40.650
Hagel thinks that we'd be best if we were disembodied

409
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.328
and I just think that's absolutely false. Um So

410
00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:45.818
, in so far as part of what we know

411
00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:48.598
is embodied and there is such a thing as embodied

412
00:25:48.608 --> 00:25:51.039
knowledge, this is where we get it, we

413
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.779
get it through aesthetics. And I should say,

414
00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:56.338
you know, strangely, especially coming after Kant and

415
00:25:56.348 --> 00:26:00.680
Shelling Hegel is completely uninterested in natural beauty. Like

416
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:03.989
he just doesn't even really want to talk about it

417
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:07.059
. Um He, he is almost exclusively interested in

418
00:26:07.068 --> 00:26:11.779
the philosophy of art and in aesthetics as an artistic

419
00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:15.598
phenomenon. Um But other people have certainly talked a

420
00:26:15.608 --> 00:26:18.650
lot more about our aesthetic appreciation of nature. And

421
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.338
Schiller is a great example of that. And it's

422
00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:23.318
always been very surprising to me that Hagel doesn't engage

423
00:26:23.328 --> 00:26:26.689
with that conversation in Schiller more than he does.

424
00:26:26.199 --> 00:26:29.818
Um But yes, absolutely. Um So like to

425
00:26:29.828 --> 00:26:32.529
give you an example when he talks about music,

426
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.098
music for Hegel is the way we sense time.

427
00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:41.459
And if you think about Kant, talking about time

428
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:45.250
is one of the two oper intuitions through which that

429
00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:48.489
is necessary to our understanding the world and having experience

430
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.318
at all. For Hegel. Music is the thing

431
00:26:52.328 --> 00:26:56.000
that in the, in the most pure sense allows

432
00:26:56.009 --> 00:27:03.059
us to sense time and since time is so critical

433
00:27:03.068 --> 00:27:06.949
to selfhood, so there's no selfhood without time in

434
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.789
a way. He thinks that music allows us to

435
00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:11.368
sense the self. I mean, it doesn't get

436
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:18.009
more root epistemological and metaphysical than that. So what

437
00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:21.269
, what music allows us to do is have this

438
00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:26.750
very pure sense of what is so purely part of

439
00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:30.098
our existence, namely time. And that Hagel thinks

440
00:27:30.108 --> 00:27:36.209
is why music literally moves us, I mean,

441
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.890
literally and metaphorically. So you can be moved by

442
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.900
music emotionally. But Hagel himself says that sometimes without

443
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.500
knowing it, we'll start tapping our feet when or

444
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:48.969
moving our body. I love that image of Hagel

445
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:49.930
it like, you know, we tended to give

446
00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:52.699
him as such a serious German philosopher and he was

447
00:27:52.709 --> 00:27:56.608
. But um but he himself recognizing that sometimes he

448
00:27:56.618 --> 00:27:57.848
couldn't help but move, you know, that that's

449
00:27:57.858 --> 00:28:02.838
really uh deep, deep knowledge of ourselves. And

450
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.789
again, the knowledge without which I think Hagel thinks

451
00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:08.848
our own understanding of ourselves would be impoverished. That's

452
00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:11.029
all very interesting. I mean, oo one of

453
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:15.549
the things that I find fascinating about some philosophers is

454
00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:21.348
that nowadays through science, we are confirming some of

455
00:28:21.358 --> 00:28:23.660
their ideas or intuitions, things that they've arrived at

456
00:28:23.939 --> 00:28:27.719
uh without uh II, I mean, not through

457
00:28:27.729 --> 00:28:32.358
science as at least as we understand it today,

458
00:28:32.368 --> 00:28:34.130
of course. But for example, when you were

459
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:40.088
talking there about uh embodiment and embodied knowledge, I

460
00:28:40.098 --> 00:28:42.000
mean, nowadays, we have an entire field of

461
00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:48.953
embodied cognition and how we acquire knowledge through, not

462
00:28:48.963 --> 00:28:52.884
just through operations that occur in our brain, but

463
00:28:52.894 --> 00:28:55.775
through our brain being connected to the rest of our

464
00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:57.713
body and how we move in the world and the

465
00:28:57.723 --> 00:29:02.324
actions we do and how we interact with things.

466
00:29:02.334 --> 00:29:03.930
And I, I mean, it's really fascinating to

467
00:29:03.939 --> 00:29:06.949
me and uh I mean, as I said,

468
00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:10.529
I'm more familiar with people like Nietzsche, but even

469
00:29:10.588 --> 00:29:12.630
Nietzsche, we could say was very much a philosopher

470
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.670
of action. I mean, he, he loved

471
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:21.150
to walk a lot and thinking while he was walking

472
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.078
and he talked about doing philosopher, philosophy with a

473
00:29:25.088 --> 00:29:30.680
hammer and, and they very much admire people of

474
00:29:30.689 --> 00:29:33.469
action. And I, I mean, doing things

475
00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:37.489
instead of just sitting and thinking and have this sort

476
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.959
of more platonic vision of things that perhaps we could

477
00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:47.338
or should in a way try to disembody ourselves,

478
00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:49.858
which in a way seems very, uh, uh

479
00:29:49.868 --> 00:29:52.519
, II, I mean, uh, the,

480
00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:53.799
there's a very interesting caricature of that. I,

481
00:29:53.809 --> 00:29:56.259
I don't know if you ever watched the movie,

482
00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.049
The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen. But there's a,

483
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:07.019
there's a scene there played by Robin Williams where he's

484
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:08.420
, uh, uh, the king of the moon

485
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.729
. I think it's the king of the moon,

486
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:14.549
but the man on the moon and he can separate

487
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:17.489
his head from the rest of the body just to

488
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.779
try to become more enlightened and it doesn't really work

489
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:25.838
. So I think it's a very, uh,

490
00:30:25.848 --> 00:30:29.979
a very funny parody of that sort of, uh

491
00:30:29.989 --> 00:30:36.338
disembodied idea of nationality or epistemology. So, yeah

492
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.189
. Yeah. And I do think that Hagel,

493
00:30:37.199 --> 00:30:42.019
despite his reputation, also resisted that kind of reification

494
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:45.219
of reason and of the mind. Um, and

495
00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:47.358
, you know, there's a lot of that in

496
00:30:47.368 --> 00:30:49.430
his philosophy of subjective spirit too when he talks about

497
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:55.400
anthropology and um in psychology and ways in which our

498
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.559
minds are very formed by what happens around us.

499
00:30:57.568 --> 00:31:00.489
And it talks about insanity in those passages as being

500
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.130
very much tied to our embodied um existence. So

501
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.328
there's, there's way more of that in HGL than

502
00:31:07.338 --> 00:31:08.318
most people think. And again, I think the

503
00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:11.358
aesthetics are a wonderful way to get at that.

504
00:31:11.368 --> 00:31:12.739
I mean, I'll, I'll say one other thing

505
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.769
about it. I think part of what Hagel really

506
00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:21.140
appreciated about art is that we go through our everyday

507
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.539
lives, sensing things, but not being aware that

508
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:27.680
we're sensing them. So not being aware of ourselves

509
00:31:27.689 --> 00:31:33.489
as seeing and as hearing and as touching. And

510
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.000
when we do that, I think Hagel thinks we

511
00:31:36.009 --> 00:31:38.519
risk beginning to treat the world as something that's just

512
00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:41.640
out there that's a given. You know, so

513
00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:45.299
mcdowell and Brandon have been talking about this for a

514
00:31:45.309 --> 00:31:47.269
very long time. Mcdowell, especially the myth of

515
00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.789
the given, right? So the world is out

516
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:49.959
there and what epistemology is, is just our,

517
00:31:49.969 --> 00:31:56.189
like attaching our ideas to the outside world in uh

518
00:31:56.209 --> 00:31:59.818
in an accurate way. And I think Hagel thinks

519
00:31:59.828 --> 00:32:01.568
that that that happens in part just out of habit

520
00:32:01.578 --> 00:32:04.969
, of course. So when I walk by a

521
00:32:04.979 --> 00:32:07.059
tree, I can't every time think, wow,

522
00:32:07.068 --> 00:32:09.299
I'm seeing a tree. And even though, you

523
00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:12.088
know, it seems this way from this perspective,

524
00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:13.848
it's actually a different way from that. Like I'd

525
00:32:13.858 --> 00:32:16.890
never get through my day. Um But what art

526
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:22.608
does is remind us of what our senses are doing

527
00:32:22.618 --> 00:32:25.890
by disrupting that in really interesting ways. So,

528
00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:30.868
and one example would be looking at a painting and

529
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.259
realizing that I can see three dimensions where there aren't

530
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.068
three dimensions. And that tells me something about the

531
00:32:37.078 --> 00:32:40.910
interaction of my mind with the world. So we

532
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.729
might think of a painting is a paradigmatic example of

533
00:32:44.739 --> 00:32:47.838
something that just exists independently outside of us. But

534
00:32:47.848 --> 00:32:52.588
actually for it to exist as a painting, there

535
00:32:52.598 --> 00:32:54.630
has to be someone looking at it and perceiving it

536
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.029
in a certain way. And Hagel thinks that that

537
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:01.568
kind of mutual formation between the self and the world

538
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.479
actually is what is true of us all day,

539
00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:07.068
every day. But we get used to it,

540
00:33:07.078 --> 00:33:09.410
it becomes and this is a really important technical term

541
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.650
for him. Prosaic, right? We start to

542
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.068
treat it as just sort of normal and given and

543
00:33:17.439 --> 00:33:21.529
, and, and as existing independently of us.

544
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.140
And what art reminds us is that in fact,

545
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.930
everything that we sense and everything that we do is

546
00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:30.439
part of our mutual engagement and formation with the world

547
00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:35.939
. And I think Hegel famously doesn't articulate a theory

548
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:38.660
of aesthetic experience the way Khan does. So,

549
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.219
Kant says, you know, it's the playing of

550
00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:43.578
the faculties and that's part of why it gives us

551
00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.848
pleasure is because it gives us a break from our

552
00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:47.979
kind of prosaic parsing of the world Hagel doesn't ever

553
00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:52.598
actually say that. But I think what he implies

554
00:33:52.608 --> 00:33:58.130
is that when we are disrupted, out of our

555
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.519
prosaic attitude towards the world into a more aesthetic attitude

556
00:34:01.529 --> 00:34:05.930
towards it, we're actually sensing truth in a way

557
00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:08.289
that we don't otherwise. So if I go from

558
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.139
just seeing the tree to having an aesthetic experience of

559
00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:15.500
the tree, that's actually a more true experience of

560
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.099
the tree. And that's part of what gives me

561
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.000
joy. So I think that's part of what Hagel

562
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.860
thinks is going on in all kinds of aesthetic pleasure

563
00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.478
. So uh there was a point there uh in

564
00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:34.148
my previous question where you mentioned the fact that at

565
00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.349
a certain point in his work on aesthetics, Hegel

566
00:34:37.438 --> 00:34:42.340
talks about how humans can take ownership of their art

567
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:45.719
through specific kinds of art. Could you tell us

568
00:34:45.728 --> 00:34:49.199
a little bit more about that? Yeah. So

569
00:34:49.208 --> 00:34:54.559
this is behind his trajectory from architecture to sculpture to

570
00:34:54.568 --> 00:34:58.289
what he calls or actually it's one of his um

571
00:34:58.298 --> 00:35:00.918
editors. But anyway, the three romantic arts which

572
00:35:00.927 --> 00:35:06.217
are painting music and poetry. So, and many

573
00:35:06.228 --> 00:35:09.048
other philosophers like Herder had put art into a different

574
00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:13.197
trajectory. So I think one really good way of

575
00:35:13.309 --> 00:35:15.197
trying to figure out what Hagel is up to is

576
00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:16.818
to compare those and and you know, why does

577
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:21.269
he put what at the top? Um So for

578
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:28.269
Hegel architecture is the art form that feels most externalized

579
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.398
to humans, right? So it's big in scope

580
00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:34.260
. It's also usually functional, although he often,

581
00:35:34.269 --> 00:35:37.478
he also talks about architecture that's not functional. Um

582
00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:39.878
And it, it has to do primarily with matter

583
00:35:40.289 --> 00:35:45.289
that seems independent of humans. So stone or brick

584
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:52.128
or wood and then sculpture also has a more um

585
00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:54.829
and an externalized material. So whether that's marble or

586
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.688
plaster or whatever, but in sculpture, at least

587
00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.869
paradigmatic sculpture as Hagel understands it, humans start to

588
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.949
reflect themselves in it. So paradigmatic sculpture for Hegel

589
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:14.780
is ancient Greek sculpture where um humans are no longer

590
00:36:14.789 --> 00:36:21.769
making uh like monstrous, exaggerated forms, but more

591
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.398
just straight up human forms. So that's, that's

592
00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:27.639
more attention to the human and more attention to the

593
00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:29.918
subjective. And then when you get to painting music

594
00:36:29.929 --> 00:36:34.849
and poetry, you're increasingly focusing humans attention on what's

595
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.438
going on inside of them as arts material. So

596
00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:43.340
color doesn't, I mean, it's let me put

597
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:45.699
it this way. It's more obvious to us that

598
00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:49.978
color doesn't exist in the world the way that stone

599
00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:52.378
exists in the world. OK. So Hagel still

600
00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:54.219
doesn't think that we should talk about stone as existing

601
00:36:54.289 --> 00:37:00.219
independently of us. But leaving that aside, painting

602
00:37:00.228 --> 00:37:05.760
more obviously points out to us our involvement in whatever

603
00:37:05.769 --> 00:37:07.059
is painted. And so I already talked about like

604
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.269
perspective, but that's true also of color. And

605
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.070
Hagel likes to talk about how it's possible for a

606
00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:15.909
human to see a form like a human, not

607
00:37:15.918 --> 00:37:21.570
even by drawing, but just by juxtaposing colors against

608
00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:22.969
each other. So even if there isn't a human

609
00:37:22.978 --> 00:37:25.429
form drawn, if you juxtapose the colors, a

610
00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:30.010
human will see a drawing where there isn't one,

611
00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:32.030
right? So again, more activity on the part

612
00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:35.539
of the subject and then music, as I was

613
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.070
saying a minute ago, same thing. Music is

614
00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:39.918
totally interior, right? So there we can't really

615
00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:44.449
talk about any material that's outside, like we can

616
00:37:44.458 --> 00:37:46.949
talk about the instruments, but the instruments aren't the

617
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:52.110
music and they certainly aren't my experience of the music

618
00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:57.000
. So that's totally interior and then poetry. So

619
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.898
Hagel and this is one of the the interesting differences

620
00:37:59.909 --> 00:38:01.780
between Hagel and other philosophers including Schopenhauer, right?

621
00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:06.128
So Schopenhauer puts music at the top because he wants

622
00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:09.789
really to highlight that kind of subjectivity. But Hagel

623
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:15.010
is always interested in the unity of identity and difference

624
00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:16.989
, right? So he doesn't want to stop at

625
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.119
subjectivity. He wants to go back to integrating subjectivity

626
00:38:22.128 --> 00:38:24.590
back into objectivity. And so when we get to

627
00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:30.228
poetry, we have um something that's 100% human creation

628
00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:36.389
, namely language as material, but it's, it's

629
00:38:36.398 --> 00:38:40.110
not as subjective as music because language is something that

630
00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:45.469
you and I have to agree on on some level

631
00:38:45.478 --> 00:38:46.559
. Otherwise it wouldn't count as language if I just

632
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.619
start, you know, speaking gibberish, that might

633
00:38:51.628 --> 00:38:53.119
be my private language, but it's not going to

634
00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:57.969
function like language unless I'm in dialogue, literally,

635
00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.679
not just with one person, but with a whole

636
00:38:59.688 --> 00:39:02.260
culture. So then when we get to as a

637
00:39:02.269 --> 00:39:07.579
kind of poetry, which then embodies language as this

638
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:12.820
very human creation and this very mutually formed creation back

639
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:16.239
into action, right? So then you have characters

640
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:21.179
embodied characters back to embodiment, embodied characters on a

641
00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:24.378
stage using language that's been mutually agreed upon, not

642
00:39:24.389 --> 00:39:28.989
just between individuals but by a culture. Then Hagel

643
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.070
thinks we've got a really profound experience of collective aesthetic

644
00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:39.010
creation that can unite us as a community while also

645
00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:45.059
showcasing the kind of subjectivity that a character like Antigone

646
00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:51.208
or Hamlet is experiencing. So, um so that's

647
00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:53.989
the way in which Hagel, that's why Hagel orders

648
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
them the way he orders them and decides that drama

649
00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.280
is the most complete form of aesthetic experience, which

650
00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:04.070
does not. And we'll probably get to this in

651
00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:07.820
a minute. Um Mean that he thinks that it's

652
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:10.599
the best form of art, but it is the

653
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:15.898
highest aesthetic experience philosophically for humans. You know,

654
00:40:15.909 --> 00:40:19.280
uh while you were talking, I was thinking at

655
00:40:19.289 --> 00:40:22.199
a certain point because you mentioned Schopenhauer there that uh

656
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:25.929
if um uh I mean, of course, you

657
00:40:25.938 --> 00:40:30.539
probably already alluded to some of that in your answer

658
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:35.769
. But uh I was wondering what extent Hegel's statics

659
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.949
also connects to his metaphysics because when you mentioned Schopenhauer

660
00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:42.889
, I mean, Schopenhauer is um a, at

661
00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:46.840
least for us more modern contemporary people, it's a

662
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:51.639
bit of a weird idea. But uh if,

663
00:40:51.648 --> 00:40:53.000
if I understand it correctly. I think that,

664
00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:58.809
uh OK, so, um Schopenhauer took that division

665
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.539
from Kent, uh the division between the Neuman and

666
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:06.579
, and the phenomenon and the phenomenons uh the Ninon

667
00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:10.929
sorry, supposedly is what reality itself is. I

668
00:41:10.938 --> 00:41:15.789
mean, the fundamental nature of reality. And uh

669
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.579
and this is also something I, I guess that

670
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.215
Nietzsche talks about in the, the origin of tragedy

671
00:41:21.224 --> 00:41:22.784
because back then in his first book, he was

672
00:41:22.793 --> 00:41:29.114
already very much influenced by Schopenhauer. He then uh

673
00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:32.853
uh left some of that out of his philosophy later

674
00:41:32.864 --> 00:41:37.804
on. But uh didn't Schopenhauer have this sort of

675
00:41:37.813 --> 00:41:45.195
idea that music itself was part of the fundamental nature

676
00:41:45.425 --> 00:41:47.909
of reality. Yeah. Absolutely. And that,

677
00:41:49.398 --> 00:41:52.570
and for Schopenhauer, the reason we love music so

678
00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:54.119
much and the reason it moves us so much is

679
00:41:54.128 --> 00:41:59.929
because it is the most raw experience of reality we

680
00:41:59.938 --> 00:42:02.469
can get. And uh absolutely, it, it

681
00:42:02.478 --> 00:42:05.489
moves us because it is also, you know,

682
00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.869
and this is, I think is, is the

683
00:42:06.878 --> 00:42:08.739
kind of thing Hagel thought too that the joy that

684
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.099
we get in it and in and its immediate access

685
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.478
to our emotions so that music can make us sad

686
00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:20.429
about nothing, right? So it's not if I

687
00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:22.320
listen to sad music, I'm not sad about anything

688
00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:25.599
. I'm just sad. That's incredible. Like the

689
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:31.019
fact that that's possible. Schopenhauer thinks says something really

690
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.059
profound about the nature of reality and about the nature

691
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.860
of being human. And I think Hagel is attuned

692
00:42:37.869 --> 00:42:39.699
to that as well. And it doesn't be again

693
00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:45.648
because he's more interested in thinking about a society in

694
00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:47.889
which people work together. I mean, Hagel,

695
00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:51.800
I sometimes say to my students is just more interested

696
00:42:51.809 --> 00:42:53.139
in like making sure that the society functions. And

697
00:42:53.148 --> 00:42:54.809
so he's, he's much more interested in saying,

698
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.969
OK, what institutions are going to be necessary for

699
00:42:58.978 --> 00:43:01.688
us to create a society in which humans can live

700
00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:04.668
to their full potential. And someone like Schopenhauer,

701
00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:06.829
as I understand him is, is just much less

702
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.039
interested in that. So I think Hagel wants to

703
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:13.590
pull back from this kind of ra education of subjectivity

704
00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:15.260
and say, OK, it's really good. It's

705
00:43:15.269 --> 00:43:20.260
really important fundamental to modern humans. Now, we've

706
00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:24.159
got to show how it can be fostered within institutions

707
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.179
. And so I think that's part of why um

708
00:43:27.989 --> 00:43:31.250
music doesn't top the list for him and to your

709
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.780
original question about metaphysics. Absolutely. I mean,

710
00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:37.039
this is the structure of reality as far as Hagel

711
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.800
is concerned, the identity of identity and difference.

712
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:43.809
And so the, the way in which the trajectory

713
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.769
of the arts, including music's subordinate place to drama

714
00:43:49.019 --> 00:43:52.918
into poetry in general is a metaphysical commitment on Hagel's

715
00:43:52.929 --> 00:43:57.929
part. Absolutely. Uh And uh I mean,

716
00:43:57.938 --> 00:44:01.309
you mentioned drama there. Uh Did Hegel have specific

717
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:07.539
views about tragedy and comedy? Yes, this is

718
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:12.688
something I thought about a lot. Um And probably

719
00:44:12.699 --> 00:44:14.869
many of your viewers will know that Hagel is most

720
00:44:14.878 --> 00:44:17.280
famous for talking about tragedy. So his interpretation of

721
00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:22.139
antigone has been in particular, very influential. And

722
00:44:22.148 --> 00:44:23.789
I mean, the thousands of pages that have been

723
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.148
written on that are testament to how, how important

724
00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:31.418
and revelatory his theory of tragedy was. But um

725
00:44:31.429 --> 00:44:35.500
much less attention has been paid to his theory of

726
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.570
comedy. And so I got really interested in that

727
00:44:37.579 --> 00:44:39.458
at a certain point. Um Both what Hagel says

728
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:43.739
about comedy and why it has been um not taken

729
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.059
as seriously, really quick answer to the second question

730
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:51.679
that's just really typical that philosophers um tend to take

731
00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:54.409
serious things more seriously. And unless you want to

732
00:44:54.418 --> 00:45:00.320
take comedy seriously and therefore risk being comic yourself because

733
00:45:00.599 --> 00:45:04.750
how ridiculous is it to take comedy seriously? Um

734
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.929
People don't do it. I, I have uh

735
00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:08.958
spent probably more time in my life than I should

736
00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:13.090
taking comedy very seriously. I teach a course on

737
00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:15.599
it. Um And that, that is in part

738
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.739
because I, yeah, I got interested in what

739
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.438
Hagel says about tragedy and comedy. So in short

740
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:22.010
, and I'm much more focused on what he says

741
00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:24.519
about it in his lectures on aesthetics rather than what

742
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.300
he says in the phenomenology. But I do think

743
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:32.369
they are, they are connected tragedy for Hegel shows

744
00:45:32.378 --> 00:45:39.309
a kind of subjectivity, very entrenched in itself and

745
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:44.438
in roles in particular in like social roles. So

746
00:45:44.449 --> 00:45:46.898
if you think about antigone, she is struggling with

747
00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:51.958
her role as a daughter and as a sister and

748
00:45:51.969 --> 00:45:53.340
as a subject, right? So her brothers have

749
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.688
been killed, she wants to bury one of them

750
00:45:55.699 --> 00:45:59.539
. She feels that that's her duty. Her uncle

751
00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.780
, the king is also her king now and she's

752
00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:05.378
supposed to obey him and he forbids this, um

753
00:46:05.389 --> 00:46:07.010
, since one of her brothers was a traitor.

754
00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:09.199
So the, the tragedy there is between two people

755
00:46:09.208 --> 00:46:13.688
who are deeply invested in their subjective relationships to their

756
00:46:13.699 --> 00:46:16.309
roles and those roles are incompatible. So there's no

757
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.648
way for it to end without one of them dying

758
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:22.889
. Um It's not several people die, but you

759
00:46:22.898 --> 00:46:24.179
know, of the two of them, only one

760
00:46:24.188 --> 00:46:28.280
of them dies. And so I, but in

761
00:46:28.289 --> 00:46:30.780
so far as Hegel is always interested in the unity

762
00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:34.780
of unity and division. What you get there is

763
00:46:34.789 --> 00:46:38.378
two people whose conflict with each other cancels itself out

764
00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:40.889
and then what you get at the end the synthesis

765
00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:44.550
. Although Hagel doesn't use that word is the survival

766
00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:50.378
of the Greek City state with increased knowledge of how

767
00:46:50.389 --> 00:46:52.389
those roles have to be treated within the Polish.

768
00:46:52.398 --> 00:46:57.418
So Creon ends the play essentially admitting that he shouldn't

769
00:46:57.429 --> 00:47:00.090
have had the attitude that he had to his role

770
00:47:00.418 --> 00:47:05.099
. So, so for Hagel, the reason that

771
00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.418
tragedy is art is because it shows this clash,

772
00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:15.139
which ends in a kind of unification comedy, also

773
00:47:15.148 --> 00:47:20.500
ancient comedy and Hagel's favorite is Aristophanes also ends in

774
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.360
reunification. But it's because like if you take streps

775
00:47:24.679 --> 00:47:27.780
sides as an example in the clouds, he doesn't

776
00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:30.329
take himself so seriously. So he, you know

777
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.260
, kind of goofs around and he undermines the city

778
00:47:32.269 --> 00:47:35.059
and then, you know, he cheats and he

779
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.219
, and he's never like fixed on his role and

780
00:47:38.228 --> 00:47:42.360
that gives him an enormous amount of power. And

781
00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:44.550
so in the clouds, in particular, you also

782
00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:46.780
see the, like the beginning of the erosion of

783
00:47:46.789 --> 00:47:50.659
the idea that the gods are really in control because

784
00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:52.168
they're being mocked in strips and, and they had

785
00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:55.309
been before, this isn't new in Aristophanes necessarily.

786
00:47:55.478 --> 00:47:57.688
But at the end of that, you get a

787
00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:01.610
kind of cheerful reunification. And Hegel actually says,

788
00:48:01.619 --> 00:48:05.849
um at another point, you know, maybe that's

789
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.280
better, you know, why would we choose the

790
00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:16.438
dark and um desperate conflict of tragedy over the cheerful

791
00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:19.039
life affirming? And I think there's a lot of

792
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.320
this in Nietzsche too, life affirming laughter of someone

793
00:48:22.329 --> 00:48:25.360
who doesn't have to be so beholden to his roles

794
00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:29.159
that he's willing to bring the whole society down around

795
00:48:29.168 --> 00:48:30.469
him. So there's a, there's a, an

796
00:48:30.478 --> 00:48:32.728
extended story that I'm happy to tell if, if

797
00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:38.530
you're interested um about how that changes in modern tragedy

798
00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:42.668
and modern comedy. Um But Hagel is pretty pessimistic

799
00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:45.679
about both mo modern tragedy and modern comedy. Um

800
00:48:45.688 --> 00:48:49.489
And essentially, I think, thinks that we're going

801
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.469
to have to transcend both of them or, and

802
00:48:52.478 --> 00:48:53.559
this is another big topic, move to more of

803
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:59.389
a humor based aesthetic than a comedy based aesthetic,

804
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.590
right? Uh I'm going to ask you more about

805
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:05.628
that, about modern comedy and tragedy in a second

806
00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:06.978
. But I, I mean, I just wanted

807
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:09.329
to make a brief comment because this was to some

808
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.688
extent, I mean, uh the, the way

809
00:49:12.699 --> 00:49:15.458
people like Hegel, Schopenhauer Nietzsche and others in the

810
00:49:15.469 --> 00:49:22.139
19th century approached uh aesthetics and art uh somewhat reminds

811
00:49:22.148 --> 00:49:29.500
me of uh how dismissive uh the post Socratic were

812
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.219
of the Pres Socratic because the Pre Socratic took the

813
00:49:34.228 --> 00:49:37.860
poets and uh seriously when it comes to uh I

814
00:49:37.869 --> 00:49:43.179
mean, perhaps uh also being able to acquire some

815
00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:46.820
sort of knowledge through art, through fiction and all

816
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:49.280
of that. And I, and I, and

817
00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:51.019
I mean, of course, I, I don't

818
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.340
think we can really be sure about what part of

819
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:58.360
it came from Socrates or Plato because sometimes we don't

820
00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:01.648
know for sure if it's Socrates or Plato talking,

821
00:50:01.659 --> 00:50:06.199
but in Plato's works. But anyway, I,

822
00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:09.735
I mean, the Socrates and the, the other

823
00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:15.273
Greek philosophers who came after him were very dismissive of

824
00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:20.144
Homer specifically and the other poets. And when you

825
00:50:20.155 --> 00:50:23.614
think about the Pres Socratic and even what we call

826
00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:25.804
the Sophists, I, I mean, nowadays,

827
00:50:25.813 --> 00:50:30.353
sophistry has a very negative connotation to it, but

828
00:50:30.364 --> 00:50:35.494
the Sophists were very much philosophers themselves, I think

829
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.159
. Uh so I, I wa I was just

830
00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:39.550
, I mean, it just came to my mind

831
00:50:39.559 --> 00:50:44.719
that uh there are, there have been periods in

832
00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:50.079
Western philosophy, where people have very much been dismissive

833
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.195
of art, at least as a potential source of

834
00:50:53.204 --> 00:51:00.253
some kind of knowledge and others where people really engaged

835
00:51:00.434 --> 00:51:06.574
with art seriously and philosophically took art seriously. Yeah

836
00:51:06.635 --> 00:51:07.994
. Absolutely. Yeah. And I think this is

837
00:51:08.003 --> 00:51:10.583
the 19th century, is one place where that pen

838
00:51:10.644 --> 00:51:15.789
direction. So tell us about the issues that Hegel

839
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:23.039
had with modern forms of art, particularly uh with

840
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:28.320
what we could call, I guess modern subjectivity in

841
00:51:28.329 --> 00:51:31.320
art because uh as time went on and particularly since

842
00:51:31.329 --> 00:51:34.829
the, I guess, more or less the 19th

843
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.809
century onwards, I mean, in literature and other

844
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:44.128
forms of art, we see people focusing more on

845
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:50.554
particular characters and character development and there's objectivity even what

846
00:51:50.563 --> 00:51:54.224
goes on in their minds through ex through lots and

847
00:51:54.235 --> 00:51:59.543
lots of, of, of texts sometimes just focusing

848
00:51:59.554 --> 00:52:01.054
on their inner thoughts and all of that. II

849
00:52:01.063 --> 00:52:05.945
, I guess that's what we could call a modern

850
00:52:05.954 --> 00:52:09.353
subjectivity in art to uh or perhaps there's also some

851
00:52:09.364 --> 00:52:14.824
other forms of subjectivity. But what did Hegel think

852
00:52:14.833 --> 00:52:16.648
about it? I think one of the best places

853
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:20.878
to isolate that is in what he says about humor

854
00:52:20.889 --> 00:52:23.769
. And yeah, and I think humor was a

855
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:29.750
really new aesthetic phenomenon. It essentially began with Lawrence

856
00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.929
Stern's Tristam Shandy, which was enormously popular in Germany

857
00:52:34.938 --> 00:52:38.090
. I mean, Goethe and Schiller and Lessing and

858
00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:45.320
anybody who was anybody um loved Stern and his evocation

859
00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:50.289
of characters who were not comic in the classic sense

860
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.458
of like, Aristophanes. Um, but were kind

861
00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:59.369
of quirky and had foibles and eccentricities that made you

862
00:52:59.378 --> 00:53:00.878
kind of gently laugh at them. So, not

863
00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:07.989
mock them, not guffaw but, but just recognize

864
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.219
how much humans get obsessed with what stern called their

865
00:53:13.228 --> 00:53:15.679
hobby horses. Like their little things that they're,

866
00:53:15.688 --> 00:53:17.800
the, the little things that they wanna be obsessed

867
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:20.340
about. So, you know, whether it's your

868
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:22.269
train set or his, you know, his uncle's

869
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.938
military, uh what was it? It wasn't exactly

870
00:53:25.958 --> 00:53:29.860
a like models, I guess. Anyway, um

871
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:34.050
So Hagel thought that comedy and, and humor needed

872
00:53:34.059 --> 00:53:36.570
to be differentiated as, as did um pretty much

873
00:53:36.579 --> 00:53:39.110
everybody in his um generation. So comedy as a

874
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:43.208
kind of dramatic art form and humor as something that

875
00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:50.090
more suffused literature and poetry and that highlighted again this

876
00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:52.369
sense that what is really important to pay attention to

877
00:53:52.378 --> 00:53:58.708
among humans now is that since we've discovered as it

878
00:53:58.719 --> 00:54:00.938
were that we are the source of meaning in the

879
00:54:00.949 --> 00:54:05.000
world, what is meaningful to us and how kind

880
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.409
of adorably silly that often is like how adorably silly

881
00:54:08.659 --> 00:54:13.398
many of our concerns are. And I think Hegel

882
00:54:13.409 --> 00:54:19.168
thought that was really valuable aesthetically because it brought attention

883
00:54:19.179 --> 00:54:22.119
to, you know, the the concerns of art

884
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:25.769
are no longer the gods or big battles or even

885
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:30.648
like sublime landscapes, but like Dutch genre paintings or

886
00:54:30.659 --> 00:54:37.320
still lifes that show tiny little involved human obsessions with

887
00:54:37.329 --> 00:54:39.610
flowers or having your tooth pulled or, you know

888
00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:44.199
, like everyday human things, but he did not

889
00:54:44.208 --> 00:54:47.599
like it when people became so subjective that they didn't

890
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:53.168
try to extract any larger meaning from whatever it was

891
00:54:53.179 --> 00:54:57.099
that they were doing. So he was very critical

892
00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.889
of Jean Paul Richter on this point, very critical

893
00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:04.188
of people like Schlegel, Friedrich Schlegel. And you

894
00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:06.769
know, to a lesser extent, people like Novalis

895
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.418
who Hagel thought were way too focused on their own

896
00:55:10.429 --> 00:55:15.519
interiority and stream of consciousness essentially as you were just

897
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:19.829
describing and therefore, again, never made the connection

898
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.728
back from subjectivity back into objectivity and therefore, were

899
00:55:23.739 --> 00:55:29.550
not giving their audiences an experience of the truth.

900
00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.389
So that's always what's at stake for Hagel. Um

901
00:55:31.398 --> 00:55:35.550
So he's very critical of what he calls subjective humor

902
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.789
and very admiring of what he calls objective humor.

903
00:55:39.398 --> 00:55:43.389
Do you think that Hagel would have been a,

904
00:55:43.398 --> 00:55:46.699
a fan? Or at least like to some extent

905
00:55:46.708 --> 00:55:53.438
the existentialists, do you think that Hegel would have

906
00:55:53.449 --> 00:55:58.320
been a, a fan or at least like to

907
00:55:58.329 --> 00:56:05.809
some extent the existentialists? I'm not so sure he

908
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.478
would have been to be honest with you. I

909
00:56:07.489 --> 00:56:10.148
think he, he, as I said earlier,

910
00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:14.829
he was really interested in making a society function on

911
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.579
an institutional level. So what kind of form of

912
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:20.389
government do we need? What kind of um social

913
00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:22.489
order, what kind of economic order, what kind

914
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:27.679
of family situation and in so far as existentialists and

915
00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:34.610
this is generalizing but often emphasize the subject in opposition

916
00:56:34.619 --> 00:56:37.610
to those things. I think Hagel would have again

917
00:56:37.619 --> 00:56:39.378
, felt like, well, but what we're after

918
00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:42.628
here is truth, which is the unity of unity

919
00:56:42.639 --> 00:56:45.208
and division, not just division. And we have

920
00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:49.030
a world to run like it's our responsibility to run

921
00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:51.590
this world. There's no God out there to help

922
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:52.628
us out, there's no natural order like we've got

923
00:56:52.639 --> 00:56:55.909
to get this right. And if there's, and

924
00:56:55.918 --> 00:57:00.500
again, this is to caricature. But if existentialists

925
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:05.699
are sometimes seen as self obsessed or just as oppositional

926
00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:07.639
to the order, I think Hagel would have been

927
00:57:07.648 --> 00:57:12.208
much more interested in reforming the order in ways that

928
00:57:12.219 --> 00:57:15.250
would better allow humans to be free and the way

929
00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.139
he thought humans needed to be free. And that

930
00:57:17.148 --> 00:57:19.918
back to something we were saying a minute ago,

931
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.039
I think this is something that Marx picks up from

932
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:25.449
. Hagel is very much about what kind of material

933
00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:29.849
conditions do humans need in order to be free.

934
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.909
So it's not enough to say as Kant did um

935
00:57:32.918 --> 00:57:36.489
that you're free if you're self determining and can act

936
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.570
against your inclinations in accordance with the categorical imperative.

937
00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:42.110
I realize that Kant scholars are going to say that

938
00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:43.570
that's not all he meant. And, and I

939
00:57:43.579 --> 00:57:45.619
accept that, but Hagel was much more explicit in

940
00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:50.378
trying to say what real freedom means is paying attention

941
00:57:50.389 --> 00:57:54.139
to what people need in institutions around them. And

942
00:57:54.438 --> 00:57:57.958
you know, just life forms around them in order

943
00:57:57.969 --> 00:58:00.139
to be, to flourish as humans with dignity and

944
00:58:00.148 --> 00:58:02.989
respect. So again, that's maybe too hard on

945
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.500
the existentialist. But I, I think that might

946
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:10.219
be his general take. That's very interesting because o

947
00:58:10.228 --> 00:58:14.909
of course, we know that Marx was influenced by

948
00:58:14.918 --> 00:58:19.590
Hegel to some extent, but sometimes because people have

949
00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:23.369
these simplistic views of Hegel and Marx they think,

950
00:58:23.378 --> 00:58:27.119
oh, how could it be? Because Hegel was

951
00:58:27.128 --> 00:58:31.269
supposedly a big idealist and Marx was a me realist

952
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.030
. I mean, how could they be more opposite

953
00:58:35.039 --> 00:58:37.590
? But uh I mean, what you mentioned there

954
00:58:37.599 --> 00:58:40.659
and uh Hegel caring very much about how we structure

955
00:58:40.668 --> 00:58:45.590
society, about the institutions we create and how we

956
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:50.909
create them based on what values, I guess.

957
00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:54.418
Uh I mean, it's very much uh I guess

958
00:58:54.429 --> 00:59:00.780
also applied philosophy or political philosophy as some of what

959
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:05.789
Marx also cared about. Absolutely. And I,

960
00:59:05.978 --> 00:59:07.769
you know, I think another thing that you can

961
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.539
find in Hegel that I think is just much more

962
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.599
clearly articulated in Marx is that freedom can be a

963
00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:20.639
kind of ideological lie if you continue to tell people

964
00:59:20.648 --> 00:59:23.199
that they're free as a way of distracting them from

965
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:27.648
the fact that they're being exploited and alienated, right

966
00:59:27.659 --> 00:59:30.030
? So if you make people focus on, yes

967
00:59:30.039 --> 00:59:31.668
, but I'm a free and determining being because I

968
00:59:31.679 --> 00:59:34.789
can follow the categorical imperative, which I, I

969
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:38.280
again, that's a caricature. Um Then people are

970
00:59:38.289 --> 00:59:39.559
going to feel like, well, you know,

971
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:44.750
who cares what sort of deprived economic situation I live

972
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.188
in. I'm still free and Hagel, I think

973
00:59:46.199 --> 00:59:50.489
, worried that that kind, that, that kind

974
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.659
of idea could fall into the wrong hands of people

975
00:59:53.668 --> 00:59:58.458
who knew how to manipulate it. Such that exactly

976
00:59:58.469 --> 00:59:59.739
as you said, you know, you can be

977
00:59:59.750 --> 00:60:00.800
a, a worker who's being totally exploited. But

978
00:60:00.809 --> 00:60:04.530
as long as you're told that there's a kind of

979
00:60:04.539 --> 00:60:08.648
freedom that exists in transcending that or not caring about

980
00:60:08.659 --> 00:60:10.809
it or, or that actually, you know what

981
00:60:10.820 --> 00:60:14.909
it is to be human is to, to subsist

982
00:60:14.918 --> 00:60:17.789
despite the struggle of economic depravity, I think Hagel

983
00:60:17.800 --> 00:60:21.929
also would say that's just, that's manipulative, it's

984
00:60:21.938 --> 00:60:24.208
deceitful and it's unethical. Uh it's, it's,

985
00:60:24.219 --> 00:60:27.000
it is not, it is false freedom, it

986
00:60:27.010 --> 00:60:29.500
is empty, fake, false freedom. And it

987
00:60:29.510 --> 00:60:30.878
can be a kind of uh a tool in the

988
00:60:30.889 --> 00:60:35.409
hands of people who want to manipulate others into ignoring

989
00:60:35.418 --> 00:60:37.269
the ways in which they're being exploited, which is

990
00:60:37.280 --> 00:60:40.510
very interesting because I guess that this is also another

991
00:60:40.519 --> 00:60:44.708
idea that people do not tend at all to associate

992
00:60:44.719 --> 00:60:49.188
with Hegel. But as Marx, he also cared

993
00:60:49.199 --> 00:60:52.458
about the poverty, right? And about the causes

994
00:60:52.469 --> 00:60:57.168
of poverty and the potential effects it would have on

995
00:60:57.179 --> 00:61:00.579
people's behavior. Correct. Yeah. So this is

996
00:61:00.590 --> 00:61:02.019
specifically in the passages where he talks about what's called

997
00:61:02.030 --> 00:61:05.590
the rabble. And, and I think this is

998
00:61:05.599 --> 00:61:08.449
again, a distinction that Marx picks up on that

999
00:61:08.458 --> 00:61:12.760
what Hagel means by the rabble is not just people

1000
00:61:12.769 --> 00:61:15.389
who are impoverished. So and Hagel, like many

1001
00:61:15.398 --> 00:61:20.800
people thinks that there will always be poverty. But

1002
00:61:20.809 --> 00:61:24.250
what's new since, you know, well, not

1003
00:61:24.260 --> 00:61:28.389
new now, but new since the modern world essentially

1004
00:61:28.559 --> 00:61:32.398
is the claim that all humans are worthy of dignity

1005
00:61:32.409 --> 00:61:37.590
and respect and the acknowledgement or just the fact that

1006
00:61:37.599 --> 00:61:44.188
our economies are human creations. So whereas poverty before

1007
00:61:44.208 --> 00:61:46.750
could be explained just by natural phenomenon or just by

1008
00:61:46.760 --> 00:61:50.300
a hierarchy that we were told was natural. You

1009
00:61:50.309 --> 00:61:51.679
know, the king gets to be rich and you

1010
00:61:51.688 --> 00:61:54.219
have to be poor because God made him the king

1011
00:61:54.228 --> 00:61:58.889
and made you a pauper. Now, the combination

1012
00:61:58.898 --> 00:62:00.059
of the claim that all humans are worthy of dignity

1013
00:62:00.070 --> 00:62:05.728
and respect and a human created economy, that means

1014
00:62:05.739 --> 00:62:09.679
that many people live in total depravity generates a kind

1015
00:62:09.688 --> 00:62:15.458
of rage on the part of what Hagel then calls

1016
00:62:15.469 --> 00:62:17.619
the rabble. Um that is entirely justified and that

1017
00:62:17.628 --> 00:62:22.340
Hagel sees as a pretty existential threat to modern society

1018
00:62:22.349 --> 00:62:24.090
because they're right, right. It's, it's not

1019
00:62:24.099 --> 00:62:27.519
that we need them to get over this fact that

1020
00:62:27.530 --> 00:62:30.320
they're right about it. And as long as that's

1021
00:62:30.329 --> 00:62:32.369
true, they, you know, society will be

1022
00:62:32.378 --> 00:62:37.639
unstable because they will correctly demand the material conditions.

1023
00:62:37.648 --> 00:62:42.199
For the thing that they're told is their kind of

1024
00:62:42.208 --> 00:62:45.139
existential, right. So in HGL talks about ways

1025
00:62:45.148 --> 00:62:49.648
to solve that through essentially what we would call labor

1026
00:62:49.659 --> 00:62:54.719
unions or other forms within civil society that would and

1027
00:62:54.728 --> 00:63:00.559
within the government that would represent not just geographical interests

1028
00:63:00.659 --> 00:63:04.378
but economic interests. So when, when you look

1029
00:63:04.389 --> 00:63:06.519
at what Hagel says about the form the state should

1030
00:63:06.530 --> 00:63:08.110
take, I think one of the most overlooked facts

1031
00:63:08.340 --> 00:63:14.030
is that he does not want purely geographical representation.

1032
00:63:14.269 --> 00:63:15.239
He doesn't want, you know, Prussia gets two

1033
00:63:15.250 --> 00:63:19.079
delegates and Bavaria gets two delegates and no following is

1034
00:63:19.090 --> 00:63:23.519
two delegates but that different classes and different kinds of

1035
00:63:23.530 --> 00:63:28.918
um of industry get representation. So that to me

1036
00:63:28.929 --> 00:63:31.418
is very clear evidence that he was worried about not

1037
00:63:31.429 --> 00:63:36.619
just the material conditions of capitalism, but also the

1038
00:63:36.628 --> 00:63:40.699
questions of identity and self-respect that are necessary in the

1039
00:63:40.708 --> 00:63:45.030
modern work world um that are essentially trampled on by

1040
00:63:45.039 --> 00:63:51.688
capitalism. And so um could we say that Hegel

1041
00:63:51.699 --> 00:63:54.809
like Marx was also or thought that it was a

1042
00:63:54.820 --> 00:64:00.668
moral imperative for society to try as best as we

1043
00:64:00.679 --> 00:64:04.989
could to alleviate or ideally eradicate poverty? Yeah,

1044
00:64:05.000 --> 00:64:08.489
absolutely. I I don't think Hale thought it could

1045
00:64:08.500 --> 00:64:12.208
be completely eradicated. But um yeah, I there's

1046
00:64:12.219 --> 00:64:14.398
no question in my mind that he saw this as

1047
00:64:14.409 --> 00:64:17.599
the deepest and most insidious kind of hypocrisy that a

1048
00:64:17.610 --> 00:64:21.349
society would say on the one hand that everyone is

1049
00:64:21.360 --> 00:64:28.010
equal and deserving of dignity and respect and then continue

1050
00:64:28.360 --> 00:64:33.869
to choose um an an economic system that made that

1051
00:64:33.889 --> 00:64:36.449
a joke, right? And it's very bad joke

1052
00:64:36.458 --> 00:64:39.550
, a sad joke. Um It made it laughable

1053
00:64:39.559 --> 00:64:42.188
in the worst possible way. And that a society

1054
00:64:42.199 --> 00:64:49.168
that continues down that road is both morally responsible and

1055
00:64:49.179 --> 00:64:51.280
in danger of instability. So I do, I

1056
00:64:51.289 --> 00:64:54.438
do think Hagel thinks those two things are separate.

1057
00:64:54.550 --> 00:64:57.378
So a better functioning society is going to be 11

1058
00:64:57.389 --> 00:65:00.699
with less inequality. But also that totally aside,

1059
00:65:00.708 --> 00:65:01.679
just as a moral issue. Um yeah, this

1060
00:65:01.688 --> 00:65:06.269
is a classic failure and just to be totally clear

1061
00:65:06.280 --> 00:65:09.599
because at a certain point there, you mentioned the

1062
00:65:09.610 --> 00:65:13.820
fact that some of these ideas stem from the more

1063
00:65:13.829 --> 00:65:18.179
general idea that people, individual, people themselves have

1064
00:65:18.188 --> 00:65:21.628
intrinsic value. I mean, this is not just

1065
00:65:21.639 --> 00:65:28.148
a matter of caring about alleviating poverty with the long

1066
00:65:28.159 --> 00:65:30.289
term success of a particular society in mind, but

1067
00:65:30.300 --> 00:65:36.989
also caring actually about the individuals themselves and the conditions

1068
00:65:38.168 --> 00:65:44.239
they live in. Yes and their emotional and effective

1069
00:65:44.250 --> 00:65:46.739
attachment to their value as workers. So when he

1070
00:65:46.750 --> 00:65:49.739
starts to talk about solutions to this kind of poverty

1071
00:65:49.750 --> 00:65:51.539
, he says, you know, you can certainly

1072
00:65:51.550 --> 00:65:58.539
get government agencies involved in essentially welfare, but that's

1073
00:65:58.550 --> 00:66:00.628
not going to fix the problem of self-respect. You

1074
00:66:00.639 --> 00:66:04.159
have to give people the possibility of having dignity in

1075
00:66:04.168 --> 00:66:08.418
their work if work is going to be such a

1076
00:66:08.429 --> 00:66:12.938
central part of existence in a capitalist system. Um

1077
00:66:12.949 --> 00:66:14.869
And so yeah, ju I mean, just trying

1078
00:66:14.878 --> 00:66:17.418
to eradicate it through philanthropy is also not going to

1079
00:66:17.429 --> 00:66:19.780
fix the problem. It has to come at the

1080
00:66:19.789 --> 00:66:25.510
level of actually valuing workers in their roles as workers

1081
00:66:26.429 --> 00:66:28.978
. Oh my God. So it was not just

1082
00:66:28.989 --> 00:66:31.929
that Marx was an alien but Hagel was also a

1083
00:66:31.938 --> 00:66:35.208
Marxist. Well, not everybody would agree with me

1084
00:66:35.219 --> 00:66:35.989
. But, but, yeah, I mean,

1085
00:66:36.000 --> 00:66:38.500
I, I think that's all, that's all very

1086
00:66:38.510 --> 00:66:39.969
clear to me. Um, that, that is

1087
00:66:39.978 --> 00:66:42.409
part of what Hagel was concerned about and, you

1088
00:66:42.418 --> 00:66:45.168
know, there are places in his philosophy where he

1089
00:66:45.179 --> 00:66:47.389
is also guilty of that kind of hypocrisy. So

1090
00:66:47.398 --> 00:66:49.769
it's not as if he had some sort of moral

1091
00:66:49.780 --> 00:66:53.429
genius that allowed him to see that in other parts

1092
00:66:53.438 --> 00:66:55.349
of his life. But I, I think that

1093
00:66:55.360 --> 00:66:58.648
was one place where he really did see the dangers

1094
00:66:58.659 --> 00:67:01.168
that we are living with very presently now. Yeah

1095
00:67:01.179 --> 00:67:02.168
. No, but I mean, I, I

1096
00:67:02.179 --> 00:67:05.260
made, I made that sort of a joke but

1097
00:67:05.478 --> 00:67:08.570
, uh, uh, I, if, uh

1098
00:67:08.579 --> 00:67:11.668
, he's, if you didn't mention his name,

1099
00:67:11.679 --> 00:67:15.050
just everything you said about poverty and capitalism that we

1100
00:67:15.059 --> 00:67:18.789
should structure society and all of that, I mean

1101
00:67:19.360 --> 00:67:23.398
, if someone told me it was Marx to,

1102
00:67:24.280 --> 00:67:27.188
I won't believe it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1103
00:67:27.320 --> 00:67:29.039
. Yeah. I think that's true and that would

1104
00:67:29.050 --> 00:67:30.648
be true until we started talking about the state.

1105
00:67:30.659 --> 00:67:32.898
Right. So Hagel talks about all of this when

1106
00:67:32.909 --> 00:67:35.500
he's talking about civil society, which is the middle

1107
00:67:35.510 --> 00:67:38.000
one of the. So he talks about the family

1108
00:67:38.010 --> 00:67:40.559
and civil society and the state and its, when

1109
00:67:40.570 --> 00:67:42.898
he starts to talk about the state that you would

1110
00:67:42.909 --> 00:67:45.849
no longer think we were talking about Marx. Great

1111
00:67:45.860 --> 00:67:48.128
. So, uh we've already talked here a little

1112
00:67:48.139 --> 00:67:53.148
bit about uh comedy, but one of the things

1113
00:67:53.159 --> 00:67:56.030
you've also done work on, uh and again,

1114
00:67:56.039 --> 00:68:01.469
focusing on uh 19th century German philosophy is how seriously

1115
00:68:01.478 --> 00:68:06.869
some of these philosophers took laughter. Right. Yeah

1116
00:68:06.878 --> 00:68:11.699
. Or we might say like the laughable because it

1117
00:68:11.708 --> 00:68:14.789
, it's so hard to put all of the things

1118
00:68:14.800 --> 00:68:15.668
that we laugh at under uh and, and a

1119
00:68:15.680 --> 00:68:17.759
lot of things that are laughable, we don't actually

1120
00:68:17.770 --> 00:68:20.779
laugh at. So it's, it's a very thorny

1121
00:68:20.789 --> 00:68:26.088
um topic. But, but yes, especially around

1122
00:68:26.100 --> 00:68:28.958
the time when Hagel was writing. Um again,

1123
00:68:28.970 --> 00:68:31.430
people like Schlegel, um and some of the other

1124
00:68:31.439 --> 00:68:36.770
more romantic philosophers like Zolar um were taking this question

1125
00:68:36.779 --> 00:68:39.699
of what we laugh at and why or, or

1126
00:68:39.708 --> 00:68:44.378
what it means to differentiate between wit and irony and

1127
00:68:44.390 --> 00:68:47.060
humor really seriously. And I think that, uh

1128
00:68:47.069 --> 00:68:49.220
you know, Lessing was another one who took this

1129
00:68:49.229 --> 00:68:54.600
very seriously. Um Eta Hoffman, like the whole

1130
00:68:54.609 --> 00:68:58.220
constellation of people who were philosophical, but also writing

1131
00:68:58.239 --> 00:69:01.039
in literature. Um And I think again, it

1132
00:69:01.048 --> 00:69:02.680
comes back to this question, like, what does

1133
00:69:02.689 --> 00:69:06.458
it say about humans that we laugh? And what

1134
00:69:06.470 --> 00:69:09.899
does it say about us that we find this whole

1135
00:69:09.909 --> 00:69:12.619
range of things either funny or laughable? And what

1136
00:69:12.628 --> 00:69:15.399
could we determine about the essence of what it is

1137
00:69:15.409 --> 00:69:17.918
to be human by really trying to figure that out

1138
00:69:18.239 --> 00:69:21.720
? And if you're someone like Schlegel who thinks that

1139
00:69:21.729 --> 00:69:28.789
Hegel is wrong to imagine that we can articulate truth

1140
00:69:28.798 --> 00:69:32.699
in philosophy, then you're going to be looking towards

1141
00:69:32.708 --> 00:69:36.140
other forms that maybe as Schlegel would sort of put

1142
00:69:36.149 --> 00:69:42.060
it gesture at the truth while not articulating it.

1143
00:69:42.149 --> 00:69:45.789
Because articulating it is always going to introduce new categories

1144
00:69:45.798 --> 00:69:48.918
and therefore new division. So if the true is

1145
00:69:48.930 --> 00:69:51.878
the whole, I think Schlegel would say to Hegel

1146
00:69:53.060 --> 00:69:58.000
, um any conceptualization is just going to show the

1147
00:69:58.009 --> 00:70:00.770
division again. And if you want something that retains

1148
00:70:00.779 --> 00:70:03.939
the unity, it has to remain at the level

1149
00:70:03.949 --> 00:70:11.708
of affect or something like irony, which doesn't take

1150
00:70:11.720 --> 00:70:15.548
itself too seriously and doesn't define things, but sort

1151
00:70:15.560 --> 00:70:19.189
of says that things are true through saying they're opposite

1152
00:70:19.399 --> 00:70:24.250
or says something that's witty in a way that you

1153
00:70:24.259 --> 00:70:27.029
don't take literally, but you see the truth behind

1154
00:70:27.039 --> 00:70:29.430
it. Um So all of these are ways in

1155
00:70:29.439 --> 00:70:32.229
which a whole range of people in the romantic generation

1156
00:70:32.548 --> 00:70:35.399
decided that if we could understand that and the way

1157
00:70:35.409 --> 00:70:40.140
that functions in the way humans interact with each other

1158
00:70:40.149 --> 00:70:42.659
and lead our aesthetic lives, then we could probably

1159
00:70:42.668 --> 00:70:46.039
understand something much deeper about humans themselves and about metaphysics

1160
00:70:46.048 --> 00:70:48.798
quite honestly. Um So there's a lot of um

1161
00:70:48.810 --> 00:70:51.958
I edited a volume of essays about uh humor in

1162
00:70:51.970 --> 00:70:55.159
the 19th century. And as I say in the

1163
00:70:55.168 --> 00:70:58.539
introduction, usually when I tell people that they laugh

1164
00:70:58.548 --> 00:71:00.259
because um one of the things we laugh at is

1165
00:71:00.270 --> 00:71:05.850
incongruity and it feels so incongruous to talk about humor

1166
00:71:05.859 --> 00:71:09.789
in this generation of very serious philosophers, but it

1167
00:71:09.798 --> 00:71:13.250
is something they took really seriously. And I mean

1168
00:71:13.259 --> 00:71:16.220
, trying to understand something about our human nature through

1169
00:71:16.229 --> 00:71:19.798
laughter. I mean, there are many different ways

1170
00:71:19.810 --> 00:71:21.529
we can try to understand it. Right. And

1171
00:71:21.539 --> 00:71:26.789
I mean, even philosophers themselves, many different philosophers

1172
00:71:26.798 --> 00:71:31.430
across history uh have had different theories about why people

1173
00:71:31.439 --> 00:71:33.859
laugh at something. And, uh, I,

1174
00:71:33.869 --> 00:71:36.180
I mean, perhaps all of them are true.

1175
00:71:36.189 --> 00:71:40.899
I don't know because some, we laugh at different

1176
00:71:40.909 --> 00:71:44.779
things in different contexts for different reasons. I mean

1177
00:71:44.789 --> 00:71:47.529
, sometimes we might laugh at something because it's funny

1178
00:71:47.539 --> 00:71:53.458
and why it's funny is an entire question by itself

1179
00:71:53.470 --> 00:71:58.009
. But uh sometimes perhaps people laugh at someone to

1180
00:71:58.020 --> 00:72:00.208
mock them. Not exactly because it's funny, but

1181
00:72:00.220 --> 00:72:04.569
just to mock them or to feel superior to other

1182
00:72:04.579 --> 00:72:09.449
people, perhaps something, someone does something wrong.

1183
00:72:09.470 --> 00:72:12.289
Uh And they are, I mean, competing with

1184
00:72:12.298 --> 00:72:15.289
them and then the other person laughs just because,

1185
00:72:15.298 --> 00:72:16.789
oh, you made the mistake. So I'm in

1186
00:72:16.798 --> 00:72:19.000
a, in a better situation than you are or

1187
00:72:19.009 --> 00:72:21.000
something like that. So, I mean, the

1188
00:72:21.009 --> 00:72:27.609
, uh just thinking about laughter itself and the many

1189
00:72:27.619 --> 00:72:32.548
different contexts and reasons why people laugh is, uh

1190
00:72:32.649 --> 00:72:36.270
, I mean, it's, it's a very wide

1191
00:72:36.600 --> 00:72:41.180
uh field of inquiry, I guess. Yeah,

1192
00:72:41.189 --> 00:72:45.470
absolutely. Yeah. OK. So, um let's

1193
00:72:45.479 --> 00:72:53.279
get now into uh how you got interested in abolitionism

1194
00:72:53.390 --> 00:72:56.759
in America in the 19th century. So, tell

1195
00:72:56.770 --> 00:72:59.878
us first about that. What got you interested in

1196
00:72:59.890 --> 00:73:02.850
that and then we'll get into the work of Lydia

1197
00:73:02.859 --> 00:73:08.750
Maria Child. Yeah, this was, um,

1198
00:73:08.759 --> 00:73:13.750
a very direct response on my part to the 2016

1199
00:73:13.759 --> 00:73:15.020
election in the United States. So when, when

1200
00:73:15.029 --> 00:73:18.390
Donald Trump was elected, um it became very clear

1201
00:73:18.399 --> 00:73:20.009
to many of us that we were in a kind

1202
00:73:20.020 --> 00:73:25.189
of moral and political emergency. Uh So the real

1203
00:73:25.199 --> 00:73:29.409
resurgence of a kind of far right, political stance

1204
00:73:29.418 --> 00:73:31.628
and all of the other things that Trump represented,

1205
00:73:31.979 --> 00:73:38.399
including his um just open derision of and abuse of

1206
00:73:38.409 --> 00:73:43.220
women. And I think as a Hagel scholar,

1207
00:73:43.739 --> 00:73:46.619
I've always had to grapple a little bit with what

1208
00:73:46.628 --> 00:73:50.119
, how I felt when I would read Hagel scholarship

1209
00:73:50.128 --> 00:73:56.310
from the 19 thirties. And I would always have

1210
00:73:56.319 --> 00:73:59.180
in the back of my mind, what did this

1211
00:73:59.189 --> 00:74:01.500
person think they were doing? Um was what they

1212
00:74:01.509 --> 00:74:04.729
were doing more important than anything they could have been

1213
00:74:04.739 --> 00:74:09.500
doing to fight the rise of fascism in Germany.

1214
00:74:09.759 --> 00:74:12.449
Um And I don't pretend I don't mean to be

1215
00:74:12.458 --> 00:74:15.338
judgmental. I'm sure people have all kinds of reasons

1216
00:74:15.350 --> 00:74:16.699
, et cetera, but I just had a very

1217
00:74:16.708 --> 00:74:21.069
clear sense very quickly that I needed my professional life

1218
00:74:21.079 --> 00:74:25.100
and my scholarship to reflect the time that I was

1219
00:74:25.109 --> 00:74:29.060
living in. And I had a, I wanted

1220
00:74:29.069 --> 00:74:30.890
to know who in my own country and in my

1221
00:74:30.899 --> 00:74:34.159
own history. Um I could turn to as an

1222
00:74:34.168 --> 00:74:39.458
example of someone who had faced a moral emergency in

1223
00:74:39.628 --> 00:74:42.859
their country. Head on. And I just decided

1224
00:74:42.869 --> 00:74:44.520
I wanted to turn to women. I'd spent 20

1225
00:74:44.529 --> 00:74:47.069
years of my career really exclusively focusing on men.

1226
00:74:47.079 --> 00:74:51.609
And so I, I asked myself to fight something

1227
00:74:51.619 --> 00:74:57.409
as entrenched as enslavement was in the United States in

1228
00:74:57.418 --> 00:75:00.770
the 19th century. I just thought you'd have to

1229
00:75:00.779 --> 00:75:03.369
be thinking philosophically, you'd have to be asking big

1230
00:75:03.378 --> 00:75:09.088
questions like, what is equality, what is justice

1231
00:75:09.100 --> 00:75:11.009
? What does it mean to be a human?

1232
00:75:11.298 --> 00:75:15.449
What is moral obligation? Um So I went to

1233
00:75:15.458 --> 00:75:18.529
an archive associated with Harvard and that, that is

1234
00:75:18.539 --> 00:75:21.079
a, a library and an archive specifically about women

1235
00:75:21.088 --> 00:75:25.918
and asked if they knew of any women with a

1236
00:75:25.930 --> 00:75:30.899
kind of philosophical uh trajectory who had been involved in

1237
00:75:30.909 --> 00:75:33.319
abolitionism and they didn't. But they gave me a

1238
00:75:33.329 --> 00:75:38.588
box of letters that included a letter by this woman

1239
00:75:38.600 --> 00:75:41.708
who I'd never heard of, but um was immediately

1240
00:75:41.720 --> 00:75:45.659
just transfixed by her moral vision, her ability to

1241
00:75:45.668 --> 00:75:51.369
argue philosophically um and her ability to dedicate her life

1242
00:75:51.378 --> 00:75:57.838
to ending entrenched evil in her country. So I

1243
00:75:57.850 --> 00:76:00.189
decided to pivot towards doing something about her. And

1244
00:76:00.199 --> 00:76:02.239
at first I, I did write a couple of

1245
00:76:02.250 --> 00:76:05.789
more academic articles about her. She was definitely a

1246
00:76:05.798 --> 00:76:09.918
philosophical thinker. She also talked about philosophy. She

1247
00:76:09.930 --> 00:76:13.949
read philosophy, she was very influenced by German philosophy

1248
00:76:14.319 --> 00:76:17.208
. Um She regularly cites Schiller and Goethe and Harrier

1249
00:76:17.720 --> 00:76:20.708
and John Paul. She mentions Kant, she mentions

1250
00:76:20.720 --> 00:76:25.039
Hegel. German philosophy was very popular in the United

1251
00:76:25.048 --> 00:76:27.699
States. Um, in the 18 thirties and forties

1252
00:76:27.708 --> 00:76:29.958
when she started writing. So I had a lot

1253
00:76:29.970 --> 00:76:35.009
of pretty instant connections to her philosophical thinking. But

1254
00:76:35.020 --> 00:76:39.509
what really again got my attention was she wrote a

1255
00:76:39.520 --> 00:76:43.060
book in 18 33 and that's almost three decades before

1256
00:76:43.069 --> 00:76:45.579
the American Civil War started. So in 18 33

1257
00:76:45.588 --> 00:76:49.430
he wrote a book called An Appeal in Favor of

1258
00:76:49.439 --> 00:76:54.869
that class of Americans called Africans. And this,

1259
00:76:54.878 --> 00:77:00.890
this is just a fire hose of arguments denouncing all

1260
00:77:00.899 --> 00:77:05.069
of the bad arguments that Americans had been using to

1261
00:77:05.079 --> 00:77:10.390
justify slavery. And I was so impressed by how

1262
00:77:10.399 --> 00:77:13.680
she, I think her general philosophical commitment was to

1263
00:77:13.689 --> 00:77:17.378
thinking that humans are basically good, but they're susceptible

1264
00:77:17.390 --> 00:77:21.009
to bad arguments that appeal to their selfishness, their

1265
00:77:21.020 --> 00:77:24.859
self interest, their vanity. And if you can

1266
00:77:24.869 --> 00:77:29.649
just clear away those arguments, you can really get

1267
00:77:29.659 --> 00:77:31.180
them to reform. I'm not sure she was right

1268
00:77:31.189 --> 00:77:33.899
about that. I don't even think she thought she

1269
00:77:33.909 --> 00:77:36.088
was right about that by the end of her life

1270
00:77:36.359 --> 00:77:41.279
. Um But I became really fascinated both by her

1271
00:77:41.289 --> 00:77:44.628
as a philosophical thinker, but also as a woman

1272
00:77:44.640 --> 00:77:48.430
whose life intersects in all of the major moments leading

1273
00:77:48.439 --> 00:77:53.560
up to and through the American Civil War. Um

1274
00:77:54.009 --> 00:77:58.829
She did everything from put her body between abolitionist speakers

1275
00:77:58.838 --> 00:78:02.725
and anti abolitionist mobs. She wrote fiction and also

1276
00:78:02.734 --> 00:78:08.154
argumentative essays. She wrote biographies, she wrote histories

1277
00:78:08.185 --> 00:78:11.824
. Um She volunteered herself raising money for and sewing

1278
00:78:11.833 --> 00:78:16.213
for both union soldiers and, um, enslaved peoples

1279
00:78:16.225 --> 00:78:19.479
. So she, um, she was, she

1280
00:78:19.489 --> 00:78:21.819
is, to me a real example of someone who

1281
00:78:21.829 --> 00:78:28.020
took her role as an American citizen seriously and deployed

1282
00:78:28.029 --> 00:78:30.458
everything she could think of, uh, to address

1283
00:78:30.470 --> 00:78:33.699
what she saw as the great moral crisis in her

1284
00:78:33.708 --> 00:78:35.939
country. So I wrote a biography of her.

1285
00:78:35.949 --> 00:78:39.159
Um, again, I, I thought I would

1286
00:78:39.168 --> 00:78:41.899
just sort of write academic articles about her, but

1287
00:78:42.199 --> 00:78:45.378
the story is so compelling that I ended up writing

1288
00:78:45.390 --> 00:78:46.819
the whole thing and that came out um about six

1289
00:78:46.829 --> 00:78:50.279
months ago. Great. Uh And II, I

1290
00:78:50.289 --> 00:78:54.869
mean, uh we also have to keep in mind

1291
00:78:54.878 --> 00:79:00.000
that the 19th century was not to, to put

1292
00:79:00.009 --> 00:79:04.949
it mildly very women friendly and also for the most

1293
00:79:04.958 --> 00:79:10.810
part, not very friendly to any person who was

1294
00:79:10.819 --> 00:79:15.329
not of European descent, basically in, in terms

1295
00:79:15.338 --> 00:79:19.750
of the mainstream philosophers, thinkers, scientists and so

1296
00:79:19.759 --> 00:79:21.600
on. Uh I mean, of course, we

1297
00:79:21.609 --> 00:79:26.720
have to keep also in mind the cultural context back

1298
00:79:26.729 --> 00:79:29.140
then. And I, I'm also not one of

1299
00:79:29.149 --> 00:79:30.779
those people who, of course, I say that

1300
00:79:30.789 --> 00:79:33.989
that they were wrong in terms of their sexism and

1301
00:79:34.000 --> 00:79:38.329
racism. But I don't think that if I lived

1302
00:79:38.338 --> 00:79:43.189
back then I wouldn't have been racist and sexist myself

1303
00:79:43.199 --> 00:79:45.949
, of course, very likely I would have been

1304
00:79:45.958 --> 00:79:48.708
one as well and most of us, I guess

1305
00:79:48.720 --> 00:79:51.399
so. Uh But I mean, we have to

1306
00:79:51.489 --> 00:79:56.079
keep that, keep that in mind but also the

1307
00:79:56.088 --> 00:80:00.539
struggle that women and, uh, but, uh

1308
00:80:00.548 --> 00:80:05.689
African Americans and other minorities went through and particularly since

1309
00:80:05.869 --> 00:80:10.859
we are approaching things here from a philosophical perspective and

1310
00:80:10.869 --> 00:80:14.409
I am talking with U as an academic, I

1311
00:80:14.418 --> 00:80:17.918
mean, it's historically, it's a fact and even

1312
00:80:17.930 --> 00:80:23.529
con temporarily that, uh, women and, uh

1313
00:80:23.539 --> 00:80:26.850
, other minorities, uh, I mean, their

1314
00:80:26.859 --> 00:80:32.579
work has very much been neglected, sometimes suppressed and

1315
00:80:33.079 --> 00:80:34.770
, uh, stuff like that. Right. So

1316
00:80:34.779 --> 00:80:39.279
, it's, it's not been easy at all for

1317
00:80:39.449 --> 00:80:46.088
people who are not European white males and European white

1318
00:80:46.100 --> 00:80:49.798
males, particularly from the upper classes to have their

1319
00:80:49.810 --> 00:80:53.750
voices heard. Yeah. Yeah. And, and

1320
00:80:53.759 --> 00:80:57.319
there's really wonderful work being done on that. So

1321
00:80:57.329 --> 00:81:00.588
, um Kristen Yah and Dal and Nassar just last

1322
00:81:00.600 --> 00:81:03.939
year published a whole anthology of work by women philosophers

1323
00:81:03.949 --> 00:81:08.270
in Germany in the 19th century. And Alison Stone

1324
00:81:08.279 --> 00:81:11.060
and I are working on a handbook about British and

1325
00:81:11.069 --> 00:81:14.520
American women philosophers in the 19th century. There were

1326
00:81:14.529 --> 00:81:16.899
many more of them than we think there were.

1327
00:81:17.229 --> 00:81:20.619
And they were often much better known than we think

1328
00:81:20.628 --> 00:81:24.529
they were. So, what we're talking about is

1329
00:81:24.539 --> 00:81:26.619
a combination of, of course, women didn't have

1330
00:81:26.628 --> 00:81:30.039
the same opportunities as men as far as education goes

1331
00:81:30.048 --> 00:81:32.140
. But they, but even those who manage to

1332
00:81:32.149 --> 00:81:39.859
philosophize despite that were pretty actively repressed and forgotten later

1333
00:81:39.869 --> 00:81:42.199
, like not in their lifetimes but later. So

1334
00:81:42.350 --> 00:81:44.029
, so there's a lot of really interesting work on

1335
00:81:44.039 --> 00:81:46.699
that. Um that I I feel very passionate about

1336
00:81:46.829 --> 00:81:48.270
. And I, I also think to your other

1337
00:81:48.279 --> 00:81:51.979
point, it's really important for us to acknowledge in

1338
00:81:51.989 --> 00:81:58.180
as much detail as we can the damage that people

1339
00:81:58.189 --> 00:82:00.180
like Hagel did on these topics. So I think

1340
00:82:00.189 --> 00:82:02.609
even myself as a woman, I used to just

1341
00:82:02.619 --> 00:82:03.930
sort of think, well, of course, he

1342
00:82:03.939 --> 00:82:08.640
thought women were like plants like everybody did, but

1343
00:82:08.649 --> 00:82:11.239
that's not true. There were lots of people including

1344
00:82:11.250 --> 00:82:13.338
women who didn't think that, but there were,

1345
00:82:13.350 --> 00:82:16.779
he did have options available to him and even more

1346
00:82:16.789 --> 00:82:19.619
so on race. So there's a, there's really

1347
00:82:19.628 --> 00:82:25.789
important work by Daniel James and Franz Kopek and um

1348
00:82:26.449 --> 00:82:29.939
and, and others on what Hagel probably did know

1349
00:82:29.970 --> 00:82:32.439
about other ways of thinking about non European peoples which

1350
00:82:32.449 --> 00:82:36.899
he deliberately chose to ignore or suppress. And there's

1351
00:82:36.909 --> 00:82:42.409
even terrible stories about Hagel. Hagel's like philosophy of

1352
00:82:42.418 --> 00:82:46.079
history being used as a justification in the United States

1353
00:82:46.088 --> 00:82:49.199
for perpetuating slavery. And, you know, I

1354
00:82:49.208 --> 00:82:55.140
was talking earlier about Hagel's ability to pinpoint hypocrisies um

1355
00:82:55.149 --> 00:82:57.449
between in a culture that said on the one hand

1356
00:82:57.458 --> 00:82:59.958
, all humans are worthy of dignity and respect.

1357
00:82:59.970 --> 00:83:02.100
And on the other hand, subjecting them to capitalism's

1358
00:83:02.109 --> 00:83:06.949
woes. Obviously, Hagel himself is horrendously guilty of

1359
00:83:06.958 --> 00:83:12.140
doing that pretty much with anyone who wasn't, as

1360
00:83:12.149 --> 00:83:15.418
you said, an upper class white European male.

1361
00:83:15.560 --> 00:83:18.600
Um And I have become much less willing just to

1362
00:83:18.609 --> 00:83:20.449
say, wow, OK, that's like a part

1363
00:83:20.458 --> 00:83:23.939
of his philosophy, we can ignore um and much

1364
00:83:23.949 --> 00:83:27.259
more determined to take that head on and, and

1365
00:83:27.270 --> 00:83:30.329
as you say, too importantly, augmented with a

1366
00:83:30.338 --> 00:83:34.640
kind of humility that reminds myself as well, that

1367
00:83:34.649 --> 00:83:38.430
I'm probably on the wrong side of history on other

1368
00:83:38.439 --> 00:83:41.259
things. And that, um if I were living

1369
00:83:41.270 --> 00:83:43.479
at Hegel's time, I probably would have had many

1370
00:83:43.489 --> 00:83:45.859
opinions that were not very enlightened either. So,

1371
00:83:45.869 --> 00:83:47.619
to me, that's part of the, the general

1372
00:83:47.628 --> 00:83:51.279
project of thinking about the 19th century is elevating voices

1373
00:83:51.289 --> 00:83:57.338
like childs that are um so philosophical and so resonant

1374
00:83:57.350 --> 00:84:00.369
and using the same kinds of ideas, including ideas

1375
00:84:00.378 --> 00:84:03.430
about art that Hagel was interested in, but really

1376
00:84:03.439 --> 00:84:06.640
in the service of good and trying to be much

1377
00:84:06.649 --> 00:84:11.680
more mindful and critical of ways in which Hegel's philosophy

1378
00:84:11.689 --> 00:84:15.180
is beautiful and compelling as it can be um was

1379
00:84:15.189 --> 00:84:17.259
used for evil. Yeah. Uh I mean,

1380
00:84:17.270 --> 00:84:20.838
this is another entire discussion that I think is very

1381
00:84:20.850 --> 00:84:24.220
interesting that people can have. I mean, uh

1382
00:84:24.229 --> 00:84:26.689
and the same applies to artists. I mean,

1383
00:84:26.699 --> 00:84:30.789
sometimes people discuss if what we should do with the

1384
00:84:30.798 --> 00:84:33.994
work of immoral artists, if we should ban it

1385
00:84:34.003 --> 00:84:36.654
, if not, if we, if we don't

1386
00:84:36.664 --> 00:84:40.753
ban it, uh we should analyze it. Uh

1387
00:84:40.765 --> 00:84:44.055
We should think of it if we should appreciate it

1388
00:84:44.064 --> 00:84:46.625
or not and if we should criticize it, uh

1389
00:84:46.634 --> 00:84:50.064
I mean, there's uh an immensity of questions out

1390
00:84:50.074 --> 00:84:53.939
there that are very interesting about that. But,

1391
00:84:53.949 --> 00:84:56.949
but uh uh I mean, of course, Uh

1392
00:84:57.149 --> 00:84:59.789
I'm not myself and I don't think you are some

1393
00:84:59.798 --> 00:85:02.310
of those people. I think that perhaps we should

1394
00:85:02.319 --> 00:85:05.869
be because someone in the 19th century or the 18th

1395
00:85:05.944 --> 00:85:12.404
century had some appalling views on women and uh black

1396
00:85:12.414 --> 00:85:15.574
people and other minorities that we should just, uh

1397
00:85:16.034 --> 00:85:19.984
, I completely ignore or think that the rest of

1398
00:85:19.994 --> 00:85:26.744
their work is, doesn't have any intellectual valid validity

1399
00:85:26.753 --> 00:85:30.289
at all. But, uh yeah, it's very

1400
00:85:30.298 --> 00:85:36.180
much a well established fact that all of the people

1401
00:85:36.189 --> 00:85:41.369
we talked about in German philosophy in the 19th century

1402
00:85:41.378 --> 00:85:45.409
and Kent was mostly from the 18th century and,

1403
00:85:45.689 --> 00:85:48.029
and others like them. Uh I, I mean

1404
00:85:48.039 --> 00:85:50.329
, I, I it, it's interesting that even

1405
00:85:50.338 --> 00:85:56.069
Kent was talking about universal values but apparently they didn't

1406
00:85:56.079 --> 00:86:02.789
apply to uh non European people uh curiously enough.

1407
00:86:02.798 --> 00:86:04.750
But, but I, I mean, the same

1408
00:86:04.759 --> 00:86:09.088
thing I guess happened in other sorts of instances,

1409
00:86:09.100 --> 00:86:12.390
like, for example, you have the French revolution

1410
00:86:12.399 --> 00:86:17.189
and supposedly everyone should get a vote, everyone should

1411
00:86:17.199 --> 00:86:23.100
get the same. But it was just very gradually

1412
00:86:23.109 --> 00:86:27.829
that the population in France, uh the adult population

1413
00:86:27.979 --> 00:86:31.000
got to AAA right to vote. I mean,

1414
00:86:31.009 --> 00:86:35.378
first it was just uh one slice of the male

1415
00:86:35.390 --> 00:86:39.739
population and then, and the same in happened in

1416
00:86:39.750 --> 00:86:42.430
America, I think, I think that initially it

1417
00:86:42.439 --> 00:86:45.239
was just the, the people who, who owned

1418
00:86:45.250 --> 00:86:48.939
land, I guess whether the right to vote and

1419
00:86:48.949 --> 00:86:50.668
then it was, yeah, all of that was

1420
00:86:50.680 --> 00:86:53.708
in flux. For a very long time here.

1421
00:86:53.720 --> 00:86:55.529
That's true. And, and the other thing to

1422
00:86:55.539 --> 00:86:56.970
bring up, I think in the context of the

1423
00:86:56.979 --> 00:87:00.449
French revolution is the Haitian revolution. And the fact

1424
00:87:00.458 --> 00:87:03.128
that France absolutely did not want any of their revolutionary

1425
00:87:03.140 --> 00:87:05.909
principles to apply to a part of the world that

1426
00:87:05.918 --> 00:87:10.850
was primarily inhabited by Black people. Um So that

1427
00:87:10.859 --> 00:87:13.989
, that's another classic case of um of the kind

1428
00:87:14.000 --> 00:87:16.009
of hypocrisy that I think you're right. To me

1429
00:87:16.020 --> 00:87:20.449
, it just feels increasingly important to acknowledge those problems

1430
00:87:20.458 --> 00:87:24.949
always and upfront. And in every part of our

1431
00:87:24.958 --> 00:87:29.128
discussion of these earlier thinkers, um and never to

1432
00:87:29.140 --> 00:87:30.850
treat it as something we can just sort of mention

1433
00:87:30.859 --> 00:87:32.708
on the side and then move on from. Um

1434
00:87:32.720 --> 00:87:36.250
But I don't think that ignoring these people is good

1435
00:87:36.259 --> 00:87:40.789
either because it's important for us to remember that even

1436
00:87:40.798 --> 00:87:45.399
people who were intelligent and progressive in other ways um

1437
00:87:45.409 --> 00:87:48.039
could make really horrendous mistakes. And I, and

1438
00:87:48.048 --> 00:87:50.680
I guess that I it's not only important from a

1439
00:87:50.689 --> 00:87:57.588
sort of ethical standpoint but also intellectually speaking, I

1440
00:87:57.600 --> 00:88:02.918
guess it's enriching uh to uh have a better understanding

1441
00:88:02.930 --> 00:88:10.048
of how our socio cultural context can influence and have

1442
00:88:10.060 --> 00:88:15.279
an impact on our intellectual work, I guess.

1443
00:88:15.329 --> 00:88:16.439
Absolutely. Yeah, we, we need to understand

1444
00:88:16.449 --> 00:88:21.140
why we think what we think and understanding thinkers that

1445
00:88:21.149 --> 00:88:25.168
came before us is an indispensable part of that for

1446
00:88:25.180 --> 00:88:29.180
sure. A a and also keeping in keeping in

1447
00:88:29.189 --> 00:88:32.909
mind that again, people are not disembodied beings and

1448
00:88:32.918 --> 00:88:36.819
we live and we not only have a body but

1449
00:88:36.829 --> 00:88:41.939
we also live in a particular society in a particular

1450
00:88:41.949 --> 00:88:45.588
period of time, in a particular culture, we

1451
00:88:45.600 --> 00:88:48.159
have a ton of different in influences and we are

1452
00:88:48.168 --> 00:88:53.609
also products of all of that even intellectually. It's

1453
00:88:53.619 --> 00:88:59.439
not that we have some sort of reasoning faculty that

1454
00:88:59.449 --> 00:89:02.708
, that is impermeable to all of that and that

1455
00:89:02.720 --> 00:89:08.449
allow us to get some sort of glimpse into objective

1456
00:89:08.458 --> 00:89:11.689
reality as it is. Yeah. And I,

1457
00:89:11.699 --> 00:89:13.819
I'll also just say briefly, that's one of the

1458
00:89:13.829 --> 00:89:17.628
things that really fascinates me about child is that she

1459
00:89:17.640 --> 00:89:24.029
was able in many ways to transcend and to see

1460
00:89:24.039 --> 00:89:28.239
beyond what was absolutely the norm around her. And

1461
00:89:28.250 --> 00:89:30.378
I'm really fascinated by that. Um And I,

1462
00:89:30.970 --> 00:89:33.079
you know, most of your viewers will know that

1463
00:89:33.088 --> 00:89:35.039
. Um So she grew up in Boston, which

1464
00:89:35.048 --> 00:89:41.789
is in the north and most northerners now assume that

1465
00:89:41.798 --> 00:89:45.208
all northerners then were against slavery. And that's absolutely

1466
00:89:45.220 --> 00:89:49.909
not true. Absolutely not true. Many northerners actively

1467
00:89:49.918 --> 00:89:54.600
resisted the end of slavery in the South. So

1468
00:89:54.609 --> 00:89:58.378
she was surrounded by politicians and educators and journalists and

1469
00:89:58.390 --> 00:90:02.039
religious leaders who actively preached that this was an acceptable

1470
00:90:02.048 --> 00:90:05.699
way for society to be organized. And somehow she

1471
00:90:05.708 --> 00:90:08.009
saw beyond it. And she, you know,

1472
00:90:08.020 --> 00:90:10.069
she wasn't alone in that. And I'll also say

1473
00:90:11.009 --> 00:90:13.109
part of how she knew this is she actually talked

1474
00:90:13.119 --> 00:90:15.989
to black people, right? So she actually listened

1475
00:90:15.000 --> 00:90:18.298
to the people who were themselves affected. And once

1476
00:90:18.310 --> 00:90:20.149
was able to see it from their point of view

1477
00:90:20.159 --> 00:90:25.128
, realized that what she was hearing from the leaders

1478
00:90:25.140 --> 00:90:28.189
in her society was, was wrong. So again

1479
00:90:28.199 --> 00:90:29.890
, I don't mean to suggest that she had some

1480
00:90:29.899 --> 00:90:31.668
sort of, as you say, disembodied um experience

1481
00:90:31.680 --> 00:90:34.399
, but she was willing to listen in a way

1482
00:90:34.409 --> 00:90:38.668
that I take as an inspiration to those of us

1483
00:90:38.680 --> 00:90:42.619
who sometimes it's a kind of occupational hazard for philosophers

1484
00:90:42.628 --> 00:90:44.770
. We like to look at things from very high

1485
00:90:44.779 --> 00:90:46.109
up. And often I think it takes more of

1486
00:90:46.119 --> 00:90:50.208
a listening on the ground to um get real ethical

1487
00:90:50.220 --> 00:90:54.100
insight into what needs to happen next. By the

1488
00:90:54.109 --> 00:90:57.180
way, at least back in her time, how

1489
00:90:57.189 --> 00:91:01.279
influential was her, I mean, in the philosophical

1490
00:91:01.289 --> 00:91:06.259
world and more specifically in the abolitionist movement in the

1491
00:91:06.270 --> 00:91:10.739
US, she was very influential. She, she

1492
00:91:10.750 --> 00:91:14.298
was one of the most famous abolitionists um of the

1493
00:91:14.310 --> 00:91:16.180
19th century. And, and part of what's so

1494
00:91:16.189 --> 00:91:19.029
interesting about her is that she was famous before.

1495
00:91:19.039 --> 00:91:25.180
She became an abolitionist because she um almost unheard of

1496
00:91:25.189 --> 00:91:29.369
in the American 19th century by the age of 22

1497
00:91:30.048 --> 00:91:30.418
which would have been, you know, in the

1498
00:91:30.520 --> 00:91:34.430
mid 18 twenties, was a very well known novelist

1499
00:91:34.439 --> 00:91:38.930
and a self sufficient female author. And she'd written

1500
00:91:38.939 --> 00:91:41.958
a couple novels and a couple of self-help books,

1501
00:91:42.298 --> 00:91:45.750
um like cooking books or books about parenting or housekeeping

1502
00:91:46.109 --> 00:91:49.680
um that had made her really beloved and trusted along

1503
00:91:49.689 --> 00:91:51.838
among a great swath. I mean, she was

1504
00:91:51.850 --> 00:91:56.850
the 19th century equivalent of a household name. Um

1505
00:91:56.859 --> 00:91:59.890
And when she became an abolitionist, that was so

1506
00:91:59.899 --> 00:92:01.770
upsetting to her readers because it really meant that she

1507
00:92:01.779 --> 00:92:04.890
was a radical because to be, to be an

1508
00:92:04.899 --> 00:92:08.890
abolitionist in the 18 twenties and thirties in the United

1509
00:92:08.899 --> 00:92:12.979
States was to argue for the immediate end of slavery

1510
00:92:12.989 --> 00:92:16.789
without compensation to enslavers and most Americans in the North

1511
00:92:16.798 --> 00:92:20.418
and the South thought that that was just unthinkably radical

1512
00:92:20.708 --> 00:92:25.338
. Um But she, that's what she was convinced

1513
00:92:25.350 --> 00:92:26.829
. And, you know, by the time she

1514
00:92:26.838 --> 00:92:30.069
was about 30 she continued to be one of the

1515
00:92:30.079 --> 00:92:33.729
best published and most um public facing intellectuals of the

1516
00:92:33.739 --> 00:92:38.009
19th century. And certainly in the abolitionist movement as

1517
00:92:38.020 --> 00:92:40.708
far as her involvement in the philosophical community, it's

1518
00:92:40.720 --> 00:92:43.359
interesting, I mean, there wasn't so much like

1519
00:92:43.369 --> 00:92:47.930
philosophical tradition in the United States except really for the

1520
00:92:47.939 --> 00:92:51.979
one that was getting going again in Boston around Ralph

1521
00:92:51.989 --> 00:92:56.039
Waldo Emerson. And they did know each other.

1522
00:92:56.048 --> 00:93:00.520
They were almost exact contemporaries and she was admiring and

1523
00:93:00.529 --> 00:93:02.189
would go to his lectures. Um But also was

1524
00:93:02.199 --> 00:93:08.088
always concerned that he was allowing the abstraction of his

1525
00:93:08.100 --> 00:93:11.649
thought to distract him from what she thought he should

1526
00:93:11.659 --> 00:93:15.060
be doing, which was fighting slavery. So she'd

1527
00:93:15.069 --> 00:93:16.829
sometimes say he has a platform big enough and a

1528
00:93:16.838 --> 00:93:21.489
mind capacious enough really to make arguments against slavery and

1529
00:93:21.500 --> 00:93:26.489
he's not doing it. Um Emerson did come around

1530
00:93:26.500 --> 00:93:30.189
to doing that but only in 18 59 when John

1531
00:93:30.199 --> 00:93:34.628
Brown's failed insurrection in Virginia uh convinced him that slavery

1532
00:93:34.640 --> 00:93:38.918
needed to be um opposed. So she, she

1533
00:93:38.930 --> 00:93:41.789
certainly knew all of the philosophers in the Boston area

1534
00:93:41.798 --> 00:93:44.560
of her time and socialized with them, communicated with

1535
00:93:44.569 --> 00:93:46.609
them, but I think she feared that they had

1536
00:93:46.619 --> 00:93:50.020
disengaged themselves from the moral topics of their day.

1537
00:93:50.029 --> 00:93:54.909
Too much. OK. So uh I, I'm

1538
00:93:54.918 --> 00:93:57.680
also getting mindful of your time now. So let

1539
00:93:57.689 --> 00:94:00.390
me ask you, let me ask you one last

1540
00:94:00.399 --> 00:94:02.069
question. Uh And let me see if, if

1541
00:94:02.079 --> 00:94:05.930
I can phrase this correctly. So, uh and

1542
00:94:05.939 --> 00:94:10.060
be clear about it. Uh So, uh I

1543
00:94:10.069 --> 00:94:15.979
mean, there are some parts of philosophy that are

1544
00:94:15.989 --> 00:94:18.779
politically motivated, like for example, abolitionism is a

1545
00:94:18.789 --> 00:94:24.949
very clear example of that. And there are people

1546
00:94:24.958 --> 00:94:30.060
that tend to be a little bit dismissive of philosophy

1547
00:94:30.069 --> 00:94:35.140
that is done while politically motivated. And usually those

1548
00:94:35.149 --> 00:94:41.970
people from come from political positions that are opposite to

1549
00:94:41.979 --> 00:94:45.159
the, to the ones that they say are not

1550
00:94:45.168 --> 00:94:47.890
valid philosophy, of course. So the question I

1551
00:94:47.899 --> 00:94:51.659
wanted to ask you then is how do you look

1552
00:94:51.668 --> 00:94:58.579
at the place of a movement like abolitionism uh in

1553
00:94:58.588 --> 00:95:04.378
the broader historical context of philosophy? And uh uh

1554
00:95:04.619 --> 00:95:08.500
I mean, when it comes to how people look

1555
00:95:08.509 --> 00:95:14.489
again at politically motivated philosophy, I mean, to

1556
00:95:14.500 --> 00:95:19.449
what extent do you think we should take it seriously

1557
00:95:19.458 --> 00:95:20.708
? And, I mean, what do you think

1558
00:95:20.720 --> 00:95:26.548
basically about those people's position, the positions that,

1559
00:95:26.899 --> 00:95:30.000
oh, I, I mean, philosophy should be

1560
00:95:30.100 --> 00:95:33.810
about, I don't know people in academia. I

1561
00:95:33.819 --> 00:95:39.168
, I mean, it's, uh, transmitting knowledge

1562
00:95:39.180 --> 00:95:42.689
to students shouldn't be about, uh, turning them

1563
00:95:42.699 --> 00:95:45.970
into activists or something like that. So, uh

1564
00:95:45.979 --> 00:95:47.708
, I, I mean, I, I hope

1565
00:95:47.720 --> 00:95:50.970
I'm being clear in terms of the question I'm asking

1566
00:95:50.979 --> 00:95:54.079
here. But what are your thoughts on it?

1567
00:95:54.430 --> 00:95:56.439
Yeah, thank you. It's such a, it's

1568
00:95:56.449 --> 00:95:58.989
such an important question to me uh now, so

1569
00:95:59.000 --> 00:96:01.079
I appreciate the chance to think about it. Um

1570
00:96:02.329 --> 00:96:05.750
I guess a couple of things, first of all

1571
00:96:05.759 --> 00:96:11.390
, philosophy has not always been removed from reality.

1572
00:96:11.399 --> 00:96:15.100
And I think like the story of the 19th century

1573
00:96:15.109 --> 00:96:20.220
into the 20th century uh is much more about philosophy

1574
00:96:20.229 --> 00:96:27.509
deciding to extract itself from practice. And there are

1575
00:96:27.520 --> 00:96:31.088
historical reasons for that, but I think we're wrong

1576
00:96:31.100 --> 00:96:33.529
if we assume and I this isn't what you were

1577
00:96:33.539 --> 00:96:35.409
saying either. But I think some of the people

1578
00:96:35.418 --> 00:96:39.069
you're thinking about would say this, that, that

1579
00:96:39.079 --> 00:96:44.168
real philosophy shouldn't dirty its hands or shouldn't kind of

1580
00:96:44.180 --> 00:96:46.338
get involved in the world because then it's not as

1581
00:96:46.350 --> 00:96:50.020
pure, that's, that's a choice that philosophy has

1582
00:96:50.029 --> 00:96:56.029
made relatively recently as a discipline and it has to

1583
00:96:56.039 --> 00:97:00.338
do with the professionalization of philosophy um in the 19th

1584
00:97:00.350 --> 00:97:01.430
century, in the United States. Well, the

1585
00:97:01.439 --> 00:97:03.489
three cases I know most about are the US,

1586
00:97:03.500 --> 00:97:08.140
the UK and Germany, you, you couldn't get

1587
00:97:08.149 --> 00:97:11.418
a degree in philosophy no matter who you were in

1588
00:97:11.430 --> 00:97:13.548
for a long time. Right. Phd. S

1589
00:97:13.560 --> 00:97:15.649
weren't invented that long ago and even after they were

1590
00:97:15.659 --> 00:97:20.680
invented, they weren't necessary to philosophizing philosophical journals did

1591
00:97:20.689 --> 00:97:25.279
not use to require that you came from. Um

1592
00:97:25.390 --> 00:97:28.489
, you had a phd in philosophy to publish.

1593
00:97:28.500 --> 00:97:30.810
So, so the, the professionalization of philosophy has

1594
00:97:30.819 --> 00:97:33.189
meant that what it means to do philosophy has gotten

1595
00:97:33.199 --> 00:97:36.250
narrower and narrower and narrower, more elitist, more

1596
00:97:36.259 --> 00:97:41.350
professionalized. But there's a very long history of philosophy

1597
00:97:41.359 --> 00:97:45.850
being born out of grappling with the real world as

1598
00:97:45.859 --> 00:97:48.569
it were. Um And I don't think there's been

1599
00:97:48.579 --> 00:97:53.259
a social movement in history that hasn't required people to

1600
00:97:53.270 --> 00:97:56.588
think philosophically. Um I mean, Angela Davis is

1601
00:97:56.600 --> 00:97:59.798
a great example of someone who uh was doing a

1602
00:97:59.810 --> 00:98:02.890
phd in philosophy before she became an activist and brought

1603
00:98:02.899 --> 00:98:06.829
her um studies in Spinoza and Kant and Hegel to

1604
00:98:06.838 --> 00:98:11.470
her struggle for racial justice in the United States.

1605
00:98:11.708 --> 00:98:13.548
But I think pretty much anywhere you look, you

1606
00:98:13.560 --> 00:98:17.359
would find people who are fighting for justice thinking philosophically

1607
00:98:17.369 --> 00:98:19.729
. And I've been very happy to see people emphasizing

1608
00:98:19.739 --> 00:98:23.168
that more. So people are writing about Martin Luther

1609
00:98:23.180 --> 00:98:27.088
King as a philosopher for instance. Um And yeah

1610
00:98:27.100 --> 00:98:29.970
, I was going to say that perhaps another excellent

1611
00:98:29.979 --> 00:98:32.310
example would be the civil rights movement in the 19

1612
00:98:32.319 --> 00:98:35.189
sixties and seventies. Yeah, exactly. So,

1613
00:98:35.640 --> 00:98:40.509
so I think a, a more or an alternate

1614
00:98:40.520 --> 00:98:42.500
model and I think in some ways, a truer

1615
00:98:42.509 --> 00:98:46.180
model to philosophy's history is that when people are confronted

1616
00:98:46.189 --> 00:98:49.399
with injustices, they have to ask those bigger questions

1617
00:98:49.588 --> 00:98:51.949
. And I think what philosophy can do to empower

1618
00:98:51.958 --> 00:98:55.869
us is to give us some clarity about those questions

1619
00:98:56.140 --> 00:98:58.390
. So, you know, really what is justice

1620
00:98:58.399 --> 00:98:59.739
? Um you know, we can go back to

1621
00:98:59.750 --> 00:99:01.338
the Republic to find people trying to figure that out

1622
00:99:02.310 --> 00:99:04.930
. And so when I teach philosophy, I don't

1623
00:99:04.939 --> 00:99:08.699
at all think of myself as trying to turn my

1624
00:99:08.708 --> 00:99:11.539
students into activists. But I do think that I

1625
00:99:11.548 --> 00:99:14.720
want them to see that philosophy can be a really

1626
00:99:14.729 --> 00:99:19.989
powerful and even essential tool for understanding the terms of

1627
00:99:20.000 --> 00:99:23.699
our debates and the kinds of things we want to

1628
00:99:23.708 --> 00:99:27.659
fight for and then giving us the clarity of thought

1629
00:99:27.989 --> 00:99:30.739
that can motivate action. So when, when I

1630
00:99:30.750 --> 00:99:35.009
think about the way movements work, sometimes what happens

1631
00:99:35.020 --> 00:99:39.569
is people just aren't particularly clear what they're fighting for

1632
00:99:39.579 --> 00:99:42.159
and why and what that means is that whenever there's

1633
00:99:42.168 --> 00:99:44.838
infighting or tension or unclear, like you can just

1634
00:99:44.850 --> 00:99:46.579
lose focus and get, you know, distracted by

1635
00:99:46.588 --> 00:99:49.399
the details. But the better you are at saying

1636
00:99:49.409 --> 00:99:51.878
no, I thought this through philosophically, even if

1637
00:99:51.890 --> 00:99:55.100
you don't phrase it that way. This is what

1638
00:99:55.109 --> 00:99:58.970
is important, this is what back to Hagel really

1639
00:99:58.979 --> 00:100:01.939
creating a society in which people can truly be free

1640
00:100:01.970 --> 00:100:04.390
and not just abstractly free. This is what it

1641
00:100:04.399 --> 00:100:10.310
would look like that that is empowering and motivating in

1642
00:100:10.319 --> 00:100:12.430
a way that can help us stave off the kind

1643
00:100:12.439 --> 00:100:16.890
of burnout or fatalism that is all too often the

1644
00:100:16.899 --> 00:100:21.418
death of movements for justice. So I would prefer

1645
00:100:21.430 --> 00:100:25.378
to think philosophy is as something that is born out

1646
00:100:25.390 --> 00:100:29.168
of humans, just trying to figure our way out

1647
00:100:29.180 --> 00:100:30.600
in the world. And the more those of us

1648
00:100:30.609 --> 00:100:35.220
who are inclined to think philosophically can articulate those thoughts

1649
00:100:35.229 --> 00:100:38.798
and help people think them through. I think the

1650
00:100:38.810 --> 00:100:41.859
better chance philosophy has of actually fulfilling a good purpose

1651
00:100:41.869 --> 00:100:44.909
in the world. Yeah, a and perhaps,

1652
00:100:44.918 --> 00:100:49.009
I mean, people who might be worried uh about

1653
00:100:49.319 --> 00:100:56.100
keeping some of the philosophical traditions of the West,

1654
00:100:56.109 --> 00:101:00.838
perhaps they should also keep in mind that if Plato

1655
00:101:00.869 --> 00:101:05.140
is the father of Western philosophy, then he wrote

1656
00:101:05.149 --> 00:101:10.819
a book titled The Republic, which which I I

1657
00:101:10.829 --> 00:101:15.500
it would be very hard to argue that it's not

1658
00:101:15.548 --> 00:101:20.418
politically motivated because it's literally a book about how to

1659
00:101:20.430 --> 00:101:25.500
, to, to structure politically a society from top

1660
00:101:25.509 --> 00:101:28.100
to bottom. So, yeah, very good.

1661
00:101:28.229 --> 00:101:30.100
Yeah, absolutely. And the more I think we

1662
00:101:30.109 --> 00:101:34.899
recognize that philosophy has been done in many different ways

1663
00:101:35.060 --> 00:101:39.659
. So like the academic article really new, I

1664
00:101:39.668 --> 00:101:43.048
mean, we think about like Plato writing and dialogues

1665
00:101:43.060 --> 00:101:45.128
and Aristotle giving lectures and you know, k writing

1666
00:101:45.140 --> 00:101:48.838
something more that we recognize as philosophy, but people

1667
00:101:48.850 --> 00:101:54.069
writing philosophically through literature, Nietzsche through aphorisms, like

1668
00:101:54.338 --> 00:101:58.600
many of our most important philosophers have been really disruptive

1669
00:101:58.609 --> 00:102:01.789
of what people thought philosophy was. And so I

1670
00:102:01.798 --> 00:102:04.289
, I do not feel like my time is well

1671
00:102:04.298 --> 00:102:09.109
spent fighting for a version of philosophy that I think

1672
00:102:09.119 --> 00:102:13.680
is pretty historically contingent, sometimes harmful and not where

1673
00:102:13.689 --> 00:102:18.810
the real energy of philosophy should be great. So

1674
00:102:18.819 --> 00:102:23.489
, uh let's wrap up the interview here then uh

1675
00:102:23.500 --> 00:102:26.579
just before we go and by the way, I'm

1676
00:102:26.588 --> 00:102:29.250
also leaving a link in the description box to your

1677
00:102:29.259 --> 00:102:32.649
book Lydia on Lydia Maria Child. Uh and apart

1678
00:102:32.659 --> 00:102:34.970
from the book, would you like to tell people

1679
00:102:34.979 --> 00:102:38.270
where they can find you and your work on the

1680
00:102:38.279 --> 00:102:40.680
internet? Yes, thank you. I do have

1681
00:102:40.689 --> 00:102:43.579
a website which is just Lydia Moland dot com.

1682
00:102:43.588 --> 00:102:46.579
And I am also on Twitter. I think that's

1683
00:102:46.588 --> 00:102:53.548
Lydia underscore Moland and I have maybe two things on

1684
00:102:53.560 --> 00:102:57.009
Instagram. So I'm not, uh I'm not,

1685
00:102:57.020 --> 00:102:59.649
never been a big social media person. I'm getting

1686
00:102:59.659 --> 00:103:00.500
my dipping my toes in a little bit, but

1687
00:103:00.838 --> 00:103:03.029
um Twitter is where I post the most and I

1688
00:103:03.039 --> 00:103:05.729
do try to keep the website updated. So people

1689
00:103:05.739 --> 00:103:08.779
are more interested in in any of my writing.

1690
00:103:08.789 --> 00:103:10.979
Um All of my writing is listed on the website

1691
00:103:11.109 --> 00:103:13.329
and what I'm working on now is um findable on

1692
00:103:13.338 --> 00:103:15.338
Twitter. Ok, great. So, Doctor Molan

1693
00:103:15.350 --> 00:103:18.378
