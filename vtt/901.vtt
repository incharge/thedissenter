WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.490
Uh look, I, I was, I was

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.389
going to ask you because uh I think that in

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.078
one of our conversations, we talked a little bit

4
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.720
about this. But uh I was uh I was

5
00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:14.989
curious, I got curious the other day, um

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.829
when you're, when you're in the process in the

7
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:24.489
initial steps of creating a story, uh o of

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.859
course, I don't want you to just leave on

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.260
the table all your cards, all of the things

10
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.408
that you use as a, as a writer.

11
00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.630
I'm an open book but I'll talk about anything.

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.709
But uh uh uh how do you go about it

13
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.959
exactly. I mean, because of course, I

14
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.209
imagine that different writers, different artists have different methods

15
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.189
, different processes. They go through different creative ways

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.868
of uh building up their stories. But uh how

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.950
do you do it exactly? I mean, uh

18
00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.848
perhaps not so much how you do it but uh

19
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.870
how much of it do you plan ahead? So

20
00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.120
you, uh for example, you have an idea

21
00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:11.948
for a story before you start writing. Do you

22
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:18.239
already have a detailed plan about uh the characters that

23
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.088
you will have their, their personalities, their names

24
00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.698
the places where the story will take place, the

25
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.459
ending or how do you go about it? I

26
00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.680
used to not, first of all, what you're

27
00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.239
talking about is there are two kinds of writers,

28
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.409
they say plotters and panthers, plotters plot, right

29
00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:41.329
? And panthers fly by the seat of their pants

30
00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:42.659
. I used to be a panther and because I

31
00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:46.620
, I felt like, I don't know, II

32
00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:49.180
, I like that feeling of kind of winging it

33
00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.819
and seeing where the story took me. And then

34
00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.909
I, um I wrote an outline for one of

35
00:01:53.918 --> 00:01:57.969
my novels and by outline, I didn't kind of

36
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.799
, I didn't really write a classical outline. In

37
00:01:59.808 --> 00:02:01.269
fact, I didn't even start out trying to write

38
00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:06.019
an outline. I was just trying to think through

39
00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:07.980
, I knew I wanted to tell a certain story

40
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:10.490
and I was trying to think through how I would

41
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.599
get from one part of the story to the next

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.689
. And so what I began doing was um writing

43
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.250
a chapter, giving the chapter a name. I

44
00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:23.729
didn't always give the chapter a name first. Sometimes

45
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.860
I, I wrote a short summary of it first

46
00:02:25.868 --> 00:02:28.550
. I would just write a short summary, basically

47
00:02:28.558 --> 00:02:31.000
what I wanted to happen in that chapter. And

48
00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:37.069
so that's how I've settled on writing an outline that

49
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.189
to, to put it more into a narrative,

50
00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.879
you know, to put my outline into a,

51
00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.949
into prose, you know, into a, into

52
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.750
an actual functioning narrative works better for me than writing

53
00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.099
the, the sort of classical outline of, you

54
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.879
know, the chapter one a is going to happen

55
00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.770
, the protagonist meets the heroine, they go on

56
00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.479
a motorcycle ride, you know, that, that

57
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.979
doesn't work for me. It doesn't, it doesn't

58
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.240
inspire me sufficiently to wanna write to that direct,

59
00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:10.429
you know, to that chapter. So, you

60
00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.409
know, sometimes if I write a relatively short summary

61
00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.000
, that's maybe just a paragraph. Other times,

62
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:21.439
I even, you know, if I feel moved

63
00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.169
, I'll write an entire scene from that, you

64
00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.758
know, as it kind of comes to me,

65
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.740
not perfect obviously, but just maybe a few lines

66
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.758
of dialogue, whatever it is. And that has

67
00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:35.830
been really helpful to me. So now I think

68
00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:40.719
I'm an official plotter because I, um not only

69
00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:45.118
does that expedite the process tremendously, it, it

70
00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.118
just makes it so much easier to write. It

71
00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.830
also keeps somebody like me who is prone to creative

72
00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:57.808
tangents. It keeps me on the straight and narrow

73
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.050
and not, you know, taking the reader to

74
00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.288
a place they don't need to go and they don't

75
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.788
even really want to go, which is, you

76
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.338
know, kind of important. You, you have

77
00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.099
to keep your readers uh needs in mind. You

78
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.709
know, I think as a writer, I think

79
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.750
that's important, not just your own needs. It's

80
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.920
, it's, it's a conversation you're having in a

81
00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:25.199
sense with someone who is picking up your work and

82
00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:28.500
, and, and and you have to remember that

83
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.579
it's not one sided. Yeah. You know,

84
00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:33.319
I, I was curious about asking you about that

85
00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:35.980
. O of course, again, you're just one

86
00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:41.338
single creator. There are many different ways of doing

87
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.608
the same thing. I bet. So, but

88
00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:46.369
I, I was just thinking so for example,

89
00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.059
we've already talked here on the show about, for

90
00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.889
example, uh a game of Thrones, I mentioned

91
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:55.678
a few times one piece and I mean, I

92
00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.298
was just uh and the Lord of the Rings also

93
00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:00.238
, for example, uh I was just thinking about

94
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.838
uh when writers try to go about creating those massive

95
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.319
stories that go for more than 1000 chapters in manga

96
00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:17.838
or several different uh 1000 pages volumes uh book volumes

97
00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.730
. I was just thinking, how much ahead do

98
00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:28.678
they plan their story? Because sometimes the story flows

99
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.678
so well that one as a reader would think.

100
00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.689
Oh OK. So this guy before he started his

101
00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.819
story, he might have had uh II I don't

102
00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:46.199
know 1000 pages of detailed plot, plot lines or

103
00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:49.634
scenes that he would go through and he must have

104
00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:54.173
had everything planned from the start. But then you

105
00:05:54.182 --> 00:05:58.824
get to, I don't know the latest or what

106
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:01.903
will be the latest book by George RR Martin the

107
00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:04.153
Winds of winter. And he's been trying to write

108
00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:10.023
it since 2011 and he's just like stuck beca and

109
00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.444
, and then, and then when that something like

110
00:06:12.454 --> 00:06:15.764
that happens when the writer goes for 12 years without

111
00:06:15.773 --> 00:06:17.958
being able to, to finish the sixth book in

112
00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.966
the install the sixth installment in the series. You're

113
00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:24.007
like, oh, ok. So wait a minute

114
00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:27.247
, let's track back a little bit because this guy

115
00:06:27.257 --> 00:06:31.286
hasn't planned that far ahead because now he doesn't know

116
00:06:31.298 --> 00:06:34.507
what to do with so many plot lines and with

117
00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:38.887
so many different things happening at the same time in

118
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.827
the story. And then, you know, then

119
00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:47.221
sometimes readers read too much into something that came previously

120
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.391
in the story and, and then they expect it

121
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.790
to come back and a plot line and, and

122
00:06:53.802 --> 00:06:55.372
it was never intended to be that. Yeah.

123
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.420
And, and, and sometimes it's just, oh

124
00:06:57.432 --> 00:07:00.730
my God, these, these here two books ago

125
00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:03.502
was foreshadowing or, and it's not foreshadowing at all

126
00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:10.062
. It was just that they coincidentally uh brought to

127
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:14.574
the story, something that if you look back,

128
00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:17.536
it, it seems that 200 chapters ago there was

129
00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:21.514
foreshadowing for that, but it was not for shadowing

130
00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:25.175
at all. I'll tell you when I look at

131
00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:27.584
someone like George RR Martin, I'm sure that Game

132
00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:30.175
of Thrones, the TV series was both a blessing

133
00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:32.134
and a curse because something like that, it,

134
00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:38.295
it really does interrupt your story process and you don't

135
00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:43.738
, you don't want it to kind of absorb into

136
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.548
your vision for the story. But it does,

137
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:54.309
I think that um the same is probably true uh

138
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.709
for, for people who, um, for kind

139
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.338
of established people with an established voice in their writing

140
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.838
if they attempt to use a I for something more

141
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.559
than say an outline, um, because it's,

142
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.428
it, it, it begins to conflict with your

143
00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:11.689
own ideas, but it gives you ideas at the

144
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.399
same time, but then you kind of lose sight

145
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.759
of where you are. And I think that,

146
00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:20.178
that probably, I can't imagine that didn't have an

147
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:24.509
effect on him to watch them in my, you

148
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:28.829
know, in our opinion, badly finish up his

149
00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:31.699
series, right? And now there are all these

150
00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:35.500
expectations and he's probably got to do, you know

151
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.820
, the double work of, for one of,

152
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.058
I'm sure his work was interrupted by the series because

153
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.899
he had to attend to that. But then to

154
00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:48.460
extract himself from the conclusions that the series writers made

155
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:54.668
and also allow there to be perhaps time enough for

156
00:08:54.678 --> 00:09:01.070
fans of the television series to get unvested in the

157
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.558
way that the series writers um develop the characters and

158
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.330
end of the story so that they can invest in

159
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.639
what Martin is writing. Um That II, I

160
00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:16.879
mean, I can imagine that's a huge challenge.

161
00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.690
I mean, II, I know a lot of

162
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.519
people are so mad at him for not having come

163
00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:28.269
out with um with this latest uh you know,

164
00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:31.178
installment of Game of Thrones, but I completely understand

165
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.509
it and I, I think he's probably doing the

166
00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:35.879
right thing, taking his time about it because unless

167
00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.200
he was just so in the zone and could finish

168
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.119
it, despite the fact that he had this Blockbuster

169
00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:45.590
series going on, which, I mean, unless

170
00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:48.109
you're a hermit of a writer, how can you

171
00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:50.590
not be affected by that? Um, I think

172
00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:54.570
probably the more time he gives it the more,

173
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.599
um, hopefully, you know, readers will be

174
00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:01.308
willing to reinvest in his, uh, in his

175
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.580
vision for the story. I suspect he's gonna end

176
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.700
it quite differently than the way it ended, don't

177
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.090
you? I hope so. I really do.

178
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:13.960
I mean, I, I really don't see it

179
00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:16.469
going any other way. Um, because I mean

180
00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:18.969
, the way they ended, it was just so

181
00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:22.119
mind bogglingly television for God's sake, you know,

182
00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:26.668
I mean, it was just so it was so

183
00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:28.538
amateur AAA and you know what I like is,

184
00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:33.229
uh, when sometimes writers are really honest about how

185
00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:37.619
they do things and how things work because I've watched

186
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.428
a few months ago an interview with George Rrrr Martin

187
00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:46.440
and, uh, uh, the interviewers were asking

188
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.000
him. Oh, so you've, uh, did

189
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:52.119
you, have you seen that, um, that

190
00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:54.408
theory, uh, uh that was made by fans

191
00:10:54.418 --> 00:10:58.668
that's, uh, going around, uh, in

192
00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:01.719
the, on the internet about this or that,

193
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:03.599
or is something that happened in the book? The

194
00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:07.000
, uh does it have this or that meaning?

195
00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:09.741
And he was like, and he was like,

196
00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:11.621
look, you can do with my story, whatever

197
00:11:11.631 --> 00:11:15.893
you want, it doesn't bother me. But people

198
00:11:15.903 --> 00:11:18.422
are sometimes read too much into your own work.

199
00:11:18.432 --> 00:11:22.501
It's not that complex. The only thing I have

200
00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:24.903
in mind there was this simple thing. It's not

201
00:11:24.913 --> 00:11:30.182
like connecting 1000 different points in the story. It's

202
00:11:30.192 --> 00:11:33.375
nothing like that. It was as simple as this

203
00:11:33.384 --> 00:11:37.575
. And so, and he also says that there

204
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.846
are things for example, but his characters, for

205
00:11:39.855 --> 00:11:46.235
example, the color of someone's eyes or particular aspects

206
00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:50.934
of their personality or particular things that he mentions in

207
00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:52.466
the main story, but are, are not part

208
00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:54.575
of the main story. I mean, some of

209
00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:58.609
the background story to a Game of Thrones, for

210
00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:01.570
example, that he actually has to go and ask

211
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.529
other experts on his own books because he doesn't remember

212
00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:11.509
anymore. Ricardo. It's so true because I mean

213
00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:15.779
, I, you know, I, I write

214
00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:18.219
in usually in series form, at least like a

215
00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:20.259
loose series of, of, of, you know

216
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:22.009
, books, there might be a series of books

217
00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:26.178
that are in the same universe and my kids are

218
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.460
always kind of laughing at me because they'll see me

219
00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:30.719
like rereading my own books and they're like, why

220
00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:31.899
are you reading your own book? You know,

221
00:12:31.908 --> 00:12:35.029
like, because I don't remember what I wrote and

222
00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:37.109
I have to make sure that I have continuity.

223
00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:39.119
So I'm sitting there reading my own books, you

224
00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:41.960
know, taking notes going, oh my God,

225
00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:43.320
I completely forgot that I wrote that you know,

226
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.359
because you, do, you forget it the way

227
00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:48.359
you forget things in your own life and, you

228
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.558
know, a friend might be like, don't you

229
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.700
remember when we did Xy and Z and you're like

230
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.580
, no, I don't remember that at all.

231
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.320
When did that happen? You know, and,

232
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.219
and you know, to them, it was obviously

233
00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:00.979
kind of an, in a fairly important experience,

234
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.200
at least enough for them to remember what happened and

235
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.229
you're looking at them like, II, I got

236
00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:09.558
nothing, you know what I mean? But,

237
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.710
but, but it is, it's incredibly detailed work

238
00:13:11.719 --> 00:13:13.798
writing a series and, you know, unless the

239
00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:16.460
series is, is very simple, you know,

240
00:13:16.469 --> 00:13:22.558
and, and, but um ok, there's just

241
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.538
a lot going on, you're writing somebody's life and

242
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.729
sometimes the lives of multiple characters and it can,

243
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.668
it can, you can easily misremember what happened in

244
00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:41.489
your own story the same way you can, you

245
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.168
can, uh you know, have a false memory

246
00:13:43.178 --> 00:13:46.808
about something in your own life and um interpret a

247
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.759
whole series of events differently because you remember it differently

248
00:13:52.769 --> 00:13:56.379
than other people who are experiencing it. Yeah.

249
00:13:56.678 --> 00:14:00.440
But, but that's the thing because we, because

250
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.090
there are people who are able to create such good

251
00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:09.219
stories. We sort of tend to idolize them and

252
00:14:09.229 --> 00:14:11.619
think of them as being people who died with,

253
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:16.599
I don't know, 200 IQ and perfect memories and

254
00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:20.739
a big planners and they, they, and,

255
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.389
and like they are the, the, your book

256
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:26.889
in their head from the very beginning. But actually

257
00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.168
, uh, uh, uh, I, I

258
00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:31.509
mean, I've never wrote a book but I would

259
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:37.899
imagine that perhaps most of the time you're actually rereading

260
00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:43.259
and rewriting, for sure. I'm doing something right

261
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.849
now that I've never done before. Um, I'm

262
00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:50.739
writing a Cold War Detective. No, our series

263
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.178
, but I'm gonna finish the first. Uh,

264
00:14:52.678 --> 00:14:54.599
well, I'm gonna call it a season. It

265
00:14:54.609 --> 00:14:56.428
may never have more than one season, but I'm

266
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.139
kind of using television language for this because it,

267
00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.440
it, it seems appropriate for the way I'm structuring

268
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.359
it. I, I want to finish the entire

269
00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:07.580
first season which will be several books, not like

270
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.259
super thick books, like my breath series is thick

271
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.830
. It's, you know, it's historical fantasy.

272
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.099
So they're like, you know, 450 pages,

273
00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:18.349
whatever. Each, these are barely not, you

274
00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:20.849
know, they're, they're novels but they're Detective Noir

275
00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:24.090
. And so they're more in the style, you

276
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:24.750
know, well, obviously more in the style of

277
00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.168
, but also, you know, it's more of

278
00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:28.330
what you would expect from. Um, you know

279
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.250
, Dashiell Hammett and other noir writers. Um,

280
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.889
but I, what I'm gonna be interested to find

281
00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:46.239
out is if I prefer writing the books, one

282
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.529
at a time being able to sit on them for

283
00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:50.408
a while, think about it, then write the

284
00:15:50.418 --> 00:15:54.229
next book or to essentially write it like, you

285
00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:58.298
know, one big story, one big book um

286
00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:03.830
, but all at once, basically, you know

287
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.210
what I mean? All at once, write all

288
00:16:06.219 --> 00:16:08.269
these books at once. And, um, you

289
00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.109
know, my intention is, you know, I'm

290
00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.950
, I'm doing a little experiment here. My intention

291
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.058
is to, uh release them quickly and sequentially because

292
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.889
I'd like to see how that works. You know

293
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:26.940
, I'd like to see if, um, if

294
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.629
, uh, it becomes more, you know,

295
00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:33.129
if, if it becomes in inspiring motivating for a

296
00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:34.950
reader to just, you know, go through the

297
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.849
entire series at once this way with you kind of

298
00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:41.158
in real time as they're being, um as they're

299
00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:45.250
being introduced and launched. I'm, I'm rereading this

300
00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:48.340
, this book right now and I'm really just at

301
00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:52.330
the very beginning, but I'm, I'm, I'm

302
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.710
enjoying the experience a lot. It's called The Artist's

303
00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:56.840
Way by Julia Cameron. I mean, it's like

304
00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.048
30 years old. She was an ex-wife of Martin

305
00:17:00.058 --> 00:17:06.150
Scorsese and she's, she's kind of made, she's

306
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.348
a writer too, but she also made a second

307
00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:14.968
career basically out of um unlocking people's creativity. Yeah

308
00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.718
, kind of this, this sort of motivational style

309
00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:22.827
teacher. But um it, and, but somehow

310
00:17:22.837 --> 00:17:25.388
this was a book I never ended up reading,

311
00:17:25.398 --> 00:17:26.108
like, I, I love books, like Writing

312
00:17:26.118 --> 00:17:30.798
Down The Bones by um Natalie Goldberg. But um

313
00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:33.347
I, I'd never read the Artist's Way. And

314
00:17:33.358 --> 00:17:36.509
even though it's, it's probably the most, um

315
00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:37.469
it, it, it's the kind of book that

316
00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:40.529
I would most relate to because it does kind of

317
00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:44.890
take this, this spiritual approach to creativity and,

318
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.078
and, and, um that's something that's, you

319
00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:49.789
know, very much part of my personality makeup.

320
00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:56.539
But it, it kind of takes you through the

321
00:17:56.549 --> 00:18:00.900
process of sitting with a story and, and being

322
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:06.509
in a place where you can eavesdrop on the characters

323
00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:10.400
, which, uh you know, a lot of

324
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.180
it's that it's easy to get out of that place

325
00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:15.769
and to put a lot of pressure on yourself and

326
00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:15.910
be like, oh my God. Now I've got

327
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.818
to write this and I think that when you stop

328
00:18:18.828 --> 00:18:22.598
eavesdropping on your characters, you start putting, um

329
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:25.809
, kind of undue, focus on maybe the setting

330
00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:29.568
and you can write, you know, three pages

331
00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:32.489
of expo exposition, just sort of describing where people

332
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.328
are and you don't need three pages of that.

333
00:18:33.338 --> 00:18:36.910
You know, it's, it's usually not always.

334
00:18:37.088 --> 00:18:38.019
But, um, you know, you can really

335
00:18:38.338 --> 00:18:41.900
become tiresome for a reader if you're not, um

336
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.809
, in the zone, if that makes sense,

337
00:18:44.818 --> 00:18:47.650
you know, if you're not in a, in

338
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.400
a place where you're able to listen. Yeah.

339
00:18:51.858 --> 00:18:53.009
And I think being in that place where you're able

340
00:18:53.019 --> 00:18:57.709
to listen makes it, um, will make,

341
00:18:57.719 --> 00:19:02.588
it, makes it a lot more likely that,

342
00:19:02.598 --> 00:19:03.670
uh, you're also listening to the needs of the

343
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.410
reader, not just to your own needs. Mhm

344
00:19:08.358 --> 00:19:12.559
. But anyway, so I, I'm, I've

345
00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:17.160
started on this and I'm trying to get up earlier

346
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.309
in the morning. And read it before I start

347
00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:22.828
work rather than reading at night, which is my

348
00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:26.818
usual, um, mo, uh, because I

349
00:19:26.828 --> 00:19:29.848
just get so tired at night that I really can't

350
00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.309
make it past a couple of pages anyway and I

351
00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:36.449
just fall right, right asleep. Um, but

352
00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:37.660
it's interesting and it's, it's also, I started

353
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.809
reading it because I, um, I, I've

354
00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:44.828
started book coaching someone, a friend of mine who's

355
00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:47.578
wanted to write, uh who's a very good writer

356
00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:48.759
and a creative person, but who has never written

357
00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:51.618
a novel and has, and wants to write a

358
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.709
series, which the idea for her series is just

359
00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:56.709
terrific. So I'm really excited about it. It's

360
00:19:56.719 --> 00:20:00.989
been a lot of fun coaching her and, you

361
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.299
know, I've kind of book, coached people in

362
00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:06.959
piecemeal throughout the years, but it's something that I've

363
00:20:06.969 --> 00:20:11.368
never really wanted to commit to, um for one

364
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.809
because I have three kids at home and you really

365
00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:15.289
, you can only do so much. But it's

366
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:18.219
, it's, you know, it, it sort

367
00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:21.229
of came at the right time because I'm trying to

368
00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:23.108
write this series, you know, which is very

369
00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:25.838
different from, it's very different from the way I

370
00:20:25.848 --> 00:20:29.289
usually write. And so I'm, it, it's

371
00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:32.068
also forcing me to take my own advice and to

372
00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:38.318
follow that. Um So that's that, I don't

373
00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:40.578
know where else to go with that. But,

374
00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:44.209
um, oh, ok. So le let me

375
00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:47.750
put, let me put a pin on that book

376
00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:51.180
coaching thing because I want to get back to that

377
00:20:51.189 --> 00:20:52.779
. I don't know if to, if today or

378
00:20:52.828 --> 00:20:56.239
next time. Let's see, because I, because

379
00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.199
I have a particular uh interesting, let's say thought

380
00:21:00.209 --> 00:21:04.150
experiment to ask you about that thought experiments. We

381
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.608
always talk about thought experiments when we get together.

382
00:21:07.618 --> 00:21:10.020
It's great. Yeah. But, but le let

383
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.381
me ask you this, uh are there times where

384
00:21:12.391 --> 00:21:15.421
you get a little bit frustrated about what you think

385
00:21:15.432 --> 00:21:21.451
are perhaps some of the limitations of your medium?

386
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:25.842
There is limitations of being a writer instead of being

387
00:21:25.852 --> 00:21:30.442
, for example, uh Mange or someone who creates

388
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.391
uh comics or uh a film director. Just because

389
00:21:34.472 --> 00:21:37.604
for example, in those particular cases, they have

390
00:21:37.614 --> 00:21:41.644
visual aid to the story, right? I mean

391
00:21:41.653 --> 00:21:42.604
, are, are there times where you, where

392
00:21:42.614 --> 00:21:45.644
you think? Oh my God, if I was

393
00:21:45.653 --> 00:21:48.403
doing a movie instead of a book or if I

394
00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:52.202
was doing a comic instead of a book, this

395
00:21:52.212 --> 00:21:56.354
would be so much easier to portray or I,

396
00:21:56.364 --> 00:21:57.253
I mean, I'm not trying to ask you here

397
00:21:57.263 --> 00:22:00.163
, of course, but I'm not, I'm not

398
00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:04.326
trying to imply that that uh a book is better

399
00:22:04.336 --> 00:22:08.326
or worse than cinema or comics or whatever. It's

400
00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:14.994
just that perhaps you think that there are particular things

401
00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:18.776
, particular aspects that you think that perhaps are better

402
00:22:18.786 --> 00:22:25.505
than or portrayed in mediums where you have a visual

403
00:22:25.515 --> 00:22:26.536
aspect to them. For example, I, I

404
00:22:26.546 --> 00:22:30.078
think that is, yes, I mean, the

405
00:22:30.088 --> 00:22:33.068
, the short answer is yes, I, you

406
00:22:33.078 --> 00:22:34.140
know, I, you can almost see that at

407
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:40.650
play in any medium. You can see where uh

408
00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:45.769
on occasion, at least where um the creator had

409
00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:48.868
to invent a device. Maybe it's a narrator,

410
00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:52.559
you know, who, who in a film,

411
00:22:52.568 --> 00:22:55.939
you know, who kind of talks over what's going

412
00:22:55.949 --> 00:23:00.479
on. Um Because they, they simply weren't able

413
00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:03.880
to adequately tell the story without that. And for

414
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.088
sure, there are times because I'm a really visual

415
00:23:07.098 --> 00:23:08.779
person. I love film, you know, II

416
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:12.318
, I enjoy film as much as I enjoy reading

417
00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:18.539
a really juicy novel. Um So there are many

418
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:21.900
times when I'm writing something and I really have to

419
00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:29.858
stop and think because I'm trying to um explain something

420
00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:33.789
that's very visual and yet I don't want to do

421
00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:37.939
it in a way that bores or exhaust the reader

422
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.479
. And I'm, you know, I'm sure that

423
00:23:41.489 --> 00:23:45.118
that's the case and for someone, you know,

424
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.059
creating manga or, um you know, comic books

425
00:23:48.068 --> 00:23:51.489
, comic books, you know, it's not like

426
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.769
in most cases, you can have someone do a

427
00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:56.279
monologue that's this long, you know, I mean

428
00:23:56.289 --> 00:23:59.068
, you have to have a very crisp, it's

429
00:23:59.078 --> 00:24:00.809
kind of like tweeting, you know. Well,

430
00:24:00.818 --> 00:24:04.779
well, actually, actually it's nice but, but

431
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:08.709
actually it's also interesting because there are many different kinds

432
00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:14.539
of styles for comic books and manga because there are

433
00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:18.088
um some creators that let's put it this way,

434
00:24:18.098 --> 00:24:22.920
they are very verbose. So sometimes you get almost

435
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.689
walls of text and you are like, oh come

436
00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:30.750
on, it's, you know, to me,

437
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.959
then you lose the visual and the whole point is

438
00:24:32.969 --> 00:24:36.098
the visual. It's the play between the words in

439
00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:38.279
the bubble, right? But some of those creators

440
00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:44.150
are actually very good and sometimes that sort of wall

441
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:48.568
of text is needed or warranted. But, but

442
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.689
, but there are others and again, I'm not

443
00:24:52.699 --> 00:24:56.289
saying that one way is better than the other.

444
00:24:56.439 --> 00:24:59.578
It's uh whatever you prefer. But there are others

445
00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:04.469
that they almost do not have any text at all

446
00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:08.118
. It's the, they are so good with uh

447
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:14.920
telling you a story just through images that they uh

448
00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:18.640
they just need one word here or there. Sometimes

449
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.769
they even o on a single page, they occupy

450
00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:25.920
it with an image and then one single vertical wor

451
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.969
word or something like that and it's enough. So

452
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:32.348
, you know, it, it is, it's

453
00:25:32.358 --> 00:25:37.000
, it's amazing how uh the many different ways there

454
00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:41.630
are for people to create great stories, I guess

455
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.670
there, there are and they're infinite, aren't they

456
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.809
? And, and it just sort of depends on

457
00:25:47.818 --> 00:25:53.559
um on, on the way on the creators approach

458
00:25:53.568 --> 00:25:56.939
and what their, what their own skills are.

459
00:25:56.608 --> 00:26:00.529
No, you know, some are, it's amazing

460
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.449
when you read some books that are so dialogue heavy

461
00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:07.239
and yet they don't feel that way because, you

462
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.430
know, reading just a bunch of dialogue can without

463
00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:12.689
any descriptors, you know, without anything in between

464
00:26:12.699 --> 00:26:15.400
that tells you where they are or, you know

465
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.640
, how a character, a little movement that a

466
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.838
character might have made that, that lets you know

467
00:26:21.848 --> 00:26:25.439
what exactly they're trying to say. E even though

468
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.078
, you know, they might be talking about the

469
00:26:26.088 --> 00:26:30.279
weather but really they're talking about something else underneath and

470
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:32.160
, and, you know, that just because of

471
00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:33.160
, you know, a look, they give someone

472
00:26:33.368 --> 00:26:37.459
, you, you know what? It's incredible to

473
00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:40.729
be able to do that without that, you know

474
00:26:40.739 --> 00:26:42.539
, without those, that those descriptors, you know

475
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:45.130
, and just to do it through dialogue. And

476
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.559
then on the other hand, you have other people

477
00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:49.029
who will have almost no dialogue at all, which

478
00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:53.838
can also be dreary and yet are able to communicate

479
00:26:55.469 --> 00:26:56.930
a scene, a party, a cocktail party where

480
00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:00.670
everybody is talking, you know, without hardly a

481
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.049
single word of dialogue and yet it's incredible, you

482
00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.078
know, OK, so I'm going to give you

483
00:27:04.088 --> 00:27:07.900
two different examples. So, uh first of all

484
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.828
, I'm uh a sucker for a good dialogue story

485
00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:15.989
. I love, I love dialogue. I mean

486
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.989
, even in movies, one of the things,

487
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.209
one of the criteria that I use to classify a

488
00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:26.858
movie as good is it has good dialogue. OK

489
00:27:26.868 --> 00:27:29.848
. So for me, it's almost all of what

490
00:27:30.108 --> 00:27:33.883
makes, makes me wanna throw rotten tomatoes. But

491
00:27:33.892 --> 00:27:37.821
, but there's, there's a movie, I don't

492
00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:40.071
know if you ever watch it, watched it.

493
00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:42.511
Uh My dinner with Andre. Oh, yes.

494
00:27:44.093 --> 00:27:47.883
Oh my God. Look, there's the visual aid

495
00:27:47.892 --> 00:27:49.972
there for sure, because it's a movie. But

496
00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:53.224
still, it's one of my favorite movies and it's

497
00:27:53.234 --> 00:27:56.915
just, it's as simple as you can get.

498
00:27:56.925 --> 00:28:00.566
It's like two guys, two guys having dinner and

499
00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:08.695
, and, and having A&E long conversation about anything

500
00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:11.994
and everything. And I really love that movie and

501
00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:15.796
, and then on the others on the other side

502
00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:19.759
, uh there's a Portuguese writer from the 19th century

503
00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:26.769
called S Kos. And uh he's magnum opus or

504
00:28:26.779 --> 00:28:29.930
at least the book that people consider his magnum opus

505
00:28:29.939 --> 00:28:33.729
. It's even mandatory reading here in Portuguese schools is

506
00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:38.689
uh the Mayas in English and Portuguese Mayas. But

507
00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:42.209
anyway, and he, he is, he was

508
00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:47.229
a realist writer. I mean, realism from the

509
00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:52.539
19th century where many times some of those writers were

510
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:56.009
really heavy when it comes to description, I mean

511
00:28:56.019 --> 00:28:59.939
, sin, description and describing places and all of

512
00:28:59.949 --> 00:29:03.199
that. And I mean, I love the story

513
00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:06.078
, but I have to be honest whenever it gets

514
00:29:06.088 --> 00:29:10.318
to the descriptions, I have to skip them because

515
00:29:10.328 --> 00:29:12.640
it's just too much. I mean, he describes

516
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.789
every single object in the room and I'm like,

517
00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.959
oh, come on, man. Well, yeah

518
00:29:19.969 --> 00:29:22.410
, you have to. II I feel at least

519
00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.299
, yeah, I mean, I guess you don't

520
00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:26.108
have to but um I, I feel like you

521
00:29:26.118 --> 00:29:30.920
want to leave something to the imagination of the reader

522
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.799
for them to fill in you know, you want

523
00:29:32.809 --> 00:29:33.670
to sketch it for sure. And you want to

524
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.559
give them a little color here and there. But

525
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.098
that makes it the reader's own too. That's how

526
00:29:41.108 --> 00:29:44.769
, you know, readers feel a sense of um

527
00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:48.739
investment in a look about to use their imaginations too

528
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.930
and about the descriptions. I don't know if you

529
00:29:52.939 --> 00:29:55.799
agree with me on this or not, but the

530
00:29:55.809 --> 00:29:59.358
descriptions I like the most are the ones where you

531
00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:03.630
are describing relevant things to the story. So I

532
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.880
don't know, let's think about the concept of uh

533
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.118
Chekhov's gun. OK. So you're describing the gun

534
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.250
but the gun, the gun gets used but you

535
00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:19.568
, but just describing all the chairs, the tables

536
00:30:19.682 --> 00:30:22.301
are, these are that way and then it doesn't

537
00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:26.682
matter at all to the plot because you're not going

538
00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:29.113
to use the chair or the table or the call

539
00:30:29.472 --> 00:30:33.021
or whatever, or the chandelier or whatever. I

540
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.261
, I mean, it's just too much for me

541
00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:38.702
if you're describing things that do not. I,

542
00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:44.982
I mean, I understand that descriptions might also not

543
00:30:44.992 --> 00:30:48.675
be used useful for the plot itself. It's,

544
00:30:48.685 --> 00:30:53.526
it's just describing a beautiful scenery or a beautiful house

545
00:30:53.536 --> 00:30:56.365
or I, I understand that people might like that

546
00:30:56.375 --> 00:31:00.036
, but for me, it's just uh I,

547
00:31:00.046 --> 00:31:03.556
I don't know, it breaks the pace of the

548
00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:06.826
story, you know, I don't like excessive description

549
00:31:06.836 --> 00:31:07.826
and I, I think I've, I think I've

550
00:31:07.836 --> 00:31:11.105
committed that sin as a writer by the way.

551
00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:18.309
And um often I'll just speak for myself. It

552
00:31:18.318 --> 00:31:23.170
, it, that, that needs to be taken

553
00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:29.000
out, I think during the editorial process because I

554
00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:30.890
think sometimes when you're writing a story and you're listening

555
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:37.769
and on that story, um you know, you're

556
00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:41.130
, you're building the environment in your own mind.

557
00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:44.250
If you haven't, if you're not the kind of

558
00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:45.930
person who builds it excessively on the front end,

559
00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:48.838
which I don't do. I, I feel like

560
00:31:48.848 --> 00:31:51.368
I find that inhibiting and, and then you're always

561
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.848
at least I am not you. But then I'm

562
00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:55.920
always checking to see what was it that I said

563
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.479
needs to be in that. Oh, well,

564
00:31:56.489 --> 00:32:00.529
I guess I should write that in and that interrupts

565
00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:04.529
my flow. Um But for sure. And then

566
00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:07.400
, then what you're faced with sometimes most of the

567
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.799
time is that at least in some parts of your

568
00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:12.809
story you've over described because you, you know,

569
00:32:12.818 --> 00:32:14.108
you get into a room and you're like, well

570
00:32:14.118 --> 00:32:15.559
, where, what is this room? And then

571
00:32:15.568 --> 00:32:16.660
you, you know, you, you describe it

572
00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:20.170
and sometimes you might even describe it really, really

573
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.949
well and you've got to make the decision then and

574
00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:25.489
not be vain about it for heaven's sake and say

575
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.729
, OK, that's a great paragraph. But it's

576
00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:30.459
got to go or it's got to be cut by

577
00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:32.199
two thirds because who cares? You know what I

578
00:32:32.209 --> 00:32:36.150
mean? It's inhibiting and it's, it's clunky.

579
00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.890
It's, you know, you, you, you

580
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:43.170
, you not enhancing the experience of the reader and

581
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.439
look again again, people who like that kind of

582
00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:50.689
thing perfectly, perfectly fine. I, I,

583
00:32:50.699 --> 00:32:52.818
I'm not bothered by that at all, but hi

584
00:32:52.828 --> 00:32:58.108
myself, I'm, I'm a character and plot guy

585
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.380
characters and plots are the, the, the two

586
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:05.588
most important things for me. I mean, you

587
00:33:05.598 --> 00:33:10.019
can even be uh, extremely bad at describing places

588
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:14.868
and it doesn't matter much to me as long as

589
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:19.959
the, the characters are well developed and the plot

590
00:33:19.969 --> 00:33:23.088
is interesting. II, I agree. I love

591
00:33:23.098 --> 00:33:27.640
character driven stories. They're my favorite. I like

592
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.759
a good plot. You know, I've been,

593
00:33:28.769 --> 00:33:30.890
I, I want there to be a plot,

594
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:32.180
um, with the characters but those are the two

595
00:33:32.189 --> 00:33:34.959
most important things to me. And I think that

596
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:37.150
, you know, like some readers, you know

597
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.578
, the sort of, um, you know,

598
00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:45.328
the, the Dan Brown stories, for instance,

599
00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:47.390
those, those are great. They plot their plot

600
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.779
, plot, plot, plot, plot. Um

601
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.078
, it's, they're for people who love puzzles.

602
00:33:53.108 --> 00:33:55.809
Yeah. And a lot of mysteries are that way

603
00:33:55.818 --> 00:33:58.799
, you know? Exactly. Not exactly how they're

604
00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:00.420
going to end. You may not know exactly who

605
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.410
did it but you, you know the procedure through

606
00:34:02.568 --> 00:34:07.049
the story and it's, it's, it really is

607
00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:08.869
like playing a game, um, a board game

608
00:34:08.878 --> 00:34:10.728
or doing, uh, doing some kind of,

609
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:15.168
um, word puzzle, a crossword puzzle or whatnot

610
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.159
. And I, I like a little more than

611
00:34:17.168 --> 00:34:19.829
that. It's kind of, you know, why

612
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.530
I like, uh, mystery writers. Like,

613
00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:24.369
um, well, I feel like PD James does

614
00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:30.179
a really great job that she, she creates a

615
00:34:30.188 --> 00:34:34.688
world and it's not just a puzzle. Oh,

616
00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.699
no. Look, II, I definitely think that

617
00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:40.378
, I think that the crime stories are some of

618
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:45.059
the best ones out there to explore human psychology.

619
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.019
For sure, for sure. And that's why I

620
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.500
love to read. I like to explore human psychology

621
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.039
. I like to be the person sitting there,

622
00:34:52.228 --> 00:34:53.820
you know, watching people go by. I like

623
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:59.398
watching my own behavior. Um And as you know

624
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.760
, and I like to be as detached about it

625
00:35:00.769 --> 00:35:04.668
as possible and, you know, understand my own

626
00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:07.289
motives in a, in a kind of clear eyed

627
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.199
way. And I like to do that with others

628
00:35:08.208 --> 00:35:15.789
. It's um I, I just find that to

629
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.889
be really, really interesting and, but, but

630
00:35:17.898 --> 00:35:22.750
the, the then Brown books look, I,

631
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:28.010
I know that perhaps I will be crucified by some

632
00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:31.250
intellectual people. But I actually like Dan Brown.

633
00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:35.128
I do. No, no, no, I

634
00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:37.168
, I was, I, that wasn't a criticism

635
00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:37.409
of Dan. No, no, no. I

636
00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:42.599
think I'm saying it's a certain style of writing that

637
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:49.349
is, that's plot focused and hugely addictive because it's

638
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.239
a puzzle and it's primarily a puzzle. It's not

639
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.668
that um his characters aren't, aren't interesting, but

640
00:35:55.679 --> 00:36:00.360
that's not the focus of the book. Um What

641
00:36:00.369 --> 00:36:02.579
is it, the character in it is in Robert

642
00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.610
Langdon? I think the professor really interesting concept for

643
00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:08.820
a character, but the character doesn't get developed in

644
00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:12.219
any massive, you know, or, or deep

645
00:36:12.228 --> 00:36:15.938
way. It's about the puzzle. And, um

646
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.809
you know, uh but, but by the,

647
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.148
by the way, since, since you touch there

648
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:24.019
on character development, I also wanted to ask you

649
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.809
this. So because people, uh I, I

650
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.250
mean, at least the more critical kind of people

651
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:37.489
, they tend to uh talk a lot about uh

652
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:44.228
developing and liking a multi-layered characters that is characters that

653
00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:49.809
are not just one dimensional and that are psychologically complex

654
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.648
. And I mean, uh but what does that

655
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:55.840
mean? Exactly? Because uh sometimes, so ju

656
00:36:55.849 --> 00:37:00.090
just to, I, I mean, run through

657
00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:05.179
a sort of abstract example, but sometimes people complain

658
00:37:05.188 --> 00:37:09.139
about characters being one dimensional. But then uh on

659
00:37:09.148 --> 00:37:14.780
the other hand, sometimes people also complain about characters

660
00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:19.099
breaking character and, and sometimes it seems a bit

661
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.128
weird to me because not always, but some of

662
00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:27.378
those times what people are referring to is, oh

663
00:37:27.389 --> 00:37:31.340
, so this character did something in this particular situation

664
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:37.090
or uh behaved toward another character in a way that

665
00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:44.519
doesn't uh doesn't go along with the kind of expectations

666
00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.219
you have for him. But I, isn't it

667
00:37:46.228 --> 00:37:52.378
a bit weird because we ourselves in our, let's

668
00:37:52.389 --> 00:37:58.300
say real lives, we don't behave the same way

669
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.449
with everyone, right? I mean, I mean

670
00:38:02.769 --> 00:38:05.610
, I, I mean, we, we have

671
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:08.849
, we behave differently depending on the person we,

672
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:15.070
we are interacting with and the kind of relationship we

673
00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:16.269
have with them. Right. So, so what

674
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.570
I'm trying to say is, oh, I don't

675
00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:23.590
know. Let's say that someone, um, I

676
00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:28.179
know, let's say that you're talking about Tony Soprano

677
00:38:28.269 --> 00:38:30.800
and he is a criminal and he's a very tough

678
00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:36.199
guy or, I mean, apparently tough guy.

679
00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:38.159
Uh, and, uh, uh, and then

680
00:38:38.168 --> 00:38:43.699
, uh, suddenly he's a guy who can't really

681
00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:46.840
hurt Children and animals and all of that. I

682
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:50.429
, I mean, people, perhaps, sometimes people

683
00:38:50.438 --> 00:38:54.119
are expecting for a criminal to be a psychopath and

684
00:38:54.128 --> 00:39:00.489
to be bad to everyone around him. But that

685
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.590
doesn't need to be the case necessarily. No,

686
00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:07.760
they can be, um, they can act in

687
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:09.438
, you know, what can be viewed as a

688
00:39:09.449 --> 00:39:14.679
psychopathic matter under very certain circumstances. I think,

689
00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:20.929
um, terrorists are a great example who might themselves

690
00:39:20.938 --> 00:39:23.489
have, you know, completely normal family lives if

691
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.469
you went home and have a wife and Children,

692
00:39:25.478 --> 00:39:30.820
whatever it is. Um, and then under a

693
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:37.489
very particular circumstance they're capable of doing horrendous. Thanks

694
00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:43.889
. Yeah. Um, but, but like with

695
00:39:43.898 --> 00:39:45.860
war, you know, that's something that happens a

696
00:39:45.869 --> 00:39:49.300
lot more common under, under really intense circumstances like

697
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:50.628
that. It's something that, you know, a

698
00:39:50.639 --> 00:39:52.519
soldier has to contend with. It's something that someone

699
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.519
who is, you know, in an occupied land

700
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.260
or is, you know, an aggressor has to

701
00:39:59.269 --> 00:40:00.369
contend with all of this, even if they think

702
00:40:00.378 --> 00:40:02.179
that they have every right to be doing what they're

703
00:40:02.188 --> 00:40:05.760
doing. But, but, you know, now

704
00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:07.840
that I've described that to you, that sort of

705
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:10.728
, uh, I don't know, contradictory or conflicting

706
00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:15.128
view that people have of characters where they expect them

707
00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:16.280
to be one thing, but at the same time

708
00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.550
, they want them to be multi layered. And

709
00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:22.978
so, I mean, and now now that I

710
00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:25.079
have described that to you, it came to my

711
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.978
mind that perhaps the way people react or think react

712
00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:31.938
to or think about characters is the same way we

713
00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:37.409
think about real people because we expect people to be

714
00:40:37.679 --> 00:40:42.418
, let's say a good person or a bad person

715
00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:46.329
every time toward everyone in every situation. But sometimes

716
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:52.659
people are just different people in different situations, they

717
00:40:52.668 --> 00:40:57.168
behave differently to different kinds of people and sometimes people

718
00:40:57.179 --> 00:41:01.070
are behaving unexpected ways as well. It's true,

719
00:41:01.418 --> 00:41:07.010
human beings are predictable only for kind of it for

720
00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:09.398
short spurts. You know, you might be able

721
00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:12.320
to predict if you, you know what I'm saying

722
00:41:12.329 --> 00:41:15.378
, you might be able to predict um the way

723
00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:17.260
a conversation will go in the first few minutes because

724
00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:22.309
you're exchanging pleasantries. Not always, but, you

725
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.510
know, sometimes the conversation starts off and it's,

726
00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:27.369
you know, it starts off in a completely different

727
00:41:27.378 --> 00:41:29.309
place than you never expected. But, you know

728
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.619
, you can pretty much predict when you run into

729
00:41:30.628 --> 00:41:32.250
someone on the street that you haven't seen in a

730
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.418
while that, oh, nice to see you Ricardo

731
00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:37.090
. How are you? I'm doing well. Can

732
00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:39.059
you believe this weather? No, I can't.

733
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.789
Sure it is hot for this time of year.

734
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.570
You know, you can predict it until a certain

735
00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:47.070
point and then you have no idea. If you

736
00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:50.019
actually sit down with this person and you don't,

737
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.398
you know, go your separate ways, you have

738
00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:53.139
no idea really where that conversation is going to go

739
00:41:53.688 --> 00:41:59.050
. Um, but II, I, I think

740
00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:01.619
when two things happen, when someone says, oh

741
00:42:01.628 --> 00:42:05.378
, I, I didn't like that because that character

742
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:13.208
wouldn't do that. Um Either it's because the writer

743
00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:19.289
failed. They did not, um, at least

744
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.458
at that point have the skill to help take you

745
00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:28.559
on that character's journey and show you how the character

746
00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.079
, um, you know, kind of build the

747
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:35.300
latter rungs between this behavior over here and then this

748
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:40.219
seemingly out of character behavior over here. Um It

749
00:42:40.228 --> 00:42:44.280
could be because of the, uh, reader's expectation

750
00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:45.309
that, hey, I wanted a happy ending.

751
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.398
I thought those two were gonna end up together,

752
00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:51.329
you know what I mean or whatever, you know

753
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.519
, and, and their expectation kind of superseded,

754
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.728
maybe what was organic to the story in their own

755
00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:00.280
mind, at least. And, um, so

756
00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:04.309
they, they could not accept the story that the

757
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.728
writer actually wrote because they wanted. This is what

758
00:43:07.739 --> 00:43:07.978
I wanted. I mean, you, I,

759
00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:10.030
I think you and I have talked about um,

760
00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:14.059
certain genres like the romance genre, for instance,

761
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.139
that um, a book is not a romance and

762
00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:21.590
unless it has a happy ending then it's not a

763
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:24.079
romance that it's a love story. If it has

764
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:28.599
a, you know, a different ending other than

765
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.539
, and they lived happily ever after or they lived

766
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.789
happily ever after for now, you know what I

767
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.280
mean? Um, and so, uh, you

768
00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:38.789
know, you, a writer has to be very

769
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.938
careful depending on the genre that they're writing in.

770
00:43:40.949 --> 00:43:45.139
Because if you are writing a, a AAA piece

771
00:43:45.148 --> 00:43:50.340
that is pretty strictly adhering to genre, you're setting

772
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:53.728
up very specific expectations for the reader. And if

773
00:43:53.739 --> 00:43:59.179
you deny the reader what they're expecting, um you'll

774
00:43:59.188 --> 00:44:00.260
be punished for it. Now, if the reader

775
00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:04.898
is expecting something that's genre bending from the get go

776
00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:07.918
, they'll usually go on that journey with you if

777
00:44:07.929 --> 00:44:09.699
they like your writing, you know, assuming that

778
00:44:09.708 --> 00:44:13.860
they actually like what you have to say and um

779
00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:16.280
and they'll enjoy being taken on that journey and they'll

780
00:44:16.289 --> 00:44:19.159
say, oh my gosh, can you believe that

781
00:44:19.168 --> 00:44:22.929
this happened? Um And, but it, it

782
00:44:22.938 --> 00:44:24.398
, it, it does a lot of, it

783
00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:36.139
depends on expectation. And I, I think also

784
00:44:36.148 --> 00:44:37.398
, I think a, a writer or creator has

785
00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:45.648
to be careful not to um not to make a

786
00:44:45.659 --> 00:44:49.438
character, do something or create a situation just for

787
00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:51.329
the sake of creating it because they want to do

788
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.179
something different or because they want to make a,

789
00:44:52.188 --> 00:44:54.559
a political point, you know, it's, or

790
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.458
or, or a personal point, you know,

791
00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:00.409
it, it, that's kind of where the artistry

792
00:45:00.418 --> 00:45:05.739
comes from is understanding what is outside of what you're

793
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.309
creating, what is organic to the story that you've

794
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.550
set up and you've perhaps, you know, written

795
00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:14.550
the bones off. But the, the fact is

796
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:24.039
there's something else going on besides, um, besides

797
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.510
your, you know, your expectations, your original

798
00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:29.329
expectations for the story. I mean, I can't

799
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.708
tell you how many times I started to write something

800
00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:32.750
and then, and I've even had it, you

801
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.639
know, plotted out and everything. And then I

802
00:45:36.648 --> 00:45:39.840
realize at some point in the story that something has

803
00:45:39.849 --> 00:45:44.530
to change because I start to recognize and this can

804
00:45:44.539 --> 00:45:46.019
be really painful by the way because it can undo

805
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:49.840
a lot of work you've already done or it can

806
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:52.260
just hurt because you, you're realizing that something really

807
00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:55.128
painful has to happen in this story and, and

808
00:45:55.139 --> 00:45:59.309
writing that is painful. You know, if you

809
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.539
have to kill a character for instance, that you've

810
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:04.679
become really attached to and you're realizing, oh my

811
00:46:04.739 --> 00:46:07.320
God, this person can't survive this. I didn't

812
00:46:07.329 --> 00:46:08.269
realize that when I was writing it. You know

813
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.289
, I thought this person was gonna survive. I

814
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.010
thought this person was gonna go on and, and

815
00:46:14.019 --> 00:46:16.688
do you know the things that I had prescribed for

816
00:46:16.699 --> 00:46:20.898
them? But I'm realizing right now that they're about

817
00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:24.010
to get it in the neck. Yeah. No

818
00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:29.199
. No. About the ex the expectations So several

819
00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:31.079
ideas. So one of them is you really get

820
00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:39.079
to have direct contact with how different expectations make people

821
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:45.030
love or hate stories. When there's an ongoing story

822
00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:46.340
. And you go, for example, to online

823
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:52.398
forums and people are trying to uh trying to imagine

824
00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.159
what we like happen next in the story. And

825
00:46:54.168 --> 00:46:58.800
then there are people that say, oh the X

826
00:46:58.809 --> 00:47:00.090
should happen. And then there are people that say

827
00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:02.369
, why should happen. And there are people that

828
00:47:02.378 --> 00:47:07.360
say, oh wherever, wherever uh let's see what

829
00:47:07.369 --> 00:47:08.989
happens and then we'll see if it's good or not

830
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.458
. And when the uh for example, people who

831
00:47:14.469 --> 00:47:17.110
got it right? Usually like the story, people

832
00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:22.079
who got it wrong usually. Yeah. And then

833
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:25.469
the ones that were just open to see where things

834
00:47:25.478 --> 00:47:29.030
would go. I mean, most of the time

835
00:47:29.039 --> 00:47:30.708
, if they already like the story, they keep

836
00:47:30.719 --> 00:47:34.550
liking it sometimes it's just, oh, this was

837
00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:37.039
a bit silly. Uh And then also you mentioned

838
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.599
uh politics at a certain point there. And I

839
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:45.010
was thinking like, ee even politics, sometimes,

840
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:49.530
even if a book is heavily political, sometimes it

841
00:47:49.539 --> 00:47:54.059
works. So it just, just think about Ayn

842
00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:58.708
Rand's Atlas Rugged. I, I mean, for

843
00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:02.349
me, that book is awful, but Libertarians,

844
00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.889
they love the book. It's like, it's like

845
00:48:05.898 --> 00:48:12.090
the best book ever. Conde's books are I think

846
00:48:12.099 --> 00:48:15.708
, beautiful and they're, I think he was absolutely

847
00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:21.659
robbed of the Nobel in literature, but they're highly

848
00:48:21.668 --> 00:48:25.070
political. You know, um, I don't think

849
00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:27.539
it's ever, I, I think that the,

850
00:48:29.559 --> 00:48:31.438
the story is at the forefront and the story is

851
00:48:31.449 --> 00:48:36.079
so compelling which is what makes it, um,

852
00:48:37.639 --> 00:48:39.219
which is what makes it so good. You know

853
00:48:39.228 --> 00:48:43.648
, even though he has a very clear political point

854
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:45.219
of view, I mean, it's kind of impossible

855
00:48:45.228 --> 00:48:46.809
to miss but, and, and it's interesting because

856
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:50.099
what I, I read it's just the opposite.

857
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.208
Her politics are fascinating. You know what I mean

858
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.860
? And, you know, her characters aren't that

859
00:48:54.869 --> 00:48:58.739
great. The story is interesting. I think the

860
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:00.780
plots are pretty interesting but the characters aren't that great

861
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:05.059
but her, but she is, she is such

862
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:08.728
a force. She is so interesting that, like

863
00:49:08.739 --> 00:49:12.260
, like you said, particularly libertarians, particularly if

864
00:49:12.269 --> 00:49:17.789
you are, um, you know, highly susceptible

865
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.550
to that point of view. It's riveting for you

866
00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:23.208
the way, you know, happily ever after is

867
00:49:23.219 --> 00:49:25.889
the only acceptable outcome for someone who is a true

868
00:49:25.898 --> 00:49:30.219
lover of romance. Yeah. And, and the

869
00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:32.188
same for the same for people on the left.

870
00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:36.969
I don't know if, you know Berthold Brecht or

871
00:49:36.978 --> 00:49:38.918
a writer from the, I think the late 19th

872
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.250
century. And, I mean, his book I

873
00:49:42.449 --> 00:49:44.829
haven't read. Yeah, he, his books,

874
00:49:45.418 --> 00:49:51.389
his books are like a cheesecake for leftists. It's

875
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:54.760
, it's just, it's just like bashing the powerful

876
00:49:54.769 --> 00:49:59.320
uplifting the Van Dren. Yeah. But, and

877
00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.949
I mean, the books are ob, uh,

878
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:07.239
objectively speaking, not that great, but for someone

879
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.260
who is just for someone who, who, you

880
00:50:10.269 --> 00:50:13.780
know, wants to experience that. Right. Yeah

881
00:50:15.418 --> 00:50:17.289
. And then uh just going back to the character

882
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.250
for a second. Uh Also there are particular kinds

883
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:29.398
of uh stories or fiction where a sort of one

884
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:34.539
dimensional characters work pretty well and work best. So

885
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:37.728
for example, Mr Bean, the, the comedy

886
00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:42.019
series, I mean, I mean, Mr Bin

887
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.978
is the simplest character, you can create the,

888
00:50:45.989 --> 00:50:52.199
the thing there is about creating funny situations. It's

889
00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:57.938
not really about the character being extremely complex. It's

890
00:50:57.949 --> 00:51:01.280
a very simple character, but it's a great comedy

891
00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:06.050
series, right? No, it's true. And

892
00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:08.708
that's, that's kind of WW well, you know

893
00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:12.530
, that goes back to, to whatever the particular

894
00:51:12.539 --> 00:51:14.688
strengths of the writer are because there are people who

895
00:51:14.699 --> 00:51:21.708
are incredibly good at creating circumstances that force the characters

896
00:51:21.719 --> 00:51:23.239
to react to the circumstances and then others do the

897
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.659
inverse where the creator or the creators, where the

898
00:51:25.668 --> 00:51:30.989
characters influence the circumstances and all you wanna do is

899
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.360
is follow that character around and you know, watch

900
00:51:37.369 --> 00:51:40.300
them influence their environment to watch other people react to

901
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:44.349
them, other characters react to them, watch how

902
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:49.119
an organization might change by the addition of this person

903
00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:52.619
, you know, or um God, what is

904
00:51:52.628 --> 00:51:57.958
it that there's a great um what is it called

905
00:51:57.969 --> 00:51:59.110
? Oh God, I'm not going to bore you

906
00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.489
with it then because if I can't recall it,

907
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.000
I'm not gonna sit here going now. What was

908
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:07.449
that. But the story was basically about um a

909
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:12.159
bureaucrat who likes things to be the absolute same all

910
00:52:12.168 --> 00:52:14.829
the time. It's an old Thurber story, James

911
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:21.510
Thurber I believe, and a woman is hired into

912
00:52:21.519 --> 00:52:24.579
this company to make changes as his boss. And

913
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.478
that is very bad for this guy. He does

914
00:52:28.489 --> 00:52:30.969
not like change. And so he goes about orchestrating

915
00:52:30.978 --> 00:52:34.199
her demise, you know, I mean, not

916
00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:36.360
her literal demise but her demise in the company.

917
00:52:36.369 --> 00:52:38.369
And it's just, it's just so funny. Oh

918
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.369
my God, the only story that I can think

919
00:52:42.378 --> 00:52:45.519
of where those two things play together in this sort

920
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.820
of like Escher like way. You know, now

921
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:51.378
let me just say and you're probably going to laugh

922
00:52:51.389 --> 00:52:55.969
at this. But uh when you describe the character

923
00:52:55.978 --> 00:53:00.239
uh uh as being uh a guy who wanted for

924
00:53:00.429 --> 00:53:05.300
uh things to be always the same way. It

925
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:06.898
, it, it this is for you to uh

926
00:53:06.909 --> 00:53:08.449
to try to see, to have a glimpse at

927
00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:12.539
how my mind works. What came to my mind

928
00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:15.418
, someone who has, who likes to have control

929
00:53:15.429 --> 00:53:20.860
over everything around them. And then the two stories

930
00:53:20.869 --> 00:53:24.728
that came to my mind, Citizen Kane and 50

931
00:53:24.739 --> 00:53:30.708
shades of Gray. I got two stories that can

932
00:53:30.719 --> 00:53:32.829
possibly be more different, right? But this is

933
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:37.110
just for you to see how my mind works.

934
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:42.369
I think that's a good line. Oh my God

935
00:53:42.378 --> 00:53:45.090
, this would probably make for a, a good

936
00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:49.938
uh stand up plot. So I was thinking about

937
00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:52.289
Citizen Kane and 50 shades of gray came to mind

938
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.878
. Yeah. Rosebud has everything to do with B

939
00:53:58.889 --> 00:54:04.619
Ds M for sure. Yeah. Oh my God

940
00:54:04.679 --> 00:54:06.938
. You know, the, the, I hope

941
00:54:06.949 --> 00:54:08.010
I haven't mentioned this on one of our conversations because

942
00:54:08.019 --> 00:54:09.789
I think we did talk about 50 shades of grey

943
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.989
at one point. But I, I thought the

944
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.188
most interesting thing about the 50 shades of grey phenomenon

945
00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:21.050
came out of the prison system. Oh, really

946
00:54:21.449 --> 00:54:23.309
? Yes. Um, I read this, this

947
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.500
was back when, like, this was back when

948
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.619
50 shades of grey was kind of first out and

949
00:54:29.628 --> 00:54:31.869
it was first a huge phenomenon and everybody was reading

950
00:54:31.878 --> 00:54:37.239
it. And, um, the, the article

951
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.590
that I was reading, the writer focused on the

952
00:54:40.599 --> 00:54:45.128
fact that in men's prisons it was number one,

953
00:54:45.139 --> 00:54:49.489
what men were reading in prisons and in women's prisons

954
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.139
, it, it didn't even crack the top 10

955
00:54:52.148 --> 00:54:53.849
, maybe not even the top 20 which is sort

956
00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.889
of the opposite of what was happening outside of prison

957
00:54:57.898 --> 00:54:59.739
. Right. And as I was reading it,

958
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.148
I was thinking, well, that makes sense because

959
00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:05.780
those women are in prison probably because they killed the

960
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:07.829
son of a bitch just like this guy. You

961
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.159
know what I mean? They're used to being treated

962
00:55:10.168 --> 00:55:14.030
that way and they don't glamorize it, you know

963
00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:15.628
, they're like, you know what, when I

964
00:55:15.639 --> 00:55:19.590
look at Christian Gray, I think, Mark or

965
00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:22.438
whatever, you know? And, but I just

966
00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:24.668
thought that was so interesting that, um, that

967
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.500
, you know, women in prison weren't reading it

968
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.239
that they had, they, they weren't interested in

969
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.750
it. But, you know, the men were

970
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.519
definitely reading 50 shades of gray. But, but

971
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:38.458
, you know, may maybe the minority of prison

972
00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:43.648
women or prisoners, female prisoners that were reading 50

973
00:55:43.659 --> 00:55:46.409
shades of gray were the ones that those kinds of

974
00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:52.929
people where they, uh, like to get angry

975
00:55:52.938 --> 00:55:53.628
at the story. Oh, come on, I

976
00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:57.719
will keep reading or watching this because this is making

977
00:55:57.728 --> 00:56:00.340
me angry. It's true. And it's, it's

978
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:05.418
funny because there's this one, uh review that went

979
00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:07.889
, you know, viral on goodreads of 50 shades

980
00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:08.679
of gray. That was so funny. I mean

981
00:56:08.688 --> 00:56:10.949
, it was like crying funny, laugh out loud

982
00:56:10.958 --> 00:56:15.909
, funny. Um, and she was a hater

983
00:56:15.918 --> 00:56:16.668
, you know, she, she and her brother

984
00:56:16.679 --> 00:56:19.918
were reading it out loud to each other hating on

985
00:56:19.929 --> 00:56:22.168
it. And, you know, haters can just

986
00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:23.648
be so funny though sometimes. So it was just

987
00:56:24.398 --> 00:56:27.648
, it was really, really good. Um,

988
00:56:28.628 --> 00:56:30.639
you know, speaking of haters, I, when

989
00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:35.458
we were talking about, um, stories that go

990
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:42.559
kind of that, that perhaps betray readers expectations or

991
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.530
defy readers' expectations, I was thinking about, um

992
00:56:45.539 --> 00:56:49.628
, the Star Wars Universe and I'm, I don't

993
00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.010
know if you're a Star Wars fan. I am

994
00:56:51.019 --> 00:56:53.090
not well versed in this. I saw the first

995
00:56:53.099 --> 00:56:54.530
three, you know, the ones that came out

996
00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:58.128
in the seventies and I love them as a kid

997
00:56:58.199 --> 00:57:00.289
, but I did not, I have not followed

998
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.898
the series since then, since then. But what

999
00:57:01.909 --> 00:57:06.869
has been interesting to me is how angry Star Wars

1000
00:57:06.878 --> 00:57:12.059
fans are at Disney for how they, you know

1001
00:57:13.438 --> 00:57:15.780
, took, I apparently took the story sideways and

1002
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:19.849
, um, did not, uh give readers what

1003
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.559
they were or readers, readers watchers, um,

1004
00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:27.860
what they were hoping for. And it's also,

1005
00:57:27.869 --> 00:57:30.599
it's also funny because if you go on the internet

1006
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:36.208
, sometimes there's ongoing wars between different fandoms and,

1007
00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:37.869
and then, and then people vote on what's the

1008
00:57:37.878 --> 00:57:45.070
most toxic phantom out. It's, it's like,

1009
00:57:45.079 --> 00:57:47.010
oh my God, the Harry Potter fans versus the

1010
00:57:47.019 --> 00:57:50.809
Lord of the Rings fans and the Star Wars fans

1011
00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.320
versus the, the Star Trek fans and the other

1012
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:58.688
sci-fi universes. And then it's George RR Martin versus

1013
00:57:58.699 --> 00:58:01.530
Tolkien versus whoever. And it's, it's such,

1014
00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:06.648
it's a trail. Yeah. So, uh le

1015
00:58:06.659 --> 00:58:08.719
let me ask you another kind of question that I

1016
00:58:08.728 --> 00:58:14.800
think is it's something that even over this is our

1017
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:17.898
6th, 5th or sixth conversation. I lost count

1018
00:58:17.938 --> 00:58:21.628
by knowledge. But all I know is that I

1019
00:58:21.639 --> 00:58:24.659
now like need glasses to see you clearly. Well

1020
00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:27.250
, not when I, when I'm, when I

1021
00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:29.668
sit back and I didn't when we first started.

1022
00:58:29.679 --> 00:58:32.860
How's that? Well, I also have some white

1023
00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:37.628
hairs on my beard now and five years ago.

1024
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:39.550
Yeah. Well, they're a little blurry to me

1025
00:58:39.559 --> 00:58:42.090
so I don't see them I just see a nice

1026
00:58:42.099 --> 00:58:44.688
lush. Yeah, probably on camera. It's hard

1027
00:58:44.699 --> 00:58:46.500
to see them but I it, it's very easy

1028
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:51.500
to notice them in, in person. Anyway.

1029
00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:55.648
Are there any things when you're writing a story that

1030
00:58:55.659 --> 00:58:59.570
you just think to yourself? Ok. So I

1031
00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:02.449
would never go there. There is for example,

1032
00:59:02.708 --> 00:59:12.320
describing the very tiniest details of a crime or I

1033
00:59:12.329 --> 00:59:15.860
don't know, exploring topics that you think are uh

1034
00:59:15.869 --> 00:59:22.489
too immoral to explore in a story or perhaps creating

1035
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:27.344
characters that have specific idea is that you, that

1036
00:59:27.353 --> 00:59:29.434
you think are too immoral. I mean, do

1037
00:59:29.753 --> 00:59:34.675
, do you set any moral limits to what you

1038
00:59:34.684 --> 00:59:38.353
would explore in the story or not? Not that

1039
00:59:38.364 --> 00:59:44.610
I know of because I think that it's, it's

1040
00:59:44.619 --> 00:59:46.079
about, you know, how, how that is

1041
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:49.360
done. I mean, I don't, I,

1042
00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:57.849
I can't imagine ever writing something that genuinely glorify something

1043
00:59:57.860 --> 00:60:00.030
grotesque and doing it in a way that is,

1044
00:60:00.039 --> 00:60:07.010
you know, obviously an endorsement, let's put it

1045
00:60:07.019 --> 00:60:09.208
that way. You know what I mean? Excuse

1046
00:60:09.219 --> 00:60:14.909
me, I, all allergies are upon me but

1047
00:60:15.800 --> 00:60:17.309
II, I can't think of anything that I absolutely

1048
00:60:17.320 --> 00:60:22.539
wouldn't address. I always thought that I couldn't address

1049
00:60:22.550 --> 00:60:24.519
a child being hurt, uh especially being a mother

1050
00:60:24.530 --> 00:60:27.110
. That's really difficult. I mean, it is

1051
00:60:27.119 --> 00:60:30.969
really, really difficult. It's, you know,

1052
00:60:30.978 --> 00:60:32.099
in the same way that it's, uh, it's

1053
00:60:32.110 --> 00:60:37.148
also hard for me like to watch an, you

1054
00:60:37.159 --> 00:60:37.809
know, a dog being hurt, you know,

1055
00:60:37.820 --> 00:60:42.929
an animal being hurt in that way, but I

1056
00:60:42.938 --> 00:60:45.429
did address it in a book and that kind of

1057
00:60:45.438 --> 00:60:46.958
surprised me and I, and I did it because

1058
00:60:46.969 --> 00:60:50.110
I realized that I'd set up the story in such

1059
00:60:50.119 --> 00:60:52.188
a way that I had to address it. I

1060
00:60:52.199 --> 00:60:55.469
couldn't leave it. I didn't get into, um

1061
00:60:58.340 --> 00:61:00.360
, I didn't, you know, I didn't make

1062
00:61:00.369 --> 00:61:04.239
a meal of it. Um, and not that

1063
00:61:05.099 --> 00:61:07.119
maybe that III I, I'm not saying that it

1064
00:61:07.128 --> 00:61:09.378
would be bad to do that in all circumstances,

1065
00:61:09.619 --> 00:61:13.829
but that's just not something that I wanted to do

1066
00:61:13.840 --> 00:61:16.099
at all. But I realized that I did have

1067
00:61:16.110 --> 00:61:20.179
to address it because, um, it was a

1068
00:61:20.188 --> 00:61:22.369
sit, it was a war situation and a child

1069
00:61:22.378 --> 00:61:24.590
was, excuse me, I'm sorry. And the

1070
00:61:24.599 --> 00:61:28.739
child was killed. And, um, and it

1071
00:61:28.750 --> 00:61:30.139
was in a, in a, a pretty awful

1072
00:61:30.148 --> 00:61:34.659
way and by a pretty awful person. But,

1073
00:61:34.668 --> 00:61:38.570
um, but I felt like I, I was

1074
00:61:38.579 --> 00:61:43.099
shirking a responsibility to the reader if I didn't address

1075
00:61:43.110 --> 00:61:47.619
that, um, the reader was invested in this

1076
00:61:47.628 --> 00:61:50.909
story, was invested in the child. And also

1077
00:61:50.918 --> 00:61:55.199
it was necessary for the development of another character,

1078
00:61:55.679 --> 00:61:59.119
for that to happen to them, you know,

1079
00:61:59.128 --> 00:62:01.168
and for, I, I had to create a

1080
00:62:01.449 --> 00:62:07.139
circumstance that was awful enough that it would propel the

1081
00:62:07.148 --> 00:62:09.208
story to where it needed to go if that makes

1082
00:62:09.219 --> 00:62:15.239
sense. Um, so, and I, not

1083
00:62:15.250 --> 00:62:17.458
for any moral reason, I don't think it's,

1084
00:62:17.469 --> 00:62:22.699
it's ne it's necessarily immoral to um, depict,

1085
00:62:22.989 --> 00:62:25.780
uh, you know, a, a child being

1086
00:62:27.320 --> 00:62:29.708
hurt or killed. I think that it de depends

1087
00:62:29.719 --> 00:62:32.458
entirely upon context. But I never thought that I

1088
00:62:32.469 --> 00:62:35.739
would write it because I thought it would just be

1089
00:62:35.750 --> 00:62:38.659
too difficult and it was very difficult to write for

1090
00:62:38.668 --> 00:62:42.208
me. I avoided it for days because I knew

1091
00:62:42.219 --> 00:62:44.579
I had to write that scene and I, you

1092
00:62:44.590 --> 00:62:45.679
know, oh, I'll do some admin today.

1093
00:62:45.688 --> 00:62:47.800
Well, I, I have to write, um

1094
00:62:47.989 --> 00:62:51.188
, um, I'll write an essay on Family Law

1095
00:62:51.360 --> 00:62:52.760
, you know, whatever it is. I,

1096
00:62:52.769 --> 00:63:00.438
I really, I avoided it in a pretty egregious

1097
00:63:00.449 --> 00:63:02.199
way for several days until I finally sat down and

1098
00:63:02.208 --> 00:63:05.360
said this is ridiculous. This has to get written

1099
00:63:05.369 --> 00:63:07.898
and I'm gonna do it and it was such a

1100
00:63:07.909 --> 00:63:12.269
relief to get it done. It's hard. I

1101
00:63:12.280 --> 00:63:15.110
mean, it's very hard to write certain, yeah

1102
00:63:15.708 --> 00:63:19.039
. Uh, to write about certain topics and scenes

1103
00:63:19.050 --> 00:63:20.688
. I mean, it, it is really hard

1104
00:63:20.889 --> 00:63:22.590
. Ok. So let, let me ask you

1105
00:63:22.599 --> 00:63:25.438
then another question related to that. Have you ever

1106
00:63:25.449 --> 00:63:34.228
read or watched something fictional? Of course, where

1107
00:63:34.239 --> 00:63:37.869
you fought? O ok. So the author,

1108
00:63:37.878 --> 00:63:40.510
the author here went too far. I mean,

1109
00:63:40.519 --> 00:63:45.989
this is just too graphic, too detailed, too

1110
00:63:46.000 --> 00:63:50.719
violent. Have you ever, ever, has anything

1111
00:63:50.728 --> 00:63:57.148
like that ever happened to you? No, not

1112
00:63:57.159 --> 00:64:00.648
in something I've read. But there is, this

1113
00:64:00.659 --> 00:64:03.010
a long time ago, there is a book that

1114
00:64:03.019 --> 00:64:04.478
I read, which was a sequel. It was

1115
00:64:04.489 --> 00:64:11.958
the sequel to, um, was the book Hannibal

1116
00:64:11.969 --> 00:64:13.909
, it was the sequel to Silence of The Lambs

1117
00:64:14.168 --> 00:64:16.300
. But the book version where I read it and

1118
00:64:16.309 --> 00:64:19.458
I thought, what the hell is this? Do

1119
00:64:19.469 --> 00:64:24.688
you know what I mean? Um So, you

1120
00:64:24.699 --> 00:64:27.668
know, it, I, I really felt like

1121
00:64:28.458 --> 00:64:30.840
I felt like the author had gone off the rails

1122
00:64:30.849 --> 00:64:33.000
and was writing like a weird fantasy of theirs and

1123
00:64:33.010 --> 00:64:36.619
not, what was this? Not the story that

1124
00:64:36.628 --> 00:64:40.260
he had originally written book, it's his story.

1125
00:64:40.269 --> 00:64:43.559
So, just by definition, I'm wrong, right

1126
00:64:44.079 --> 00:64:45.938
? But as, as a reader, I felt

1127
00:64:45.949 --> 00:64:53.610
like he did not, um, that I felt

1128
00:64:53.619 --> 00:64:55.409
like he'd gone off the rails and not in a

1129
00:64:55.418 --> 00:64:57.519
grotesque sort of way. Not like, oh,

1130
00:64:57.530 --> 00:65:00.429
I don't want to read that but, you know

1131
00:65:00.438 --> 00:65:01.840
what the hell kind of way. But no,

1132
00:65:01.849 --> 00:65:06.300
I've never read anything that I can remember that.

1133
00:65:06.309 --> 00:65:11.878
Um, that I couldn't get through. I think

1134
00:65:12.349 --> 00:65:15.969
often if you are absorbed enough in a story,

1135
00:65:15.978 --> 00:65:17.659
well, one of two things can happen. You

1136
00:65:17.668 --> 00:65:19.219
might love a character so much that you're like,

1137
00:65:19.228 --> 00:65:20.619
oh my God, I know they're gonna die and

1138
00:65:20.628 --> 00:65:23.099
I can't read that. You know, you,

1139
00:65:23.110 --> 00:65:26.559
you, you skip ahead a few pages, you

1140
00:65:26.570 --> 00:65:30.219
know what happened, you accept it but you just

1141
00:65:30.228 --> 00:65:31.199
, you just can't go there. I understand that

1142
00:65:31.208 --> 00:65:35.349
. But usually in what I'm reading, um,

1143
00:65:38.070 --> 00:65:40.809
when I'm absorbed enough in a story, I can

1144
00:65:40.820 --> 00:65:45.619
take it and I can understand why the author put

1145
00:65:45.628 --> 00:65:48.489
it there in the first place and why, um

1146
00:65:49.188 --> 00:65:53.978
why I have to be taken through that in order

1147
00:65:53.989 --> 00:65:57.958
to, you know, get to the other side

1148
00:65:57.969 --> 00:65:59.559
, you know, the other part of the story

1149
00:65:59.570 --> 00:66:00.438
kind of like what I described with what I felt

1150
00:66:00.449 --> 00:66:02.280
like I had when I had to put in,

1151
00:66:03.050 --> 00:66:04.918
you know, a difficult scene about a child being

1152
00:66:04.929 --> 00:66:09.918
killed. Um I, I put it there because

1153
00:66:09.929 --> 00:66:14.260
I really didn't see any other way for the story

1154
00:66:14.269 --> 00:66:16.340
to evolve, you know, to, to the

1155
00:66:16.349 --> 00:66:17.699
, for the story to get to the place that

1156
00:66:17.708 --> 00:66:21.510
it needed to be. And usually when I'm reading

1157
00:66:21.519 --> 00:66:25.469
something II, I feel that as well that doesn't

1158
00:66:25.478 --> 00:66:29.099
mean that there aren't parts of stories that I haven't

1159
00:66:29.110 --> 00:66:31.500
read where I've winced. I mean, really what

1160
00:66:31.510 --> 00:66:39.949
comes to mind that was so difficult to face was

1161
00:66:39.958 --> 00:66:45.530
, um, Styron Sophie's Choice. Mhm. I

1162
00:66:45.539 --> 00:66:46.398
don't know if you've read Sophie's Choice or if you've

1163
00:66:46.409 --> 00:66:49.300
seen the movie. No, I, that one

1164
00:66:49.309 --> 00:66:51.849
particularly, I don't think so. No. But

1165
00:66:51.860 --> 00:66:56.918
, ii, I mean, the story about a

1166
00:66:56.929 --> 00:67:00.398
woman named Sophie who, um, ends up in

1167
00:67:00.409 --> 00:67:02.409
, during World War Two in a concentration camp and

1168
00:67:02.418 --> 00:67:04.648
they make, she has two Children and they make

1169
00:67:04.659 --> 00:67:06.409
her choose which one is going to be killed.

1170
00:67:08.820 --> 00:67:13.110
Mm. Hence the title, I think they both

1171
00:67:13.119 --> 00:67:15.800
end up being killed. Um, but, you

1172
00:67:15.809 --> 00:67:15.989
know, they do, they both end up being

1173
00:67:16.000 --> 00:67:20.239
killed but they make her choose which is, you

1174
00:67:20.250 --> 00:67:23.128
can, I mean, for a mother that is

1175
00:67:23.139 --> 00:67:30.409
like, it is so horrific to imagine yourself in

1176
00:67:30.418 --> 00:67:35.829
that situation that you wanna look away because it's like

1177
00:67:35.840 --> 00:67:39.918
, and III, I don't, I don't even

1178
00:67:39.929 --> 00:67:42.739
know. I don't, I mean, it would

1179
00:67:42.750 --> 00:67:45.309
, it would be hard for me to imagine uh

1180
00:67:45.320 --> 00:67:47.570
, a woman being able to write it. Not

1181
00:67:47.929 --> 00:67:50.849
because she wouldn't have the skill, but it's,

1182
00:67:54.378 --> 00:67:58.289
you would almost need that the detachment of a man

1183
00:67:58.300 --> 00:68:00.719
to write that. Not that a man is detached

1184
00:68:00.728 --> 00:68:02.599
from his Children. That's not what I mean.

1185
00:68:02.760 --> 00:68:04.590
But it is just, I mean, I can

1186
00:68:04.599 --> 00:68:06.500
tell you as a, as a parent, it's

1187
00:68:06.510 --> 00:68:14.219
so like, mm, it's a whole body experience

1188
00:68:15.128 --> 00:68:18.208
. Um I can still like, II, I

1189
00:68:18.220 --> 00:68:25.359
can still physically conjure the um the, the feeling

1190
00:68:25.369 --> 00:68:27.259
that I would get when my child was hungry.

1191
00:68:28.470 --> 00:68:32.699
Yeah. And again, I mean, ii,

1192
00:68:32.708 --> 00:68:34.708
I certainly think a woman could write that. I'm

1193
00:68:34.720 --> 00:68:40.548
not saying that she couldn't. But uh uh I

1194
00:68:40.560 --> 00:68:45.739
mean, thyroid just did it so, so brilliantly

1195
00:68:45.750 --> 00:68:54.418
, you know, and that was fascinating and tragic

1196
00:68:54.430 --> 00:69:00.069
and horrifying and beautiful. OK. So let me

1197
00:69:00.079 --> 00:69:03.520
try to put it another way and then perhaps I

1198
00:69:03.529 --> 00:69:10.479
can give a few examples of mine. Are there

1199
00:69:10.489 --> 00:69:16.399
any stories in books, movies or any other kind

1200
00:69:16.409 --> 00:69:21.859
of medium that you've read, watched? And uh

1201
00:69:21.869 --> 00:69:26.619
after the fact you thought to yourself, OK.

1202
00:69:26.628 --> 00:69:30.588
So even if this is a great story because of

1203
00:69:30.600 --> 00:69:35.250
the way things are depicted, I don't feel uh

1204
00:69:35.640 --> 00:69:42.279
is recommending, recommending it to other people. Have

1205
00:69:42.289 --> 00:69:45.199
you ever had something like that or? I've,

1206
00:69:45.208 --> 00:69:53.449
I've, I'm not sure I put it quite that

1207
00:69:53.458 --> 00:69:55.378
way. Like, I mean, there's certainly stories

1208
00:69:55.390 --> 00:69:58.588
where I disagreed with the premise, maybe with their

1209
00:69:58.600 --> 00:70:02.390
historical premise or with a moral ambiguity that, um

1210
00:70:02.399 --> 00:70:09.569
, that, that the story, um, depicted

1211
00:70:09.579 --> 00:70:11.958
, you know, I definitely, but I would

1212
00:70:11.970 --> 00:70:13.939
never, I don't think there, that I would

1213
00:70:13.949 --> 00:70:15.739
ever go so far as to say, um,

1214
00:70:16.829 --> 00:70:18.539
well, don't read that because of it where I

1215
00:70:18.548 --> 00:70:20.229
wouldn't recommend it. I'd, I'd say, well

1216
00:70:20.239 --> 00:70:23.220
, it's interesting but here's what I think, you

1217
00:70:23.229 --> 00:70:29.319
know. Um I, so I guess I don't

1218
00:70:29.338 --> 00:70:30.970
, my answer is, I don't think so.

1219
00:70:30.979 --> 00:70:34.289
I can't, I can't conjure something, you know

1220
00:70:36.500 --> 00:70:39.509
, a memory of a time when I've, when

1221
00:70:39.520 --> 00:70:43.838
I've read something and said I'm so offended by this

1222
00:70:43.850 --> 00:70:46.890
. I think it shouldn't be or I would,

1223
00:70:46.899 --> 00:70:50.479
I would discourage people from reading it. I told

1224
00:70:50.539 --> 00:70:55.878
people when something really sucked, you know. Yeah

1225
00:70:55.949 --> 00:70:58.119
. But, but that's, that's a different,

1226
00:70:58.449 --> 00:71:01.140
that's a different kind of thing. But uh I

1227
00:71:01.149 --> 00:71:08.600
wasn't thinking perhaps uh so much as being offended,

1228
00:71:08.609 --> 00:71:14.449
but perhaps more as OK, so perhaps the guy

1229
00:71:14.458 --> 00:71:18.439
here, the creator went too far in terms of

1230
00:71:19.020 --> 00:71:24.500
the, the things graphically. And uh I mean

1231
00:71:24.509 --> 00:71:29.039
, I don't think I would feel well recommending the

1232
00:71:29.048 --> 00:71:31.039
II, I was able to go through it.

1233
00:71:31.048 --> 00:71:34.180
I still think it's a good story, but I

1234
00:71:34.189 --> 00:71:39.619
wouldn't feel well recommending this to anyone because even if

1235
00:71:39.628 --> 00:71:43.039
the story is good, I don't think that people

1236
00:71:43.048 --> 00:71:46.430
would be particularly enriched by being exposed to it.

1237
00:71:46.439 --> 00:71:49.939
Something like that. I, I can't, I

1238
00:71:49.949 --> 00:71:54.619
can't come up with an example of that. I

1239
00:71:54.628 --> 00:71:56.829
mean, if, if, if I felt that

1240
00:71:56.838 --> 00:72:01.119
I don't remember, I don't remember the story and

1241
00:72:01.128 --> 00:72:03.298
I think I would probably, if I felt so

1242
00:72:03.310 --> 00:72:05.168
strongly about something I don't think so. Have you

1243
00:72:05.180 --> 00:72:06.729
like, is there a story that you've read where

1244
00:72:06.739 --> 00:72:09.930
you're like, wow, he, he or she

1245
00:72:09.939 --> 00:72:12.850
should not have gone there? That was too much

1246
00:72:13.079 --> 00:72:15.350
? Ok. So I'm going to explain to you

1247
00:72:15.359 --> 00:72:18.409
what happened here over the course of my life basically

1248
00:72:18.418 --> 00:72:23.250
. So probably until 10 years ago, I was

1249
00:72:23.259 --> 00:72:26.680
one of those people that was like, ok,

1250
00:72:26.689 --> 00:72:30.180
so you should be exposed to great art of,

1251
00:72:30.189 --> 00:72:33.989
of any kind. And it doesn't matter if it

1252
00:72:34.208 --> 00:72:38.989
makes you feel unwell, if it makes you feel

1253
00:72:39.000 --> 00:72:42.539
a little bit sick, even if it's good art

1254
00:72:42.548 --> 00:72:45.689
, you should be exposed to it. But then

1255
00:72:45.109 --> 00:72:49.729
, um, for example, uh I watched the

1256
00:72:49.739 --> 00:72:54.020
anti-christ by Lars Von Drier. I don't know if

1257
00:72:54.029 --> 00:72:57.918
you ever watched that one. Uh And I was

1258
00:72:57.930 --> 00:73:00.739
like, I mean, it was very hard to

1259
00:73:00.750 --> 00:73:03.140
go through it, particularly the last 20 minutes or

1260
00:73:03.149 --> 00:73:06.020
something like that. But I went through it and

1261
00:73:06.029 --> 00:73:09.259
I, I mean, I've never had myself,

1262
00:73:09.270 --> 00:73:11.970
uh, I, I was never exposed to any

1263
00:73:11.979 --> 00:73:15.180
story where I was like, ok, so I

1264
00:73:15.189 --> 00:73:16.819
have to stop here. I can't go further.

1265
00:73:16.829 --> 00:73:19.048
I can't take it anymore. That, that never

1266
00:73:19.060 --> 00:73:23.270
happened to me personally. But then I tried to

1267
00:73:23.279 --> 00:73:26.949
show to watch it together with a couple of friends

1268
00:73:26.958 --> 00:73:30.869
from university back then. And one of them accidentally

1269
00:73:30.878 --> 00:73:35.720
accidentally skipped the movie to one of the most violent

1270
00:73:35.729 --> 00:73:39.470
scenes. And they were like, man, I

1271
00:73:39.479 --> 00:73:40.909
, I can, I can, I can,

1272
00:73:40.918 --> 00:73:44.529
I can't watch it. Sorry. Uh Look,

1273
00:73:44.539 --> 00:73:46.750
this is just too much and then the same thing

1274
00:73:46.759 --> 00:73:50.189
happened, uh when I tried to show, for

1275
00:73:50.199 --> 00:73:54.810
example, my mother, a couple of movies that

1276
00:73:54.819 --> 00:73:59.569
for this or that reason, she uh uh she

1277
00:73:59.579 --> 00:74:02.470
doesn't like the uh I mean, to see certain

1278
00:74:02.479 --> 00:74:05.208
kinds of things. And then, I mean,

1279
00:74:05.838 --> 00:74:11.720
uh over time I got to a point where I

1280
00:74:11.729 --> 00:74:15.729
sort of became more sensitive to the idea that perhaps

1281
00:74:15.739 --> 00:74:20.619
there are certain kinds of graphic things, perhaps not

1282
00:74:20.628 --> 00:74:24.949
so much in books, but in movies because you

1283
00:74:24.958 --> 00:74:30.350
actually see the stuff that that's happening there where I

1284
00:74:30.359 --> 00:74:33.088
, I mean, I, there are certain things

1285
00:74:33.100 --> 00:74:40.838
that I really hesitate to recommend to other people because

1286
00:74:40.869 --> 00:74:44.668
one thing that I think about now that I didn't

1287
00:74:44.680 --> 00:74:49.270
consider before 10 years ago or so is OK,

1288
00:74:49.279 --> 00:74:56.149
so this is a good story but is it really

1289
00:74:56.159 --> 00:75:00.279
worth it for someone to be exposed to it?

1290
00:75:00.289 --> 00:75:04.500
I mean, if someone is not and never watches

1291
00:75:04.509 --> 00:75:09.668
this, uh are they, would they be missing

1292
00:75:10.039 --> 00:75:12.489
on something, you know, and and, and

1293
00:75:12.500 --> 00:75:14.750
now I, and now I think like that and

1294
00:75:14.759 --> 00:75:16.850
there, and for example, the anti-christ is one

1295
00:75:16.859 --> 00:75:24.359
of those movies. Uh The adaptation of 120 Days

1296
00:75:24.369 --> 00:75:29.399
of Sodom by Pierre Paolo Paolini is another one of

1297
00:75:29.409 --> 00:75:33.649
those movies because of the sexual perversion and all of

1298
00:75:33.659 --> 00:75:36.409
that. Uh and there are, there are perhaps

1299
00:75:36.418 --> 00:75:38.930
a couple more, I mean, it, the

1300
00:75:38.939 --> 00:75:42.909
list is still very small, at least the ones

1301
00:75:42.918 --> 00:75:45.579
, the ones that immediately come to mind. But

1302
00:75:45.720 --> 00:75:47.539
now I have, uh, uh, at least

1303
00:75:47.548 --> 00:75:54.509
a small list of things that look and unless people

1304
00:75:54.520 --> 00:76:00.259
ask me directly about them, I basically never mention

1305
00:76:00.270 --> 00:76:04.180
them to anyone who is not at least familiar with

1306
00:76:04.189 --> 00:76:09.619
the existence of that movie. For example. II

1307
00:76:09.628 --> 00:76:12.220
, I hear what you're saying. I, um

1308
00:76:13.470 --> 00:76:17.529
, I think probably in my case, um,

1309
00:76:18.100 --> 00:76:21.479
I, I tend to kind of do a pre

1310
00:76:21.489 --> 00:76:27.208
emptive strike and I, I will avoid something that

1311
00:76:27.220 --> 00:76:31.149
is that I just know I don't wanna see.

1312
00:76:32.088 --> 00:76:35.020
Um, I mean, a good example is,

1313
00:76:35.319 --> 00:76:38.168
and I'm not, I'm really not that big a

1314
00:76:38.180 --> 00:76:40.689
horror fan but II, I think my son probably

1315
00:76:40.699 --> 00:76:43.189
would have watched this with, would have enjoyed watching

1316
00:76:43.199 --> 00:76:45.819
it with me. There's a series called Saw.

1317
00:76:46.359 --> 00:76:48.859
Yeah. Yeah. And it's that I've, I've

1318
00:76:48.869 --> 00:76:51.560
watched, I've watched the movie. I know that's

1319
00:76:51.569 --> 00:76:54.439
not for me. I've never seen a single one

1320
00:76:54.449 --> 00:76:57.789
of them so I'm not gonna judge but I know

1321
00:76:57.798 --> 00:77:01.168
that's not for me. But what's really interesting to

1322
00:77:01.180 --> 00:77:04.060
me is, for instance, you know, I'm

1323
00:77:06.779 --> 00:77:09.270
the movie The Exorcist. I mean, granted I

1324
00:77:09.279 --> 00:77:11.289
grew up Catholic, I went to Catholic schools,

1325
00:77:11.298 --> 00:77:13.649
you know, but the movie The Exorcist was so

1326
00:77:13.659 --> 00:77:15.729
terrifying to me when I was a kid that I

1327
00:77:15.739 --> 00:77:17.500
had nightmares about it into adulthood. I mean,

1328
00:77:17.509 --> 00:77:24.699
well into adulthood and my, you know, 16

1329
00:77:24.708 --> 00:77:28.199
year old daughter who I think first saw the original

1330
00:77:28.208 --> 00:77:30.458
Exorcist, um, when she was a really little

1331
00:77:30.470 --> 00:77:32.220
kid, all three of my kids have seen it

1332
00:77:32.229 --> 00:77:35.520
. They think it's hilarious. I mean, hilarious

1333
00:77:36.560 --> 00:77:40.628
. And they, they think that part where she

1334
00:77:40.838 --> 00:77:43.359
throws up the pea soup is one of the funniest

1335
00:77:43.369 --> 00:77:45.619
things they've ever seen. They think the special effects

1336
00:77:45.628 --> 00:77:48.668
are terrible. I mean, the, that movie

1337
00:77:48.680 --> 00:77:53.798
does not give them nightmares but a little bit.

1338
00:77:54.000 --> 00:78:00.020
But wait a minute if they watched the scary movies

1339
00:78:00.029 --> 00:78:04.100
before watching The Exorcist because if they did, because

1340
00:78:04.109 --> 00:78:08.338
if they did it's easier to understand why they would

1341
00:78:08.350 --> 00:78:12.000
laugh because Scary Movie two is all about right with

1342
00:78:12.009 --> 00:78:14.140
James Woods and, yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

1343
00:78:14.189 --> 00:78:16.000
I've seen that. Exactly. Um, maybe,

1344
00:78:16.009 --> 00:78:19.168
but I think also they genuinely think it's a funny

1345
00:78:19.180 --> 00:78:21.329
movie. I mean, I think they genuinely think

1346
00:78:21.338 --> 00:78:25.878
it's kind of like, like when her head spins

1347
00:78:25.890 --> 00:78:29.958
around, you know, that was, that was

1348
00:78:29.970 --> 00:78:31.270
so disturbing to me as a kid to watch that

1349
00:78:31.279 --> 00:78:34.770
. It was absolutely horrific and to them they're like

1350
00:78:34.779 --> 00:78:38.989
, that is so obviously not real, you know

1351
00:78:39.000 --> 00:78:41.319
, what I mean? And they just think it's

1352
00:78:41.329 --> 00:78:45.930
funny and, um, uh, so it,

1353
00:78:45.939 --> 00:78:50.239
it, it, I'm, I'm always intrigued by

1354
00:78:50.250 --> 00:78:55.479
people who are really into horror in this way and

1355
00:78:55.489 --> 00:79:00.119
they don't mind watching people get hacked to death and

1356
00:79:00.378 --> 00:79:06.208
they are completely able to separate, um, what

1357
00:79:06.220 --> 00:79:11.220
they're watching with real life, you know, and

1358
00:79:11.229 --> 00:79:14.449
be like mom, it's not real, don't you

1359
00:79:14.458 --> 00:79:16.250
get it? It's not real. And whereas to

1360
00:79:16.259 --> 00:79:18.029
me I'm watching it and I'm like, I know

1361
00:79:18.039 --> 00:79:20.649
it's not real but it feels real. You know

1362
00:79:20.939 --> 00:79:24.798
, I can see it and then I'm imagining this

1363
00:79:24.810 --> 00:79:28.759
in my own life, but not everybody feels that

1364
00:79:28.770 --> 00:79:30.588
way and they're, they're able to make that separation

1365
00:79:30.600 --> 00:79:32.418
. I'm not one of those people. I,

1366
00:79:32.430 --> 00:79:34.009
uh, you know, it's why I'm not,

1367
00:79:34.020 --> 00:79:36.069
I mean, I love a great horror movie.

1368
00:79:36.079 --> 00:79:38.750
I mean, I think we've talked about this,

1369
00:79:38.759 --> 00:79:42.310
that the novel Dracula is one of my favorite novels

1370
00:79:42.319 --> 00:79:43.930
of all time. I think it's so good.

1371
00:79:43.939 --> 00:79:45.009
Well, I think the character is so good.

1372
00:79:45.378 --> 00:79:51.279
Um, but I, I, you know,

1373
00:79:51.289 --> 00:79:57.338
I could not be one of those people who loves

1374
00:79:57.350 --> 00:80:00.298
horror and can watch saw and, you know,

1375
00:80:00.310 --> 00:80:03.140
uh, the conjuring and something, you know,

1376
00:80:03.149 --> 00:80:06.458
some other horrific thing back to back or like those

1377
00:80:06.470 --> 00:80:10.699
simulated snuff movies that I think that is really horrific

1378
00:80:10.708 --> 00:80:12.359
. To me, the idea, even if it's

1379
00:80:12.369 --> 00:80:15.430
, if it's acted out on film and it's not

1380
00:80:15.489 --> 00:80:18.579
real. And the idea of Snuff is, that's

1381
00:80:18.588 --> 00:80:23.060
probably where I would just wanna throw up. Yeah

1382
00:80:23.619 --> 00:80:25.250
, that makes sense. Now, look, uh

1383
00:80:26.350 --> 00:80:30.548
, horror, horror movies. Uh, it,

1384
00:80:30.750 --> 00:80:31.729
it, it might be weird but, uh,

1385
00:80:31.739 --> 00:80:35.439
even when it comes to the list of movies that

1386
00:80:35.449 --> 00:80:40.259
I don't recommend to anyone, not one of them

1387
00:80:40.270 --> 00:80:42.798
, apart from perhaps the anti-christ, I'm not sure

1388
00:80:42.810 --> 00:80:45.418
if it's classified as a horror movie or not.

1389
00:80:45.430 --> 00:80:48.520
But apart from that one, there's not one single

1390
00:80:48.529 --> 00:80:51.668
horror movie there. So horror movies, I,

1391
00:80:51.680 --> 00:80:55.529
I don't say that I'm a horror movie fan.

1392
00:80:55.539 --> 00:81:00.180
I've watched a ton of them just because until,

1393
00:81:00.189 --> 00:81:02.949
until a few years ago I was addicted to movies

1394
00:81:02.958 --> 00:81:06.850
. And so I've watched everything out there, even

1395
00:81:06.859 --> 00:81:13.470
the 19 eighties slasher movies, I've watched all of

1396
00:81:13.479 --> 00:81:15.458
them and most of them do not bother me at

1397
00:81:15.470 --> 00:81:18.208
all. Some of them make me feel a little

1398
00:81:18.220 --> 00:81:23.088
bit uneasy but not sick nor anything like that.

1399
00:81:23.399 --> 00:81:24.668
So, but, but I, I'm not,

1400
00:81:24.680 --> 00:81:28.640
I wouldn't say I'm a horror movie fan but,

1401
00:81:28.689 --> 00:81:30.009
uh, I, I mean, I guess that

1402
00:81:30.020 --> 00:81:32.060
the things that perhaps when it comes to recommending them

1403
00:81:32.069 --> 00:81:35.649
to other people bother me the most. It's when

1404
00:81:35.659 --> 00:81:42.890
it, it involves things that can actually happen realistically

1405
00:81:42.899 --> 00:81:45.359
in real life, you know, like, like

1406
00:81:45.369 --> 00:81:49.560
for example, what happens in the anti-christ that could

1407
00:81:49.569 --> 00:81:57.229
happen in real life, the sexual perversions in 120

1408
00:81:57.239 --> 00:82:01.189
days of sodom and uh uh uh uh oh,

1409
00:82:01.430 --> 00:82:08.930
have you watched here Irreversible By Gaspar Noe with Monica

1410
00:82:08.939 --> 00:82:15.838
Bellucci uh yeah, so that movie involves uh a

1411
00:82:15.739 --> 00:82:21.708
, a very hard to go through rapes in,

1412
00:82:23.168 --> 00:82:24.649
I mean, that would be, that would be

1413
00:82:24.659 --> 00:82:26.689
difficult. I mean, I, I would never

1414
00:82:26.699 --> 00:82:28.140
go so far as to say, you know,

1415
00:82:28.149 --> 00:82:30.020
that, that it shouldn't be a movie or anything

1416
00:82:30.029 --> 00:82:31.850
like that, but there are definitely things that I

1417
00:82:31.859 --> 00:82:35.409
would avoid because to me they don't have value and

1418
00:82:35.819 --> 00:82:39.489
, and for example, just a few minutes ago

1419
00:82:39.500 --> 00:82:42.154
I mentioned Tony. So I know and in the

1420
00:82:42.164 --> 00:82:44.664
Sopranos, there's also a rape scene. I don't

1421
00:82:44.673 --> 00:82:45.963
know if you remember this. But there's one episode

1422
00:82:45.975 --> 00:82:53.015
where his female therapist is uh leaving her office and

1423
00:82:53.024 --> 00:82:55.444
she's raped by a guy. I can't remember exactly

1424
00:82:55.454 --> 00:82:57.944
who the guy was. And I think that Tony

1425
00:82:57.954 --> 00:83:01.604
Soprano eventually gets across that and kills the guy.

1426
00:83:01.614 --> 00:83:04.444
Iii I can't remember. I can't remember exactly.

1427
00:83:04.454 --> 00:83:09.489
But uh I mean, uh that 10 of course

1428
00:83:09.500 --> 00:83:13.329
, it's always hard to watch those kinds of scenes

1429
00:83:13.338 --> 00:83:15.369
. Always, at least for me personally, it's

1430
00:83:15.378 --> 00:83:18.430
always because I, I feel my blood boiling because

1431
00:83:18.439 --> 00:83:24.378
I get really angry just imagining something like that happening

1432
00:83:24.390 --> 00:83:27.259
in front of me. And it really messes me

1433
00:83:27.270 --> 00:83:30.378
up at least for a few minutes. But that

1434
00:83:30.390 --> 00:83:34.119
one actually, I don't have any problem recommending the

1435
00:83:34.128 --> 00:83:39.560
entire Sopranos series to anyone even with that scene and

1436
00:83:39.569 --> 00:83:42.208
with other stuff, I don't have any problem at

1437
00:83:42.220 --> 00:83:46.708
all, but irreversible. I think that they just

1438
00:83:46.720 --> 00:83:48.789
went too far there. I mean, even I

1439
00:83:48.798 --> 00:83:53.470
, myself, I watched the movie once and I

1440
00:83:53.479 --> 00:83:57.689
can't watch the movie again ever again. So I

1441
00:83:57.770 --> 00:84:00.979
think probably for me what is, what would be

1442
00:84:01.109 --> 00:84:09.680
, uh, a line crosser is if a movie

1443
00:84:09.739 --> 00:84:15.168
was too nihilistic, um, and cease to have

1444
00:84:15.180 --> 00:84:20.859
any moral dimension because I think, I think our

1445
00:84:20.869 --> 00:84:24.430
lives have a moral dimension, you know, and

1446
00:84:25.119 --> 00:84:31.079
, and I, it's also just deeply disturbing to

1447
00:84:31.088 --> 00:84:34.329
watch something like that and be able to, um

1448
00:84:38.220 --> 00:84:42.529
, uh, be able to take any value from

1449
00:84:42.539 --> 00:84:44.319
that and apply it to my own life, which

1450
00:84:44.329 --> 00:84:45.918
I think is why I read and it's why I

1451
00:84:45.930 --> 00:84:47.890
write. It's why I watch movies. I mean

1452
00:84:47.899 --> 00:84:49.838
, ultimately it's why I consume art. It's to

1453
00:84:49.850 --> 00:84:54.149
be, um, enriched in some way. And

1454
00:84:54.159 --> 00:84:57.439
if I don't find it enriching, it's funny you

1455
00:84:57.449 --> 00:84:59.750
should mention The Sopranos because I too would recommend that

1456
00:84:59.759 --> 00:85:01.168
series to anyone. But I remember when I stopped

1457
00:85:01.180 --> 00:85:06.359
watching it, um, and I, I may

1458
00:85:06.369 --> 00:85:10.640
have been pregnant at the time. It's kind of

1459
00:85:10.649 --> 00:85:13.479
funny because when I'm, when, whenever I was

1460
00:85:13.489 --> 00:85:15.500
, I was pregnant, there were certain things I

1461
00:85:15.509 --> 00:85:17.270
could not watch and I could not, I mean

1462
00:85:17.279 --> 00:85:18.869
, I just couldn't, I mean, I,

1463
00:85:18.878 --> 00:85:21.668
I remember in one of my pregnancies kill Bill came

1464
00:85:21.680 --> 00:85:24.079
out, by the way, I love Kill Bill

1465
00:85:24.088 --> 00:85:26.390
. I watch it now. You know what I

1466
00:85:26.399 --> 00:85:28.409
mean? I couldn't watch it. I mean,

1467
00:85:28.418 --> 00:85:31.199
I couldn't, and, um, I remember an

1468
00:85:31.208 --> 00:85:34.939
episode of The Sopranos and I I have not from

1469
00:85:34.949 --> 00:85:38.619
that episode on, I, I never finished the

1470
00:85:38.628 --> 00:85:44.470
series. It was a young woman who was a

1471
00:85:44.479 --> 00:85:48.319
stripper at one of Tony's clubs and she was pregnant

1472
00:85:48.329 --> 00:85:50.789
with this awful guy's kid and he beat her to

1473
00:85:50.798 --> 00:85:57.168
death. Do you remember the scene? That was

1474
00:85:57.180 --> 00:86:00.470
so disturbing to me that, and I knew that

1475
00:86:00.479 --> 00:86:01.689
that guy was eventually gonna get it. You know

1476
00:86:01.699 --> 00:86:03.890
, there, there was a moral dimension to the

1477
00:86:03.899 --> 00:86:08.529
Sopranos actually. You know, but I, I'm

1478
00:86:08.970 --> 00:86:11.109
pretty sure I was pregnant when I watched that.

1479
00:86:11.418 --> 00:86:15.100
Um, because I, I just couldn't, you

1480
00:86:15.109 --> 00:86:17.708
know, I just couldn't go beyond that. Um

1481
00:86:19.159 --> 00:86:21.000
, and not in a judgmental way. I,

1482
00:86:21.009 --> 00:86:24.779
I just couldn't watch it because it, you know

1483
00:86:24.850 --> 00:86:29.189
, it was so, uh, it was disturbing

1484
00:86:29.199 --> 00:86:31.619
to me on, on such a deep level.

1485
00:86:33.079 --> 00:86:35.850
Ok. So, II I made me physically ill

1486
00:86:35.859 --> 00:86:38.838
. I mean, I remember it made me physically

1487
00:86:38.850 --> 00:86:42.659
ill. Yeah. OK. So perhaps, uh

1488
00:86:43.470 --> 00:86:46.708
, 01 of the things that bother me when it

1489
00:86:46.720 --> 00:86:55.470
comes to how certain things are sometimes depicted is if

1490
00:86:55.479 --> 00:86:59.199
you really need to do it that way or go

1491
00:86:59.208 --> 00:87:00.699
that far because for example, in the Sopranos,

1492
00:87:00.708 --> 00:87:04.878
the rape scene, you see some of it,

1493
00:87:04.890 --> 00:87:09.378
but most of it is suggested, you know,

1494
00:87:10.810 --> 00:87:15.189
in irreversible, it's not suggested at all. I

1495
00:87:15.208 --> 00:87:19.239
don't think it's all there. And one thing that

1496
00:87:19.250 --> 00:87:23.789
bothers me about that, it's not just the morality

1497
00:87:23.798 --> 00:87:26.100
of it, but I, I, in,

1498
00:87:26.109 --> 00:87:30.600
I wonder whether it's telling me that perhaps the author

1499
00:87:30.609 --> 00:87:34.020
, the director, the writer, whoever is not

1500
00:87:34.029 --> 00:87:39.298
that great at directing or writing because for, for

1501
00:87:39.310 --> 00:87:44.020
me, someone who's really good at, uh for

1502
00:87:44.029 --> 00:87:46.798
example, making, making someone feeling disgusted at the

1503
00:87:46.810 --> 00:87:51.529
rape scene does not have to show it all the

1504
00:87:51.958 --> 00:87:55.119
, I agree. I, I, and I

1505
00:87:55.128 --> 00:87:56.798
, and I, and I think the level of

1506
00:87:56.810 --> 00:87:59.729
disgust and I think it, and I think someone

1507
00:87:59.739 --> 00:88:01.939
is a better writer if, uh for example,

1508
00:88:01.949 --> 00:88:05.399
when it comes to books or, I mean,

1509
00:88:05.409 --> 00:88:10.548
there's that idea of you show don't tell, right

1510
00:88:10.560 --> 00:88:12.869
show don't tell. In the case of movies,

1511
00:88:12.878 --> 00:88:17.659
I would say because it's all showing uh you show

1512
00:88:18.509 --> 00:88:20.810
but not too much. Are you sure? But

1513
00:88:20.819 --> 00:88:25.958
you're not uh describe, I mean, in,

1514
00:88:25.970 --> 00:88:29.359
in that case, it's not describing but it's showing

1515
00:88:29.619 --> 00:88:33.009
uh everything down, down to the details. Uh

1516
00:88:33.759 --> 00:88:35.789
I agree with that and I, and I,

1517
00:88:35.798 --> 00:88:40.239
and I think that perhaps there are times that's just

1518
00:88:40.399 --> 00:88:43.039
too much, it's not needed. It's, it's

1519
00:88:43.048 --> 00:88:46.509
just that's not needed to convey the same kind of

1520
00:88:46.520 --> 00:88:48.720
, or, or to create the same kind of

1521
00:88:48.729 --> 00:88:54.798
reaction in viewers or readers. I would agree with

1522
00:88:54.810 --> 00:88:56.600
that. I mean, it's funny, I was

1523
00:88:56.609 --> 00:89:00.939
talking about this with, um, with a writer

1524
00:89:00.949 --> 00:89:04.279
friend. Uh This is some time ago but when

1525
00:89:04.289 --> 00:89:11.520
uh I sat down to write um this historical fantasy

1526
00:89:11.529 --> 00:89:15.009
series, uh breath some years ago when I started

1527
00:89:15.020 --> 00:89:15.789
it, um you know, it has a,

1528
00:89:15.798 --> 00:89:21.548
a, a central love story to it. And

1529
00:89:21.579 --> 00:89:24.609
at, you know, at the time, and

1530
00:89:24.619 --> 00:89:28.838
I think this is largely still the case, really

1531
00:89:29.220 --> 00:89:31.949
kind of explicit love scenes had made their way into

1532
00:89:31.958 --> 00:89:36.020
just about every genre historical fiction. And, you

1533
00:89:36.029 --> 00:89:38.909
know, it, it had, you know,

1534
00:89:39.250 --> 00:89:42.979
left the confines of erotica and it was in science

1535
00:89:42.989 --> 00:89:44.939
fiction, it was in historical fiction, it was

1536
00:89:44.949 --> 00:89:46.159
in, in pretty much every kind of fiction.

1537
00:89:46.409 --> 00:89:50.039
And I decided that I was not gonna do that

1538
00:89:50.369 --> 00:89:53.680
. I decided that I was gonna have a very

1539
00:89:53.689 --> 00:89:58.109
sensual love story and have it be, um,

1540
00:89:59.659 --> 00:90:01.560
you know, hopefully very emotional and very compelling,

1541
00:90:01.750 --> 00:90:04.470
but that I, that I was gonna have a

1542
00:90:04.479 --> 00:90:12.810
fade to black approach. And I'm glad I did

1543
00:90:12.819 --> 00:90:15.409
that because I'm, I'm for one, I'm really

1544
00:90:15.418 --> 00:90:18.970
sick of being bombarded by explicit love scenes at this

1545
00:90:18.979 --> 00:90:24.199
point. I feel like, um they're just there

1546
00:90:30.319 --> 00:90:31.399
because I don't know, maybe the writer feels like

1547
00:90:31.409 --> 00:90:33.409
they need to put it in there to attract the

1548
00:90:33.418 --> 00:90:36.720
reader's attention. Um And that we just keep having

1549
00:90:36.729 --> 00:90:41.069
to up the ante with these scenes and with these

1550
00:90:41.079 --> 00:90:44.739
stories because it's now it's just not enough to have

1551
00:90:44.750 --> 00:90:47.298
, you know, a passionate kiss or even like

1552
00:90:47.310 --> 00:90:49.418
, or, or even, you know, regular

1553
00:90:49.430 --> 00:90:56.208
sort of um sex that doesn't involve all sorts of

1554
00:90:56.220 --> 00:91:00.159
tricks. And after a certain point, it's like

1555
00:91:00.168 --> 00:91:01.000
, really, I, I mean, it,

1556
00:91:01.009 --> 00:91:02.619
it's sort of like when, you know, that

1557
00:91:02.628 --> 00:91:05.739
the James Bond franchise has to scale back, you

1558
00:91:05.750 --> 00:91:08.819
know, like with the Roger Moore ones when they

1559
00:91:08.829 --> 00:91:10.918
started going to space and all this stuff, it's

1560
00:91:10.930 --> 00:91:13.168
like, no. Yeah. And they've kind of

1561
00:91:13.180 --> 00:91:15.159
got to bring it back to a place where look

1562
00:91:15.168 --> 00:91:17.759
, ok, now he's just using his fists and

1563
00:91:17.770 --> 00:91:19.954
his gun. He's not gonna be in space.

1564
00:91:19.963 --> 00:91:23.375
He's not gonna be doing anything, you know,

1565
00:91:23.384 --> 00:91:25.375
we're not going to be going to the paranormal.

1566
00:91:25.384 --> 00:91:28.604
We're not gonna make him do things that, that

1567
00:91:28.614 --> 00:91:31.364
don't in any way seem realistic for this, you

1568
00:91:31.375 --> 00:91:33.534
know, and now 56 year old man for God's

1569
00:91:33.543 --> 00:91:39.329
sake with bad knees probably. Um So I,

1570
00:91:39.899 --> 00:91:43.619
you know, that's, that's something that I,

1571
00:91:43.628 --> 00:91:45.390
that, that I've come to feel strongly about.

1572
00:91:45.399 --> 00:91:50.739
I think that um I think that the depiction of

1573
00:91:50.750 --> 00:91:55.180
sex has just gotten ridiculous, but in a lot

1574
00:91:55.208 --> 00:91:57.149
of, a lot of stories and not because I'm

1575
00:91:57.159 --> 00:91:59.649
prudish about it. It's, I'm not, it's

1576
00:91:59.659 --> 00:92:00.829
just I'm bored by it, you know, and

1577
00:92:00.838 --> 00:92:03.949
, and I feel like we're constantly having to add

1578
00:92:03.958 --> 00:92:06.939
more whipped cream and more cherries and more chocolate sauce

1579
00:92:06.949 --> 00:92:11.338
and more peanut sprinkles and then the colorful confetti sprinkles

1580
00:92:13.039 --> 00:92:14.979
. Yeah. No, but, but, but

1581
00:92:14.989 --> 00:92:17.048
you know what, when it comes to uh love

1582
00:92:17.060 --> 00:92:20.180
scenes, sex scenes, whatever, I mean,

1583
00:92:20.470 --> 00:92:26.329
I don't have a particular problem uh in the way

1584
00:92:26.338 --> 00:92:30.890
they are graphically depicted in more or less detail.

1585
00:92:30.899 --> 00:92:32.939
I mean, perhaps sometimes I would say, OK

1586
00:92:32.949 --> 00:92:36.449
, so this is perhaps uh no longer just a

1587
00:92:36.458 --> 00:92:42.034
romance novel, this is perhaps already pornography or something

1588
00:92:42.043 --> 00:92:45.234
like that. But if people are into pornography fine

1589
00:92:45.364 --> 00:92:46.333
, I mean, I don't, I don't,

1590
00:92:46.765 --> 00:92:48.875
I don't have a moral problem with it in that

1591
00:92:48.884 --> 00:92:50.555
regard. I don't have, I'm not prudish about

1592
00:92:50.564 --> 00:92:54.444
it. But the, the thing, for example

1593
00:92:54.454 --> 00:92:58.435
, about irreversible and 120 days of sodom is that

1594
00:92:59.250 --> 00:93:01.310
, I mean, in 120 days of sodom,

1595
00:93:01.319 --> 00:93:05.829
I mean, it involves things that I wouldn't even

1596
00:93:05.838 --> 00:93:09.649
mention here because this will also be on youtube.

1597
00:93:09.659 --> 00:93:13.970
And it's just too much just to say that it's

1598
00:93:13.979 --> 00:93:17.109
too much, even for people that watch regular porn

1599
00:93:17.359 --> 00:93:24.930
, it's just too much because it goes beyond gratuitous

1600
00:93:25.048 --> 00:93:27.819
. Yeah. And the, and then, and

1601
00:93:27.829 --> 00:93:30.039
then adding, yeah, and then adding the ribs

1602
00:93:30.180 --> 00:93:33.680
in an irreversible, I mean, sometimes I find

1603
00:93:33.689 --> 00:93:40.310
myself asking, I mean, isn't this wrong?

1604
00:93:40.319 --> 00:93:42.838
I mean, and by wrong, I'm not sure

1605
00:93:42.850 --> 00:93:47.039
if I mean, morally wrong or artistically wrong either

1606
00:93:47.048 --> 00:93:54.680
because perhaps you shouldn't expose people to so much graphic

1607
00:93:54.970 --> 00:93:58.668
stuff because it, it feels sort of wrong or

1608
00:93:58.680 --> 00:94:00.750
because as an artist, you don't need to go

1609
00:94:00.759 --> 00:94:03.789
that far. And so perhaps you're not as great

1610
00:94:03.798 --> 00:94:08.119
an artist as you think you are or as you

1611
00:94:08.128 --> 00:94:10.449
could be. And, and, and another thing

1612
00:94:10.458 --> 00:94:14.168
that comes to mind and that when I really straight

1613
00:94:14.180 --> 00:94:17.039
out say that it's morally or was morally wrong,

1614
00:94:17.048 --> 00:94:20.298
for example, back in 20 I want to say

1615
00:94:20.310 --> 00:94:25.819
2015, possibly 2016, there was an, an

1616
00:94:25.829 --> 00:94:30.529
art exposition in Germany or the Netherlands. I mean

1617
00:94:30.539 --> 00:94:32.390
, I, I might be getting the date and

1618
00:94:32.399 --> 00:94:34.838
the place wrong, but it was in definitely in

1619
00:94:34.850 --> 00:94:40.399
Europe and definitely in the mid 2010. So uh

1620
00:94:40.449 --> 00:94:45.588
uh someone uh put uh a dog in an art

1621
00:94:45.600 --> 00:94:51.168
exposition. He was, he was tied to the

1622
00:94:51.180 --> 00:94:55.890
by a rope, I think to, to the

1623
00:94:55.899 --> 00:95:00.418
wall and then uh uh in front of him.

1624
00:95:00.430 --> 00:95:03.640
But uh Alpa is rich. They put their uh

1625
00:95:03.649 --> 00:95:08.909
a plate with food and the dog couldn't reach the

1626
00:95:08.918 --> 00:95:11.220
food. And I would, that would, that

1627
00:95:11.229 --> 00:95:13.899
would infuriate me and the, and the, and

1628
00:95:13.909 --> 00:95:19.918
the dog dive of starvation in an art exposition.

1629
00:95:19.930 --> 00:95:23.878
And when, when I, and, and,

1630
00:95:23.890 --> 00:95:26.390
and, and I, I mean, I didn't

1631
00:95:26.399 --> 00:95:30.958
see that directly. Fortunately, but when I got

1632
00:95:30.970 --> 00:95:36.069
across that news, I was like, man,

1633
00:95:36.449 --> 00:95:42.208
whoever did this? I don't, I don't care

1634
00:95:42.220 --> 00:95:47.739
about abstract. I don't care about abstract well sounding

1635
00:95:47.750 --> 00:95:55.149
artistic liberty. That's just play cruelty, cruelty.

1636
00:95:56.869 --> 00:95:59.100
I mean, you don't do and I, I

1637
00:95:59.109 --> 00:96:00.628
, you're right. You don't do that to a

1638
00:96:00.640 --> 00:96:05.350
living being full stop it. I just stands there

1639
00:96:05.359 --> 00:96:10.399
. I don't care about artistic liberty and those well

1640
00:96:10.680 --> 00:96:13.649
sounding abstract words, I don't care about that.

1641
00:96:14.659 --> 00:96:16.279
I've never heard of that. And I'm, that's

1642
00:96:16.289 --> 00:96:18.838
disgusting. I just don't even, I don't even

1643
00:96:18.850 --> 00:96:21.390
understand. I don't think that's an artist. I

1644
00:96:21.399 --> 00:96:24.720
think that's a sadist who is pretending to be an

1645
00:96:24.729 --> 00:96:28.140
artist. I think that that's a very disturbed person

1646
00:96:28.918 --> 00:96:31.588
because artists, artists understand the difference between their work

1647
00:96:33.270 --> 00:96:36.548
and you know what I mean? They understand that

1648
00:96:36.560 --> 00:96:41.250
it's pretend and that they're, they're, they're reflecting

1649
00:96:42.250 --> 00:96:45.189
parts of the world around them and parts of their

1650
00:96:45.199 --> 00:96:54.770
imagination. Um, but that's, that doesn't make

1651
00:96:54.779 --> 00:96:56.548
any sense to me. I think that that artist

1652
00:96:56.560 --> 00:96:58.958
was a sadist who was masquerading as an artist.

1653
00:96:58.970 --> 00:97:01.270
I don't think that's, I don't, I,

1654
00:97:01.279 --> 00:97:03.289
I don't even, I, I can't even wrap

1655
00:97:03.298 --> 00:97:05.048
my head around. I know, look, there

1656
00:97:05.060 --> 00:97:10.930
, there are, there are troubling stuff in artistic

1657
00:97:10.939 --> 00:97:15.409
creation but that one II, I mean, that

1658
00:97:15.418 --> 00:97:18.958
, that, that, that went beyond all limits

1659
00:97:18.970 --> 00:97:21.289
for me. That, that was just probably the

1660
00:97:21.298 --> 00:97:28.220
worst thing I ever heard an artist doing. Uh

1661
00:97:28.869 --> 00:97:33.759
Yes, I agree. I think, um I

1662
00:97:33.770 --> 00:97:35.958
can't think of anything in specific but I think that

1663
00:97:35.970 --> 00:97:39.029
there, that there have been times when I've been

1664
00:97:39.039 --> 00:97:43.520
reading something and I have felt uncomfortable because I feel

1665
00:97:43.529 --> 00:97:49.878
like the artist is either describing something that they've done

1666
00:97:49.890 --> 00:97:56.199
or want to do that is abhorrent. And I

1667
00:97:56.208 --> 00:98:00.000
can't say what makes me think that they're not just

1668
00:98:00.369 --> 00:98:01.430
that it's not just in service of the story.

1669
00:98:01.520 --> 00:98:05.000
I, I'm not really sure what it is specifically

1670
00:98:05.009 --> 00:98:08.619
that made me feel that except that it's, it

1671
00:98:08.628 --> 00:98:10.390
, it's similar to when you just get a bad

1672
00:98:10.399 --> 00:98:12.430
feeling about a person that you meet and you just

1673
00:98:12.439 --> 00:98:14.409
think, I don't, I don't like that person

1674
00:98:14.418 --> 00:98:16.310
. There's something about them and, you know,

1675
00:98:16.319 --> 00:98:20.439
we just had a very, you know, perfunctory

1676
00:98:20.449 --> 00:98:24.890
conversation. It's, there's nothing that I can point

1677
00:98:24.899 --> 00:98:27.640
to specifically, but I don't have a uh I

1678
00:98:27.649 --> 00:98:30.470
don't have a positive feeling about this person. And

1679
00:98:30.479 --> 00:98:33.509
, you know, I, I mentioned that example

1680
00:98:33.520 --> 00:98:38.109
, that example specifically because in that example, there's

1681
00:98:38.119 --> 00:98:41.180
no doubt that the guy who did that is an

1682
00:98:41.189 --> 00:98:45.779
awful but, but, but I mentioned something,

1683
00:98:45.789 --> 00:98:50.560
there's something very sick. Yeah. But, but

1684
00:98:50.569 --> 00:98:57.039
that's the point I wanted to get at because sometimes

1685
00:98:57.470 --> 00:99:04.970
I find myself suspecting if there are particular kinds of

1686
00:99:04.979 --> 00:99:14.759
creators, artists that, uh, include certain things

1687
00:99:14.770 --> 00:99:18.439
in their stories because they, uh, uh,

1688
00:99:18.449 --> 00:99:25.239
not because they just want to artistically explore this or

1689
00:99:25.250 --> 00:99:29.439
that, or create some sort of emotional reaction but

1690
00:99:29.449 --> 00:99:33.079
because they are actually sick in their heads, I

1691
00:99:33.088 --> 00:99:36.989
think, yes, I think for sure in the

1692
00:99:38.000 --> 00:99:40.350
same way that I think that there are, you

1693
00:99:40.359 --> 00:99:44.270
know, people go into certain professions that are honorable

1694
00:99:44.279 --> 00:99:47.310
professions but they go into those professions because it allows

1695
00:99:47.319 --> 00:99:51.000
them under, you know, the guise of,

1696
00:99:51.009 --> 00:99:55.149
of either, um, you know, working with

1697
00:99:55.159 --> 00:99:58.350
Children or being in law enforcement to act out certain

1698
00:99:58.359 --> 00:100:00.569
fantasies of theirs that are not so healthy. You

1699
00:100:00.579 --> 00:100:02.430
know, I, I, that's something that we

1700
00:100:02.439 --> 00:100:06.270
always have to be careful of when, um,

1701
00:100:10.239 --> 00:100:15.128
you know, allowing people to be a, in

1702
00:100:15.140 --> 00:100:19.029
situations where others are vulnerable. Mhm. Yeah.

1703
00:100:19.039 --> 00:100:21.899
A and look, just to be clear, I'm

1704
00:100:21.909 --> 00:100:28.149
not saying at all at all that, all artists

1705
00:100:28.159 --> 00:100:30.128
are the mature, all artists are, are bad

1706
00:100:30.140 --> 00:100:33.699
people. I mean, one thing that at least

1707
00:100:33.708 --> 00:100:39.140
I learned in life and uh I haven't seen any

1708
00:100:39.149 --> 00:100:44.458
evidence that goes against it is that most people are

1709
00:100:44.470 --> 00:100:47.529
decent people. And that means that sometimes they make

1710
00:100:47.539 --> 00:100:50.810
mistakes, sometimes they do bad, bad things that

1711
00:100:50.819 --> 00:100:55.039
, but most of the time they're just going on

1712
00:100:55.048 --> 00:100:57.609
with their normal lives, they work, they have

1713
00:100:57.619 --> 00:101:00.810
their families, they do their things they try to

1714
00:101:00.819 --> 00:101:03.729
do as well as they can find. And then

1715
00:101:03.739 --> 00:101:09.789
there are a tiny minority of exceptionally good people and

1716
00:101:09.798 --> 00:101:11.759
then they are, there are also a t mi

1717
00:101:11.930 --> 00:101:16.060
uh, there's also a tiny minority of monsters and

1718
00:101:16.180 --> 00:101:18.298
, and, and, and, and, and

1719
00:101:18.310 --> 00:101:24.319
, and that's also the tiny minority of artists po

1720
00:101:24.329 --> 00:101:28.369
possibly that I am referring to here. So it's

1721
00:101:28.378 --> 00:101:30.479
just that, that I'm saying, I think you're

1722
00:101:30.489 --> 00:101:31.770
quite right and I, to me the evidence for

1723
00:101:31.779 --> 00:101:33.918
, for the fact that most people are, are

1724
00:101:33.930 --> 00:101:40.418
basically good under most circumstances, you know, particularly

1725
00:101:40.430 --> 00:101:43.979
if they're well socialized and if they're living within a

1726
00:101:43.989 --> 00:101:49.479
, a healthy enough society with uh, appropriate rules

1727
00:101:49.489 --> 00:101:53.939
and appropriate, um, punishments and, and,

1728
00:101:53.949 --> 00:101:57.859
and, um, incentives. But if, if

1729
00:101:57.869 --> 00:101:59.588
that weren't the case, we'd all be in pretty

1730
00:101:59.600 --> 00:102:00.708
big trouble, you know, every time we left

1731
00:102:00.720 --> 00:102:02.239
our house, you know, it would be like

1732
00:102:02.409 --> 00:102:04.829
, like the movie the purge, right that my

1733
00:102:04.838 --> 00:102:08.739
kids have seen. Um, so I, I

1734
00:102:08.750 --> 00:102:11.298
think you're absolutely right. I think though too,

1735
00:102:11.310 --> 00:102:13.600
that, that tiny minority can cause a lot of

1736
00:102:13.609 --> 00:102:15.869
trouble, the tiny minority of monsters. I mean

1737
00:102:15.878 --> 00:102:17.399
, we can see that on social media first.

1738
00:102:17.409 --> 00:102:18.520
I mean, I think that there are a lot

1739
00:102:18.529 --> 00:102:23.640
of bots on social media. Um, and,

1740
00:102:24.000 --> 00:102:25.600
well, that's, I guess an example of that

1741
00:102:25.609 --> 00:102:28.208
because here's somebody who's got a bot farm who has

1742
00:102:29.689 --> 00:102:33.500
, well, the worst intentions and are, you

1743
00:102:33.509 --> 00:102:41.399
know, dive bombing people's posts and saying absolutely horrible

1744
00:102:41.409 --> 00:102:43.819
things, anything from just, you know, things

1745
00:102:43.829 --> 00:102:47.000
that are uh abhorrent, just morally abhorrent to um

1746
00:102:48.189 --> 00:102:50.930
racist or, you know, whatever it is just

1747
00:102:50.939 --> 00:102:55.168
to, to kind of create the illusion that there

1748
00:102:55.180 --> 00:102:57.878
are more people who feel that way than, than

1749
00:102:57.890 --> 00:103:00.079
there really are. So that maybe they can feel

1750
00:103:00.088 --> 00:103:02.569
less alone in their depravity. I think that that

1751
00:103:02.579 --> 00:103:10.079
is, you know, part of the way that

1752
00:103:10.088 --> 00:103:12.958
, um you know, a, a platform like

1753
00:103:12.970 --> 00:103:16.720
, like Twitter. Um but it's not just Twitter

1754
00:103:16.729 --> 00:103:17.668
. I mean, I don't mean to pick on

1755
00:103:17.680 --> 00:103:19.500
Twitter because I actually, I like Twitter. I

1756
00:103:19.509 --> 00:103:21.899
use Twitter, I use a lot of social media

1757
00:103:21.909 --> 00:103:24.680
platforms and I think that they can be a force

1758
00:103:24.689 --> 00:103:26.229
for a lot of good, but they can also

1759
00:103:26.239 --> 00:103:28.878
be this weird sort of fun house mirror. It's

1760
00:103:28.890 --> 00:103:30.850
funny, I saw this interesting, I, I

1761
00:103:30.259 --> 00:103:33.869
passed this interesting post the other day and I wish

1762
00:103:33.878 --> 00:103:35.390
I had saved it, but I think I can

1763
00:103:35.399 --> 00:103:40.979
recall it but they uh the, the post basically

1764
00:103:40.989 --> 00:103:45.449
described how certain social media platforms, um kind of

1765
00:103:45.918 --> 00:103:50.220
cater to a certain one of the seven deadly sins

1766
00:103:50.229 --> 00:103:54.319
. You know, Instagram is vanity. Uh I

1767
00:103:54.329 --> 00:103:56.850
, I saw that Twitter is wrath, right?

1768
00:103:57.069 --> 00:104:00.220
Um, but I, I, you know,

1769
00:104:00.229 --> 00:104:03.798
Linkedin is Facebook is envy but I tt is L

1770
00:104:04.798 --> 00:104:08.619
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I, I thought

1771
00:104:08.628 --> 00:104:12.909
that was really smart because, um, you know

1772
00:104:12.918 --> 00:104:15.000
, at their, at their worst and this is

1773
00:104:15.009 --> 00:104:15.619
, this is what's so hard. I was talking

1774
00:104:15.628 --> 00:104:17.659
to another friend of mine. She had, you

1775
00:104:17.668 --> 00:104:20.750
know, been, she had built out a lot

1776
00:104:20.759 --> 00:104:26.640
of um the Amazon's advertising console, you know,

1777
00:104:26.649 --> 00:104:30.548
system. Um you know, she, she worked

1778
00:104:30.560 --> 00:104:33.409
in that and as a result she uh you know

1779
00:104:33.418 --> 00:104:35.810
, had, had been to conferences and such where

1780
00:104:35.819 --> 00:104:43.159
there were people who were dealing with um you know

1781
00:104:43.350 --> 00:104:45.739
, they were iii I wouldn't say they were content

1782
00:104:45.750 --> 00:104:48.529
moderators but they had some sort of function within these

1783
00:104:48.539 --> 00:104:51.399
uh social media companies that, that had to,

1784
00:104:51.529 --> 00:104:56.470
you know, monitor bots and all of this.

1785
00:104:56.479 --> 00:105:00.899
And she was saying how just like God, I

1786
00:105:00.909 --> 00:105:02.810
, I would not want that job for anything else

1787
00:105:02.819 --> 00:105:04.750
in the world because it's so hard and you can't

1788
00:105:04.759 --> 00:105:09.819
even imagine all the crazy stuff that is happening.

1789
00:105:10.128 --> 00:105:14.819
And um you know, the bot farms and the

1790
00:105:15.369 --> 00:105:15.739
, you know, people who are, who are

1791
00:105:15.750 --> 00:105:19.628
purposely, people and entities who are, you know

1792
00:105:19.640 --> 00:105:26.378
, purposely trying to um mhm you know, change

1793
00:105:26.390 --> 00:105:30.039
a narrative or, or make us see ourselves or

1794
00:105:30.048 --> 00:105:31.588
see the world in, in this sort of fun

1795
00:105:31.600 --> 00:105:35.548
house mirror way and, and how do you manage

1796
00:105:35.560 --> 00:105:39.909
that? How do you, um, how do

1797
00:105:39.918 --> 00:105:43.909
you get rid of the bots while still allowing people

1798
00:105:43.918 --> 00:105:48.458
to speak and allowing that free flow of ideas to

1799
00:105:48.470 --> 00:105:55.810
continue? It's very hard. Yep. Yeah.

1800
00:105:55.819 --> 00:105:58.338
But, but I mean, I just brought this

1801
00:105:58.350 --> 00:106:06.329
uh, discussion to the table about perhaps the morality

1802
00:106:06.338 --> 00:106:13.128
or immorality of certain, um, art pieces or

1803
00:106:13.140 --> 00:106:18.779
certain artists and, and perhaps uh possible the ontology

1804
00:106:18.789 --> 00:106:25.140
for artists or something like that because uh I mean

1805
00:106:25.149 --> 00:106:26.399
, I, I don't know, e even I

1806
00:106:26.409 --> 00:106:30.270
myself do not have any definitive answers to these questions

1807
00:106:30.279 --> 00:106:32.739
. And uh and I, and I myself am

1808
00:106:32.824 --> 00:106:35.975
not so sure even when it comes to that list

1809
00:106:35.984 --> 00:106:39.234
, I've mentioned of films, I don't recommend to

1810
00:106:39.244 --> 00:106:44.204
anyone if I should really not recommend them or I'm

1811
00:106:44.213 --> 00:106:47.003
still sort of thinking about it. And that's why

1812
00:106:47.015 --> 00:106:50.204
sometimes I bring that to the table when talking with

1813
00:106:50.213 --> 00:106:54.454
certain people to see if I can uh figure out

1814
00:106:54.463 --> 00:106:58.534
my own thought process. But uh I mean,

1815
00:106:58.543 --> 00:107:03.668
it's just questions that I think are worth uh exploring

1816
00:107:03.680 --> 00:107:11.220
because there are perhaps certain things that perhaps we give

1817
00:107:11.229 --> 00:107:16.458
artists too much leeway. Uh And, and because

1818
00:107:16.470 --> 00:107:21.520
they are artists, perhaps there are too many things

1819
00:107:21.529 --> 00:107:27.708
that we excuse and perhaps some of them we shouldn't

1820
00:107:28.029 --> 00:107:30.819
. I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure

1821
00:107:30.829 --> 00:107:35.220
. II I tend to think that when someone goes

1822
00:107:35.229 --> 00:107:40.529
too far as the artist with the dog did that

1823
00:107:41.628 --> 00:107:47.659
, the way that we tend to um counter that

1824
00:107:48.168 --> 00:107:53.850
is with a society healthy enough to condemn it and

1825
00:107:53.859 --> 00:108:00.509
not reward it. And that's, I think something

1826
00:108:00.520 --> 00:108:04.149
that we really need to be careful about in terms

1827
00:108:04.159 --> 00:108:11.909
of um you know, how, how we structure

1828
00:108:11.918 --> 00:108:14.298
our lives, how we structure our cultures and our

1829
00:108:14.310 --> 00:108:24.079
societies and understanding um when bad behaviors cannot be tolerated

1830
00:108:24.088 --> 00:108:30.430
and must be, um, must be not just

1831
00:108:30.439 --> 00:108:35.088
openly discouraged but really deterred in, in a way

1832
00:108:35.100 --> 00:108:40.259
that, that benefits the whole, right? But

1833
00:108:40.270 --> 00:108:53.168
not in a way that, um, iii,

1834
00:108:53.180 --> 00:108:58.439
I guess causes of, of this feels unfair and

1835
00:108:58.449 --> 00:109:00.250
causes a reaction, you know, a, a

1836
00:109:00.259 --> 00:109:02.588
counter reaction. But it's, it's, it's hard

1837
00:109:02.600 --> 00:109:05.140
. I mean, I, I am not a

1838
00:109:05.149 --> 00:109:08.770
moral relativist, you know, and I think that

1839
00:109:08.779 --> 00:109:13.539
the moral relativism that has kind of gripped, um

1840
00:109:15.390 --> 00:109:17.430
, that, that's, that we're in the grips

1841
00:109:17.439 --> 00:109:18.838
of, and that we have been in the grips

1842
00:109:18.850 --> 00:109:21.520
of for a few decades is not healthy. I

1843
00:109:21.529 --> 00:109:26.409
think that we have an obligation to ourselves and to

1844
00:109:26.418 --> 00:109:30.789
society at large and certainly to the most vulnerable to

1845
00:109:30.798 --> 00:109:33.029
make a decision as to what is morally acceptable behavior

1846
00:109:33.039 --> 00:109:36.539
and what isn't. Yeah. And, and you

1847
00:109:36.548 --> 00:109:38.838
know, and if we don't, we put,

1848
00:109:38.850 --> 00:109:41.859
we put people in danger, usually people who are

1849
00:109:41.869 --> 00:109:44.009
most vulnerable people who are poor people who are,

1850
00:109:44.020 --> 00:109:45.878
you know, Children who, you know, cannot

1851
00:109:46.520 --> 00:109:50.989
care for themselves and make decisions for themselves and that

1852
00:109:51.000 --> 00:109:54.838
, um, we have to have the strength to

1853
00:109:54.850 --> 00:109:58.668
stand up for, you know, what, what's

1854
00:109:59.020 --> 00:110:00.378
, what is the best thing to do even if

1855
00:110:00.390 --> 00:110:06.529
, uh, it can be harsh sometimes. Yeah

1856
00:110:06.649 --> 00:110:08.649
. No, I know. And, you know

1857
00:110:08.659 --> 00:110:11.439
, another thing that I find interesting here, at

1858
00:110:11.449 --> 00:110:14.609
least for me is that, um, I tend

1859
00:110:14.619 --> 00:110:17.359
to fall much more on the liberal side of the

1860
00:110:17.369 --> 00:110:20.470
aisle when it comes to politics, economics and all

1861
00:110:20.479 --> 00:110:25.079
of that. But when it comes to this particular

1862
00:110:25.289 --> 00:110:30.470
artistic, moral questions curiously enough, I, I

1863
00:110:30.479 --> 00:110:31.588
guess that all of the things I brought to the

1864
00:110:31.600 --> 00:110:36.668
table here would be the things that you usually associate

1865
00:110:36.680 --> 00:110:41.159
with conservatives as them, for example, saying that

1866
00:110:41.168 --> 00:110:43.600
, oh, you shouldn't pick that kind of thing

1867
00:110:43.609 --> 00:110:45.000
in art and where, uh, I mean,

1868
00:110:45.009 --> 00:110:47.378
that, that sort of thing. But yeah,

1869
00:110:47.439 --> 00:110:49.878
it, it is what it is so. Well

1870
00:110:49.890 --> 00:110:53.140
, we need both. I mean, really we

1871
00:110:53.149 --> 00:111:00.289
need, um, without conservatives, uh, people

1872
00:111:00.298 --> 00:111:01.548
who are more liberal and progressive would take us off

1873
00:111:01.560 --> 00:111:09.430
a cliff and without liberals and progressives, conservatives wouldn't

1874
00:111:09.439 --> 00:111:14.520
allow our society to grow because too cautious, we

1875
00:111:14.529 --> 00:111:15.279
need both to work together. And I, I

1876
00:111:15.289 --> 00:111:18.029
don't, I don't, I don't think it would

1877
00:111:18.039 --> 00:111:24.819
be healthy to be, um, someone who only

1878
00:111:24.829 --> 00:111:28.509
has a progressive mindset or only has a conservative mindset

1879
00:111:28.520 --> 00:111:30.520
. I think that, um, you know,

1880
00:111:30.529 --> 00:111:32.039
part of the culture war that we're having is the

1881
00:111:32.048 --> 00:111:35.539
result of these two extremes which often sound very similar

1882
00:111:35.548 --> 00:111:41.430
to one another. Um, having arguments over the

1883
00:111:41.439 --> 00:111:45.560
vast majority of people who tend to pick and choose

1884
00:111:45.810 --> 00:111:50.409
their, um, their, their, well,

1885
00:111:50.418 --> 00:111:53.208
their viewpoints, I guess a little, a little

1886
00:111:53.220 --> 00:111:55.939
more, um, bipartisanly, let's put it that

1887
00:111:55.949 --> 00:111:57.250
way. You know what I mean? And you

1888
00:111:57.259 --> 00:111:59.930
can be a very liberal person and yet think,

1889
00:112:00.699 --> 00:112:05.199
ok, I think that there are moral limits to

1890
00:112:05.208 --> 00:112:08.930
what, uh, say a performance artist like the

1891
00:112:08.939 --> 00:112:11.689
artist you mentioned should be able to do that.

1892
00:112:11.699 --> 00:112:13.878
No one should be able to come to harm or

1893
00:112:13.890 --> 00:112:16.418
no creature. Um No sentient creature like a dog

1894
00:112:16.430 --> 00:112:18.418
, you should be able to come to harm because

1895
00:112:18.430 --> 00:112:20.878
in the name of quote art, right? I

1896
00:112:20.890 --> 00:112:25.229
don't, I think that that is reasonable to have

1897
00:112:25.239 --> 00:112:28.930
that point of view and um just as it's reasonable

1898
00:112:28.939 --> 00:112:30.659
to be, you know, a conservative person and

1899
00:112:30.668 --> 00:112:33.048
, and say, I, I just, you

1900
00:112:33.060 --> 00:112:35.759
know, don't, don't have a problem with uh

1901
00:112:35.770 --> 00:112:43.128
finding a compromise on even an incredibly contentious uh societal

1902
00:112:43.640 --> 00:112:49.619
issue like, um like abortion or, or marriage

1903
00:112:49.628 --> 00:112:51.970
rights or what, whatever it is that that might

1904
00:112:51.979 --> 00:112:54.229
be there, you know, and I think most

1905
00:112:54.239 --> 00:112:56.979
people are willing to make compromises in between and most

1906
00:112:56.989 --> 00:113:00.529
people understand that there are pros and cons to,

1907
00:113:00.859 --> 00:113:03.270
to most issues and that we have to weigh those

1908
00:113:03.279 --> 00:113:06.298
as, as, as a society. And if

1909
00:113:06.310 --> 00:113:09.369
we're, if we're not weighing them and we're only

1910
00:113:09.378 --> 00:113:15.060
kind of marching lockstep with um whatever side we believe

1911
00:113:15.069 --> 00:113:17.149
ourselves to be on that, that doesn't really feel

1912
00:113:17.159 --> 00:113:19.899
like progress either. And that doesn't feel like,

1913
00:113:20.298 --> 00:113:25.069
um, like it will lead to a, a

1914
00:113:25.079 --> 00:113:29.949
graceful and functioning society. Well, actually, now

1915
00:113:29.958 --> 00:113:32.869
that I think about it and um referring to the

1916
00:113:32.878 --> 00:113:35.909
, that example with the dog, I think,

1917
00:113:35.918 --> 00:113:39.128
I, I don't know exactly when that started.

1918
00:113:39.140 --> 00:113:43.759
But uh uh uh uh don't you see now when

1919
00:113:43.770 --> 00:113:47.369
many times in movies before the movie starts, uh

1920
00:113:47.378 --> 00:113:50.939
, when they evolve animals a message there, something

1921
00:113:50.949 --> 00:113:58.199
like no animals were, were hurt in the filming

1922
00:113:58.208 --> 00:114:00.588
of this movie or something like that. So at

1923
00:114:00.600 --> 00:114:04.668
least that's something that, uh, people care more

1924
00:114:04.680 --> 00:114:10.680
about and think that it goes beyond, uh,

1925
00:114:10.689 --> 00:114:14.878
artistic expression, I guess. Yeah, I think

1926
00:114:14.890 --> 00:114:16.609
, I think most people are, are horrified by

1927
00:114:16.619 --> 00:114:18.319
that. I mean, really, I mean,

1928
00:114:18.329 --> 00:114:21.000
isn't that, that the, the one of the

1929
00:114:21.009 --> 00:114:25.378
signs of, of a future serial killer, someone

1930
00:114:25.390 --> 00:114:29.298
who tortures animals as a kid? You know,

1931
00:114:29.310 --> 00:114:31.539
I think that that is a pretty serious taboo.

1932
00:114:31.949 --> 00:114:36.109
Um, and rightly so, uh, of,

1933
00:114:36.119 --> 00:114:41.390
you know, for one's own gratification to be hurting

1934
00:114:41.399 --> 00:114:43.850
another being, you know, that's, that's something

1935
00:114:43.859 --> 00:114:45.529
that even, you know, even with like,

1936
00:114:45.539 --> 00:114:46.899
talking about 50 shades of gray that there's a reason

1937
00:114:46.909 --> 00:114:49.378
why in those, in, in those, um

1938
00:114:49.739 --> 00:114:54.270
, communities there are all sorts of strictures that are

1939
00:114:54.279 --> 00:114:58.890
put into place so that, um, you never

1940
00:114:58.899 --> 00:115:01.930
go too far because of how dangerous it is.

1941
00:115:03.310 --> 00:115:10.750
Um, when we do go too far. Yeah

1942
00:115:12.918 --> 00:115:16.140
, it is dangerous. You know, I think

1943
00:115:16.149 --> 00:115:19.838
that. Yeah, hi guys. Thank you for
