00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.160
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.698
Decent. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Loops

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.929
. And today I'm joined by Doctor Jean Manuel Rubin

4
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.579
. He is a professor of Ancient History at University

5
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.798
. He is a classic, a scholar who specializes

6
00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.539
in Greek antiquity, the historical anthropology of sport and

7
00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:25.750
the history of social inequalities. And today we're focusing

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.039
on his book, The Dangerous Life and Ideas Of

9
00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:32.750
Diogenes, The Cynic. So Jean Manuel, welcome

10
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.658
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.978
Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure to

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.590
be there. So, just before we get into

13
00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:45.668
diogenes self, just to get a little bit of

14
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.679
historical background, historical context to the period where he

15
00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.368
lived. So uh back then, uh te tell

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.950
us about this idea about how, how apparently back

17
00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:07.250
then uh many ancient Greek philosophers thought of philosophy as

18
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.948
a way of life. And why perhaps this is

19
00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:17.659
relevant for discussing uh diogenes philosophy. Yes. Uh

20
00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:21.088
You have different uh uh form of uh Greek and

21
00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:25.540
Roman philosophies who are conceived as a uh ethic philosophy

22
00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.198
, meaning philosophy of life, uh philosophy, which

23
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.760
is providing a kind of uh uh moral compass,

24
00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:37.010
moral scheme uh to uh organize your choices and to

25
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.150
decide what is wrong and what is right in life

26
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.129
. And the, the, the maybe the beginning

27
00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:45.459
of this movement is uh with Socrates. And the

28
00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.790
Diogenes is a pupil of Antisthenes, which is who

29
00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.528
is a pupil of Socrates. So you have this

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.260
kind of Greek tradition of uh um building um schools

31
00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:00.739
of thought uh which are a way of life,

32
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.569
ways of life at the same time. And cynicism

33
00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.278
is strongly based on these ideas, ideas that you

34
00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:14.389
cannot be only uh a philosopher producing ideas, but

35
00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.588
you have to uh leave them in your everyday life

36
00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.949
. So you cannot be only a scholar. You

37
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.909
have to be a kind of agent of your philosophy

38
00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.610
. And what was basically the context of the wider

39
00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:35.300
Mediterranean world back in the fourth century BC, which

40
00:02:35.308 --> 00:02:39.629
is apparently when Diogenes lived. Yeah, he's born

41
00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.899
at the end of the fifth century BC and he

42
00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.699
died during the 300 twenties uh around that. Um

43
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.360
So, yeah, he's a man of the fourth

44
00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:53.270
century BC. Uh It's a, it's an opening

45
00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:55.889
world, meaning that there is a kind of very

46
00:02:55.899 --> 00:03:00.199
dynamic international economy at the time and lots of conflicts

47
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.050
too around the Aegean Sea. And the thing is

48
00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:07.349
we have what is interesting is there are lots of

49
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.849
foreigners moving from one city to the other and diogenes

50
00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.550
was one of them because he suffered from an exile

51
00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.979
. He had to exile from his city, Sy

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.133
up on the Black Greek City and is one of

53
00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:27.955
these many thousands of foreigners going from one city to

54
00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:30.514
another. And the fourth century BC is really a

55
00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:36.335
moment when we see lots of foreigners in different cities

56
00:03:36.344 --> 00:03:38.645
, we cannot really observe that before. There were

57
00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:42.524
some foreigners at the fifth or the sixth century BC

58
00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:46.774
in the cities, cities were not closed communities but

59
00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:49.879
maybe not so many. Mhm So maybe that's,

60
00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.058
that's the first thing. The second thing is you

61
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.909
have at the same time in the fourth century,

62
00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.229
you have very little cities, meaning with 3000 inhabitants

63
00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.750
. And you have also very large ones like Syracuse

64
00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:10.429
like Alexandria at the end of the first century,

65
00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:14.719
like Rhodes, like Athens and Corinth and Athens and

66
00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.488
Corinth were two of the largest cities of the time

67
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:24.088
. And Diogenes choose to live alternately in each of

68
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.738
them. He was living during the, during the

69
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.329
the winter in Athens and during the summer in in

70
00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.040
, in Corinth. So he was living in very

71
00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:38.410
large city which are very specific kind of city,

72
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.769
city with a lot of different nationalities, people from

73
00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:46.048
all over the Mediterranean world. So tell us a

74
00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.730
little bit about perhaps what were some of the main

75
00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:54.519
events in the life of diogenes that you think really

76
00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:59.028
played the biggest role in shaping his philosophy? Because

77
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.028
I mean, I know that he was exiled at

78
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.488
a certain point and then he leave the situation there

79
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.290
in different cities. So tell us a little bit

80
00:05:08.298 --> 00:05:13.009
about why, why that happened and why he basically

81
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:15.428
had to be moving between different cities because I guess

82
00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.928
that then later on plays a role in aspects of

83
00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.869
his way of thinking and philosophy. Um yeah,

84
00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.709
he is, he is in exile. So he

85
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.629
, he has to flee from his city for a

86
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.819
very specific reason. He was involved with his father

87
00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:39.199
uh in a kind of uh money counterfeiting affair case

88
00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:42.358
. And uh he had to go away to avoid

89
00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:46.600
prison or even execution. So he left his city

90
00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:50.000
. We don't know exactly when, but it could

91
00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.488
be in the 300 sixties around that, that he

92
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.160
had to leave the city. And I think his

93
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.129
exile in the fourth century BC doesn't mean the same

94
00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.250
maybe or maybe it means the same as today.

95
00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.850
It's a very hard uh experiment of life. It's

96
00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:14.639
considered by ancient people as the kind of ultimate uh

97
00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.509
detachment, uh ultimate loss. Uh Because when I

98
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.399
was talking about lots of foreigners in the 400 century

99
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.670
world, most of them were coming back on a

100
00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:27.559
regular basis to their city, their original cities,

101
00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.778
they were just moving from one to the other doing

102
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.295
some uh trade, but they were back to the

103
00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:35.764
city. And then you have exiles and exile is

104
00:06:35.774 --> 00:06:42.173
a very complicated thing because then it means you lose

105
00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:46.944
your complete social environment, you lose the ability to

106
00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:49.733
get buried when you die in your, the earth

107
00:06:49.744 --> 00:06:53.634
, the ground of your motherland, which means a

108
00:06:53.644 --> 00:06:56.213
lot to an ancient Greek of the, of the

109
00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.444
time. So this, this is the first really

110
00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.509
traumatic experience of diogenes uh life. And um this

111
00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:09.970
is the beginning, in fact of his philosophical career

112
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.108
, we don't know if uh two months, six

113
00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:15.923
months, two years, five years uh happened before

114
00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:19.764
or between the exile and the beginning of the philosophical

115
00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.944
life. But we know that there is a kind

116
00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:27.524
of very strong link between the two episodes. Uh

117
00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:30.095
The thing is when you lose attached to your,

118
00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:32.884
to your city, uh you lose your, your

119
00:07:32.894 --> 00:07:36.254
main belonging, you were suppose in a Greek world

120
00:07:36.264 --> 00:07:38.944
, you are supposed to belong to your family,

121
00:07:39.264 --> 00:07:42.045
to your neighborhood, to your village, to your

122
00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:45.000
city mainly. And then you, you are apart

123
00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.559
from this uh belonging and this kind of experience of

124
00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:54.608
detachment uh had a strong effect on uh um the

125
00:07:54.619 --> 00:08:00.129
way uh diogenes conceived his philosophy because cynicism is a

126
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.069
philosophy of detachment. You are, you are supposed

127
00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:05.379
to refuse uh every kind of belonging. You're not

128
00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:07.928
supposed to get married, you're not supposed to build

129
00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:11.548
a family. Uh Family is a cultural construct.

130
00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:15.949
City is a cultural construct. So uh there is

131
00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:18.889
a, there is a clear link between the experience

132
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:24.160
of exile and the, the way diogenes shaped uh

133
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.259
cynicism philosophy, cynic philosophy. So this is one

134
00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.528
of the main ways we got into the idea of

135
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.500
cosmopolitan, cosmopolitanism, right. Yeah, this is

136
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:37.558
one of the routes. Uh There is maybe a

137
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.279
second uh context uh element which is Sinop is the

138
00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:46.219
original city. Is a native uh city, is

139
00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:50.250
a city on the south shore of the Black Sea

140
00:08:50.558 --> 00:08:52.359
, uh meaning uh north of Asia Minor. Uh

141
00:08:52.369 --> 00:08:56.190
And here at the time, there are lots of

142
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.239
um barbarian uh ethnic. Many of them were in

143
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.509
the Persian Empire and were, which are in contact

144
00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:07.879
with uh Syn O or threatening Syn up on the

145
00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.678
other Greek cities of the Black Sea, meaning that

146
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:16.599
very early diogenes had a personal experience of the relationship

147
00:09:16.609 --> 00:09:22.798
with other culture, other ethnic non-greek uh people.

148
00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.779
Uh So, so the, the cosmopolitanism, which

149
00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:30.219
is uh which is credited of the invention um the

150
00:09:30.229 --> 00:09:33.288
cosmopolitanism uh is at the same time, can be

151
00:09:33.298 --> 00:09:37.590
understood as a, as a consequence of his exile

152
00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:39.369
. And at the same time, uh of his

153
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:43.450
experience of uh barbarian uh ethnic and conflicts in Asia

154
00:09:43.538 --> 00:09:46.558
Minor. Yes. And by the way back then

155
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.690
, because uh in the kind of world we live

156
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.514
in nowadays, things work, I guess very differently

157
00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:56.934
. But back then moving, for example, between

158
00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:01.735
cities and between states, I mean, how hard

159
00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:05.065
or easy was it? Because I mean, I

160
00:10:05.075 --> 00:10:09.335
imagine that back then people didn't have really documentation and

161
00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:13.014
but then when it came to, for example,

162
00:10:13.025 --> 00:10:16.182
the social and political status of an exile or someone

163
00:10:16.192 --> 00:10:20.980
was not considered a citizen. I mean, how

164
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:22.381
did it work back then? I would imagine it

165
00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:26.121
would vary between, for example, city states in

166
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:30.341
Greece, how would they deal with those kinds of

167
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.910
people? But how was it back then? A

168
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:37.090
living that way? Yes. Yes, there are

169
00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.590
different situations. Every city is a kind of,

170
00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:41.149
is a city state. So it's a kind of

171
00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:43.349
very little nation if you want. So, so

172
00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:46.548
, so you have a body of citizens. They

173
00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:50.019
are the one with the power, the political power

174
00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:54.808
, uh and the the uh judiciary power. So

175
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.259
they, they go, they, they are working

176
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:58.099
in courts, they are working in the assembly,

177
00:10:58.109 --> 00:11:01.070
in the councils, et cetera, then you are

178
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.750
foreigners. So if you are in exile, uh

179
00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:05.229
the normal situation, if you are free, if

180
00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:07.629
you're not a slave, the normal situation is,

181
00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:11.099
is is that you will be a resident for now

182
00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:15.109
. Uh then in some very specific situations, some

183
00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:20.788
cities including Athens um build some uh like exclusive personal

184
00:11:20.798 --> 00:11:24.239
status from uh for exiles coming from a city that

185
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.889
is a kind of ally city. So when you

186
00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:30.269
have a civil war in an allied city and when

187
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.349
the democratic people are exiled from their city, it

188
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.349
has happened in the fifth and the fourth century,

189
00:11:35.359 --> 00:11:41.090
we see that Athens built some very um um exclusive

190
00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:43.798
with some privileged uh personal status for this group of

191
00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:46.668
exiles. But this didn't happen to diogenes when he

192
00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:50.408
arrived in Athens or in Corinth, he was only

193
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.538
just a kind of resident foreigner. So you have

194
00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:56.940
to register, uh and you have to pay taxes

195
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.219
as a resident foreigner, which is very important.

196
00:12:00.229 --> 00:12:03.000
It's not very expensive, but it's very important because

197
00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:05.019
if you don't, you are suspected to try to

198
00:12:05.029 --> 00:12:07.960
pretend you're a citizen. If you don't pay the

199
00:12:07.969 --> 00:12:11.330
foreigner tax, then you are, you can suffer

200
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.489
a trial and there are some heavy risk uh with

201
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.840
that coming. So uh the the situation where you

202
00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:20.899
are moving from one city to the other is is

203
00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:22.288
that you will be uh if you are there for

204
00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:26.479
some days or some weeks, you will be like

205
00:12:26.489 --> 00:12:28.450
a provisory foreigner and then there is no administration,

206
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.529
but you have no rights either. Meaning that if

207
00:12:31.538 --> 00:12:35.558
you are threatened, beaten, stolen, you have

208
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.399
no way to defend yourself in court. Uh But

209
00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:39.408
then when you are a resident for Rena, then

210
00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:43.649
you have a kind of protection from the city,

211
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.558
but you have no political right, no judiciary,

212
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.219
right? Meaning you, you cannot, uh you

213
00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:50.750
cannot vote in a court, you cannot vote in

214
00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:54.379
an assembly, you cannot be a magistrate. So

215
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:58.979
that's the situation for free people. Of course,

216
00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:01.058
for, if you are suspected to be a slave

217
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.769
, then the situation is even different. And by

218
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:07.308
the way, diogenes himself was a slave for a

219
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.359
little while. Yes. Uh during the 300 forties

220
00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:13.279
, it's been abducted by pirates, which was a

221
00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:18.048
very not, not common that uh not unusual event

222
00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:22.019
. There are lots of pirates in the Aegean and

223
00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:24.200
Mediterranean Sea at the time. And even Alexander,

224
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.769
the Great had to uh to fight against pirates around

225
00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:33.190
crete for some time. Uh And uh yes,

226
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.428
so the pirates were attacking villages, they were abducting

227
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.330
people and then uh two ways. The first way

228
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.479
is they were asking for a ransom and they were

229
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.080
giving back the people they had abducted if they got

230
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.580
the ransom. First situation, second situation, they

231
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.298
were um going away from the place where they did

232
00:13:54.308 --> 00:13:56.460
the abduction and selling everyone on a market slave.

233
00:13:56.599 --> 00:14:00.058
That's what happened to diogenes. It's been uh it's

234
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.029
been sold to a Corinthian uh Man Xenia. And

235
00:14:05.038 --> 00:14:09.210
after some years he's been released, freed and franchised

236
00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:11.479
. So, yes, he, he had an

237
00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:15.918
exper a personal experience of uh uh slavery. He's

238
00:14:15.928 --> 00:14:18.538
not the only philosopher who had that experience, but

239
00:14:18.548 --> 00:14:20.259
he's one, he's one of them and lots of

240
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:24.979
people had this experience and this fear to be abducted

241
00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.298
by pirates. Yes. Mhm And I mean,

242
00:14:28.308 --> 00:14:31.500
of course, I imagine that he was exposed to

243
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:37.830
different cultures. So was the uh cultural relativist in

244
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.349
any way. Yes. Uh Yeah, in a

245
00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.889
way you could, you could say that he,

246
00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.969
he, he, he had the idea that lots

247
00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:50.759
of uh things in everyday social life were culturally,

248
00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:56.200
culturally built. So uh he was uh looking as

249
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.320
most of social conventions as convention on social customs as

250
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.479
customs, meaning for diogenes, marriage was a cultural

251
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:11.700
uh custom, family was a cultural uh custom wealth

252
00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:13.889
as a cultural custom. So in a way,

253
00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:18.609
uh when you develop this kind of uh um philosophy

254
00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.879
, you could, you could say you are a

255
00:15:20.889 --> 00:15:22.678
cultural relativist meaning that you are. But the thing

256
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.219
is he was, he was not interested in comparing

257
00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:31.729
culture was interesting and uh in opposing culture and nature

258
00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:35.129
. Yeah. And basically, I guess that through

259
00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:39.469
his life experiences, it became easier for him to

260
00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:45.109
basically question norms. He spent most of his life

261
00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:48.219
doing that. Absolutely. Doing, trying to uh

262
00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:52.308
to unbuilt uh uh norms and to, to not

263
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.750
, not always to contest them but to question them

264
00:15:56.859 --> 00:16:00.085
to, to make people understand that they were only

265
00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:03.894
customs norms and they were not facts uh by nature

266
00:16:03.913 --> 00:16:07.734
. So it was a, it is a big

267
00:16:07.744 --> 00:16:11.344
part of uh uh cynicism uh that the to,

268
00:16:11.354 --> 00:16:17.053
to, to point at uh culturally built uh ways

269
00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:18.960
of life. Yes. Mhm A and the uh

270
00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:22.570
in the book, you also talk about how one

271
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.808
of his ideas was about attacking uh power, glory

272
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.038
and the obs the obsession some people have with social

273
00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:36.739
status. Could you tell us about that uh attack

274
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.359
, you said glory and of social status and obsession

275
00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:45.019
with social status. In fact, for diogenes,

276
00:16:45.418 --> 00:16:48.690
there are important matters, philosophical ones and they are

277
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:56.288
superficial matters and to Search for power is a kind

278
00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:59.200
of super, super act to search for glory.

279
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.940
If you are an athlete or political um um leader

280
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.049
or a military leader is a, is a superficial

281
00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.400
one. And to search for better status too,

282
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.539
meaning that uh for dere, if you are a

283
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:15.739
slave, you don't need to search for freedom.

284
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.338
If you are a foreigner, you don't need to

285
00:17:18.348 --> 00:17:19.939
search for citizenship. If you are a citizen,

286
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.239
you don't need to search for uh kind of better

287
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.150
political position in your city. All of these are

288
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.068
superficial goals. They are not helping you uh in

289
00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:37.838
a philosophical way to behave uh better uh without um

290
00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:41.828
pursuing uh artificial goals. So uh one of the

291
00:17:41.838 --> 00:17:47.368
parts of cynicism was to point at those um artificial

292
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.789
uh artificial goals and intentions. You are supposed to

293
00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:55.789
go back to what is essential, what is necessary

294
00:17:55.799 --> 00:18:00.140
needs uh not nothing uh extravagant and the power is

295
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.630
considered as a kind of uh useless uh goal and

296
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.699
glory to a athletes are attacked on a regular basis

297
00:18:08.709 --> 00:18:12.539
because they are uh two diogenes, eyes focused uh

298
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:17.098
on uh the search of glory instead of being focused

299
00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:19.930
on the search of philosophy. And of course,

300
00:18:19.939 --> 00:18:25.529
he ended up living in poverty most of his life

301
00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:26.640
. And in the book, he talked about how

302
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:33.209
he distinguished between the fact of poverty and the feeling

303
00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:36.608
of poverty. So, what's the distinction there?

304
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.799
Yes. So it's uh the distinction is very popular

305
00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:45.180
in the philosophical field of the end of the fifth

306
00:18:45.189 --> 00:18:47.969
century and the beginning of the fourth century. So

307
00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:52.150
, eogene is like uh uh um appropriating an idea

308
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.039
that has always been uh that, that has been

309
00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:57.660
, I'm sorry, that has been formulated before him

310
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.259
, by Socrates, by uh antisthenes, by Xenophobe

311
00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:03.868
. So it's a very popular idea uh which is

312
00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.890
the distinction between the fact of poverty and the feeling

313
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.170
of poverty, meaning uh indigenous point of view,

314
00:19:14.078 --> 00:19:18.078
you have to make a distinction between people who are

315
00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:22.549
uh like uh really poor because they have absolutely nothing

316
00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:26.880
to live and survive and people uh who feel poor

317
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:30.348
because there are more needs that they have means,

318
00:19:30.358 --> 00:19:33.630
meaning that you can uh extremely wealthy, you can

319
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.789
be one of the wealthiest men of your city.

320
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.029
But if you have uh piled uh lots of obligations

321
00:19:41.209 --> 00:19:45.108
, uh financial ones, personal ones, maybe you

322
00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:49.939
are in difficulty to face all these obligations. So

323
00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:52.848
, uh the, the idea is that you have

324
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:55.759
to, to see if someone is rich or poor

325
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.848
, you have to look at what he needs on

326
00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:00.068
a regular basis. So he does he have a

327
00:20:00.078 --> 00:20:03.279
frugal life or not? And what are his means

328
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.529
? And even if you have big means, if

329
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.430
you have bigger needs because you are organizing banquets for

330
00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:14.068
your friends all the time because you are financing very

331
00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:18.229
expensive um programs in the city, et cetera.

332
00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:22.189
Maybe you will suffer from a feeling of poverty,

333
00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:23.858
even if not, if on the paper, you're

334
00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:26.209
not poor at all. So that's a kind of

335
00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:30.019
very interesting distinction because it's, it's been um uh

336
00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:33.500
it's still in use in uh contemporary sociology, the

337
00:20:33.509 --> 00:20:37.400
distinction between fact and feeling of poverty. And it

338
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.588
came from uh those from the Socratic school. In

339
00:20:40.598 --> 00:20:41.588
fact, Socrates, Antisthenes xenophobia, genist. So

340
00:20:41.598 --> 00:20:49.130
yes, and this is linked with um this question

341
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.680
, in fact, is linked with the um a

342
00:20:52.689 --> 00:20:55.828
kind of revolution in the intellectual world of the 4th

343
00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.328
, 5th, 4th century BC, which is the

344
00:20:57.338 --> 00:21:00.449
part of the idea of economy. Um at the

345
00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:03.750
end of the fifth century and the beginning of the

346
00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:07.838
fourth. So around 400 BC, we have a

347
00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:11.729
series of new words, words uh in the Greek

348
00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:17.309
lexicon were appearing in the language uh meaning uh econom

349
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.939
, uh economical, economical, economia, economia,

350
00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:25.549
we gave that gave birth to our economy, uh

351
00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:29.390
econom uh which mean someone which mean a manager of

352
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.338
his household, uh econo, which means uh someone

353
00:21:33.348 --> 00:21:40.019
uh who has some qualities in management in his private

354
00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:44.309
household. Uh What I'm trying to tell is at

355
00:21:44.318 --> 00:21:45.358
the end of the fifth and beginning of the first

356
00:21:45.368 --> 00:21:48.848
century, there are some new words to describe a

357
00:21:48.858 --> 00:21:52.848
reality which is new to Greek Ice at the time

358
00:21:52.858 --> 00:21:56.670
, which is the uh economic management. Before that

359
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.289
nobody has ever developed a kind of uh thought about

360
00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:06.640
this economic world. And suddenly uh it appears to

361
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:07.789
Greeks that it is, it is something you have

362
00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:11.449
to understand. And uh of course, as it's

363
00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:14.608
the same time when you have a new discipline appearing

364
00:22:14.618 --> 00:22:15.559
, there is no economist at the time. So

365
00:22:15.568 --> 00:22:19.019
all um the people who are thinking about this new

366
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:22.890
economy are philos of philosophers. So every uh uh

367
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.709
philosophical school of the time uh has produced some economic

368
00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:33.049
treaties about this question of management. What it is

369
00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:33.689
to uh to be rich, to be poor,

370
00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:37.318
what it, how do you organize your household or

371
00:22:37.328 --> 00:22:41.049
how do you manage your slave? How do you

372
00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.848
choose your wife, et cetera, which are considered

373
00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:48.729
as economic questions a and related to his uh to

374
00:22:48.739 --> 00:22:53.150
diogenes econom, economic ideas. There's also this idea

375
00:22:53.160 --> 00:23:00.660
of his criticizing a system governing the accumulation and distribution

376
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.390
of wealth. Right? Yes, absolutely. In

377
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.108
different ways uh In diogenes, ice money, coins

378
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:12.449
are a cultural construct. They are useless. So

379
00:23:12.459 --> 00:23:15.930
we shouldn't need coins to, to trade, for

380
00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:19.449
example. So that's maybe the first level. But

381
00:23:19.459 --> 00:23:23.000
the second level is that wealth is not a goal

382
00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:26.729
. You, you, you shouldn't try to get

383
00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:29.890
richer because it's useless. You should do the opposite

384
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.539
. You should try to feel rich by um decreasing

385
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:37.868
your, your needs. So, in the relationship

386
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.890
between means and needs, uh it says, OK

387
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.469
, people are focused on increasing their means. They

388
00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:45.979
shouldn't, they should be focused on decreasing their needs

389
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:48.578
. And this is cynic uh way of life.

390
00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:52.618
You are supposed to live a very simple, very

391
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:57.400
frugal, very aic oric uh life. So yes

392
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.979
, that's, that's the idea that's uh wealth on

393
00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:04.989
the field of wealth and patrimony and owning uh is

394
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.160
uh something you have to fight against. This is

395
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.088
useless and this is even more useless in diogenes eyes

396
00:24:12.209 --> 00:24:15.680
because you're not supposed to build a family on the

397
00:24:15.689 --> 00:24:18.719
dynasty. So in Greeks eyes, you are supposed

398
00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:22.118
to build wealth patrimony household because you want to give

399
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:26.049
it to your heirs. So this is a family

400
00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:27.578
matter, you are supposed to, to transfer to

401
00:24:27.588 --> 00:24:32.199
provide, to increase the family wealth and to give

402
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:34.559
it to the next generation. And diogenes says we

403
00:24:34.568 --> 00:24:38.009
don't need to make kids and and we don't need

404
00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:41.650
to uh transfer any kind of wealth. So everything

405
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.160
is linked in a way, the the the need

406
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.118
for our family and the need for the source of

407
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.709
wealth are both uh contested in scenic point of view

408
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:56.368
and related to the distribution of wealth. Did we

409
00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:03.410
care about economic inequality? For example? No.

410
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.799
Uh you couldn't say that really. Uh there is

411
00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:10.969
no uh um social conscience in a cynicism in a

412
00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:11.838
way we could say that in a, in a

413
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.809
, in a modern world. Uh for, for

414
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:18.739
diogenes, this is an individual question that is not

415
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.348
really like a social categories uh that we have to

416
00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:26.390
improve the situation as the way to improve your situation

417
00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:29.299
is to live a philosophical life. So it's not

418
00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:33.108
uh um social aid won't help you. Uh Anyway

419
00:25:33.118 --> 00:25:36.299
, social aid in the Greek City is a very

420
00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:40.588
, very tiny uh uh matter for everyone. But

421
00:25:40.598 --> 00:25:42.769
apart from that endogenous uh point of view, like

422
00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:45.979
you said, with the fact of poverty and the

423
00:25:45.989 --> 00:25:48.500
feeling of poverty, that's what you have to deal

424
00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:52.309
with is this uh ability to feel rich and this

425
00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:56.059
is a very individual matter, you have to face

426
00:25:56.068 --> 00:25:59.439
it by yourself. So as long as you don't

427
00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:00.890
, again, for, for cynics, you,

428
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.059
you are not supposed to belong to any kind of

429
00:26:03.068 --> 00:26:07.930
category, including social category. And of course,

430
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:14.920
he was also a mendicant philosopher, he practiced mendicancy

431
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.670
. And back then, how did uh Greeks look

432
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.868
at that way of living? I mean, was

433
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.858
that also a sort of violation of some norms in

434
00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:30.618
Greek society? Yeah, you could say that.

435
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.500
Yes. Uh It's uh um for Greek of the

436
00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:38.199
first century, a beggar is a parasite basically.

437
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.269
Uh It is considered as a parasite because the main

438
00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:47.059
um uh the main social value in the relationship is

439
00:26:47.068 --> 00:26:48.939
, is what they call Philia, which is a

440
00:26:48.949 --> 00:26:52.140
known philosophical concept. We uh we often uh translate

441
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.259
it by friendship, but the the closest translation would

442
00:26:56.269 --> 00:27:00.368
be will be reciprocity. Uh So uh what does

443
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:00.818
it mean? It means that you are in a

444
00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:04.539
world where there is no social security, there is

445
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:08.890
no insurance, meaning that the level of protection on

446
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.598
, on security and safe social safety you can get

447
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:18.009
is heavily linked with the number of um reciprocal relationship

448
00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:21.150
. You build with people, with your friends,

449
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:23.420
with your family, with your neighbors, with uh

450
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:27.059
the citizens of your city. So uh you build

451
00:27:27.068 --> 00:27:30.328
relationship. What does it mean in everyday life?

452
00:27:30.338 --> 00:27:32.568
It means that if you have a sacrifice, you

453
00:27:32.578 --> 00:27:34.328
sacrifice an animal because you have, you are uh

454
00:27:34.338 --> 00:27:40.009
organizing the wedding of your daughter, for example.

455
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:41.709
Uh then if you don't invite your neighbor, you

456
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:45.199
will come to your neighbor and you will give your

457
00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:48.858
neighbor a piece of the sacrifice because maybe in two

458
00:27:48.868 --> 00:27:51.959
months, in three months, you will have a

459
00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:52.949
problem. You will be on your field and you

460
00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:56.410
will break a tool and you will need your neighbor

461
00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.880
to, to borrow uh a tool. So uh

462
00:28:00.009 --> 00:28:03.838
um that's, that's the way Greeks understand social life

463
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:07.140
. You are, you are giving to people and

464
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.449
they are giving to you when you need something.

465
00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:11.219
So it works in the family. It works with

466
00:28:11.229 --> 00:28:14.299
one. It, it works with neighbors. The

467
00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:15.949
thing is uh um beggars, they don't, they

468
00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:19.250
are not part of that uh like virtual circle.

469
00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:22.269
They are away from that because they never give anything

470
00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:26.130
. Basically, they only ask for arms. So

471
00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.209
uh they are considered as a um lost causes if

472
00:28:30.219 --> 00:28:33.439
you want. There is a uh a Greek proverb

473
00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:37.180
saying something like uh uh not even uh um not

474
00:28:37.189 --> 00:28:40.430
even a beggar's parents or his friends. Uh So

475
00:28:40.439 --> 00:28:41.279
So, meaning that you, if you are a

476
00:28:41.289 --> 00:28:44.989
beggar, you are alone, you are by yourself

477
00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:47.469
. Uh So they are the, the, the

478
00:28:47.479 --> 00:28:52.939
basic conception of a man decency is that uh beggars

479
00:28:52.949 --> 00:28:56.939
are parasites. And then cynics come and they change

480
00:28:56.949 --> 00:29:00.650
the, the, the pattern. They say uh

481
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.259
that of course, they ask for something, they

482
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:07.759
ask for arms, but in exchange, they provide

483
00:29:07.769 --> 00:29:11.578
philosophy, they provide advice, they provide wisdom,

484
00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:15.459
they provide clarity of thinking, et cetera. So

485
00:29:15.469 --> 00:29:18.509
they are giving something in return. And that is

486
00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:22.098
a Greek word to say, to ask for S

487
00:29:22.348 --> 00:29:25.410
uh E and there is a Greek word to say

488
00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:27.118
to give something in return at it. Meaning that

489
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.250
in the, in the Greek conception, in the

490
00:29:30.259 --> 00:29:33.670
cynic conception, I mean, uh the fact of

491
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.309
begging is not a parasite attitude. It's a kind

492
00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:41.949
of give and take attitude. So that is what

493
00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:47.250
is really new with uh um uh cynic uh philosophy

494
00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:51.009
. It is um giving birth to the, the

495
00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:55.449
idea that a beggar uh the life of begging can

496
00:29:55.459 --> 00:29:59.618
be a life of philosophy. And by the way

497
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.868
, of course, we tend to associate diogenes very

498
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.259
much with the with these jar. I mean,

499
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:08.900
many times people talk about it as being a barrel

500
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.838
and not a jar, we can get into that

501
00:30:11.848 --> 00:30:18.130
. But why is the jar so important as a

502
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.219
sort of symbol of his life? Why do people

503
00:30:22.229 --> 00:30:26.949
associate him so much with the jar? Um be

504
00:30:26.108 --> 00:30:30.539
first, it's a symbol first. It's a symbol

505
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:37.578
uh of uh um of frugality of uh life of

506
00:30:37.588 --> 00:30:41.039
uh uh economy. Uh a very uh uh OIC

507
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:44.104
life, very simple life. So that's first,

508
00:30:44.114 --> 00:30:45.924
that's a symbol. But the thing is in real

509
00:30:45.934 --> 00:30:48.505
life, that's the way it could be for some

510
00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:52.275
people. Some people were living in empty graves,

511
00:30:52.443 --> 00:30:55.775
in cabins, in huts, in tents and in

512
00:30:55.785 --> 00:30:57.894
jars. And we know that from the fifth century

513
00:30:57.904 --> 00:31:00.404
during the Peronne Asian War, we have some uh

514
00:31:00.414 --> 00:31:03.733
text mainly a text from toy leaders, the historian

515
00:31:03.743 --> 00:31:06.953
, the main historian of the Peronne Asian War.

516
00:31:07.084 --> 00:31:11.074
Uh and he's explaining and he's giving details about the

517
00:31:11.084 --> 00:31:15.709
way um Athenian people had to leave when they took

518
00:31:15.719 --> 00:31:19.750
refuge inside the walls of the city in 431.

519
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.759
And we have information about these temporary shelters, temporary

520
00:31:26.769 --> 00:31:30.289
accommodations and it is empty graves. It is tents

521
00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:33.289
and it is jars. They use jars because those

522
00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:37.660
jars are what Greek call pit oil are very large

523
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.059
, very high ceramic jars. They can be more

524
00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:42.130
than 2 m high. We still have some,

525
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.130
some of them thanks to the archaeology of it.

526
00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.500
And uh uh they can be very high. They

527
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:51.229
were used to store food, to store uh uh

528
00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:56.150
grain cereals and different kind of uh different kind of

529
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.250
uh of food. And most of the time they

530
00:31:57.259 --> 00:32:04.634
were put inside the ground like uh uh you have

531
00:32:04.644 --> 00:32:07.344
to dig to put them half of them in the

532
00:32:07.354 --> 00:32:09.574
ground to, to make them stable and then you

533
00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:15.055
could use them in a crisis situation to live in

534
00:32:15.064 --> 00:32:17.055
it. So, and that's what diogenes did in

535
00:32:17.064 --> 00:32:21.368
Athens in the, in the edges of the Ara

536
00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:23.219
, uh, in the metro sanctuary. He had

537
00:32:23.229 --> 00:32:27.108
a jar and he decided to leave to live there

538
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.098
. No, we have no idea how the jar

539
00:32:29.108 --> 00:32:30.939
arrived there, but it must have been a jar

540
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.969
from the sanctuary and then it was empty and uh

541
00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:37.509
someone maybe cleaned it, maybe not. Uh anyway

542
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.559
, he, he used it uh to, to

543
00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:40.529
live there for, for some time. So it's

544
00:32:40.539 --> 00:32:44.449
not a tale or legend. It's a uh it's

545
00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:51.059
a normal um uh crisis uh housing in certain,

546
00:32:51.068 --> 00:32:53.539
in certain context. So when uh when Diogenes in

547
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:59.259
the 300 sixties, 300 fifties did that in Athens

548
00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:04.170
, lots of Athenians had already seen some people living

549
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.949
in this kind of drought. So this is no

550
00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:07.400
surprise. Uh for them, this is not a

551
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:13.410
kind of abnormal way of living. It's not usual

552
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.358
on the Agora, but it's not totally uh unique

553
00:33:16.368 --> 00:33:20.809
or crazy. And then uh the story has uh

554
00:33:20.818 --> 00:33:24.489
changed in Roman times when uh Latin philosophers and Latin

555
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:30.670
writers began to tell Diogenes story in Latin. And

556
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.400
they had to translate from Phos the Greek work to

557
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.900
the draw to a kind of uh Latin equivalent.

558
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.880
And they used uh do mainly uh which is a

559
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:45.019
way to say barrel, uh a cask, wooden

560
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:46.809
cask. And uh but when they did that translation

561
00:33:46.818 --> 00:33:52.039
, they knew they were uh um they knew that

562
00:33:52.049 --> 00:33:54.199
the original word was meaning ceramic jar. They were

563
00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:59.759
just adjusting to their uh l uh But then after

564
00:33:59.769 --> 00:34:02.009
that, the memory of that got lost in the

565
00:34:02.019 --> 00:34:06.259
way. And after, during some centuries, we've

566
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:09.878
been uh describing painting, showing, telling that diogenes

567
00:34:10.039 --> 00:34:13.820
lived in a barrel. So we have lots of

568
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.349
uh modern paintings, for example, with uh Diogenes

569
00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:21.644
in um in a barrel and lots of books talking

570
00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:24.543
about Diogenes barrel, which is a pure le for

571
00:34:24.554 --> 00:34:28.554
, this is a pure legend because when Diogenes was

572
00:34:28.563 --> 00:34:30.465
alive in the first century BC, there was no

573
00:34:30.474 --> 00:34:35.014
wooden barrel on earth. The, the first uh

574
00:34:35.023 --> 00:34:39.028
cask um the first barrels uh to store wine uh

575
00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:43.378
appeared. Uh We have some archaeological data and we

576
00:34:43.387 --> 00:34:45.548
have some text appeared during the first century BC.

577
00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:51.068
So basically 300 years after the Eugene's life. So

578
00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:53.108
he has never lived in a barrel in Athens.

579
00:34:53.117 --> 00:34:57.048
He lived in a jar and this jar is uh

580
00:34:57.148 --> 00:34:59.208
uh is uh at the same time, a kind

581
00:34:59.217 --> 00:35:01.938
of um he is reflecting the place of the,

582
00:35:01.947 --> 00:35:06.657
the role of ceramic stuff in everyday life. There

583
00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:09.550
is a lot of ceramic uh vessel in uh in

584
00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:13.449
uh everyday life in Athens. At the time,

585
00:35:13.458 --> 00:35:16.898
there is a huge ceramic uh production area in the

586
00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:21.989
north of uh of Athens called Krauss. Mhm.

587
00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:25.050
And of course, as a foreigner and a mendicant

588
00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:29.849
philosopher back then, of course, he had very

589
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.349
low social status. But I guess that a class

590
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.019
of people that probably were even lower in social status

591
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.610
than him were the slaves. And so, because

592
00:35:39.619 --> 00:35:44.188
we've already mentioned, hear that he was a slave

593
00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:46.510
in himself for a while. What ideas did he

594
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:50.128
have about slaves? I mean, how did they

595
00:35:50.139 --> 00:35:52.119
think about them? Did they think that they were

596
00:35:52.128 --> 00:35:57.378
like other common citizens? They, they were the

597
00:35:57.389 --> 00:36:01.289
same as other people or not? Yeah. The

598
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.628
, the uh uh to diogenes mind it is status

599
00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:09.019
is irrelevant in a way. So you are as

600
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.090
free as you want to be, whatever is your

601
00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:16.148
status. So there is no like a political claim

602
00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:21.628
uh against, against slavery. Um But the idea

603
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.978
is that you um what is interesting uh diogenes is

604
00:36:23.989 --> 00:36:29.590
less slavery than dependence. You are um you are

605
00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:32.099
free if you do not depend, if you don't

606
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:37.978
depend of any kind of uh uh specific uh need

607
00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:42.340
. So you have to, to build uh the

608
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:45.728
strongest autonomy, you can the strongest freedom and this

609
00:36:45.739 --> 00:36:49.978
you can do inside a slave life. So the

610
00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:52.938
fact that you are a slave doesn't mean that you

611
00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:57.739
cannot live a philosophical life in diogenes uh point of

612
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.789
view. So uh slavery in a way is not

613
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.458
a very um important matter in a way that uh

614
00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:07.409
cynics use it mainly as a model as a metaphorical

615
00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:10.168
model to dependence. You are, the point is

616
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:14.820
to try not to be depend of dependent of anything

617
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:16.800
. Meaning that if you are a master and if

618
00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:22.019
you own many slaves, but if your full life

619
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.389
depends on your slave, if you are unable to

620
00:37:24.398 --> 00:37:27.510
do anything by yourself, and if you have a

621
00:37:27.519 --> 00:37:31.260
level of comfort that is uh strongly based on the

622
00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:34.708
way you own slave, you are in fact more

623
00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:37.239
a slave than your slaves. So, so in

624
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.570
uh in diogenes point of view, again, it's

625
00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:42.510
a question of uh we would say to the per

626
00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:44.918
personal development. Uh you, you, you have

627
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.949
to be able to uh to build uh a kind

628
00:37:47.958 --> 00:37:51.289
of space of freedom in your life. Whatever is

629
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.500
your status. Of course, if you have a

630
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.175
free status, it will be easier, but uh

631
00:37:55.184 --> 00:38:00.293
it will come with more obligations sometimes. So maybe

632
00:38:00.304 --> 00:38:01.474
it will be more difficult in a way. So

633
00:38:01.485 --> 00:38:05.364
when you say that uh slaves are even a harder

634
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:08.655
situation that uh um foreigners, in fact with uh

635
00:38:08.664 --> 00:38:12.784
beggars, we, we could ask the question because

636
00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:15.449
in a way laves there are some uh they have

637
00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:19.199
some reciprocal relationship with the master with all the slaves

638
00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:21.800
. So they can, they can have kind of

639
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:25.239
uh some protections in a way that beggars won't get

640
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:30.478
from anyone. So, so sometimes uh slaved as

641
00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:34.679
other better lives than beggars or may maybe a more

642
00:38:34.688 --> 00:38:37.500
protected one even. Mhm Yeah. Perhaps I was

643
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.820
thinking more about the sort of modern point of view

644
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:45.938
where being a slave would be worse than being a

645
00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:51.659
beggar because at least the beggar would have more freedom

646
00:38:52.188 --> 00:38:52.809
. Yeah. Yeah. But you're on paper,

647
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.969
you're absolutely right on paper. The, the worst

648
00:38:55.978 --> 00:38:59.449
stages is to be a state. But the thing

649
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:01.860
is in everyday life, some slaves have uh money

650
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.619
, have a comfort, comfortable life and can be

651
00:39:06.628 --> 00:39:07.898
protected. Meaning if they have a value to their

652
00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:10.628
master and if they are molested by someone, the

653
00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:15.050
master will prosecute injustice for them. So uh uh

654
00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.369
which that this is something that nobody will do for

655
00:39:17.378 --> 00:39:21.300
a be so, so uh so um that's a

656
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:24.079
complex situation. That's a complex situation. So,

657
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:30.809
getting into other aspects of diogenes philosophy, it is

658
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:36.789
pleasure, a legitimate desire for diogenes and the cynics

659
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.349
more generally. Um All the cynics didn't have the

660
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.340
same uh opinion about that. Antinous uh with a

661
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:52.019
kind of master of Diogenes. Um Antus was refusing

662
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.179
pleasure at least as far as we can understand antinous

663
00:39:55.619 --> 00:40:00.860
philosophical proposal. So, uh which uh Diogenes didn't

664
00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:04.610
do uh part of life. Uh So uh scenic

665
00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:08.148
philosophy with diogenes and after diogenes is not uh um

666
00:40:08.159 --> 00:40:12.469
refusal of pleasure, philosophy. Um the thing is

667
00:40:12.478 --> 00:40:15.269
again, is the question of autonomy and dependence.

668
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.840
Pleasure is a problem. If you are dependent of

669
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:22.438
a pleasure, you can drink some wine. But

670
00:40:22.449 --> 00:40:25.219
if you need to drink wine every, every week

671
00:40:25.228 --> 00:40:28.628
or at every banquet. There is a problem.

672
00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:30.409
You can have a sexual life. But, uh

673
00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:34.239
, if you are addicted to it, it's a

674
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:36.668
problem. You can, you have the right to

675
00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:38.780
love food and to enjoy a good piece of bread

676
00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:42.050
and nice olive oil. It's no problem with that

677
00:40:42.059 --> 00:40:45.668
. But again, if you cannot live without it

678
00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:47.110
, then it's a problem. So, pleasure is

679
00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:52.199
not in itself, um, uh, has no

680
00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:54.260
moral issue or ethical issue in itself. The question

681
00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:59.478
is uh if you are dependent of one or other

682
00:40:59.489 --> 00:41:04.179
kind of pleasure and, and how did they think

683
00:41:04.188 --> 00:41:07.909
about other animals? Did they see? Did they

684
00:41:07.918 --> 00:41:09.918
look in any way at other animals as a possible

685
00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:15.320
model for human conduct? At least to some extent

686
00:41:15.878 --> 00:41:19.219
? Yes. Uh Yeah, the, the the

687
00:41:19.228 --> 00:41:22.340
animals are model to uh to scenic uh meaning that

688
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:27.530
uh they have an ability uh to uh simplicity,

689
00:41:27.539 --> 00:41:30.559
to oar to uh frugality, which is much bigger

690
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.539
than men. So in the scenic point of view

691
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:36.378
, you have gods on the top, you have

692
00:41:36.389 --> 00:41:38.840
animals in the middle and you have men in the

693
00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:43.349
bottom. So that's the cynic hierarchy of the uh

694
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.688
world in a way. And then you have um

695
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:52.648
wise uh men, philosophers that sometimes uh can be

696
00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:55.449
higher than the animals, but lower than the gods

697
00:41:55.458 --> 00:42:00.719
like in between. But uh for normal um animals

698
00:42:00.728 --> 00:42:04.260
are supposed to be a model first because they live

699
00:42:04.269 --> 00:42:07.000
a life of simplicity. They don't have so many

700
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.800
needs uh and they adjust uh their uh needs to

701
00:42:10.809 --> 00:42:14.739
their means. Um So they live a life of

702
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.989
, of frugality and then some specific animals in the

703
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.849
scenic point of view, like dogs will have some

704
00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.688
uh uh qualities uh uh that should be inspiring.

705
00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:28.840
Uh dogs are low. Uh They are honest.

706
00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:30.530
Uh they are, again, they live a simple

707
00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:32.309
, very simple life so you can give them a

708
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.059
bone and they will be very happy with that.

709
00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:38.489
So, uh the, the idea is that the

710
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:44.119
animal world and some of the animals specifically uh can

711
00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.648
be used as a model for, for human conduct

712
00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:51.090
. Yes. Mhm. And related some other,

713
00:42:51.099 --> 00:42:53.329
let's say norms in Greek society. Of course,

714
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.449
we've already talked a little bit here about marriage for

715
00:42:57.458 --> 00:43:01.289
example. But what worries views exactly about things like

716
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:08.989
marriage, pity and prostitution. Um So marriage is

717
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.958
a cultural construct in a scenic point of view.

718
00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:15.829
So you are uh you are not supposed to try

719
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.949
to get married. So we have one exception.

720
00:43:16.958 --> 00:43:22.148
Uh uh one of diogenes pupils, Krates who got

721
00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:24.260
married with Hipaa. But it was a very strange

722
00:43:24.269 --> 00:43:30.668
marriage was basically unbuilding every rule of uh marriage.

723
00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:32.489
So it's not very classical uh marriage, you could

724
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.789
say. So, uh marriage is a social convention

725
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.500
. Uh pacy is, it's a very common practice

726
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.389
in Athens in the fourth century BC, meaning that

727
00:43:43.449 --> 00:43:45.510
uh uh for me, for most of men,

728
00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:47.349
adult men, I mean, free men citizen or

729
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.590
foreigner, but free men. Uh It was normal

730
00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:54.750
to, um, you had like basically two sexual

731
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.289
options on the table if I could say that,

732
00:43:58.478 --> 00:44:01.599
um, women and boys when I say boys,

733
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.398
I mean, uh, boys, uh which are

734
00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.349
not adults yet. So let's say 10 to 20

735
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.510
boys if you want 20 years boys. Um So

736
00:44:10.519 --> 00:44:14.800
this was considered as a kind of too equal uh

737
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:17.769
possibility to, uh, to live a sexual life

738
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.320
. And you, lots of men were leaving the

739
00:44:21.329 --> 00:44:23.639
both possibilities in parallel. Uh So this is a

740
00:44:23.648 --> 00:44:28.938
very common way uh um to, to do things

741
00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:30.688
. Uh But we have no uh not a single

742
00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:36.599
detail about any pistic relationship of diogenes. The only

743
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.340
anecdotes we have around that are presenting him as a

744
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:43.958
kind of protector of kids. Uh Not someone who

745
00:44:43.969 --> 00:44:46.469
was uh using them, using them for pleasure or

746
00:44:46.478 --> 00:44:51.168
not someone who was using pacy as a way to

747
00:44:51.179 --> 00:44:53.579
educate kids because that's why that's the way Greeks were

748
00:44:53.889 --> 00:45:00.398
describing this social practice, a way to um get

749
00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:05.519
boys to become uh citizens, adults through a personal

750
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:09.228
, intimate and intellectual relationship. Uh So, uh

751
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.159
to, to no marriage, basically, no pity

752
00:45:14.139 --> 00:45:16.208
and uh with prostitution. Uh You asked, uh

753
00:45:16.219 --> 00:45:20.320
we know that he had a personal relationship with the

754
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:24.579
Athenian uh prostitute but not uh um not a relationship

755
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.918
involving money. So it was not as far as

756
00:45:27.929 --> 00:45:30.110
we know, it was not a commercial trade uh

757
00:45:30.119 --> 00:45:34.550
relationship. It was a kind of uh love uh

758
00:45:34.739 --> 00:45:38.429
uh normal, intimate personal uh relationship. So,

759
00:45:38.539 --> 00:45:43.550
uh um again, with prostitution uh in diogenes uh

760
00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:46.000
conception, apart from his personal life, the,

761
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.398
the question is the level of dependence. So he

762
00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:52.320
was making fun of people were going on a regular

763
00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:57.659
basis to see prostitutes because in diogene ice and in

764
00:45:57.668 --> 00:46:00.099
scenic Ice, this was a red flag. It

765
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.099
meant that you were, you were dependent of it

766
00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:05.309
, of this kind of pleasure. And this was

767
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.019
a problem in a philosophical point of view. If

768
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.478
you cannot live without it, then you have to

769
00:46:10.489 --> 00:46:15.139
uh to face the philosophical issue. It is.

770
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.809
Mhm And what were his views on athletic competition?

771
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:27.208
Exercise and health? Um So, so maybe there

772
00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:29.500
are two parts. Uh the, the, the

773
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.039
, the, the, the exercise uh is uh

774
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.688
good in a cen point of view, you are

775
00:46:34.699 --> 00:46:37.300
supposed to uh exercise your body because your body is

776
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:43.010
the main tool of your everyday philosophy. So you

777
00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:44.599
are supposed to be uh to try to be in

778
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.938
good shape, to uh to strengthen your, your

779
00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:50.590
, your body, to train it. Uh And

780
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:53.699
diogenes was known to um even to twist some athletic

781
00:46:53.708 --> 00:46:58.269
exercises like uh uh what you would say, I

782
00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.610
am not sure what is the English word to say

783
00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:04.289
that like there was some uh gym, gymnastic exercises

784
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.340
with statue, like statue grabbing, you were working

785
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:09.918
with statue with positions, statues that were in the

786
00:47:09.929 --> 00:47:15.760
gymnasium. And instead of using it for wrestling techniques

787
00:47:15.059 --> 00:47:19.789
to, to train some wrestling techniques and attitudes,

788
00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:22.918
diogenes was using these statues when they were covered with

789
00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:28.708
snow in winter to grab them and to uh um

790
00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:32.349
train to resist to the cold. So, uh

791
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.510
and that's a good anecdote because it's showing that at

792
00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:40.679
the same time to exercise your body, to strengthen

793
00:47:40.688 --> 00:47:45.978
your body was important, but it was not to

794
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.289
uh uh to prepare to some competition or to improve

795
00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.099
in some very specific technical uh sport. And that's

796
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.219
why I was saying that there are like two parts

797
00:47:55.228 --> 00:47:58.889
to the answer. The first thing is health is

798
00:47:58.898 --> 00:48:00.659
important because the body has to be strong to help

799
00:48:00.668 --> 00:48:06.409
the philosophy. But then sport athletes competition, that's

800
00:48:06.418 --> 00:48:09.309
something that has a very uh strong uh and uh

801
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:16.250
unfavorable opinion because uh competition again is um a frame

802
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.148
to search for glory. So uh athletes are focused

803
00:48:21.239 --> 00:48:23.949
on the search for glory uh which is a problem

804
00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:25.679
in a phys view. We, we talked about

805
00:48:25.688 --> 00:48:30.079
it and the second is they are uh so focused

806
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.869
on that, that they are only training their body

807
00:48:31.878 --> 00:48:36.168
and they are not um having a kind of uh

808
00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:40.239
um intellectual uh development of education in parallel. So

809
00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.300
in diogenes point of view, uh the problem with

810
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:46.119
athletics is at the same time, the obsession for

811
00:48:46.128 --> 00:48:50.820
victory and the, the fact that you neglect to

812
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:52.728
develop your mind and not only your, your,

813
00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:57.760
your body So the, the view on uh exercise

814
00:48:57.769 --> 00:49:01.019
is positive but the view on athletics is negative.

815
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.780
And of course, another interesting thing about diogenes is

816
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:12.219
that he was all about speaking one's mind freely and

817
00:49:12.228 --> 00:49:17.760
sometimes that would entail insulting reprimanding sarcasm. So te

818
00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:22.849
tell us about that. Um Yeah, that's one

819
00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.289
of the, um, maybe most interesting part of

820
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.829
the philosophy of uh cynics are in a way.

821
00:49:30.898 --> 00:49:32.860
Um They, they, they consider, they have

822
00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:35.510
a kind of mission you could say. So they

823
00:49:35.519 --> 00:49:38.909
are trying to get more people come to philosophy,

824
00:49:38.918 --> 00:49:44.188
philosophical ideas, philosophical attitude and, and life.

825
00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:49.179
So you have to go to people and to provide

826
00:49:49.188 --> 00:49:52.389
some philosophical experience by talking with them by dialogue,

827
00:49:52.398 --> 00:49:58.349
et cetera. Uh including insult, including uh sarcasm

828
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.590
. Every way is good to uh to um to

829
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:06.260
force people to philosophy. So the, that's,

830
00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:07.760
that's really a kind of philosophy with uh no old

831
00:50:07.769 --> 00:50:09.349
bar in a way that you, you, you

832
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.059
, you uh cynic philosophers consider they have the right

833
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:19.159
to do everything if it helps philosophy or if it

834
00:50:19.168 --> 00:50:22.369
helps someone to come to philosophy. So they will

835
00:50:22.378 --> 00:50:27.478
use every means to provoke philosophical conversation, philosophical uh

836
00:50:27.489 --> 00:50:30.280
situations. The key principle is uh what the Greek

837
00:50:30.289 --> 00:50:34.250
called parea, meaning, meaning, uh uh freedom

838
00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.860
of speech, speaking freely, speaking tersely, uh

839
00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:42.780
uh speaking with no um specific courts of any kind

840
00:50:43.119 --> 00:50:45.909
. Uh Because Cortesi is a social convention on what

841
00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:49.878
you have to do is to force people to understand

842
00:50:49.889 --> 00:50:52.168
they are not living a life of philosophy and to

843
00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:54.878
try to convince them to, to try to live

844
00:50:54.889 --> 00:50:58.739
a philosophical life. So, yes, that is

845
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.639
uh uh one of the main tools of uh cynics

846
00:51:02.648 --> 00:51:06.188
when they try to convince other people to come to

847
00:51:06.199 --> 00:51:09.699
philosophy is uh freedom of speech, Parecia. So

848
00:51:09.739 --> 00:51:14.878
uh very, sometimes very aggressive way to uh to

849
00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:16.820
get in contact with people. And do you think

850
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:22.610
that his defense of speaking one's mind and being honest

851
00:51:22.619 --> 00:51:28.398
relates in any way with these hate toward demagogues and

852
00:51:28.409 --> 00:51:31.398
populists? Yes, you, you could say that

853
00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:36.269
you could say that um the thing is uh populist

854
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.590
uh in uh uh political life of uh cities,

855
00:51:38.599 --> 00:51:42.159
big cities or little cities, but mainly big cities

856
00:51:42.168 --> 00:51:45.000
like Athens. Um There are people who are trying

857
00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:49.050
to get some political power. Um And we are

858
00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:52.869
ready to say whatever citizens uh want to hear.

859
00:51:52.969 --> 00:51:57.378
So, uh the main uh tool of a populist

860
00:51:57.389 --> 00:52:00.969
is to lie uh to life, to get uh

861
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:02.429
the power you want to get to, to be

862
00:52:02.438 --> 00:52:06.969
able to uh decide of some uh of the political

863
00:52:06.978 --> 00:52:09.239
lines of the community. So, uh at the

864
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.829
same time, they are lying, which is uh

865
00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.849
in a scenic point of view, uh not an

866
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.559
appropriate way of behaving. And at the same time

867
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.958
, they are pursuing an artificial goal which is power

868
00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.110
. Uh So they behave dishonestly on the search for

869
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:30.050
uh something which is uh in fact useless. So

870
00:52:30.059 --> 00:52:31.949
for these two reasons, uh you, you could

871
00:52:31.958 --> 00:52:37.458
say that uh um to speak one's mind is in

872
00:52:37.469 --> 00:52:40.860
contradiction with the populist uh model. So the scenic

873
00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:44.668
way of speaking, one's mind is in contradiction with

874
00:52:44.679 --> 00:52:46.349
the, with the populist and demagogue model. Yes

875
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.099
. And, and there are certain very curious supposed

876
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:57.280
episodes in diogenes life, like for example, his

877
00:52:57.289 --> 00:53:01.840
supposed encounter with Alexander, the great that people disseminate

878
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:05.719
a lot, but we are actually not sure if

879
00:53:05.728 --> 00:53:10.389
that really happened, right? Uh Yeah, we

880
00:53:10.398 --> 00:53:13.409
cannot be sure. The thing is the, the

881
00:53:13.418 --> 00:53:15.099
question is, do we have reason to believe it

882
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.929
happened? That's, that's the main question we could

883
00:53:17.978 --> 00:53:21.530
, we could ask. Yes. Uh And uh

884
00:53:21.539 --> 00:53:23.429
yes, we have reason to believe the met.

885
00:53:23.639 --> 00:53:29.059
Uh First Alexander had a strong interest uh to philosophy

886
00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:31.728
. He's been educated partly by Aristotle and he made

887
00:53:31.739 --> 00:53:35.840
several, he met, sorry, several philosophers through

888
00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:37.628
his lives. For example, Kates when he,

889
00:53:37.639 --> 00:53:40.708
when he was in t uh et cetera. And

890
00:53:40.719 --> 00:53:45.340
uh so uh if Alexander had an opportunity to meet

891
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:50.030
Diogenes, there is no reason to doubt that they

892
00:53:50.039 --> 00:53:52.909
didn't meet. And the thing is they had some

893
00:53:52.918 --> 00:53:59.019
opportunities mainly during the 303 100 in 338 when Diogenes

894
00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.429
was involved in the Kona battle in which Alexander was

895
00:54:02.438 --> 00:54:07.070
involved too. Uh And in 336 2 years later

896
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.599
, uh Diogenes was during a part of the year

897
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:13.208
in Athens during the other part of the year in

898
00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:17.250
Corinth. And Alexander went during that year in those

899
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.500
two cities and even twice in Corinth during that year

900
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.059
. So yes, to answer your question clearly,

901
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:28.500
we cannot be sure, but we have many good

902
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.820
reasons Alexander would have been interested to meet theogenes.

903
00:54:31.148 --> 00:54:36.769
He had several opportunities to do it. And we

904
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.269
have text describing the uh the encounter, of course

905
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.719
, the the the texts are describing the encounter in

906
00:54:43.728 --> 00:54:47.260
a very legend way. So, so uh behind

907
00:54:47.269 --> 00:54:49.918
your question, I think that's, that's what you

908
00:54:49.929 --> 00:54:51.570
mean. Is there, is there a part of

909
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:52.300
legend in here? And yes, there, there

910
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:55.590
is, there must be a part of legend in

911
00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:59.389
it. And the legend goes quite far because the

912
00:54:59.398 --> 00:55:00.869
legend tells us that they died the same day.

913
00:55:01.179 --> 00:55:05.648
Uh So they are supposed to have died the same

914
00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:08.030
day. We know exactly when uh Alexander died during

915
00:55:08.039 --> 00:55:10.500
the night of the 10th to the 11th of June

916
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:15.079
323. We have no clue for diogenes. We

917
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:19.188
have some reason to believe he's dead during the 300

918
00:55:19.199 --> 00:55:22.628
twenties, maybe in 323. This is possible,

919
00:55:22.639 --> 00:55:25.599
but we have no detail and clearly this detail,

920
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:29.260
the idea that they are, they died at the

921
00:55:29.269 --> 00:55:31.398
exact same day. This is a part of the

922
00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:36.679
legend, Greeks love this kind of uh synchronic events

923
00:55:36.688 --> 00:55:40.329
or alleged synchronic events. So there are some parts

924
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:44.969
that are completely probable and some parts that are um

925
00:55:44.978 --> 00:55:47.789
likely legends. But, but when diogenes died,

926
00:55:49.019 --> 00:55:51.769
I mean, as, at least as far as

927
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.628
we know, we must have been in his,

928
00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:58.429
uh, like early eighties or something like that.

929
00:55:59.418 --> 00:56:00.889
Yeah, we have, we don't know, we

930
00:56:00.898 --> 00:56:05.010
have different information about the date of birth. So

931
00:56:05.019 --> 00:56:07.869
I wouldn't, uh, give a precise age but

932
00:56:07.878 --> 00:56:10.289
we know he was around 80 a bit more than

933
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.929
, uh, 80. Yes. Uh, absolutely

934
00:56:13.938 --> 00:56:15.489
. Uh, it's difficult to be more uh more

935
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.458
precise. Yeah, because we don't know when he

936
00:56:17.469 --> 00:56:20.909
died and we don't know when he's born. So

937
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.938
, yeah. And by the way, when it

938
00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:27.500
comes to his death, how did he die?

939
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:31.378
And in this particular case, what does it matter

940
00:56:31.389 --> 00:56:35.750
? Uh uh the the way a philosopher dies does

941
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.708
it matter and why? Yes. So, so

942
00:56:38.719 --> 00:56:40.360
, so for the first part of your question,

943
00:56:40.369 --> 00:56:46.168
we have several um versions of his death with different

944
00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:51.699
, different dates and different context. So uh for

945
00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:52.418
the way he died, we have at least four

946
00:56:52.429 --> 00:56:54.750
different version. One saying that he died of eating

947
00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:00.010
a raw octopus uh trying to demonstrate that cooking was

948
00:57:00.019 --> 00:57:02.750
useless. Um Why one that he died of an

949
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:07.010
infection after being bitten by dogs with which he was

950
00:57:07.019 --> 00:57:12.300
disputing a piece of octopus. Uh One telling us

951
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:15.590
that he died of self suffocation uh on the car

952
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.918
in Khan, on the heel of the car in

953
00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:21.789
Khan with his own cloak. Um One telling us

954
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.659
that he died of fever So of course, he

955
00:57:23.668 --> 00:57:28.519
cannot um he, he cannot have been uh killed

956
00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:30.398
by these four reasons. So most of them are

957
00:57:30.409 --> 00:57:32.840
wrong, maybe all of them, which is likely

958
00:57:34.128 --> 00:57:37.869
uh he might have just died of age. He

959
00:57:37.878 --> 00:57:39.550
was a very old man. And uh so we

960
00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:42.079
have, we have no clue. But I think

961
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:44.389
is why do we have so many legends? Because

962
00:57:44.398 --> 00:57:46.300
exactly that's the question you ask is, is there

963
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:49.708
a physical way of dying? And this is,

964
00:57:49.719 --> 00:57:52.909
these legends are a way to express the idea that

965
00:57:52.918 --> 00:57:55.329
there is a philosophical way of uh of dying in

966
00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.829
ancient times. The death of a philosopher is supposed

967
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.139
to be uh the the last uh demonstration of his

968
00:58:04.148 --> 00:58:07.340
philosophy. So uh we have lots of anecdotes,

969
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:14.378
biographical anecdotes about philosopher showing that they were um uh

970
00:58:14.699 --> 00:58:17.599
either very close to their philosophy when they die when

971
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.519
they died or on the contrary, extremely far from

972
00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:25.938
their philosophy are in contradiction with their philosophy when they

973
00:58:25.989 --> 00:58:28.989
, when they died. So there is a uh

974
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.360
very uh there's a huge interest in the scientific uh

975
00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:37.090
ancient world about the death of uh philosophers because again

976
00:58:37.099 --> 00:58:42.250
, this is this idea that philosophy uh can be

977
00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.000
demonstrated through your actions and your death is in a

978
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.619
way the last even it's the last even of your

979
00:58:47.628 --> 00:58:51.708
life. Did you leave it in a philosophical way

980
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:53.539
or did you not? And diogenes is not an

981
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:58.539
exception. The legends around his life are in a

982
00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.739
way exploring the idea of, did he, did

983
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:05.378
he live a scenic death or not? Yeah.

984
00:59:05.389 --> 00:59:08.418
The, there's also that, uh tale II,

985
00:59:08.429 --> 00:59:10.469
I would call it a tale because I am not

986
00:59:10.478 --> 00:59:14.679
100% sure if it's true or not, but about

987
00:59:14.688 --> 00:59:19.119
epicurus where I mean, because of the way he

988
00:59:19.128 --> 00:59:22.708
fought about that and now we shouldn't fear death that

989
00:59:22.878 --> 00:59:27.989
he apparently, he died with a very severe illness

990
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.619
and he apparently was suffering a lot. But because

991
00:59:30.628 --> 00:59:34.030
of his idea of death, he should have died

992
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:37.090
peacefully. Right. Yeah, exactly. That's another

993
00:59:37.099 --> 00:59:38.958
example, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, you

994
00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:42.739
have, in fact, uh lots of examples that

995
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.559
have been gathered by a French researcher some years ago

996
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.860
in an article Lucien Jaron, which it's an article

997
00:59:47.869 --> 00:59:51.570
in French, which is uh the southern, the

998
00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:54.289
southern way of death of dying of ancient philosophers.

999
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.699
So, yes, you're right there, there are

1000
00:59:55.708 --> 00:60:00.913
lots of examples and some of them are dying exactly

1001
00:60:00.922 --> 00:60:02.291
the way you are. They are expected to die

1002
00:60:02.302 --> 00:60:06.342
and others are like uh in full contradiction. So

1003
00:60:06.353 --> 00:60:07.572
it's, it's a, it's a, it's a

1004
00:60:07.583 --> 00:60:12.311
way, it's a funny part of the philosophical history

1005
00:60:12.322 --> 00:60:15.443
of philosophy, if I could say by the way

1006
00:60:15.452 --> 00:60:20.335
, in, in what ways did die is relate

1007
00:60:20.344 --> 00:60:23.364
philosophically intellectually, of course, to some of the

1008
00:60:23.375 --> 00:60:30.686
other very prominent Greek philosophers like Socrates and Plato,

1009
00:60:30.695 --> 00:60:35.324
they, they have something to say about their philosophy

1010
00:60:35.335 --> 00:60:38.554
or the, their way of doing philosophy or something

1011
00:60:38.565 --> 00:60:44.679
like that. Yeah. Uh wi with uh um

1012
00:60:44.688 --> 00:60:45.898
Diogenes as far as we know, as a kind

1013
00:60:45.909 --> 00:60:52.519
of uh um very critic uh opinion about Socrates and

1014
00:60:52.530 --> 00:60:59.438
extremely critic uh opinion about Plato. Uh the,

1015
00:60:59.449 --> 00:61:01.579
the that uh he was considering Plato that a kind

1016
00:61:01.590 --> 00:61:07.438
of um ne negation of uh of the principle of

1017
00:61:07.449 --> 00:61:09.579
uh philosophy in action. The, the main critic

1018
00:61:09.668 --> 00:61:14.320
Diogenes was uh uh doing at uh uh Plato and

1019
00:61:14.329 --> 00:61:15.949
Plato's philosophy. That was that he was not living

1020
00:61:15.958 --> 00:61:20.438
a life of philosophy. It was just like producing

1021
00:61:20.449 --> 00:61:22.800
philosophical ideas, but you couldn't see. And then

1022
00:61:23.059 --> 00:61:27.648
in his uh everyday uh life, so he wasn't

1023
00:61:27.659 --> 00:61:30.030
, he was useless in, in Diogenes's point of

1024
00:61:30.039 --> 00:61:31.820
view, plateau was uh uh was useless. And

1025
00:61:31.829 --> 00:61:35.260
he says that he said something like uh of what's

1026
00:61:35.269 --> 00:61:36.639
used for us. He is a man who's been

1027
00:61:36.648 --> 00:61:39.320
philosophy for uh so long and has yet not upset

1028
00:61:39.329 --> 00:61:42.579
uh anyone. So he was considering him as a

1029
00:61:42.590 --> 00:61:46.655
kind of a lost cause someone was producing very high

1030
00:61:46.664 --> 00:61:51.514
level philosophical ideas, but that we are not grounded

1031
00:61:51.655 --> 00:61:55.103
. So that was the main critic. And about

1032
00:61:55.114 --> 00:61:58.445
, you know, the idea of the human being

1033
00:61:58.454 --> 00:62:00.195
, the way a plateau defined what is a human

1034
00:62:00.204 --> 00:62:04.260
being. So, meaning a biped uh with no

1035
00:62:04.269 --> 00:62:07.989
leaves um with no feathers, sorry with no feathers

1036
00:62:07.199 --> 00:62:12.978
. Um And then uh uh Theogenes says the legend

1037
00:62:12.989 --> 00:62:15.898
uh took a rooster plucked, the, the rooster

1038
00:62:15.909 --> 00:62:21.469
came to the um to uh Plato's gymnasium and said

1039
00:62:21.478 --> 00:62:23.539
this is Plato's human being uh to, to,

1040
00:62:23.550 --> 00:62:28.070
to make fun to the, this kind of philosophical

1041
00:62:28.079 --> 00:62:31.619
corpus. So, uh Diogenes was i, in

1042
00:62:31.628 --> 00:62:37.719
that way, he was positioning himself against uh plateau's

1043
00:62:37.728 --> 00:62:40.090
school that he considered as a kind of very theoretical

1044
00:62:40.099 --> 00:62:44.809
philosophy and not a philosophy in action. Mhm.

1045
00:62:45.280 --> 00:62:50.478
And uh do we know if Biogen wrote a lot

1046
00:62:50.489 --> 00:62:52.719
? Uh I mean, did he write at all

1047
00:62:52.458 --> 00:62:55.260
? Uh as far as we know he did,

1048
00:62:55.369 --> 00:63:00.070
he did uh essays uh Economic Treaties Tragedies too.

1049
00:63:00.159 --> 00:63:05.280
We have two long lists of his opera. Uh

1050
00:63:05.289 --> 00:63:08.398
They are not exactly identical. There are reasons for

1051
00:63:08.409 --> 00:63:12.398
that but maybe I won't go so far in the

1052
00:63:12.409 --> 00:63:14.789
conversation. But, but uh uh we have no

1053
00:63:14.800 --> 00:63:16.559
reason to doubt that he wrote. He wrote meaning

1054
00:63:16.570 --> 00:63:20.489
that he must have had some kind of material support

1055
00:63:20.500 --> 00:63:22.849
, material help. Uh because you need some scrolls

1056
00:63:22.860 --> 00:63:24.590
, you need, you need to have some material

1057
00:63:24.599 --> 00:63:27.780
to write in ancient times like today, I could

1058
00:63:27.789 --> 00:63:30.289
say. Uh but yes, he, he wrote

1059
00:63:30.300 --> 00:63:34.829
, he used writing to develop his ideas including tragedies

1060
00:63:34.840 --> 00:63:37.659
again, Seattle. Uh But the thing is we

1061
00:63:37.668 --> 00:63:39.570
, we lost everything basically apart from a, a

1062
00:63:39.579 --> 00:63:45.728
big fragment of his uh um uh Political Philosophy Treaty

1063
00:63:45.739 --> 00:63:47.688
uh polit that we, we, we, we

1064
00:63:47.699 --> 00:63:50.570
, we, which is, which has been saved

1065
00:63:50.579 --> 00:63:52.489
by Philo Dema of Garra and quoted. But apart

1066
00:63:52.500 --> 00:63:55.360
from that, we lost uh most of his text

1067
00:63:55.369 --> 00:64:00.250
. So we know his philosophy from uh his uh

1068
00:64:00.289 --> 00:64:03.280
Apotex. And for his um sayings, so the

1069
00:64:03.378 --> 00:64:06.050
, the, the big part of his philosophy,

1070
00:64:06.059 --> 00:64:10.860
we, we grasp it, we get uh it's

1071
00:64:10.869 --> 00:64:15.599
true uh anecdotes, uh meetings, encounters and the

1072
00:64:15.610 --> 00:64:18.320
dialogues he had with uh some people. So some

1073
00:64:18.329 --> 00:64:23.039
of these sayings are, must have been close to

1074
00:64:23.050 --> 00:64:27.320
the truth, other are very uh rebuilt by time

1075
00:64:27.329 --> 00:64:30.599
and uh diff the different philosophical schools that use them

1076
00:64:30.878 --> 00:64:34.958
uh to defend cynicism or to attack cynicism. So

1077
00:64:34.969 --> 00:64:40.958
sometimes it's a bit difficult to see through this uh

1078
00:64:41.208 --> 00:64:45.840
uh very long and complex transmission process to get to

1079
00:64:45.849 --> 00:64:50.860
go back to the like original diogenes and which prominent

1080
00:64:50.869 --> 00:64:58.300
philosophers uh mentioned having been influenced by diogenes. And

1081
00:64:58.309 --> 00:65:01.829
I'm not just asking about the Greek and Roman philosophers

1082
00:65:01.840 --> 00:65:09.079
, but basically across history. Um And that's,

1083
00:65:09.090 --> 00:65:11.340
that's, I'm not sure I am able to fully

1084
00:65:11.349 --> 00:65:13.780
answer to the, to the question. But I

1085
00:65:13.789 --> 00:65:15.909
would, to, to my knowledge, the,

1086
00:65:15.918 --> 00:65:19.199
the um the philosopher who has been the, maybe

1087
00:65:19.208 --> 00:65:24.030
the most influenced by uh diogenes. He will be

1088
00:65:24.039 --> 00:65:28.610
Emil Cioran, the Romanian uh philosopher from the 19th

1089
00:65:28.619 --> 00:65:31.000
century. Uh a bit uh a bit after that

1090
00:65:31.010 --> 00:65:33.059
. He, he died. Uh I don't remember

1091
00:65:33.070 --> 00:65:34.510
exactly when he died. I don't know if he

1092
00:65:34.519 --> 00:65:38.039
died end of the 20th or beginning of the 21st

1093
00:65:38.050 --> 00:65:41.079
. I'm sorry, Emil C Yeah. Yeah,

1094
00:65:41.090 --> 00:65:42.918
I know, I know who you're talking about.

1095
00:65:42.929 --> 00:65:45.503
I, I just thought that he was born in

1096
00:65:45.514 --> 00:65:48.405
the 19th century but perhaps I'm wrong, maybe no

1097
00:65:48.414 --> 00:65:49.735
, I wouldn't say that. I don't think so

1098
00:65:49.744 --> 00:65:51.503
. I think he's born in the beginning of the

1099
00:65:51.514 --> 00:65:54.304
twenties. But you, you maybe, you know

1100
00:65:54.313 --> 00:65:58.244
, better. The so, so, so which

1101
00:65:58.253 --> 00:66:00.583
was a Romanian philosopher? But he lived in,

1102
00:66:00.594 --> 00:66:02.804
not in exile. But yes, he lived in

1103
00:66:02.813 --> 00:66:06.570
gold books in Romanian. Then it changed uh to

1104
00:66:06.579 --> 00:66:09.539
uh to French on the road the rest of his

1105
00:66:09.550 --> 00:66:12.769
life. Uh in um in French, he lived

1106
00:66:12.780 --> 00:66:15.918
a very simple uh life uh basically with no uh

1107
00:66:15.929 --> 00:66:20.179
family, a very poor life. He didn't work

1108
00:66:20.398 --> 00:66:25.478
. Uh He wrote mainly uh a aorist sayings.

1109
00:66:25.489 --> 00:66:29.438
So even the way he was communicating philosophy uh as

1110
00:66:29.449 --> 00:66:31.619
some has something in common with the way we know

1111
00:66:31.628 --> 00:66:36.478
uh diogenes uh philosophy. It was very critical with

1112
00:66:36.489 --> 00:66:41.869
basically uh everything in the social uh about social customs

1113
00:66:41.878 --> 00:66:45.059
, social conventions. So, um a very uh

1114
00:66:45.668 --> 00:66:51.168
uh brutal uh way of looking at uh humans and

1115
00:66:51.179 --> 00:66:55.688
their behavior and society. So, um I would

1116
00:66:55.699 --> 00:66:57.769
say maybe uh the, the, the, the

1117
00:66:57.800 --> 00:67:00.099
, the, the biggest he uh of the 20th

1118
00:67:00.110 --> 00:67:03.599
century will be em. Yes. Mhm. And

1119
00:67:03.610 --> 00:67:08.530
what about the influence that diogenes might have had on

1120
00:67:08.539 --> 00:67:11.599
stoicism? The, did, did they have an

1121
00:67:11.610 --> 00:67:14.519
influence there? Yes. Yes. Uh The first

1122
00:67:14.530 --> 00:67:16.760
influence is uh genealogy. Uh The, you know

1123
00:67:16.769 --> 00:67:20.829
, Socrates are uh antisthenes as a pupil, antitheism

1124
00:67:20.898 --> 00:67:25.208
, a diogenes as a pupil uh di direct or

1125
00:67:25.219 --> 00:67:27.938
indirect pupil. We, we are not sure that

1126
00:67:28.119 --> 00:67:31.418
depending diogenes arrived in Athens before the death of antisthenes

1127
00:67:31.869 --> 00:67:35.409
in 366 or after. We're not sure. Diogenes

1128
00:67:35.739 --> 00:67:41.000
at Ks as a pupil and CS as Z and

1129
00:67:41.010 --> 00:67:45.039
Zeno is the founder of the stoic school of South

1130
00:67:45.340 --> 00:67:47.559
. Um So there is a genealogical link. That's

1131
00:67:47.570 --> 00:67:49.469
the first thing. The second thing is there is

1132
00:67:49.478 --> 00:67:53.219
an ideological link. Yes. Uh Stoics in a

1133
00:67:53.228 --> 00:67:56.938
way are like uh civilized cynics. If you could

1134
00:67:56.949 --> 00:68:00.519
say uh Cynics, you can be in company with

1135
00:68:00.530 --> 00:68:03.489
without being insulted. Um So the the level of

1136
00:68:03.500 --> 00:68:10.090
the of provocation transgression uh exhortation to is much uh

1137
00:68:10.099 --> 00:68:13.128
lower. But there, there are some common points

1138
00:68:13.179 --> 00:68:15.590
. It's a, it's a stoic stoicism is an

1139
00:68:15.599 --> 00:68:20.079
ethic philosophy as cynicism uh virtue. The search for

1140
00:68:20.088 --> 00:68:26.359
virtue is key in uh stoicism. And uh there

1141
00:68:26.369 --> 00:68:29.359
is this idea that you, you cannot be controlled

1142
00:68:29.369 --> 00:68:32.159
by your feelings. Uh uh The cynics will say

1143
00:68:32.168 --> 00:68:35.849
that you cannot be controlled by your needs. Stoics

1144
00:68:35.858 --> 00:68:39.087
will say that you cannot be controlled by your feelings

1145
00:68:39.099 --> 00:68:41.158
, meaning you cannot be controlled by your, by

1146
00:68:41.167 --> 00:68:43.719
your pain or by your pleasure, which is a

1147
00:68:43.729 --> 00:68:46.269
common point with uh uh Cynics. Uh There is

1148
00:68:46.278 --> 00:68:49.788
another strong common point is it is a philosophy in

1149
00:68:49.797 --> 00:68:55.979
action. Stoics uh consider that the way you behave

1150
00:68:55.989 --> 00:68:59.250
is key in a philosophical point of view. Again

1151
00:68:59.259 --> 00:69:01.390
, it's not a theoretical philosophy. There is a

1152
00:69:01.399 --> 00:69:08.819
theoretical um corpus which is uh uh explaining uh analyzing

1153
00:69:08.829 --> 00:69:11.939
the, the idea of virtue, the relationship to

1154
00:69:11.949 --> 00:69:15.100
Phoenix, et cetera. But what is most important

1155
00:69:15.109 --> 00:69:17.088
is the way you uh you behave. And maybe

1156
00:69:17.100 --> 00:69:21.399
there is another element which is the relationship with nature

1157
00:69:21.409 --> 00:69:29.060
. For Stoics to understand the rules of nature is

1158
00:69:29.069 --> 00:69:32.819
key to uh choose your philosophical way of life.

1159
00:69:32.829 --> 00:69:36.189
You need to stay in contact with the rules of

1160
00:69:36.199 --> 00:69:40.180
uh nature. So, yes, there are,

1161
00:69:40.189 --> 00:69:42.890
there are lots of lots in common. But again

1162
00:69:42.899 --> 00:69:46.409
, Stoics must have been much easier to um comp

1163
00:69:46.539 --> 00:69:49.649
sti company must have been much easier and nicer than

1164
00:69:49.659 --> 00:69:51.979
Phoenix one, right? And, and by the

1165
00:69:51.989 --> 00:69:56.350
way, actually, I've asked you about stoicism specifically

1166
00:69:56.359 --> 00:70:01.583
because we've seen in recent years uh resurgence of spices

1167
00:70:01.664 --> 00:70:05.384
in popular culture actually. But uh do you look

1168
00:70:05.395 --> 00:70:13.753
at these recent resurgence uh as and as having anything

1169
00:70:13.765 --> 00:70:18.239
to do with the original sto Yeah, I don't

1170
00:70:18.250 --> 00:70:20.890
know if it's more stoicism or more cynicism, the

1171
00:70:20.899 --> 00:70:24.449
, the this uh the, the development of the

1172
00:70:24.458 --> 00:70:29.838
search of frugality, achy, um self sufficiency.

1173
00:70:29.958 --> 00:70:31.079
Um I, I think that some people will,

1174
00:70:31.088 --> 00:70:34.329
will, will uh claim to be influenced by the

1175
00:70:34.824 --> 00:70:38.944
model. Some will claim to be influenced by the

1176
00:70:38.954 --> 00:70:42.494
stoic uh model. I, I have never made

1177
00:70:42.503 --> 00:70:44.864
a kind of a full survey of the phenomenon.

1178
00:70:44.875 --> 00:70:47.954
You're right. I think it's an increasing trend movement

1179
00:70:47.963 --> 00:70:51.555
across the world of people who are trying to rethink

1180
00:70:51.918 --> 00:70:57.628
our relationship to progress. And cynics and Stoics are

1181
00:70:57.640 --> 00:71:00.890
of can be of great help to uh to rethink

1182
00:71:00.899 --> 00:71:03.220
the relationship to, to progress the idea that we

1183
00:71:03.229 --> 00:71:08.140
have to accumulate more and more to, to,

1184
00:71:08.159 --> 00:71:12.009
to produce uh more and more. Um some people

1185
00:71:12.020 --> 00:71:15.298
are trying to live a kind of decreasing uh life

1186
00:71:15.310 --> 00:71:18.239
in that uh perspective. And, and diogenes is

1187
00:71:18.250 --> 00:71:23.039
kind of uh the ultimate model of life in that

1188
00:71:23.048 --> 00:71:25.180
uh uh perspective. So, yes, there is

1189
00:71:25.189 --> 00:71:30.500
a kind of uh um uh increasing popularity of this

1190
00:71:30.509 --> 00:71:34.359
uh ancient philosophic uh movement, ancient philosophies in actions

1191
00:71:34.369 --> 00:71:38.579
uh that are more popular than they've been uh doing

1192
00:71:38.588 --> 00:71:40.958
. I would say a century ago, the popularity

1193
00:71:40.970 --> 00:71:43.418
of this movement was not the same in the,

1194
00:71:43.430 --> 00:71:45.668
in the population, not in the academic world,

1195
00:71:45.680 --> 00:71:48.539
but in the uh normal world, I would say

1196
00:71:49.239 --> 00:71:53.020
. So, one last question, then how do

1197
00:71:53.029 --> 00:71:56.930
you look basically at the legacy of diogenes? I

1198
00:71:56.939 --> 00:72:00.930
mean, how is he viewed today by philosophers in

1199
00:72:00.939 --> 00:72:10.489
general and in popular culture? Um I think there

1200
00:72:10.500 --> 00:72:15.668
is still some time um uh is still forgotten,

1201
00:72:15.680 --> 00:72:18.699
sometimes it was forgotten sometime in the ancient uh uh

1202
00:72:18.708 --> 00:72:24.199
time in antiquity. Uh Some histories of philosophy,

1203
00:72:24.208 --> 00:72:25.720
I mean, in the ancient times, uh uh

1204
00:72:25.739 --> 00:72:30.890
forgot to uh to study uh uh cynicism and it

1205
00:72:30.899 --> 00:72:32.770
still happens sometimes you have some very large book about

1206
00:72:32.779 --> 00:72:36.250
ancient philosophy. We don't uh even credit anything to

1207
00:72:36.259 --> 00:72:40.020
uh cynicism. So uh that is a kind of

1208
00:72:40.029 --> 00:72:44.708
very old uh tendency but uh things are, things

1209
00:72:44.720 --> 00:72:46.359
are changing. Uh I think in that, in

1210
00:72:46.369 --> 00:72:48.079
that matter. So that is a kind of uh

1211
00:72:48.088 --> 00:72:53.439
rehabilitation of the interest of uh cynicism because of his

1212
00:72:53.449 --> 00:72:58.220
genealogy with the Socratic philosophy and the stoic uh philosophy

1213
00:72:58.229 --> 00:73:00.159
that is a kind of rehabilitation. Uh and the

1214
00:73:00.168 --> 00:73:03.390
, the fact that we are facing this very modern

1215
00:73:03.399 --> 00:73:06.850
question of uh and the way the world is uh

1216
00:73:06.859 --> 00:73:11.819
going now and the economics, the industrial uh uh

1217
00:73:11.829 --> 00:73:13.829
issues we are, all of us are, are

1218
00:73:13.838 --> 00:73:16.159
, are facing. Uh it should, it should

1219
00:73:16.168 --> 00:73:19.659
give to uh cynicism a kind of new uh uh

1220
00:73:19.668 --> 00:73:25.759
new light on. Mhm Great. So uh the

1221
00:73:25.770 --> 00:73:29.989
book is again the Dangerous Life and ideas of diogenes

1222
00:73:30.000 --> 00:73:31.529
, the cynic. I'm leaving a link to it

1223
00:73:31.539 --> 00:73:35.168
in the description of this interview. And uh J

1224
00:73:35.239 --> 00:73:39.168
Manuel, just before we go apart from the book

1225
00:73:39.180 --> 00:73:41.199
, would you like to tell people where they can

1226
00:73:41.208 --> 00:73:45.668
find you on the internet? Uh What can you

1227
00:73:45.680 --> 00:73:48.418
mean if I have some kind of internet? Yeah

1228
00:73:48.430 --> 00:73:53.970
, like uh university page website, social media.

1229
00:73:54.149 --> 00:73:56.909
I, I have no social media page of any

1230
00:73:56.918 --> 00:73:59.829
kind. I don't have any Facebook page, Instagram

1231
00:73:59.838 --> 00:74:02.029
page, Twitter page uh or youtube channel. Uh

1232
00:74:02.039 --> 00:74:05.699
I just have a professional page uh where my uh

1233
00:74:05.739 --> 00:74:11.520
work is uh uh referred. Uh So uh when

1234
00:74:11.529 --> 00:74:14.668
I release a new uh a new study, a

1235
00:74:14.680 --> 00:74:16.859
new book, uh you, you can uh find

1236
00:74:16.869 --> 00:74:19.699
it uh there. Uh So that, that's it

1237
00:74:19.708 --> 00:74:21.850
. Basically, I'm afraid I'm not a, a

1238
00:74:21.878 --> 00:74:27.579
very electronic uh person. Uh And do you have

1239
00:74:27.588 --> 00:74:30.619

1240
00:74:30.628 --> 00:74:35.569

1241
00:74:35.579 --> 00:74:38.489
