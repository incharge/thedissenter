00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.740
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.139
the Decent. I'm your host, Ricard Loops.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.278
And today I'm joined by Doctor Steven Grossberg. He

4
00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:11.108
is Wang, professor of Cognitive and neuro Systems,

5
00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:15.398
Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Statistics, psychological and brain

6
00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.870
sciences and biomedical engineering at Boston University. And today

7
00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.420
we're focusing on one of his books, the latest

8
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.579
one. And I guess that Steve would agree with

9
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.769
me when I say that it's probably his magnum opus

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.109
conscious mind, resonant brain. How each brain makes

11
00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:38.509
a mind. So, Steve, welcome to the

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.240
show. It's an honor to everyone. Well,

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.969
it's a delight to be here and it's one of

14
00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:47.950
the wonders of modern zoom that you're in Portugal and

15
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:53.250
I'm in Newton Massachusetts. So there we go.

16
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.689
Yeah. There we go. It's modern technology,

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.009
right? Yeah. Which got really amplified greatly when

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.129
COVID happened. That's when zoom really took off.

19
00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:10.650
Yeah, that, that's totally right. So to

20
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.879
get into the topics here, then I, in

21
00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:19.730
the first few sections of your book, you get

22
00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:23.459
into how we tackle basically the brain, how we

23
00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.000
understand the brain, the mind and the relationship between

24
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.859
them and how you can do it through several different

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.870
perspectives, mostly you focus on physics and psychology.

26
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.359
So to introduce the topic, could you tell us

27
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.388
perhaps and also to add some historical background here for

28
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.629
the audience? Could you tell us how uh physics

29
00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:52.750
and psychology approach approach this issue? And historically,

30
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.838
when and how did they split in their approaches?

31
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.299
Yeah. Well, at the um in the late

32
00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:07.430
18 hundreds, uh three very great physicists Helmholtz,

33
00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:10.460
I'm sorry, Hermann, Von Helmholtz in Germany,

34
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:17.580
Clerk Maxwell in England and Ernst Mach in Austria made

35
00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:24.349
seminal contributions to psychology and neuroscience. Uh At that

36
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.288
time, if you were interested in the structure of

37
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.449
physical space and time, you would just as likely

38
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.278
try to study psychological space and time. But um

39
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.528
so they were uh interested in understanding how the observed

40
00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:49.830
world which is physics developed side by side their analysis

41
00:02:49.838 --> 00:02:54.360
of the observer, which is us. But by

42
00:02:54.368 --> 00:02:58.399
the time we got to the young Albert Einstein,

43
00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:00.899
oh, he didn't do psychology anymore. He just

44
00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.788
did physics. And I wanna quote just a little

45
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.750
thing that he wrote to his friend, Queen Elizabeth

46
00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:12.899
of Belgium in 1933 which was much later. But

47
00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.750
this was his stance throughout life that quote, most

48
00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:21.740
of us prefer to look outside rather than inside ourselves

49
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.288
. For in the latter case we see but a

50
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.758
dark hole which means nothing at all. So in

51
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.319
the late 18 hundreds of the greatest physicists did psychology

52
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.338
and physics and some neuroscience. And then Einstein who's

53
00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.199
at least is great and did only physics. And

54
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.508
the question is why. And one main reason is

55
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.788
due to the properties of the experimental data that Helmholtz

56
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.919
Maxwell and Mach uh discovered. And that data has

57
00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:03.330
characteristics that I like saying a nonlinear non stationary and

58
00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:09.669
non local. Whereas traditional physics use models that are

59
00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:13.000
linear stationary and local. So what do those words

60
00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:16.970
mean? Well, nonlinear means uh in the simplest

61
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.980
form, the whole isn't the sum of its parts

62
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:23.709
. You know, you chop us up into parts

63
00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:29.437
and life is no longer supported. But nonlinearity more

64
00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.908
technically means that you multiply variables. You don't just

65
00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:39.329
add them linear means you just add stuff non stationary

66
00:04:39.338 --> 00:04:44.139
means we're always evolving from being babies. We develop

67
00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.399
quickly and then we go on through lifelong learning and

68
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.278
non local in the sense that I'm using it means

69
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.879
that there are long range interactions between many, many

70
00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.040
neurons in our brains. And that is because these

71
00:05:01.048 --> 00:05:06.519
interactions enable our brains to understand the context and the

72
00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:10.639
objects in which we experience the world is not just

73
00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:15.088
pixel by pixel in a painting that our brains look

74
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.858
at the whole pattern which requires interactions. Uh And

75
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.129
uh the physicists just didn't have the concepts or the

76
00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.519
math to do it. And in fact, Helmholz

77
00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:33.100
, who started out deeply interested in psychology and physiology

78
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.738
ended his life only doing physics. So maybe that's

79
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.920
enough to get started. And of course, when

80
00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:46.048
I asked you here about how people from physics and

81
00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.488
psychology, for example, think about or understand the

82
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.389
brain, the mind and the relationship. I was

83
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:56.889
also at least to some extent alluding to the mind

84
00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.608
body problem. So, could you tell us what

85
00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.160
exactly is the mind body problem and why has it

86
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.600
been so difficult to tackle? Ok. Well,

87
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.869
when we think of our brain, which is a

88
00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.209
central feature in our body and the one that's relevant

89
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.720
to our discussion today, we may think of the

90
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.678
little gray cells of Hercule Poirot. I don't know

91
00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.119
if you like mysteries, but I always loved thinking

92
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:30.889
about the little gray cells, but we think of

93
00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:35.298
our mind, we may think about a beautiful sunset

94
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:40.449
, a feeling of being in love, uh you

95
00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:44.488
know, deep thoughts or poetry. And there's a

96
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.399
huge gap between those two. And the question is

97
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.009
, how do you bridge the gap? And that's

98
00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:55.970
what my magnum opus uh tries to do as reflected

99
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.509
by its title Conscious Mind Resonant Brain. How each

100
00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:03.389
brain makes a mind? How do we bridge the

101
00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.910
gap? And my book therefore, tries to have

102
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.329
a comprehensive and unified description of the main processes whereby

103
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.069
our brains make our minds. And that can be

104
00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:24.689
done because there are vast databases that were accumulated in

105
00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:30.189
psychology and neuroscience uh since the time of Helm Helmholtz

106
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.949
Maxwell and Max. So the problem wasn't um what

107
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:39.100
am I supposed to explain the problem was how can

108
00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:45.259
I find any explanation of hundreds of experiments and which

109
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:48.028
experiments cohere together? So in order to even even

110
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.899
begin this, you have to have an intuition in

111
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:58.949
which data uh are probing the same underlying processes.

112
00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:01.108
And what are those processes? So? Well,

113
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.910
we start with perception and at least two main ones

114
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.500
, visual and auditory. I won't even talk about

115
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:16.129
tactile and that goes on to cognition and emotion and

116
00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:20.790
action. And we can't just be satisfied with discussing

117
00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:26.980
how that goes on in uh healthy or typical individuals

118
00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.629
. It's important to also understand well, what happens

119
00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.389
when they break down which they do and can lead

120
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:39.629
to many clinical disorders. And in the course of

121
00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:43.840
my work, I noticed that if there's certain imbalances

122
00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:48.729
or breakdowns in the neural network processes that I used

123
00:08:48.739 --> 00:08:54.178
to model lots of uh data about typical individuals in

124
00:08:54.190 --> 00:09:00.139
a principled and unifying way. Then al popped uh

125
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:05.899
symptoms of diseases as varied as Alzheimer's disease, autism

126
00:09:07.229 --> 00:09:11.609
, medial temporal amnesia, schizophrenia, A DH D

127
00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:16.548
PTSD, auditory and visual neglect and agnosia. Even

128
00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:20.229
what goes wrong with slow wave sleep things which I

129
00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:24.090
never dreamed of. And so one of the main

130
00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:26.690
things to think about is, you know, how

131
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.710
are you forced into thinking about things you never dreamed

132
00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:33.769
you would know anything about. And more than that

133
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:41.229
um our brains operate in cycles as a perception,

134
00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:46.769
cognition, emotion action cycle where we're continually interacting with

135
00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:50.168
and adapting to a rapidly changing environment. So with

136
00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:54.830
this background, let's come down back to the mind

137
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.940
body problem. Why are they so intimately linked?

138
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:05.090
And one theme in my book and, and think

139
00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:11.379
about mind body problem is brain evolution needs to achieve

140
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:16.558
behavioral success. So the uh the meat, the

141
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.599
little gray cells, uh the body part of it

142
00:10:20.729 --> 00:10:28.639
is intimately linked through Darwinian selection to uh the mind

143
00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:31.359
part of it. Uh They, they can't be

144
00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:37.989
separated. Um So the book explains how multiple brain

145
00:10:39.408 --> 00:10:46.178
circuits and multiple brain regions interact to generate the behaviors

146
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.678
that control our day to day uh activities and mind

147
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:56.710
is what you can most efficiently call an emergent property

148
00:10:56.719 --> 00:11:00.599
, an interactive property of these brain mechanisms. And

149
00:11:00.609 --> 00:11:05.149
even Von Neumann knew that that the intelligence isn't just

150
00:11:05.158 --> 00:11:09.619
in the local interaction, it's how many of them

151
00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:15.058
interact. So why my book is unusual is that

152
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.129
most books are about mind or brain, but not

153
00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:22.019
about each brain makes a mind. And in this

154
00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:24.869
regard, I was lucky because I started my life's

155
00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:28.168
work when I was 17 years old, I was

156
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:33.330
a freshman taking introductory psychology. And there was a

157
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:39.489
lot of quantitative data about how we learn a classical

158
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.109
data, Hovland Hall. Many other Great American psychologists

159
00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:52.219
were into learning. And so my brain exploded and

160
00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:58.668
I was driven into what became neural networks uh including

161
00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:03.119
the main laws of short term memory, medium term

162
00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:05.979
memory, long term memory that people use today to

163
00:12:05.989 --> 00:12:09.700
explain how brains make minds. So because I started

164
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.340
in psychology and was forced into brain, I was

165
00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:18.460
able to make the link and then build and build

166
00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:22.700
and build with many gifted collaborators for 67 years.

167
00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:26.700
So it was a lucky start. But why my

168
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:33.408
brain exploded, I can't explain. And um so

169
00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:39.840
um and these are not traditional concepts from computer science

170
00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:45.750
, engineering or traditional symbolic A I, although now

171
00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:46.928
a lot of people call me the father of A

172
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.428
I. Because over the years when symbolic A I

173
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.918
failed, the people in IA I wanted to take

174
00:12:54.928 --> 00:12:58.739
over neural networks to be A I. Marvin Minsky

175
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.619
was one of them. And um anyway, so

176
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:07.690
I'm called the father of A I because I introduced

177
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:16.288
the modern paradigm in 1957. Um And along the

178
00:13:16.298 --> 00:13:18.038
way, you know, with all the discoveries that

179
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:24.048
just poured out uh over these years, uh it's

180
00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:28.928
not just classical stuff because I had to introduce new

181
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.849
computational paradigms to link brain to mind. And I

182
00:13:33.859 --> 00:13:41.960
call two of them complementary computing and laminar computing and

183
00:13:41.969 --> 00:13:50.519
complementary computing explains the nature of brain specialization. You

184
00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.090
know, we don't have independent modules like you don't

185
00:13:54.099 --> 00:14:00.308
first compute uh edges and then shading and then texture

186
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.349
and then depth rather. When we look at an

187
00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:05.750
object, all of these properties can be overlaid,

188
00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:11.719
we're looking at a texture depth, full object with

189
00:14:11.729 --> 00:14:16.538
contours boundaries. And so there's a lot of multiplexing

190
00:14:16.548 --> 00:14:24.729
of um properties. And so um complementary computing was

191
00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.178
a discovery I gradually made. I didn't wake up

192
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.070
one day and say, oh let's let's assume the

193
00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.979
brain as complementary computing. Now I over decades,

194
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:37.139
I we try to explain more and more data and

195
00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:41.538
in every one of them, there were complementary pairs

196
00:14:41.058 --> 00:14:48.279
of processes and a kind of Yin Yang relationship computationally

197
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:54.200
complementary until I realized it was a global design principle

198
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.639
for the brain. Like I think we might come

199
00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:00.288
to it in a while that visual boundaries and surfaces

200
00:15:00.298 --> 00:15:07.788
obey computationally complementary laws. The ventral watt stream that

201
00:15:07.798 --> 00:15:13.219
um does perception and recognition in our brain and the

202
00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:18.908
dorsal we stream that the facial representation and action obey

203
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.989
computational complementary laws. And one of them the what

204
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.690
and where is on a huge scale of atomical organization

205
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.960
and the boundaries and surfaces are much smaller. So

206
00:15:30.969 --> 00:15:41.048
you have a multilevel um uh representation of complimentary complementarity

207
00:15:41.058 --> 00:15:43.570
in all brain processes. And I mentioned lam in

208
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:52.788
a computer and laminar computing explains how all uh higher

209
00:15:52.798 --> 00:15:58.308
forms of biological intelligence are um explained by variations of

210
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.090
a single canonical Lain a circuit. I mean some

211
00:16:03.099 --> 00:16:07.129
listeners may know that if you look at uh the

212
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:14.658
Neocortex that supports vision, speech language cognition, there

213
00:16:14.668 --> 00:16:21.149
are six characteristic layers and characteristic sub lamina with characteristic

214
00:16:21.489 --> 00:16:26.469
feedback interactions and horizontal interactions. So bottom up,

215
00:16:26.479 --> 00:16:30.989
top down horizontal in all of these circuits. And

216
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.239
one of the marvels of evolution is that specializations of

217
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.308
the same canonical circuit can do vision, speech language

218
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.428
and cognition. And that's very important when you think

219
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.908
, how do we develop a sense of self cause

220
00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:52.969
our whole cortex shares a design and all the parts

221
00:16:53.058 --> 00:17:02.750
can seamlessly fit together into an emergent uh architecture that

222
00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:07.140
can be resonating uh as needed to do, you

223
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.890
know everything that we do in our conscious experience.

224
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.259
So I've always felt it was remarkable that some such

225
00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:22.199
seemingly different behavioral competences emerge out of variations of this

226
00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:27.680
ship canonical circuit. And no less remarkable is that

227
00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:34.989
circuit supports different kinds of conscious awareness. And because

228
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.098
all those circuits obey a similar kind of input output

229
00:17:41.108 --> 00:17:42.519
scheme, so they can all be interacted, feed

230
00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:48.439
forward feedback, et cetera that supports consciousness. Um

231
00:17:49.838 --> 00:17:55.400
But maybe that's all I should say about that you

232
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.348
have a lot of questions you want me to answer

233
00:17:56.689 --> 00:17:59.130
. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's

234
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.250
a lot there to unpack and it relates to also

235
00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:03.989
to some of the questions that I have also say

236
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.959
for listeners, I think, you know, think

237
00:18:08.969 --> 00:18:12.959
of this interview as listening to his story, everything

238
00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:15.699
in the story can be thought about and studied on

239
00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:18.640
multiple levels. But first get the gist of the

240
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.989
story and, and maybe as we go along,

241
00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:26.729
uh you'll ask me to flesh out things more but

242
00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:30.269
, but your questions really asked me to flesh things

243
00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:33.269
out more. So I, I think we should

244
00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:36.868
follow the questions and then see what made the needs

245
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.219
to be added. Of course. And so uh

246
00:18:40.229 --> 00:18:44.818
you've mentioned words like and computation there. And I

247
00:18:44.828 --> 00:18:48.199
would like to perhaps clarify that a little bit more

248
00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:52.789
. So, are our brains like computers? I

249
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:56.140
mean, when people talk about com brains as computers

250
00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.078
, when they use that metaphor, is it accurate

251
00:19:00.219 --> 00:19:04.489
or not? Well emphatically not. Um If I

252
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.949
start, I just noted we need new computational paradigms

253
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.489
. Uh like complementary computing, laminate computing. Uh

254
00:19:15.969 --> 00:19:22.500
Moreover, traditional computers aren't conscious. Um So my

255
00:19:22.509 --> 00:19:26.989
work provides or off as a scientific solution, the

256
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.459
mind body problem by showing how where in our brains

257
00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:37.118
and even why from a deep computational perspective, humans

258
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.459
can consciously see here, feel and know things about

259
00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:45.848
the world. And we don't just get conscious to

260
00:19:45.858 --> 00:19:52.309
serenely contemplate the beauty of the world rather we use

261
00:19:52.318 --> 00:19:56.328
our conscious states for reasons I hope will clarify as

262
00:19:56.338 --> 00:20:02.939
we go along because they are competent to uh um

263
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.358
control uh effective planning and action to realize valued goals

264
00:20:08.858 --> 00:20:14.709
. And so consciousness mediates between mind and the world

265
00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:18.618
of action. Um And so to do this,

266
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.789
our brains are self organizing, meaning we can learn

267
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:30.650
by ourselves autonomously throughout life. Their analog, which

268
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:36.430
means that the neurons can have values going from minimum

269
00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:40.189
to max and everything in between, not namely shades

270
00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:44.630
of gray, much as you might see an achromatic

271
00:20:44.709 --> 00:20:48.140
image in shades of gray and everything operates in parallel

272
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.689
because everything about our intelligence is organized in terms of

273
00:20:53.699 --> 00:21:00.549
spatially distributed patterns of activation. So self-organizing analog parallel

274
00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:06.439
, but present day computers are not self-organizing and they're

275
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:11.289
digital and serial. So the architectures are fundamentally different

276
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:18.380
. Um My own belief is that as uh computers

277
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.049
evolve and they are, you know, they get

278
00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:23.818
even more powerful, like, you know, my

279
00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:30.578
iphone is a supercomputer. Um We have systems that

280
00:21:30.588 --> 00:21:34.568
on the one hand, uh maybe dedicated VL SI

281
00:21:34.578 --> 00:21:37.910
chips that embody more and more of the kind of

282
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:45.459
intelligence that humans embody are complemented by a lot of

283
00:21:45.469 --> 00:21:48.640
things humans don't do well, which digital computers do

284
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.549
like adding a million numbers in a fraction of a

285
00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:56.299
second. And that will be a very powerful tool

286
00:21:56.309 --> 00:22:00.640
when when and if it happens. And uh you've

287
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:06.750
already mentioned their uh conscious awareness. How do we

288
00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:12.229
experience conscious moments of seeing, hearing, feeling,

289
00:22:12.239 --> 00:22:18.989
knowing and why do things like perception and awareness uh

290
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.858
matter here? Well, I wanna emphasize that although

291
00:22:26.368 --> 00:22:30.348
I've led the development of what I think is arguably

292
00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:34.689
the most advanced neural theory of consciousness in the sense

293
00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:40.180
that it provides principal and unifying explanations of the most

294
00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:47.380
psychological and or biological data about conscious experiences. I

295
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:52.479
never tried to directly understand consciousness. Uh You don't

296
00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:53.279
wake up in the morning and say, hey,

297
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:59.059
you know, let's understand consciousness today. Uh But

298
00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:03.578
instead all the deepest insights about how our brains work

299
00:23:04.309 --> 00:23:07.689
a concern. One of the things I just mentioned

300
00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:14.269
how they self organize uh through childhood development. And

301
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.259
do you have any kids? Uh No, not

302
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:18.318
yet. At least. Well, we have one

303
00:23:18.328 --> 00:23:22.670
daughter. Well, anyone who has observed little kids

304
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:29.180
learn language that's fast self organization and lifelong learning.

305
00:23:29.189 --> 00:23:33.959
We continue learning throughout life. Remarkably. Uh My

306
00:23:33.969 --> 00:23:38.380
models of learning led me forced me kicking and screaming

307
00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:48.368
into insights about consciousness. And uh so my work

308
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.699
on learning led to the most advanced, currently,

309
00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:56.880
the most advanced cognitive and neural the about how brains

310
00:23:56.239 --> 00:24:02.088
learn to pay attention, recognize and predict objects and

311
00:24:02.098 --> 00:24:06.750
events in a changing world emphatically. One that's filled

312
00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:10.699
with unexpected events because that's what we got to do

313
00:24:10.709 --> 00:24:15.160
to deal with evolutionary challenges. And this is the

314
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.309
theory I call adaptive resonance theory for a reason.

315
00:24:18.318 --> 00:24:21.680
I'll make clear in a moment and all of the

316
00:24:21.689 --> 00:24:26.439
foundational hypotheses have uh from which I could derive art

317
00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:33.729
have been supported by subsequent psychological and neurobiological data.

318
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:41.259
And art has also provided principled and unifying explanations of

319
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:45.949
many additional experiments. But for me, the bottom

320
00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:51.529
line is really that I was able to derive art

321
00:24:51.848 --> 00:24:55.189
. I say art A RT instead of adaptive Resonance

322
00:24:55.199 --> 00:25:00.650
theory in 1980 in an off cited article in the

323
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.640
journal Psychological Ro review from a thought experiment. And

324
00:25:04.868 --> 00:25:11.500
this thought experiment is about how any learning system can

325
00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:17.150
autonomously learn to correct predictive errors. So this is

326
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.380
all about autonomous learning and the hypotheses of the thought

327
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.759
experiment are just a few facts that are familiar to

328
00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:30.358
us all. And they're familiar because they represent ubiquitous

329
00:25:30.368 --> 00:25:34.680
environmental pressures on the evolution of our brain. So

330
00:25:34.689 --> 00:25:37.269
they're not something. Oh, well, why should

331
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:40.078
I believe that? You believe it because you've been

332
00:25:40.088 --> 00:25:42.130
living with it your whole life. And moreover,

333
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.289
during the thought experiment, I never used the word

334
00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:48.828
mind or brain. Mhm. So, the thought

335
00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:53.529
experiment and the principles and mechanisms that come out of

336
00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:57.969
the wash are thus the universal solution to the learning

337
00:25:57.979 --> 00:26:06.150
problem. Wherever those hypotheses are used to derive their

338
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.250
logical consequences, you'll get a system like art and

339
00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:15.209
the learning problem, which I didn't say one crucial

340
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:22.598
fact about lifelong learning implies that when I learn something

341
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.759
, I won't just forget it right away, which

342
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.390
is called catastrophic forgetting. For example, Ricardo,

343
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.880
I never uh saw your face before and now I'll

344
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.680
remember it for the rest of my life. So

345
00:26:36.689 --> 00:26:38.309
I learn it in a second. I'll remember it

346
00:26:38.318 --> 00:26:44.259
for years. So I call this the stability plasticity

347
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:48.160
dilemma. How any system can learn without catastrophe,

348
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:55.059
forgetting plasticity of because we experience incredibly fast learning often

349
00:26:55.588 --> 00:26:57.858
and then stability. The fact that our memory of

350
00:26:57.868 --> 00:27:02.709
that fast learning can persist for a very long time

351
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:04.670
. And let me just say, for those of

352
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.949
you who know some popular current A I like deep

353
00:27:08.959 --> 00:27:15.250
learning or it experiences catastrophic forgetting big time in multiple

354
00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:18.769
ways. Uh If we maybe we will talk about

355
00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:22.160
a little later. So I think therefore, it's

356
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:27.989
remarkable. But that these results about learning without catastrophic

357
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.078
forgetting is what led me to rigorous neural models of

358
00:27:33.088 --> 00:27:37.140
how we consciously see, hear and feel and know

359
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.709
things about the world. So I derive the models

360
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:48.209
I was explaining with simulation, parametric quantitative computer simulations

361
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.338
with my many students and postdoc all this quantitative data

362
00:27:55.068 --> 00:27:57.618
about seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing. And

363
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.209
then I realized all those parametric properties or properties of

364
00:28:02.219 --> 00:28:07.338
conscious experiences. So consciousness sort of came in through

365
00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:11.838
the back door. Uh And the thing that all

366
00:28:11.848 --> 00:28:19.729
of these experiences had in common are resonances which occur

367
00:28:19.739 --> 00:28:25.799
when there's excitatory feedback bottom up, top down excitatory

368
00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:32.368
feedback between pairs or greater numbers of brain regions when

369
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:37.410
they match their signals well enough to cause the active

370
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.299
cells to synchronize boom, boom, boom, boom

371
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.118
, boom, boom, boom, boom. Um

372
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:47.828
And that's one reason why we have brain rhythms,

373
00:28:47.838 --> 00:28:52.769
but different brain rhythms support different processes and sustain.

374
00:28:53.598 --> 00:29:00.539
They're firing long enough to trigger not only learning but

375
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:03.098
consciousness. In other words, the resonances and the

376
00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:10.318
requirement for matching or what dynamically buffer a learning process

377
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:15.390
against catastrophic forgetting. And the remarkable thing is that

378
00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:23.000
the contents of these resonances match properties of the conscious

379
00:29:23.009 --> 00:29:29.039
experiences that they're learning to represent. That's why I

380
00:29:29.049 --> 00:29:33.410
call my theory adaptive resonance theory because of how resonances

381
00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:40.449
trigger learning that doesn't experience catastrophic forgetting. So the

382
00:29:40.459 --> 00:29:44.838
proposed solution on mind body problem occurs due to a

383
00:29:44.848 --> 00:29:51.489
computational analysis of how humans and other animals autonomously learn

384
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:56.250
in a changing world without catastrophic forgetting. And because

385
00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:59.939
the hypotheses and the thought experiments that lead to cognitive

386
00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:03.338
models like adaptive resonance theory, as well as cognitive

387
00:30:03.348 --> 00:30:07.838
emotional models, like what I call my cog and

388
00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:11.199
model, the cognitive emotional motor model never mentioned the

389
00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:17.049
word mind and brain. Um My work and my

390
00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:22.328
book show how these models provide a blueprint for designing

391
00:30:22.338 --> 00:30:29.160
autonomous adaptive intelligent applications to engineering technology and A I

392
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.239
. So if you want autonomous adaptive intelligence, we

393
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.680
already have the foundations of a blueprint for it for

394
00:30:37.689 --> 00:30:45.170
the future. Um In particular, my books spend

395
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.098
a lot of time uh explaining how our brains consciously

396
00:30:48.108 --> 00:30:52.828
see the world. And that's not surprising because more

397
00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:59.059
than half of various mammalian brains are devoted to vision

398
00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:03.868
from excuse me, early sensory processing up to visually

399
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:11.160
based cognitive planning and navigation. Um In other words

400
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.140
, we need perception and consciousness to be able to

401
00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.920
act upon the world by looking, reaching and navigating

402
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:25.338
uh in order to survive environmental challenges. So this

403
00:31:25.348 --> 00:31:29.299
link between consciousness and action I think is very interesting

404
00:31:29.469 --> 00:31:33.759
mediated by learning that solves the stability plasticity dilemma.

405
00:31:36.618 --> 00:31:38.539
Sorry about this. I have had asthma for over

406
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:44.078
70 years. Uh So uh another thing that I

407
00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:45.390
would like to ask you about and it's something that

408
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.699
you also tackle in the book is Visual Illusion.

409
00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:53.449
So how do they work and what can we learn

410
00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:56.750
about? I guess not only the visual system but

411
00:31:56.818 --> 00:32:02.449
information processing by understanding how visual illusions work. Yeah

412
00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:06.130
, I wish we were able to figure out how

413
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.108
to show my powerpoint slides. I'll try to use

414
00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:14.088
the words uh about what the pictures would have shown

415
00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:17.588
more clearly. So first let me sketch why we

416
00:32:17.598 --> 00:32:22.680
experience visual illusions, which will also start to explain

417
00:32:22.689 --> 00:32:28.420
how they work. Um So let's start with the

418
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.969
retina, the photosensitive retina, that's where light is

419
00:32:31.979 --> 00:32:37.989
registered before light signals all over the retina are bundled

420
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:45.150
through axons as the pathways uh into the optic nerve

421
00:32:45.719 --> 00:32:50.959
to set pattern light from the whole retina up to

422
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:59.088
the brain because of the need to form the optic

423
00:32:59.098 --> 00:33:01.989
nerve to carry the light signals to the brain.

424
00:33:02.949 --> 00:33:08.608
The retina has no photo detectors on the part of

425
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:14.380
the retina where the optic nerve forms, that part

426
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:20.088
of the retina is blind. And um you might

427
00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:23.650
say, well, big deal, I don't see

428
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.068
it, it hasn't caused any trouble. But if

429
00:33:29.078 --> 00:33:31.239
you look down on the retina and I had a

430
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.630
pretty picture to show you that. And if you

431
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:38.019
get my book, um it has all these pictures

432
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:43.848
, it has over 600 color pictures. So everything

433
00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:47.969
I say is illustrated, another part of the retina

434
00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:52.640
not far from the blind spot is called the fovea

435
00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:57.348
Fove A. That's where all of our high acuity

436
00:33:57.358 --> 00:34:00.930
vision occurs. And it's because we need the phia

437
00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:07.078
to really see things clearly that we move our eyes

438
00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:12.000
several times every second with psychotic eye movements to point

439
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.610
them to the things we really wanna see clearly.

440
00:34:14.688 --> 00:34:20.188
Things in the periphery get fuzzier and fuzzier and the

441
00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.929
blind spot is as big as the phobia. And

442
00:34:23.938 --> 00:34:27.619
now you might say, but then why don't I

443
00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:31.099
see it? And um, before getting into,

444
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.648
why think about it, we couldn't look at or

445
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:39.407
reach for an object that happened to re registered where

446
00:34:39.418 --> 00:34:44.148
the blind spot is. If we didn't somehow do

447
00:34:44.157 --> 00:34:49.070
something to make that problem go away and that could

448
00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:52.360
lead to disaster, you know, a leopard is

449
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:55.019
leaping at you in the place where the blind spot

450
00:34:55.030 --> 00:35:00.030
would have seen it tough. So why aren't we

451
00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:02.760
aware of the missing visual signals due to the blind

452
00:35:02.769 --> 00:35:08.530
spot in particular, how do you complete the retina

453
00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:15.289
representation so that we can look at and reach for

454
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:22.349
things which otherwise might have been uh invisible. And

455
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.739
one thing you have to deal with right away is

456
00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:31.228
our eyes are rapidly jiggling in the orbit. They're

457
00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:36.090
sort of micro the cards and they're happening so fast

458
00:35:36.099 --> 00:35:37.000
and they're so small, you don't notice it,

459
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.349
but it's functionally very important because there may be a

460
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.599
stationary object in the world and you are stationary with

461
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.789
respect to it. But your retina is jiggling back

462
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.849
and forth around every edge of that object and it's

463
00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:02.039
creating transient signals. Um And these transient signals,

464
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:10.019
refresh visual signals um which otherwise would fade. I

465
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:15.320
like to mention Jurassic Park here. And did you

466
00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:16.909
see Jurassic Park? Yes, I do. You

467
00:36:16.918 --> 00:36:22.878
know that famous scene where um this guy is standing

468
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:28.719
out of the car and T Rex comes looking very

469
00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:32.409
ravenous and they scream, stand still. He can

470
00:36:32.418 --> 00:36:37.878
only see relative motion and then T Rex moves his

471
00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:43.320
head. Yes, relative motion and scoops them up

472
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:46.688
in one bite. Anyway, the blind spot is

473
00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:52.699
stabilized on the retina. So it doesn't create transients

474
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:59.708
and so it fades. So it's not gonna cause

475
00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:04.639
a problem in itself, but you still have uh

476
00:37:04.648 --> 00:37:07.719
an incomplete retina limit with a big hole in it

477
00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:12.530
. And so how do you complete that? And

478
00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:17.579
that is comp accomplished by multiple stages of completing boundaries

479
00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:23.539
across the hall and fill in with surface brightness and

480
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.728
color. And it takes several stages to do it

481
00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:37.070
. Um And I call processes whereby incomplete representations are

482
00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:44.398
completed by multiple stages of processing a hierarchical resolution of

483
00:37:44.409 --> 00:37:47.550
uncertainty because when you're done, you're going to get

484
00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:53.699
completed boundaries and completed surface representations. So you don't

485
00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:58.530
know there was a hole there. Mhm But then

486
00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:01.878
that raises a deep question. How does the brain

487
00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:08.628
know at what stage the cortical representation say of a

488
00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:16.938
surface representing your face is complete enough uh to um

489
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.648
control looking at you or maybe touching your nose?

490
00:38:22.659 --> 00:38:27.449
How do you know what stage? Because it took

491
00:38:27.458 --> 00:38:29.918
a lot of stages. And you don't want to

492
00:38:29.929 --> 00:38:34.800
use a stage that has an incomplete representation because then

493
00:38:34.809 --> 00:38:37.809
the leopard could leap at you through your blind spot

494
00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:40.800
. And the answer that I propose is that a

495
00:38:40.809 --> 00:38:47.688
resonance with a completed surface representation. And the next

496
00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:51.228
processing stage. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

497
00:38:52.188 --> 00:38:58.289
surface representation. Next stage lights up the surface representation

498
00:38:59.519 --> 00:39:02.949
makes it consciously visible. And then we use the

499
00:39:02.958 --> 00:39:10.398
conscious representation to look and reach. And so the

500
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:17.289
hierarchical resolution of uncertainty created the need to have some

501
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:23.360
active process light up the completed representation. And I

502
00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:31.000
call this a surface shroud resonance because spatial attention focusing

503
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:37.010
on the surface is called a intentional shroud. And

504
00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:42.500
I predict it occurs between a pre stride visual cortex

505
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.559
V four. In other words, there's a hierarchy

506
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.809
of cortical stages. It took several days stages to

507
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.750
complete the surface and the posterior parietal cortex which is

508
00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.389
known to support spatial attention. So V four P

509
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:05.369
PC I predict supports the surface route resonance and there's

510
00:40:05.378 --> 00:40:09.849
a lot of data supporting that. So getting back

511
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.570
to the original question, what's a visual illusion?

512
00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:21.648
If the boundaries that are completed do not contain expected

513
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.090
surface brightness and colors, then we say we're looking

514
00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:29.869
at a visual illusion. The truth is that almost

515
00:40:29.878 --> 00:40:32.898
everything we see is a visual illusion in the sense

516
00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:37.800
that we're completing boundaries and surfaces not only over the

517
00:40:37.809 --> 00:40:43.449
blind spot also over the plexus of retinal veins that

518
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:47.849
covers the photo detectors. In addition, where compensating

519
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.989
for variable illumination, we not seeing the illumination gradient

520
00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:59.889
. So the final representation of objects and scenes are

521
00:40:59.898 --> 00:41:02.389
visual illusions, but we only say, oh that's

522
00:41:02.398 --> 00:41:07.099
a visual illusion. If the color isn't what it

523
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.019
we think it should be based on our experience with

524
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:15.728
that kind of boundary. So everything basically in vision

525
00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:19.219
is an illusion and the ones that look funny,

526
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.769
we call illusions. OK? But about those ones

527
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.559
that look funny and we call illusions. How does

528
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:35.719
understanding how we experience those connect to our experience of

529
00:41:35.728 --> 00:41:37.978
art? Well, here, I would have shown

530
00:41:37.989 --> 00:41:43.329
you several pictures that would have been uh let people

531
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.728
listening. We weren't able to figure out how to

532
00:41:46.159 --> 00:41:51.360
link my powerpoint to the zoom. I've done it

533
00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:53.809
in the past, but I think the software changed

534
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:57.449
or something. I don't know. First, I

535
00:41:57.458 --> 00:42:00.300
want to say a little bit more about boundaries and

536
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:07.320
surfaces because they are the general functional units of how

537
00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:09.869
we see. That's an early prediction of mine that

538
00:42:09.878 --> 00:42:19.809
various people and supported psychophysics. So, um there's

539
00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:25.688
a wonderful uh illusion that it's painful to me not

540
00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:27.789
to be able to show it to you because it's

541
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.148
gonna be so hard to explain is a certain kind

542
00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:37.878
of Kinnier Square, Gaetano Kita famously introduced lots of

543
00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:44.610
visual illusions. He's very great uh Italian perceptual psychologist

544
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.898
who died some years ago in this illusion. He

545
00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:58.539
takes um circles and he'll make part of the circle

546
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:04.260
black and part of it light blue in a lot

547
00:43:04.269 --> 00:43:09.739
of concentric circles so that the black blue interface is

548
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:14.989
horizontal. But I'll make a Pacman out of it

549
00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:20.309
where the black part has a Pacman shape. These

550
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.668
are all black lines and then there's a little quarter

551
00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:25.579
of it, which is the blue parts which have

552
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:32.829
less contrast and he'll do four of them, 12

553
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:40.099
parallel to each other, like oriented three. It

554
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.889
is hard to do, but it's backwards. So

555
00:43:43.898 --> 00:43:47.489
we'll have pairs in a row and then pairs one

556
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.360
on top of the other. And so if you

557
00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:58.438
look at where the black and blue uh interfaces occur

558
00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:02.668
, they all line up to form an illusory square

559
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.909
and my book has it. I don't know if

560
00:44:06.918 --> 00:44:08.228
you can see it. Yes. Yes, I

561
00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:12.780
can. Yes. So you see the point is

562
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:21.989
that because of the bound, the strong black boundaries

563
00:44:22.668 --> 00:44:29.449
inhibiting the weak blue boundaries, that's enough to make

564
00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:32.949
the square form. And it's also enough to let

565
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:38.128
surface color pour out of the broken blue boundary to

566
00:44:38.139 --> 00:44:42.728
fill in the entire square. So what you see

567
00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:45.478
is a blue square, neither the blue nor the

568
00:44:45.489 --> 00:44:51.550
square are in the image. But what this illustrates

569
00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:54.878
and that's why it's such a lovely example. Boundaries

570
00:44:54.889 --> 00:45:01.168
are completed inwardly between pairs or greater numbers of inducers

571
00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:05.510
in an oriented way. That's how you complete the

572
00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:10.958
square and the blue color that spills out of the

573
00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:21.769
little blue uh broken boundaries spreads in a uh un

574
00:45:21.789 --> 00:45:29.719
oriented way um to fill in the square. So

575
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:37.030
um so the color spreads outwardly and un oriented and

576
00:45:37.039 --> 00:45:43.188
the boundaries are completed inwardly and oriented. And so

577
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:46.579
you could see from this outward, inward oriented,

578
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.619
un oriented, a sense of what I mean,

579
00:45:50.628 --> 00:45:53.228
that boundaries and surfaces are complementary and, and Yang

580
00:45:53.519 --> 00:45:58.050
, because you can't be both oriented and un oriented

581
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.539
and you can't be both outward and inward and without

582
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:05.579
both of them interacting though you don't see anything.

583
00:46:06.398 --> 00:46:10.820
And so you have these parallel cortical streams that are

584
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:19.438
doing complementary computing and then interacting to overcome their complementary

585
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:24.840
deficiencies. And there's one more big property of boundaries

586
00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:30.128
and surfaces. For starters, we can consciously see

587
00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:36.648
surface brightness and color we see while the, but

588
00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:44.340
we can't consciously see boundaries except when they separate surfaces

589
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:47.579
with different brightness and color boundaries are invisible. It's

590
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:54.070
called the offset grading. Uh Yes. OK.

591
00:46:54.079 --> 00:47:00.159
So all I've drawn is horizontal black lines, but

592
00:47:00.648 --> 00:47:07.550
usually you can recognize that there's a vertical boundary of

593
00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:12.688
some kind between the ends of those lines. Can

594
00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:17.469
you recognize that? So, but the boundary is

595
00:47:17.478 --> 00:47:24.260
invisible? OK. All boundaries are invisible. The

596
00:47:24.269 --> 00:47:30.438
only reason why you'll see color is because if you

597
00:47:30.449 --> 00:47:34.510
create uh let me see if you can see this

598
00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:37.250
. Whoops. Uh uh Yes, I can,

599
00:47:37.389 --> 00:47:40.478
I can. This is called the Ehrenstein disk.

600
00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:45.800
All I drew were black lines. It completed a

601
00:47:45.809 --> 00:47:50.938
roughly circular boundary, perpendicular lines. And then at

602
00:47:50.949 --> 00:47:54.340
the line ends, there were little black white contrasts

603
00:47:54.349 --> 00:48:00.728
that were little brightness buttons that filled in within the

604
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:04.599
boundary, the circular boundary and makes it look brighter

605
00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.719
. Do you see? It looks brighter? Yes

606
00:48:06.728 --> 00:48:09.168
, I see. OK. So that's a case

607
00:48:09.179 --> 00:48:15.840
where because the color can't escape, it makes for

608
00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:20.938
a visible brightness difference, but here the color can

609
00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:24.289
escape because it can flow all out of there and

610
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:30.929
spread uniformly on both sides of the vertical boundary.

611
00:48:30.938 --> 00:48:35.500
And so it's invisible. So I let me show

612
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.878
you, I think I wanna show you a very

613
00:48:37.889 --> 00:48:42.300
famous picture. That's a lot of fun. Let

614
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:47.550
me see. This is a famous picture uh perhaps

615
00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:51.019
just please move it a little bit away from the

616
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.329
camera because OK, like that like that, I

617
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.570
don't know if you can see, I can see

618
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.250
first, it looks just like splotches of black on

619
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.099
white. But if you look at it for a

620
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:08.148
while, you can see a Dalmatian dog in snow

621
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:15.708
. It's hard to do the image all the way

622
00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:21.869
to my right is the kita square. Mhm I

623
00:49:21.878 --> 00:49:23.039
don't know if you can see. Yes, I

624
00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:27.269
can see and right next to it horizontally, what's

625
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.139
called a reverse contrast kita square? Now the Kinnier

626
00:49:30.438 --> 00:49:37.329
square just like uh when I made that circle with

627
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.090
the lines, it looks brighter because the Pac Man

628
00:49:42.099 --> 00:49:46.099
, the four pac men create square boundaries and then

629
00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:52.309
they put bright contrast inside which fill in the square

630
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.208
and look brighter. But if you look at the

631
00:49:54.219 --> 00:50:00.989
one right next to it, it has two black

632
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.159
and two white inducers on gray background. And there

633
00:50:08.168 --> 00:50:14.369
you can recognize that there is a square but the

634
00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:17.099
gray inside and outside of the square is the same

635
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:23.478
. So it's visible. So in the case of

636
00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:27.969
the reverse contrast, Ken it a square, I'm

637
00:50:27.978 --> 00:50:30.050
so sorry, I should have just made. No

638
00:50:30.059 --> 00:50:30.869
, no, no worries. I can edit this

639
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.750
. Yeah. So you can consciously recognize a a

640
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:44.869
square boundary that you don't see. Um Anyway,

641
00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:53.369
many artists knew uh instinctively about these things, including

642
00:50:53.378 --> 00:51:00.438
matisse who I love and matisse used to like writing

643
00:51:01.148 --> 00:51:05.570
that all bound. Well, he didn't write all

644
00:51:05.579 --> 00:51:10.168
boundaries are invisible, but he painted with color blotches

645
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:21.909
and knowing that the boundaries would be completed to create

646
00:51:21.918 --> 00:51:24.958
a scene. And one of my favorites is the

647
00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:29.119
self care and I leave it, leave it like

648
00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:31.250
that, please. Yeah. Yeah. He painted

649
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:38.809
that in uh 1905. And if you see it

650
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:42.478
uh in my book or on the web or wherever

651
00:51:42.969 --> 00:51:45.760
you'll see that there are a lot of color splotches

652
00:51:45.148 --> 00:51:50.500
, but they're arranged in a way that invisible boundaries

653
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:58.159
join them and create surface representations of objects. So

654
00:51:58.168 --> 00:52:00.969
let me see if I can, they get the

655
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:02.668
schematic of that. Yes, I can see it

656
00:52:02.679 --> 00:52:07.849
now. Yeah, you see the splotches create a

657
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:15.260
modal boundary groupings which then capture the splotches into surface

658
00:52:15.269 --> 00:52:22.929
color. So, OK, anyway, so um

659
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:31.728
that is one link between art and um illusions.

660
00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:37.409
And I discussed the work of 14 different artists showing

661
00:52:37.418 --> 00:52:40.958
how they all instinctively exploited different properties of how we

662
00:52:40.969 --> 00:52:45.010
see. I mean, just consider like uh the

663
00:52:45.019 --> 00:52:52.849
impressionists like Monet and Point Allistic painting sera. Um

664
00:52:52.739 --> 00:53:00.110
you know how these little points of color arranged uh

665
00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:04.929
in an appropriate way, generated emergent boundaries and surfaces

666
00:53:05.389 --> 00:53:10.610
that you can interpret as a beautiful scene. So

667
00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:15.000
uh my book spends a lot of time showing how

668
00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:23.449
different artists and artistic movements um uh generated uh painterly

669
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:30.320
precepts that we understand often as scenes and objects even

670
00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:34.458
, you know, and like how you get effects

671
00:53:34.469 --> 00:53:37.809
of three dimensional curvature in a two D painting.

672
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:43.070
And one of the big things my book explains is

673
00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:47.530
how the way our visual system adapted to the three

674
00:53:47.539 --> 00:53:54.280
dimensional world, those same laws automatically enable us to

675
00:53:54.289 --> 00:54:06.869
understand paintings. Um zoom screen movies as 3d objects

676
00:54:07.168 --> 00:54:07.679
. You know, I'm not seeing you like a

677
00:54:07.688 --> 00:54:12.409
pancake, I'm seeing a frontal view of a three

678
00:54:12.418 --> 00:54:15.570
dimensional face. And so we've been talking here a

679
00:54:15.579 --> 00:54:17.789
lot about the visual system, but how do we

680
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:24.280
go from seeing to recognizing and also then to predicting

681
00:54:24.289 --> 00:54:31.599
the world? Um So first let's distinguish, seeing

682
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:37.539
and recognizing. So seeing, we open our eyes

683
00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.208
and if there's enough light we'll see, it could

684
00:54:39.219 --> 00:54:44.500
be unfamiliar or familiar. Uh So seeing is a

685
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:50.000
general purpose process, but we only recognize familiar things

686
00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:57.059
. So recognition requires prior learning of recognition categories for

687
00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:00.820
objects and scenes. Uh so that these categories would

688
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:07.360
selectively fire after learning in response to the objects and

689
00:55:07.369 --> 00:55:10.688
scenes that we've experienced before. And that raises the

690
00:55:10.699 --> 00:55:14.369
question, how do you learn a recognition category?

691
00:55:14.378 --> 00:55:19.619
And I already noted that Adaptive Resonance Theory or art

692
00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:24.659
explains how we learn to recognize stuff without experiencing catastrophic

693
00:55:24.668 --> 00:55:29.898
forgetting. And one thing I didn't say about learning

694
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:32.958
in what I said, it enables us to pay

695
00:55:32.969 --> 00:55:37.728
attention. But what it's what we're learning as we're

696
00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:45.119
learning categories that can be used for prediction is what

697
00:55:45.128 --> 00:55:52.139
are the critical feature combinations that are going to predict

698
00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:57.458
uh successful action? How do we suppress the irrelevant

699
00:55:57.469 --> 00:56:01.159
outliers? And when you study adaptive residency, you

700
00:56:01.168 --> 00:56:07.869
see how over learning trials outlier, irrelevant features get

701
00:56:07.878 --> 00:56:13.329
actively suppressed and you gradually converge it can be very

702
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.869
fast. It depends on the complexity of the problem

703
00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:23.878
on a set of critical features in the activation pattern

704
00:56:23.889 --> 00:56:29.228
. Uh that you know, the top down expectation

705
00:56:29.239 --> 00:56:32.059
is lighting up and it's so critical features that go

706
00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:37.340
into the bottom up adaptive filters that choose the category

707
00:56:37.458 --> 00:56:43.599
and in the top down expectation that the category reads

708
00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:50.280
out to focus attention. And so the critical features

709
00:56:50.378 --> 00:56:54.780
enable art categories to be associated with predictive consequences.

710
00:56:57.148 --> 00:57:05.199
Um Yeah. So and so and different resonances then

711
00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:09.699
support seeing and recognizing I mentioned mhm A surface shroud

712
00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:16.820
resonance supports conscious seeing and uh the shroud is in

713
00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:23.340
posterior parietal cortex. Um the surfaces in V four

714
00:57:23.628 --> 00:57:28.750
, when that resonance occurs, it propagates top down

715
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.728
all the way down to uh lateral chani it all

716
00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:36.878
the way up to prefrontal cortex. And because of

717
00:57:36.889 --> 00:57:38.668
what's called the art matching room, namely how we

718
00:57:38.679 --> 00:57:44.898
pay attention. It selects the critical features that uh

719
00:57:44.909 --> 00:57:47.909
we should be looking at. But then the feature

720
00:57:47.918 --> 00:57:53.599
category resonance um which goes into the watch stream,

721
00:57:54.530 --> 00:58:00.489
recognition and perception stream that supports conscious knowing. So

722
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:06.860
that when a surface shroud resonance and a feature category

723
00:58:06.869 --> 00:58:12.228
resonance synchronize, when I look at a familiar person's

724
00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:15.610
face, I both see them and know who they

725
00:58:15.619 --> 00:58:20.148
are. Um And I had a nice, nice

726
00:58:20.159 --> 00:58:23.099
picture of that. But if, if you're interested

727
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:27.110
anyway about my book, if you are interested,

728
00:58:27.119 --> 00:58:29.519
I I should say this because, you know,

729
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.590
you might think such a big book. Uh If

730
00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:35.340
you buy it on Kindle, it's 15 bucks.

731
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:37.679
And if you buy it from Amazon, it's about

732
00:58:37.688 --> 00:58:42.989
30 it would have cost over 100. But I

733
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.869
worked very hard on the book and I want the

734
00:58:45.878 --> 00:58:49.208
people who are interested to be able to afford it

735
00:58:49.219 --> 00:58:53.719
. So I I asked Oxford University Press how much

736
00:58:53.728 --> 00:58:57.119
of my own money I had to give them to

737
00:58:57.128 --> 00:59:00.398
bring the prices down. So if you get it

738
00:59:00.409 --> 00:59:04.320
, it's cheap because I subsidized it. Well,

739
00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:07.478
thank you so much for that. That's very generous

740
00:59:07.489 --> 00:59:08.128
. I guess that people will be. How much

741
00:59:08.199 --> 00:59:12.489
did it cost in Portugal? Yeah, I don't

742
00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.929
know why the, the you, you use euros

743
00:59:15.938 --> 00:59:17.579
in Portugal. Uh, y yes, I,

744
00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:21.789
I mean, I, I think it cost around

745
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.570
, uh, I don't know,€30 I guess

746
00:59:23.579 --> 00:59:29.260
I um order it from Amazon Spain. So,

747
00:59:29.989 --> 00:59:31.949
yeah, so that's not that different from$30.

748
00:59:32.679 --> 00:59:35.579
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's

749
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.909
right. Well, thank you for buying it.

750
00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.610
So um should we, should we move on?

751
00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:43.250
Uh Yes. Uh And I was going to ask

752
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:46.110
you now, uh actually earlier, you've mentioned for

753
00:59:46.119 --> 00:59:52.300
example, your uh cognition, emotion motor model.

754
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:57.199
But how do you look at the relationship between emotion

755
00:59:57.340 --> 00:60:00.280
and cognition and brave cognition about is what we know

756
00:60:00.289 --> 00:60:07.000
about the world and emotion embodies, how we feel

757
00:60:07.010 --> 00:60:09.929
about what we know. And it's emotion that gives

758
00:60:09.938 --> 00:60:16.099
value to what we know. And here another resonance

759
00:60:16.110 --> 00:60:27.179
occurs between our cognitive alike representations and our emotional representations

760
00:60:27.610 --> 00:60:30.878
. So the alike ones are in places like infra

761
00:60:30.938 --> 00:60:34.739
temporal and prefrontal cortex. The emotional ones are in

762
00:60:34.750 --> 00:60:40.500
places like the Amygdala and hypothalamus. And when there's

763
00:60:40.510 --> 00:60:49.599
a resonance between cognitive and emotional uh representations that combines

764
00:60:49.610 --> 00:60:52.760
what we know with how we feel about it.

765
00:60:52.010 --> 00:60:59.349
And the feedback from the emotional representation is called incentive

766
00:60:59.360 --> 00:61:05.849
motivation. Not only to pay sustained attention to something

767
00:61:05.860 --> 00:61:08.918
that we currently value, but it also gives the

768
00:61:08.929 --> 00:61:15.679
motivation to release actions to realize goals about things we

769
00:61:15.688 --> 00:61:19.929
value. So, you know, if I see

770
00:61:20.820 --> 00:61:24.878
my wife's face a little way from here, I'll

771
00:61:24.889 --> 00:61:29.128
feel all the good things I feel to her and

772
00:61:29.139 --> 00:61:34.378
the motivation to approach her. So a cognitive emotional

773
00:61:34.389 --> 00:61:43.119
resonance sends positive feedback between the cognitive and emotional representations

774
00:61:44.500 --> 00:61:46.918
. So just as a current object or event can

775
00:61:46.929 --> 00:61:52.619
trigger an emotion, an active emotion can select and

776
00:61:52.628 --> 00:61:58.938
focus attention on objects and events that are compatible with

777
00:61:58.949 --> 00:62:01.539
that emotion. And that can help us achieve,

778
00:62:02.199 --> 00:62:07.688
you know, um results that are compatible with it

779
00:62:07.878 --> 00:62:13.219
where emotion could be hunger and we just wanna go

780
00:62:13.739 --> 00:62:21.139
have lunch. So um how to notice desire attend

781
00:62:21.599 --> 00:62:24.769
and eat that ice cream cone. It's all wrapped

782
00:62:24.800 --> 00:62:30.898
up into cognitive emotional resonances in their output pathways.

783
00:62:30.840 --> 00:62:37.179
Um So the cognitive emotional resonance is a different kind

784
00:62:37.188 --> 00:62:44.250
of consciousness because it links, for example, um

785
00:62:45.418 --> 00:62:47.938
to surface shroud resonance. Well, I think we're

786
00:62:47.949 --> 00:62:52.320
gonna talk about that in a moment. So,

787
00:62:52.329 --> 00:62:55.699
so I I mean, these different kinds of awareness

788
00:62:55.708 --> 00:62:59.898
that we have and we've talked about some of them

789
00:63:00.219 --> 00:63:04.360
, how, how are they then integrated into what

790
00:63:04.369 --> 00:63:09.199
we experience as unified moments of conscious awareness? Yeah

791
00:63:09.208 --> 00:63:15.458
. So for that multiple adaptive resonance is synchronized.

792
00:63:15.869 --> 00:63:19.708
I mentioned two of them that could. But so

793
00:63:19.719 --> 00:63:23.168
example, during a conversation with a friend, we

794
00:63:23.179 --> 00:63:29.978
might be synchronizing surface shroud residents to consciously see them

795
00:63:30.500 --> 00:63:37.260
stream shroud resonances that consciously hear them feature category resonances

796
00:63:37.269 --> 00:63:44.929
to consciously recognize what we're hearing. Cognitive emotional resonance

797
00:63:44.938 --> 00:63:50.079
is to consciously have feelings about what we're discussing and

798
00:63:50.090 --> 00:63:54.489
then what's called item list resonances to consciously understand the

799
00:63:54.500 --> 00:64:01.228
conversation because they're supporting things like working memory of sequential

800
00:64:01.239 --> 00:64:08.619
sounds that form language phrases and sentences, and all

801
00:64:08.628 --> 00:64:13.458
of them come together to enable us to act appropriately

802
00:64:13.469 --> 00:64:15.478
during the conversation. So it's not just a single

803
00:64:15.489 --> 00:64:20.449
resonance, there's a continually evolving series of resident states

804
00:64:20.628 --> 00:64:26.918
as stuff keeps happening. And so uh we've already

805
00:64:26.929 --> 00:64:30.039
talked here about the relationship between cognition and emotion.

806
00:64:30.050 --> 00:64:32.099
Uh I would like to ask you now specifically about

807
00:64:32.110 --> 00:64:35.849
the prefrontal cortex. So, in all of what

808
00:64:35.860 --> 00:64:40.300
we've been talking about here, does the prefrontal cortex

809
00:64:40.309 --> 00:64:46.860
play a special role? Um Well, I'm gonna

810
00:64:46.869 --> 00:64:49.378
want to show you a figure of that for sure

811
00:64:49.389 --> 00:64:53.469
. But, but first, let me say it

812
00:64:53.478 --> 00:64:59.280
carries out or controls many of the higher cognitive,

813
00:64:59.289 --> 00:65:04.840
emotional and decision making processes that define human intelligence as

814
00:65:04.849 --> 00:65:10.079
it's also controlling release of actions uh and aimed at

815
00:65:10.090 --> 00:65:13.699
achieving value gold. And as I just mentioned,

816
00:65:14.208 --> 00:65:17.829
one of the things prefrontal cortex has it has um

817
00:65:17.969 --> 00:65:28.500
working memories that can uh generate uh what I call

818
00:65:28.510 --> 00:65:33.000
um list chunks or list categories like words, sentences

819
00:65:33.010 --> 00:65:40.938
, phrases, thoughts that can sequentially determine what's appropriate

820
00:65:40.949 --> 00:65:44.019
to do in a given situation. So it's not

821
00:65:44.030 --> 00:65:48.159
just one thing and it enabled us to generate behaviors

822
00:65:48.168 --> 00:65:55.418
that are flexible and adaptive notably in novel situations and

823
00:65:55.429 --> 00:65:59.978
to suppress ones that aren't by using this contextual knowledge

824
00:66:00.878 --> 00:66:04.269
. Um Can you see the seven regions on top

825
00:66:04.280 --> 00:66:10.378
in red and green? Uh uh Yeah, I

826
00:66:10.389 --> 00:66:13.340
, I mean the green, it's not perceptible here

827
00:66:13.349 --> 00:66:15.599
. But yeah, I see the, the several

828
00:66:16.110 --> 00:66:20.958
regions on top, they're all different regions of prefrontal

829
00:66:20.969 --> 00:66:28.139
cortex. And basically, when you put together all

830
00:66:28.148 --> 00:66:34.929
the models into this larger neural architecture, it explains

831
00:66:34.938 --> 00:66:44.398
how the prefrontal cortex interacts with uh cognitive emotional decision

832
00:66:44.409 --> 00:66:50.829
making processes to make contextually based decisions about what to

833
00:66:50.840 --> 00:66:55.909
do or think next. So it's uh so you

834
00:66:55.918 --> 00:66:59.918
got to understand how working memories work and a whole

835
00:66:59.929 --> 00:67:04.059
series of things we won't discuss much today. So

836
00:67:04.070 --> 00:67:08.809
earlier, you've mentioned learning and I want to ask

837
00:67:08.820 --> 00:67:11.579
you a little bit more about it because actually in

838
00:67:11.590 --> 00:67:14.860
the book, you also explain why we need to

839
00:67:14.869 --> 00:67:17.688
understand learning to then properly understand consciousness. And you

840
00:67:17.699 --> 00:67:23.659
distinguish between two different types of learning, perceiving and

841
00:67:23.668 --> 00:67:28.978
knowing versus moving and navigating. How do they differ

842
00:67:28.989 --> 00:67:33.250
from one another? Right. Well, so I

843
00:67:33.260 --> 00:67:40.438
briefly mentioned before that perception and cognition are represented in

844
00:67:40.449 --> 00:67:46.168
the w or ventral uh cortical stream and then a

845
00:67:46.188 --> 00:67:55.139
spatial organization in action including navigation of representing the where

846
00:67:55.289 --> 00:68:03.208
or dorsal cortical stream. And um uh they obey

847
00:68:03.219 --> 00:68:10.769
computationally complementary laws. I'm gonna just say in words

848
00:68:10.780 --> 00:68:13.478
what they are. And then it may be that

849
00:68:13.489 --> 00:68:18.048
one of the sly, one of the um copies

850
00:68:18.060 --> 00:68:20.909
I was trying to make in my powerpoint was of

851
00:68:20.918 --> 00:68:23.509
that. And I can actually show it. I'll

852
00:68:23.520 --> 00:68:27.009
run that to my other study. So perception and

853
00:68:27.020 --> 00:68:31.720
cognition, use exci toy matching and match based learning

854
00:68:32.029 --> 00:68:33.699
. What does that mean? So if I read

855
00:68:33.708 --> 00:68:41.140
out a top down expectation, um a prime the

856
00:68:41.149 --> 00:68:45.779
system for getting ready to respond more vigorously to an

857
00:68:45.789 --> 00:68:49.579
expected event, oh, you're here, I recognize

858
00:68:49.588 --> 00:68:55.369
your face faster. So that's excitatory matching and match

859
00:68:55.458 --> 00:68:59.939
based learning means that you only go into adaptive resonance

860
00:69:00.529 --> 00:69:04.619
if what you're expecting and what you're learning about uh

861
00:69:04.628 --> 00:69:11.100
c close enough together. So you can suppress stuff

862
00:69:11.109 --> 00:69:14.470
and learn a better and better critical feature pattern.

863
00:69:15.009 --> 00:69:17.779
So the learning is ex excited to it's match based

864
00:69:17.789 --> 00:69:21.239
and the matching is side to it. But navigation

865
00:69:21.250 --> 00:69:27.489
and action use inhibitory matching and mismatch based learning.

866
00:69:27.798 --> 00:69:30.707
What is an inhibitory match, let's say within our

867
00:69:30.719 --> 00:69:35.389
movement, I have a representation of where my hand

868
00:69:35.398 --> 00:69:41.469
is now and I wanted to go here. So

869
00:69:41.479 --> 00:69:43.908
this is my present position. This is my target

870
00:69:43.917 --> 00:69:46.609
position. Then I have a volitional go signal from

871
00:69:46.619 --> 00:69:51.060
the basal ganglia that makes my arm move from here

872
00:69:51.069 --> 00:69:55.220
to here. But when I get here, I

873
00:69:55.229 --> 00:70:01.779
am where I wanna be. So that present target

874
00:70:01.789 --> 00:70:08.958
minus present is zero, that's inhibitory matching. And

875
00:70:08.970 --> 00:70:13.548
it turns out you use that mismatch in an appropriate

876
00:70:13.560 --> 00:70:16.720
way to tune the circuit so that when you are

877
00:70:16.729 --> 00:70:21.020
, where you wanna be the difference vector is zero

878
00:70:21.029 --> 00:70:26.649
. So first here, I can't see what I'm

879
00:70:26.659 --> 00:70:30.739
showing you I can see it, here's a slide

880
00:70:30.750 --> 00:70:35.029
of adaptive resonance and you can see the light green

881
00:70:35.039 --> 00:70:40.159
down here. Yes, that's the critical feature pattern

882
00:70:41.140 --> 00:70:45.039
so that you have a top down match on the

883
00:70:45.048 --> 00:70:47.659
critical feature pattern. You go through an excitatory resonance

884
00:70:48.250 --> 00:70:55.390
to try to learn that. And the way that

885
00:70:55.399 --> 00:71:00.119
works if we're gonna discuss it is via the art

886
00:71:00.128 --> 00:71:02.668
matching rule. Uh move it just a little bit

887
00:71:02.680 --> 00:71:05.989
to your left, please. Yes, like that

888
00:71:06.140 --> 00:71:10.378
. Yes. So the what the art matching rule

889
00:71:10.390 --> 00:71:13.890
shows, you see, there's, if I have

890
00:71:13.899 --> 00:71:18.069
bottom up excited Tory input, it can fire a

891
00:71:18.079 --> 00:71:23.079
feature selective cells. If nothing else is happening,

892
00:71:24.159 --> 00:71:28.289
if I activate a category and I try to read

893
00:71:28.298 --> 00:71:33.810
out in those spreading green adapted pathways, uh AAA

894
00:71:33.819 --> 00:71:40.399
critical feature pattern or prototype, I can't fully do

895
00:71:40.409 --> 00:71:46.338
it because I'm also activating this inhibitory of surround which

896
00:71:46.350 --> 00:71:53.418
approximately balances the excitatory on center. That's how I

897
00:71:53.430 --> 00:71:57.069
prime. When I read out that, that expectation

898
00:71:57.289 --> 00:72:00.220
, there might be some subthreshold activation of the cells

899
00:72:00.229 --> 00:72:04.520
that got activated and a deep trough of inhibition around

900
00:72:04.529 --> 00:72:08.060
it. But then if I have a matching bottom

901
00:72:08.069 --> 00:72:12.310
up input, it's two against one, too excited

902
00:72:12.319 --> 00:72:15.279
to one bottom up, one top down one inhibitory

903
00:72:15.439 --> 00:72:17.680
, you can start to fire and that can lead

904
00:72:17.689 --> 00:72:23.918
to resonance. And I don't know if we discuss

905
00:72:23.930 --> 00:72:26.708
, we're gonna discuss that. Uh What do you

906
00:72:26.720 --> 00:72:30.779
do if something unexpected happens? There's a complimentary attentional

907
00:72:30.789 --> 00:72:34.798
system and orienting system where the learning goes on the

908
00:72:34.810 --> 00:72:38.640
attentional system. And if you get a big enough

909
00:72:38.649 --> 00:72:44.109
mismatch or novelty or unexpectedness, it activates the oriented

910
00:72:44.119 --> 00:72:49.798
system which automatically discovers a better matching category or a

911
00:72:49.819 --> 00:72:53.409
new category to learn the new stuff. So,

912
00:72:54.298 --> 00:72:58.668
OK, that was a little a field. So

913
00:72:58.949 --> 00:73:00.569
sorry, let's get back to your question. Uh

914
00:73:00.579 --> 00:73:04.579
So then, I mean, why is it,

915
00:73:04.588 --> 00:73:10.659
why do we need to understand learning then to properly

916
00:73:10.668 --> 00:73:15.779
understand consciousness? Well, to summarize my work shows

917
00:73:15.500 --> 00:73:21.970
that learning without catastrophic forgetting is solved by adaptive resonances

918
00:73:23.750 --> 00:73:28.699
. And that properties of the adaptive resonances just after

919
00:73:28.708 --> 00:73:33.329
years of modeling happen to support multiple conscious states with

920
00:73:33.338 --> 00:73:36.439
different functions in different parts of the brain. We

921
00:73:36.470 --> 00:73:41.390
reviewed some of them, all of them are supported

922
00:73:41.588 --> 00:73:46.798
by lots of explanations of modeling simulations and explanations of

923
00:73:46.810 --> 00:73:53.140
data. So, um you know, science is

924
00:73:53.149 --> 00:74:00.060
never complete but um uh I'm I'm sort of baffled

925
00:74:00.069 --> 00:74:01.970
in a way, you know, we live in

926
00:74:01.979 --> 00:74:06.579
the world of Google, you can presumably search for

927
00:74:06.588 --> 00:74:15.430
anything in no time at all. And yet I've

928
00:74:15.439 --> 00:74:20.439
explained data from hundreds of experiments. Never mentioning the

929
00:74:20.449 --> 00:74:28.060
word quantum no quantum. Um There were quantum effects

930
00:74:28.069 --> 00:74:32.619
at the photoreceptors at the when you know noise hits

931
00:74:32.628 --> 00:74:38.759
the the ear at the periphery right away, our

932
00:74:38.770 --> 00:74:44.689
brains are designed to suppress quantum noise and to deal

933
00:74:44.699 --> 00:74:49.458
with it to become deterministic. And yet today,

934
00:74:49.470 --> 00:74:54.140
there are still people who are promoting that, you

935
00:74:54.149 --> 00:74:57.949
know, consciousness must be quantum because they don't understand

936
00:74:57.958 --> 00:75:02.128
it and must be in microtubules. So how do

937
00:75:02.140 --> 00:75:06.338
you recite Keats out of a microtubule? That's beyond

938
00:75:06.350 --> 00:75:13.949
my understanding. So there's overwhelming evidence that what I'm

939
00:75:13.958 --> 00:75:16.909
saying is at least on the road to the truth

940
00:75:17.479 --> 00:75:24.569
and the thought experiments cannot be denied because the hypotheses

941
00:75:24.750 --> 00:75:30.430
are familiar facts. Um When I grew up learning

942
00:75:30.439 --> 00:75:35.418
science, I thought you studied the theories that explain

943
00:75:35.430 --> 00:75:41.770
the most data in a principled way and nothing comes

944
00:75:41.779 --> 00:75:45.668
close. So I hope some people are interested in

945
00:75:45.680 --> 00:75:48.989
studying it. And I wrote my book in particular

946
00:75:49.000 --> 00:75:55.708
to be self-contained and non technical. But that being

947
00:75:55.720 --> 00:75:58.399
said, we are talking about the human mind,

948
00:75:58.979 --> 00:76:03.128
which is perhaps the most complex system in nature that

949
00:76:03.140 --> 00:76:09.520
we can hope to understand scientifically. So uh it

950
00:76:09.529 --> 00:76:14.628
requires thoughtful reading. I have friends who've read it

951
00:76:15.509 --> 00:76:17.369
uh parts of it, you know, who know

952
00:76:17.378 --> 00:76:21.409
no science at all. Um a rabbi, a

953
00:76:21.418 --> 00:76:27.298
pastor, a, a visual artist, a gallery

954
00:76:27.310 --> 00:76:31.338
owner, a lawyer, the social worker. Um

955
00:76:31.350 --> 00:76:33.779
and they would read the parts that interest them and

956
00:76:34.378 --> 00:76:38.229
, and that's possible because I wrote the chapter.

957
00:76:38.239 --> 00:76:43.039
So after you read the preface and introductory chapter,

958
00:76:43.048 --> 00:76:46.798
one, each chapter can be read independently of the

959
00:76:46.810 --> 00:76:49.699
others. So you don't have to try to read

960
00:76:49.708 --> 00:76:54.029
the whole thing who has that much time or interest

961
00:76:54.750 --> 00:76:57.128
. But you know, if you're interested in about

962
00:76:57.759 --> 00:77:01.259
feelings, you can jump to the chapter about feelings

963
00:77:01.750 --> 00:77:06.509
and so on. So let me ask you now

964
00:77:06.520 --> 00:77:10.850
a little bit about the evolution of the brain.

965
00:77:10.859 --> 00:77:14.759
And actually earlier, you've already touched a little bit

966
00:77:14.770 --> 00:77:17.619
on the idea or the proposal that some people have

967
00:77:17.628 --> 00:77:21.579
of modularity. But what do you think about that

968
00:77:21.588 --> 00:77:26.569
idea more specifically about the idea of modularity of the

969
00:77:26.579 --> 00:77:33.548
brain slash mind? Well, brain anatomy is definitely

970
00:77:33.560 --> 00:77:41.119
specialized. There are multiple brain regions that carry out

971
00:77:41.128 --> 00:77:45.859
different functions like vision, audition, cognition, emotion

972
00:77:45.869 --> 00:77:48.779
, and so on. But the processes aren't carried

973
00:77:48.789 --> 00:77:53.739
out by independent modules. In fact, if you

974
00:77:53.750 --> 00:77:59.739
look at f the famous Feldman and Van Essen macro

975
00:77:59.750 --> 00:78:04.119
circuit, which I had a picture of um they

976
00:78:04.128 --> 00:78:11.298
all interact. Um I can't, you see,

977
00:78:11.310 --> 00:78:13.399
I can't see it when, when you can see

978
00:78:13.409 --> 00:78:15.168
it. Yes, but I can see it.

979
00:78:15.180 --> 00:78:17.729
Yes. OK. So on the one hand in

980
00:78:17.739 --> 00:78:25.649
the lower right, that's the anatomical diagram by Feldman

981
00:78:25.659 --> 00:78:30.029
and Van Een of the interactions in the visual system

982
00:78:30.770 --> 00:78:35.588
dense bottom up, top down multiple stages. Remember

983
00:78:35.810 --> 00:78:41.949
, hierarchical processing of uncertainty and the bigger picture if

984
00:78:41.958 --> 00:78:46.439
you could read it gives the functions carried out by

985
00:78:46.449 --> 00:78:50.520
different parts of visual cortex along with what region it

986
00:78:50.529 --> 00:78:54.208
is. And there are bottom up, top down

987
00:78:54.220 --> 00:79:00.159
horizontal interactions and and as the figure says, the

988
00:79:00.168 --> 00:79:05.989
bottom up horizontal and top down interactions overcome complementary processing

989
00:79:06.000 --> 00:79:13.229
deficiencies. So if it weren't for them, those

990
00:79:13.239 --> 00:79:18.409
interactions nothing could be completed effectively. And moreover,

991
00:79:18.418 --> 00:79:25.369
each of the processes do what one's called multiplexing information

992
00:79:25.810 --> 00:79:29.579
. So a visual boundary, it's not just an

993
00:79:29.588 --> 00:79:33.128
edge. If you know, I the the famous

994
00:79:33.140 --> 00:79:36.668
example of a shaded ellipse, if all it was

995
00:79:36.680 --> 00:79:42.729
was a bounding edge at the instead of a boundary

996
00:79:43.409 --> 00:79:45.829
, then the color inside would just fill in and

997
00:79:45.838 --> 00:79:49.789
you'd see a flat gray ellipse, but boundaries respond

998
00:79:49.798 --> 00:79:56.739
to edges, texture shading and depth. And so

999
00:79:57.208 --> 00:80:01.449
, um in addition to hierarchical resolution of uncertainty with

1000
00:80:01.458 --> 00:80:05.838
all these interactions, each of the computations are multiplexing

1001
00:80:05.850 --> 00:80:11.560
, multiple properties. And as I said before,

1002
00:80:11.569 --> 00:80:14.859
otherwise, you couldn't, I couldn't ever learn to

1003
00:80:14.869 --> 00:80:16.829
recognize your face. You know, you have texture

1004
00:80:16.838 --> 00:80:20.479
, you have shading, you have boundaries. Um

1005
00:80:21.270 --> 00:80:25.289
It's all overlaid. I have to be able to

1006
00:80:25.298 --> 00:80:30.020
deal with it holistically. Did that help? No

1007
00:80:30.029 --> 00:80:33.579
. Yes, that helped. And uh earlier or

1008
00:80:33.588 --> 00:80:36.949
just a minute ago, actually, you mentioned how

1009
00:80:36.970 --> 00:80:41.668
uh many theories of consciousness out there, people,

1010
00:80:41.680 --> 00:80:45.159
apparently people who propose them apparently do not even look

1011
00:80:45.168 --> 00:80:48.430
at uh scientific data. So, but why do

1012
00:80:48.439 --> 00:80:54.000
you think there are so many theories of consciousness out

1013
00:80:54.009 --> 00:80:57.430
there? And uh would you have a solution for

1014
00:80:57.439 --> 00:81:01.588
how we should actually approach it that we all have

1015
00:81:01.689 --> 00:81:05.859
a conscious experience? So maybe we feel entitled,

1016
00:81:06.708 --> 00:81:15.149
but we also experience cognitive impenetrability, which means that

1017
00:81:16.128 --> 00:81:20.569
in our daily experience, if you don't study neuroscience

1018
00:81:21.029 --> 00:81:23.989
, you don't even know you have a brain.

1019
00:81:24.560 --> 00:81:29.509
And for hundreds of years, people thought that our

1020
00:81:29.520 --> 00:81:32.689
experience was in our pancreas or our liver or you

1021
00:81:32.699 --> 00:81:39.088
know, so um you can't introspect the answer.

1022
00:81:39.829 --> 00:81:44.949
Mhm And so I don't believe that a theory which

1023
00:81:44.958 --> 00:81:50.020
discusses consciousness is a theory of consciousness. Unless it

1024
00:81:50.029 --> 00:81:58.369
can show how interacting brain processes give rise to conscious

1025
00:81:58.378 --> 00:82:04.509
psychological experiences, you have to make the link and

1026
00:82:04.520 --> 00:82:09.739
without a linking hypothesis between brain and mind, brain

1027
00:82:09.750 --> 00:82:15.430
processes have no functional role and psychological processes have no

1028
00:82:15.520 --> 00:82:19.619
mechanistic explanation. So you're high and dry. Now

1029
00:82:19.628 --> 00:82:24.798
, as I mentioned, I'm lucky, I started

1030
00:82:25.128 --> 00:82:30.930
passionately studying psychology as a 17 year old. And

1031
00:82:30.939 --> 00:82:33.399
that drove me because I always think in real time

1032
00:82:34.329 --> 00:82:40.310
into studying brain dynamics, I I didn't mention but

1033
00:82:40.958 --> 00:82:45.750
I was driven into neural networks to explain data about

1034
00:82:45.369 --> 00:82:47.979
verbal learning, serial, verbal learning, how we

1035
00:82:47.989 --> 00:82:53.819
learn lists of anything. And I didn't know they

1036
00:82:53.829 --> 00:82:57.180
were neural networks. I had never studied, I

1037
00:82:57.189 --> 00:83:00.689
was a freshman after all cell bodies of neurons,

1038
00:83:00.699 --> 00:83:06.529
axons, synapses, synoptic knobs, transmitters, action

1039
00:83:06.539 --> 00:83:11.020
potentials. They were all in my model from a

1040
00:83:11.029 --> 00:83:14.939
psychological derivation. And so only when I talked to

1041
00:83:14.949 --> 00:83:18.850
pre-med, friends who were studying it in their pre-med

1042
00:83:18.859 --> 00:83:23.520
courses that I realized the things that they told me

1043
00:83:23.529 --> 00:83:28.079
they're learning, I already knew. So you have

1044
00:83:28.088 --> 00:83:31.649
to make that link. And from a very early

1045
00:83:31.659 --> 00:83:39.319
age, I discovered a way to penetrate cognitive and

1046
00:83:39.329 --> 00:83:44.029
penetrability and people who want to know how I've done

1047
00:83:44.039 --> 00:83:47.789
it and others have tried to do it. Um

1048
00:83:48.500 --> 00:83:51.680
They should read my book and then if they get

1049
00:83:51.689 --> 00:83:56.560
really interested. Um If you go to my web

1050
00:83:56.569 --> 00:84:02.390
page, which is just sites, si Tes dot

1051
00:84:02.399 --> 00:84:15.640
Bu for Boston university.edu/, Steve Gsteveg sites W to

1052
00:84:15.649 --> 00:84:19.918
use flash Steve G, you'll see maybe 570 archival

1053
00:84:19.930 --> 00:84:27.100
articles and quite a few videos of self-contained lectures and

1054
00:84:27.109 --> 00:84:30.350
interviews to learn more about it in detail. But

1055
00:84:30.699 --> 00:84:34.569
my book is one is a good, you know

1056
00:84:35.229 --> 00:84:40.479
, one place to go shopping for this information.

1057
00:84:40.489 --> 00:84:45.119
There are 17 chapters on different stuff and it covers

1058
00:84:45.470 --> 00:84:51.378
a lot of stuff. So yeah, yeah.

1059
00:84:51.390 --> 00:84:58.640
So what makes me frustrated with some very well known

1060
00:84:58.649 --> 00:85:02.930
scientists? I won't mention like the quantum guys if

1061
00:85:02.939 --> 00:85:09.579
they could explain even a tiny fraction of the amount

1062
00:85:09.588 --> 00:85:13.168
of data I've explained by that. I mean,

1063
00:85:13.708 --> 00:85:19.128
how brain dynamics give rise to parametric psychological experiences in

1064
00:85:19.140 --> 00:85:23.509
data. I would think they were making a serious

1065
00:85:23.520 --> 00:85:30.418
contribution but they don't even try and, and they

1066
00:85:30.430 --> 00:85:33.918
never try to compare their contribution with mine, which

1067
00:85:33.930 --> 00:85:38.048
I just feel is unscientific. It's not how I

1068
00:85:38.060 --> 00:85:43.029
was brought up beyond bad manners. It's unscientific,

1069
00:85:44.119 --> 00:85:49.088
which is the severe criticism in my lexicon. So

1070
00:85:49.100 --> 00:85:53.270
let's move ahead here. I I think that earlier

1071
00:85:53.279 --> 00:85:57.208
we've already touched on what consciousness is good for and

1072
00:85:57.220 --> 00:86:01.668
you've also explained what resonance states and resonance mean.

1073
00:86:01.680 --> 00:86:05.104
So I mean, another thing that people many times

1074
00:86:05.114 --> 00:86:09.543
bring to the table when talking about consciousness, particularly

1075
00:86:09.634 --> 00:86:12.685
the philosophers. And this is something that was coined

1076
00:86:12.694 --> 00:86:15.895
, I guess by uh David Chalmers in the nineties

1077
00:86:15.904 --> 00:86:17.645
is the hard problem of consciousness. Do you think

1078
00:86:17.654 --> 00:86:23.548
that it can be solved scientifically? Well, let

1079
00:86:23.560 --> 00:86:27.939
me, um of course, it depends how you

1080
00:86:27.989 --> 00:86:31.640
define it. Let me just read first Wikipedia says

1081
00:86:32.140 --> 00:86:35.819
, and I'll quote, the hard problem of consciousness

1082
00:86:35.829 --> 00:86:41.369
is the problem of explaining how and why we have

1083
00:86:41.378 --> 00:86:50.128
quality or phenomenal experiences, um how sensations acquire characteristics

1084
00:86:50.140 --> 00:86:54.819
such as colors and taste. So to a certain

1085
00:86:54.829 --> 00:86:57.859
extent, and I will come back to this moment

1086
00:86:57.869 --> 00:87:01.069
. All my theories do just that. Like my

1087
00:87:01.560 --> 00:87:05.350
theory of vision is trying to explain how we see

1088
00:87:05.798 --> 00:87:09.958
, you know, boundaries surf, you know,

1089
00:87:10.609 --> 00:87:15.399
shading texture, color, all these properties of surfaces

1090
00:87:15.409 --> 00:87:16.750
, paintings and so on. But let me just

1091
00:87:16.759 --> 00:87:20.890
give another quote from Nagel in 74. He wrote

1092
00:87:20.899 --> 00:87:25.298
in part when we see, for example, we

1093
00:87:25.310 --> 00:87:30.548
experience visual sensations, the felt quality of redness,

1094
00:87:30.560 --> 00:87:32.970
the experience of dark and light, the quality of

1095
00:87:32.979 --> 00:87:38.798
depth in a visual field. Other experiences go along

1096
00:87:38.810 --> 00:87:41.458
with perception and different modalities, the sound of a

1097
00:87:41.470 --> 00:87:45.470
clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Well, um

1098
00:87:46.939 --> 00:87:51.489
one can give a scientific explanation of what's going on

1099
00:87:51.500 --> 00:87:55.609
in your brain when you see red, dark and

1100
00:87:55.619 --> 00:88:03.958
light depth, um sounds of instruments, but no

1101
00:88:03.970 --> 00:88:12.890
theory in science that's defined by mathematical equations as all

1102
00:88:12.899 --> 00:88:16.649
scientific theories to the present have can experience the color

1103
00:88:16.659 --> 00:88:24.458
red or any other conscious qualia equations don't have qualia

1104
00:88:25.350 --> 00:88:30.989
. But in other sciences um like I I love

1105
00:88:31.000 --> 00:88:38.159
this uh quote after you've read Lamb's huge treatise on

1106
00:88:38.168 --> 00:88:42.899
hydrodynamics, you still don't know that water is wet

1107
00:88:43.918 --> 00:88:45.588
, but you know, just about everything you'd ever

1108
00:88:45.600 --> 00:88:51.699
wanna know about water and other fluids, including air

1109
00:88:53.680 --> 00:88:59.220
um to design airplanes that fly boats that float on

1110
00:88:59.229 --> 00:89:02.579
the surface of marines. You have an effective understanding

1111
00:89:03.458 --> 00:89:09.689
of water and the fact that you don't know it's

1112
00:89:09.699 --> 00:89:14.918
wet matters less and less because you can give a

1113
00:89:14.930 --> 00:89:20.798
scientific explanation of what is happening. First, what

1114
00:89:21.449 --> 00:89:28.250
characterizes the state of a liquid versus a gas versus

1115
00:89:28.259 --> 00:89:30.779
solid through the molecular theory of gasses and this and

1116
00:89:30.789 --> 00:89:34.859
that and the other thing. So it just doesn't

1117
00:89:34.869 --> 00:89:39.949
matter after a while. And so in my life

1118
00:89:40.668 --> 00:89:47.680
, given what I know that I know um the

1119
00:89:47.689 --> 00:89:56.180
fact that I'm seeing beautiful colors around me, I

1120
00:89:56.329 --> 00:90:00.569
can understand a lot of how that is happening and

1121
00:90:00.579 --> 00:90:04.009
it is outside what an equation I can give you

1122
00:90:04.020 --> 00:90:10.390
representations of the objects and the colors and their forms

1123
00:90:10.399 --> 00:90:15.560
and their brightnesses. But I can't say why it

1124
00:90:15.569 --> 00:90:18.759
looks red. I can't because an equation can't do

1125
00:90:18.770 --> 00:90:23.369
that. And the the, but the answer is

1126
00:90:23.680 --> 00:90:27.819
an equation can't do that in any science. You

1127
00:90:27.829 --> 00:90:34.250
know, there's this famous um uh example, I

1128
00:90:34.259 --> 00:90:39.369
hope I'm remembering it right? You know, when

1129
00:90:39.378 --> 00:90:45.378
um astronauts were coming down and landing and they landed

1130
00:90:45.390 --> 00:90:49.009
somewhere in, I don't know, Arizona or wherever

1131
00:90:49.020 --> 00:90:53.850
or wherever, there was a flat arid surface.

1132
00:90:54.609 --> 00:90:58.000
And the first thing I guess maybe these were the

1133
00:90:58.009 --> 00:91:00.199
first guys to the moon. I don't remember.

1134
00:91:00.569 --> 00:91:02.878
But the, the, the anecdote is the first

1135
00:91:02.890 --> 00:91:08.628
thing they said when they got out was the bump

1136
00:91:08.640 --> 00:91:12.918
, was there? Meaning that the computation of their

1137
00:91:13.279 --> 00:91:18.989
trajectory coming in to the atmosphere predicted there would be

1138
00:91:19.000 --> 00:91:24.609
a little bump and it was there. But that's

1139
00:91:24.619 --> 00:91:30.489
not the same thing as the qualia uh f experiencing

1140
00:91:30.500 --> 00:91:36.668
the bump. Uh So science can be effective and

1141
00:91:36.680 --> 00:91:42.250
useful, but I do think it's outside the province

1142
00:91:42.509 --> 00:91:47.779
of equations to say why water feels wet, you

1143
00:91:47.789 --> 00:91:50.939
know, we can say why a fluid has certain

1144
00:91:50.949 --> 00:91:56.310
properties but why it feels wet. I, I

1145
00:91:56.319 --> 00:91:59.739
don't think equations can do and if someone can,

1146
00:91:59.750 --> 00:92:04.390
I, I will study them passionately. I don't

1147
00:92:04.399 --> 00:92:06.750
see how it can be done in principle though.

1148
00:92:08.289 --> 00:92:12.859
Mhm So uh let's talk here a little bit about

1149
00:92:12.869 --> 00:92:16.850
some of the applications of the way you approach consciousness

1150
00:92:16.859 --> 00:92:19.140
in your book. Before, toward the end,

1151
00:92:19.149 --> 00:92:24.229
we talk a little bit about uh principles of brain

1152
00:92:24.239 --> 00:92:27.958
design and some other general questions. So do you

1153
00:92:27.970 --> 00:92:31.979
think that your approach to consciousness would have any implications

1154
00:92:31.989 --> 00:92:38.819
for the way we understand mental disorders? Well,

1155
00:92:39.109 --> 00:92:43.989
um this is one of the things I call an

1156
00:92:44.000 --> 00:92:47.640
acquired taste, just like consciousness was an acquire taste

1157
00:92:47.649 --> 00:92:51.250
. It's not something I ever dreamed I'd have anything

1158
00:92:51.259 --> 00:92:57.140
to offer. Um But so all of the neural

1159
00:92:57.149 --> 00:93:01.759
models start by studying the brain dynamics and mental functions

1160
00:93:01.770 --> 00:93:08.560
of normal or typical individuals because there are vast databases

1161
00:93:08.569 --> 00:93:12.680
on that, you know, many hundreds thousands of

1162
00:93:12.689 --> 00:93:15.180
scientists. Like if you go to the annual meeting

1163
00:93:15.189 --> 00:93:18.548
of the Society for Neuroscience, I think a recent

1164
00:93:18.560 --> 00:93:25.949
meeting at 26,000 scientists, they're all doing incredible work

1165
00:93:26.909 --> 00:93:30.298
, huge databases. But at a certain point,

1166
00:93:30.949 --> 00:93:38.229
I noticed that if some of the processes get imbalanced

1167
00:93:38.239 --> 00:93:44.569
or damaged in specific ways, then I could see

1168
00:93:44.579 --> 00:93:51.000
formal behavioral symptoms of mental disorders emerged. And,

1169
00:93:51.009 --> 00:93:53.869
you know, I just had to notice that it

1170
00:93:53.878 --> 00:93:58.229
was in the model. Uh And so it's in

1171
00:93:58.239 --> 00:94:03.048
this spirit, I've so far explained behavioral symptoms based

1172
00:94:03.060 --> 00:94:12.859
on precisely defined imbalances. Remember, complementary computing is

1173
00:94:12.869 --> 00:94:18.259
a balancing act or, or actual lesions in Alzheimer's

1174
00:94:18.270 --> 00:94:24.509
disease, autism, uh Fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia

1175
00:94:25.168 --> 00:94:29.759
, medial temporal amnesia, visual and auditory amnesia and

1176
00:94:29.770 --> 00:94:32.149
neglect and problems of slow wave sleep. So that

1177
00:94:32.159 --> 00:94:34.229
came in through the back door just like all of

1178
00:94:34.239 --> 00:94:36.539
it is. So the moral of the story for

1179
00:94:36.548 --> 00:94:44.619
young scientist is uh don't look for shortcuts, uh

1180
00:94:44.628 --> 00:94:50.079
try to understand the underlying principles and designs. Uh

1181
00:94:50.298 --> 00:94:54.470
And then try to model it in an authentic and

1182
00:94:54.479 --> 00:94:59.220
serious way. It's hard work. Uh Sometimes I

1183
00:94:59.229 --> 00:95:02.579
wasn't ready to even write down anything about a problem

1184
00:95:02.588 --> 00:95:09.180
for 10 or 20 years until I'd accumulated enough uh

1185
00:95:09.199 --> 00:95:14.739
information to be able to proceed. But then uh

1186
00:95:15.418 --> 00:95:17.079
I like saying it's the gift that keeps on giving

1187
00:95:17.949 --> 00:95:21.088
consciousness was part of the gift that kept on giving

1188
00:95:21.739 --> 00:95:25.350
, understanding a little bit of mental disorder is part

1189
00:95:25.359 --> 00:95:28.560
of the gift that kept on giving. So if

1190
00:95:28.569 --> 00:95:30.529
you try to get to the heart of the matter

1191
00:95:30.539 --> 00:95:36.609
, it's richness will reward you many times over.

1192
00:95:38.000 --> 00:95:40.890
But I've been lucky because I started very young.

1193
00:95:41.628 --> 00:95:45.708
And even though it's controversial for quite a few years

1194
00:95:45.930 --> 00:95:50.298
before neural networks were even a thing, there were

1195
00:95:50.310 --> 00:95:58.239
always enough people in Washington who had faith in me

1196
00:95:58.250 --> 00:96:00.750
and the work to give us enough funding to do

1197
00:96:00.759 --> 00:96:05.199
the work. And it's not like the kind of

1198
00:96:05.208 --> 00:96:11.180
funding where you need 50 million to get a fancy

1199
00:96:11.189 --> 00:96:15.770
machine. All the money that supported me paid for

1200
00:96:16.509 --> 00:96:21.810
uh graduate fellows ships and postdocs uh for people to

1201
00:96:21.819 --> 00:96:25.659
learn from me and learn to do science with me

1202
00:96:26.048 --> 00:96:30.659
. So it's pennies on the dollar was a good

1203
00:96:30.668 --> 00:96:36.979
investment anyway. Um Did that say enough about that

1204
00:96:38.259 --> 00:96:41.539
? Mhm. Uh And another topic that you also

1205
00:96:41.548 --> 00:96:46.270
cover in your book is irrational decisions. What is

1206
00:96:46.279 --> 00:96:50.659
, what is an irrational decision exactly? And why

1207
00:96:50.668 --> 00:96:55.539
do we make them? Well, you know,

1208
00:96:55.548 --> 00:96:59.088
there are several different kinds and uh let me just

1209
00:96:59.100 --> 00:97:01.899
make a comment before I focus on one kind in

1210
00:97:01.909 --> 00:97:08.168
general. If a decision fails to achieve one's goal

1211
00:97:08.628 --> 00:97:12.770
, when another decision that would achieve the goals readily

1212
00:97:12.779 --> 00:97:15.619
available, it wasn't chosen. We may want to

1213
00:97:15.628 --> 00:97:18.350
say they were being irrational, you know, and

1214
00:97:18.359 --> 00:97:23.189
just like in cognitive emotional interactions, you might have

1215
00:97:23.199 --> 00:97:26.970
feelings about stuff and you just can't bring yourself to

1216
00:97:26.979 --> 00:97:30.609
do it. Uh And there are many factors that

1217
00:97:30.619 --> 00:97:33.810
can cause it, including an experience with this kind

1218
00:97:33.819 --> 00:97:38.069
of decision making or the need to make a quick

1219
00:97:38.079 --> 00:97:40.810
decision around the stress. You know, there are

1220
00:97:40.819 --> 00:97:45.979
speed accuracy, trade-off problems. But the most famous

1221
00:97:45.989 --> 00:97:50.500
psychological database concerns what's called decision making under risk.

1222
00:97:51.029 --> 00:97:58.958
That is decisions in situations that are uncertain because the

1223
00:97:58.970 --> 00:98:03.009
outcomes are defined by probabilities. You know, if

1224
00:98:03.020 --> 00:98:05.708
you do this and that the probability of getting this

1225
00:98:05.720 --> 00:98:10.039
payoff is that if you do that and this the

1226
00:98:10.048 --> 00:98:13.798
probability of getting that pay off is that and which

1227
00:98:13.810 --> 00:98:19.128
do people choose? And um Danny Conman and Amos

1228
00:98:19.829 --> 00:98:26.208
Tversky won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for

1229
00:98:26.220 --> 00:98:30.689
their experiments in an algebraic model. They published to

1230
00:98:30.699 --> 00:98:39.000
fit that data in 1979 explaining paradoxical properties of irrational

1231
00:98:39.009 --> 00:98:44.958
decision making in probabilistic environments and their algebraic model,

1232
00:98:44.970 --> 00:98:48.189
which is, you know, phenomenological model that tries

1233
00:98:48.199 --> 00:98:50.439
to compress the description of the data. And it

1234
00:98:50.449 --> 00:98:56.659
is very useful, it's called prospect theory. But

1235
00:98:56.668 --> 00:99:00.560
then in 1987 I think my student, Bill Gutowski

1236
00:99:00.569 --> 00:99:04.859
and I uh went beyond it in a uh well

1237
00:99:04.869 --> 00:99:11.338
known article in psychological review. Uh because my article

1238
00:99:11.350 --> 00:99:16.418
with Bill introduced a real time neural network model,

1239
00:99:16.668 --> 00:99:20.958
we gave it a name because I started realizing you

1240
00:99:20.970 --> 00:99:25.168
got to name everything you don't need to prevent other

1241
00:99:25.180 --> 00:99:29.829
people from plagiarizing it. I won't stop them.

1242
00:99:29.838 --> 00:99:32.350
But at least you could say that's just uh affective

1243
00:99:32.359 --> 00:99:38.229
balance theory is what we called it that quantitatively explains

1244
00:99:38.239 --> 00:99:45.020
and simulated the Danny Kamman and Amos Tversky data as

1245
00:99:45.029 --> 00:99:49.989
emergent properties. And all we did was we applied

1246
00:99:50.628 --> 00:99:56.409
my already known cognitive emotional model to that data.

1247
00:99:57.199 --> 00:100:00.789
So we didn't do any more modeling. We showed

1248
00:100:00.798 --> 00:100:04.109
that their data fell out of the wash when the

1249
00:100:04.119 --> 00:100:10.259
model was exposed to the kind of risky environments like

1250
00:100:10.270 --> 00:100:16.909
those in prospect theory. So that I thought had

1251
00:100:16.918 --> 00:100:25.180
an important lesson that Darwinian selection does shape our mind

1252
00:100:25.189 --> 00:100:29.680
to be adaptive, but it it fails in certain

1253
00:100:29.689 --> 00:100:35.329
environments. Um You know, it can't anticipate every

1254
00:100:35.680 --> 00:100:40.810
kind of risky environment. And in the same spirit

1255
00:100:40.819 --> 00:100:44.039
in chapter 17, in my book, I summarize

1256
00:100:44.048 --> 00:100:48.779
other examples of irrational behaviors including superstitious and self punitive

1257
00:100:48.789 --> 00:100:54.930
behaviors in a similar way how in certain environments,

1258
00:100:54.939 --> 00:100:59.770
you know, and you know, um conspiratorial thinking

1259
00:100:59.779 --> 00:101:05.588
, sadly how certain social environments can support conspire uh

1260
00:101:05.600 --> 00:101:11.310
conspiracy kind of ideas which we see all too much

1261
00:101:11.668 --> 00:101:15.489
in the United States these days to say. So

1262
00:101:15.500 --> 00:101:18.759
my abstract with Bill I, I summarize a little

1263
00:101:18.770 --> 00:101:26.500
here. These explanations illustrate that the data concerning decision

1264
00:101:26.520 --> 00:101:30.378
making under risk may now be related to data concerning

1265
00:101:30.390 --> 00:101:35.909
the dynamics of condition and cognition and emotion as consequences

1266
00:101:35.918 --> 00:101:42.020
of single psychophysiological theory. So in other words,

1267
00:101:42.418 --> 00:101:45.189
you didn't have to build a new theory and it

1268
00:101:45.199 --> 00:101:50.449
really, and we explained some risky decision making data

1269
00:101:50.458 --> 00:101:55.699
that common and Tversky could not like pref what's called

1270
00:101:55.708 --> 00:102:00.668
preference reversals. So our theory is more powerful both

1271
00:102:00.680 --> 00:102:08.369
in the sense of um uh explaining their data as

1272
00:102:08.378 --> 00:102:13.359
the merchant properties of known brain on the motional dynamics

1273
00:102:13.789 --> 00:102:16.020
, but also explaining more data because Bill, you

1274
00:102:16.029 --> 00:102:21.479
know, didn't experiment uh on the uh preference reversals

1275
00:102:21.989 --> 00:102:25.680
. But you know, our paper was published in

1276
00:102:25.689 --> 00:102:31.180
87 uh Danny and Amos was in 79 They got

1277
00:102:31.189 --> 00:102:34.798
the Nobel Prize in 2002. We didn't share it

1278
00:102:35.789 --> 00:102:43.659
. So go figure. Well, uh so we've

1279
00:102:43.668 --> 00:102:46.149
already also touched on the or addressed the problem of

1280
00:102:46.159 --> 00:102:51.229
cognitive impenetrability. So let's talk about something that we

1281
00:102:51.239 --> 00:102:55.609
, you've alluded to in the beginning of our conversation

1282
00:102:55.619 --> 00:102:58.649
, that is A I system. So do you

1283
00:102:58.659 --> 00:103:01.509
think that having a better understanding of our brains give

1284
00:103:01.520 --> 00:103:06.069
rise to minds would also be important for designing A

1285
00:103:06.079 --> 00:103:10.750
I systems? Well, you know, today,

1286
00:103:11.168 --> 00:103:15.509
when people say the word A I, they usually

1287
00:103:15.520 --> 00:103:20.378
mean neural networks, which wasn't the case when A

1288
00:103:20.390 --> 00:103:26.350
I was symbolic, Marvin Minsky realized he ought to

1289
00:103:26.359 --> 00:103:28.810
get on the gravy train. In fact, there's

1290
00:103:28.819 --> 00:103:33.270
a funny anecdote about that. Uh Marvin Minsky and

1291
00:103:33.279 --> 00:103:36.779
Seymour Pappert when they were doing symbolic A I,

1292
00:103:38.220 --> 00:103:41.649
they were at MIT and I was an assistant professor

1293
00:103:42.319 --> 00:103:46.668
and they really attacked me brutally because I was doing

1294
00:103:47.140 --> 00:103:50.140
neural networks. And Marvin when he was a young

1295
00:103:50.149 --> 00:103:55.520
man tried to do neural networks and he failed.

1296
00:103:56.259 --> 00:103:59.338
And since Marvin was the smartest man in the world

1297
00:103:59.680 --> 00:104:02.000
. How can this little dipshit kid be allowed to

1298
00:104:02.009 --> 00:104:05.759
do neural networks? They attacked me. Anyway,

1299
00:104:05.770 --> 00:104:11.279
years later, after I'd found it and became first

1300
00:104:11.289 --> 00:104:15.970
president of the International Neural Network Society and the Archival

1301
00:104:15.979 --> 00:104:19.390
journal neural Networks. And I was veteran chief for

1302
00:104:19.399 --> 00:104:24.458
many years, I had a lot of influence over

1303
00:104:24.470 --> 00:104:30.159
the organization of international conferences on neural networks. And

1304
00:104:30.168 --> 00:104:32.560
I said, let's invite Marvin Minsky because he had

1305
00:104:32.569 --> 00:104:38.079
just written his book Society of Mind, which basically

1306
00:104:38.088 --> 00:104:41.289
was just plagiarism. But hey, that was nothing

1307
00:104:41.298 --> 00:104:43.958
new for the People in Tech Square. And I

1308
00:104:43.970 --> 00:104:45.819
figured, let's hear what Marvin has to say.

1309
00:104:47.500 --> 00:104:53.619
Sadly, Marvin ever prepared. Um But he got

1310
00:104:53.628 --> 00:104:57.109
up and the first thing he said was there are

1311
00:104:57.119 --> 00:104:59.989
two things I regret in my life. One was

1312
00:105:00.109 --> 00:105:05.529
I underestimated gross Burt. And then he, the

1313
00:105:05.539 --> 00:105:10.569
rest of his presentation was telling jokes, he wasn't

1314
00:105:10.579 --> 00:105:15.430
prepared poor Marvin. He was such an egotist amazing

1315
00:105:15.489 --> 00:105:17.909
. And you know, he did some useful earlier

1316
00:105:17.918 --> 00:105:21.869
work and then he just, you know, shoveled

1317
00:105:21.878 --> 00:105:29.418
in the guilt anyway. Uh What can I say

1318
00:105:29.949 --> 00:105:38.958
? So my neural networks illustrate autonomous adaptive intelligence and

1319
00:105:38.970 --> 00:105:41.298
not all neural networks do. So I was trying

1320
00:105:41.310 --> 00:105:45.159
to say now when people say neural networks or a

1321
00:105:45.168 --> 00:105:49.220
I, they usually mean deep learning. And uh

1322
00:105:49.229 --> 00:105:51.909
I published a paper a few years ago because I

1323
00:105:51.918 --> 00:105:58.479
was invited to where I explain why deep learning is

1324
00:105:58.489 --> 00:106:03.229
untrustworthy because it's not explainable. Mm If you make

1325
00:106:03.239 --> 00:106:06.539
a prediction, using deep learning and let's say it's

1326
00:106:06.548 --> 00:106:11.798
a medical prediction and someone dies as a result.

1327
00:106:12.270 --> 00:106:15.470
And the surviving family are grief stricken and they say

1328
00:106:15.729 --> 00:106:18.668
, why did you tell the doctor to do that

1329
00:106:19.430 --> 00:106:21.329
? And your answer would be, I don't know

1330
00:106:23.418 --> 00:106:26.279
, you're gonna be sued out for everything you're worth

1331
00:106:26.949 --> 00:106:30.680
. So it's untrustworthy because is unexplainable and it's unreliable

1332
00:106:30.689 --> 00:106:35.430
because it can experience catastrophic forgetting. In fact,

1333
00:106:35.439 --> 00:106:40.270
in 1988 I wrote a off sighed paper that I

1334
00:106:40.279 --> 00:106:45.168
review in my magnum opus with 17 prop problems that

1335
00:106:45.918 --> 00:106:49.838
back propagation which deep learning uses as its learning engine

1336
00:106:50.259 --> 00:106:56.569
still has that art never had and yet they still

1337
00:106:56.579 --> 00:107:00.338
choose not to use it. So deep learning is

1338
00:107:00.350 --> 00:107:05.079
deeply flawed and then chat GP t you know,

1339
00:107:05.088 --> 00:107:08.759
a generative A I, I mean, you know

1340
00:107:08.770 --> 00:107:13.779
, they've thrown into it immense databases, they scrub

1341
00:107:13.789 --> 00:107:18.918
the internet. And so perhaps not surprisingly, it

1342
00:107:18.930 --> 00:107:27.640
can generate a lot of phrases and sentences that sound

1343
00:107:27.649 --> 00:107:31.140
intelligent. But basically, you know, it starts

1344
00:107:31.149 --> 00:107:36.619
with a sentential context and has a probabilistic algorithm for

1345
00:107:36.628 --> 00:107:42.140
trying to guess what to say next. The foundational

1346
00:107:42.149 --> 00:107:45.039
problems are, it has no goals, it has

1347
00:107:45.048 --> 00:107:48.739
no meaning and it literally does not know what it's

1348
00:107:48.750 --> 00:107:56.338
talking about literally. And in fact, um on

1349
00:107:56.350 --> 00:108:00.250
the connections website now, I don't know if you

1350
00:108:00.259 --> 00:108:04.918
follow it. There's been this very heated discussion of

1351
00:108:04.930 --> 00:108:12.619
this uh attack uh on A I of this kind

1352
00:108:12.789 --> 00:108:16.819
led by Gary Marcus who's a professor at NYU and

1353
00:108:16.829 --> 00:108:21.119
everything they're saying against it is correct. But I

1354
00:108:21.128 --> 00:108:26.569
believe the future of humanity will benefit from an A

1355
00:108:26.579 --> 00:108:31.739
I that is increasingly autonomous, adaptive and intelligent in

1356
00:108:31.750 --> 00:108:36.918
its algorithms, machines and mobile robots, especially ones

1357
00:108:36.930 --> 00:108:42.890
that embody brain inspired designs because these are the ones

1358
00:108:42.899 --> 00:108:51.918
that can seamlessly interact in brain machine uh um co-operative

1359
00:108:51.930 --> 00:108:59.720
ventures. And I'm the guy who's led that and

1360
00:108:59.729 --> 00:109:02.128
we're well on the way to it in terms of

1361
00:109:02.140 --> 00:109:05.119
meaning, you know, I don't want to presume

1362
00:109:05.128 --> 00:109:09.009
that everything's understood. In fact, just last year

1363
00:109:10.180 --> 00:109:15.259
I published an article on my web page about how

1364
00:109:15.270 --> 00:109:20.180
Children learn in real time from their parents and other

1365
00:109:20.189 --> 00:109:27.310
teachers to learn effective and perceptual language meanings. It's

1366
00:109:27.319 --> 00:109:30.699
not in my book. I wasn't ready to write

1367
00:109:30.708 --> 00:109:34.970
that paper till last year and that's just the beginning

1368
00:109:34.979 --> 00:109:41.298
of what has to be a huge a research program

1369
00:109:41.310 --> 00:109:45.298
that I clearly will not live to see completed.

1370
00:109:45.199 --> 00:109:51.140
But at least now there's that foundation you can't say

1371
00:109:51.149 --> 00:109:54.819
as people in a, I used to do all

1372
00:109:54.829 --> 00:109:57.759
the time with the best game in town. They've

1373
00:109:57.770 --> 00:110:00.659
never been the best game in town, but they

1374
00:110:00.668 --> 00:110:04.470
spend so much time marketing with people like me,

1375
00:110:04.479 --> 00:110:11.579
spend so much time thinking and writing and discovering I

1376
00:110:12.250 --> 00:110:14.640
, I can't do that. That's not why I

1377
00:110:14.649 --> 00:110:20.588
wanna stay alive. Um Yeah. So should I

1378
00:110:20.600 --> 00:110:24.088
say, uh maybe I'll say, you know,

1379
00:110:24.100 --> 00:110:29.829
the best example of autonomous adaptive intelligence is the human

1380
00:110:29.838 --> 00:110:32.720
mind. We're autonomous because we can act on our

1381
00:110:32.729 --> 00:110:38.069
own. We're adaptive because we can learn throughout life

1382
00:110:38.359 --> 00:110:42.850
because we solve the stability plasticity dilemma. And we're

1383
00:110:42.859 --> 00:110:45.548
intelligent. Hm, at least in the sense that

1384
00:110:45.560 --> 00:110:50.199
we can as a species make wise enough decisions and

1385
00:110:50.208 --> 00:110:56.548
plans to create civilizations, even though we can be

1386
00:110:56.560 --> 00:111:01.859
superstitious, conspiratorial, terribly cruel and violent as well

1387
00:111:02.600 --> 00:111:05.930
. And the end of my book discusses, you

1388
00:111:05.939 --> 00:111:11.529
know, why they and you know, there's a

1389
00:111:11.539 --> 00:111:16.060
kind of Yin Yang in the human mind and good

1390
00:111:16.069 --> 00:111:19.628
and evil are built right into us. But I

1391
00:111:19.909 --> 00:111:27.739
also try to clarify why good has a a leg

1392
00:111:27.750 --> 00:111:34.229
up. Um because bad things usually pub punished and

1393
00:111:34.239 --> 00:111:40.458
either suppressed or avoided where you can, good things

1394
00:111:40.470 --> 00:111:44.770
can be sustained and you can build beautiful things,

1395
00:111:44.779 --> 00:111:47.640
important, useful things on them. So there's a

1396
00:111:47.649 --> 00:111:54.539
broken symmetry and evolution between good and evil and our

1397
00:111:54.548 --> 00:111:58.869
lives depend on it. Uh So talking about good

1398
00:111:58.878 --> 00:112:01.329
and evil and you also mentioned a little bit earlier

1399
00:112:01.338 --> 00:112:05.020
. Superstition. Uh does the approach that you present

1400
00:112:05.029 --> 00:112:10.310
in the book will also have implications for how we

1401
00:112:10.319 --> 00:112:15.100
understand things like morality, religion, creativity and the

1402
00:112:15.109 --> 00:112:18.739
human condition where I guess many of these topics are

1403
00:112:18.750 --> 00:112:25.810
traditionally uh approached in philosophy. Yeah. Well,

1404
00:112:27.168 --> 00:112:33.060
um remember that Newton thought he was doing natural philosophy

1405
00:112:33.699 --> 00:112:40.020
when you do deep science, it gets philosophical,

1406
00:112:40.489 --> 00:112:45.250
deep philosophical. Um Well, I wanna do a

1407
00:112:45.259 --> 00:112:50.100
quote chapter 17 in my book, likely discusses some

1408
00:112:50.109 --> 00:112:54.168
of these, the things they could be discussed much

1409
00:112:54.180 --> 00:113:02.069
more, more extensively on page 621 of the header

1410
00:113:02.079 --> 00:113:05.520
of this section in question is more or less what

1411
00:113:05.529 --> 00:113:10.609
I was just talking about symmetry breaking of positive and

1412
00:113:10.619 --> 00:113:14.369
negative in cognition and emotion, coal and a reason

1413
00:113:14.378 --> 00:113:17.199
for hope. I think hope is an important word

1414
00:113:17.208 --> 00:113:23.659
and especially in our crazy world. Let me just

1415
00:113:23.668 --> 00:113:26.909
quote it. It's not too long as with all

1416
00:113:26.918 --> 00:113:30.708
predictive behaviors. There are cognitive and emotional reasons for

1417
00:113:30.720 --> 00:113:35.720
morality that are built into the most basic properties of

1418
00:113:35.729 --> 00:113:40.750
our brains in both cognition and emotion. There is

1419
00:113:40.759 --> 00:113:45.548
, I'll argue a broken symmetry between positive and negative

1420
00:113:45.560 --> 00:113:50.930
processes with the positive emphasized because it is just a

1421
00:113:50.939 --> 00:113:56.020
broken symmetry. Much as every source of light can

1422
00:113:56.029 --> 00:113:59.699
cast a shadow, both good and evil deeds are

1423
00:113:59.708 --> 00:114:02.100
possible. Although I would claim there's a built in

1424
00:114:02.109 --> 00:114:09.479
bias toward the good so that values aren't purely relative

1425
00:114:11.128 --> 00:114:14.350
. And as I was just indicating, uh an

1426
00:114:14.359 --> 00:114:16.829
example of the broken symmetry is that bad deeds are

1427
00:114:16.838 --> 00:114:25.609
punished and punishment suppresses behavior uh which causes us to

1428
00:114:25.619 --> 00:114:29.470
avoid them. Uh And if you don't avoid them

1429
00:114:29.479 --> 00:114:31.939
, you end up in jail or worse, whereas

1430
00:114:31.949 --> 00:114:38.168
good deeds are rewarded and thus can be sustained and

1431
00:114:38.180 --> 00:114:43.779
built upon. Um And I believe in that very

1432
00:114:43.789 --> 00:114:46.208
much, you know, it's a broken symmetry that's

1433
00:114:46.220 --> 00:114:53.909
not very romantic, but I think understanding it,

1434
00:114:53.918 --> 00:114:55.708
you know, you don't have to understand much more

1435
00:114:55.720 --> 00:115:00.689
than on the level I said is very clarifying a

1436
00:115:00.699 --> 00:115:05.199
lot of our development and evolution due to broken symmetries

1437
00:115:06.029 --> 00:115:10.609
. Um you know, and just look at us

1438
00:115:10.619 --> 00:115:15.779
, we're bilaterally symmetric but with broken, you know

1439
00:115:15.789 --> 00:115:17.930
, we have a dominant hemisphere in our cortex,

1440
00:115:18.699 --> 00:115:21.520
uh we can be right handed or left handed.

1441
00:115:23.259 --> 00:115:28.689
So we are broken but we are symmetric and is

1442
00:115:28.699 --> 00:115:31.939
built into everything. And I believe that a lot

1443
00:115:31.949 --> 00:115:36.458
of uh the origin of the universe, although I

1444
00:115:36.470 --> 00:115:40.649
shouldn't talk about things I know nothing about. I

1445
00:115:40.659 --> 00:115:42.708
, well, not, not that I know nothing

1446
00:115:42.720 --> 00:115:45.569
but I think a lot of broken symmetries drove evolution

1447
00:115:47.069 --> 00:115:53.750
. So, so uh let's uh we've already also

1448
00:115:53.759 --> 00:115:59.409
talked earlier about the brain design principles that you uh

1449
00:115:59.439 --> 00:116:01.699
uh go through in the book Complementarity and Certainty and

1450
00:116:01.708 --> 00:116:04.899
Resonance. So perhaps let, let's go back to

1451
00:116:04.909 --> 00:116:09.729
the very beginning of our conversation when I asked you

1452
00:116:09.739 --> 00:116:15.088
about when psychology slash neuroscience and physics diverged in terms

1453
00:116:15.100 --> 00:116:17.829
of their approach to the brain and the mind.

1454
00:116:17.890 --> 00:116:20.520
Do you think that the paradigm you present in your

1455
00:116:20.529 --> 00:116:27.039
book can help unify them again? Well, let

1456
00:116:27.048 --> 00:116:29.338
me quote again from my book and then if uh

1457
00:116:29.350 --> 00:116:32.680
maybe I'll make some other comments on pages 635 and

1458
00:116:32.689 --> 00:116:39.560
636. Again, chapter 17, as I explained

1459
00:116:39.569 --> 00:116:45.180
in chapter five, brains can also bind into coherent

1460
00:116:45.189 --> 00:116:51.930
moments of conscious experience within a unified self measurements taken

1461
00:116:51.939 --> 00:116:58.529
from multiple physical sources light sound pressure, temperature,

1462
00:116:59.060 --> 00:117:04.489
bodily biochemical processes and the like. Um so like

1463
00:117:04.500 --> 00:117:06.539
when someone asks, how do you feel today?

1464
00:117:08.020 --> 00:117:11.039
You can tell them all sorts of stuff. And

1465
00:117:11.048 --> 00:117:14.470
it's not just like, you know, I have

1466
00:117:14.479 --> 00:117:16.539
a light meter, a sound meter, a pressure

1467
00:117:16.548 --> 00:117:20.119
meter, it's all unified into a coherent moment of

1468
00:117:20.128 --> 00:117:27.439
conscious awareness. So the brain is also a universal

1469
00:117:28.180 --> 00:117:31.119
. Remember I talk a little about that self organizing

1470
00:117:32.270 --> 00:117:35.689
measurement system of the world and in the world.

1471
00:117:38.369 --> 00:117:42.189
Um chapter one explained that due to this universal measurement

1472
00:117:42.199 --> 00:117:46.048
process, brains may play a role that'll be compared

1473
00:117:46.060 --> 00:117:50.189
with the role played by played in physics by Max

1474
00:117:50.199 --> 00:117:55.588
Planck's law of black body radiation. Cause by describing

1475
00:117:55.600 --> 00:118:00.560
a radiation spectrum that's universal across all matter planks,

1476
00:118:00.918 --> 00:118:05.430
lushes and quantum mechanics. Whereby to explain all subatomic

1477
00:118:05.838 --> 00:118:12.588
phenomena, the brain's universal measurement process can be expected

1478
00:118:12.600 --> 00:118:16.989
to have a comparable impact on future science. So

1479
00:118:17.878 --> 00:118:24.259
, you know, we don't, our brains don't

1480
00:118:25.039 --> 00:118:27.659
function when it comes to cognition, emotion, et

1481
00:118:27.668 --> 00:118:32.569
cetera on a quantum level. Um you know,

1482
00:118:33.239 --> 00:118:40.088
even if there are uh noisy fluctuations in individual cells

1483
00:118:41.020 --> 00:118:47.699
, often cell populations have mean activities uh that are

1484
00:118:47.708 --> 00:118:53.168
much larger than the variants. So we can have

1485
00:118:53.250 --> 00:119:00.548
a a kind of um uh deterministic or mean field

1486
00:119:01.390 --> 00:119:10.560
dynamic equations or operating dynamics that's not operating uh with

1487
00:119:10.569 --> 00:119:15.479
quantum fluctuations uh needed to be considered. But we

1488
00:119:15.489 --> 00:119:20.489
have this universality in terms of all these physical fields

1489
00:119:20.500 --> 00:119:28.500
as a measurement device that's self organizing. And I

1490
00:119:28.509 --> 00:119:34.939
um also in chapter 17, talk about how some

1491
00:119:34.949 --> 00:119:45.548
of these principles um like complementarity uncertainty and resonance operate

1492
00:119:45.119 --> 00:119:51.470
even in single non neural cells, a a very

1493
00:119:51.479 --> 00:120:00.500
primitive uh cell types that have existed long before humans

1494
00:120:01.430 --> 00:120:06.569
. So there is a universal developmental code in which

1495
00:120:06.680 --> 00:120:13.668
art adaptive resonance is part of that larger code.

1496
00:120:13.680 --> 00:120:19.088
It is one example of the kind of resonance that

1497
00:120:19.100 --> 00:120:28.069
you find uh even in morphogenesis of very simple species

1498
00:120:29.048 --> 00:120:31.060
. Um So, you know, I talk about

1499
00:120:31.069 --> 00:120:36.079
the kind of resonance that occurs when a blastula becomes

1500
00:120:36.088 --> 00:120:45.208
a gastro, I talk about. Um uh well

1501
00:120:45.220 --> 00:120:46.878
, you know, read the book, I'm getting

1502
00:120:46.890 --> 00:120:50.279
a little worn out of my search and my brain

1503
00:120:50.289 --> 00:120:56.829
isn't. So there is a universal developmental code that

1504
00:120:56.838 --> 00:121:04.409
um that includes the things that we experience when our

1505
00:121:04.418 --> 00:121:10.989
brains start actually enabling us to remember what we know

1506
00:121:11.000 --> 00:121:15.279
about the world. And resonance goes way way back

1507
00:121:15.739 --> 00:121:18.689
in morphosis. And you know, I've always thought

1508
00:121:18.699 --> 00:121:21.708
, but you know, maybe if someone makes this

1509
00:121:23.279 --> 00:121:27.600
precise or shows its wrong, I've always thought of

1510
00:121:28.489 --> 00:121:33.378
um the double helix as an example of complementary computing

1511
00:121:34.958 --> 00:121:39.798
. And you know, Barbara mcclintock got the Nobel

1512
00:121:39.810 --> 00:121:45.159
Prize for showing it's very dynamic. Um So,

1513
00:121:45.168 --> 00:121:48.680
you know, if that is properly thought of as

1514
00:121:48.689 --> 00:121:54.918
an example of complementary computing, uh There are many

1515
00:121:54.930 --> 00:122:00.798
examples of this kind of complementarity uh throughout all of

1516
00:122:00.810 --> 00:122:04.378
life, um et cetera, et cetera, et

1517
00:122:04.390 --> 00:122:08.689
cetera. Uh And as I say, you know

1518
00:122:08.699 --> 00:122:12.798
, when, um so for example, some of

1519
00:122:12.810 --> 00:122:19.259
the competitive dynamics I discuss like mass action recurrent on

1520
00:122:19.270 --> 00:122:26.180
center off around networks competition uh is universal, not

1521
00:122:26.189 --> 00:122:29.770
only when you think of it on the species level

1522
00:122:29.958 --> 00:122:32.069
, a a Darwin, but it also occurs at

1523
00:122:32.079 --> 00:122:39.298
every level of cellular organization. Uh So the aggregation

1524
00:122:39.310 --> 00:122:44.628
of slime molds is an example of a competitive dynamic

1525
00:122:44.640 --> 00:122:49.029
with an on center of surround recurrent network. Uh

1526
00:122:49.259 --> 00:122:57.270
So there were these universal computational principles that are not

1527
00:122:57.279 --> 00:123:03.359
only about us that are also about all living things

1528
00:123:03.369 --> 00:123:08.699
. And you know, when I read theoretical physics

1529
00:123:08.708 --> 00:123:10.759
, which I've been doing since I was a boy

1530
00:123:11.680 --> 00:123:14.949
, you know, I see what I view as

1531
00:123:15.338 --> 00:123:20.548
physical versions of on center of surround networks galaxy as

1532
00:123:20.560 --> 00:123:26.588
it were, you know, it's a balance balancing

1533
00:123:26.600 --> 00:123:30.640
act, but I can't say anything useful about that

1534
00:123:30.850 --> 00:123:33.789
. So, uh let me just ask you one

1535
00:123:33.798 --> 00:123:36.390
last question then and I want to ask you this

1536
00:123:36.399 --> 00:123:41.109
because I also, I actually found it very interesting

1537
00:123:41.119 --> 00:123:44.168
that you talk about this in the book and whenever

1538
00:123:44.180 --> 00:123:47.779
people in science talk about laws many times, uh

1539
00:123:47.789 --> 00:123:51.279
I mean, people get upset about talking about laws

1540
00:123:51.289 --> 00:123:54.819
that are not laws of physics, I mean laws

1541
00:123:54.829 --> 00:123:57.890
of biology, psychology or whatever. I mean,

1542
00:123:57.899 --> 00:124:00.159
people are not usually very fond of that. But

1543
00:124:00.369 --> 00:124:03.770
do you think that we can actually talk about laws

1544
00:124:03.779 --> 00:124:15.470
of cell biology? Well, cell biology is vast

1545
00:124:15.168 --> 00:124:24.579
and these days he biology usually means genetics. And

1546
00:124:25.418 --> 00:124:28.159
uh I'm not a geneticist, although I did just

1547
00:124:28.168 --> 00:124:32.399
make a very speculative comment about the double helix.

1548
00:124:33.298 --> 00:124:39.850
Um So I'm not sure what context to put the

1549
00:124:39.859 --> 00:124:43.418
question, you know, it is part of cell

1550
00:124:43.430 --> 00:124:48.918
biology. What I said about um uh slime mold

1551
00:124:48.930 --> 00:124:55.100
aggregation, their cells, their biology, the growth

1552
00:124:55.109 --> 00:125:00.000
of hydrous heads, their cells. It's biology in

1553
00:125:00.009 --> 00:125:04.298
that sense, there are examples of shared laws,

1554
00:125:05.350 --> 00:125:11.970
um you know, gastro relation, it's cell biology

1555
00:125:11.989 --> 00:125:14.500
, it's not in a brain, there is no

1556
00:125:14.509 --> 00:125:20.409
brain yet. So um I feel, you know

1557
00:125:20.418 --> 00:125:25.279
, even my work has shown that what I'm doing

1558
00:125:25.289 --> 00:125:28.979
is a special case of more general laws that you

1559
00:125:28.989 --> 00:125:33.298
can see reflected in examples of cells in biology.

1560
00:125:33.310 --> 00:125:39.100
But um if you, if what you mean is

1561
00:125:40.079 --> 00:125:44.470
genetics, then I'm not a geneticist, but it

1562
00:125:44.479 --> 00:125:49.750
does strike me that the double helix. Uh and

1563
00:125:49.759 --> 00:125:53.529
for all I know it's being done, maybe the

1564
00:125:53.539 --> 00:125:57.890
stuff that Barbara mcclintock got started is maybe being studied

1565
00:125:58.628 --> 00:126:01.119
very actively and I just don't read about it in

1566
00:126:01.128 --> 00:126:08.739
terms of the dynamics of those complimentary strands. Um

1567
00:126:09.720 --> 00:126:14.168
you know, complementary computing generally gives you a form

1568
00:126:14.180 --> 00:126:16.668
of stability. You know, the Yin and the

1569
00:126:16.680 --> 00:126:24.250
Yang alone aren't enough but together and bound by the

1570
00:126:24.259 --> 00:126:28.020
right kind of feedback. They can give you stable

1571
00:126:28.029 --> 00:126:33.199
organization just like with the boundaries and surfaces, for

1572
00:126:33.208 --> 00:126:35.579
example, like with the water and West streams,

1573
00:126:36.289 --> 00:126:39.989
one of the great triumphs of the watch stream,

1574
00:126:40.798 --> 00:126:45.489
which I try to explain through models is how you

1575
00:126:45.500 --> 00:126:51.588
develop invariant recognition categories, size and variant view and

1576
00:126:51.600 --> 00:126:57.029
variant position variant. So I could recognize you from

1577
00:126:57.039 --> 00:127:02.168
any view, distance angle, you know. But

1578
00:127:02.180 --> 00:127:06.958
the problem with being position and variant is at the

1579
00:127:06.970 --> 00:127:12.180
place where you're computing this and the anterior of infra

1580
00:127:12.279 --> 00:127:15.810
temporal cortex, I have no idea where your face

1581
00:127:15.819 --> 00:127:20.350
is in space. And that's what the, so

1582
00:127:20.359 --> 00:127:24.439
that's in the W stream, the West stream gives

1583
00:127:24.449 --> 00:127:29.189
a spatial representation. So you have to be able

1584
00:127:29.199 --> 00:127:32.149
to go from an invariant representation into the watch stream

1585
00:127:33.189 --> 00:127:40.149
into a variant position representation in the West stream.

1586
00:127:40.548 --> 00:127:46.810
And I explain how that happens. Um uh But

1587
00:127:46.819 --> 00:127:50.949
by themselves, you know, you'd have positions without

1588
00:127:50.958 --> 00:127:55.199
objects and objects, you didn't know where they are

1589
00:127:55.668 --> 00:127:58.470
. So each of them is useful and important,

1590
00:127:59.180 --> 00:128:05.199
but it's not enough his survival. So complementary computing

1591
00:128:05.509 --> 00:128:09.359
on every level of our brains is necessary for survival

1592
00:128:09.329 --> 00:128:13.039
. And it may very well be uh at every

1593
00:128:13.048 --> 00:128:18.430
level of cell biology. But I'm not a person

1594
00:128:18.439 --> 00:128:22.909
who studied non brainin cell systems for long enough to

1595
00:128:22.918 --> 00:128:28.128
make a strong comment. I'd love to know more

1596
00:128:28.140 --> 00:128:28.838
about it. Maybe I'll do more of that.

1597
00:128:30.659 --> 00:128:31.970
Uh In my remaining years. I don't know.

1598
00:128:33.699 --> 00:128:37.319
Well, uh there are many other topics that of

1599
00:128:37.329 --> 00:128:41.359
course, we could cover here because the book is

1600
00:128:41.369 --> 00:128:45.680
massive and very detailed. And again, it is

1601
00:128:45.689 --> 00:128:48.810
the conscious mind resonant brain how, which brain makes

1602
00:128:48.819 --> 00:128:52.720
a mind and I'm leaving a link in the description

1603
00:128:52.729 --> 00:128:56.119
to it and I hope that my audience runs and

1604
00:128:56.128 --> 00:128:58.109
buys it. It's a very interesting book. And

1605
00:128:58.529 --> 00:129:00.909
uh Steve, apart from the book, would you

1606
00:129:00.918 --> 00:129:03.829
like to tell people where they can find you and

1607
00:129:03.838 --> 00:129:07.119
your work on the internet? Oh, yes.

1608
00:129:07.128 --> 00:129:09.079
So I had mentioned once, but let me say

1609
00:129:09.088 --> 00:129:13.668
again, I have a personal web page sites,

1610
00:129:13.680 --> 00:129:26.088
si tes dot bu.edu. So sites Boston University Education

1611
00:129:26.100 --> 00:129:35.168
slash Steve Gsteveg. Um uh All my articles can

1612
00:129:35.180 --> 00:129:39.350
be downloaded from there and quite a few interviews and

1613
00:129:39.020 --> 00:129:43.918
uh some videos of keynote lectures on different topics.

1614
00:129:45.649 --> 00:129:50.289
Um And if anyone wants to write me with a

1615
00:129:50.298 --> 00:129:54.708
question about my work, my email is simple.

1616
00:129:54.720 --> 00:130:03.009
It's just Steve Steve at bu.edu. Steve at bu.edu

1617
00:130:03.659 --> 00:130:07.520
. So I love to discuss science. And um

1618
00:130:09.229 --> 00:130:15.579
um what can I say? I started 67 years

1619
00:130:15.588 --> 00:130:20.298
ago and I'm still at it. And um and

1620
00:130:20.310 --> 00:130:22.298
that's a testimony and I only need to my good

1621
00:130:22.310 --> 00:130:28.119
luck but to really respect the foundations of what I

1622
00:130:28.128 --> 00:130:31.779
was studying and not go for shortcuts and they've thrust

1623
00:130:31.789 --> 00:130:35.739
me forward. So I never hit a brick wall

1624
00:130:35.689 --> 00:130:39.588
. And uh I've loved every minute of it even

1625
00:130:39.600 --> 00:130:43.918
though it's been really hard work. Well. And

1626
00:130:43.930 --> 00:130:46.930
uh thank you so much for that work and it's

1627
00:130:46.939 --> 00:130:50.890
been an immense pleasure to have you on the show

1628
00:130:50.899 --> 00:130:52.329
. Thank you so much for accepting the invitation.

1629
00:130:52.338 --> 00:130:56.449
Thank you for inviting me and I'll look forward to

1630

getting the URL for it so I can uh hope

1631
00:131:01.279 --> 00:131:07.009
I don't cringe too much. No, it was

1632
00:131:07.020 --> 00:131:07.810
great. It was great. So, thank you

1633
00:131:07.819 --> 00:131:13.039
