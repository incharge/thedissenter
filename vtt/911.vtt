00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.879
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.320
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:08.630
And today I'm joined by Doctor Caleb Everett, is

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.829
a senior associate in the College of Arts and Sciences

5
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.259
at the University of Miami and a professor in the

6
00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.739
anthropology department with the secondary appointment in psychology. And

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.129
today we're talking about his latest book, a Myriad

8
00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:26.010
of tongues. Our languages reveal differences in how we

9
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.609
think. So. Doctor Everett, welcome to the

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.269
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone. Well

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.429
, thanks for having me. It's great to be

12
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.539
here. So, as a linguist, uh and

13
00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:39.618
since the book is basically about linguistic diversity and our

14
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.079
languages are so diverse in many different kinds of aspects

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.668
and we'll get into some of those aspects. But

16
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.039
I would like to start by asking you, do

17
00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:53.139
you think that in linguistics, particularly nowadays, people

18
00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.840
still tend to assume too much universality in language?

19
00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:00.329
Yeah, I would say so. And that's one

20
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.259
of the cases made in the book and I'm not

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.980
the only one making that case to be clear these

22
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.000
days. Um There, there's been an assumption of

23
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.299
that. At least some features of languages are universal

24
00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:15.739
. And I think increasingly that argument is, is

25
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.019
harder to support. Basically, as linguists have done

26
00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:23.870
more research in different parts of the world um with

27
00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:26.558
different populations that are not western, educated, industrialized

28
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.829
, rich democracies, these so called weird societies.

29
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.760
And as the focus of linguistic research has been less

30
00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:38.418
European or indo-european, let's say, um I think

31
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.629
that the the evidence for universals in, in language

32
00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:46.329
are, are really uh harder and harder. The

33
00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.659
evidence is harder and harder to come by. There

34
00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:49.448
are still some who think that there are some core

35
00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.638
tenets of language that are universal. I'm not one

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.439
of those folks. Um There are some reasonable arguments

37
00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.349
, I just think it's harder and harder to support

38
00:01:57.778 --> 00:01:59.308
. And as I said, there are a number

39
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.269
of linguists that have been making this case now for

40
00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:04.540
a while and this book helps to synthesize some of

41
00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.229
the work of those scholars. But when it comes

42
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.580
to the differences, we find across languages, I

43
00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:15.058
mean, of course, this is a very broad

44
00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.088
question but where would you say those differences stem from

45
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.469
primarily? I mean, that's a good question.

46
00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.800
So some of the things relate to say, just

47
00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:29.838
the different usage of function of the functional usage of

48
00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.399
certain linguistic forms in certain contexts, right? So

49
00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.889
you can think of something like like my last book

50
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.508
was about numbers and number words and things like that

51
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.939
. And it's clear that there are pressures on cultures

52
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.778
in certain contexts to develop number words more than in

53
00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.758
other contexts, right? It's not that one is

54
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.169
better or worse. It's just that there are pressures

55
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.538
in certain contexts to develop certain features of certain linguistic

56
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.169
features. Some of it is a lot more analogous

57
00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.379
to what we might think of as genetic drift,

58
00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.588
right? Where it's just there are differences that crop

59
00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.960
up in populations. When you have thousands of populations

60
00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.879
living around the world, there are going to be

61
00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.599
certain differences in speech and in cultural norms that develop

62
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.139
that maybe have no like clear motivation, they just

63
00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.300
are differences, right? And that, that's a

64
00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:16.710
big part of you get these, you know,

65
00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.669
probabilistic tendencies across languages and then you and these are

66
00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.159
gonna just operate in different ways in different contexts.

67
00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.219
So those, those are part of the reasons for

68
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.199
the differences. Another potential reason for some of the

69
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.008
differences are uh environmental differences, right? So some

70
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.689
of this might be really obvious, like if you're

71
00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.719
, if you're a hunter gather group in Amazonia,

72
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.610
you might have a greater need to distinguish certain um

73
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.979
flora and fauna around you in more precise ways than

74
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.020
say I would, right. So, you know

75
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.099
, um for instance, some of the people that

76
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.308
I've worked with in, in the Amazon, um

77
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.750
the Kiana, they have a variety of different words

78
00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:59.099
for, for monkey species. Um But there's no

79
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.929
like sort of super ordinate term of monkey because that's

80
00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.990
less of a useful feet, like it's very important

81
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.169
for them to break things down into the individual.

82
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.058
Whereas for, for me, even though I know

83
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.729
there are lots of terms for these species in English

84
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.610
, I don't know them. Right. So I

85
00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:15.288
call a lot of, I have like a few

86
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.790
different terms for monkey. Now, that's something that's

87
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.608
clearly impacted in one way or another by the environment

88
00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:23.170
. So you get this collage of motivations for why

89
00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:25.160
languages differ, those, those are a few of

90
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.548
them anyway. And another one of those reasons has

91
00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.170
to do with uh people's specific social needs. Correct

92
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.809
? Yeah. So social units, so like the

93
00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.879
kind of um kinship terms that they have, you

94
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.730
know, this, this, this reflects, you

95
00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:45.410
know, critical differences in, in terms of how

96
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.410
the social units are constructed within societies. There's some

97
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.838
research suggesting that um you know, languages spoken by

98
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.629
larger populations have some differences, some tendencies in contrast

99
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.439
to languages spoken by very small populations. Um That's

100
00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.178
something that's hotly debated amongst linguists and amongst other cognitive

101
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.399
scientists. But yeah, there do seem to be

102
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.678
, there is some evidence that um varying social pressures

103
00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.230
across groups impact how languages evolve. So let's get

104
00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:20.309
into a few concrete examples here in the book,

105
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:25.410
you talk about time, for example. So what

106
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.059
do we know about how people think about time and

107
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:34.048
what relationship does that have with uh language? Yeah

108
00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.569
, that's a really good question. So when you

109
00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:39.149
, when I I mean, I'll give you an

110
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.949
anecdote, like when I, when I teach um

111
00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:43.470
a linguistics course here at the University of Miami,

112
00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:46.608
and I ask students how you think about time and

113
00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.269
they'll, they'll often start talking about past, present

114
00:05:49.278 --> 00:05:51.879
and future as though these are sort of, you

115
00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.178
know, immutable categories that exist. And obviously,

116
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.199
in some ways, we all experience time. You

117
00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:58.910
know, the claim in the book is not that

118
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.028
the language you speak totally changes your perception of time

119
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.959
passing itself. But it comes as a surprise to

120
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.160
some students, to most students that many languages don't

121
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.709
have three tenses. You know, many languages have

122
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.480
only two tenses, some languages have no tenses,

123
00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:17.778
some languages have as many as seven tenses. And

124
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.649
so this this reflects the fact that that how we

125
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.600
delineate time linguistically can vary sometimes more than people realize

126
00:06:28.608 --> 00:06:30.100
, right, whether that has any effect on how

127
00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:33.000
people think about time when it comes to tense less

128
00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.230
clear. Um But there are some other examples of

129
00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:39.699
the way that we talk about time that seem to

130
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.209
indicate that there are these associated differences in how people

131
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.579
think about time. So the common metaphor of the

132
00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:49.480
the past being behind you and the future being in

133
00:06:49.488 --> 00:06:53.009
front of you. That's not something that we have

134
00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:55.269
in English and that exists in a number of languages

135
00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.829
around the world. That's not a metaphor that exists

136
00:06:57.838 --> 00:06:59.500
in all the world's languages, right? So in

137
00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:00.720
many languages, some talked about in the book,

138
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.519
you talk about the past as though it is in

139
00:07:03.528 --> 00:07:05.639
front of you. And the future is though it's

140
00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:10.319
behind you. And researchers that have, have studied

141
00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.869
these groups have shown, for instance that when they're

142
00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.970
talking about the past, they oftentimes point in front

143
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.399
of themselves, right? Whereas in English, when

144
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.449
we talk about the past, we tend to point

145
00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:23.988
backwards, right? So this seems to reflect these

146
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.949
gestures seem to reflect some wider cognitive processes that are

147
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:30.639
, that are sort of being indicated by the the

148
00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:33.160
metaphors that we use. Or you could say that

149
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.048
the metaphors themselves are somehow impacting how we think about

150
00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:41.000
the passing of time. One of the really fascinating

151
00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:44.379
examples in the book is from a group of people

152
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.699
called the Eno in New Guinea. And this is

153
00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:50.059
research done by other folks at the University of California

154
00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:54.579
, San Diego and other places showing that in that

155
00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:56.858
language, they tend to talk about the time is

156
00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:00.100
flowing uphill, you know, so whether you point

157
00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:03.689
in front of you or behind you depends on which

158
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.178
way you're facing on a hill at the time that

159
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:07.189
you're talking. And you can imagine that if you're

160
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.920
trying to learn that language, as you say,

161
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:11.069
an anthropological linguist, trying to figure that out,

162
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:13.178
it must be really tricky to figure that out,

163
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:16.230
right? But then you talk to someone who speaks

164
00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:18.579
a language like that and it might seem very natural

165
00:08:18.588 --> 00:08:20.750
to them. I think that's one of the interesting

166
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.850
things is that these ways of talking about time and

167
00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:26.540
gesturing about time come to seem very natural as though

168
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.369
it's like just the default human experience. When in

169
00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:33.298
reality it clearly isn't. There's some, there's more

170
00:08:33.308 --> 00:08:37.428
variability there than, than people often realize. So

171
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.139
, since you've done work on numbers does the way

172
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:43.710
we talk about time connect in any way to the

173
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:46.428
way we talk about numbers. I I'm asking you

174
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.989
that also because I mean, at least in more

175
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.690
Western languages, I, I'm not sure about the

176
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.070
universality of this or not, but we tend also

177
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.229
to subdivide time in terms of hours, minutes,

178
00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:05.320
seconds, I mean, count basically the passage of

179
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.960
time in that way. So uh is there some

180
00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:11.729
connection there? Yeah, I think so. I

181
00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:13.918
mean, I think it's, it's almost hard to

182
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.320
overstate what a difference that makes, right? So

183
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.918
if you talk about, um there was some research

184
00:09:18.928 --> 00:09:20.099
done with an Amazonian group about 10 years ago.

185
00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:22.879
The Tupi kawa is the name of the language anyway

186
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.928
. And this is not that far from where I've

187
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.058
done some of my research in the Amazon. And

188
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.558
there's not any evidence that they talk about time and

189
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.639
hardly at all right. There's really not much concrete

190
00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:37.658
evidence of that and they don't seem to use the

191
00:09:37.668 --> 00:09:39.899
metaphors for time, any of the metaphors that I

192
00:09:39.908 --> 00:09:41.158
just mentioned, like future being in front of you

193
00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:45.538
past being behind you. So you can imagine that

194
00:09:45.548 --> 00:09:48.080
in a group like that when there aren't many words

195
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.009
that are associated with things related to time, of

196
00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.340
course, that doesn't mean people aren't experiencing time in

197
00:09:52.349 --> 00:09:54.158
that group. But the point is that they don't

198
00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:56.779
have words for things like week or month or,

199
00:09:56.788 --> 00:10:01.629
or, um, season perhaps. But in a

200
00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:03.080
context like that, you can think about how foreign

201
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.884
, something like hours and minutes and seconds seconds are

202
00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:11.264
, right. And these sort of linguistic units pretty

203
00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:13.594
much govern our lives, right? Like everything about

204
00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:16.404
our lives is constrained by hours and minutes and seconds

205
00:10:16.774 --> 00:10:18.154
. And if you think about the origins of these

206
00:10:18.163 --> 00:10:22.413
terms, they're very much related to the numerical systems

207
00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:24.894
of other languages, some of which are now extinct

208
00:10:24.904 --> 00:10:26.514
, right? So if you the base 60 system

209
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.090
, you know, 60 minutes, 60 seconds that

210
00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:33.460
comes from really can be traced back to Ancient Mesopotamia

211
00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:37.399
where there was a base 60 number system. And

212
00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.580
then that influenced the tracking of time in different places

213
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.908
, including Ancient Greece and then made its way into

214
00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:46.619
Europe, right? Um, in terms of 12

215
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:50.269
hours, that's something that goes back to Egyptian sun

216
00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:52.109
dials thousands of years ago where they had 10 units

217
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.229
for the sun dial for dividing the day up and

218
00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.840
then they added a unit for dawn and a unit

219
00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:00.759
for dusk. You know, when the light,

220
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:01.979
when the sun's not completely up, but it's light

221
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:05.269
out and then, so that's how you get 12

222
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.719
, right? And then if you do that at

223
00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:09.989
night too, eventually we had the people had the

224
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.509
idea to divide the night up into equal units also

225
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.580
. So you can see how you go when you

226
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.590
count hours and minutes, you're going from something that's

227
00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:24.070
influenced by Ancient Egyptian sundials to ancient Mesopotamian number systems

228
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.879
to then the decimal number system that we all take

229
00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:30.139
for granted. So you're kind of as you tell

230
00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:31.389
time, you're kind of taking a trip through time

231
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:35.729
through these different eras. And so this is kind

232
00:11:35.739 --> 00:11:37.940
of all this cultural residue that has been, you

233
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.200
know, acquired in our, in our uh tracking

234
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.090
of time. But we learn it, we take

235
00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:46.210
it for granted and obviously, it affects how we

236
00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:48.379
think in some level because we're constantly thinking about hours

237
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:52.139
and minutes and seconds and how much longer do we

238
00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:54.320
have before the next meeting or whatever? It very

239
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.928
much governs our lives. So, so, yeah

240
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.259
, I think it's, it's fair to say that

241
00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:01.798
there's some influence of thought uh based on our number

242
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:05.460
systems on how we think about time. Uh So

243
00:12:05.469 --> 00:12:07.649
when it comes to numbers, uh if what I'm

244
00:12:07.658 --> 00:12:11.558
about to say is outdated, please correct me.

245
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.479
But uh I read some time ago that at least

246
00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:18.979
in more traditional societies like hunter gatherers, horticulturalists and

247
00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:22.340
so on that when it comes to counting, people

248
00:12:22.349 --> 00:12:26.619
usually count up to three, sometimes five and then

249
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:31.038
they just use words like our terms like, uh

250
00:12:31.048 --> 00:12:33.548
, a few, many a lot. And so

251
00:12:33.558 --> 00:12:39.639
it's just in societies where we have really formal schooling

252
00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:43.489
that we count beyond, beyond three or five.

253
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.739
I mean, is that true? I mean,

254
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.879
yeah, that's, that's not an inaccurate generalization.

255
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:50.413
I mean, it's definitely a general, there are

256
00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:52.375
exceptions. Right. There are plenty of, um

257
00:12:52.384 --> 00:12:54.663
, hunter gatherer groups, especially one of the things

258
00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.413
about number systems is they spread very quickly, right

259
00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:58.825
? Like people tend to see how useful they are

260
00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:01.933
or they have economic pressures to get to know numbers

261
00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:05.404
so that they're not taken advantage of. And so

262
00:13:05.413 --> 00:13:07.744
they can sort of spread like this cognitive fire.

263
00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:09.634
But it is true that there are some very simple

264
00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:13.394
number systems in hunter gatherer groups where there doesn't seem

265
00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:16.404
to be a lot of usefulness maybe to number systems

266
00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:20.070
in ways that there might be for us. And

267
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.969
obviously, it's not because these people are incapable of

268
00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:22.918
learning numbers. It's just that they haven't developed in

269
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:26.940
their society. A famous case is, um the

270
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.070
PETA Ha in the Amazon. This is a group

271
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.619
I've spent some time with the work of my father

272
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:35.058
made this group famous. Um, but they have

273
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.259
basically no numbers at all, no precise numbers.

274
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:43.109
And some cognitive scientists um went from Berkeley and mit

275
00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:45.879
went down there and sort of helped demonstrate this experimentally

276
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.139
. So that's one that's an extreme case. There

277
00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:50.418
seemed to be maybe a couple of cases like that

278
00:13:50.428 --> 00:13:52.908
worldwide where there's no precise number of words at all

279
00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:54.820
in a group. What's more common is what you're

280
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.399
talking about a, a 12 mini system or a

281
00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:03.928
123 mini system or some groups that do have elaborate

282
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.190
number systems, but maybe they're just not used as

283
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.779
frequently. So, um I worked with this one

284
00:14:09.788 --> 00:14:11.788
group but this was over 10 years ago. Um

285
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.279
that had number words that it was thought that they

286
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:16.479
didn't have number words when I did some experiments with

287
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.119
them, it was clear that they do have number

288
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:22.330
words, but it wasn't clear how many people in

289
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.399
the culture knew them. Right. So, some

290
00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:26.119
of the, some of the older men that I

291
00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.139
talked to seem to know the number system that they

292
00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:30.769
had used when, when hunting or talking about how

293
00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:31.379
long they were going to be gone on a hunting

294
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:35.450
trip. But I think that's another factor is how

295
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.830
, how, how diffuse are the numbers within a

296
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.840
society for, for societies like ours because you're sort

297
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:43.279
of, they're inculcated in us from a really young

298
00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:46.969
age, like you're just taught numbers. And again

299
00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:48.149
, it's another thing that just comes to seem to

300
00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:50.889
be like a default way of how the world works

301
00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:52.989
. And we don't realize that these are actually sort

302
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.048
of culturally specific things that we're acquiring as, as

303
00:14:58.058 --> 00:15:01.840
we're raised in a numerate culture. Mhm. So

304
00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:05.009
, we've sort of already made reference to this.

305
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:07.029
But, uh, when we talked about, for

306
00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:11.219
example, how certain people tend to think about,

307
00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:13.308
uh, time, uh, uh, uh,

308
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.440
if we're talking about the past back then or in

309
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.950
front of them or something like that. So there's

310
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.500
already somewhat of a rela, uh, of a

311
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:26.349
relationship between time and space there. But looking across

312
00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:30.190
languages, I mean, how much really is there

313
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.239
of a relationship between how we talk about time and

314
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.399
how we talk about space? I mean, that's

315
00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:39.830
a really good question. Um Another thing that's been

316
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.918
debated, but it's pretty clear that cultures in general

317
00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:46.979
make use of space to talk about time, right

318
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:48.969
? Time is this really abstract thing, we can't

319
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:50.149
reach out and touch it. It's not like around

320
00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:54.340
us. And so mapping time onto space, which

321
00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:56.580
is more concrete and we can talk about it as

322
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.779
being in front of us or it helps us make

323
00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:02.399
sense of this very nebulous thing of the passing of

324
00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:03.918
time, right? Even as I say that I'm

325
00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:06.399
saying, the passing of time and obviously that's a

326
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:08.389
spatial thing too, like time is not really passing

327
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:12.330
. And so there have been some suggestions that every

328
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.710
culture, they may talk about time in terms of

329
00:16:17.719 --> 00:16:19.259
space in different ways, like the examples I gave

330
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.450
before. But every culture talks about time in terms

331
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.369
of space somehow. But there again that there's been

332
00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:30.450
suggestions that that is not a universal, it's just

333
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.200
a tendency because we seem to, for everything that

334
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.969
we say, oh, this is a universal of

335
00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:37.229
how people talk. Inevitably someone will come back and

336
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:40.960
say now I've been working with this group for,

337
00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:41.619
you know, 10 years and I swear they don't

338
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:44.798
do that. You know, it's like, it's

339
00:16:44.808 --> 00:16:47.080
more of a sampling problem than anything. There,

340
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.099
there could be that certainly does seem to be a

341
00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:52.190
very strong tendency though, across human populations. People

342
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.558
like to make sense of time in terms of space

343
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.369
. Another very interesting thing related to space is how

344
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:03.808
we use directions. Like for example, we in

345
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.739
our western languages tend to use left and right.

346
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.259
But there are other languages where people actually use cardinal

347
00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:15.338
orientations like east and west. So do we know

348
00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:19.779
exactly why there are those differences? I mean,

349
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.279
that's a good, that's another great question. I

350
00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:25.509
think in terms of why the differences exist, it's

351
00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:26.390
, it's always easy to debate, right? We

352
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.420
can come up with different ideas like, so what

353
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.828
you're talking about in terms of egocentric directions, right

354
00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:37.029
, based on the body, like left versus right

355
00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:40.219
, these very common worldwide. And it's another thing

356
00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:41.880
that at some point people said, well, this

357
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.469
is just a universal humans think about space in terms

358
00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:47.868
of centered around their body. And so they're always

359
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.910
going to describe things as being, they're going to

360
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.459
use some egocentric system. It may not be left

361
00:17:52.469 --> 00:17:53.529
versus right, but it's going to be something like

362
00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.848
that. And then inevitably, it turns out there

363
00:17:56.858 --> 00:17:59.170
are plenty of groups that don't do that. So

364
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.890
some of them are more geocentric which, you know

365
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.469
, centered around features of the earth or this could

366
00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:07.209
be something like, you know, like you said

367
00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:10.858
, cardinal directions like east versus west, north versus

368
00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:11.608
south. And then it turns out there are plenty

369
00:18:11.618 --> 00:18:15.049
of groups where it might not exactly be those directions

370
00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:18.229
, but the way that they give spatial reference,

371
00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:19.890
the way that they talk about spatial references or give

372
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.000
directions tend to be geocentric. It's not left versus

373
00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:26.189
right, it's not centered on the human body.

374
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:32.108
And so there the differences in spatial uh terminology and

375
00:18:32.118 --> 00:18:34.779
how people refer to the space around themselves turns out

376
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:37.969
are much greater than people once thought back in the

377
00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:41.989
say seventies and eighties. And basically, since the

378
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.189
nineties, there's been increasing research showing that people think

379
00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:48.029
about space and really diverse ways now why those differences

380
00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:52.180
exist? That's, you know, we can debate

381
00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:52.828
how much of that is just like what I said

382
00:18:52.838 --> 00:18:56.410
earlier, something analogous to genetic drift where it's just

383
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.719
like people are going to do things differently in different

384
00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:00.549
contexts. They just, I think there are some

385
00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.459
some ways of talking about space that are clearly more

386
00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:07.910
likely to develop in certain areas. So like things

387
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.019
that are centered around the sun, right? Or

388
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:12.979
where are probably more like there's going to be some

389
00:19:12.989 --> 00:19:17.229
bias towards like equatorial sunny regions, right? Where

390
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.930
east tends to be in a clear direction and west

391
00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:22.449
tends to be in the clear direction. You can

392
00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:25.539
imagine why that might be less likely to develop in

393
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:27.618
high latitudes or something like that where east and west

394
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:33.068
aren't so, so obvious. Um But you know

395
00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:36.539
, these, these environmental effects seem to be subtle

396
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:37.828
and they're not deterministic, like we can't just say

397
00:19:37.838 --> 00:19:40.969
, oh, this, this language is spoken here

398
00:19:41.019 --> 00:19:42.890
and so the people probably talk about space this way

399
00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.559
, right? Um There are a number of cultures

400
00:19:45.568 --> 00:19:49.309
though where they talk about directions in terms of uphill

401
00:19:49.318 --> 00:19:52.930
or downhill, you know, in a certain plane

402
00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:55.519
. And it's not necessarily the immediate hill that they're

403
00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:59.229
on, but it's the general trajectory of the geography

404
00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:02.858
and the surrounding terrain. And obviously, you wouldn't

405
00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.930
develop a system like that if you just live in

406
00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:07.650
the plains of North America or something like that where

407
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.368
there aren't a lot of hills like that, that's

408
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.068
pretty clear that there's some environmental influence. How much

409
00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:17.289
is a matter of, of debate. So we

410
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.900
earlier, we've already touched a little bit on how

411
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:25.660
languages also influence in a way how we understand and

412
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:30.598
talk about social relationships. And you mentioned kinship systems

413
00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:33.618
, for example, but it also applies to things

414
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.868
like social groups and classes, race, ethnicity,

415
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.019
gender and so on. Yeah. Yeah, it

416
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:44.910
, it relates to everything. And so some of

417
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.338
the terms, I mean, gender is a good

418
00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:49.680
one, right? Where there are some languages that

419
00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:52.598
have maybe a, a term for a generic third

420
00:20:52.608 --> 00:20:56.680
gender and a lot of languages. It's just binary

421
00:20:56.098 --> 00:20:59.358
. Um in terms of kinship, there, I

422
00:20:59.368 --> 00:21:00.049
go into a few of these things in the books

423
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:03.539
, but there are entire volumes dedicated to differences in

424
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:06.338
kinship terms because they can be very extreme, right

425
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.529
? So whether or not um like one feature that

426
00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:11.858
I think is interesting because I've come across it in

427
00:21:11.868 --> 00:21:15.160
some of my own work is age differences in kinship

428
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.390
, right? So in the example of the Carico

429
00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:21.430
, where you have differences between that brother and sister

430
00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:22.489
, there's no term, just brother or sister,

431
00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:26.118
the the term sister, like there's a term for

432
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.309
older sister, there's a term for younger sister,

433
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.650
but you're always kind of referencing your age and relationship

434
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.029
to the people around you in your kinship network.

435
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.098
And that kind of, you know, reciprocity of

436
00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:41.509
reference to age is something that we're not that familiar

437
00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:42.098
with. It can feel a little bit strange,

438
00:21:42.108 --> 00:21:44.519
but, you know, after you spend enough time

439
00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:45.539
talking to people like that, that these are clearly

440
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:49.588
very important aspects of their, of their kinship system

441
00:21:49.729 --> 00:21:52.848
. And so I think that's kind of the interesting

442
00:21:52.858 --> 00:21:56.729
thing is that people have different kinship systems, they

443
00:21:56.739 --> 00:22:00.939
have very different terms for the different, you know

444
00:22:00.949 --> 00:22:03.108
, nodes within that kinship system. And then this

445
00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:07.088
kind of reinforces certain way of thinking about relationships.

446
00:22:07.729 --> 00:22:11.410
Mhm. Uh In the book, you also get

447
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.430
a little bit into how we talk about colors and

448
00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:21.259
smells and uh how that influences how we remember visual

449
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:23.380
and olfactory stimuli. So, could you tell us

450
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.229
a bit about that? Yeah. So this is

451
00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:30.868
research that goes back decades now. Um It's,

452
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.009
it's been evolving over the last few decades, let's

453
00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:34.818
say. So. Um there, there have been

454
00:22:34.828 --> 00:22:38.959
these surveys done starting with color terms. Um uh

455
00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:41.640
Berlin and k these two scholars, they did this

456
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.809
, they did this influential book um over, I

457
00:22:45.818 --> 00:22:48.519
guess it's been about 50 years now and they demonstrating

458
00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:51.670
the differences in color terms across a lot of the

459
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.078
world's languages. And the basic way that this works

460
00:22:55.088 --> 00:22:59.680
is um researchers in different places give uh paint chips

461
00:22:59.689 --> 00:23:02.519
, color chips to different groups and have them name

462
00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:03.459
them, you know, a whole array of different

463
00:23:03.469 --> 00:23:07.189
hues and see where do they break up color terms

464
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:08.759
? Are there differences across languages in terms of how

465
00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:11.809
the hues are broken up? And it turns out

466
00:23:11.818 --> 00:23:14.019
there are actually a lot of differences and there are

467
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:17.140
a lot of differences in terms of the number of

468
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.390
terms that, that uh languages have so called basic

469
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.479
color words. There are some suggestions that some languages

470
00:23:25.489 --> 00:23:27.318
don't really have basic color words. But setting that

471
00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:30.680
aside, most languages have somewhere between three and 11

472
00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:33.910
, basic color terms. So there's a lot of

473
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.618
variation, but then there still are some tendencies,

474
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.838
which is really maybe not too surprising because we all

475
00:23:37.848 --> 00:23:41.000
have the same visual apparatus, we're all seeing the

476
00:23:41.009 --> 00:23:44.588
world in, in roughly the same way. However

477
00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:45.608
, there is some evidence that the some of the

478
00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:51.479
languages color term distinctions impact in subtle ways how people

479
00:23:51.588 --> 00:23:52.818
think about colors, or at least how they group

480
00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:56.430
them in certain cognitive tasks and their, their capacity

481
00:23:56.439 --> 00:24:00.420
to recall certain color terms. So if you,

482
00:24:00.858 --> 00:24:03.430
if your language makes, it makes a color term

483
00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:06.430
distinction between blue and green, for instance, which

484
00:24:07.189 --> 00:24:11.568
many languages do not. Um There's evidence that when

485
00:24:11.578 --> 00:24:15.519
you perceive um colors stimuli that that are on different

486
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:18.239
sides of that border blue versus green, you're more

487
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.439
likely to recall that difference in some experimental tasks,

488
00:24:22.449 --> 00:24:25.920
right? So no one makes the claim that like

489
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.059
these are huge differences, right? A lot of

490
00:24:27.068 --> 00:24:30.539
these things can get distorted, these are probably fairly

491
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:33.680
minor differences. Um but it's still interesting, right

492
00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:37.118
? Because it suggests that the language that you speak

493
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.078
impacts in subtle ways how you perform on certain visual

494
00:24:40.088 --> 00:24:44.088
tasks, right? Uh But uh I mean,

495
00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:48.750
that's about basically recalling certain callers and smells, for

496
00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:52.930
example, but do, do we know if language

497
00:24:52.939 --> 00:24:57.568
actually influences what people see and smell? Is that

498
00:24:57.578 --> 00:25:00.130
something that happens or not? I mean, there

499
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.439
is some research on this, I I don't how

500
00:25:03.449 --> 00:25:06.900
they see and how they smell is maybe too strongly

501
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.559
worded, but I do think some of the results

502
00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:11.189
are surprising, right? So that there's some evidence

503
00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:15.809
that like being presented with um verbal stimuli impacts the

504
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:18.479
likelihood that you're going to discriminate certain colors in a

505
00:25:18.489 --> 00:25:23.039
visual task, right? Um So, and you

506
00:25:23.049 --> 00:25:25.709
know, and then obviously, if your language doesn't

507
00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:27.519
have those words as verbal stimuli, maybe that affects

508
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:30.219
how you do in certain visual tasks. But I

509
00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.650
, and, and there, by the way,

510
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.920
there is a bunch of research now coming out suggesting

511
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.269
that words for smells vary more radically across cultures than

512
00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:41.959
we once thought. And that some cultures have abstract

513
00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:45.719
odor terms that are more analogous to our abstract color

514
00:25:45.729 --> 00:25:47.358
terms. You know, for instance, in English

515
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.328
instance in English, we don't really have abstract odor

516
00:25:49.338 --> 00:25:52.000
terms to the extent that some of these other languages

517
00:25:52.009 --> 00:25:56.880
now seem we we're seeing that they do have whether

518
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.799
that actually impacts how you smell, you know,

519
00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:02.959
that's a different question, but there's some evidence.

520
00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:06.088
But I would say that it's that the, you

521
00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:07.309
know, it's not like huge. I I never

522
00:26:07.318 --> 00:26:10.500
want to give like when I'm talking about this stuff

523
00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:11.098
in class, I never want to give students the

524
00:26:11.108 --> 00:26:15.890
impression that like it just changes how you see completely

525
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.729
. I think that kind of view was romanticized way

526
00:26:18.739 --> 00:26:22.140
too much and it as a result, it made

527
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.420
some um scholars more skeptical of any differences, right

528
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.338
, that there's any differences in thought based on language

529
00:26:30.348 --> 00:26:33.809
and the the claims these days are more subtle than

530
00:26:33.818 --> 00:26:34.670
that. Yeah, but yes, there, there

531
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.348
do seem to be some effects. It's just the

532
00:26:37.358 --> 00:26:41.670
size of those effects is, is debatable. Yeah

533
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:41.858
, I, I ask you, I asked you

534
00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:45.289
that because actually, I mean, perhaps a while

535
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:48.660
ago there was a period of time where certain people

536
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:55.243
were claiming or almost claiming. Actually that perhaps the

537
00:26:55.255 --> 00:26:57.765
way we talk, the words we used to refer

538
00:26:57.775 --> 00:27:03.443
to colors, actually, it changed our visual system

539
00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:07.564
when it came to how we process colors and we

540
00:27:07.574 --> 00:27:11.233
would be able to identify some and completely miss others

541
00:27:11.243 --> 00:27:15.074
or something like that. But perhaps that's too strong

542
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:15.930
, it might be too strong. But I,

543
00:27:15.939 --> 00:27:18.039
I don't wanna, I don't wanna be dismissive of

544
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:19.939
all that work either because I do think there's some

545
00:27:19.949 --> 00:27:23.519
really careful experimental work showing. So I'll give you

546
00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:26.279
an example of a study. I don't know if

547
00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:26.719
I talk about this in this book, but like

548
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:30.519
, you know, research showing that people are better

549
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:33.890
at discriminating certain colors presented to the right visual field

550
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.539
, which is processed by the left hemisphere where most

551
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:41.049
of our language processing typically happens. And they show

552
00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:45.209
that the color discrimination differs for the right visual field

553
00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:48.769
depending on the color terms that you have in your

554
00:27:48.779 --> 00:27:49.818
language, right? So that is an example of

555
00:27:49.828 --> 00:27:53.380
sort of an effect on how people are actually immediately

556
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.170
discriminating colors, right? So that's so I,

557
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.670
I don't want to give the impression that there's no

558
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.880
evidence for any of this stuff. It's just sometimes

559
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:03.890
people get the sense that like, oh you just

560
00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:07.489
in the popular media, maybe the the uptake of

561
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.739
some of that work sometimes is just oversimplified to the

562
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.989
point that it seems like if you don't speak a

563
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.828
language with green and blue distinctions, you're really just

564
00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:21.299
not gonna, everything's just gonna be collapsed visually and

565
00:28:21.309 --> 00:28:22.410
that's not what the research suggests, but there do

566
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.549
seem to be some effects. So earlier, we've

567
00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:32.838
also mentioned briefly how the physical environment can influence our

568
00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:36.338
particular languages evolve. And in the book, you

569
00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:41.239
go through the example of extreme ambient aridity. So

570
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.259
ho how does that particular kind of environment influence our

571
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:51.729
languages or particular languages have evolved? Um Yeah,

572
00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:53.098
that's a, that's probably of the research I've done

573
00:28:53.108 --> 00:28:56.160
. That's the most hotly contested research, right?

574
00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.269
Because um whenever you suggest environmental influences on language,

575
00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:03.170
it turns out there's there's some things that make people

576
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.920
uncomfortable about that, I think. Um but I

577
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.299
would argue that that's actually almost a boring thing,

578
00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:14.049
right? Like where there's plenty of research in the

579
00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:18.259
lab showing that really dry air affects how the vocal

580
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:21.689
cords operate, right? That's not controversial. That's

581
00:29:21.699 --> 00:29:23.318
in fact well established and you kind of know this

582
00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.479
from personal experience, right? Like even if you

583
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:27.380
spend a couple of days in the desert, not

584
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.949
drinking too much, um you can sort of see

585
00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:33.150
effects on your vocal cords. Now, the question

586
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.509
is, does that kind of thing impact how languages

587
00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:37.670
evolve? And so I had this paper with um

588
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.479
uh two colleagues of mine, uh Damian Blasi and

589
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:44.809
Sean Roberts. This was quite a while now ago

590
00:29:44.818 --> 00:29:45.759
now um in the proceedings of the National Academy of

591
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:49.549
Sciences, and we suggested that in really dry places

592
00:29:49.848 --> 00:29:55.380
, um complex tones which require precision of the vocal

593
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.920
cords might be less likely to evolve. This was

594
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.848
one of those things that got caught by the media

595
00:30:00.858 --> 00:30:03.318
and I would say really oversimplified by the media.

596
00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:06.039
And so it, it created, that was part

597
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:07.660
of what created some of the headaches, right?

598
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.019
Was that people they the uptake seemed to be that

599
00:30:11.588 --> 00:30:15.890
we were suggesting that wherever the language is spoken,

600
00:30:15.229 --> 00:30:18.789
you could predict whether it's tonal or not. And

601
00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:22.088
we weren't even suggesting a broad association between humidity and

602
00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:25.250
, and complex tones. We were just saying,

603
00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:29.170
hey, in really dry places, maybe it's less

604
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.368
likely that they would evolve, given this research in

605
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.900
the lab on how the vocal cords work. And

606
00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:38.199
then we showed a lot of data cross linguistically across

607
00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:41.930
the thousands of languages that seem consistent with that,

608
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.650
but it's ultimately correlational. So you can debate it

609
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.930
whether or not that's actually, and it's been hotly

610
00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:49.358
debated since then. Basically, there was, I

611
00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:52.848
should say a really cool study um by some Chinese

612
00:30:52.858 --> 00:30:56.410
scholars this year after my book was already off to

613
00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.088
press that offered, I think even better evidence for

614
00:31:00.098 --> 00:31:03.890
this than we did. Because one of the things

615
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.568
they these Chinese scholars did was they looked at a

616
00:31:06.578 --> 00:31:11.318
million actual audio files um by people that these audio

617
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:14.219
files were recorded all over China. And what they

618
00:31:14.229 --> 00:31:17.598
found was that in really dry places, you can

619
00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:19.890
see even in natural speech outside the lab that there's

620
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.068
an effect of dry air on the precision with which

621
00:31:23.078 --> 00:31:26.630
the vocal cords vibrate. So that doesn't mean that

622
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.029
we were definitely on the right track, but it's

623
00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:30.939
suggestive that, you know, at least in that

624
00:31:30.949 --> 00:31:33.420
case, there does seem to be ambient influence on

625
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.529
how the vocal cords operate which again, and I

626
00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:40.598
don't find that uh particularly shocking or surprising, but

627
00:31:40.699 --> 00:31:41.309
it uh I have to be honest and say it's

628
00:31:41.318 --> 00:31:45.250
still very hotly debated, you know, when it

629
00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:48.049
comes to en environment to the influence of the environment

630
00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:49.140
. One thing that I got across a few years

631
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.739
ago that really fascinated me was uh the existence of

632
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.199
whistled languages, like for example, in Greece,

633
00:31:57.209 --> 00:32:01.108
in mountainous places, there are uh a few communities

634
00:32:01.118 --> 00:32:06.035
where people in instead of really actually talking, they

635
00:32:06.045 --> 00:32:07.983
whistle to one another because I mean, they are

636
00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:12.723
very far apart because of the mountainous terrain and all

637
00:32:12.733 --> 00:32:14.904
of that. And so it's easier for them to

638
00:32:14.914 --> 00:32:20.035
convey information by whistling than by just talking to each

639
00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:24.473
other. And uh there are actual whistled languages or

640
00:32:24.483 --> 00:32:29.250
whistled versions of languages. Yeah, there are.

641
00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:30.358
And you, you're, you're absolutely right that they

642
00:32:30.368 --> 00:32:32.630
tend to be. There are some in some dense

643
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.868
jungle regions in, in Amazonia even. But there

644
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.588
is this tendency for them to be in mountainous terrain

645
00:32:39.598 --> 00:32:43.219
in Turkey, in Greece, in, um,

646
00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:47.670
Canary Islands in Central America. And so one plausible

647
00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.779
interpretation is the one that you just gave, right

648
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:52.328
, you can see people at great distances in these

649
00:32:52.338 --> 00:32:55.289
places, but you can't really communicate in the absence

650
00:32:55.299 --> 00:33:00.279
of these whistled frequencies that allow you to communicate.

651
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:01.449
Right. That's a clear and I think that's less

652
00:33:01.459 --> 00:33:05.380
controversial. However, it also gets at what's tricky

653
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.318
about some of these hypotheses, which is that at

654
00:33:07.328 --> 00:33:09.108
the end of the day, it's a very small

655
00:33:09.118 --> 00:33:13.630
number of data points. So it's hard to say

656
00:33:14.108 --> 00:33:15.618
, to establish definitively that that's why, you know

657
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.759
, because there are always exceptions, languages that are

658
00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:22.180
spoken in the dense Amazon or something like that and

659
00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:24.769
aren't in the same places. But yeah, I

660
00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:30.279
think it's totally reasonable interpretation. So another thing that

661
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:31.410
, that I would like to ask you about here

662
00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.170
is do you think that there might be some issues

663
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.219
when we try to study grammatical patterns in sort of

664
00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:45.848
idealized and written sentences? Because it might not really

665
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:52.699
be representative of the ways people normally use uh language

666
00:33:53.729 --> 00:33:57.759
? No, I think that's, that's 100% accurate

667
00:33:57.769 --> 00:34:00.348
and that, that's something that, you know,

668
00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:02.479
those of us who have done field research. I

669
00:34:02.489 --> 00:34:05.279
mean, these days, a lot of my research

670
00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:07.090
is at a computer with databases or whatever or even

671
00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:09.728
in a lab. But the field research in some

672
00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.599
ways is the hardest work I've ever done because you're

673
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.878
in this place where you're, you're trying to learn

674
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.179
another language. But what you have to go on

675
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:22.539
a lot of times are idealized, sort of simple

676
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.449
clauses that you're trying to learn and you can,

677
00:34:25.458 --> 00:34:30.090
without intention, you know, unintentionally, sometimes you

678
00:34:30.099 --> 00:34:31.728
can project a certain kind of structure on the language

679
00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:35.139
that you're learning, right? Because you're, even

680
00:34:35.148 --> 00:34:36.679
if you're a well trained linguist, you bring in

681
00:34:36.688 --> 00:34:38.070
all these biases of the things you want to learn

682
00:34:38.228 --> 00:34:40.800
of the kinds of structures you expect to find.

683
00:34:40.809 --> 00:34:43.840
And so you're asking them, how do you say

684
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:45.898
this, how do you say that? And we're

685
00:34:45.907 --> 00:34:47.489
aware of these things? And people will say,

686
00:34:47.498 --> 00:34:50.177
well, that's not how you really should do it

687
00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:52.548
, but it's really hard to do it any other

688
00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:54.039
way because life is too short, you know,

689
00:34:54.148 --> 00:34:57.697
like what's the best way? Well, maybe the

690
00:34:57.708 --> 00:34:59.898
best way is to go spend 20 years with an

691
00:34:59.907 --> 00:35:02.298
indigenous group without bringing your biases and just try to

692
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:06.608
absorb the language around you and sort of pay attention

693
00:35:06.617 --> 00:35:08.498
to what's more frequent and what's less frequent. That's

694
00:35:08.509 --> 00:35:12.289
pretty much impossible for an academic career, right?

695
00:35:12.298 --> 00:35:15.070
So what you find and this is alluded to in

696
00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.090
the book is a lot of the very best research

697
00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:22.550
in my opinion on indigenous languages comes from missionaries and

698
00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:24.250
that's not something we're always comfortable talking about in academia

699
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.978
, but the truth is, some of them don't

700
00:35:25.989 --> 00:35:28.570
do very good work. Some of them are the

701
00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:30.659
only people who have actually spent decades living with the

702
00:35:30.668 --> 00:35:34.320
group and sort of learning the language to the point

703
00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:36.188
that they can say, you know, during my

704
00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.909
first two years, I thought this was how the

705
00:35:37.918 --> 00:35:39.148
language works. And then I found out 10 years

706
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:42.090
later that's not at all how it works. Right

707
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:44.250
. But that takes a lot of time. I

708
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.523
think that you're totally right though, in terms of

709
00:35:45.534 --> 00:35:49.813
some of the issues, we bring methodologically what would

710
00:35:49.824 --> 00:35:52.523
be useful in some ways is what we need is

711
00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:54.583
what we are using now in languages like English that

712
00:35:54.594 --> 00:36:00.184
inform a chat GP T huge large language models that

713
00:36:00.195 --> 00:36:02.074
are based on just millions of clauses of data.

714
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.208
We just don't, we're not in a position to

715
00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:07.648
get that level of data from indigenous languages. But

716
00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:09.378
maybe we will be someday, you know, we'll

717
00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:14.969
be able to just record data in massive amounts and

718
00:36:14.978 --> 00:36:16.849
be able to figure out patterns in the data through

719
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.389
um in part through A I and other tools.

720
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.360
Yeah, maybe someday just uh doing some audio recording

721
00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:30.289
of people just naturally talking and then uh through A

722
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.099
I translating that into text and then analyzing it or

723
00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.648
something like that. Yeah, it's tough when there's

724
00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:38.378
not any, you know, A I is not

725
00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:42.349
going on anything, there's nothing already available on that

726
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.449
language. But yes, you can see how things

727
00:36:44.458 --> 00:36:45.860
might improve in that way. Um to be fair

728
00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:47.559
. A lot of field linguists these days, they

729
00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.039
do record a lot of data, but then still

730
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.829
they have to go through that data very time consuming

731
00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.019
. And so, you know, creating digital corpora

732
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.750
of data that they can just analyze maybe more objectively

733
00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:06.978
. That's, that's still very, very time consuming

734
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:12.329
. So another very interesting question in linguistics is,

735
00:37:12.398 --> 00:37:15.889
are, are words arbitrary? That is uh uh

736
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.659
I mean, are there any patterns in terms of

737
00:37:20.668 --> 00:37:24.458
certain meanings tended to be to go associated with certain

738
00:37:24.469 --> 00:37:29.159
specific sounds or even words? I mean, is

739
00:37:29.168 --> 00:37:35.570
that something that occurs or are just words basically arbitrary

740
00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:42.110
and any word can mean basically anything? Yeah,

741
00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:44.438
I mean, I think most words probably are arbitrary

742
00:37:44.449 --> 00:37:45.300
and can mean anything. And that's been the standard

743
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:49.530
line in linguistics research for a while. But increasingly

744
00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:50.719
, I would say, especially over the last 10

745
00:37:50.728 --> 00:37:53.340
years, there's been AAA growing number of studies showing

746
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:59.260
that more words, words are less arbitrary than we

747
00:37:59.269 --> 00:38:00.320
thought, right? Or at least some words are

748
00:38:00.329 --> 00:38:02.628
less arbitrary than we thought. So there are these

749
00:38:02.668 --> 00:38:09.349
systematic correspondences between sounds and meanings across the world's culture

750
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.188
. So, one of the best studies I know

751
00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:15.704
about this was done by that same colleague I mentioned

752
00:38:15.715 --> 00:38:16.945
earlier, Damian Blasi, where they, he and

753
00:38:16.954 --> 00:38:21.465
the team looked at thousands of languages and they found

754
00:38:21.474 --> 00:38:25.394
some clear associations between certain sounds and certain meanings even

755
00:38:25.405 --> 00:38:29.905
after controlling for a bunch of particular uh influences.

756
00:38:29.914 --> 00:38:31.114
Um So like one example that I'm, if I

757
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:36.559
recall correctly is um, the word for nose tends

758
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.878
to have a nasal sound in it. So something

759
00:38:38.889 --> 00:38:42.000
like nah, and you can sort of see why

760
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.469
that might be the case, right? When you

761
00:38:43.478 --> 00:38:45.820
have produce a nasal sound frequencies resonate in the nasal

762
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:49.500
cavity. And so maybe that makes it more perceptually

763
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.239
salient. What was really interesting about that study is

764
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.780
that there are obviously thousands of exceptions, right?

765
00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:59.329
It's, it's these very subtle tendencies that we,

766
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.699
there's no way we could have noticed, you know

767
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:04.719
, say 20 years ago. But as these databases

768
00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:07.599
have come online and as they're being refined, we're

769
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.688
starting to be able to ask these questions in new

770
00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:12.414
ways and test them in new ways. Things like

771
00:39:12.474 --> 00:39:15.043
uh is a sound system impacted by the environment,

772
00:39:15.054 --> 00:39:19.074
maybe not. But we could never really even ask

773
00:39:19.083 --> 00:39:21.974
and test that question before. Are, are this

774
00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:23.313
, are languages, are the words of languages maybe

775
00:39:23.324 --> 00:39:28.554
more um systematic in terms of how they map sounds

776
00:39:28.563 --> 00:39:30.418
and meanings than we once thought. Well, maybe

777
00:39:30.429 --> 00:39:32.199
, but we could never have tested this, you

778
00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:35.070
know, say 20 years ago. So it's requiring

779
00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:37.239
new methods, new databases to, to maybe change

780
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.789
our perspectives on some of these topics and language research

781
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.750
. And do we have any idea if there are

782
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.860
sort of basic words that occur in uh virtually all

783
00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:53.289
languages, you just to be clear, do you

784
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.340
mean semantics like in terms of content, like the

785
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:59.510
word meaning like the word? Yeah, I mean

786
00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:00.539
there there have been some suggestions of this, right

787
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:05.260
? But it's um so number words have been one

788
00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.179
of those suggestions, right? That was one of

789
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:07.909
the ones that at some point people said, OK

790
00:40:07.918 --> 00:40:12.219
, language is made different in terms of how many

791
00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:15.250
number words they have but every language has some precise

792
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.648
word for one and two turns out that doesn't seem

793
00:40:16.659 --> 00:40:20.148
to be the case. Although the vast majority do

794
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.099
same with color terms that used to be thought to

795
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.829
be universal, you know, not so clear anymore

796
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.809
. Same with something like the word for mother.

797
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.668
You know, I increasingly there was this influential article

798
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:36.329
by two linguists uh Nick Evans and Steven Levinson.

799
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.289
This was over 10 years ago now, were entitled

800
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.090
The Myth of Language Universals. And, and they

801
00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:44.090
went through some of these examples showing a lot of

802
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.699
these words that we thought were at least universal.

803
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:49.050
Even these. There, there always seems to be

804
00:40:49.059 --> 00:40:52.090
an exception somewhere, but there's very strong tendencies,

805
00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:57.239
right? So like it's, it's pretty much guaranteed

806
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.489
that a language is gonna have, you know,

807
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.449
pick a language at random that it's gonna have a

808
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:06.208
word for the concept one for instance. Uh And

809
00:41:06.219 --> 00:41:09.550
so I've asked you about uh some of the issues

810
00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:15.530
with having to actually have idealized and written form of

811
00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:19.840
a particular language to study it uh is it really

812
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:28.010
possible to accurately translate every word and expression? Yeah

813
00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:30.309
, I would say um I would say not,

814
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.958
right. And again, this is going to depend

815
00:41:30.969 --> 00:41:34.739
on how closely related the languages are, how closely

816
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.050
related the cultures are. But I think that we've

817
00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:40.148
, even if you speak two European languages as you

818
00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:43.019
do, at least that many, right? Or

819
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.978
like I grew up in Brazil, I speak is

820
00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:47.070
a lot better than I speak any Amazonian language.

821
00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:51.429
Even between Portuguese and English. I find sometimes that

822
00:41:51.438 --> 00:41:52.429
, that there's a little bit of loss in the

823
00:41:52.438 --> 00:41:55.860
translation, right? There's, there's some cultural nuance

824
00:41:55.869 --> 00:42:00.889
that's maybe missed as someone translates something into this language

825
00:42:00.898 --> 00:42:02.188
. You know that I like the example of the

826
00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:05.728
movie Lost in translation. You know that the movie

827
00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:09.168
entitled Lost in translation with Bill Murray that was titled

828
00:42:09.179 --> 00:42:12.438
very differently in a lot of different cultures because the

829
00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:15.619
expression lost in translation itself can get lost in translation

830
00:42:15.628 --> 00:42:19.010
, right? It's really hard to have it.

831
00:42:19.019 --> 00:42:22.228
Now. That's not to say that nothing is perfectly

832
00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.168
translatable. It's just that a lot of times we're

833
00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:28.619
trans translating things that are maybe almost perfectly translatable,

834
00:42:28.628 --> 00:42:30.958
but something is getting missed. There's some cultural nuance

835
00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:34.219
that's not being conveyed by a phrase in one language

836
00:42:34.228 --> 00:42:37.019
uh as it's translated into another. Now that that's

837
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:42.539
very interesting also because even when it comes to Portuguese

838
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.849
itself, because we have different versions of Portuguese,

839
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:51.168
like Brazilian, Portuguese and European Portuguese sometimes since you

840
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.739
mentioned lost in translation, the movie, it came

841
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:57.000
to my mind that sometimes for the same movie,

842
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.159
there are two different titles in Brazil and in Portugal

843
00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:04.628
. And one of them is better suited for a

844
00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:08.159
Brazilian audience because it combines the meaning better. And

845
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:12.668
the other one is better suited for a Portuguese audience

846
00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:15.708
even though it's almost the same language. Yeah,

847
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.269
that's a good point because then you're talking about what

848
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.289
, well, essentially dialects of the same language.

849
00:43:22.458 --> 00:43:24.728
Um Although anecdotally, I almost find Spanish easier to

850
00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:29.458
understand than when I'm in Portugal to, you know

851
00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:31.969
, because of the you guys uh from my perspective

852
00:43:31.978 --> 00:43:34.639
as someone who grew up in Brazil, you're dropping

853
00:43:34.648 --> 00:43:37.269
vowels all over the place, you know, but

854
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:38.489
it's, but I, I love the sound of

855
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.610
Brazilian Portuguese. But yeah, it's clearly, even

856
00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:44.269
though it's technically, you know, I mean,

857
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.570
I love the sound of European, Portuguese even though

858
00:43:45.579 --> 00:43:47.519
there's clearly different dialects, European. And so if

859
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.679
that can happen, even within two dialects is my

860
00:43:50.688 --> 00:43:52.110
point, then imagine what can happen when you get

861
00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:57.699
to very unrelated languages. Take something like um Kiana

862
00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:00.510
, the language that I mentioned and then pick some

863
00:44:00.918 --> 00:44:02.510
, you know, language in Australia or Eastern China

864
00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:05.389
or wherever you want to pick, there's going to

865
00:44:05.398 --> 00:44:07.550
be all kinds of things that, that are lost

866
00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:10.949
related to the environments of these different places related to

867
00:44:10.958 --> 00:44:15.188
the cultural context. That doesn't mean you can't translate

868
00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:17.039
it all of course, people do it. But

869
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.869
it means that there, the idea of perfect translation

870
00:44:20.878 --> 00:44:22.119
may be a myth at least when you're going between

871
00:44:22.128 --> 00:44:28.449
certain languages. So I have perhaps two more questions

872
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:30.708
here. One of them, since your book is

873
00:44:30.719 --> 00:44:36.030
basically about linguistic diversity and how uh for example,

874
00:44:36.039 --> 00:44:39.639
social relationships or our society is structured and the environment

875
00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:44.938
that we are exposed to influence our particular languages evolve

876
00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:49.429
. And also how by using particular words, terms

877
00:44:49.438 --> 00:44:52.489
and languages, it also influences how we perceive the

878
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.780
world in at least to a certain extent. What

879
00:44:55.789 --> 00:45:01.688
are your thoughts on the word hypothesis? Yeah.

880
00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:05.918
So Super War warf hypothesis is interesting in part because

881
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:08.510
Super and Wharf never actually co-authored anything. It's not

882
00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:10.668
like they sat down that term always makes it seem

883
00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:13.869
like they sat down and wrote some hypothesis out,

884
00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:15.458
you know, and like really work. But it

885
00:45:15.469 --> 00:45:19.949
was really um war's work um amongst the Hopi tribe

886
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:22.478
in the in the United States that, that gave

887
00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:25.219
this a lot of impetus and the idea is related

888
00:45:25.228 --> 00:45:29.079
to things like how they talk about time and some

889
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.280
of his suggestions haven't really, you know, stood

890
00:45:32.289 --> 00:45:36.409
the test of time. But I think that the

891
00:45:36.418 --> 00:45:39.239
general point that that is sometimes referred to by superior

892
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:43.679
war hypothesis may be accurate in the sense that languages

893
00:45:43.688 --> 00:45:46.958
do impact cognitive processes, like linguistic diversity does impact

894
00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:52.820
cognitive processes, but these impacts can be pretty subtle

895
00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.099
. Um So I think the way that it's commonly

896
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:59.898
construed as is maybe off, right, like Super

897
00:46:00.019 --> 00:46:01.590
Wharf is sometimes taken as, oh, like you

898
00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:05.619
speak a different language, you know, say you

899
00:46:05.628 --> 00:46:07.628
speak KPI, you really just don't get the passing

900
00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:09.320
of time or anything. Like it's just a totally

901
00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:13.059
different, you're living a more centered existence or something

902
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.458
like that. And that was never what Super or

903
00:46:15.469 --> 00:46:19.679
Wharf meant in the first place. Um So it's

904
00:46:19.688 --> 00:46:21.119
, it's kind of that the, the issue with

905
00:46:21.128 --> 00:46:23.039
that the the label Super Wharf is that it's come

906
00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.550
to mean all these different things that I don't think

907
00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:29.978
even Wharf meant it to mean, right? Um

908
00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:31.090
The, the the example that I start the book

909
00:46:31.099 --> 00:46:34.659
off with kind of tongue in cheek is the words

910
00:46:34.668 --> 00:46:37.139
for Snow example, right? Where that's something that

911
00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:40.280
like is associated with the Super Wharf hypothesis. But

912
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:44.449
these, it, it it actually goes back to

913
00:46:44.458 --> 00:46:46.539
the work of some other linguists. Even Franz Boas

914
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.010
was the first one who really pointed out like these

915
00:46:50.019 --> 00:46:52.728
different words for Snow and different indigenous groups that they

916
00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:54.429
maybe had more. But he never said anything about

917
00:46:54.438 --> 00:46:58.570
there being hundreds of words for Snow and Eskimo or

918
00:46:58.668 --> 00:47:00.090
you know, like, and you can see the

919
00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:02.478
cycle of exaggeration that that this claim is tied to

920
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:05.360
like and some of it's in the media. So

921
00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:06.800
I think even at one point, the New York

922
00:47:06.809 --> 00:47:09.728
Times had some quote about there are hundreds of words

923
00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:13.539
for Snow and in Eskimo, which is just not

924
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.039
true, it's just patently untrue. And so part

925
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.639
of the issue with the Super War warf hypothesis is

926
00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:20.719
that it has about a century's worth of baggage.

927
00:47:20.728 --> 00:47:23.079
Now that's been carried through the media in different places

928
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:28.429
and it's distorted, was maybe inaccurate in some places

929
00:47:28.438 --> 00:47:29.168
. But at the end of the day, a

930
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.659
fairly reasonable points made by, by Wharf and then

931
00:47:31.668 --> 00:47:34.659
kind of distorted them. And it took research in

932
00:47:34.668 --> 00:47:37.059
the nineties and in the last 30 years to address

933
00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.539
this topic um in more subtle ways and actually get

934
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:45.039
at this idea of do different do linguistic disparities actually

935
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:50.188
impact human cognitive processes and, and, and the

936
00:47:50.199 --> 00:47:52.360
answer is yes, although sometimes the answer is a

937
00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.989
subtle one and sometimes the answer seems to be no

938
00:47:54.199 --> 00:47:57.010
, you know, we expect to find some difference

939
00:47:57.019 --> 00:47:59.378
but you do some experimental tests and there don't really

940
00:47:59.389 --> 00:48:01.000
seem to be any differences across populations in terms of

941
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.989
how they, they think about a given thing.

942
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.969
So that less exciting than like, oh, it

943
00:48:07.978 --> 00:48:09.929
determines how you think or no, it doesn't determine

944
00:48:09.938 --> 00:48:12.139
how you think, you know, the answers are

945
00:48:12.148 --> 00:48:15.289
often in the gray areas. I think. So

946
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.719
, one last question then, um since we've been

947
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:22.010
talking about the diversity of language, I would also

948
00:48:22.019 --> 00:48:24.449
like to ask you if you have any idea if

949
00:48:24.458 --> 00:48:30.849
this is sort of representative or illustrative or one small

950
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:37.429
example of a broader discussion that is sort of ongoing

951
00:48:37.438 --> 00:48:39.659
in psychology and cognitive science, I guess about the

952
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.699
universality of our psychology more broadly in terms of,

953
00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:52.489
if we really across all societies share the same uh

954
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.829
information processing mechanisms or mechanisms or not, I mean

955
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.590
, do, do you think that this perhaps might

956
00:49:00.599 --> 00:49:04.438
play a role in that sort of discussion or a

957
00:49:04.449 --> 00:49:07.260
and if so do you think that perhaps we uh

958
00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:10.349
we might also be assuming at least in certain instances

959
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:15.219
too much universality when it comes to human cognition or

960
00:49:15.228 --> 00:49:17.708
not? I think so, it depends on who

961
00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:20.438
you talk to, right? So some people now

962
00:49:20.449 --> 00:49:23.409
assume less universality. I have really close colleagues who

963
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:27.110
are evolutionary psychologists and I actually find a lot of

964
00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:29.250
that work pretty stimulating. I don't agree with all

965
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.519
of it, but they're sort of interested in what

966
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.708
are the, what are the processes, the evolutionary

967
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:37.099
processes that may maybe gave humans certain biases to think

968
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.329
about things in certain ways that would have presented selective

969
00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.579
advantages. That's a totally reasonable thing to think about

970
00:49:44.989 --> 00:49:47.019
. Um On the other hand, you know,

971
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.010
we only left Africa in waves as a species like

972
00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:52.789
100,000 years ago. That's not a lot of time

973
00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.340
, right? In terms of so those kinds of

974
00:49:57.349 --> 00:50:00.489
pressures are probably applied to all cultures, right?

975
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.429
Like I, I would guess I would guess that

976
00:50:02.438 --> 00:50:06.579
there's not a lot that's hardwired about us that's different

977
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.260
. Um But that doesn't mean that it's universally,

978
00:50:09.269 --> 00:50:13.619
that universality is the answer, right? Because the

979
00:50:13.628 --> 00:50:15.119
main thing, it seems to me reading into some

980
00:50:15.128 --> 00:50:19.320
of these fields is that the the overarching theme is

981
00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:22.780
that uh cortical plasticity, right? We're just this

982
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:25.458
like incredibly adaptive species and we do seem to do

983
00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:29.159
things that are kind of unique, like pay attention

984
00:50:29.168 --> 00:50:31.780
to the intentions of other members of our species and

985
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:36.969
we're clearly more social. Um But so the answer

986
00:50:36.978 --> 00:50:38.688
is just like sort of this clear plasticity, which

987
00:50:38.699 --> 00:50:42.559
allows for a lot of variability across groups in terms

988
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.300
of how we problem solve. And in terms of

989
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:45.929
how we, how we see the world in some

990
00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:47.889
ways. But that I guess my point is that

991
00:50:47.898 --> 00:50:52.469
I don't think that that's necessarily hardwired in us.

992
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.039
I think what's hardwired is this sort of a general

993
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.909
flexibility of cognition um which allows us to confront all

994
00:50:58.918 --> 00:51:01.389
sorts of challenges in unique ways and then maybe those

995
00:51:01.398 --> 00:51:05.769
are affected by culture and language over time so that

996
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.159
you get very different ways of addressing certain problems in

997
00:51:08.168 --> 00:51:12.128
the world around us based on the cultural and linguistic

998
00:51:12.139 --> 00:51:15.300
lineage that you're familiar with. Yes, because even

999
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:19.739
though perhaps there's no been enough time since we left

1000
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.458
Africa for us to be to have acquired, let's

1001
00:51:22.469 --> 00:51:28.148
say new cognitive adaptations through genetic evolution, we also

1002
00:51:28.159 --> 00:51:31.139
have cultural evolution, for example. Right. Yes

1003
00:51:31.148 --> 00:51:32.849
, exactly. And that's ultimately a lot of this

1004
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.929
book is indirectly about cultural evolution, right? Like

1005
00:51:36.938 --> 00:51:40.500
things people adapt to different places and sometimes it's actually

1006
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:44.139
clearly an adaptive process. Sometimes it's just a matter

1007
00:51:44.148 --> 00:51:45.780
of, like I said, it's more an analogous

1008
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:47.500
to genetic drift where there's lots of different cultures,

1009
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:50.590
people doing different things, some things are going to

1010
00:51:50.599 --> 00:51:52.239
succeed in some environments, some things are just going

1011
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:55.860
to be different just because they're different. But we

1012
00:51:55.869 --> 00:52:00.340
can clearly change a lot over a short amount of

1013
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:02.099
time. Right. And so I don't want to

1014
00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:05.099
trivialize that point. So like if you take something

1015
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:08.300
like literacy, writing has only been around about 5000

1016
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:12.219
years, that's like nothing in terms of our trajectory

1017
00:52:12.228 --> 00:52:14.820
as a species. And until the last couple 100

1018
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:16.719
years and really the last 100 years, the vast

1019
00:52:16.728 --> 00:52:19.829
majority of people even in the West were, were

1020
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.139
not literate, right? And so, and there's

1021
00:52:22.148 --> 00:52:24.188
plenty of research showing that learning how to read and

1022
00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:27.438
write and learning math at an early age has certain

1023
00:52:27.449 --> 00:52:30.958
neural cognitive effects um that that you can detect in

1024
00:52:30.969 --> 00:52:34.719
lots of different ways. And so these are profound

1025
00:52:34.728 --> 00:52:37.300
, these can be profound effects that sort of differences

1026
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:38.769
cross culturally. So even if we start off with

1027
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.159
a general sort of plasticity that we all share,

1028
00:52:42.469 --> 00:52:45.789
that doesn't mean that the effects are trivial, right

1029
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.090
? Cross culturally great. So the book is again

1030
00:52:50.099 --> 00:52:52.449
, a myriad of tongues, our languages reveal differences

1031
00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:55.059
in how we think I'm leaving a link to it

1032
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.610
in the description box of the interview. And Dr

1033
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.739
Everett just before we go apart from the book,

1034
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.128
we would like to tell people where they can find

1035
00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.840
your work on the internet. Oh, yeah,

1036
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:09.559
working. So my previous book is um Numbers in

1037
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.360
the making of us. So if you just Google

1038
00:53:12.369 --> 00:53:15.168
that you can find that also and it addresses similar

1039
00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:17.199
concept of human diversity, but with respect to number

1040
00:53:17.208 --> 00:53:21.208
systems and how they evolved, I have another book

1041
00:53:21.219 --> 00:53:23.250
but it's more sort of academic in nature. So

1042
00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:27.679
maybe less interesting of a read. Um But yeah

1043
00:53:27.688 --> 00:53:29.760
, Google, my name and the research and,

1044
00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:30.239
and, and you, and you'll find it.

1045
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.239
But um yeah, I'm excited about this book and

1046
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.478
it was great to talk to you about it.
