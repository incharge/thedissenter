00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.000
the Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.448
. And today I'm joined by Doctor Claudio 10.

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.978
He is a tenured research group leader in the Department

5
00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.138
of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of

6
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.589
Tubingen. This is our second interview. I'm leaving

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.690
the link to our first one in the description box

8
00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.978
. Uh And today we're going to talk basically about

9
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.908
the differences between ape culture and human culture. So

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.149
, Doctor 10 Year, welcome back to the show

11
00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:35.899
. It's always a pleasure to talk to you.

12
00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.590
It's a great pleasure to talk to you and thank

13
00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:40.279
you very much for having me a second time.

14
00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.759
Thanks, great. So OK, let's perhaps start

15
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.240
with some basics here. Uh How would you define

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.770
ape culture? What is ape culture? Right?

17
00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.029
Yeah. Well, uh ape culture would be cultures

18
00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.908
um shown by apes. But when we talk about

19
00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:03.719
culture generally, and this is uh always news for

20
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.198
newcomers to the field. At first, it turns

21
00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.418
out that culture is quite a slippery fish. It's

22
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.859
quite difficult to uh measure it to, to really

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.290
get hold of uh culture generally, not just in

24
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.519
apes anywhere. And um to see why that is

25
00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:23.278
, you know, we can imagine that we can

26
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.409
measure genes, you know, the existence of genes

27
00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.689
. Anyway, um what to make with this data

28
00:01:27.698 --> 00:01:30.359
is a different matter. But we can measure them

29
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.469
, you know, we can find them same for

30
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.319
environment. You know, we can measure the temperature

31
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.299
somewhere, we can measure the humidity, uh someplace

32
00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:41.930
and so on. But with culture, it is

33
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.879
difficult, it continues to be difficult to really measure

34
00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:49.198
our culture. Culture is something that happens out in

35
00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.659
the world sometimes stays out in the world such as

36
00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:55.459
cultural artifacts and so on. But it is also

37
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.278
something that is very much in minds in brains.

38
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.500
And we don't have very good means to get to

39
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.120
these brains, you know, uh it's not something

40
00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.270
that I personally do, for example. So the

41
00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:09.758
general approach had been then in the past, in

42
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.990
order to try to pinpoint culture is to take away

43
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.460
the signal and the factors from other um uh areas

44
00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.860
. So, for example, to try to find

45
00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.379
, if you control for, if you measure and

46
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.038
, and um adjust for genetic differences, and if

47
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.770
you measure and control for environmental differences between populations,

48
00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:38.740
if you do both of these things, the idea

49
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.028
is that what is left over, if there is

50
00:02:42.038 --> 00:02:45.538
some difference, still left over between these populations,

51
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.050
that you can call that difference um cut. So

52
00:02:50.058 --> 00:02:53.069
it's an approach that the philosophers call an X Negativo

53
00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:59.439
approach. It's basically defining uh something by uh the

54
00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.939
absence of all the other things. Um And that

55
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.599
is what, what culture has been uh come to

56
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.919
be seen. And also in the apes, I

57
00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:09.639
can talk more later, maybe about this, but

58
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.429
population differences between apes that are not very obviously linked

59
00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.389
to genetic differences and um environmental differences, that's what

60
00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.368
people call ape culture. Uh And so, uh

61
00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.778
I would imagine that we can study ape culture through

62
00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:32.919
different means. So I guess that perhaps some aspects

63
00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:37.028
of it could be studied in the lab, but

64
00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.750
we can also study ape culture in the wild.

65
00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:46.229
So, um uh what do we know about wild

66
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.770
ape culture? And is it similar or different to

67
00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:54.099
human culture? Yes. So wild ape culture is

68
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.580
a prototypical case of ape culture. Wild ape culture

69
00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:02.099
is what most people focus on. Really when you

70
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.088
, when you open up your TV channel and you

71
00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.919
see David Attenborough come up and talk about, I

72
00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.319
don't know chimpanzee nut cracking or something and so on

73
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.849
. And then they would invariably talk about some culture

74
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:17.660
there. That's what they are ultimately uh on about

75
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.488
, they talk about these dissimilarities between populations and they

76
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.449
call that um culture. And again, uh when

77
00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.488
, when you ask about the similarities, now,

78
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.759
now we get into the topic of what we are

79
00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:36.290
talking about today. Um The similarities uh there is

80
00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:41.569
some similarity in the sense that indeed we also see

81
00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:45.548
in humans, population differences, right, the way

82
00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.129
that I eat uh rice might be different to how

83
00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.209
some other people and some other populations eat rice.

84
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.238
Right? So there are some differences and these differences

85
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.899
can indeed be meaningfully linked to some cultural processes.

86
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.428
So on that level, on the surface level,

87
00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:04.920
we are dealing with a similar phenomenon, we are

88
00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:09.069
dealing with population differences. And by the way,

89
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:12.028
if somebody were to say this is a cultural difference

90
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.738
, you know, on this very rough level,

91
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.678
just to talk about culture per se, I have

92
00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.720
no problem with that. Um uh If you know

93
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.329
, if the method of exclusion, that's this method

94
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:26.689
to exclude genetic and environmental differences. If, if

95
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.519
it had been applied correctly, uh then, you

96
00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:30.250
know, I have no problem with that. But

97
00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.649
this does not mean that the culture specifics underlying these

98
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.290
cases are or must be the same. And this

99
00:05:41.298 --> 00:05:46.028
is basically where I have the biggest difficulties always in

100
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.579
getting our main point across the main point from my

101
00:05:48.588 --> 00:05:51.939
research group is to say they, that is not

102
00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.699
to say that apes don't have culture. This is

103
00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:59.699
a point that is very frequently misconstruct. The point

104
00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:00.798
is not to say that apes don't have culture.

105
00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.439
The point is to say Ape apes have culture,

106
00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.259
but that culture might be very different from the culture

107
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:13.519
of humans. That's essentially our main point here.

108
00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:15.759
Um Yeah, but, but, but, but

109
00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:16.439
the rest of the devil is in the details and

110
00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.838
so on. Uh But I'm sure we're gonna get

111
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.420
to this. Yeah. But do you think that

112
00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:27.139
when studying a culture, uh we have to be

113
00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:31.459
careful about, uh what would probably be some of

114
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.778
the differences that arise between, for example, studying

115
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.129
it uh when the animals are uh captive versus uh

116
00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.798
in the wild? Um Well, there are different

117
00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.389
opinions on that. Uh The, the opinion,

118
00:06:50.088 --> 00:06:54.238
the main opinion is, I guess for most people

119
00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:57.230
out in the world, many, most people are

120
00:06:57.238 --> 00:07:00.048
very interested in apes generally and they are somehow very

121
00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.040
interested in ape culture generally. But when they are

122
00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:08.199
interested in these things, they are usually interested most

123
00:07:09.108 --> 00:07:13.509
in the wild ape cultural case. However, you

124
00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:15.619
can also do similar methods, you can apply them

125
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.910
across different populations of captive apes, for example.

126
00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:24.949
And then you can find also some population differences between

127
00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:30.048
these captive populations that suggests, it suggests that perhaps

128
00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:33.889
we are dealing here with similar phenomenon, meaning that

129
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:39.369
the similar phenomenon might be underlain by very similar mechanisms

130
00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.238
as well. But here is where then some people

131
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.220
um disagree. Some people would then say there is

132
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.079
a, there is a big difference between wild apes

133
00:07:48.088 --> 00:07:51.100
and captive apes. And uh that is, I

134
00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:55.309
mean, theoretically speaking, you know, that could

135
00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.980
well be. Um but then you look at the

136
00:07:58.988 --> 00:08:01.819
arguments and the there is already a problem, the

137
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.420
arguments that people then bring are go are pointing to

138
00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:09.670
completely the opposite patterns. So I'm not explaining this

139
00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:16.410
very well. People make different claims with regard to

140
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.369
this difference, wildly different claims. So some people

141
00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.709
essentially claim I, I have to turn this down

142
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.738
a little bit here because we don't have much time

143
00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:28.259
. Um So I'm painting with a very broad brush

144
00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.778
here. Some people would then say that um captive

145
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.320
apes are stupid. Again, I'm painting with a

146
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.200
broad brush. Uh So then they would say the

147
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.399
captive apes, they, they can't do very much

148
00:08:39.408 --> 00:08:41.590
and so on the wild apes, they can do

149
00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.908
many more things and they are really clever ones and

150
00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:46.599
so on. So these people would then essentially claim

151
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:54.250
that captivity impoverishes the cognition, um intelligence if you

152
00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:56.308
so on, you know, of these things.

153
00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:00.788
But then you look and some other people say the

154
00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:03.969
exact opposite. They say actually, you know,

155
00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:05.570
there is a thing they call it a captivity effect

156
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.440
doesn't matter what it's called now. And they say

157
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.168
, oh actually, it turns out that the captive

158
00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:15.879
ones, they are the ones that are showing improved

159
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.389
cognition. So there is a huge problem here.

160
00:09:18.408 --> 00:09:24.690
And um logically speaking, uh unless you finesse it

161
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.349
down into more details, logically speaking, on this

162
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.879
level, one side must be wrong, right?

163
00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:35.029
It cannot be both correct that they are impoverished and

164
00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:37.668
improved in, in their cognition. So that's already

165
00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:43.399
shown you um part of the divide that we have

166
00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:46.080
in the field where people talk about different things without

167
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.570
even agreeing on the basics, even agreeing, they

168
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.330
can't even agree on the overall patterns as it were

169
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.038
. But if you can't agree on this overall patterns

170
00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:01.389
, and it will be very difficult also to frankly

171
00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.599
answer once and for all the questions that you ask

172
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:03.808
me, it's a good question. You know,

173
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.918
is there a difference between the culture of the captive

174
00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:11.418
apes and the word? And there currently it depends

175
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.969
who you ask. Those people who say that uh

176
00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:16.879
the the uh captive apes are impoverished, they will

177
00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:20.649
give you a different answer than those who say uh

178
00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:22.389
you know, that the captive apes are improved in

179
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:26.340
their cognition or enhanced in their cognition. I personally

180
00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:31.009
think that the difference between wild apes and captive apes

181
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:37.349
doesn't go as extreme in one direction or the other

182
00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:39.418
as some of these scams have been made, right

183
00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:41.879
? Uh I think also if you, if you

184
00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:43.989
think about it for a second, the fact that

185
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.879
that can be people who, who promote the idea

186
00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:48.149
that, you know, the the difference is like

187
00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:50.960
this, you know, and the others promote the

188
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.820
exact opposite uh idea. Well, maybe what really

189
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.269
is happening is that the, the real difference is

190
00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:03.029
not all that great. And indeed, um unless

191
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:05.389
we talk about incarcerated apes and so on so forth

192
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.739
, we, we might do so later. Um

193
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.200
Unless you talk about this, the difference is not

194
00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.149
that great. Uh And so my answer then would

195
00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:20.000
be quite similar. My answer would be to say

196
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:24.558
, captive apes are also able to um have an

197
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.519
ape culture just like wild apes do. It's just

198
00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:31.369
that most people focus on white ape culture. That

199
00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:35.359
would be my my personal short answer to that question

200
00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:37.200
. But I mean, I've also asked you about

201
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.489
that because sometimes when we talk about studies that are

202
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.509
done in uh not only with animals but also with

203
00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:50.899
uh humans in the lab, uh There are people

204
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.899
uh that bring to the table criticisms regarding for example

205
00:11:54.908 --> 00:12:00.359
, ecological validity, right? Of those studies.

206
00:12:00.369 --> 00:12:03.418
But I mean, perhaps I'm saying something that is

207
00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:07.590
completely wrong and if so please correct me. But

208
00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:11.580
uh I mean, I I if um couldn't we

209
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.178
treat, let's say captive animals or animals studied in

210
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:22.859
the lab as uh I mean, those artificial settings

211
00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:26.759
as a different ecology. I mean, would that

212
00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:30.570
make sense? It would, it would absolutely make

213
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.408
sense. You know, we can even go into

214
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:35.308
an evil route. You could, you could and

215
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.519
people have done that. Unfortunately, in the past

216
00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:39.590
, you can take um single chimpanzees, right?

217
00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:43.649
So you it's a social animal and you better treat

218
00:12:43.658 --> 00:12:45.918
them as social animals and you keep them as social

219
00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:48.658
animals but, but people have taken them and put

220
00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:50.950
them in single cages and that's not only is that

221
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.029
super cruel, we don't need to talk about that

222
00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:54.918
. Everybody would agree that that's a cool thing to

223
00:12:54.928 --> 00:12:58.070
do but that kind of thing, that kind of

224
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.129
thing I am convinced that that does deprive these apes

225
00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:09.038
and it leads to impoverished cognition. So how,

226
00:13:09.048 --> 00:13:11.330
how can we expand from this uh case? Right

227
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:11.840
, we can expand from it in, in the

228
00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:15.820
following way, I think we can ask the the

229
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.580
more sensible question and the question that can be measured

230
00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:22.450
like how similar to the wild do we need to

231
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.340
create conditions in order to make these cases ecologically comparable

232
00:13:28.928 --> 00:13:31.269
? This is very important because when we do that

233
00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.729
, we see that there is not one type of

234
00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:39.009
ecology for chimpanzees. Let's talk about chimpanzees. Generally

235
00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:39.349
, we can talk about all the A I DS

236
00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:43.298
but chimpanzees are the typical case to talk about.

237
00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:46.029
So when we look at chimpanzees across, you know

238
00:13:46.038 --> 00:13:50.168
, Africa, uh we see that they live too

239
00:13:50.178 --> 00:13:52.820
in very widely different situations in different environments, you

240
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:58.000
know, but also in different sizes of populations.

241
00:13:58.529 --> 00:14:01.308
That is simply the case, right? Um So

242
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.340
some live in small populations actually, you know,

243
00:14:03.349 --> 00:14:07.229
this is there is also an interference with human observation

244
00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:09.349
there, but let's not go in in that direction

245
00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:11.553
. Um And some live in very big uh uh

246
00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:16.484
environments um in big groups and they live in this

247
00:14:16.494 --> 00:14:20.024
different environments too. So what we can glean from

248
00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.144
that is the following, we can glean from that

249
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.173
. And, and we can also imagine that in

250
00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:26.553
the past in the environment of evolutionary adapted this of

251
00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.375
, of uh chimpanzees and so on. In the

252
00:14:28.384 --> 00:14:33.404
past, there were very likely more variability in their

253
00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:39.940
living conditions. So actually many different environments, social

254
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:45.158
environments and physical environments, many different environments are compatible

255
00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:48.469
within chimpanzee life, which means that this is good

256
00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:52.090
news as it were for those captive workers. Because

257
00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:56.979
now it's not altogether immediately clear that if you have

258
00:14:56.989 --> 00:15:00.149
a good zoo that provide the aids with uh big

259
00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:03.759
enclosure, say that keep them in uh social settings

260
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:05.558
, the chimpanzees, especially in social settings, right

261
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.369
? It's not immediately obvious and it's not an immediate

262
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.349
, you know, Trump card against captive work to

263
00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.599
say that there are some differences between this situation and

264
00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:18.649
the wild situations. You know, you can always

265
00:15:18.658 --> 00:15:22.450
find the differences. Yes. But the question is

266
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.379
, how much do they matter? And if you

267
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:26.389
frame it like that, I think it's easy to

268
00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.979
see that the answer will depend, right? I

269
00:15:28.989 --> 00:15:31.940
would, I would say uh some zoos are more

270
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:37.639
ecologically relevant or similar to the range of environments that

271
00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:41.609
uh wild apes have, right? Some are less

272
00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:43.889
, you know, yes, in an ideal world

273
00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:45.580
, you, you take that into account, but

274
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.529
that's why we always report also where we run our

275
00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:50.359
studies. So later meta reviews and so on can

276
00:15:50.369 --> 00:15:54.149
look out for these things. But as I said

277
00:15:54.158 --> 00:15:58.570
earlier, when we actually look, the differences don't

278
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.469
seem to be all that great. Again, if

279
00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:04.408
people have widely different opinions on that. Probably the

280
00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:07.580
truth is somewhere in the middle, which in this

281
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.109
case means they are not altogether incomparable. Yes.

282
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:18.269
So, uh going back to the wild apes specifically

283
00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:21.928
earlier, I asked you, uh if their culture

284
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.808
is similar or different to humans when it comes to

285
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.840
the differences, do we know exactly what they are

286
00:16:30.428 --> 00:16:34.788
in what ways wild health culture is different from the

287
00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:40.190
human culture? Um Well, many people, when

288
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.109
you ask them, many people would point immediately to

289
00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:47.690
language and they would say humans have language and AIDS

290
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.729
, don't that's what many people would say to a

291
00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:53.979
large degree. I think it's true. Then again

292
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:56.788
, when, when, when you look more closely

293
00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:59.440
, well, what is language? Language is a

294
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.879
form of communication, right? OK. Do apes

295
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:03.439
have communication? Surely they have communication, right?

296
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.489
They even have a communication on different channels, you

297
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.858
know, they can uh use gestures, they can

298
00:17:08.868 --> 00:17:12.039
use sounds, you know, so it's not that

299
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:15.759
there is a complete lack of complexity, say in

300
00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:18.459
their, in their communication, right? And then

301
00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:22.890
you get into essentially linguistics, lin linguistic debates which

302
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.699
are always tough to follow, let's say, right

303
00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:29.568
? Uh They are more for the specialists. And

304
00:17:29.578 --> 00:17:33.098
so let me just summarize what I think most linguists

305
00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:34.890
would say. They would say while that is true

306
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.739
that they have this communication, et cetera, et

307
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.029
cetera. There are some big differences still and what

308
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:44.368
you always find every year when you, when you

309
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.680
look at this literature, you know, the the

310
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:49.000
the aid researchers, they, they chip away every

311
00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:51.250
year a little bit, you know, they chip

312
00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:53.209
away at these differences, right? But the chips

313
00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:56.219
that they remove are usually not very, very large

314
00:17:56.229 --> 00:18:00.828
. So the the the overall picture is that a

315
00:18:00.838 --> 00:18:03.640
communication does, I think that it is fair to

316
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.920
say does get closer to human language over time.

317
00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:10.578
But the steps don't seem to be as big as

318
00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:12.838
they would ever reach a complete overlap. Let me

319
00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:15.939
put it this way, right? I'm not an

320
00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:18.140
ape language researcher. Let me, let me,

321
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.640
let me say it like that. But that is

322
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.519
my interpretation from all of this. But in my

323
00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:26.890
own approach, I try to go one step deeper

324
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.739
. I take the following as um as granted,

325
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.868
one major assumption of my, my work is also

326
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.769
and I take this from the linguists. Um they

327
00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:42.449
describe language in all kinds of ways and some specifics

328
00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:45.479
of languages also that we learn from each other,

329
00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:48.380
the words or in gestural language, you know,

330
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.368
in sign language that the specific gestures from each other

331
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.088
, right? The fact that we speak English together

332
00:18:56.098 --> 00:18:57.733
, right? Uh I think none of us as

333
00:18:57.743 --> 00:19:00.334
a as a native speaker, right? That is

334
00:19:00.344 --> 00:19:03.875
because we learned these things from others and also even

335
00:19:03.884 --> 00:19:07.414
our native languages, we learned these things from others

336
00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:10.493
, right? We learned these words from others.

337
00:19:10.953 --> 00:19:14.094
But then what are words in a in a way

338
00:19:14.104 --> 00:19:18.390
um words are a specific type of information. Um

339
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.259
It's in the vocal domain, let's stick with the

340
00:19:22.269 --> 00:19:26.650
vocal domain now. And it's sequences of certain pronunciations

341
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.500
and so on that you really have to learn as

342
00:19:29.509 --> 00:19:33.118
this all sequences a slow. And in my lab

343
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.189
, we, we call this and other cases,

344
00:19:36.199 --> 00:19:40.039
we call that, know how, know how to

345
00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:44.250
pronounce a word, know how to pronounce the word

346
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.189
uh printer, know how to pronounce the word word

347
00:19:47.199 --> 00:19:48.390
water bottle. You know, that, that kind

348
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.420
of thing it is about, know how and,

349
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.489
and I know uh you know, I've, I've

350
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.209
moved away quite a bit from your original question.

351
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:59.250
I haven't forgotten the question was what is the difference

352
00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:02.660
between ape and human culture? Right? OK.

353
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.719
So let's take for granted that language is still the

354
00:20:04.729 --> 00:20:07.400
big difference maker. But now we see that in

355
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.858
order to get language, you need several factors as

356
00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:14.500
the linguist, they've got whole list. But one

357
00:20:14.509 --> 00:20:17.979
of these factors that is necessary is that you need

358
00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:22.078
to be able to copy arbitrary strings, arbitrary,

359
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:26.529
know how. And another way of saying that is

360
00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:29.890
you need to copy, know how that you yourself

361
00:20:29.949 --> 00:20:32.848
will not have come up with uh any time in

362
00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:36.420
your life unless you had copied it from others.

363
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.299
So nobody wakes up in the morning without ever having

364
00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:42.809
had contact with uh Mandarin and speaks Mandarin. You

365
00:20:42.818 --> 00:20:45.140
know that that is just not the case. We

366
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.759
all know this, but the the background to that

367
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:52.309
is that it consists among other things of know how

368
00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:56.328
pronouncing all these words um that we could not just

369
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.199
produce our own. So our lab, we call

370
00:20:59.209 --> 00:21:00.799
that and I know it's a bit of a mouthful

371
00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:04.568
, right? We call that super individual, know

372
00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:10.568
how s above individual beyond the individual. No,

373
00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:14.000
is the term. The whole idea goes back to

374
00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:17.459
classical uh research and cultural evolution. The whole idea

375
00:21:17.469 --> 00:21:21.098
goes back to Boyd and Richardson who pointed out that

376
00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:22.318
, you know, a special type of culture,

377
00:21:22.328 --> 00:21:26.559
cumulative culture, I would like to add cumulative culture

378
00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:30.328
of know how produces, you know, ways of

379
00:21:30.338 --> 00:21:33.348
doing things and so on. Um that nobody on

380
00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:37.868
their own could develop uh from scratch anymore. So

381
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.390
we just, you know, we just gave this

382
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.969
a label. Uh We, we specified a little

383
00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:45.368
bit more, we said it's about know how and

384
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.380
we specified uh you know, the whole idea in

385
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.404
the extrovert super individual. So the difference then,

386
00:21:52.443 --> 00:21:53.765
and this is the high positive, but it's really

387
00:21:53.775 --> 00:21:56.983
very well supported by now, the difference is that

388
00:21:56.993 --> 00:22:02.904
humans have recounted them roughly and we found billions,

389
00:22:02.914 --> 00:22:07.184
billions of cases of super individual know-how across the whole

390
00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:10.670
planet, across all humans, billions. And then

391
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.509
in the case of the apes, you know,

392
00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:15.000
do they have super individual? Know how, I

393
00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:17.180
mean, the interview is continuing, we can talk

394
00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:18.640
more about that. But let me give you a

395
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.289
very rough answer. And the answer is if,

396
00:22:22.618 --> 00:22:29.160
if apes have, I should specify un incarcerated,

397
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.509
untrained apes, if they have super individual know how

398
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:36.269
they have it in very rare cases. So a

399
00:22:36.729 --> 00:22:40.368
couple of cases, maybe a handful of cases,

400
00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.769
but maybe also they have none and these handful of

401
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:47.759
cases may be illusions. Um But then we have

402
00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:49.809
the answer in focus. Now the answer is essentially

403
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.348
uh human life would be widely different. What is

404
00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:57.299
inconceivable in its current form. If we were to

405
00:22:57.309 --> 00:23:00.750
take all these super individual know how away everything would

406
00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:03.949
come to a grinding halt. We wouldn't have computers

407
00:23:04.035 --> 00:23:07.434
, we wouldn't have language, we wouldn't have any

408
00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:07.884
of these things, you know, you and I

409
00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:11.233
, we wouldn't uh be able to talk to each

410
00:23:11.243 --> 00:23:11.814
other, you and I, we wouldn't have names

411
00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:15.594
, you know. So that is what, what

412
00:23:15.604 --> 00:23:18.664
my approach has been for for many years now.

413
00:23:18.973 --> 00:23:22.213
Um to say that the difference is that we humans

414
00:23:22.223 --> 00:23:25.674
, we are um we, we are able to

415
00:23:25.684 --> 00:23:27.574
copy, know how, even if there's no how

416
00:23:27.584 --> 00:23:30.713
it is super individual and we indeed do. And

417
00:23:30.723 --> 00:23:33.005
we have created all of this around us in this

418
00:23:33.015 --> 00:23:37.199
way. OK. So perhaps I could save this

419
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:40.318
question for later. But since you brought it already

420
00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:42.160
to the table, let's censor it now. So

421
00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:45.779
uh you mentioned there the question, I mean,

422
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:51.309
if other apes have some, some form of super

423
00:23:51.318 --> 00:23:56.719
individual know how uh I mean, what are examples

424
00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:59.009
of that. And I mean, what are examples

425
00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:02.949
of that where some people might claim that they in

426
00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:07.959
fact have that? Yes. So um here is

427
00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:10.299
it is an interesting approach. If you do the

428
00:24:10.309 --> 00:24:14.250
data approach, where you actually look systematically, what

429
00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:18.000
are these cases, you find actually a different answer

430
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.578
than when you ask people like that at a conference

431
00:24:21.588 --> 00:24:22.479
. For example, when II I do this kind

432
00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:23.858
of thing as well, I ask around, you

433
00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:26.318
know, I, I talk to people. So

434
00:24:26.328 --> 00:24:29.680
when I explain what I'm after and I explain,

435
00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:32.880
you know, I'm I'm after know how not know

436
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.539
where food is, not know what food is.

437
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:37.279
You know, this thing, whether it's that thing

438
00:24:37.618 --> 00:24:41.709
, we all know that apes can learn socially also

439
00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:42.838
about these things. When I say no, no

440
00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:45.880
, we are talking about know how more specifically not

441
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.799
know how that they can do on their own,

442
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.729
what my lab calls latent solutions. It doesn't matter

443
00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:52.630
what we call that, you know, let's stick

444
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.489
with this. Know how. So we are not

445
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.858
talking about this latent know-how, we are talking about

446
00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:00.689
super individual. When I explain all that, they

447
00:25:00.699 --> 00:25:03.868
give me answers such as OK. But then for

448
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.959
example, they would say, for example, Chimpanzee

449
00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:11.910
nut cracking would be uh one of these cases,

450
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.910
right? Chimpanzee nut cracking. Um I don't need

451
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.088
to explain, they use uh some hammers to crack

452
00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:18.969
, open some nuts, you know, very cool

453
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:21.430
behavior. Nobody denies that. But it's a question

454
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.348
is that a good idea, you know, to

455
00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:26.279
call that super individual, know how, in fact

456
00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:30.789
, um this is so convincing to most people per

457
00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:33.229
se per se without looking at the data that uh

458
00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:40.068
the United Nations have now uh started to protect Chimpanzee

459
00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:44.489
nutcracker. The United Nations protect Chimpanzee nut cracking.

460
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.509
The whole idea there is that this is they don't

461
00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.400
use these terms. But the whole idea is that

462
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.779
this is so human like that, this is super

463
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:55.500
individual. Know how that this is not know how

464
00:25:55.509 --> 00:25:59.368
that the apes would ever show unless they had developed

465
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.900
this culture around it. That's the idea, right

466
00:26:02.509 --> 00:26:03.459
? And again, nobody is saying that this is

467
00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:04.930
a stupid idea. You know, it's not a

468
00:26:04.939 --> 00:26:07.750
stupid idea. It's just a matter of does it

469
00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:11.519
actually fit the data? And so what we have

470
00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:15.578
done is we have given um uh orangutans in two

471
00:26:15.588 --> 00:26:21.289
different zoos orangutans untrained. So they were not trained

472
00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:23.150
to correct nuts, un incarcerated, you know,

473
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.059
so they were not, their cognition wasn't changed by

474
00:26:27.068 --> 00:26:30.150
human interaction. Maybe that's the shortest way I can

475
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.828
describe this, you know, they were left on

476
00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:36.739
their own and nobody showed them how to correct these

477
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.469
nuts, right? We asked the keepers, they

478
00:26:38.709 --> 00:26:41.430
promised us, you know that nobody showed them how

479
00:26:41.439 --> 00:26:45.180
to correct these nuts, right. Well, they

480
00:26:45.189 --> 00:26:47.680
crack nuts, they use an animals and they crack

481
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:52.769
nuts spontaneously, right? So orangutans don't even crack

482
00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:56.699
nuts in the wild. This would have been maybe

483
00:26:56.709 --> 00:27:00.469
the last remaining uh rescue hypotheses for the United Nations

484
00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:04.118
. Say when they say, oh, maybe they

485
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.318
, they learned it somehow we, because eventually,

486
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.618
if you go back long enough in time, eventually

487
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.469
some orangutans had to come from the wild, maybe

488
00:27:11.479 --> 00:27:14.828
they brought this knowledge along. No, you know

489
00:27:14.838 --> 00:27:15.608
, orangutans don't crack nuts in the wild, not

490
00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:18.039
that we know of anyway. And so we have

491
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:22.170
basically um uh an ape species very relevant because it's

492
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.680
an ape species, you know, they are all

493
00:27:23.689 --> 00:27:27.118
very closely related to each other and to us um

494
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.400
who didn't bring this knowledge from, there's no help

495
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.759
from the world who wasn't trained to show this knowledge

496
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:37.608
, who wasn't, you know, cognitively, um

497
00:27:37.618 --> 00:27:41.439
super enhanced by, by human incarceration. And we

498
00:27:41.449 --> 00:27:42.959
didn't show them how to do these things and yet

499
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.519
they take hammers and they crack nuts, right?

500
00:27:47.868 --> 00:27:52.779
So p definition is this is not super individual.

501
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:56.289
Nohow, by definition, it shows that the individuals

502
00:27:57.108 --> 00:28:00.199
could come up with this know-how. So this latent

503
00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:03.809
know-how, it's know how that they can come up

504
00:28:03.818 --> 00:28:07.529
with on their own. So exactly, unlike the

505
00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:10.088
example that I said earlier when I said nobody wakes

506
00:28:10.098 --> 00:28:11.108
up in the morning and just be able to speak

507
00:28:11.118 --> 00:28:14.880
Mandarin or, or Portuguese or, or whatever,

508
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.009
you know, that doesn't happen. But in a

509
00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:19.868
is it does happen that, you know, they

510
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.769
, they encounter the situation and as long as they

511
00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:26.000
are motivated. It's very important, motivated to actually

512
00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:29.660
eat these nuts. We, we tried this with

513
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.900
chimpanzees as well and they were not motivated to eat

514
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.489
the nuts. And of course, you can't study

515
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.750
it. But you know, if they are motivated

516
00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:37.390
, then um apparently they can do it, you

517
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.098
know, so the answer then that people give you

518
00:28:42.108 --> 00:28:45.160
what is super individual, know how in the apes

519
00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:48.809
you can then go and you test it in these

520
00:28:48.818 --> 00:28:51.439
ways. And we have done many, many such

521
00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:55.449
tests. And the overwhelming result from all these tests

522
00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:59.209
is that people make these claims, right? And

523
00:28:59.219 --> 00:29:00.949
the claim, nobody you know is fine to make

524
00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:04.420
this claim. But then you test it and we

525
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.479
showed many of these papers are still yet to be

526
00:29:07.489 --> 00:29:11.469
published. You know, uh we show that these

527
00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:15.029
kind of know how develop spontaneously in individuals. And

528
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:18.598
therefore it does not require the special human skill,

529
00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:22.289
it does not require the skill to copy. This

530
00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:26.539
is very important, the skill to copy super individual

531
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:30.828
know how instead all they need is uh being able

532
00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:33.469
to trigger each other's latent, know how they do

533
00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:36.509
that. But that's a different thing, right?

534
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:38.670
I can this is a bad example because it's a

535
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.719
hard wire behavior, but I can trigger you to

536
00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:45.160
yawn, you don't have to copy the know how

537
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:45.809
of the yawn from me, right? Just to

538
00:29:45.818 --> 00:29:48.989
give you an example that it happens in humans too

539
00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:52.739
, but it's very rare in the human case,

540
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.838
right? We don't, that's not usually the way

541
00:29:53.848 --> 00:29:56.348
that we work that we learn from each other.

542
00:29:56.358 --> 00:29:59.828
Right? But it is a typical way that the

543
00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:02.289
apes learn from each other. And, you know

544
00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:03.000
, yes, they, they, you have to

545
00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:06.390
have some social learning in the apes and it's clearly

546
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.789
is there otherwise they wouldn't have culture. Right.

547
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:11.809
So, um if you bring it all together apes

548
00:30:11.818 --> 00:30:14.650
have culture, yes, but their culture is different

549
00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.709
in the sense that they don't copy super individual,

550
00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:22.209
know how, which prevents logically, which prevents the

551
00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:26.939
cultural evolution of this. Know how, because if

552
00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:29.098
the apes, even if some ape comes up with

553
00:30:29.108 --> 00:30:30.368
a super great uh know how on their own.

554
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.078
Let's imagine an ape genius uh scenario. Let's just

555
00:30:34.088 --> 00:30:37.618
imagine this, this a genius comes up with a

556
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.289
super great super individual or maybe a techni technological way

557
00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:45.009
to crack nuts like 100 in an hour, you

558
00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:47.549
know, let's, you know, we humans do

559
00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:48.868
this kind of thing. So why not? You

560
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.618
know, so um this a genius comes up with

561
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:52.739
that, but if the other apes are unable to

562
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.410
copy super individual, know how they are not in

563
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.809
this example, they would not be geniuses. Well

564
00:30:59.818 --> 00:31:03.500
, the predictable outcome would be that this invention would

565
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:06.130
die with its maker. You know, all the

566
00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.170
others would do the kind of things that they are

567
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.170
able to do on their own again, a long

568
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.489
answer. But, but that is maybe the shortest

569
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.439
I can do for this question. Great. So

570
00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:19.719
uh before we move on to another topic, I

571
00:31:19.729 --> 00:31:22.979
mean, the questions I have asked you up till

572
00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:26.779
now that were mostly related to wild ape culture and

573
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:30.799
how similar or different it is to human culture.

574
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.739
I mean, of course, uh intellectually the I

575
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:40.848
guess these questions are very interesting but from the perspective

576
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:45.699
of someone who's trying to study and understand the culture

577
00:31:45.709 --> 00:31:49.858
, cultural evolution, why should we bother with these

578
00:31:49.868 --> 00:31:52.979
questions? I mean, why, why does it

579
00:31:52.989 --> 00:31:56.979
matter if wild ape culture is similar or different to

580
00:31:56.989 --> 00:32:01.209
human culture and if similar or different in what way

581
00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:06.098
, specifically, why should we bother with this question

582
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.769
? Um So generally speaking, I think what we

583
00:32:08.779 --> 00:32:13.199
are doing in all these cases is we are not

584
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:15.858
, we're not producing anything, you know, this

585
00:32:15.868 --> 00:32:17.769
is not, you know, this is not feeding

586
00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:21.689
humans on the planet or the answer to this question

587
00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:24.098
, right? So it's essential basic science, essentially

588
00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.729
basic science, but that we are doing here,

589
00:32:25.739 --> 00:32:29.568
we're just trying to understand systems. That's, that's

590
00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:31.568
what we do. And within that, I think

591
00:32:31.578 --> 00:32:35.769
we have got a couple of different approaches. I

592
00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:37.868
am, I am a biologist by training originally.

593
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.880
Now, I'm also an archaeologist, but I am

594
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.640
originally a biologist. And so for me, it's

595
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.959
just of general interest to find out how apes behave

596
00:32:46.969 --> 00:32:50.848
and uh what ape culture is where it comes from

597
00:32:50.858 --> 00:32:52.858
and, and so on and to describe it,

598
00:32:52.868 --> 00:32:54.769
you know, so that's generally interesting, but there

599
00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:58.338
are a couple of other things that are more broadly

600
00:32:58.348 --> 00:33:01.239
interesting. Um So for example, to, to

601
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.699
be able to talk about animal culture, generally,

602
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:09.170
we would need to study as many animal species as

603
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.989
possible. Some people now even claim that plants have

604
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.259
some social learning. So we would have to include

605
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:20.828
them in some general very general cultural category. So

606
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:22.680
apes then would be one part of this general puzzle

607
00:33:22.689 --> 00:33:25.549
that we should study everything that we can in an

608
00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:30.729
ideal world. But in addition to that, um

609
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.559
we can use this kind of knowledge, this hard

610
00:33:32.568 --> 00:33:37.828
gain knowledge in order to try to understand um cultural

611
00:33:37.868 --> 00:33:43.509
settings generally and cultural evolution generally and specifically for humans

612
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:45.789
. And here is where the apes of course play

613
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.689
very um large role. They play a large role

614
00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:52.789
because they are our closest living relatives. And so

615
00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:57.529
in addition to being of interest in and of themselves

616
00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.890
, they are highly, potentially highly uh phylogenetic informative

617
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:06.509
. Uh if we understand ape culture, it gives

618
00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:09.719
us a handle to have a likelihood, understanding a

619
00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:15.530
likelihood, understanding of uh the last common ancestor with

620
00:34:15.539 --> 00:34:17.168
apes. So if we find some patterns that are

621
00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:22.059
shared among all living apes today, chances are good

622
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.780
. Chances are good is the implication that the last

623
00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:30.280
common ancestor also shared in. It's not the perfect

624
00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:32.320
uh uh data set, right. Ideally, we

625
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:36.260
would have to have hundreds of living ape species that

626
00:34:36.269 --> 00:34:37.458
would be much better for this kind of influence.

627
00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.969
But it's the best that we have, you know

628
00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:42.869
, and, and so we should use it and

629
00:34:42.878 --> 00:34:45.628
then we can infer with a certain likelihood what the

630
00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:51.179
last common ancestor ancestors culture was like. And we

631
00:34:51.188 --> 00:34:52.809
can then build from that. And that is,

632
00:34:52.269 --> 00:34:54.789
that is my other area of research. But I

633
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.688
think we talked about that last time to a high

634
00:34:58.699 --> 00:35:02.478
uh degree. So I would be refer listeners interested

635
00:35:02.489 --> 00:35:06.789
in that what we are homing in our own past

636
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.510
ancestors, cultures like and so on that we,

637
00:35:08.519 --> 00:35:12.679
that we debated last time. So uh people could

638
00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:15.438
maybe listen to that then. Yes, of course

639
00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:15.840
. And as I said, at the beginning,

640
00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:20.059
I'm linking to our first interview in the description of

641
00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.648
this one. And by the way, just to

642
00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:24.780
clarify when you mentioned that a certain point there,

643
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:29.969
our last common ancestor with apes. Are you referring

644
00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:34.438
specifically to the last common ancestor? We have,

645
00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:38.349
we have with chimpanzees or going all the way back

646
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:44.389
to the one from which uh orangutans and gorillas also

647
00:35:44.398 --> 00:35:47.010
wrenched. I would, I would say the typical

648
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:50.409
way that people talk about it, the last common

649
00:35:50.418 --> 00:35:52.728
ancestor and they say it just like that and it's

650
00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:54.639
the last common ancestor we have together with the chimpanzees

651
00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:59.610
and the bonobos, right? Um But my lab

652
00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:01.550
has also been, again, I would refer to

653
00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:05.340
the last interview we did has also looked at all

654
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:07.329
the other apes and so on so forth. We

655
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.010
should really, ideally, we should look at all

656
00:36:10.019 --> 00:36:13.679
primates. Uh But uh you know, that's hard

657
00:36:13.688 --> 00:36:15.369
to do. It's, it's very difficult to get

658
00:36:15.378 --> 00:36:19.668
all the data for the apes. So another question

659
00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:25.570
, then there's this similarity hypothesis that people apply to

660
00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:28.949
the kinds of questions we've been talking about here.

661
00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:31.780
So what is the similarity hypothesis? And what are

662
00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:37.000
the types of claims that people have proposed in favor

663
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.429
of it? I think if you ask around us

664
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:44.239
the conferences, the the the the things that convinced

665
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.539
most people sometime in their Androgyny, you know,

666
00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:51.208
um many are convinced this is how I started too

667
00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:52.719
. I was convinced by the similarity of hypothesis in

668
00:36:52.728 --> 00:36:55.599
the beginning too. And then the data changed my

669
00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.260
mind, my own data uh changed my mind but

670
00:36:59.269 --> 00:37:04.418
also other people's data. Um So many people arrived

671
00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:07.199
there because they had heard this in school that all

672
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:10.978
primates of human like culture, sometimes this was just

673
00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:14.340
implicit by the teachers, you know, and then

674
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:16.340
people just pick it up in this way. Sometimes

675
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:20.280
it was said explicitly, I've asked some people a

676
00:37:20.289 --> 00:37:22.849
little bit about that, but many also arrived because

677
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.250
in public uh common media, imagine Attenborough and so

678
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.168
on. But of course, other people in wildlife

679
00:37:30.179 --> 00:37:32.340
documentaries and so on, the typical way that they

680
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:36.010
describe these things is that they say, yeah,

681
00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:37.610
yeah, this is all exactly like in the human

682
00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:40.628
case. And then of course, um, it

683
00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:44.449
looks also, I have to admit it looks at

684
00:37:44.458 --> 00:37:45.789
first it looks quite humanlike. Right. Um,

685
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.579
so why would people based on that, why would

686
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.699
they come away watching these things and hearing these things

687
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.978
? Why would they come away with a skeptical mindset

688
00:37:54.989 --> 00:37:58.039
? Right. There's absolutely no reason for that.

689
00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:00.260
But, and, and, and that's why I

690
00:38:00.269 --> 00:38:02.800
arrived at the scene, you know, uh like

691
00:38:02.809 --> 00:38:05.458
that, I, I believed, you know,

692
00:38:05.469 --> 00:38:09.909
that apes would have human like culture. Um So

693
00:38:09.958 --> 00:38:12.688
, you know, if you look at that just

694
00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:15.010
superficially, there is something already wrong with this uh

695
00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:20.800
approach because when you look even superficially at ape life

696
00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:22.688
and then human life even cross culturally, you do

697
00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:25.478
see differences, right? So there is a problem

698
00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:27.889
if you think about it like that, if you

699
00:38:27.898 --> 00:38:30.829
begin to actually compare with the human case, but

700
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.128
let's not, let's not go in this direction right

701
00:38:32.139 --> 00:38:37.199
now, a different direction is to basically say what

702
00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:42.010
we, the the main convincing things are that people

703
00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:45.300
see videos say of uh mother chimpanzee doing some things

704
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:49.360
and then often cut videos, you know, sometimes

705
00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.188
not even the same individual, but it can be

706
00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:55.159
the same individual uh later on these youngsters doing similar

707
00:38:55.168 --> 00:39:00.719
things, all right. Uh So that's very convincing

708
00:39:00.728 --> 00:39:04.000
to people, then I always point out yes.

709
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.489
But uh that is also the explanation that people had

710
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.610
in the past for um how birds learn to make

711
00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:14.840
their nests, they believe was that they always have

712
00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:16.869
to learn how to make their nest, how notice

713
00:39:16.878 --> 00:39:20.668
how, you know, they learn what material where

714
00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:22.360
this material is for sure. But the how,

715
00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:25.699
that's the question and uh the crucial uh studies there

716
00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:30.128
were done uh many years ago, Colas and Colas

717
00:39:30.458 --> 00:39:31.550
, for example, did a study on river bird

718
00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:35.764
nest making weaver birds are fantastic because they super fantastic

719
00:39:35.784 --> 00:39:37.253
. N you know, super great design, seemingly

720
00:39:37.264 --> 00:39:39.465
very complicated and so on. So what they did

721
00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:43.135
is they took an egg, the beauty with birds

722
00:39:43.144 --> 00:39:44.474
is that you can take them as an egg.

723
00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:45.905
They can't have seen anything, right? And then

724
00:39:45.914 --> 00:39:50.074
they raised these eggs outside of the view of any

725
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:52.878
nests, let alone nest making and then they ate

726
00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:57.070
it, you know, and uh these river birds

727
00:39:57.168 --> 00:40:00.139
completely naive to nest and nest making, they made

728
00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:05.050
the species typical nest and then, you know,

729
00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:07.199
people immediately get it, you know, they say

730
00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:08.369
, yeah, the, the logic is super clear

731
00:40:08.378 --> 00:40:12.659
here. We may have assumed that the birds have

732
00:40:12.668 --> 00:40:15.519
to copy how to make the nests. But these

733
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.878
kind of studies conclusively prove that they don't. Hm

734
00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:22.409
. And then I say, ok, now we

735
00:40:22.418 --> 00:40:25.300
talked about uh birds somehow, you know, birds

736
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:29.179
are much less emotional and the logic is much clearer

737
00:40:29.188 --> 00:40:31.139
to see, you know, let's go to this

738
00:40:31.148 --> 00:40:35.458
, unfortunately, very emotional case of the apes.

739
00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:37.579
And what if I were to tell you that,

740
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.099
you know, you see mother chimpanzee do something,

741
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:44.320
uh baby chimpanzee do something if we now remove this

742
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:45.619
knowledge, right? And they still do it.

743
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.969
And I, I told you about this one example

744
00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:51.148
in the orangutan case already, you know, they

745
00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:52.148
didn't have to see these kind of things. It's

746
00:40:52.159 --> 00:40:57.289
logically, it's the same structure in the river bird

747
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.809
case as in the orangutan nut cracking case, if

748
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.469
they can do these things on their own, it

749
00:41:02.478 --> 00:41:06.780
proves that the assumption that they have to copy these

750
00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:09.909
things was wrong, right? Um So that's,

751
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.418
that's essentially one aspect. But there are, there

752
00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:17.309
are two more I think. Um another is that

753
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.878
people point to uh to super rare behaviors. Uh

754
00:41:22.898 --> 00:41:24.570
And they say, look, you know, this

755
00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:27.989
is similar to the human case. We've got this

756
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:31.289
super rare behaviors only occurs here only occurs here in

757
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.059
this particular population of say chimpanzees. And again,

758
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.239
the intuition, we can, we can long discuss

759
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.119
why that is the case. But I don't need

760
00:41:40.128 --> 00:41:43.219
to because people have this intuition already. So I

761
00:41:43.228 --> 00:41:45.789
don't need to explain why that is actually not a

762
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.958
bad argument per se. Um But then we tested

763
00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:51.789
that. So um I A Motes Rodrigo, my

764
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.659
, my phd student at the time and I,

765
00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:55.849
we tested that and we looked at all these claims

766
00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:00.300
where people have said this kind of know how only

767
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:04.489
exists in this one population of one specific um species

768
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.610
of apes and we asked around and we look for

769
00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:09.300
the literature that came later. Uh if that is

770
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:13.849
actually the case and we found that in 99% of

771
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.590
cases that was not the case or 98% you know

772
00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:20.610
, was not the case. Instead these things did

773
00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:23.489
repeat someplace else. They, they, they,

774
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.860
that shows that this intuition, even though it was

775
00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:29.878
not a bad intuition, you know, it was

776
00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:32.168
actually not correct in, in the vast majority of

777
00:42:32.179 --> 00:42:37.458
cases, a know how repeats across different things.

778
00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:38.590
It pops up time and again. And then you

779
00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:42.039
have to explain why does it pop up time and

780
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.559
again. And our approach is to say, well

781
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.090
, because it is latently present anyway, right?

782
00:42:47.128 --> 00:42:52.052
And it requires certain conditions, um motivational issues,

783
00:42:52.061 --> 00:42:54.811
environmental conditions, et cetera, et cetera, tiny

784
00:42:54.822 --> 00:43:00.143
details to then create different patches of these cultures everywhere

785
00:43:00.262 --> 00:43:04.322
. That's cultural. Let's let's be very clear about

786
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:06.811
this, but it's different cultural from the human case

787
00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:09.492
because we culturally evolve our know how on top of

788
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:12.211
this, you know, very different uh approach.

789
00:43:12.824 --> 00:43:15.364
Oh yeah. And uh and lastly, I think

790
00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:17.436
what many people are also convinced of is when they

791
00:43:17.445 --> 00:43:21.016
see, for example, let's say uh in a

792
00:43:21.025 --> 00:43:23.655
Hollywood movie these days, luckily Hollywood does a lot

793
00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:25.465
of CG I for apes and so on. But

794
00:43:25.476 --> 00:43:28.885
in the past, they would have a trained ape

795
00:43:28.894 --> 00:43:30.416
and that ape would act say very human like,

796
00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:36.559
right? And then they, this the number of

797
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.000
people who came to this belief because of these kind

798
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.239
of images goes down, I think, but they

799
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.340
still exist. And so they basically then say,

800
00:43:46.159 --> 00:43:50.050
uh look, I've seen apes act like humans.

801
00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:51.869
What are you, what are you talking about?

802
00:43:51.878 --> 00:43:53.878
Claudio, I've seen apes look like humans and act

803
00:43:53.889 --> 00:43:57.208
like humans. So they must have copied it from

804
00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.000
humans. And that is not true. We can

805
00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:04.239
, we can make a bear ride a motorcycle in

806
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.719
circles. It's not that I would do this,

807
00:44:05.728 --> 00:44:08.340
but we can. But that doesn't mean that why

808
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:13.599
natural bears ride motorcycles, right? So we have

809
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:17.458
to keep separate, trained behavior and going even further

810
00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:21.739
, we have to keep separate and incarcerated apes that

811
00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:23.269
you know, that are very special, incarcerated apes

812
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:27.239
are a special case. They are again irrelevant for

813
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.239
the aggression of wild ape cultures. But it's much

814
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.378
harder to see why they are irrelevant for this case

815
00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:39.760
. But uh why should we study un inculturated and

816
00:44:39.769 --> 00:44:45.000
untrained apes? What kind of information can we get

817
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.550
from them? So the again, the trained,

818
00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:50.688
the trained apes, if we, if we were

819
00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:52.849
to train a dog, say, uh if we

820
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.208
were to train a dog to not like meat,

821
00:44:57.398 --> 00:45:00.329
let's just make it very simple. It's not about

822
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.188
know how this is about, know what, know

823
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:04.769
what to eat, but it doesn't matter for now

824
00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:07.329
, then it's very easy to see that this is

825
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:14.429
not representative anymore for wolves. Why would wolves not

826
00:45:14.438 --> 00:45:16.039
like me, right. So if you were to

827
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.929
take, of course, dogs are uh domesticated animals

828
00:45:20.938 --> 00:45:22.349
, we can use a non-domestic animal with a similar

829
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.570
logic. It's easy enough to do. So let's

830
00:45:24.579 --> 00:45:28.469
just stick with the dogs. Um So if we

831
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:31.148
were to make them train them not to do something

832
00:45:31.559 --> 00:45:34.849
, we can do that, right? Uh But

833
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:40.969
that is not um relevant for extrapolating what wild animals

834
00:45:40.978 --> 00:45:44.389
would be doing. This is just one example,

835
00:45:44.398 --> 00:45:47.409
but they, the one generalizes, we can train

836
00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:52.070
animals generally via clicker training. I've done this myself

837
00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.128
, you know, uh all kinds of race.

838
00:45:53.269 --> 00:45:58.550
Um We can do that and they perform things including

839
00:45:58.559 --> 00:46:00.250
even if we want to know how we can make

840
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:04.179
a dog done salsa, right? Uh We can

841
00:46:04.188 --> 00:46:06.898
do, we can install, know how in them

842
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.550
that would never come about in wild animals. That

843
00:46:12.559 --> 00:46:15.188
means that we need to exclude all of these cases

844
00:46:15.199 --> 00:46:19.179
where we train the, know how into these animals

845
00:46:19.188 --> 00:46:22.539
. Because the question is not, is decidedly not

846
00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:25.019
, can for example, an ape, can an

847
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:29.780
ape, can an ape show some human know how

848
00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:32.329
that question is a different question, that question we

849
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.708
can answer yes because for example, we can train

850
00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:39.489
them to our question here is different. Our question

851
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:46.938
is can a spontaneously copy super individual nohow, copy

852
00:46:47.228 --> 00:46:50.418
and spontaneous, you know, these, these are

853
00:46:50.429 --> 00:46:52.458
the two things that we have to have in place

854
00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:55.429
because if they are not spontaneous. Um And if

855
00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:58.898
it's not copying, then this is not what we

856
00:46:58.909 --> 00:47:00.019
are really after. You know, that's, that's

857
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.289
what we are after here. Oh, yeah.

858
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.989
And with the incarceration, the incarceration is a little

859
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.489
bit complicated. So bear with me a little bit

860
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:14.099
. Ok. Um There are two general, two

861
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:19.648
general approaches to explaining why we humans have special social

862
00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:23.070
learning abilities. So just so, you know,

863
00:47:23.159 --> 00:47:25.280
yes, I'm, my research group is a little

864
00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:29.539
bit special that we talk about, know how copying

865
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.929
supervision, know how copying. So we specify it

866
00:47:30.938 --> 00:47:34.769
like that. But we are by no means alone

867
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.148
in saying that humans have some special social learning abilities

868
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:43.409
. Others focus focus much more detailed on imitation and

869
00:47:43.418 --> 00:47:45.000
so on. We think this is too, too

870
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:45.750
focused, you know, but it doesn't matter.

871
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.898
So we are not the only ones that say humans

872
00:47:47.909 --> 00:47:52.219
have got special social learning abilities, good. Keep

873
00:47:52.228 --> 00:47:54.179
that in mind. So now when we say there

874
00:47:54.188 --> 00:47:58.199
was a whole class of social learning American that's special

875
00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:01.139
. Let's even not say what they are. Then

876
00:48:01.148 --> 00:48:05.309
there are two general approaches to this, how we

877
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.050
humans got to have these special social learning. One

878
00:48:08.059 --> 00:48:12.739
approach is to say they are adaptations, they are

879
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.139
natural adaptations. We have them in our genes essentially

880
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.800
. Again, I'm painting with a very broad product

881
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.679
. These people will then say, well, we

882
00:48:21.688 --> 00:48:27.918
are born with these skills or we are born um

883
00:48:27.929 --> 00:48:30.369
in a way that makes us have these skills very

884
00:48:30.378 --> 00:48:34.378
, very, very likely, you know, OK

885
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:36.360
, again, broad brush, let's not go into

886
00:48:36.369 --> 00:48:39.000
detail uh here. But there was this other approach

887
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:43.030
where people say yes, genes play a little bit

888
00:48:43.039 --> 00:48:44.889
of a role, but they play only a small

889
00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:46.550
role and they play an enabling role. They pro

890
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:52.039
provide a small platform on which we build these skills

891
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.559
and the skills themselves, these special skills, they

892
00:48:54.570 --> 00:49:00.039
are built into us socially. They are built into

893
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:05.659
us by culture itself. Very unintrusive idea. Basically

894
00:49:05.668 --> 00:49:08.260
what these people say at the forefront of this old

895
00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:13.119
movement right now is uh Cecilia Hayes. What these

896
00:49:13.128 --> 00:49:17.840
people are saying is we culturally learn how to culturally

897
00:49:17.889 --> 00:49:22.059
learn. OK. So why am I, why

898
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.039
am I mentioning this? You will know this anyway

899
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.398
, but I'm mentioning this because if that is true

900
00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:29.679
, let's just assume for this moment that this is

901
00:49:29.688 --> 00:49:30.199
true. This is the correct way. Let's just

902
00:49:30.208 --> 00:49:38.280
assume then humans themselves learn these things culturally. And

903
00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:42.239
if we learn this thing culturally, it stands to

904
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:45.559
reason that perhaps the ways in which we transmit these

905
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:52.809
skills, we could apply these skills and make other

906
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:58.708
species have these skills too that we can find soft

907
00:49:58.719 --> 00:50:02.639
means to install again, broad brush, install in

908
00:50:02.648 --> 00:50:07.329
their brains, completely new skills, new abilities,

909
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:14.369
including new abilities to culturally learn. Uh And indeed

910
00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.228
, it seems to be, you know, this

911
00:50:15.239 --> 00:50:17.610
does not mean that this whole approach of the CD

912
00:50:17.628 --> 00:50:22.119
A is is completely correct. Although these days,

913
00:50:22.128 --> 00:50:24.030
I tend to believe that maybe it is right,

914
00:50:24.679 --> 00:50:28.300
but it certainly is in favor of this approach that

915
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:30.648
we see that if we train, if we put

916
00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:31.889
our minds to it, if we put our intentions

917
00:50:31.898 --> 00:50:35.208
behind it, if we apply everything that we can

918
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:40.000
to make apes copy, nohow, we succeeded.

919
00:50:40.728 --> 00:50:45.739
We can, we can make them different apes,

920
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:47.769
we can change them, we can cognitively change them

921
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.820
. We install something new in their brains that they

922
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:55.659
wouldn't otherwise have. That's the other implication. And

923
00:50:55.668 --> 00:50:59.398
that is what happens intentionally or not. You know

924
00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:01.898
, it depends on the study uh when we incarcerate

925
00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:08.590
apes. Now, that means then because no ape

926
00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:12.208
is running around in the wild and no human is

927
00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:15.269
running around in the wild, inculturated apes. And

928
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.610
this is not the case now and this hasn't been

929
00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:21.820
the case in any time in the evolutionary past of

930
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:25.360
apes that we need to exclude. This is just

931
00:51:25.369 --> 00:51:28.760
very, very simple logic. We need to exclude

932
00:51:28.769 --> 00:51:34.570
this incarcerated apes um from our equation. They cannot

933
00:51:34.579 --> 00:51:37.228
provide the answer. They are interesting if you want

934
00:51:37.239 --> 00:51:38.378
to study the whole approach of C VA and so

935
00:51:38.389 --> 00:51:40.199
on. They're very interesting, you know, for

936
00:51:40.208 --> 00:51:44.269
these other reasons. But if we want to understand

937
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.300
what, why apes have and what, you know

938
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:50.840
, how they make their cultures and by implication,

939
00:51:50.849 --> 00:51:52.614
what our last common answer that uh we must fully

940
00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:57.784
exclude uh incarcerated apes. That's why I whenever I

941
00:51:57.793 --> 00:52:00.704
absolutely can. I try not to study incarcerated apes

942
00:52:00.715 --> 00:52:02.534
. You know, the only time when we do

943
00:52:02.543 --> 00:52:06.844
is if they are intermixed with un incarcerated apes and

944
00:52:06.853 --> 00:52:08.925
then we hope that the un incarcerated apes come first

945
00:52:08.934 --> 00:52:12.704
and test first. You know, then it's interpretable

946
00:52:12.715 --> 00:52:15.224
. If the incarcerated apes do it first, then

947
00:52:15.235 --> 00:52:19.320
it's uninterpretable. Ok. So, uh I mean

948
00:52:19.329 --> 00:52:21.349
, I wasn't planning on asking you about this,

949
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.909
but since you mentioned Cecilia Hayes there, I've had

950
00:52:23.918 --> 00:52:29.199
an interview with her in 2019. And so I

951
00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:30.619
, I can't really avoid asking you this now.

952
00:52:30.628 --> 00:52:35.175
So uh I would like to ask you more about

953
00:52:35.543 --> 00:52:39.175
what do you think about her approach to culture?

954
00:52:39.184 --> 00:52:43.063
I mean, to what extent, but at this

955
00:52:43.074 --> 00:52:46.094
point in time, would you agree or disagree with

956
00:52:46.103 --> 00:52:51.389
her proposals and her claims? And if she,

957
00:52:51.398 --> 00:52:54.340
if she was correct, what do you think would

958
00:52:54.349 --> 00:53:00.438
be the implications in terms of how we approach culture

959
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:07.320
from an evolutionary sl slash phylogenetic perspective? Because I

960
00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:12.378
mean, wouldn't that change the game uh to some

961
00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:15.780
extent because there, there, there are people.

962
00:53:15.873 --> 00:53:16.751
Uh I, I mean, and I'm not saying

963
00:53:16.762 --> 00:53:21.652
they are wrong but uh when it comes to how

964
00:53:21.663 --> 00:53:25.211
culture evolved, uh they tend to think about particular

965
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:30.822
uh cognitive mechanisms as having to be set in place

966
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:34.893
in a particular species for it to be able to

967
00:53:35.282 --> 00:53:39.751
either uh have culture entirely or not, or to

968
00:53:39.762 --> 00:53:46.094
be able to have specific kinds of culture or cultural

969
00:53:46.105 --> 00:53:51.405
manifestations like language, for example, right? Uh

970
00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:52.094
But I, but I mean, I, if

971
00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:58.565
she was correct, wouldn't that have a big impact

972
00:53:58.574 --> 00:54:01.715
on how we think about culture, particularly from a

973
00:54:01.726 --> 00:54:06.688
biological perspective? Several people in the past, I

974
00:54:06.699 --> 00:54:08.449
had proposed that this whole idea of having all these

975
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:14.199
modules in the brain uh being evolved separately and so

976
00:54:14.208 --> 00:54:16.128
on, it, it doesn't really work because we

977
00:54:16.139 --> 00:54:19.898
don't have, this is actually an argument made by

978
00:54:19.909 --> 00:54:22.168
Mike to Marcelo in his 99 book, The Cultural

979
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:27.239
Origins of Human Cognition. So Mike went a long

980
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.289
way in a similar direction as as Hayes, but

981
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:34.688
he actually stopped short only of uh for a few

982
00:54:34.699 --> 00:54:37.099
stops, let's say, um he said his argument

983
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.840
was we don't have much time, uh evolutionarily speaking

984
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:43.909
, if we look at archaeology and so on uh

985
00:54:43.918 --> 00:54:47.019
to explain the human condition. And so this is

986
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:51.570
just not very convincing that we would have enough time

987
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:53.260
to have all these modules installed in our brain.

988
00:54:53.559 --> 00:54:58.159
There are the reasons why this was always a little

989
00:54:58.168 --> 00:55:00.969
bit dubious and Hayes just, just, I mean

990
00:55:00.978 --> 00:55:04.500
, she did a wonderful job, she went some

991
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.849
steps further and she said, OK, uh where

992
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.708
Mike said, we have some adaptations such as he

993
00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:13.938
focused on imitation, a sub form of, of

994
00:55:13.949 --> 00:55:17.539
know how copying fine uh general perfect direction. Um

995
00:55:19.409 --> 00:55:22.829
uh Haman said, even that even that has a

996
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:27.019
cultural origin, right? Uh And, and in

997
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.550
her book, and in her B BS paper and

998
00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:35.320
so on. She listed quite convincing data sets and

999
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:37.789
I'm sure you talked about that in the interview.

1000
00:55:37.059 --> 00:55:40.800
It's quite convincing the case that the cultural learning of

1001
00:55:40.809 --> 00:55:45.820
cultural learning is the thing in humans. But for

1002
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:47.438
my own approach, just because this is important for

1003
00:55:47.449 --> 00:55:50.050
, for, for me here as well. For

1004
00:55:50.059 --> 00:55:52.958
my own approach, it doesn't really matter if there's

1005
00:55:52.969 --> 00:55:55.139
no how copy this super individual, know how copying

1006
00:55:55.148 --> 00:56:00.639
if we humans get the genetically broadly speaking or culturally

1007
00:56:01.489 --> 00:56:05.728
, as long as we have it, right?

1008
00:56:05.739 --> 00:56:08.728
So my approach is mute on where it came from

1009
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.280
it. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but

1010
00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:15.519
it's for all current purposes is mute on where it

1011
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:21.070
came from. Um uh As long as it's there

1012
00:56:21.079 --> 00:56:23.128
and as long it is as it is uh meaningfully

1013
00:56:23.139 --> 00:56:27.119
link to all these phenomenon here. And I think

1014
00:56:27.128 --> 00:56:30.829
it is uh then um you know, that that

1015
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.300
approach still works because in either case, I would

1016
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:37.519
say in either case, you have this missing in

1017
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:44.869
the, you don't really see the signature signal that

1018
00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:49.320
super individual know how copying would have led to in

1019
00:56:49.329 --> 00:56:52.648
wild a culture, right? And we don't see

1020
00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:57.449
super individual know how copying spontaneously either. So putting

1021
00:56:57.458 --> 00:56:59.820
it all together, you know, it doesn't matter

1022
00:56:59.829 --> 00:57:02.429
where we humans have it from what seems to be

1023
00:57:02.438 --> 00:57:07.340
a factor that apes don't have it at all or

1024
00:57:07.639 --> 00:57:08.958
they have it to such a low degree or so

1025
00:57:08.969 --> 00:57:13.789
or show it so rarely that it really doesn't translate

1026
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.889
in special types of culture that would be similar to

1027
00:57:15.898 --> 00:57:19.644
the human spec type of culture that we have here

1028
00:57:19.655 --> 00:57:22.414
, right? Um I should also say that maybe

1029
00:57:22.425 --> 00:57:25.434
there are other species that can copy super individual,

1030
00:57:25.445 --> 00:57:28.675
know how you know in some domains, some people

1031
00:57:28.684 --> 00:57:30.554
talk about whale song copying, you know, in

1032
00:57:30.563 --> 00:57:34.614
a super individual area, there is there was some

1033
00:57:34.625 --> 00:57:37.054
debate around that too. But be that as it

1034
00:57:37.063 --> 00:57:38.494
may here, we are talking about the apes,

1035
00:57:38.715 --> 00:57:44.175
right? And they are the phylogenetic uh meaningful comparison

1036
00:57:44.429 --> 00:57:45.909
. And whenever we looked, uh we could not

1037
00:57:45.918 --> 00:57:49.789
find these kind of things in the apes. OK

1038
00:57:50.168 --> 00:57:52.978
. So um let me ask you now about uh

1039
00:57:52.989 --> 00:57:58.179
another kind of questions. So uh we've already mentioned

1040
00:57:58.188 --> 00:58:01.449
a few times during the interview uh social learning.

1041
00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:06.110
So and of course to study ape social learning,

1042
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:09.250
people use different kinds of tasks. And the question

1043
00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.668
I would like to ask you is do you think

1044
00:58:12.679 --> 00:58:15.610
that the tasks that are commonly used to study ape

1045
00:58:15.619 --> 00:58:21.510
, social learning are suitable? Yes. Yeah,

1046
00:58:21.519 --> 00:58:23.679
I mean suitable for what? Right. I have

1047
00:58:23.688 --> 00:58:29.458
to be quite blunt here. Um My blunt reaction

1048
00:58:29.469 --> 00:58:34.418
would be to say they are claimed to be suitable

1049
00:58:34.429 --> 00:58:37.349
for certain purposes, the kind of purposes that we

1050
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.510
talk about today in this interview. And I think

1051
00:58:39.519 --> 00:58:45.260
for that purpose, they prove to be unsuitable.

1052
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:46.780
Um Let me, let me explain a little bit

1053
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:51.340
. The main task that is being used. Um

1054
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:52.969
The main task that is being used is the so

1055
00:58:52.978 --> 00:58:58.019
called um, two target task. It's essentially a

1056
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:00.829
task you can imagine. Uh if, if we

1057
00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.079
have a box here and this is a box here

1058
00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.809
and then there is a, there is a door

1059
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.019
and the door can be pulled open, it can

1060
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.458
be pushed over, right. So you push it

1061
00:59:08.469 --> 00:59:10.019
, you get the food inside, you pull it

1062
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:14.628
, you get the and then one group of Apes

1063
00:59:14.639 --> 00:59:16.300
sees the the pushing, you know, another group

1064
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:20.820
of Apes sees the pulling and then people say,

1065
00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:23.199
uh oh, and the result is frequently, not

1066
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:25.809
always, but frequently. Yes. The ones that

1067
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.469
saw the pushing, they, they do the pushing

1068
00:59:29.478 --> 00:59:30.530
and the ones that saw the pulling, they do

1069
00:59:30.539 --> 00:59:34.878
the pulling good. And but, but then on

1070
00:59:34.889 --> 00:59:37.019
this level, there is no disagreement. I've done

1071
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:38.168
these tasks myself. And, you know, sometimes

1072
00:59:38.179 --> 00:59:40.878
I find I found this too. So the phenomenon

1073
00:59:40.889 --> 00:59:45.989
is not a question, the interpretation and the interpretation

1074
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.329
is that some people, first of all, they

1075
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:52.030
then claimed we are looking at action, copy,

1076
00:59:52.039 --> 00:59:54.208
at the behavior copy. But that can't be true

1077
00:59:54.219 --> 00:59:55.929
because for example, here, you know, I

1078
00:59:55.938 --> 00:59:58.929
can make it so that you don't even see my

1079
00:59:58.938 --> 00:60:00.918
actions and these things move. In fact, that

1080
00:60:00.929 --> 00:60:02.949
was a point that Celia Hayes made in, I

1081
00:60:02.958 --> 00:60:07.030
think in the nineties. But apart even from that

1082
00:60:07.159 --> 00:60:08.918
, apart, even from that, there is a

1083
00:60:08.929 --> 00:60:13.349
bigger problem here. The bigger problem is that people

1084
00:60:13.360 --> 00:60:17.610
then thought doing these tasks. Um we find special

1085
00:60:17.619 --> 00:60:21.800
types of learning, special types of learning that we

1086
00:60:21.809 --> 00:60:23.139
only find in the human case. And that explain

1087
00:60:23.148 --> 00:60:27.519
all of the human culture here. Now, that's

1088
00:60:27.530 --> 00:60:30.320
a huge problem because it turns out that not just

1089
00:60:30.340 --> 00:60:35.840
humans and not just apes copy in these tasks,

1090
00:60:36.750 --> 00:60:38.760
dogs copy in these tasks. OK? Then you

1091
00:60:38.769 --> 00:60:42.199
might say dogs are domesticated and so on, you

1092
00:60:42.208 --> 00:60:45.659
know, but recently, uh also reptiles copy in

1093
00:60:45.668 --> 00:60:49.429
these tasks, right? So if you want to

1094
00:60:49.438 --> 00:60:53.269
take this task performance and these two target tasks as

1095
00:60:53.280 --> 00:60:55.510
a special way of learning, you have got a

1096
00:60:55.519 --> 00:61:00.188
problem because then you would expect reptiles. I have

1097
00:61:00.199 --> 00:61:01.139
nothing against reptiles, you know, but you don't

1098
00:61:01.148 --> 00:61:02.739
just see it, you, you don't see it

1099
00:61:02.869 --> 00:61:06.539
, then you would expect reptiles to have humanlike culture

1100
00:61:06.550 --> 00:61:08.099
too. That really is the key. That is

1101
00:61:08.110 --> 00:61:10.128
the first hint that, you know, we have

1102
00:61:10.139 --> 00:61:13.349
been barking up the wrong tree with these tasks.

1103
00:61:13.360 --> 00:61:15.280
I can say that because I've done these tasks myself

1104
00:61:15.289 --> 00:61:16.898
, right? So I think it's, it's fair

1105
00:61:16.909 --> 00:61:20.329
if I, if I say this done this task

1106
00:61:20.340 --> 00:61:22.648
myself and I think we, we have, we

1107
00:61:22.659 --> 00:61:25.300
have been doing the wrong thing there. The other

1108
00:61:25.309 --> 00:61:30.489
big big clue is the empirical finding that if you

1109
00:61:30.500 --> 00:61:32.300
look whether the apes, in this case, the

1110
00:61:32.309 --> 00:61:36.840
apes, if they can pull the door open on

1111
00:61:36.849 --> 00:61:38.969
their own without having seen it pulled open or if

1112
00:61:38.978 --> 00:61:43.619
they can push the door open without having seen the

1113
00:61:43.628 --> 00:61:45.918
door being pushed open, not just the door of

1114
00:61:45.929 --> 00:61:49.599
the board removal, leber movements. You know,

1115
00:61:49.610 --> 00:61:51.829
there are different versions of these cars. In all

1116
00:61:51.840 --> 00:61:53.648
cases. We've done a review on that together with

1117
00:61:53.659 --> 00:61:57.250
Lydia Hopper and Carl Von SYK. Um, we've

1118
00:61:57.260 --> 00:62:00.510
done a review and we found, well, actually

1119
00:62:00.000 --> 00:62:02.418
, uh as you might imagine because they don't sound

1120
00:62:02.429 --> 00:62:06.510
very difficult these tasks, actually, the apes can

1121
00:62:06.519 --> 00:62:08.849
just solve these tasks in all of these ways on

1122
00:62:08.860 --> 00:62:12.469
their own. This is of importance for the current

1123
00:62:12.478 --> 00:62:15.250
interview as well because as I said earlier, we

1124
00:62:15.260 --> 00:62:20.139
what we need to find is know how copying that

1125
00:62:20.148 --> 00:62:22.688
is the copying of, know how that is super

1126
00:62:22.699 --> 00:62:25.398
individual. So we are back to the same kind

1127
00:62:25.409 --> 00:62:30.164
of um learning in these cases that we already talked

1128
00:62:30.175 --> 00:62:32.155
about when we talked about the orangutan not cracking.

1129
00:62:32.164 --> 00:62:36.543
If you can potentially develop this, know how on

1130
00:62:36.554 --> 00:62:38.003
your own. Anyway, then all you need is

1131
00:62:38.014 --> 00:62:42.313
know how triggering you need triggering of know how that

1132
00:62:42.324 --> 00:62:45.784
is latently already there. That's very different from copying

1133
00:62:45.793 --> 00:62:49.813
, know how that you could not produce on your

1134
00:62:49.824 --> 00:62:52.625
own. So for this reason, these two target

1135
00:62:52.635 --> 00:62:53.583
tasks and there are many, many of them and

1136
00:62:53.594 --> 00:62:57.530
so on, you know, for this purpose,

1137
00:62:57.878 --> 00:63:00.539
they, they just don't work, they work for

1138
00:63:00.550 --> 00:63:02.739
other purposes. Uh People are very interested in so-called

1139
00:63:02.750 --> 00:63:06.610
social learning biases and so on this is like the

1140
00:63:06.619 --> 00:63:08.760
traffic lights for, for social learning under which circumstance

1141
00:63:08.769 --> 00:63:12.530
to your social learning. That's fine. Absolutely.

1142
00:63:12.539 --> 00:63:14.369
You can use these tasks for that. You know

1143
00:63:14.474 --> 00:63:16.583
, there is very nice uh papers by Rachel Candle

1144
00:63:16.594 --> 00:63:19.253
and others and so on. Very nice. You

1145
00:63:19.264 --> 00:63:21.614
can do that. But for the current purpose,

1146
00:63:21.625 --> 00:63:22.434
you know, human like culture and so on,

1147
00:63:22.704 --> 00:63:25.155
um it turned out empirically, you cannot, you

1148
00:63:25.164 --> 00:63:29.375
know, uh you can design maybe better tasks uh

1149
00:63:29.385 --> 00:63:30.735
that, that, you know, the the animals

1150
00:63:30.744 --> 00:63:34.175
cannot solve on their own. Um But you would

1151
00:63:34.184 --> 00:63:37.043
have to make sure in these tasks that they are

1152
00:63:37.054 --> 00:63:38.860
about, know how not about no, where,

1153
00:63:38.869 --> 00:63:42.789
no, what and so on. So again,

1154
00:63:42.800 --> 00:63:44.369
as always, the devil is in the detail.

1155
00:63:44.378 --> 00:63:45.659
I told you at the very beginning, culture is

1156
00:63:45.668 --> 00:63:49.898
a slippery concept and it becomes even more slippery when

1157
00:63:49.909 --> 00:63:52.500
you make these distinctions. But I would argue we

1158
00:63:52.510 --> 00:63:54.679
have to make these distinctions otherwise we don't get it

1159
00:63:54.688 --> 00:63:57.679
, you know, the distinctions between human and ape

1160
00:63:57.688 --> 00:64:01.269
culture. And so what would be in your opinion

1161
00:64:01.280 --> 00:64:08.349
, suitable tasks to studying ape social learning? Yes

1162
00:64:08.360 --> 00:64:13.648
. So this task exists. Um The first was

1163
00:64:13.659 --> 00:64:16.228
done by uh by a consortium of, of researchers

1164
00:64:16.239 --> 00:64:18.860
. Um Michael Marcelo was there, Joseph Cole was

1165
00:64:18.869 --> 00:64:21.309
there as well. And what they did is they

1166
00:64:21.418 --> 00:64:28.228
essentially they um made some chimpanzees learn new begging gestures

1167
00:64:28.840 --> 00:64:31.469
. Mhm Translated into this interview in, in uh

1168
00:64:31.478 --> 00:64:34.878
one would say they taught, they taught, they

1169
00:64:34.889 --> 00:64:38.320
trained them, they trained them, you know,

1170
00:64:38.329 --> 00:64:40.769
this is not to be confused with copying these,

1171
00:64:40.780 --> 00:64:43.320
these animals didn't copy Mike and just happen. And

1172
00:64:43.329 --> 00:64:45.070
the others, you know, they train these animals

1173
00:64:45.090 --> 00:64:49.010
to show, you know how to beg from humans

1174
00:64:49.019 --> 00:64:53.300
, know how good. And uh and then uh

1175
00:64:53.309 --> 00:64:57.648
I think 18 observer chimpanzees saw this new, know

1176
00:64:57.699 --> 00:65:00.128
how be being used as a begging gesture, you

1177
00:65:00.139 --> 00:65:03.340
know, and what happened is uh these uh these

1178
00:65:03.349 --> 00:65:08.079
observers saw it and every time this uh train chimpanzees

1179
00:65:08.090 --> 00:65:10.228
would use this new begging gesture, they would get

1180
00:65:10.239 --> 00:65:12.699
food. It was a perfect begging gesture, you

1181
00:65:12.708 --> 00:65:15.409
know, from the perspective of these observers. Now

1182
00:65:15.418 --> 00:65:17.659
, did any of these observers copy this new know-how

1183
00:65:17.668 --> 00:65:20.619
, including I think one son of one of the

1184
00:65:20.628 --> 00:65:23.918
demonstrators, you know, so it's, it's exactly

1185
00:65:23.929 --> 00:65:27.500
this mother uh kid relationship that we always see uh

1186
00:65:27.510 --> 00:65:30.030
in these wild shows, you know, no,

1187
00:65:30.309 --> 00:65:32.280
not a single one of them copied uh any of

1188
00:65:32.289 --> 00:65:35.010
these know hows, right? So these, these

1189
00:65:35.019 --> 00:65:39.054
are suitable, you make them ideally, you make

1190
00:65:39.063 --> 00:65:41.405
it so that you've got a large baseline. You

1191
00:65:41.414 --> 00:65:43.675
, you check really if they show any of this

1192
00:65:43.684 --> 00:65:46.543
uh no how on their own spontaneously. And then

1193
00:65:46.554 --> 00:65:49.103
if they don't, you train them to show that

1194
00:65:49.114 --> 00:65:53.003
and you show this to others. And I myself

1195
00:65:53.014 --> 00:65:55.594
have because I always thought this is exactly the kind

1196
00:65:55.603 --> 00:65:57.304
of study that we need. This is the gold

1197
00:65:57.313 --> 00:66:00.414
standard study. So my group uh we have done

1198
00:66:00.425 --> 00:66:02.925
a couple of these studies and overall, I think

1199
00:66:02.934 --> 00:66:06.340
we have now tested, I, I wanna say

1200
00:66:06.349 --> 00:66:10.688
over 100 apes different species, you know, all

1201
00:66:10.699 --> 00:66:15.090
general actually. And um in no cases, in

1202
00:66:15.099 --> 00:66:18.019
no cases, did we find any time any super

1203
00:66:18.030 --> 00:66:21.780
individual know I copy? This is very strong evidence

1204
00:66:23.228 --> 00:66:27.599
that our hypotheses that we held uh was always correct

1205
00:66:27.610 --> 00:66:29.679
. Right. Um Or let me, let me

1206
00:66:29.688 --> 00:66:31.639
, let me put it so that it's easier digestible

1207
00:66:31.648 --> 00:66:34.958
. Maybe for, for those still skeptical, given

1208
00:66:34.969 --> 00:66:39.418
that we tested, I think over 100 chimpanzees uh

1209
00:66:39.429 --> 00:66:43.159
oh no, over 100 apes of different general and

1210
00:66:43.168 --> 00:66:45.628
that none of them ever copied super individual know how

1211
00:66:45.679 --> 00:66:49.668
in a technical domain in a non-technical domain uh from

1212
00:66:49.679 --> 00:66:55.590
, from aid demonstrators from human demonstrators and majority conditions

1213
00:66:55.599 --> 00:66:58.199
. So several showed them, you know, uh

1214
00:66:58.219 --> 00:67:00.070
in all kinds of ways. And given that we

1215
00:67:00.079 --> 00:67:03.969
never found any super individual know our copying, not

1216
00:67:03.978 --> 00:67:09.188
it, it supports the view that if apes have

1217
00:67:09.199 --> 00:67:15.510
supervision or copy they applied either super rarely, right

1218
00:67:15.708 --> 00:67:18.599
? Or are very weakly. This is of high

1219
00:67:18.610 --> 00:67:21.989
importance because all the cultural evolution models show that you

1220
00:67:23.000 --> 00:67:27.550
need a certain threshold level of both the frequency,

1221
00:67:27.559 --> 00:67:30.159
the reliability of the social learning and the strength of

1222
00:67:30.168 --> 00:67:32.949
this social learning. So said in this way,

1223
00:67:32.958 --> 00:67:35.869
even if they sometimes very rarely do this, it

1224
00:67:35.878 --> 00:67:40.349
just wouldn't be enough to have them have this kind

1225
00:67:40.360 --> 00:67:43.789
of human culture that we humans have right. So

1226
00:67:43.800 --> 00:67:45.849
that is, that is, I think a strong

1227
00:67:45.860 --> 00:67:47.320
statement that we can make with the data that we

1228
00:67:47.329 --> 00:67:53.300
have at hand right now. OK. And so

1229
00:67:53.780 --> 00:67:59.559
what can we tell from those data then? Because

1230
00:67:59.570 --> 00:68:03.059
I would imagine that uh one claim that someone could

1231
00:68:03.070 --> 00:68:06.019
make, could make is something like, OK.

1232
00:68:06.030 --> 00:68:12.820
So then does this all mean that uh apes do

1233
00:68:12.829 --> 00:68:18.279
not socially learn and they do not and cannot have

1234
00:68:18.289 --> 00:68:21.930
culture? I mean, I is that a plausible

1235
00:68:21.939 --> 00:68:26.208
claim to make it is not a plausible claim?

1236
00:68:26.220 --> 00:68:29.729
I have said extremely explicitly. I think in the

1237
00:68:29.739 --> 00:68:33.399
last uh paper uh I said apes, I think

1238
00:68:33.409 --> 00:68:36.770
I quote myself correctly here. Apes have culture and

1239
00:68:36.779 --> 00:68:40.750
nobody denies this. I could not say it more

1240
00:68:40.759 --> 00:68:43.838
strongly, right? Apes have culture. Nobody denies

1241
00:68:43.850 --> 00:68:45.949
this. Nobody I know denies this. But what

1242
00:68:45.958 --> 00:68:50.779
we need is a pluralistic approach to culture. Not

1243
00:68:50.789 --> 00:68:54.770
all cultures are created equal, right? And so

1244
00:68:54.939 --> 00:68:58.539
apes have many different types of culture. They have

1245
00:68:58.548 --> 00:69:00.338
very, we know this securely. They have cultures

1246
00:69:00.350 --> 00:69:03.417
of know what to eat. Maybe they would even

1247
00:69:03.429 --> 00:69:05.639
starve if they wouldn't have this culture, know what

1248
00:69:05.648 --> 00:69:08.868
to eat. It's very strong in that they learn

1249
00:69:08.877 --> 00:69:10.917
socially what to eat, you know, from those

1250
00:69:10.929 --> 00:69:12.559
around them, from their mothers and so on.

1251
00:69:12.889 --> 00:69:14.828
That's a, that's a culture, but it's a

1252
00:69:14.837 --> 00:69:16.948
different culture, but they clearly have it. They

1253
00:69:16.957 --> 00:69:19.618
also have got to know where cultures, where to

1254
00:69:19.627 --> 00:69:23.337
be, you know, and they also quite surely

1255
00:69:23.349 --> 00:69:25.707
know their territory and so on, you know,

1256
00:69:25.719 --> 00:69:29.198
so they socially learn that too. So they've got

1257
00:69:29.207 --> 00:69:31.068
all kinds of cultures, but when it comes to

1258
00:69:31.078 --> 00:69:35.563
know how their culture is basically uh uh about no

1259
00:69:35.573 --> 00:69:39.684
le and know how that they trigger. In each

1260
00:69:39.693 --> 00:69:41.863
case. Uh I use this term, by the

1261
00:69:41.873 --> 00:69:44.894
way from Dan Sperber, he made this very useful

1262
00:69:44.903 --> 00:69:47.163
distinction between the stuff that is already kind of there

1263
00:69:47.172 --> 00:69:50.443
and just needs triggering and the stuff that really needs

1264
00:69:50.453 --> 00:69:54.542
copying. And um Andrew Bask and I, we

1265
00:69:54.554 --> 00:69:57.804
have recently worked on that to lay more detail in

1266
00:69:57.813 --> 00:69:59.363
, in that it's a, it's a paper and

1267
00:69:59.373 --> 00:70:01.418
press, I think you recently interviewed Andrew as well

1268
00:70:01.479 --> 00:70:04.509
. So um so that that difference is very,

1269
00:70:04.520 --> 00:70:08.270
very important when it comes to know how the know

1270
00:70:08.279 --> 00:70:12.350
how is triggered but not copied in the sense that

1271
00:70:12.359 --> 00:70:14.619
we have been talking about this year. But in

1272
00:70:14.628 --> 00:70:17.088
order in order to have all of these things and

1273
00:70:17.100 --> 00:70:20.149
language, you know, and many other subdomains of

1274
00:70:20.159 --> 00:70:25.000
human culture, we need know how copy and without

1275
00:70:25.009 --> 00:70:26.560
it, we we, we cannot get that.

1276
00:70:26.569 --> 00:70:30.259
So um I would even say it like this apes

1277
00:70:30.270 --> 00:70:31.850
have many types of culture, but they do not

1278
00:70:31.859 --> 00:70:34.810
seem to share in this special type of culture that

1279
00:70:34.819 --> 00:70:40.220
we humans have and maybe other species have maybe whales

1280
00:70:40.229 --> 00:70:43.079
and all right. But I would also say that

1281
00:70:43.088 --> 00:70:45.560
this also doesn't mean that humans have all types of

1282
00:70:45.569 --> 00:70:48.970
possible culture that is also not the case bats,

1283
00:70:48.979 --> 00:70:51.878
for example, they communicate in ranges that we can't

1284
00:70:51.890 --> 00:70:55.180
communicate in. So, you know, we wouldn't

1285
00:70:55.189 --> 00:70:57.239
have this kind of uh culture if, if the

1286
00:70:57.250 --> 00:71:00.134
bats have special types culture based on that, right

1287
00:71:00.284 --> 00:71:01.963
? So you need to always look what kind of

1288
00:71:01.975 --> 00:71:04.864
cultures do these species show. And we see that

1289
00:71:04.875 --> 00:71:08.543
there is a difference in the kinds of cultures that

1290
00:71:08.555 --> 00:71:11.125
apes and humans show just like there was a difference

1291
00:71:11.134 --> 00:71:14.583
between uh different other kinds of animals in the cultures

1292
00:71:14.595 --> 00:71:17.020
that they show. OK. So with all of

1293
00:71:17.029 --> 00:71:19.668
that in mind, I have one last question then

1294
00:71:19.850 --> 00:71:25.298
. So we've talked about uh differences or potential differences

1295
00:71:25.310 --> 00:71:29.529
and similarities between ape culture and human culture. A

1296
00:71:29.539 --> 00:71:34.128
a different kind of question and related one is where

1297
00:71:34.140 --> 00:71:40.470
do those differences come from? Yes. Uh Well

1298
00:71:40.479 --> 00:71:43.628
, Ricardo, uh this is the million dollar question

1299
00:71:43.899 --> 00:71:46.409
and um and I don't think we have a very

1300
00:71:46.418 --> 00:71:49.500
good answer to that yet, you know. So

1301
00:71:49.509 --> 00:71:55.109
I think there is some good answers maybe more convincing

1302
00:71:55.229 --> 00:71:57.850
uh to some than to others, to all the

1303
00:71:57.859 --> 00:72:00.640
other questions that you had. Um But for this

1304
00:72:00.649 --> 00:72:04.060
one, we are quite in the dark yet.

1305
00:72:04.509 --> 00:72:08.168
I have argued and I might have used the same

1306
00:72:08.180 --> 00:72:10.859
argument in the last interview that we did. Um

1307
00:72:10.869 --> 00:72:13.128
I have argued in the past that in order to

1308
00:72:13.140 --> 00:72:15.869
try to shed light on this particular question, why

1309
00:72:15.878 --> 00:72:18.378
we got the way that we got? And so

1310
00:72:18.390 --> 00:72:23.149
on, we should first answer the question. When

1311
00:72:23.279 --> 00:72:26.180
did we go the way that we got first?

1312
00:72:26.319 --> 00:72:29.989
And if we have a good understanding of when we

1313
00:72:30.000 --> 00:72:31.779
became like that, then uh we can look at

1314
00:72:31.789 --> 00:72:34.668
the circumstances that acted at the time and at the

1315
00:72:34.680 --> 00:72:38.739
time, directly preceding it. And that is ultimately

1316
00:72:38.750 --> 00:72:42.128
the reason why even though I was a psychologist and

1317
00:72:42.140 --> 00:72:45.168
a biologist before, um that now I still maintain

1318
00:72:45.180 --> 00:72:48.199
these directions, but that I'm now an archaeologist.

1319
00:72:48.208 --> 00:72:51.298
So now I'm I'm trying to understand this when this

1320
00:72:51.310 --> 00:72:57.259
is my, my current quest as great. So

1321
00:72:57.270 --> 00:73:00.100
, Doctor 10, uh as I said at the

1322
00:73:00.109 --> 00:73:02.329
beginning, I'm also leaving a link in the description

1323
00:73:02.338 --> 00:73:05.489
box to our first interview. Uh Would you like

1324
00:73:05.500 --> 00:73:09.890
to mention again where people can find you and your

1325
00:73:09.899 --> 00:73:13.250
work on the internet? So uh if you Google

1326
00:73:13.259 --> 00:73:15.449
my name or it will, the things that pop

1327
00:73:15.458 --> 00:73:16.579
up will be the Google scholar account. Of course

1328
00:73:16.659 --> 00:73:19.649
, my, my website would be probably uh currently

1329
00:73:19.659 --> 00:73:21.418
the best place. It's a, it's a Google

1330
00:73:21.430 --> 00:73:24.750
site as well and, and easy to find.

1331
00:73:24.759 --> 00:73:26.958
