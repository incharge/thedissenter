00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:02.859
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.759
the Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lops

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.050
. And today I'm joined by Dr Alva Noe.

4
00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.439
He's professor and Chair of Philosophy at the University of

5
00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.579
California Berkeley. He is the author of many books

6
00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.818
. And today we're talking about his latest one,

7
00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.458
the entanglement, how art and philosophy make us what

8
00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.158
we are. So, Doctor Noah, welcome to

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.199
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone. Thank

10
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:31.760
you very much for inviting me. So the first

11
00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.079
question I would like to ask you is um since

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.779
you are, I guess we could say mostly a

13
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.990
philosopher of mind, what got you interested also in

14
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.798
art and what is art for you and how do

15
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.200
you approach it in the book specifically? Yeah.

16
00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you very much. That's, that's in a

17
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.918
way the uh it's both a personal question about me

18
00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.219
, but in some ways, it really gets us

19
00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:00.380
right to the very heart of the book. Um

20
00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:03.558
There's different ways I can answer it. Um One

21
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.168
is that sort of biographically, my first book was

22
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.400
called action and Perception. And the central theme of

23
00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.870
action and perception was the idea that that um the

24
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.430
best sort of, by a lot, the best

25
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.489
biological way to think about perceptual consciousness is as something

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.638
that the animal accomplishes or achieves and that it does

27
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.948
so against the background of its situation and the environment

28
00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.689
for humans, that also means the cultural environment.

29
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.829
Um So this sort of idea which is sometimes called

30
00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:42.219
an uh the the inactive approach to perception, places

31
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.359
great emphasis on um the animal's embodiment and the animal's

32
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.168
skills or the person's embodiment and the person's skills um

33
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.079
perception isn't something that happens inside of us. It's

34
00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:59.888
something we do. And to my um great surprise

35
00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:05.689
, I received a lot of um responses to the

36
00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:08.000
book from people working in the arts, especially people

37
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:14.618
working in the performing arts, dancers, uh choreographers

38
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.199
, but not only dancers and choreographers, also painters

39
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.399
and sculptors and, and other kinds of artists.

40
00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:23.368
Um And they all were in sort of interested as

41
00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.699
, as a community they were interested in, in

42
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.199
seeing what my approach to perception offer them, how

43
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.229
it supported their understanding of their own work. But

44
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.649
I immediately became interested in these conversations with the question

45
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.368
. Well, what, what do they have to

46
00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.169
teach me about the phenomenon that interests me, what

47
00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.229
are they doing anyway? What is, what is

48
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.610
this work of, of, of artists? What

49
00:02:51.618 --> 00:02:54.088
is, is it, are they just making decorations

50
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.879
? Are they making pretty things? Are they?

51
00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.020
I mean, what, what are, what are

52
00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:00.439
they doing especially since they take themselves very seriously.

53
00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:05.580
And uh uh and we take the arts very seriously

54
00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:07.338
. So this got me interested in the question,

55
00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.649
what is, what is art and what is the

56
00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.528
source of its value? And my, my first

57
00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.659
attempt to explore that was in my book, Strange

58
00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.399
Tools, which was published at the very end of

59
00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.278
2015 Strange Tools, subtitle Art and Human Nature.

60
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.129
Um And in that book, I really asked the

61
00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.629
question, what is our, what, why does

62
00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.069
it matter to us and what does the fact that

63
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.449
it matters to us? Tell us about ourselves?

64
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.278
Mhm. Um The, the current book, um

65
00:03:37.288 --> 00:03:42.960
the Entanglement goes way beyond uh Strange Tools and it's

66
00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.278
been kind of a, a transformative experience for me

67
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:53.149
writing it. Um But um to come back to

68
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.270
your, your question, you can think about the

69
00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:05.008
question, what is art kind of anthropologically? Mhm

70
00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.028
. Um Or if you like philosophically and, and

71
00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.149
the contrast I have in mind there is in one

72
00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.819
sense, we all know what art is, we

73
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.770
can just refer to it. There's, there's painting

74
00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:16.869
and there's music and there's film and there's dance and

75
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:23.108
there's pottery and there's um you know, installation art

76
00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:24.928
and I'm, I'm forgetting one, I'm sure.

77
00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.769
But, but art is this specific set of making

78
00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:32.420
activities that preoccupy human beings pretty much everywhere and pretty

79
00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:38.338
much always. Um So there's a, there's probably

80
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.108
if you think of art in terms of those collections

81
00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:43.858
of, of things that we do playing the drums

82
00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:46.220
, playing the flute, writing novels, with all

83
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.778
of all of that is art. There's probably not

84
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.949
any straightforward way of, of uh defining what art

85
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.858
is. It's just simply, it's all of that

86
00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:56.899
. And so that's what I mean by an anthropological

87
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.670
approach. You just kind of we all kind of

88
00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:00.660
know roughly what we're talking about when we're talking about

89
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.660
the arts. Um Can you go deeper, can

90
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.889
you say something more, more um profound about what

91
00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.358
art is, why it, why it matters to

92
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.579
us? And I think you can um I'll tell

93
00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:19.720
you my bottom line, but in a way how

94
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.470
you get to the bottom line is the more interesting

95
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.678
question. I think that art is uh art,

96
00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.769
arts, the arts are practices and their practices through

97
00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:40.209
which we reorganize ourselves. And even I would go

98
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.600
so far as to say, liberate ourselves from the

99
00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:53.488
habits and other systems of organization, cultural, biological

100
00:05:55.338 --> 00:06:00.608
, emotional linguistic that in some sense, hold us

101
00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:01.629
captive. And I mean, I could say one

102
00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.790
more thing about that. Um You know, the

103
00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:09.470
thing is one of the beautiful things about art and

104
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.910
what makes art puzzling is that on the face of

105
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.980
it materially speaking, it really looks no different from

106
00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:25.689
other forms of technological manufacture and making, you know

107
00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.819
, um people make things I make, you know

108
00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:31.649
, somebody manufactured this glass of water. Um the

109
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.108
, the pen, the computer, the telephone the

110
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.230
systems that we're using right now, the clothes that

111
00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:39.790
we're wearing all of this is made and art is

112
00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:42.309
just more stuff that we make. So, one

113
00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.209
of the interesting questions is how does the making,

114
00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.639
the dedicated dedication to making in the sphere of art

115
00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.858
differ from the dedication to making in the sphere of

116
00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:03.250
manufacture or industry or technology? And um answering that

117
00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.108
question is the key. Mhm So you mentioned many

118
00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:12.139
different things there and we'll certainly get through them in

119
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:15.048
our conversation. But uh the question I have now

120
00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:20.009
is then art is much more than, at least

121
00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:24.298
in your perception, much more than uh than just

122
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:29.879
a cultural curiosity. As many people would probably think

123
00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.088
of it. Right. Right. I guess there

124
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.088
, there would be a view according to which,

125
00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.290
you know, there's the important, the really important

126
00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:41.319
things in life, food and security and shelter.

127
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:46.439
And um and only once a society gets to a

128
00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:47.670
certain stage of security and wealth, do you have

129
00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:50.470
time for art? Art is this kind of,

130
00:07:51.048 --> 00:07:55.009
it's an extra, it comes, it comes after

131
00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.369
and you can do without it. No, the

132
00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.358
view that I try to develop in this book,

133
00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:07.139
the arguments I make is that there is nothing which

134
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:09.139
is recognizably a human form of life that doesn't have

135
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:22.009
art. And that's because art is um in some

136
00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:26.009
ways, I want to say it's both and a

137
00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:30.980
response to the human condition and a precondition of the

138
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:37.700
human condition. Um We, we make art to

139
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.690
, to cope with the challenges of our own existence

140
00:08:43.538 --> 00:08:48.769
. But art then changes the character of our own

141
00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:52.389
existence. Um And this, by the way,

142
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:56.940
a phrase that I use throughout the book is II

143
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.418
, I speak of the entanglement of life and art

144
00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:01.558
and in a way this is the kind of the

145
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:09.658
core thought there art starts from life. Mhm By

146
00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:11.558
that, I, I don't mean that art is

147
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.408
about life in a kind of semantic sense. Some

148
00:09:16.418 --> 00:09:18.119
artist, I make a picture of you and then

149
00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:20.580
it's about you and it's about something I experienced in

150
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.359
my living world. Um But I mean, something

151
00:09:24.369 --> 00:09:30.149
more like we make art out of life or life

152
00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:35.239
gives art its raw materials. But the very act

153
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.119
of bringing those raw materials into focus in the way

154
00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:43.649
that art lets us do gives us resources. This

155
00:09:43.658 --> 00:09:45.788
is I'm speaking very abstractly now I can give examples

156
00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:48.369
later but gives us ex example, gives us resources

157
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:56.979
for living differently so that we make art out of

158
00:09:56.989 --> 00:09:58.639
life. But then life becomes something new in an

159
00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:03.979
art world and then art becomes something new given that

160
00:10:03.989 --> 00:10:05.359
the change in life and you get a kind of

161
00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:11.548
historical circular pattern of making and remaking and making and

162
00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:18.070
remaking. Um where we face a kind of almost

163
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:24.750
paradoxical conclusion, which is that um we are somehow

164
00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:28.229
by nature bound up with art. But by that

165
00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:33.168
very fact alone, it's no longer quite appropriate to

166
00:10:33.178 --> 00:10:35.479
speak of our nature at all because our nature is

167
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:39.779
changing. Um And there's even a sense in which

168
00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:43.928
a AAA rigorous meaningful sense in which we are ourselves

169
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.298
artworks. So could you give us perhaps some examples

170
00:10:50.308 --> 00:10:56.849
of how that entanglement between life and art plays out

171
00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:03.609
? Yeah. Um I'll give you two. I

172
00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:05.279
discuss a number of different examples in the book,

173
00:11:05.288 --> 00:11:07.558
but I'll give you, I'll give you two right

174
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.940
now. Um One is a kind of fairly straightforward

175
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:24.288
one. Um tick tick dancing, it's tempting to

176
00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:26.629
think of dancing as a sort of a natural human

177
00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:31.639
capacity. Um or at least it seems to be

178
00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:35.149
universal in human societies and, and if you think

179
00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:41.889
about dancing, it um it serves all sorts of

180
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.320
psychological slash anthropological functions. People dance at weddings or

181
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.219
funerals or they dance in clubs and when they dance

182
00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:54.548
at clubs, it's partly social and it's about communication

183
00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:56.080
and maybe about courtship or about, you know,

184
00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:00.460
romance or it can dance. Dance can be many

185
00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:03.190
, many different things, but it's always something it's

186
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.879
dancing is always bound up with needs. Dancing is

187
00:12:05.889 --> 00:12:09.849
also very interesting because it's um it, when people

188
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:13.219
dance, whether in a club or at a party

189
00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:18.639
, they feel um they get caught up in the

190
00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:22.369
dancing, the dancing has a kind of bodily entrainment

191
00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:24.058
to it. You, you, you, you

192
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.788
don't, you don't dance in a deliberate controlled way

193
00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:28.210
if you dance. Well, at all, you

194
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:31.719
let the dance just happen and you just move,

195
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.779
you let the the demands of the situation, the

196
00:12:33.788 --> 00:12:37.070
partner of the music they govern you. So dance

197
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.928
is a very interesting, a cognitively, extremely interesting

198
00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:43.369
thing that people do. Um But now what about

199
00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.609
the art of dancing? What about choreography, the

200
00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:48.928
kind of thing that happens on the stage, right

201
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.558
? Well, choreography is, I would say it's

202
00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.298
dancing severed from the way in which it's ordinarily embedded

203
00:13:00.308 --> 00:13:03.479
in our lives. Um The dancers on the stage

204
00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:05.298
are not wooing, they're not courting, they're not

205
00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:09.609
um they're not. Well, what they're doing is

206
00:13:09.619 --> 00:13:13.129
an interesting question. But one of the, one

207
00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:13.469
of the things that I would say about what they're

208
00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:18.830
doing is that they're putting, they're displaying dancing itself

209
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:22.048
. There's this thing we do, it's called dancing

210
00:13:22.058 --> 00:13:22.440
. And then the, the art, the art

211
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.798
dancers are putting that thing. We do itself on

212
00:13:24.808 --> 00:13:28.739
the stage and saying this is dancing and so in

213
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.989
effect, they're putting us on the stage as people

214
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.869
who are habitually culturally organized by dancing. Um So

215
00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:45.658
I, I see a difference between dance. Sometimes

216
00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.690
I say dance with a capital D and dancing.

217
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.798
Mhm Dancing is embedded in our culture and our psychology

218
00:13:52.808 --> 00:13:56.519
and our economy of living dance is this kind of

219
00:13:58.149 --> 00:14:01.849
representation of this thing that we do when we're dancing

220
00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:07.960
. But the image that dancing gives us, excuse

221
00:14:07.969 --> 00:14:11.418
me, the image that choreography gives us that dance

222
00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:13.928
with the capital D gives us of what we do

223
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.849
when we're dancing then becomes a template or a model

224
00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:22.418
or even a kind of score for how to dance

225
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.668
. So that how we spontaneously dance you or I

226
00:14:26.678 --> 00:14:31.418
when we're at a party or celebration or in a

227
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.979
nightclub ends up being influenced by the art of dance

228
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:41.190
. But then the art of dance is concerned with

229
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.399
the way in which dancing organizes us and our lives

230
00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:46.548
. So the art of dance will then be influenced

231
00:14:46.558 --> 00:14:50.599
by the changes in the way we dance. And

232
00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:54.928
so you get a kind of a loop of the

233
00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:00.469
representation of dancing, altering dancing and dancing, giving

234
00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:03.349
rise to new pictures or models or templates or scores

235
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:09.690
of what dancing can be. No, you might

236
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.408
think. Yes. Well, there's the kind of

237
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:15.109
natural phenomenon of dancing at the core and then there's

238
00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:16.369
this kind of cultural play that has happened on top

239
00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.269
of it. But those are now in tango,

240
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:22.489
they cannot really any longer be disentangled except in thought

241
00:15:24.609 --> 00:15:26.639
. Now what it is to be a human being

242
00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:30.639
who dances is to be a human being whose sense

243
00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:33.190
of what it is they're doing has been made available

244
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.149
to them through art over long periods of time.

245
00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:43.719
So dance and dancing, art and life have become

246
00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:48.649
inextricably entangled. And this is something we live each

247
00:15:48.658 --> 00:15:50.869
of us individually. In the first person, you

248
00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:54.200
know, you watch, I talk in the book

249
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.830
. But I imagine a little girl dancing by herself

250
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.639
in a room to music. What she's doing is

251
00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:06.580
is informed by a whole set of ideas and images

252
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.908
about what she's doing. This is called dancing.

253
00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:11.009
Dancing looks like this. This is not dancing.

254
00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:15.149
That that's something else. This is how one dances

255
00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:17.869
, this is how dancing looks to other people.

256
00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:19.178
So that there's an interesting way that the girl might

257
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.668
just think, oh, put on the music and

258
00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:22.590
dance. No thought at all. But in an

259
00:16:22.599 --> 00:16:30.158
interesting way, I think she embodies or incorporates a

260
00:16:30.168 --> 00:16:36.129
whole art history which, which is not ever finished

261
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:47.200
. So that's one example. Um Now that's another

262
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:56.119
another example um is um it, it's, it's

263
00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:59.158
actually slightly more complicated. Um But I'll see if

264
00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:00.580
I can get a simple version of it and we

265
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.379
can get into complications if we need to. But

266
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:06.920
um if I show you a photograph of my son

267
00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:08.380
, this is my kid. It's on my Facebook

268
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.739
page. It's in my fa family photo album here

269
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.309
. This is my son. My, my photograph

270
00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:19.409
is functioning, I believe as a tool or instrument

271
00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:22.448
for display. It's serving a playing a role in

272
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:26.818
the communication. I'm letting you see something, I'm

273
00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:33.900
showing you something I'm framing um a kind of extension

274
00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:37.680
. This is the Edinburgh Castle, you know,

275
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:41.880
or this is what the uh lounge looks like at

276
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.229
the Lisbon airport. We use pictures to show and

277
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:48.939
we use pictures to show for all sorts of reasons

278
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.828
. I can go online and buy a coat,

279
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.219
looking at the pictures of the coat and I can

280
00:17:55.229 --> 00:17:56.380
zoom in and zoom out or choose this color or

281
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.019
that color. Look at this model. Is that

282
00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:02.180
model or every week I get in the mail from

283
00:18:02.189 --> 00:18:04.009
my supermarket. The, the, the latest deals

284
00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:07.049
on chicken and broccoli and there's pictures, there's pictures

285
00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:10.650
of chicken, there's pictures of broccoli pictures function in

286
00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.189
a kind of social economy of communication. Now,

287
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:15.759
I think actually there's a very interesting set of questions

288
00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:21.088
there about how depiction works, how pictures work and

289
00:18:21.098 --> 00:18:22.189
I have ideas about that. But, but what

290
00:18:22.199 --> 00:18:27.209
I'm interested now is the fact that when I make

291
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:34.199
, when I make an art picture, I'm no

292
00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:41.939
longer just playing the game of showing you something because

293
00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:44.779
the interesting thing about an art picture and this is

294
00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:47.880
analogous to the dancing situation. The interesting thing about

295
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.118
an art picture is there is no one right way

296
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.969
to see it. There is no one thing it

297
00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:55.949
is showing. It doesn't have a caption that exhausts

298
00:18:55.959 --> 00:19:00.160
what it is of it. It, it resists

299
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:07.309
um being reduced to a function. It has no

300
00:19:07.449 --> 00:19:11.049
, there is no user manual that tells you what

301
00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:11.489
it is or how to use it or how to

302
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.858
make sense of it. The what the picture does

303
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:21.068
the eye picture is, it takes itself as a

304
00:19:21.078 --> 00:19:26.608
picture and extracts it from the cultural communicative background against

305
00:19:26.618 --> 00:19:33.618
which pictures normally have a depict function. And thus

306
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.799
it throws you the person looking at this work of

307
00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:42.469
art back on yourself to interrogate yourself about the role

308
00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:48.098
that ordinary non art pictures have in your life.

309
00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:53.098
Um How pictures shape what we think it is to

310
00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:56.380
look at something or how pictures shape what it is

311
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.180
we think to show something or how pictures affect our

312
00:20:02.189 --> 00:20:04.029
, our feelings about other people or how we use

313
00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:07.979
pictures in different ways than we use in person viewing

314
00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:08.818
. So all of a sudden this work of art

315
00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:18.489
has the capacity to what seen and being seen and

316
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.410
looking and showing and the role these play the meaning

317
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:27.088
these have in our lives themselves on display. Just

318
00:20:27.098 --> 00:20:30.199
as the choreographer puts dancing on display, the the

319
00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:33.358
picture puts all the different things that pictures can mean

320
00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:37.509
for us or the things that are depicted can mean

321
00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:40.380
for us. Like how I feel about the one

322
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.750
depicted, my daughter or God, how, how

323
00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:47.088
do we process what we see? And the work

324
00:20:47.098 --> 00:20:51.900
of art then gives us an opportunity. Um The

325
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.160
picture gives us an opportunity if you like to uncover

326
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.519
the place of pictures in our lives. Um And

327
00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:07.559
that then in turn, I believe changes. So

328
00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.789
what we take for granted about pictures in our lives

329
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.279
and lets us have different and new attitudes, not

330
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:17.559
just to pictures, but also to seeing or to

331
00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:21.890
showing or to communicating with pictures and thus you get

332
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.078
an entanglement of the art of pictures in our lives

333
00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:26.650
with pictures. And when you, when you remind

334
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.769
yourself that we've been making and using pictures to show

335
00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:34.009
since prehistoric times, the claim I would make is

336
00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:38.219
that our very conceptions, I, I don't say

337
00:21:38.229 --> 00:21:42.549
concept are very conceptions of what seeing is and visual

338
00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:47.269
life is, have been made and remade through picture

339
00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:49.858
making practices and in particular art making practices with pictures

340
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:52.750
over and over and over and over again. It's

341
00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:56.959
another example. So then, and this starts to

342
00:21:56.969 --> 00:22:00.670
get very exciting for a philosopher because now you come

343
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.578
along and you're a cognitive scientist and you want to

344
00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:03.588
study vision and you think that there is this fixed

345
00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:08.170
stable thing called seeing? Mhm But do we actually

346
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:17.449
know what seeing is independently of that generative work of

347
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.640
re understanding what we're doing when we see that is

348
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:27.328
shaped in part by pictorial? And so give,

349
00:22:27.348 --> 00:22:32.809
given what you're what you just said there. Uh

350
00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:38.400
how does that all tie to questions surrounding human nature

351
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.229
? First of all, I guess what is human

352
00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:45.088
nature? Because many times when we use that term

353
00:22:45.368 --> 00:22:51.269
, people are referring to something like um some sort

354
00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:56.500
of innate psychology that we are born with something that

355
00:22:56.509 --> 00:23:02.779
is unchangeable, something that is sometimes probably the result

356
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:07.670
of our evolutionary history. But in this particular case

357
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.269
, by adding art and then later on, we'll

358
00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:15.979
also get into philosophy, what kind of picture.

359
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:22.420
Do we get about how we should understand human nature

360
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.160
? This is the hardest question. Um because it's

361
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.338
not, it's not that I really want to deny

362
00:23:29.348 --> 00:23:33.469
human nature. It's that I want us to recognize

363
00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:44.289
the always already already problematic nature of human nature.

364
00:23:44.848 --> 00:23:48.828
And in particular, I want to say that human

365
00:23:48.838 --> 00:23:52.189
nature is an aesthetic problem. And let me see

366
00:23:52.199 --> 00:23:56.880
if I can explain that. OK. Um I

367
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.420
mean, I mean, actually, first of all

368
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.828
, as a preliminary for your, for your audience

369
00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:02.529
, I should say, and this is this,

370
00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:04.118
I think is not an original idea to me.

371
00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:11.338
Um And is not um even all that controversial anymore

372
00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:18.529
. Um I think we all recognize how human life

373
00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:25.489
is scaffolded by culture and technology. Um We,

374
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.140
we can do things you and I not because we're

375
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.170
so smart, but because we are members of a

376
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.279
community that gives us the instruments to do it.

377
00:24:37.489 --> 00:24:38.910
So we don't catch our own food, we don't

378
00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:42.939
make our own clothing, we don't um solve our

379
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:48.420
own survival problems. We, we rest on um

380
00:24:48.949 --> 00:24:53.719
a, an existing network of knowledge and technology that

381
00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:56.809
lets us be the way we live. And this

382
00:24:57.019 --> 00:25:00.000
, you know, this goes down to very profound

383
00:25:00.009 --> 00:25:03.750
levels. Um We use writing and language to think

384
00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:06.709
with. So our very cognitive powers are, are

385
00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:11.358
extended uh as the image goes through um through technology

386
00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:17.229
. Um So, in some sense, we already

387
00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:22.009
know that human nature is the stuff of change and

388
00:25:22.019 --> 00:25:25.509
evolution because all of this is evolving and changing.

389
00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:30.779
Um In fact, if you, if you think

390
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:36.910
of leading sort of accounts of human evolutionary origins,

391
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:45.880
what seems clear is that most of the primary mutations

392
00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:52.469
responsible for modern Homo SAPIEN were done a few 100,000

393
00:25:52.479 --> 00:25:56.390
years ago at least. Um So all the stuff

394
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.479
that we've made since then, language, dress,

395
00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:04.088
culture, communication, all of that can't be explained

396
00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:07.529
just with reference to the mutations, that stuff that

397
00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:11.328
has been done through collectives of, of this particular

398
00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:15.618
ape that we are over, over time. So

399
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:22.140
, um so already we're, we're at a step

400
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.118
of removal from a certain kind of naive biological reductionism

401
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.289
on any I think persuasive conception of the human mind

402
00:26:30.449 --> 00:26:36.400
and the human life. Um What I believe is

403
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:48.239
further the case is that human beings resist the ways

404
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:55.108
they find themselves organized by habit, organized by technology

405
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.380
, the technology we speak of technology. But what

406
00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:02.709
is a technology? A tool is just the physical

407
00:27:02.719 --> 00:27:07.848
component of a suite of ability, skills, practices

408
00:27:07.118 --> 00:27:11.549
, techniques, habits. So if I can write

409
00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:12.858
with a pen, if I can type on a

410
00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:15.269
keyboard, I have Inc Corp, I have been

411
00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:18.858
shaped, I've been molded, I have been controlled

412
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.390
by the keyboard so you can see it. Um

413
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.549
Or the pen, the pen is designed for my

414
00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:27.618
hand and my hand learns to be a different kind

415
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.469
of thing with the pen. I think that art

416
00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:33.719
and philosophy will come to philosophy, you said mhm

417
00:27:33.979 --> 00:27:41.150
are ways that we put ourselves on display for ourselves

418
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.068
and, and let us make changes, let us

419
00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:56.039
resist forms of habitual organization. So, and that's

420
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.608
, that's the work of art, that's the work

421
00:27:57.618 --> 00:28:03.420
of philosophy and that's, that's resistance to technology,

422
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.789
that's resistance to culture in a way. It's,

423
00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:07.890
it's paradox because we think of art as culture.

424
00:28:08.078 --> 00:28:11.250
But in a way I'm saying art is anti culture

425
00:28:11.739 --> 00:28:15.769
, art says no to what culture defines us as

426
00:28:15.949 --> 00:28:18.059
culture says, this is how you walk. This

427
00:28:18.068 --> 00:28:19.640
is how you talk. This is how you look

428
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.009
, this is how you feel. And art says

429
00:28:25.068 --> 00:28:27.989
no, art gives us different ways of walking,

430
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.029
talking, looking, thinking, feeling um which then

431
00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:41.920
in turn changes that so does this mean there's no

432
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:42.969
such thing as the science of human life? No

433
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.699
, but it means that there's a place inside life

434
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:52.989
for the aesthetic. And I think it has historically

435
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.229
been extremely difficult and maybe even it's finally impossible.

436
00:28:57.239 --> 00:29:00.959
I'm not sure but extremely difficult for science for what

437
00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:11.049
we call experimental or empirical science to comprehend the aesthetic

438
00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.489
and it's in a limit place in our lives.

439
00:29:15.318 --> 00:29:17.199
Now, let, let me say why? Why

440
00:29:17.209 --> 00:29:23.098
I say that? Um I actually already gave this

441
00:29:23.108 --> 00:29:27.630
example, take the question of perceptual consciousness. So

442
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.130
scientists say, OK, consciousness, it happens in

443
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.189
the brain, we can explore its neural correlates,

444
00:29:33.199 --> 00:29:37.509
we can use brain imaging and different theories of the

445
00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:41.199
brain and different theories of cognitive psychology to model what

446
00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:44.989
goes on in the brain when you see, right

447
00:29:45.368 --> 00:29:48.170
? But that takes for granted that we know what

448
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:55.039
seeing is. And I submit that there are no

449
00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:00.130
final settled unproblematic ways of answering the question. What

450
00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.750
do you see? Now, scientists for, for

451
00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:11.180
experimental purposes may choose to operationalize the notion of seeing

452
00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:15.838
this way or that way and that's fine. But

453
00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:19.900
you and I are the subjects of seeing, always

454
00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.019
realize that there's more that we're not saying is that

455
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:26.578
we're leaving something out. So right now, I

456
00:30:26.588 --> 00:30:30.368
I see the screen but I also see the background

457
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.930
. Now, do I see all the detail in

458
00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:33.368
the background or do I see some of the detail

459
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:33.750
in the background? Do I only see what I

460
00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:37.608
care about? But also my vis my experience right

461
00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:42.709
now, it's guided by interest concern what we're doing

462
00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:48.759
. It's not separate from our communication. It's also

463
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:52.199
not not separate from emotions that I have or curiosities

464
00:30:52.209 --> 00:30:53.640
that I have or uh you know, a desire

465
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.809
to promote my book or a desire to explain these

466
00:30:56.818 --> 00:30:59.449
ideas or desire to come across in a good way

467
00:30:59.479 --> 00:31:00.910
. I mean, this is very, very complicated

468
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:07.709
what set of relationships I have to my circumstances that

469
00:31:07.719 --> 00:31:10.739
I would describe by saying, you know, I

470
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.279
see your image on the screen, but I see

471
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:15.309
your image on the screen as a kind of uh

472
00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:25.088
cliche or minimal uh under under description of what I

473
00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:30.868
see. And my claim is that our relationship to

474
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.868
our own experience is a little bit like our relation

475
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.189
to a work of art. There's no one exhaustive

476
00:31:36.199 --> 00:31:40.189
way to characterize its meaning. And moreover, the

477
00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:47.219
very activity of thinking about our experience, like thinking

478
00:31:47.229 --> 00:31:49.910
about the work of art changes how we experience the

479
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.469
work of art and changes how we experience ourselves.

480
00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:56.039
And I think that's true for all of the fundamental

481
00:31:56.049 --> 00:32:00.519
human categories. Uh It's true for emotion, it's

482
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:02.868
true for perception, it's true for consciousness, it's

483
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.739
true for feeling. It's true for affect. I

484
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.170
even think it's true for, for rationality. It's

485
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.858
true for, for for reason itself, which means

486
00:32:10.868 --> 00:32:22.250
that um science rests on this molten unstable, constantly

487
00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:29.529
changing, legitimately contestable domain of the human. And

488
00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:38.529
uh that's, that's an important limitation. It means

489
00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:46.189
I think that a certain kind of positive knowledge such

490
00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:50.088
as we have in physics or chemistry is not going

491
00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:52.430
to be available to us in psychology or cognitive science

492
00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.269
. So, uh I mean, I guess that

493
00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:04.338
you've already addressed there at least a little bit the

494
00:33:04.348 --> 00:33:10.739
question of uh in your view, why probably disciplines

495
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:15.630
like psychology, cognitive science and other sciences of the

496
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:22.660
mind are not fully equipped to for uh to give

497
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:28.289
us a complete understanding of our human experience, human

498
00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:31.959
psychology and so on. But then uh could we

499
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:40.118
get that full picture by adding this understanding of art

500
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:45.939
and philosophy that you present in the book. And

501
00:33:45.949 --> 00:33:49.400
if so, and if so what kind of understanding

502
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.920
would this be, if not a strictly scientific one

503
00:33:55.239 --> 00:34:00.358
? Right. It's interesting. We, you know

504
00:34:00.358 --> 00:34:06.500
, we, we assume it's a very funny and

505
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:08.699
bizarre idea that one would, uh, that one

506
00:34:08.708 --> 00:34:14.628
would think that all knowledge and all experience could be

507
00:34:14.637 --> 00:34:16.748
packed into the shape of science. Science is itself

508
00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:21.768
a particular mode of human life and inquiry. And

509
00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:25.750
when you're, you know, when you're um ta

510
00:34:25.769 --> 00:34:30.469
talking to your kid at dinner, your relation to

511
00:34:30.478 --> 00:34:34.389
your child is not the relation, you have to

512
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:37.199
an empirical phenomenon. Uh You're in a relationship with

513
00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:40.548
your child and your concerns as a parent. I'm

514
00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:43.137
just saying that as an example, I don't know

515
00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:45.599
whether you have Children, but um your concerns as

516
00:34:45.608 --> 00:34:47.447
a parent are as much as you care about what's

517
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:50.579
best for your child and what science will tell you

518
00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.867
what's best for your child. Your concerns as a

519
00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:57.869
parent are not epistemological in that sense. Um And

520
00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:04.340
so much of human life has nothing to do with

521
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:12.619
um with uh with what we do when we're in

522
00:35:12.628 --> 00:35:15.039
the laboratory. Um And one of the curious things

523
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.628
that philosophy has done is it's opened up this thought

524
00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:28.978
that somehow the truest mode of human relationship with the

525
00:35:28.989 --> 00:35:31.648
world around us is something like that of the scientists

526
00:35:31.659 --> 00:35:35.860
relation to the scientific object. Maybe, maybe this

527
00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:37.418
goes back to, to Descartes. I it may

528
00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:42.269
go back farther. But um you know, in

529
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.369
the book, I talk about the contrast between between

530
00:35:45.378 --> 00:35:54.349
Descartes and Vica um uh for Des Cartes, the

531
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.978
scientific method, the geometrical method is, is the

532
00:35:59.989 --> 00:36:07.478
basis is the fundamental mode of knowing Vico, who

533
00:36:07.489 --> 00:36:08.989
I'm, I'm not an expert on and I rely

534
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.079
heavily on secondary sources in my understanding of Vico.

535
00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:16.938
But Vico is um especially I might say a lovely

536
00:36:16.949 --> 00:36:24.349
book about him by Jurgen Trabant. Um uh Vico

537
00:36:24.398 --> 00:36:31.809
is a uh is a person who thinks of poetry

538
00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:37.978
and wit and style and irony as the basic modality

539
00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:44.418
of human knowing. Um And there's a kind of

540
00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:51.139
comprehension, a kind of deep, intellectually rigorous comprehension

541
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.898
that has to do with language, words, with

542
00:36:53.909 --> 00:36:58.909
the play of the intellect, not the deduction,

543
00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:01.360
but the flirtation. It's a, it's, it's

544
00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:02.728
real. I don't know if he would have said

545
00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:06.219
that actually, but it's, but not the deduction

546
00:37:06.228 --> 00:37:10.110
, but the um the ironic play of, of

547
00:37:10.119 --> 00:37:20.849
storytelling. Um And it's, it's interesting because obviously

548
00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:23.110
we need both, we need both, both,

549
00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:28.719
both complement each other. But um so the idea

550
00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:32.938
that there's no place for the kind of special work

551
00:37:32.949 --> 00:37:37.860
we do when we do science is, is a

552
00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:40.199
form of irrational is, but the idea that all

553
00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:45.978
human knowledge should take that form is I think an

554
00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:52.760
equally benighted form of misunderstanding. And it's one which

555
00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:58.840
interestingly, uh it strikes me that it's one that

556
00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:04.309
we're confronting in a very interesting way in the intellectual

557
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.188
space surrounding artificial intelligence, um which is its whole

558
00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:12.119
separate topic. Uh We can put to one side

559
00:38:12.128 --> 00:38:15.079
. But um but so one last thing then,

560
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:15.958
then I'll shut up because II, I do give

561
00:38:15.969 --> 00:38:19.059
two long answers. I apologize. But the,

562
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.989
I think another name for that space or method of

563
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:37.409
inquiry, which is necessary and complementary to, to

564
00:38:37.418 --> 00:38:44.449
natural science is philosophy and dark. So, um

565
00:38:44.809 --> 00:38:45.889
it's, I think that there's a way in which

566
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:57.780
um what philosophy and art aim at doing is not

567
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:05.550
um taking questions for granted and looking for the solutions

568
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.728
, but they explore the questions we've neglected or they

569
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.750
um you know, a quote that I give in

570
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.099
the book comes from, from the American writer James

571
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:24.168
Baldwin is that art uncovers the questions that have been

572
00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:28.958
hidden by the answers. So, and I think

573
00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:30.119
something like that is true of philosophy as well.

574
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.378
It's, it's not the answers, it's, it's

575
00:39:36.648 --> 00:39:38.228
, it's um what the answers hide from view.

576
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:44.148
Um And one of the interesting things about a work

577
00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:46.059
of art and this is this is a really important

578
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.309
piece of phenomenological data. One of the really interesting

579
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.659
things about a work of art is it's there for

580
00:39:53.668 --> 00:40:00.050
you on display. It's nothing is hidden as Liechtenstein

581
00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:01.978
might have said it's just, it hangs there,

582
00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:09.168
it sits there and yet you cannot really see it

583
00:40:10.168 --> 00:40:15.539
, it defies straightforward, seeing it, it makes

584
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.648
you do something in order to see it. So

585
00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:21.179
for me and this is, I haven't had a

586
00:40:21.188 --> 00:40:22.409
chance to say this yet in our conversation, but

587
00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:27.360
it's, it's, it's crucial. I think um

588
00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:29.579
I think you appreciate this based on your reading of

589
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.699
the book. But I offer a new definition of

590
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:35.750
the aesthetic in this book or not a new definition

591
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.398
. I, I offer a way of thinking about

592
00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:42.409
the aesthetic, which I think is somewhat novel.

593
00:40:42.728 --> 00:40:51.949
And for me, the aesthetic denotes the work we

594
00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:57.110
do of trying to see what we cannot see or

595
00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:00.269
of trying to bring into focus, what is open

596
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.438
to view, but somehow cut off from it.

597
00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:08.418
Aesthetics names the movement from not perceiving, to perceiving

598
00:41:08.429 --> 00:41:12.728
or not seeing, to seeing or perceiving or seeing

599
00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:21.418
to seeing or perceiving differently. And uh that's the

600
00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:23.320
work that, that Plato did and that's the work

601
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:25.199
that Kunz did and that's the work that Hagel did

602
00:41:25.208 --> 00:41:28.099
. And that's the work that Wittgenstein did and that's

603
00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.989
the work that Frager did and that's the work that

604
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.648
, that all great philosophers really aim at not new

605
00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:37.000
data, not new facts and but new ways of

606
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:42.599
seeing what was there all along or which is just

607
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:49.719
to say works about or philosophical work invites you to

608
00:41:49.728 --> 00:41:52.179
make changes to yourself so that you can come into

609
00:41:52.188 --> 00:41:54.250
a relationship with what is there all about. And

610
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.849
my view is that you can't, you can't eliminate

611
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.668
that. I mean, you li you can close

612
00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:04.050
down every art department and every philosophy department and only

613
00:42:04.059 --> 00:42:06.708
fund engineering and physics departments, but you can't get

614
00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:10.500
rid of art and philosophy because art and philosophy are

615
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.958
prior to physics, um physics is seeking the explanation

616
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.208
, art and philosophy are about perception. They're about

617
00:42:20.219 --> 00:42:23.280
a more immediate kind of, of knowledge. Um

618
00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:30.860
Yeah. So let me ask you one question about

619
00:42:30.869 --> 00:42:36.639
philosophy just to clarify this point because it's actually something

620
00:42:36.648 --> 00:42:40.000
that uh I mean, I'm not sure uh what

621
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:45.429
is your precise idea here. But when you use

622
00:42:45.438 --> 00:42:49.530
the word philosophy, when you talk about philosophy here

623
00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:52.378
in our conversation, and also in your book,

624
00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:59.840
are you referring to what uh philosophers, academic philosophers

625
00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:04.550
or any other sort of professional philosophers uh do?

626
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.978
Or is it a broader activity that people who are

627
00:43:09.989 --> 00:43:15.438
not professionally, philosophers can also do and can also

628
00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:19.659
experience through, I don't know, thought processes,

629
00:43:19.668 --> 00:43:27.148
processes of reflection about their own condition about what kinds

630
00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:34.269
of questions might raise uh about the existence or anything

631
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.860
else uh around them. Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful

632
00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:40.668
question. Exactly goes right to the very heart of

633
00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:45.398
the issue. Um It reminds me of where our

634
00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:51.728
conversation began with my distinguishing uh anthropological sense of what

635
00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:53.148
art is from a more philosophical sense. And I

636
00:43:53.159 --> 00:43:55.708
think exactly the same point can be made about philosophy

637
00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:58.590
, you can think of, you can think of

638
00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:00.918
philosophy as whatever it is that is taught in philosophy

639
00:44:00.929 --> 00:44:02.849
department. So whatever it is that is published by

640
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.530
books that are categorized as philosophy books. Um And

641
00:44:07.539 --> 00:44:10.599
in that sense, and that does kind of give

642
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.438
you a nice way of picking out what it is

643
00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:15.840
. And if you're, if you're a person out

644
00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:17.378
there in the world who's never had the privilege of

645
00:44:17.389 --> 00:44:20.769
studying philosophy, that's a useful way of thinking about

646
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.929
what philosophy is. This is your opportunity to,

647
00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:24.590
you go to a university and you meet people who

648
00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:28.148
are dedicated to this work. Um And that's a

649
00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:31.860
very valuable thing, but I would say two things

650
00:44:32.188 --> 00:44:37.079
first that um there's an additional further sense in which

651
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:46.208
philosophy is a certain style of intellectual work. And

652
00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:52.260
that although academic philosophers do that work, uh that

653
00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:55.989
work is not confined to the work of professional philosophers

654
00:44:58.639 --> 00:45:07.590
. And I would say that philosophy um uh philosophical

655
00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:20.760
problems presents itself potentially at least in every walk of

656
00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:27.750
life and in every domain. So to make AAA

657
00:45:27.789 --> 00:45:34.329
I think a fairly uncontroversial point, um there is

658
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.619
philosophy done by people who are empirical sciences. No

659
00:45:38.628 --> 00:45:42.539
many people believe. And I would agree that some

660
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:47.239
of Einstein's most important breakthroughs were philosophical in the sense

661
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:54.010
that he wasn't discovering a piece of information about simultaneity

662
00:45:54.289 --> 00:45:57.610
. He was really asking us to get to the

663
00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:00.329
heart of what we think we mean when we speak

664
00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.789
of two events as being simultaneous. He was doing

665
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.050
a kind of conceptual analysis which for me and I

666
00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:09.289
have a kind of platonic view of this is a

667
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.969
kind of reminding ourselves of how our concepts work and

668
00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:15.750
of, of what our, how our concepts relate

669
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.280
to each other. So similarly, I think a

670
00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:22.829
lot of the work that counts as cognitive science,

671
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:28.530
whether you think of, of uh work by linguists

672
00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:31.369
like Noam Chomsky or work by vision scientists like David

673
00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:39.019
Maher or James Gibson uh has aspects that I just

674
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:43.478
straight philosophy. You see this in mathematics. I

675
00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:47.949
think a lot of a lot of mathematics or like

676
00:46:47.958 --> 00:46:51.989
take Fraga's anxieties about what numbers were, those were

677
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.659
philosophical anxieties about the the ontology of number. So

678
00:46:54.668 --> 00:47:00.489
I say all this just because philosophical problems aren't the

679
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.809
private property of card carrying academic professors of philosophy.

680
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.010
You can be a mathematician or a neuroscientist or a

681
00:47:07.019 --> 00:47:10.889
linguist or a computer scientist and engage with philosophy.

682
00:47:10.898 --> 00:47:15.628
So, moreover, I think we engage in philosophy

683
00:47:15.639 --> 00:47:21.510
all the time when we uh outside of intellectual life

684
00:47:21.519 --> 00:47:31.340
altogether, when we uh when we interrogate our lives

685
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:39.059
and our values and our choices um ethics is not

686
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:44.840
confined to the academy. Ethical problems are, are

687
00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:46.918
real problems and they're philosophical problems. So what's the

688
00:47:46.929 --> 00:47:50.809
definition of a philosophical problem then for me, I

689
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.668
mean, I, I don't have a, a

690
00:47:52.679 --> 00:47:54.110
perfect answer, but it's gonna be something like this

691
00:47:55.699 --> 00:48:04.628
. Philosophical questions are questions that are substantial and significant

692
00:48:05.978 --> 00:48:10.728
, but for which there are no decision procedures or

693
00:48:10.739 --> 00:48:15.010
there are no settled ways of answering them. So

694
00:48:15.019 --> 00:48:19.389
, you know, I think a classical example is

695
00:48:19.398 --> 00:48:22.780
an ethical kind of where people have different ethical views

696
00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.789
. There's a real disagreement and it matters, but

697
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:34.260
there isn't a method for deciding it's, and that's

698
00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:36.349
what I would say is so there's, there is

699
00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.750
, I mean, there is a method for,

700
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.869
for, for engaging intellectual exchange and argument, but

701
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:47.478
there's no method for deciding um in the way that

702
00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:54.570
there is inside well-developed empirical theory. Um Now what

703
00:48:54.579 --> 00:48:59.530
I, the way I just define philosophical problem is

704
00:48:59.539 --> 00:49:05.750
precisely the way um can't defined an aesthetic problem.

705
00:49:07.699 --> 00:49:14.418
The thing about aesthetics is um different people can have

706
00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:23.610
different aesthetic responses and there's no way of deciding in

707
00:49:23.619 --> 00:49:27.000
advance as it were, who's right and who's wrong

708
00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.739
. And yet, according to Kant, the disagreement

709
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.519
is inters subjectively significant, actual disagreement. It's not

710
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.958
like I like vanilla, you like chocolate. It's

711
00:49:38.969 --> 00:49:44.599
like no chocolate is better than vanilla. And it's

712
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:45.280
, we can, we, we can argue about

713
00:49:45.289 --> 00:49:52.199
that. Um um uh And people do argue about

714
00:49:52.208 --> 00:49:54.559
it and they do change their minds over time,

715
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:59.228
not because there's a Qed. So I think it

716
00:49:59.239 --> 00:50:02.250
was actually Gilbert Ryle who said no philosophical argument ends

717
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:12.458
with a Qed. Thus, it prove um I

718
00:50:12.469 --> 00:50:15.760
agree with that. Now, let me just let

719
00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:17.559
me say something else. A very interesting question.

720
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:23.269
What the way I've just characterized philosophy is how that

721
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.780
stands in relation to the actual practice of professional philosophers

722
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:34.128
um at universities. Um Is this a revisionist analysis

723
00:50:34.139 --> 00:50:36.769
or am I saying that there's what, what,

724
00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.329
how does, how does, how does that,

725
00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:45.188
that go? And um I guess I would say

726
00:50:45.199 --> 00:50:51.378
something like this, the final value of the work

727
00:50:51.389 --> 00:51:04.059
done by philosophers at universities like my own is the

728
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:10.809
way it enables the kind of change and transformation that

729
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.110
I'm talking about. Whether or not that's the conscious

730
00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:20.539
aim or objective of the philosophers in question and whether

731
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:27.570
or not they have that particular self understanding. So

732
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.280
, you know, these days, I think especially

733
00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:37.438
in the analytic philosophical world, there's a huge pressure

734
00:51:37.449 --> 00:51:45.119
to model philosophy on the model of the sciences.

735
00:51:45.438 --> 00:51:47.250
So to give, to give an example, it

736
00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.300
is rarely discussed. But I think it's very interesting

737
00:51:51.168 --> 00:51:53.849
. Yes, in science, you write abstracts of

738
00:51:53.860 --> 00:52:00.898
articles and people can search abstracts and that's very useful

739
00:52:00.228 --> 00:52:04.929
because if I wanna start working on a certain protein

740
00:52:04.938 --> 00:52:06.869
, I wanna search and find out who else has

741
00:52:06.878 --> 00:52:08.449
worked on that protein and be sure I've read everything

742
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:13.309
that's ever been written about it. And so now

743
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.628
we abstract philosophy papers too. If you try to

744
00:52:15.639 --> 00:52:19.610
publish philosophical article, you need to submit an abstract

745
00:52:22.478 --> 00:52:25.708
. But a philosophy paper cannot be summed up as

746
00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:31.820
a simple finding or abstracted claim because there are none

747
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:36.309
in philosophy that is in philosophy. The the very

748
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.300
meaning of the claim is always what the paper is

749
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:43.449
about. Philosophy literally doesn't have a bottom line.

750
00:52:44.139 --> 00:52:47.800
It's it's always an interrogation. The meaning of the

751
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:52.550
bottom line depends on all the conversation and reasoning that

752
00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:57.340
gets you there, which is why we can read

753
00:52:57.349 --> 00:53:00.510
Kant without agreeing with Kant. We don't say,

754
00:53:00.519 --> 00:53:02.699
oh, he was mistaken. Therefore, we don't

755
00:53:02.708 --> 00:53:06.458
read him or Plato is mistaken. Therefore, we

756
00:53:06.469 --> 00:53:09.159
don't read him or, you know, Bertrand Russell

757
00:53:09.168 --> 00:53:10.978
was mistaken. Therefore, we don't read him.

758
00:53:15.148 --> 00:53:16.639
And there's a way in which the category of mistake

759
00:53:16.648 --> 00:53:20.728
is not even relevant. What we're interested in is

760
00:53:20.739 --> 00:53:24.429
whether the work they're doing helps us with the problems

761
00:53:24.438 --> 00:53:31.039
we have. And that depends on the work we

762
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:34.668
do with the text. And there is nothing to

763
00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:36.110
do with the bottom line. I mean, it

764
00:53:36.119 --> 00:53:37.418
doesn't to do with the bottom line, but it

765
00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:38.139
has to do with how we reach the bottom line

766
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:44.260
, you know, are mathematical propositions synthetic a priori

767
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:49.789
. Well, what the really interesting question is not

768
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.199
whether co was right or wrong? But what does

769
00:53:51.208 --> 00:53:52.510
that mean? What does it mean to say that

770
00:53:52.519 --> 00:53:54.789
the synthetic opera? Why would one say that?

771
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.340
What is one trying to, what is the insight

772
00:53:58.349 --> 00:54:00.590
one is trying to capture, capture when you say

773
00:54:00.599 --> 00:54:04.449
that? And then you can go further, you

774
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:07.099
say, well, it means we don't, we

775
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.929
don't use ordinary empirical methods for verifying mathematical statements.

776
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:15.469
Well, that's true. Um So why aren't they

777
00:54:15.648 --> 00:54:17.679
, why aren't they just here? Well, and

778
00:54:17.688 --> 00:54:23.378
yet they seem to be substantial, not merely logical

779
00:54:23.389 --> 00:54:25.019
, they seem to be telling us about something they

780
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:28.648
seem to have content. Oh OK. So they're

781
00:54:28.659 --> 00:54:30.349
synthetic. And so then you tell Mr, but

782
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.949
then there's, you can get into the discussions and

783
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:36.750
maybe that is, or it isn't a useful way

784
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.110
of summing it up. Most people these days I

785
00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:42.938
think, don't argue for the view that mathematics is

786
00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:49.849
synthetic or p why not. Um Anyway, so

787
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.389
, so one of the ideas I play with in

788
00:54:51.398 --> 00:54:53.820
the book, which is kind of a uh a

789
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:57.398
whimsical idea. But I think there's, there's really

790
00:54:57.409 --> 00:55:00.389
some truth to it is I think of a philosophical

791
00:55:00.398 --> 00:55:04.840
text is like a musical score. And when I

792
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:07.938
teach my students a philosophical text, I'm teaching them

793
00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:12.849
not to know what the author believed, but I'm

794
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.219
teaching them to play the score, to play along

795
00:55:16.449 --> 00:55:21.668
, to play with, to make, to make

796
00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:23.989
philosophy, with this, this, this, these

797
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:34.878
resources and you know, finally the, the the

798
00:55:34.889 --> 00:55:37.478
students are gonna tell me whether it's meaningful to them

799
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:42.820
and they either will or will not keep playing philosophers

800
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:45.110
grow out of fashion. You know, when I

801
00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:50.668
was a student starting my graduate studies, you couldn't

802
00:55:50.679 --> 00:55:53.519
have a philosophical, philosophical conversation about anything without talking

803
00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:58.599
about Donald Davidson. Mm Or, or, or

804
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.219
coin, I don't often hear people refer to Quan

805
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:06.159
and Davidson these days, not because their work is

806
00:56:06.168 --> 00:56:10.000
any less important as it once was, but people

807
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:13.260
are less interested in playing it. They wanna play

808
00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:15.530
other music now they wanna play other styles of,

809
00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:21.000
of thinking. Now, I might, I might

810
00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.360
not be correct about that, but that's a,

811
00:56:22.478 --> 00:56:27.039
I'm giving that as an example. Um Kant has

812
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.449
stayed in fashion ever since he, ever since he

813
00:56:30.458 --> 00:56:36.628
appeared Hager Nietzsche. These guys, they're, they're

814
00:56:36.639 --> 00:56:39.228
like, always popular. Why? Because they're right

815
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.059
. And what we talk about the difference between analytic

816
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:49.668
and continental philosophy, that's the most to anybody who's

817
00:56:49.679 --> 00:56:52.260
outside of philosophy, that's the stupidest thing that there

818
00:56:52.269 --> 00:56:54.519
could possibly be like or for that matter, Western

819
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.340
philosophy versus world philosophy. Why, why should,

820
00:56:59.079 --> 00:57:06.349
why should we only care about philosophy in one language

821
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.239
or in one tradition? That's silly. Um On

822
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.668
the other hand, if you think of it,

823
00:57:10.679 --> 00:57:15.378
is it like music? Well, people live inside

824
00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:17.699
their musical cultures, they live inside their artistic cultures

825
00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:20.820
. I can't, I don't know how to speak

826
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:23.659
Chinese and I don't know how to play Chinese philosophy

827
00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:25.840
. I mean, that's in, that's I don't

828
00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:29.860
mean to be making an argument for uh or like

829
00:57:29.869 --> 00:57:32.780
ignorance. But on the other hand, people specialize

830
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:36.398
people live inside the, the places where they find

831
00:57:36.409 --> 00:57:40.010
themselves. Um And in doing so, they also

832
00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:49.039
expand. So European philosophy is, is not confined

833
00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:54.889
to Europe. So let me ask you one question

834
00:57:54.898 --> 00:57:58.679
, I think that you've already been touching on this

835
00:57:58.688 --> 00:58:02.929
throughout our conversation. But when it comes to science

836
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:08.208
, specifically taking into account the sort of a framework

837
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:13.168
that you present in the book. And since science

838
00:58:13.179 --> 00:58:15.159
itself is also, of course, a human endeavor

839
00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:23.159
then um how does it relate to philosophy, to

840
00:58:23.168 --> 00:58:28.208
art? And I, is there space for uh

841
00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:32.010
art, for example, in the very practice of

842
00:58:32.019 --> 00:58:37.800
science or not? Yeah. Um So I'm thinking

843
00:58:37.809 --> 00:58:42.378
about it because it's um I, I really don't

844
00:58:42.389 --> 00:58:45.378
wanna say no to science, I wanna say yes

845
00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:50.119
to art and yes to philosophy. And I think

846
00:58:50.128 --> 00:58:53.438
that um I mean, I think that there,

847
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:54.909
I mean, in the book, the way I

848
00:58:54.918 --> 00:59:01.570
explore this is I want to differentiate art um from

849
00:59:01.579 --> 00:59:04.989
life or arts, from technology. And I wanted

850
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.728
different which means like I differentiate art from design.

851
00:59:09.909 --> 00:59:19.110
Um And I differentiate philosophy from science, but these

852
00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:27.369
are entangled, right? Um There is, there

853
00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:29.829
is no science without philosophy and there is no philosophy

854
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:39.688
without science. Um Not just because some philosophers are

855
00:59:39.699 --> 00:59:44.349
sometimes interested in empirical questions or some scientists are sometimes

856
00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:51.929
interested in philosophical questions, but because science and philosophy

857
00:59:51.938 --> 00:60:00.418
are different neighborhoods or sort of different ends of a

858
00:60:00.429 --> 00:60:07.128
spectrum to change the metaphor. And they, they

859
00:60:07.139 --> 00:60:09.378
have there's also neighborhoods where they're very near to each

860
00:60:09.389 --> 00:60:16.110
other. So some philosophical work just is not in

861
00:60:16.519 --> 00:60:22.349
interestingly or meaningfully different from empirical scientific work and vice

862
00:60:22.360 --> 00:60:30.050
versa. Um So notice I'm not saying, oh

863
00:60:30.059 --> 00:60:31.409
yeah, scientists should study art because it'll be a

864
00:60:31.418 --> 00:60:36.030
useful method for their scientific work that may or may

865
00:60:36.039 --> 00:60:40.989
not sometimes be true. Um I mean, a

866
00:60:42.000 --> 00:60:45.610
very interesting domain kind of problem that comes up in

867
00:60:45.619 --> 00:60:52.090
science is uh is visualization. Um whether a scientist

868
00:60:52.099 --> 00:60:57.250
is trying to visualize a black hole with a picture

869
00:60:57.989 --> 00:61:01.320
or visualize or in some sense, represent the structure

870
00:61:01.329 --> 00:61:07.489
of a protein molecule or whether they want to um

871
00:61:08.869 --> 00:61:16.610
represent how the brain is built. I mean,

872
00:61:16.619 --> 00:61:24.340
an interesting example is uh Gogi and Kahar one,

873
00:61:24.500 --> 00:61:30.090
the Nobel Prize essentially for making good pictures of cells

874
00:61:30.519 --> 00:61:32.500
. They just took pictures of cells, they figured

875
00:61:32.510 --> 00:61:35.500
out how to do it, but they didn't just

876
00:61:35.760 --> 00:61:39.469
photograph the cell. They Dr Ramon Khal drew the

877
00:61:39.478 --> 00:61:47.458
sir and his drawings were theoretically informed explanations of how

878
00:61:47.469 --> 00:61:51.829
the cells worked. So he's a, he really

879
00:61:51.840 --> 00:61:57.449
understood the dendritic and the the the the axonic structure

880
00:61:57.458 --> 00:62:00.949
and the um the cell body versus these, these

881
00:62:00.958 --> 00:62:08.219
, these fingerings that that come out. Um So

882
00:62:08.228 --> 00:62:12.090
in a way, all he did was help you

883
00:62:12.099 --> 00:62:15.648
see something that was there, which is very close

884
00:62:15.659 --> 00:62:17.199
to my definition of what an artistic project is.

885
00:62:17.208 --> 00:62:21.750
And he certainly, apparently from what I understand about

886
00:62:21.760 --> 00:62:24.519
uh Ramon Kaha, uh Santiago Monica's life as if

887
00:62:24.530 --> 00:62:25.969
he, he wanted to be an artist. And

888
00:62:25.978 --> 00:62:28.840
his father said, no, his father said you

889
00:62:28.849 --> 00:62:30.329
have to stay in the family business, which is

890
00:62:30.340 --> 00:62:32.409
medicine. So he found a way to be an

891
00:62:32.418 --> 00:62:37.010
artist in medicine and these drawings of his, I'm

892
00:62:37.019 --> 00:62:38.929
sure you've seen them. Now there's now some beautiful

893
00:62:38.938 --> 00:62:43.478
books available, the new production, um these are

894
00:62:44.949 --> 00:62:47.489
puzzling drawing. Now, I mean, they're interesting

895
00:62:47.500 --> 00:62:51.619
drawings. Now, for me, I said at

896
00:62:51.628 --> 00:62:54.070
the outset that the difference between an art drawing and

897
00:62:54.079 --> 00:62:58.679
a and a and a mere pictorial drawing is that

898
00:62:58.688 --> 00:63:01.849
a mere pictorial drawing has a function, it's of

899
00:63:01.860 --> 00:63:05.639
something and you read the caption and that tells you

900
00:63:05.648 --> 00:63:07.340
what it's of and this is a representation of that

901
00:63:08.889 --> 00:63:14.228
. Um So if you stick strictly to that definition

902
00:63:14.438 --> 00:63:19.579
, then, then uh Ramonica has work is not

903
00:63:19.849 --> 00:63:24.329
artwork, it's illustration. OK. But is it

904
00:63:24.340 --> 00:63:28.010
only that, is it ever, only one thing

905
00:63:29.289 --> 00:63:31.010
are things ever? Only one thing? This is

906
00:63:31.019 --> 00:63:36.840
a really interesting point because um this is a feature

907
00:63:36.849 --> 00:63:40.389
of the entanglement. So take, take the great

908
00:63:43.780 --> 00:63:49.840
paintings of renaissance churches in a, in a sense

909
00:63:49.849 --> 00:63:52.989
, they have a caption. These are illustrations of

910
00:63:52.000 --> 00:63:57.719
stories from the Bible for illiterate people. These are

911
00:63:57.728 --> 00:64:04.469
precisely didactic, functional tools for indoctrination. But they're

912
00:64:04.478 --> 00:64:09.059
not only that they're never, they're never only that

913
00:64:10.000 --> 00:64:11.489
. I mean, sometimes they are only that and

914
00:64:11.500 --> 00:64:15.059
then they're not very artistically interesting. But the reason

915
00:64:15.070 --> 00:64:18.179
why we why even non-christian people, non-religious people visit

916
00:64:18.188 --> 00:64:21.489
those churches today is because they're not only that.

917
00:64:23.728 --> 00:64:27.309
Mhm And that might be true of Kahal Ramon Kala

918
00:64:27.579 --> 00:64:32.668
as well, which is interesting. Um So I

919
00:64:32.679 --> 00:64:35.449
don't want to be dogmatic and this is why I

920
00:64:35.458 --> 00:64:39.590
use this metaphor of the entanglement because it, it

921
00:64:39.599 --> 00:64:44.619
allows you to see how two things can become one

922
00:64:44.628 --> 00:64:49.559
thing even though there are two things. So uh

923
00:64:49.570 --> 00:64:53.639
, I have one last topic that I would like

924
00:64:53.648 --> 00:64:56.378
to explore with you here today. I'm not sure

925
00:64:56.389 --> 00:64:59.840
if this will be necessarily my last question or not

926
00:64:59.849 --> 00:65:02.070
. But let's see. So, e even before

927
00:65:02.079 --> 00:65:06.110
we started recording, we were talking a little bit

928
00:65:06.119 --> 00:65:11.159
and one of the subjects that we touched on that

929
00:65:11.168 --> 00:65:14.789
we, I thought would be very interesting to bring

930
00:65:14.800 --> 00:65:17.978
back here to the interview was that, um,

931
00:65:17.989 --> 00:65:21.840
across the world at the moment, at least,

932
00:65:21.849 --> 00:65:26.300
and you were talking about there in the US?

933
00:65:26.309 --> 00:65:28.878
And I said that here in Portugal is more or

934
00:65:28.889 --> 00:65:31.780
less the same. People are feeling this sense of

935
00:65:31.789 --> 00:65:35.949
uneasiness. We think that or we look at things

936
00:65:35.958 --> 00:65:40.938
as very fragile. Uh I mean, the economic

937
00:65:40.949 --> 00:65:45.208
situation, the political context, new wars breaking out

938
00:65:45.219 --> 00:65:49.978
climate change and so on, everything seems very unstable

939
00:65:49.989 --> 00:65:55.458
. And the reason why I'm bringing this to the

940
00:65:55.469 --> 00:65:59.199
conversation is that, uh I mean, is there

941
00:65:59.208 --> 00:66:04.719
any way by which we can understand uh our current

942
00:66:04.769 --> 00:66:09.708
state and the way we react, reacting to things

943
00:66:09.719 --> 00:66:13.599
, our sense of uneasiness and so on through the

944
00:66:13.610 --> 00:66:17.360
kind of framework that you bring to your book?

945
00:66:20.389 --> 00:66:23.179
Yeah, I'm, I'm glad you bring this up

946
00:66:23.188 --> 00:66:24.938
. It's something I've been thinking a lot about.

947
00:66:25.469 --> 00:66:28.610
One of, one of my favorite texts in this

948
00:66:28.619 --> 00:66:32.250
vicinity is Hussars, this the um the crisis of

949
00:66:32.260 --> 00:66:36.349
the European Sciences. Um I don't know if this

950
00:66:36.360 --> 00:66:39.329
is a book that, you know, um it

951
00:66:39.340 --> 00:66:42.369
was published in the, it was written in the

952
00:66:42.378 --> 00:66:48.110
late 19 thirties. After Hal was already in exile

953
00:66:48.340 --> 00:66:51.449
, he was forced into exile, lost his professorship

954
00:66:51.458 --> 00:66:56.128
because he was Jewish. And in under national socialism

955
00:66:56.139 --> 00:67:01.659
, he couldn't, he couldn't teach. Um he

956
00:67:01.668 --> 00:67:03.688
was in Prague, I think when he wrote,

957
00:67:03.708 --> 00:67:10.159
when he wrote this book and you know, the

958
00:67:11.179 --> 00:67:14.239
, the Second World War was on the horizon,

959
00:67:15.579 --> 00:67:24.769
Confronting Germany Europe and the World. And in that

960
00:67:24.780 --> 00:67:31.929
book, whose role makes by my reading at least

961
00:67:32.519 --> 00:67:42.300
a wild clam, he says that the problem that

962
00:67:42.309 --> 00:67:46.250
the world is facing is a philosophical problem. You

963
00:67:46.260 --> 00:67:48.719
know, here's Germany getting ready to invade all of

964
00:67:48.728 --> 00:67:51.599
Europe. He himself has been deprived of his position

965
00:67:53.398 --> 00:67:58.199
. Anti-semitism is run amok and the problem is philosophical

966
00:67:58.208 --> 00:68:01.289
and specifically, he thought it was a problem with

967
00:68:01.300 --> 00:68:06.148
European science, a philosophical problem about science. Mm

968
00:68:06.438 --> 00:68:12.728
um And then further what the problem was for hu

969
00:68:14.750 --> 00:68:16.949
was not that science was too insufficient or too weak

970
00:68:16.958 --> 00:68:18.958
, but that it was too strong, it was

971
00:68:18.970 --> 00:68:24.350
too powerful, it was too effective. Science was

972
00:68:24.359 --> 00:68:27.390
taken over everything and every space seemed to be a

973
00:68:27.399 --> 00:68:32.047
scientific space. Um But Huso said that that the

974
00:68:32.059 --> 00:68:41.359
kinds of standards of precision positivity that science offers us

975
00:68:43.259 --> 00:68:48.838
don't apply to ourselves. Just as I've been arguing

976
00:68:49.689 --> 00:68:55.270
, they don't apply to consciousness subjectivity, they don't

977
00:68:55.279 --> 00:69:02.199
apply to reason itself. Now, how you get

978
00:69:02.208 --> 00:69:04.918
from there to the Second World War is that's a

979
00:69:04.930 --> 00:69:06.850
kind of a what I'm not sure this, that's

980
00:69:06.859 --> 00:69:10.770
the direction I want to go in. But our

981
00:69:10.779 --> 00:69:15.449
cultural moment strikes me as very, very similar to

982
00:69:15.458 --> 00:69:26.810
his we science is immensely prestigious in our world today

983
00:69:29.680 --> 00:69:33.408
. And yet the fundamental picture of human life that

984
00:69:33.417 --> 00:69:39.409
science offers, it is very limited. I mean

985
00:69:39.418 --> 00:69:41.649
, there are different, there are different offerings.

986
00:69:41.659 --> 00:69:45.640
There's the evolutionary perspective, according to which we're genes

987
00:69:45.079 --> 00:69:50.140
, there's the sort of the neuroscientific perspective according to

988
00:69:50.149 --> 00:69:54.318
which we're just brain cells. There's the kind of

989
00:69:54.328 --> 00:69:59.009
computational perspective according to which we're just algorithms. Um

990
00:70:00.000 --> 00:70:10.009
But I think that there's something dissatisfying and unbelievable that

991
00:70:10.289 --> 00:70:14.310
the embodied socially situated historical beings that we are could

992
00:70:14.319 --> 00:70:17.270
be just brain cells or just genes or just algorithms

993
00:70:17.640 --> 00:70:21.649
. And um and that then in turn, I

994
00:70:21.659 --> 00:70:33.100
think maybe breeds anti scientific suspicion because there's a kind

995
00:70:33.109 --> 00:70:35.289
of way in which science is making claims that are

996
00:70:35.298 --> 00:70:40.958
not believable. So, and maybe that feeds crisis

997
00:70:40.970 --> 00:70:43.779
, I'm not sure, certainly one of the different

998
00:70:43.789 --> 00:70:46.878
crises we face when you think about the climate crisis

999
00:70:47.359 --> 00:70:53.119
is how many people deny the climate crisis. Um

1000
00:70:53.810 --> 00:70:57.659
or um you know, we saw, we saw

1001
00:70:57.668 --> 00:71:03.579
during the pandemic how many people denied the uh the

1002
00:71:03.588 --> 00:71:14.500
necessity and efficacy of vaccine, um religious religious fundamentalists

1003
00:71:14.509 --> 00:71:15.600
around the world, you know, deny evolution,

1004
00:71:15.609 --> 00:71:21.039
they deny anything. And uh and in one sense

1005
00:71:21.048 --> 00:71:24.029
, don't get me wrong. I'm I, I

1006
00:71:24.039 --> 00:71:26.088
speak as a, as a lover of science.

1007
00:71:26.430 --> 00:71:30.048
Um in one sense, I think they are rightly

1008
00:71:30.810 --> 00:71:35.458
castigated as ignorant and idiotic. These people who,

1009
00:71:35.470 --> 00:71:39.890
who attack science in that way, but not entirely

1010
00:71:41.088 --> 00:71:45.250
because science as hr feared, knows no bounds and

1011
00:71:45.259 --> 00:71:47.668
seems to be the only game in town. But

1012
00:71:47.680 --> 00:71:50.109
the, but these important questions that matter to us

1013
00:71:50.119 --> 00:71:56.088
about values, subjectivity, consciousness, rationality, these

1014
00:71:56.100 --> 00:71:59.770
questions are not scientist questions, but how do we

1015
00:71:59.779 --> 00:72:01.159
answer them? Well, they're philosophies questions. They're

1016
00:72:01.168 --> 00:72:06.520
arts questions. So again, I, I would

1017
00:72:06.529 --> 00:72:11.208
be embarrassed to argue that art and philosophy can save

1018
00:72:11.239 --> 00:72:14.619
us. You know, that, that, that

1019
00:72:14.628 --> 00:72:16.208
, that, that um that we can, you

1020
00:72:16.220 --> 00:72:20.319
know that art and philosophy are gonna cure the climate

1021
00:72:20.329 --> 00:72:24.579
crisis. No, obviously not, you need science

1022
00:72:24.588 --> 00:72:28.168
for that, but science alone can't do it either

1023
00:72:29.119 --> 00:72:31.579
. Art and philosophy are, are part of a

1024
00:72:31.588 --> 00:72:38.890
solution. And um so in a, in one

1025
00:72:38.899 --> 00:72:42.239
way, I'm very, you can think of my

1026
00:72:42.250 --> 00:72:44.149
book. It has many I'm doing, I'm doing

1027
00:72:44.159 --> 00:72:45.699
different things in the book. But one of the

1028
00:72:45.708 --> 00:72:50.859
things I'm doing is I'm making an argument against uh

1029
00:72:53.369 --> 00:72:58.298
the sort of the stem worldview, science, technology

1030
00:72:58.310 --> 00:73:00.640
, engineering, mathematics as if that's, that's,

1031
00:73:01.680 --> 00:73:09.470
that's the important thing and I appreciate that um not

1032
00:73:09.479 --> 00:73:11.819
everybody can be a philosopher, not everybody can be

1033
00:73:12.609 --> 00:73:15.048
an artist, just as not everybody can be a

1034
00:73:15.060 --> 00:73:16.329
science or an engineer or a scientist or an engineer

1035
00:73:16.628 --> 00:73:19.989
. But um it does seem to me that um

1036
00:73:20.128 --> 00:73:24.659
if we neglect science and our, our situation is

1037
00:73:24.668 --> 00:73:28.470
very helpless, excuse me for neglect philosophy and art

1038
00:73:28.708 --> 00:73:33.668
, the situation is very helpless. So, yeah

1039
00:73:33.680 --> 00:73:39.579
, so perhaps that would be a good note to

1040
00:73:39.588 --> 00:73:42.458
end on. Uh the book is again the entanglement

1041
00:73:42.470 --> 00:73:45.930
, sorry, a very sad and depressing note,

1042
00:73:45.939 --> 00:73:46.939
I suppose. But in a way, I mean

1043
00:73:46.949 --> 00:73:49.128
, it to be a positive, a positive note

1044
00:73:49.140 --> 00:73:53.000
and I'm singing the praises of art and philosophy.

1045
00:73:54.458 --> 00:74:00.069
Yes. So the book is again the entanglement how

1046
00:74:00.079 --> 00:74:03.069
art and philosophy make us what we are. I'm

1047
00:74:03.079 --> 00:74:06.189
leaving a link with in the description box of the

1048
00:74:06.199 --> 00:74:11.029
interview and doctor. No. Uh Just before we

1049
00:74:11.039 --> 00:74:13.918
go apart from the book, would you like to

1050
00:74:13.930 --> 00:74:16.390
tell people where they can find you when your work

1051
00:74:16.399 --> 00:74:19.168
on the internet? Oh, yeah, thank you

1052
00:74:19.449 --> 00:74:23.989
. I had a uh um I teach at the

1053
00:74:24.000 --> 00:74:27.930
University of California in Berkeley and um you can,

1054
00:74:27.939 --> 00:74:30.869
you can Google me and find my website. Uh

1055
00:74:30.020 --> 00:74:32.918
There, I actually have a private website as well

1056
00:74:32.930 --> 00:74:38.878
. Albano.com. So it's my www albano.com. Um

1057
00:74:39.270 --> 00:74:41.838
I'm on uh I'm on what used to be called

1058
00:74:41.850 --> 00:74:46.689
Twitter at Albano. Um And in addition to my

1059
00:74:46.699 --> 00:74:50.600
post at Berkeley, I'm currently an Einstein, visiting

1060
00:74:50.609 --> 00:74:54.779
fellow at the Free University in Berlin. So I

1061
00:74:54.789 --> 00:74:58.789
spend a chunk of time running an art and philosophy

1062
00:74:58.798 --> 00:75:01.329
project there. Um And so I can also be

1063
00:75:01.338 --> 00:75:06.890
contacted through um through uh the Free University. Um

1064
00:75:06.899 --> 00:75:10.449
And for, for those of you in Germany or

1065
00:75:10.458 --> 00:75:14.458
in Europe. Ok, great. So, Doctor

1066
00:75:14.470 --> 00:75:15.819
