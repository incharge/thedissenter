00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.610
the Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs

3
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.159
. And today I'm here for a second time with

4
00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.898
Doctor Bernard Bernard Regin, he's Professor of Philosophy at

5
00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:17.620
Brown University. So in our previous interview, we

6
00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:20.359
talked about his book, The Affirmation of Life Nietzsche

7
00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:23.589
on overcoming nihilism. And I'm leaving a link to

8
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.239
it in the description box of this interview. And

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.138
today we're talking about another one of his books,

10
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.340
uh The Will To Nothingness, an essay on Nietzsche's

11
00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:37.139
on the genealogy of morality. So, Doctor Regin

12
00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.098
, welcome back to the show. It's always a

13
00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.289
pleasure to have everyone. Thank you. The pleasure

14
00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:45.149
is mine, Ricardo. So uh to start our

15
00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:50.289
conversation with um what is basically the premise of on

16
00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:54.939
the genealogy of morality by Nietzsche. Well, the

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.649
genus of moti is uh unlike most of other niches

18
00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:00.668
, books in, in so far as it seems

19
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.409
to have a very determinate focus, which is a

20
00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:11.058
uh a critical examination of uh Christian morality as uh

21
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.500
which is the uh uh the moral look that started

22
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.799
with Christianity. But that then uh is the basic

23
00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:25.930
inspiration for uh the uh the modern circular variants of

24
00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.159
it are in the enlightenment, especially the morality of

25
00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:32.370
human rights. For example, I mean, any

26
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:36.540
a moral outlook that basically considers that uh uh each

27
00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.388
and every human being possesses an equal moral standing and

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.409
as such is entitled to basic respect and consideration.

29
00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.609
Um not despite its tight focus and its uh its

30
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.808
seeming systematic shape. Uh The book is uh still

31
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.659
uh created a great deal of puzzlement. So,

32
00:01:56.668 --> 00:01:59.338
uh there's a Bernard Williams for, for example,

33
00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.010
famously described it as a book that uh on the

34
00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:04.680
one hand seems to be hitting on something with great

35
00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.629
exactitude, but on the other also remains infuriatingly vague

36
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.159
. These are his words. Um So the purpose

37
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.699
of my book was to try to uh understand uh

38
00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:22.599
what kind of uh argument, uh especially critical argument

39
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.669
Nietzsche develops against Christian Mor. I mean, Nietzsche

40
00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:30.118
is famous for uh attacking Christian morality for calling it

41
00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.838
into question. But uh there's a, there remains

42
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.649
a great deal of controversy and puzzlement as to what

43
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.939
exactly he finds objectionable about it. Uh And what

44
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.719
does it mean to call the genealogy of morality uh

45
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:53.389
form of epistemic debunking. What does that mean exactly

46
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.389
? Well, so the, the, the most

47
00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.038
, well, one of the most puzzling aspects of

48
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.750
Nietzsche's project in that book is that he claims to

49
00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:09.860
be able to derive normative conclusions about Christian morality from

50
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:14.879
a historical investigation into its origin and development, a

51
00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.149
genealogy of it so to speak. And uh philosophers

52
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.028
have long puzzled over uh how that argument could work

53
00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:25.189
. I mean, uh so people worried that Nietzsche

54
00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.219
was committing a famous fallacy known as the genetic fallacy

55
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.909
, which is the idea that you could uh imper

56
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.528
the truth of a statement by looking at the way

57
00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:39.368
the statements, the statement came about. Uh So

58
00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.379
obviously, that's a fallacy. But uh philosophers have

59
00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.490
since then reconsidered gene arguments and one of the most

60
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.099
influential forms uh that argument has been given is the

61
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.569
form of epistemic debunking. So the idea is that

62
00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.588
uh you cannot show that the belief is false by

63
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.449
examining the way in which the belief came about.

64
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.189
But you can raise questions about whether the agent who

65
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.889
holds the belief, uh a belief that is being

66
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.758
formed in this particular way is actually justified in holding

67
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.024
the belief, that's what's known as epistemic debunking.

68
00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:19.634
So if you find that we believe as a certain

69
00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:23.795
kind of history that for example, it came about

70
00:04:23.803 --> 00:04:27.634
through the operation of mechanisms and processes that are not

71
00:04:27.644 --> 00:04:30.173
epistemic reliable, that are not the kinds of things

72
00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:32.074
that usually track the truth about the world. Then

73
00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:34.634
it gives you a reason to reduce the confidence that

74
00:04:34.644 --> 00:04:38.269
you place in the belief. So, so that's

75
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:42.389
one form of uh this one form of uh uh

76
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:45.470
one way of interpreting Genea arguments that has been attributed

77
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.750
to Nietzsche. I don't think uh as you know

78
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.588
, I I don't think ultimately, this is uh

79
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.298
this is what Nietzsche uh uh takes his critique of

80
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.250
morality to consist of. He doesn't simply try to

81
00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.559
show that uh uh people who hold, who subscribe

82
00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.528
to Christian morality in fact, are on thin epistemic

83
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.019
grant when they do so. And when it comes

84
00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:15.000
to the approach Nietzsche uses in this book to tackle

85
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.259
the genealogy of morality. Would you say it is

86
00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:21.608
a naturalistic one? Well, it's naturalistic in the

87
00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:27.449
sense that he tries to avoid any kind in his

88
00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.298
explanation of what moral it is, how it came

89
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.858
about and so on and so forth. He tries

90
00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.920
to avoid any kind of reference to factors that are

91
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:38.088
not part of nature, that are not the kinds

92
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.988
of factors that could be observed recorded documented by the

93
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.750
natural sciences where by natural sciences that includes what we

94
00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.059
would call the social sciences like psychology, for example

95
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.160
. And so in that respect, his approach is

96
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.129
in fact naturalistic. So he gives an explanation of

97
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.358
how Mo came about that doesn't involve the operation of

98
00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:10.939
entities such as God that doesn't involve our possession of

99
00:06:11.048 --> 00:06:15.108
special properties like freedom of will, that doesn't involve

100
00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:23.509
positing normative facts or entities that could not be observed

101
00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:26.829
and known by the use of the methods of natural

102
00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:30.028
sciences and so on and so forth. Mhm And

103
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.119
what this functionality mean in the context of morality.

104
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:41.809
Well, so the my approach to uh uh to

105
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.639
the genealogical explanation of uh of certain judgments is uh

106
00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:51.670
uh differs from uh uh uh from the, the

107
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.459
, the, the, the epistemic approach that you

108
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.238
mentioned earlier, right? So, uh Nietzsche,

109
00:06:58.048 --> 00:07:00.600
so, so for the people who hold the epistemic

110
00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:04.588
view niche is in the business of calling into question

111
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.189
whether our moral beliefs, we have reasons to take

112
00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.829
our moral beliefs to be true or not. But

113
00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:13.149
in fact, Nietzsche, on a number of occasions

114
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.709
, deny that what's important about beliefs in general.

115
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.809
But moral beliefs in particular is whether or not they

116
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.838
are true, as he famously says, what's new

117
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.769
about my approach is that whether a judgment is true

118
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.189
is not what's important, you know, what is

119
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:33.000
important in his view is uh what it does to

120
00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.939
the individual who holds the belief, to hold that

121
00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.189
belief, what kind of, what kind of a

122
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.399
functional benefit that person or the group to which that

123
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.928
person belongs by derive from uh from holding that particular

124
00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:53.119
belief. So the issue, when you look at

125
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.670
the moral belief on each a like, for example

126
00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:57.588
, it is good to help the needy. The

127
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.470
issue is not whether or not the belief is true

128
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.949
, whether it tracks certain normative objective facts about uh

129
00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:09.019
the, the value or the rightness of helping the

130
00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:13.389
needy. But the question is whether uh it is

131
00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:20.428
useful for individuals to hold and govern their lives by

132
00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.399
the light of such beliefs. So that's what he

133
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.350
means by, that's what I mean by a functional

134
00:08:26.358 --> 00:08:31.238
approach. And so Nietzsche's ultimate claim is that while

135
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.109
more Christian moral beliefs have a kind of uh functionality

136
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:39.548
, that functionality is somehow defective, that's the claim

137
00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:39.759
that I want to make at the end of the

138
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:48.249
day. And all those Nietzsche uh approach moralities psychologically

139
00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:52.830
. Well, so he famously says in, uh

140
00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:56.849
in, he doesn't say so directly in the gene

141
00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:58.048
energy of morality. But uh he says so in

142
00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:00.750
the book that he wrote right before, which is

143
00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:01.369
Beyond Good and evil. And then he says it

144
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:05.239
again uh in books that directly follow the general morality

145
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.450
, such as for example, the twilight of the

146
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.139
idols, he famously says that moralities in general are

147
00:09:13.729 --> 00:09:18.849
a sign language of effects. Uh And there's a

148
00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:22.529
, there's a of course, a big discussion in

149
00:09:22.538 --> 00:09:24.859
the scholarly tera as to what exactly he means by

150
00:09:24.869 --> 00:09:30.418
this. Well, the standard view is that Nietzsche

151
00:09:30.619 --> 00:09:35.940
simply is advocating here a kind of sentimentalism about value

152
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.918
and sentimentalism about value is I mean, it,

153
00:09:37.928 --> 00:09:41.330
it, it has several dimensions. But basically,

154
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.989
it's the idea that uh when I make a more

155
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.918
judgment such as helping the needy is right. Uh

156
00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:54.219
I express uh a sentiment that I have towards uh

157
00:09:54.599 --> 00:09:58.570
neediness or towards the act of helping the needy.

158
00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:03.678
So a sentiment of aversion towards neediness and a sentiment

159
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.700
of inclination towards the act of helping the needy and

160
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.048
relieving them of their suffering. Uh So that's a

161
00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:13.058
standard view now, uh I, you know,

162
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.058
I I argue and we cannot go into the detail

163
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.288
because there are some technical details involved here. But

164
00:10:18.298 --> 00:10:20.950
I argue that this cannot possibly be by what uh

165
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.989
what Nietzsche has in mind when he says that moralities

166
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.918
are a sign language of the fact. Uh If

167
00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:33.418
only because uh the effects that are supposed to explain

168
00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:37.599
the moral judgments do not uh connect especially in each

169
00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:39.779
particular examples uh with one another in the way that

170
00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:43.609
they should, if he were just an ordinary sentimentalist

171
00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:48.369
about uh about moral judgments, uh by the way

172
00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:50.739
, that sentimentalist about moral judgment is a view that

173
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.489
was uh fairly well known, at least in,

174
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.658
in, in British philosophy from the uh 17th and

175
00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:01.288
18th century. Uh And so, if, if

176
00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:03.989
Nietzsche simply were borrowing their views, you would have

177
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.139
expected him to at least acknowledge as much, but

178
00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:09.869
he doesn't. And it's because I think that the

179
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.599
connection that he thinks that he takes there to be

180
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:20.570
between more judgments and affect states is not an expressive

181
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.269
relation as it will have to be in sentimentalism,

182
00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:26.000
but a functional relation. The idea being that uh

183
00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:31.269
uh in his view, more judgments can be understood

184
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:35.340
in terms of the particular role they play in the

185
00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:39.859
effective lives of the agents who holds all those judgments

186
00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:41.359
and live by them. For example, in terms

187
00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:46.330
of the whatever uh effective benefits uh holding those judgments

188
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.590
might have for them, uh the benefits, for

189
00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:52.849
example, in uh fulfilling certain effective needs they may

190
00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:58.058
have. And of course, uh Nietzsche in his

191
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.250
philosophy talks a lot about one particular kind of effect

192
00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:07.250
that he names re Sanima. So what is the

193
00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:13.548
role that uh Reima plays in the way he understands

194
00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:16.899
morality? Well, so, yeah, so the

195
00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:18.899
, the, the concept of reima plays a very

196
00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:22.750
prominent role in the gender of m niche. Doesn't

197
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:26.590
DJ doesn't talk much about it before he writes that

198
00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:31.479
book. Uh But the, the, the concept

199
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:35.239
itself is probably present because he, he clearly seems

200
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.038
it's, it's a bit mysterious exactly how these two

201
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:41.210
things relate. But uh clearly thinks that uh Reiman

202
00:12:41.739 --> 00:12:43.719
is connected to what he calls revengeful. That root

203
00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:48.210
is the motivational state that the emotional state that motivates

204
00:12:48.219 --> 00:12:52.450
revenge. And he talks about revengeful, you know

205
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.219
, from his earlier works on uh but he introduces

206
00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:01.558
the concept of anti specifically in the gender of morality

207
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:03.908
. And it's been a bit of a uh it's

208
00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:07.389
an ongoing question exactly what he means by this.

209
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.979
So the concept of reti is a French word uh

210
00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:16.509
that Nietzsche uses deliberately because uh there are German terms

211
00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:20.019
that are in the vicinity of uh what roti means

212
00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:22.349
. Like the word grow for example. But I

213
00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:28.639
think, and my, my German native German friends

214
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.460
uh tell me so that it does quite capture the

215
00:13:33.469 --> 00:13:37.298
meaning of what in English we call resentment. So

216
00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:39.408
remo is the French word that translates the English resentment

217
00:13:39.908 --> 00:13:45.820
. Now, the problem with claiming that niche when

218
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:46.879
he talks about reso has in mind, what we

219
00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:50.320
in English mean, resentment is that in English,

220
00:13:50.619 --> 00:13:54.038
uh resentment is taken on a very strong moral connotation

221
00:13:54.269 --> 00:14:00.288
. So resentment is uh your response to the fact

222
00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.899
that you have been wronged to the fact that you're

223
00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:05.690
the victim of an injustice, for example. But

224
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.658
it can be what Nietzsche has in mind precisely because

225
00:14:09.668 --> 00:14:16.288
he takes the effect of remo to explain why we

226
00:14:16.298 --> 00:14:18.989
came up with more values and more judgments in the

227
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.590
first place. So it cannot be reso resentment because

228
00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:26.158
resentment presupposes that we already have those beliefs and values

229
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:33.529
. Um So my rough sense is that resent more

230
00:14:33.548 --> 00:14:37.250
uh captures what we in English means resentment. But

231
00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:39.129
what we sometimes mean by resentment when we think of

232
00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:43.558
it as a non moral emotion. So John Stuart

233
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.639
Mill for example, distinguishes between what he calls more

234
00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:48.298
resentment, which is resentment when it is a response

235
00:14:48.308 --> 00:14:52.298
to injustice or wrong from natural resentment, which he

236
00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.928
associates, for example, with revenge. Now,

237
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.379
he doesn't say much about what it is. And

238
00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:00.340
one of the questions for me in the book was

239
00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:03.989
to try to understand uh you know what, what

240
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.619
riot is about what it is responsive to why it

241
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:11.989
motivates revenge and so on and so forth. And

242
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.619
so the basic idea is that uh resent him for

243
00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:20.308
it is linked to uh what he calls the will

244
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.428
to power. When you understand the will to power

245
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.229
as a kind of psychological state, a motivational state

246
00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.649
, you know, like a desire or an inclination

247
00:15:30.658 --> 00:15:33.960
or a drive towards power. But where power is

248
00:15:33.969 --> 00:15:37.399
to be understood in very specific ways, or it's

249
00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:39.219
not to be understood in the way in which it's

250
00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:41.070
usually understood. I mean, when you think about

251
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.440
power, you think about control, you think about

252
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.798
dominance and things of that nature. Uh But what

253
00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:52.070
Nietzsche means by power is uh is, is more

254
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.830
specific than that. The reason is that control and

255
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.408
dominance are things that typically you don't want for their

256
00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:00.879
own sake. There are things that you want for

257
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:02.440
the sake of what they allow you to do.

258
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.759
So uh my having control over a piece of territory

259
00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:07.590
over the people, you know, allow me to

260
00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:11.719
make sure that they do my bidding uh Same with

261
00:16:11.729 --> 00:16:14.769
dominance. But Nietzsche clearly seems to think that power

262
00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:15.908
is something that we want for its own sake.

263
00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:18.899
Something that's the object of an intrinsic desire to use

264
00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:22.678
that terminology. And so what you need is an

265
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.070
understanding of power that makes it intelligible that this is

266
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.889
something that you would want for its own sake.

267
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.149
And so the idea that I have and it,

268
00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:34.269
it draws on some of the metaphors that Nietzsche uses

269
00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:38.269
in his discussion of power. Uh is that power

270
00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:41.450
is the fact of having your presence in the world

271
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.308
make a causal difference in it. It's the idea

272
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.668
of making your mark on the world or making the

273
00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:52.080
world reflect uh reflect your presence in it where your

274
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.418
presence in it is your presence under a specific description

275
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.629
. So for example, in the case of human

276
00:16:57.639 --> 00:17:02.369
beings, your presence as an agent with a will

277
00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:04.519
, particular values, particular aspirations and so on and

278
00:17:04.529 --> 00:17:08.630
so forth. So at a certain point there you

279
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.098
mentioned revengeful. So and Nietzsche in his book talks

280
00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.098
about Christianity or Christian morality as an act of revenge

281
00:17:19.108 --> 00:17:22.680
. What does that mean? Exactly? Ah,

282
00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:27.959
that's the 65,000$64,000 question. Uh uh That's,

283
00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:30.328
that's really the, I mean, the most arresting

284
00:17:30.338 --> 00:17:33.608
claim of the book. I mean, that Christian

285
00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:34.900
morality, the invention of Christian morality is an act

286
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.719
of revenge and it's puzzling in all kinds of ways

287
00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:42.729
, right? It's puzzling in the first instance because

288
00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:48.140
when you think about revenge in the paradigmatic cases,

289
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.949
you think about my wanting to make somebody suffer because

290
00:17:51.959 --> 00:17:52.969
they have made me suffer, you know, uh

291
00:17:52.979 --> 00:17:56.368
think about revenge as violent retaliation of some kind.

292
00:17:56.739 --> 00:18:00.209
But, but the invention of Christian morality is,

293
00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.930
is not a violent retaliation. It's uh it's basically

294
00:18:03.939 --> 00:18:07.568
the devising of a new moral outlook. So,

295
00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:11.000
so it's very hard to say to begin with how

296
00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:12.949
this, the invention of certain values could count as

297
00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.259
revenge in the first place. So, so that

298
00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.848
already shows that when, when he thinks about revenge

299
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.979
. Niche must have a fairly capacious understanding of it

300
00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:25.088
. And in fact, if you start scoring his

301
00:18:25.098 --> 00:18:30.068
works for uh uh for instances in which he uses

302
00:18:30.078 --> 00:18:33.670
the concept of revenge, you realize that he,

303
00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:36.670
he he he takes the concept of revenge uh to

304
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.910
have a very broad meaning. So for example,

305
00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:41.729
acts of gratitude can be acts of revenge for him

306
00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:45.068
. Acts of forgiveness. Christian forgiveness. He describes

307
00:18:45.078 --> 00:18:48.279
explicit ingen, it can be an act of revenge

308
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:49.920
. Acts of beneficence can be acts of revenge.

309
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.578
And then he also argues that you can take revenge

310
00:18:55.588 --> 00:18:56.868
, not just against other people, but you can

311
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.729
take revenge against impersonal entities like life. So in

312
00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.789
the third essay of the genealogy, he says that

313
00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:07.729
the invention of asceticism was an act of revenge against

314
00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:11.713
life. You can revenge against time, you can

315
00:19:11.723 --> 00:19:14.934
take revenge against reality for NC. So, so

316
00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:18.384
it's very, very puzzling, right? So my

317
00:19:18.394 --> 00:19:21.434
, my thought here, my driving thought and by

318
00:19:21.443 --> 00:19:22.463
the way, I'm writing a new book about revenge

319
00:19:22.473 --> 00:19:26.785
just in order to clarify those issues at the moment

320
00:19:26.824 --> 00:19:33.338
. But my driving thought is that so Simon is

321
00:19:33.348 --> 00:19:37.318
the response that you have when uh uh your,

322
00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:41.039
your power, the sense that your presence in the

323
00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:45.279
world is, doesn't make a difference in it or

324
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:48.809
doesn't make the difference that you expect uh is,

325
00:19:48.828 --> 00:19:52.170
is, is challenged. It's called into question,

326
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.900
it's called into doubt. OK. So resentment is

327
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.068
so to speak. Uh uh a fight response against

328
00:20:00.078 --> 00:20:02.689
doubts raised about your power. So for example,

329
00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:04.568
when somebody treats you as if you're nothing, when

330
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.729
they make you suffer, they, they, they

331
00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:08.680
, they disregard your will and so on and so

332
00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:14.368
forth. That's a paradigmatic instance in which uh you're

333
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.049
liable to feel or to be made to feel impotent

334
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.449
. And one of the response that you can have

335
00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:22.890
of course is shame, which is when you withdraw

336
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.318
, when you, when you uh when you submit

337
00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:27.140
, when you comply or you can have, which

338
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.289
is a flight response or you can have a fight

339
00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:32.170
response, which is to respond and to try to

340
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.709
assert your power, for example, by making suffer

341
00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:37.199
, the person who has made you suffer by imposing

342
00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:41.299
your will upon theirs after they have imposed their will

343
00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:45.680
upon yours. OK. So, so revenge uh

344
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:48.680
is the act whereby you attempt to restore your power

345
00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:52.269
in that sense? OK. So the question is

346
00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:55.930
, well, how could the invention of new values

347
00:20:56.818 --> 00:21:00.098
constitute an act of revenge for the right? Well

348
00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:00.568
, so the idea is this right? There are

349
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:03.328
, there are two elements to power, right?

350
00:21:03.338 --> 00:21:06.789
So, so power is you want your presence in

351
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.180
the world to make a difference in it? But

352
00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:11.098
the second element is that you want your presence in

353
00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:15.019
the world under a certain description. OK. So

354
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:18.680
what I am is an agent with a certain kind

355
00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:21.299
of will with my my will. In this case

356
00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:23.519
, for niche is the repository of my values,

357
00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:26.949
my aspiration, what I consider to be important.

358
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:30.489
So what it is for me to have power or

359
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.939
to feel as though I have power is that I

360
00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:37.618
am able to make it so that the world around

361
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.680
me reflect my presence in it. For example,

362
00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:42.959
by realizing my values, you know, and I'm

363
00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:47.239
liable to feel as though I am important. If

364
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.769
my will, my values and my pursuit of them

365
00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:52.400
, my agency make no difference in that world.

366
00:21:53.250 --> 00:22:00.209
So the idea is that our Christianity for each or

367
00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:03.588
at least Christian morality is an act of revenge for

368
00:22:03.598 --> 00:22:07.750
people whose will has made no difference in the world

369
00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:08.559
. But they, but they, they realize that

370
00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:14.199
they have no option in order to be, become

371
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.348
able to make a difference in the world other than

372
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.868
by altering the contents of their will by altering the

373
00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:25.368
description under which they want to make a difference in

374
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.880
the world. Ok? So the idea is that

375
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.920
, well, look, if you can't bend the

376
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.019
world to your will, maybe you can change your

377
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:34.259
will so that whatever it is that you can do

378
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.219
will count as bending the world to your will.

379
00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:41.848
So changing your values is like changing what is going

380
00:22:41.858 --> 00:22:44.328
to count as power for you. Ok? And

381
00:22:44.338 --> 00:22:47.078
in this case, if the motivation is to restore

382
00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:48.759
your feeling of power, to make it the case

383
00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:52.160
again, that you can feel as though your presence

384
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.519
in the world makes a difference in it. Then

385
00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:56.170
the invention of Christian morality is an act of revenge

386
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.680
. And so what would be the goals of revenge

387
00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:06.709
in Christian morality? Does it have any specific goals

388
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:08.959
or not? Well, ok, so, so

389
00:23:10.078 --> 00:23:12.959
a big question when you think about revenge in general

390
00:23:12.969 --> 00:23:15.640
is precisely the question of what the goal of revenge

391
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.509
is, right? I mean, so again,

392
00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:22.439
the paradigmatic instance is that you caused me to suffer

393
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:27.229
and my revenge, my retaliation is to make you

394
00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:30.348
suffer because you made me suffer. And then the

395
00:23:30.358 --> 00:23:33.059
question is well, but what do I get out

396
00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:34.670
of this? Ok. So you made me suffer

397
00:23:34.699 --> 00:23:37.660
and I made you suffer in return, I retaliate

398
00:23:37.828 --> 00:23:40.949
. What's the purpose of my retaliation? What do

399
00:23:40.959 --> 00:23:44.969
I accomplish with that retaliation? What do I achieve

400
00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:47.219
or what is my aim in retaliating? What am

401
00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:49.338
I trying to achieve when I retaliate? So that's

402
00:23:49.348 --> 00:23:52.430
a, that's a difficult question. And for this

403
00:23:52.439 --> 00:24:00.489
has that question I think has motivated are the view

404
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.170
that many philosophers take up to this day, which

405
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.750
consists in treating revenge as a kind of punishment.

406
00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:10.719
So, so revenge is basically punishment. But in

407
00:24:10.729 --> 00:24:15.180
circumstances where there are no institutions of justice capable of

408
00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:18.289
meeting out the punishment so that the individual him or

409
00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:22.098
herself has, as we say, to take the

410
00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:25.098
law into his own hands or into her own hands

411
00:24:25.108 --> 00:24:26.799
. OK. So revenge in this way to use

412
00:24:26.809 --> 00:24:32.000
Francis Bacon's famous phrase is wild justice. It's justice

413
00:24:32.009 --> 00:24:36.189
, it aims at justice but in conditions in wild

414
00:24:36.199 --> 00:24:40.068
conditions or conditions of wilderness. Ok. So you

415
00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:42.799
know, uh the American Western movies, for example

416
00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:45.088
, is, you know, is almost always about

417
00:24:45.098 --> 00:24:48.989
revenge. But in this case, you can say

418
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.400
that it's revenge. It's wild that this revenge is

419
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.299
wild justice because what they try to, to achieve

420
00:24:53.309 --> 00:24:57.088
is justice. But under conditions of wilderness where there

421
00:24:57.098 --> 00:25:00.828
are no institutions, there's no effective police institution,

422
00:25:00.838 --> 00:25:04.420
there's no system of justice and the individual has to

423
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.858
then you know, be the judge and the executioner

424
00:25:07.868 --> 00:25:15.098
him or herself. Um Now again, if revenge

425
00:25:15.108 --> 00:25:18.949
aimed at justice for Nietzsche, then it would Presuppose

426
00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:22.338
the morality that he thinks is created by revenge.

427
00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:25.818
So Nietzsche must have an understanding of revenge, which

428
00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:27.769
is not moral or not moralized in that way.

429
00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:32.430
And in fact, there are some philosophers uh who

430
00:25:32.439 --> 00:25:36.838
have argued that revenge does not aim at justice that

431
00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.719
uh if you, if you make me suffer,

432
00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:41.259
uh when I take revenge, I don't come true

433
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:42.930
. You're making me suffer as a wrong or as

434
00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:45.759
an injustice. And then my retaliation would be a

435
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:48.568
form of punishment. Something else is going on.

436
00:25:49.088 --> 00:25:51.858
But then that's the mystery. What else is going

437
00:25:51.868 --> 00:25:55.689
on if when I retaliate against you for having made

438
00:25:55.699 --> 00:25:59.108
me suffer, I'm not, my aim is not

439
00:25:59.118 --> 00:26:00.979
to punish you. My aim is not for example

440
00:26:00.989 --> 00:26:03.390
, to deter you from doing something wrong. My

441
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.588
aim is not to make sure you don't get away

442
00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:07.348
with it, that you get what you deserve.

443
00:26:07.769 --> 00:26:11.930
My aim must be something else. And the question

444
00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:12.299
is, well, what is the aim of revenge

445
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:15.088
? And my, my idea is that the aim

446
00:26:15.098 --> 00:26:18.430
of revenge again is, you know, power in

447
00:26:18.439 --> 00:26:21.219
the specific sense in which I understand it. It's

448
00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:26.368
to uh restoring yourself the sense that your presence in

449
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.949
the world makes a difference in it. And the

450
00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:30.318
idea, the reason why this is not more is

451
00:26:30.328 --> 00:26:36.140
because this, this need for power is a very

452
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:41.979
fundamental, very basic psychological need uh which is connected

453
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.858
in my view, I mean, II, I

454
00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:45.459
can try to explain this to you but uh uh

455
00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:49.568
but it's connected with uh the importance uh of um

456
00:26:49.848 --> 00:26:52.979
it's connected with our, our feeling of existence,

457
00:26:52.989 --> 00:26:55.848
our sense that we are, as we say in

458
00:26:55.868 --> 00:26:56.578
, I agree, we are somebody, you know

459
00:26:56.588 --> 00:27:00.729
, some people feel like I'm a nobody. And

460
00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:03.029
what it usually means is that when they feel like

461
00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:04.489
they are nobodies, it is because they feel that

462
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.410
their presence in the world makes no difference in it

463
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.309
. They don't accomplish anything, they are done,

464
00:27:11.318 --> 00:27:14.568
they go unnoticed, they are invisible to others and

465
00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:18.189
so on and so forth. And sometimes in those

466
00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:22.199
circumstances, they will react revengefully, they will want

467
00:27:22.209 --> 00:27:26.000
to do something that changes their sense of themselves as

468
00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:26.789
nobody is. They will make them feel like they

469
00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:32.269
are somebody Uh So I think that the aim of

470
00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:34.578
revenge when it's considered, you know, uh a

471
00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:40.789
non moral impulse is this, it's what Nietzsche calls

472
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:45.838
power. So earlier, we've talked about uh functionality

473
00:27:45.848 --> 00:27:49.439
. Would you say that, uh Christian morality or

474
00:27:49.449 --> 00:27:56.489
the Christian moral outlook is itself functional? Well,

475
00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:57.318
yes. So the, the, the function,

476
00:27:57.328 --> 00:28:00.799
so reti is an effective state, you know,

477
00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:02.799
remember that niche claims, I mean, the,

478
00:28:02.809 --> 00:28:06.068
the, the sort of the, the view of

479
00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:10.410
moral belief or morality or moral judgment that uh uh

480
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.509
that underlies niches project in the genealogy. Is this

481
00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:18.009
idea that moralities are sign language of effects that mm

482
00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:22.068
more judgments or, or systems of moral judgments.

483
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.318
Uh Excuse me, my, my, my dog

484
00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:26.118
is making some noise there. I don't know,

485
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.469
no worries. No, no, no, no

486
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:33.239
. Uh So moralities and moral judgments are, are

487
00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:36.689
, you know, um uh not expressions of effects

488
00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:38.019
but they are, they are uh they are causally

489
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:42.959
related to those effects underlying Nietzsche's approach to Christian morality

490
00:28:42.969 --> 00:28:45.269
in the, in the g of Mor is the

491
00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:49.380
idea that uh uh more judgments, more beliefs,

492
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:55.699
more concepts uh have a certain kind of uh functional

493
00:28:55.709 --> 00:29:02.088
role to play in the effective emotional economy of agents

494
00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:03.838
. OK. So uh you know, my holding

495
00:29:03.848 --> 00:29:07.729
a certain belief like helping the needy is good or

496
00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:10.309
my holding a certain conception of what justice is and

497
00:29:10.318 --> 00:29:12.209
so on and so forth. All of these things

498
00:29:12.328 --> 00:29:15.949
are, are, can be, can be understood

499
00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:19.430
as being in some sense designed to play a certain

500
00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:23.229
kind of role in my emotional economy uh to,

501
00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:27.519
to uh satisfy certain emotional needs. Now, the

502
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:30.358
question is, well, what is the emotional need

503
00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:33.390
that's being satisfied by uh by Christian morality? And

504
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.828
according to Nietzsche, the emotional need that's being satisfied

505
00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:40.368
is the emotional need that's expressed uh or enshrined in

506
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.068
the effect of resentment. It's the need to feel

507
00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:45.640
as though your presence in the world makes a difference

508
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.189
in it. And again, your presence in the

509
00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:52.130
world un under a certain description. OK. So

510
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.289
uh and there are various ways in which it does

511
00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:56.519
that, right? So uh so one of the

512
00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:00.759
, the chief uh characteristics of Christian morality, this

513
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:06.848
notion that every single human being, regardless of origin

514
00:30:06.858 --> 00:30:11.309
, regardless of uh circumstance, it has more status

515
00:30:11.318 --> 00:30:15.930
and as such is entitled to uh to respect and

516
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:22.729
consideration. Uh And that's a way in which uh

517
00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:25.828
uh so if you, if you believe that,

518
00:30:26.108 --> 00:30:30.400
then it dispenses you in order to uh to feel

519
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:30.799
as though your presence in the world can make a

520
00:30:30.809 --> 00:30:33.229
difference and it dispenses you from having to do anything

521
00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:37.920
. OK? Because because you're entitled to the,

522
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.029
the kind of respect and recognition or notice from others

523
00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:45.299
uh in virtue of being who you are not in

524
00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:48.739
virtue of your being able to do something. So

525
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.509
if you live in a, in a culture where

526
00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.358
where your status is linked to your, for example

527
00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:57.239
, achievement such as for example, the honor cultures

528
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:02.289
of Ancient Rome, where your, your, your

529
00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:06.180
, your excuse me, your um uh your immoral

530
00:31:06.189 --> 00:31:10.818
status, your honor was linked to your political and

531
00:31:10.828 --> 00:31:14.828
martial prowess. For example, then in order to

532
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:15.789
in order to have your presence in the world,

533
00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:18.068
make a difference in it. In order to have

534
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:22.489
to enjoy notice and recognition, you have to do

535
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.449
certain things. But of course, if you're not

536
00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:26.608
capable, if you don't have the capacities, for

537
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:30.029
example, to uh handle weapons, to be good

538
00:31:30.039 --> 00:31:32.108
at fighting and so on and so forth, then

539
00:31:32.118 --> 00:31:33.838
you risk, you know, being a nobody literally

540
00:31:34.219 --> 00:31:36.759
. So one of the ways in which you can

541
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:38.199
begin to change this, it's not sufficient, but

542
00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:40.709
one of the ways in which you can begin to

543
00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:44.318
change this is by changing values and by changing what's

544
00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:48.170
counts as worthy of recognition, for example. Mhm

545
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.509
uh And so could you tell us now about uh

546
00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:56.509
the concepts of slave morality and master morality as Nietzsche

547
00:31:56.739 --> 00:32:02.289
understood them and as Nietzsche used them and uh how

548
00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:07.328
do they apply to an understanding of Christian morality from

549
00:32:07.338 --> 00:32:16.299
his own perspective? Yeah. So uh so again

550
00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:20.680
, those concepts are very loose in niche and they

551
00:32:20.689 --> 00:32:23.368
are, they connect to various things. I think

552
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:31.029
that the, the dominant our strain uh in distinguishing

553
00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:35.250
between these two more outlooks for has to do with

554
00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:39.729
the concept of equality. So he famously describes our

555
00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:45.219
master moralities as those moralities in which as he puts

556
00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:49.930
it, there's a difference in value between human being

557
00:32:49.939 --> 00:32:52.608
and human being. Not everybody is equal, not

558
00:32:52.618 --> 00:32:55.969
everybody is the same. Some people deserve more consideration

559
00:32:55.979 --> 00:33:00.670
, more recognition, more notice than others. Uh

560
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.880
Or some people are entitled to certain privileges to which

561
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.039
others are not. Ok. So uh what he

562
00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:12.799
clearly is referring to is, well, I mean

563
00:33:12.809 --> 00:33:15.098
, I'm, I'm no historian of morality, but

564
00:33:15.108 --> 00:33:17.039
I, I would imagine that many, many uh

565
00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:22.910
moral outlooks prior to Christianity were probably in egalitarian moral

566
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.118
outlooks were uh for example, slavery was widespread,

567
00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:30.739
slavery was completely normal. And of course, if

568
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.598
you, if you think that some people can be

569
00:33:32.608 --> 00:33:35.358
the slaves of the people, you don't think that

570
00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:37.000
every, every human being by virtue of being a

571
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:40.838
human being has equal worth. OK. So the

572
00:33:40.848 --> 00:33:44.719
, the big innovation of Christian morality for niche is

573
00:33:44.729 --> 00:33:47.660
precisely this idea that of equality, the idea that

574
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:53.739
all human beings are, are equal, uh equal

575
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.598
worth, basic, equal worth, which entitles them

576
00:33:58.608 --> 00:34:01.578
to respect and consideration, maybe passion and so on

577
00:34:01.588 --> 00:34:05.400
and so forth. Uh And that goes straight back

578
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.250
to the idea that every human being is a child

579
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.918
of God and as such, uh you know,

580
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:15.148
deserves a kind as a kind of standing. So

581
00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.119
that's, I think that's, that's the crucial thing

582
00:34:17.128 --> 00:34:21.320
there. If, if you look closely, there

583
00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:27.099
are uh other uh you know, distinctions that you

584
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.708
can draw. So for example, uh I sometimes

585
00:34:30.717 --> 00:34:35.539
suspect that uh the distinction between a master morality,

586
00:34:35.548 --> 00:34:37.708
outlook and a slave morality outlook is the distinction that

587
00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:40.349
we draw today or that sociologist draw today between what's

588
00:34:40.358 --> 00:34:45.467
called a, an honor culture and a dignity culture

589
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:50.599
. Uh We, and you know, sometimes honor

590
00:34:50.608 --> 00:34:54.260
cultures are hierarchical cultures. There are egalitarian cultures and

591
00:34:54.269 --> 00:34:58.148
whereas dignity, cultures are egalitarian cultures, but there's

592
00:34:58.159 --> 00:35:01.300
other distinctions between honor and dignity, for example,

593
00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:06.039
uh dignity, cultures are cultures in which uh you

594
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.699
don't have to do anything in order to be uh

595
00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:12.179
to have status or standing and to deserve a certain

596
00:35:12.188 --> 00:35:15.309
kind of to have certain rights and certain prerogatives.

597
00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:17.929
Whereas in honor cultures, you have to do something

598
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:21.610
, you know. So, so honor, unlike

599
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:24.760
dignity is something that can be lost uh dignity.

600
00:35:24.769 --> 00:35:27.489
I mean, you can behave in any way you

601
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.699
want, you can behave in an undignified manner.

602
00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:31.519
It's not going to change the fact that you have

603
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.530
dignity simply by virtue of being a person. But

604
00:35:35.539 --> 00:35:37.389
if you behave dishonorably, you lose your honor.

605
00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:40.478
So there are other distinctions like that that might operate

606
00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:43.239
in the background of what Nietzsche has in mind.

607
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.349
But it's, it's, it's not easy to tell

608
00:35:45.398 --> 00:35:51.340
. So where do the ideas of good and evil

609
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:54.909
come from according to Nietzsche? Well, so,

610
00:35:55.539 --> 00:36:00.728
so there was um you know, there is a

611
00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:05.878
distinction between good and bad that predates the invention of

612
00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:08.539
Christian morality, right? So in uh in master

613
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:12.360
moralities, you know, the to be good is

614
00:36:12.369 --> 00:36:14.489
to be like the master and to be bad is

615
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.860
to be like, you know, everybody else who's

616
00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:20.469
not a master. Uh So what's distinctive about Christian

617
00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.760
morality is the the switch from that conceptual pairing,

618
00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:27.659
good, bad to good evil. So actually the

619
00:36:27.668 --> 00:36:29.199
question is what, what, what exactly is the

620
00:36:29.208 --> 00:36:32.119
difference? Well, the one chief difference, uh

621
00:36:32.128 --> 00:36:35.320
there, there are several but one chief difference I

622
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:40.110
think has to do with the importance in the application

623
00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:43.949
of the concept of moral evil, of the idea

624
00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:50.239
of a free will. So uh bad in the

625
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.119
context of Christian morality, uh simply refers to uh

626
00:36:54.128 --> 00:36:59.099
what's uh you know, vile, what's ignoble,

627
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.329
what's, you know, uh low and so on

628
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:06.019
and so forth and uh you know, whether you

629
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.260
vile, whether you ignoble is unrelated to whether or

630
00:37:10.269 --> 00:37:15.750
not you are acting freely, for example, OK

631
00:37:15.208 --> 00:37:20.719
. Uh by contrast, uh when you describe at

632
00:37:20.728 --> 00:37:23.269
least in a strict sense, when you describe uh

633
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:29.708
an action as morally evil, it is essential that

634
00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:34.668
uh you suppose that the person who perpetrated that action

635
00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:37.429
did so freely, uh because if they are not

636
00:37:37.438 --> 00:37:38.610
, if the action was an accident, then it

637
00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:40.539
may be evil in some sense, it may be

638
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.860
because it had bad consequences for example, but it's

639
00:37:43.869 --> 00:37:46.309
not morally evil. OK. It's only if you

640
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:52.989
did something uh that is morally wrong on purpose deliberately

641
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.760
, intentionally, if you did it freely, uh

642
00:37:54.769 --> 00:37:59.559
that you can be uh and therefore that you can

643
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:00.489
be held responsible for it, that the action counts

644
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:06.219
as morally evil. So that's one important uh uh

645
00:38:06.228 --> 00:38:07.530
distinction, that niche. It was, it was

646
00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:12.898
also these a lot Murkier distinctions between uh uh between

647
00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:15.010
good, bad and good evil. And so,

648
00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:15.389
for example, one of the things that he says

649
00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:19.378
is that the pair good evil, unlike the pair

650
00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:23.110
good, bad begins with uh uh an act of

651
00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:27.289
negation, be, be begins with the invention of

652
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.409
evil. So it's as if you, you first

653
00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:34.289
describe some people or some types of action as evil

654
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.570
and then as an afterthought, what's not like that

655
00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:40.269
you characterize as good. Whereas in so called master

656
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.909
moralities, you start out by asserting something as good

657
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.139
and then there's an afterthought, what's not like that

658
00:38:46.148 --> 00:38:52.010
is bad. Uh Exactly what Nietzsche means by this

659
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.010
and he makes a bit of a big deal out

660
00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:58.208
of this way of carving the distinction in, in

661
00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.550
the genealogy is, is a bit unclear. I

662
00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:02.929
have some thoughts about this in the book, but

663
00:39:02.938 --> 00:39:07.250
I'm, I'm not absolutely certain that I have quite

664
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.639
understood. Are there's something interesting going on there,

665
00:39:13.648 --> 00:39:15.050
but it's uh again, I, you know,

666
00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:17.429
I'm not there, there are various ways in which

667
00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:22.059
you can understand it fair enough. Uh And what

668
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.219
would you say is the role that things like guilt

669
00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:30.938
and punishment play? Uh In Nietzsche's account of the

670
00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:36.780
genealogy of morality and perhaps more specifically in Christian morality

671
00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:38.648
. Well, that, that's a, that's a

672
00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:44.260
complicated business. Uh So, uh the genealogy of

673
00:39:44.269 --> 00:39:47.449
morality has, is divided into three essays in the

674
00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:51.039
first essay, this is where he talks most about

675
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.628
resentment and the invention of good and evil, uh

676
00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:57.458
, and things of that nature. And then in

677
00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:00.000
the second and the third essay, the notions of

678
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.360
guilt and punishment figure prominently. I mean, even

679
00:40:01.369 --> 00:40:05.260
in the third essay, which is ostensibly about the

680
00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.579
invention of ascetic ideals there, he says that the

681
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:13.340
central acidic practice consists in interpreting all of your suffering

682
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:15.539
as he puts it under the perspective of guilt.

683
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.429
It is, it's consistent seeing every, every piece

684
00:40:19.438 --> 00:40:22.860
of misfortunes that befalls you every suffering you have to

685
00:40:22.869 --> 00:40:24.878
endure, you have to interpret it as as punishment

686
00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:28.019
for your sins, so to speak. So,

687
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.599
so basically, the third essay really draws very heavily

688
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.250
on what he does on the second essay. So

689
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:37.159
the two essays together form a kind of a conceptual

690
00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.969
whole there. So what's the importance of all of

691
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:43.148
this? Well, that's, that's our, that

692
00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:45.610
took me some time to try to figure out,

693
00:40:45.619 --> 00:40:52.159
right? So one thought uh that I pursued here

694
00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:55.889
is that uh the concept of guilt and the concept

695
00:40:55.898 --> 00:41:00.699
of responsibility that's tied up to it, maybe understood

696
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:05.760
uh are in the context of this, the,

697
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.030
the, the attempt to try to satisfy your need

698
00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:10.418
for power. Uh The, the sense that you

699
00:41:10.429 --> 00:41:15.188
have effectiveness as an agent in sort of uh uh

700
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:19.360
living and making the word reflect your values or your

701
00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:23.260
aspirations. Uh And so the idea is this right

702
00:41:23.269 --> 00:41:27.409
? Uh The idea is that if you do something

703
00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:31.478
that falls short of your values, oh, you

704
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.559
could feel ashamed. But if you feel ashamed,

705
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.579
uh one, I mean, the concept of shame

706
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.739
is a notoriously difficult concept, but one way to

707
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.179
distinguish between shame and guilt is this right when you

708
00:41:44.188 --> 00:41:46.239
feel ashamed because you have failed to live up to

709
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:50.329
your own values. Uh Usually what that means is

710
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.780
that you tried but you, you, you didn't

711
00:41:52.789 --> 00:41:57.599
have what it takes. So your agency lacked effectiveness

712
00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.128
, you lacked power in that sense and that's very

713
00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:04.539
, very difficult to accept. Whereas if you feel

714
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.329
simply guilty, then uh it's true that you fail

715
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:13.469
to live up to your uh to your own values

716
00:42:13.478 --> 00:42:15.369
, you fail to realize them in the way you

717
00:42:15.378 --> 00:42:19.188
live, but you could have done otherwise you had

718
00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:21.208
the power to do it. So in this way

719
00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:23.369
, feeling guilty can be uh an a, a

720
00:42:23.378 --> 00:42:29.099
defense against a much more emotionally damaging feeling of shame

721
00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:32.000
. Ok. So, uh by uh inventing the

722
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:36.599
concept of guilt and then giving it very broad application

723
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:38.949
, you can see that Christian morality plays a role

724
00:42:39.168 --> 00:42:44.750
uh in this or, or has the function of

725
00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.188
uh as it were re restoring or buttressing the feeling

726
00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.719
of power of people in whom that fee is,

727
00:42:51.728 --> 00:42:53.938
uh is under threat. Um OK. So that's

728
00:42:53.949 --> 00:42:57.769
the first thought, the, the second thought to

729
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.679
come to the question of punishment. Now, uh

730
00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:04.510
the second thought has to do with which comes with

731
00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:08.000
a puzzle. So the second essay uh is ostensibly

732
00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:12.300
devoted to a genealogy of the feelings of guilt.

733
00:43:13.418 --> 00:43:15.699
But the problem is that in the first essay,

734
00:43:15.769 --> 00:43:17.829
Nietzsche already has given us, has given us a

735
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.090
genealogy of guilt, you know, by giving us

736
00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:24.000
a genealogy of uh what are the norms of guilt

737
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.159
? I mean, the norms that you have to

738
00:43:25.168 --> 00:43:29.168
violate in order to feel guilty and by giving us

739
00:43:29.179 --> 00:43:31.519
a genealogy of freedom of will cause to feel guilty

740
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:35.750
, you have to feel as though you're responsible for

741
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.570
violating certain norms. No niche gives us uh in

742
00:43:39.579 --> 00:43:42.909
the first essay, a genealogy of the freedom of

743
00:43:42.918 --> 00:43:45.449
will that makes you responsible and the gene energy of

744
00:43:45.458 --> 00:43:47.269
the norms, the violation of which would induce guilt

745
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.869
. So it seems like he has not already give

746
00:43:49.878 --> 00:43:52.070
us the gene of guilt. So what is he

747
00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:52.809
doing then? In the second essay, that's different

748
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.260
from the first. But in the second essay,

749
00:43:55.269 --> 00:43:58.639
what Nietzsche does is that he pursues a very different

750
00:43:58.648 --> 00:44:00.530
line about guilt. And the line that he pursues

751
00:44:00.539 --> 00:44:04.840
has to do with the association that even we draw

752
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:09.159
between uh between guilt and indebtedness. So we,

753
00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:14.320
we talk, for example, about uh being punished

754
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:16.519
for our sins as a way of paying our debts

755
00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.708
. So, so there's a connection there which in

756
00:44:21.719 --> 00:44:24.840
German is actually uh are very strong because the same

757
00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:29.539
word should, can be translated as guilt and has

758
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.800
indebtedness or that in any event. Uh So he's

759
00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:35.429
very interested in this connection. And the reason why

760
00:44:35.438 --> 00:44:37.760
he's interested in the connection is because he's interested in

761
00:44:37.769 --> 00:44:39.869
a particular way in which guilt and punishment can be

762
00:44:39.878 --> 00:44:45.309
related. Uh So typically when we think of punishment

763
00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.679
, I think we tend to think of it in

764
00:44:46.688 --> 00:44:52.260
retributive terms. OK. So you did something wrong

765
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:53.909
. I punish you and my punishing you is retribution

766
00:44:53.918 --> 00:44:55.340
in the sense that all I'm trying to do is

767
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:57.809
to get you what you deserve to make sure you

768
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.599
don't get away with it. That's it. But

769
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.619
if you think of punishment as retribution, it does

770
00:45:02.628 --> 00:45:07.570
not undo the guilt. You know, it doesn't

771
00:45:07.628 --> 00:45:10.530
wash away the guilt, so to speak. But

772
00:45:10.938 --> 00:45:13.849
, and this is especially true Christianity. There's a

773
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.360
way in which punishment can wash away the guilt.

774
00:45:15.989 --> 00:45:17.378
And then the question is, well, how could

775
00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:21.559
that be possible? But if you think about guilt

776
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.679
as indebtedness and you think of punishment as an alternative

777
00:45:25.688 --> 00:45:29.478
way of paying your debt, then you can see

778
00:45:29.489 --> 00:45:31.208
how punishment could wash away the guilt. And this

779
00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:34.739
is the line that Nietzsche explores in that, in

780
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.309
that second essay, you know, so, so

781
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.469
sometimes you can fail to live up to your own

782
00:45:38.478 --> 00:45:42.949
values. And of course, that, you know

783
00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:44.929
, that shows that, you know, you,

784
00:45:44.938 --> 00:45:46.570
you, you maybe you don't have what it takes

785
00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:49.019
to live up to the values. It raises that

786
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.800
question. But if it turns out that you,

787
00:45:52.809 --> 00:45:54.800
you can somehow demonstrate that you have the capacity to

788
00:45:54.809 --> 00:45:58.000
live up to those values, for example, by

789
00:45:58.269 --> 00:46:01.378
undergoing the kind of deprivation that living up to the

790
00:46:01.389 --> 00:46:05.530
values requires of you in the form of punishment or

791
00:46:05.539 --> 00:46:08.269
penance. Then it, it reassures you with regard

792
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.688
to your power. And I think that this is

793
00:46:09.699 --> 00:46:14.820
the line that Nietzsche is pursuing. So before we

794
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:19.110
get into the will to nothingness itself, that gives

795
00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:21.869
title to your book, let me just ask you

796
00:46:21.878 --> 00:46:27.159
about another topic. So what are Nietzsche's thoughts on

797
00:46:27.168 --> 00:46:37.418
aestheticism? So, one of the striking features of

798
00:46:37.429 --> 00:46:42.829
Christian morality and even the secular variants of Christian morality

799
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.039
that were developed in the enlightenment and they're a roughly

800
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.938
defined moral look with which we at least in the

801
00:46:47.949 --> 00:46:53.309
Western world live these days. Uh is that to

802
00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.579
act morally, is not necessarily good for you.

803
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.599
OK? To act morally. Uh You may have

804
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.648
to uh to do things that are not in your

805
00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:07.489
best interest, you may have to do to uh

806
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.639
undergo uh or you may have to do things that

807
00:47:12.648 --> 00:47:14.239
are going to harm you that are going to be

808
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.958
bad for you in that sense. Uh That's uh

809
00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:20.909
it's a new idea. I mean, for the

810
00:47:20.918 --> 00:47:22.579
Ancient Greeks, for example, it's very striking that

811
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.809
uh the reasons to act in ways that they consider

812
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.688
more to act virtuously is that it's good for you

813
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.590
? Ok. So in Aristotle and virtue, ethics

814
00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:35.688
is like that, you know, why should I

815
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.469
, you know, uh, be good to my

816
00:47:37.478 --> 00:47:39.050
friends, for example, why should I treat other

817
00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:42.728
people with, in, in the ways that I'm

818
00:47:42.739 --> 00:47:44.478
, you know, that the morality requires me to

819
00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:49.148
treat them, not because it's good for you.

820
00:47:49.159 --> 00:47:51.119
That's, that's, that's the answer. Ok?

821
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:53.349
But it's not the case in uh uh in modern

822
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.329
morality, in modern morality, you know, morality

823
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.219
requires me to do things that are going to go

824
00:47:59.228 --> 00:48:01.429
against, against my interests that are going to be

825
00:48:01.438 --> 00:48:05.530
bad for me. And Nietzsche finds the origin of

826
00:48:05.539 --> 00:48:07.599
this in, in Christian morality. Ok. Now

827
00:48:08.168 --> 00:48:10.958
, so there's a, a kind of a building

828
00:48:10.969 --> 00:48:15.708
asceticism in the modern moral outlook that grew out of

829
00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:19.110
Christian morality. Now, of course, in the

830
00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:22.570
modern moral outlook that, that uh asceticism is fairly

831
00:48:22.579 --> 00:48:23.909
attenuated. I mean, the modern morality doesn't say

832
00:48:23.918 --> 00:48:25.579
, look, you should, you should give up

833
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.820
on your happiness, you should go against what's good

834
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:30.978
for you. You should go against your well being

835
00:48:30.289 --> 00:48:32.469
, uh uh if you want in order to be

836
00:48:32.478 --> 00:48:34.938
more, no, it says that no, you

837
00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:37.099
can, you can pursue your well being, you

838
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.840
can pursue your happiness, but only within the limits

839
00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:43.250
that are placed upon it, upon that pursuit by

840
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.449
morality. So there's going, there might be occasions

841
00:48:45.458 --> 00:48:47.918
in your life where you have to choose between what's

842
00:48:47.929 --> 00:48:51.260
good for you and what's morally. Right? Ok

843
00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:52.099
. So that can happen. That's the way,

844
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.019
that's the extent of the asceticism. Uh, in

845
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.958
modern morality. Ok. There might be circum,

846
00:48:57.969 --> 00:48:59.869
I mean, of course, in extreme circumstances,

847
00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:00.949
it may mean your death. I mean, sometimes

848
00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:05.349
morality requires you to sacrifice yourself, not, not

849
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.300
just your being, but your life for a moral

850
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:09.648
cause of some kind. All right. Now,

851
00:49:09.679 --> 00:49:14.208
there are many examples like this. But in Christian

852
00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:16.478
morality, the asceticism is not so attenuated. Ok

853
00:49:16.489 --> 00:49:19.829
? In Christian morality, you're being told that what

854
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.320
it is to be more, what it is to

855
00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:27.050
be good is just is to turn your back on

856
00:49:27.429 --> 00:49:30.579
your prosperity, your well being, your flourishing,

857
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.219
at least as a member of the natural world.

858
00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:35.978
OK. So what it is for me to be

859
00:49:35.989 --> 00:49:37.769
moral in the terms of Christian morality as Nietzsche understands

860
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.708
it is to turn my back on the, on

861
00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:44.059
the natural world completely and on myself as a member

862
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.168
of the natural world. So I have to give

863
00:49:45.179 --> 00:49:50.300
up uh uh on what he calls in the genealogy

864
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:53.199
uh physiological, which is another way in uh in

865
00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:57.889
German to say natural well being. Uh So my

866
00:49:57.898 --> 00:50:04.320
well being is an embodied uh individual with the kinds

867
00:50:04.329 --> 00:50:07.500
of uh needs, including psychological and emotional needs that

868
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.320
are characteristic of an embodied being. I have to

869
00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:13.719
turn my back on all of this. Uh That's

870
00:50:13.728 --> 00:50:15.849
what asceticism is? That's the kind of asceticism that

871
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:21.750
Nietzsche targets in the toy of the genealogy. So

872
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.750
, getting into the final topic of our conversation today

873
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.610
, what is then the will to nothingness and where

874
00:50:29.619 --> 00:50:36.199
does it stem from? Well, so we will

875
00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:39.739
do nothing less. Uh, is a, is

876
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:45.378
a phrase that Nietzsche introduces in the final essay of

877
00:50:45.389 --> 00:50:49.559
the genealogy. He mentions it in the first section

878
00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.898
of the essay and then in the final concluding section

879
00:50:51.909 --> 00:50:53.829
of the essay where, and he says in both

880
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.280
cases that uh uh it's better to will, nothing

881
00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.829
less than not to will at all. And so

882
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.659
clearly, what he has in mind is the role

883
00:51:05.668 --> 00:51:12.378
that uh the endorsement of Christian morality can play in

884
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:17.610
uh warning off against nihilism where Nihilism is the condition

885
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:23.429
of not willing, where uh the what motivates not

886
00:51:23.438 --> 00:51:27.458
willing is uh is the fact that it seems pointless

887
00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:30.769
to you to will anything you go. And it

888
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.039
can be pointless either because you can identify nothing worth

889
00:51:35.289 --> 00:51:38.829
willing or even if you can identify something worth willing

890
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.728
. As I argued in my first book, if

891
00:51:40.739 --> 00:51:44.090
you don't have what it takes to achieve what's worth

892
00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:45.188
willing, then what's the point of willing it anyway

893
00:51:45.199 --> 00:51:46.688
, if you can, if you can get there

894
00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:50.929
. And so he, he, he thinks that

895
00:51:50.938 --> 00:51:54.219
uh Christian morality, you know, is one of

896
00:51:54.228 --> 00:51:58.128
the functions of Christian morality is to stave off that

897
00:51:58.139 --> 00:52:01.349
kind of uh nihilistic. What he calls suicidal nihilism

898
00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:04.378
. So, to that extent, Christian morality is

899
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:08.728
an instrument of self preservation. But Christian morality does

900
00:52:08.739 --> 00:52:12.119
that in a way that's going to prove to be

901
00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:15.179
very costly. So it's trying to stave off nihilism

902
00:52:15.188 --> 00:52:17.070
. But in a way that eventually, you know

903
00:52:17.079 --> 00:52:20.789
, uh uh fails is self defeating in that way

904
00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:22.228
. And that's why I think he calls it a

905
00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:24.878
will to nothingness. So I, I don't think

906
00:52:24.889 --> 00:52:27.668
that what he means is that, you know,

907
00:52:27.679 --> 00:52:30.829
the Christians want nothing less as, as such,

908
00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:32.739
but what they want the way in which they go

909
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.360
about willing ends up being a will to nothing that

910
00:52:37.369 --> 00:52:38.340
because it's a way of willing, it's a way

911
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:44.590
of engaging in your life that turns out to uh

912
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:46.320
that, that gives set yourself a kind of an

913
00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:50.030
objective that uh but does so in a way that

914
00:52:50.039 --> 00:52:52.269
proves to be self defeating in the, in the

915
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.469
end of the day, that's why it ends in

916
00:52:53.478 --> 00:52:55.929
nothing that anyway, you try to, to keep

917
00:52:55.938 --> 00:53:00.309
nothing that away, but in a way that makes

918
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.458
it unavoidable for you. So is this will to

919
00:53:04.469 --> 00:53:09.050
nothingness, a moral outlook itself or not? Well

920
00:53:09.059 --> 00:53:12.918
, it's, it's uh so to say that uh

921
00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:16.500
Christian, the Christian moral outlook uh is expresses a

922
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:22.659
will to nothingness is basically the central critical claim that

923
00:53:22.668 --> 00:53:23.820
Nietzsche makes, right? So the, the Christian

924
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:28.050
moral outlook as a certain function, but the way

925
00:53:28.059 --> 00:53:31.340
in which it fulfills that function proves to be self

926
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.668
defeating or self undermining. Uh So the function is

927
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.708
broadly speaking, uh to restore their feeling of power

928
00:53:40.719 --> 00:53:45.889
to people whose, in, in whom the whose

929
00:53:45.898 --> 00:53:50.668
weakness has exposed them to it. But it does

930
00:53:50.679 --> 00:53:54.619
. So in a way that uh by depleting our

931
00:53:54.878 --> 00:54:00.820
, the strength of that individual makes them in the

932
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:07.309
long run, are unable to uh to maintain that

933
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.059
feeling of power, makes them unable to do the

934
00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:13.309
kinds of things that would make it the case,

935
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.119
that their presence in the world makes a difference in

936
00:54:15.128 --> 00:54:17.840
it. Uh Which is why I argue that uh

937
00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:22.039
you know, especially this is especially true of the

938
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.789
asceticism that Nietzsche advocates that this asceticism turns out to

939
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.610
be a pyrrhic victory. Because uh you know,

940
00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:30.128
if you uh uh if, if you believe that

941
00:54:30.139 --> 00:54:36.590
you can achieve natural well being, then repudiating national

942
00:54:36.599 --> 00:54:38.369
well uh natural well being is claiming that it has

943
00:54:38.378 --> 00:54:43.780
no value makes you uh has the benefit that you

944
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:46.179
don't have to feel like you are impotent or incompetent

945
00:54:46.188 --> 00:54:49.168
for your failure to achieve that kind of well being

946
00:54:50.969 --> 00:54:52.000
. But then the problem is that if you want

947
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.449
to subscribe, continue subscribing to the acidic ideal,

948
00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:58.398
you have to deprive yourself in ways that are going

949
00:54:58.409 --> 00:55:00.929
to weaken you even further. Which is why Nietzsche

950
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:04.199
says that the Christian morality, Christian asceticism in particular

951
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:07.099
addresses a sickness, the sickness that's caused by the

952
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.909
weakness that makes it very difficult for you to uh

953
00:55:09.918 --> 00:55:13.360
to make it the case that your presence in the

954
00:55:13.369 --> 00:55:15.099
world makes a difference in it. It addresses that

955
00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.489
weakness, it addresses only the symptoms of the weakness

956
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.010
, not the cold, the cause being the weakness

957
00:55:21.139 --> 00:55:22.478
. And in fact, what it does is that

958
00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:23.869
it, it further it, it, it,

959
00:55:23.889 --> 00:55:29.699
it exacerbates the weakness instead of eliminating it, ensuring

960
00:55:29.708 --> 00:55:31.188
that in the long run, you will find yourself

961
00:55:31.199 --> 00:55:34.809
completely incapable of making it the case that your presence

962
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.530
in the world makes a difference. So, so

963
00:55:37.539 --> 00:55:39.869
I used the uh so I used two analogies that

964
00:55:39.878 --> 00:55:43.849
might be helpful here. One is uh uh the

965
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.070
analogy of a Pyrrhic victory. So ps was this

966
00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:50.668
famous uh general who won uh victories, but at

967
00:55:50.679 --> 00:55:52.530
great cost to his army. So it was a

968
00:55:52.539 --> 00:55:53.958
victory, all right, he defeated the opposite army

969
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:55.989
, but he came out of that defeat, having

970
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.610
no army himself. So, so that if he

971
00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:00.579
were to face another threat again, he would be

972
00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:04.668
unable to meet it. Uh So if for a

973
00:56:04.679 --> 00:56:07.769
moment manages to do what he needs to do,

974
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.688
to establish security, to establish his power. But

975
00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.119
at the cost of being able to do it,

976
00:56:12.128 --> 00:56:13.619
you know, uh in the long run. So

977
00:56:13.628 --> 00:56:16.360
that's why it's a process that's ultimately self undermining the

978
00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:20.728
other analogy that I use, uh which is quite

979
00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:23.389
a, a uh applicable actually is an analogy with

980
00:56:23.398 --> 00:56:27.639
a uh a particular way of understanding the phenomenon of

981
00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.228
anorexia uh by uh at least in, in certain

982
00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:35.958
strains of psychoanalytic theory. So the anorexic gives up

983
00:56:35.969 --> 00:56:38.159
on the desire for food. They claim that feeding

984
00:56:38.168 --> 00:56:40.849
myself is not important. And it turns out that

985
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.780
the motivation very often it has to do with power

986
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:47.250
and independence. You know. So there are going

987
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.418
to be cases where the anorexic refuses to eat because

988
00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:57.679
for example, there caregivers use the, the act

989
00:56:57.688 --> 00:57:00.280
of feeding them as an opportunity for them, The

990
00:57:00.289 --> 00:57:05.050
caregivers to demonstrate to the, to the anorexic him

991
00:57:05.059 --> 00:57:07.219
or herself uh that they have power over them that

992
00:57:07.228 --> 00:57:09.719
they are that the anorexic is dependent on them and

993
00:57:09.728 --> 00:57:13.059
so on and so forth. So that uh the

994
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:15.159
anorexic might decide that well, if I want to

995
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:17.619
, to assert my power and my independence, I

996
00:57:17.628 --> 00:57:23.300
have to give up on the desires that make me

997
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:27.329
dependent, that make me more or less. And

998
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.260
so you can see how in some sense they do

999
00:57:30.269 --> 00:57:34.429
by uh disa avoiding those desires or by devaluing those

1000
00:57:34.438 --> 00:57:37.418
desires, they do achieve a measure of power and

1001
00:57:37.429 --> 00:57:39.628
independence, but you can also see what the cost

1002
00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:45.938
is for it. Great. So uh the book

1003
00:57:45.949 --> 00:57:49.409
is again, the Will To Nothingness, an essay

1004
00:57:49.418 --> 00:57:52.199
on niches on the genealogy of morality. I'm leaving

1005
00:57:52.208 --> 00:57:54.500
a link to it in the description box of this

1006
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:59.228
interview. And Doctor Regin, would you like to

1007
00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:01.429
tell people where they can find you and your work

1008
00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:05.360
on the internet? Well, I mean, the

1009
00:58:05.369 --> 00:58:07.679
best place to to go uh such as it is

1010
00:58:07.688 --> 00:58:12.438
, is probably the website uh of uh the philosophy

1011
00:58:12.449 --> 00:58:16.438
department at Broad University where I have a research page

1012
00:58:16.809 --> 00:58:21.219
uh which is always in need of, of updating

1013
00:58:21.228 --> 00:58:22.329
and improvement. But I hope to be able to

1014
00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:24.760
do this sometimes over the course of the summer.

1015
00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:29.829
Ok, great. So thank you so much again
