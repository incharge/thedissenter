00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.629
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.829
And today I'm joined by Doctor James mccann. He's

4
00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.409
Professor Emeritus of History at Boston University. His research

5
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.638
and teaching interests include agricultural and ecological history of Africa

6
00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:22.500
, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa field research

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.350
methods in African studies, the Agroecology of tropical disease

8
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.829
and the history of food slash cuisine in Africa and

9
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.668
the Atlantic world. And today we are going to

10
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.868
focus mostly on his book, Maize and Grace,

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.779
a History of Africa's Encounter with the new world crop

12
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.399
. So, Doctor mccann, welcome to the show

13
00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:47.429
. It's a huge pleasure to everyone. Thank you

14
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:51.899
for your invitation. So, uh let's start,

15
00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:55.548
I guess at the beginning. So uh we're going

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.798
to talk about maize here today. Where did maize

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.689
originate from? Maize is a new world crop that

18
00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:11.010
was um domesticated by peoples in Mesoamerica. And it's

19
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:15.799
difficult, we don't know the exact the first example

20
00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:19.189
of something we would call maize in the common term

21
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.000
. But there are examples of, of um archaeological

22
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.000
evidence of forgive the bat cave where they found something

23
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.769
that looks a bit like maize that has is on

24
00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:30.469
a, on the ear with a, with a

25
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.319
cob. Um And the evolution is the experimentation by

26
00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.510
local farmers. We don't know men and women both

27
00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:44.028
were involved probably. But we don't really know that

28
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.698
in Mesoamerica, but the characteristics that were evolved over

29
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.379
time was farmer selection of certain characteristics they wanted to

30
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.290
have available in their own diets and their own food

31
00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.808
. And maize is remarkable and it's spread internationally.

32
00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.129
That's why my interest in the arrival of maize and

33
00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:07.778
its propagation in Africa. It it's about farmer household

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.929
, local knowledge only to some degree about elite a

35
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.250
applications. So it's the earliest history we don't really

36
00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:21.689
know for sure. The spread me America into North

37
00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.939
America and as far as New England. And for

38
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:25.960
example, this is an exa example of a New

39
00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.800
England flint and eight rows and it's not something commercially

40
00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:36.159
viable, but it represents the kind of movement of

41
00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:38.500
, of, of Mays into new environments. This

42
00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:43.788
other example here you see this looks like what Columbus

43
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.118
would have brought with him. He brought Mays back

44
00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.569
from the Caribbean, a Caribbean red flint, which

45
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.849
is this one to Europe and he sent it to

46
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.110
his friends in different places in Germany and Italy and

47
00:02:57.118 --> 00:03:00.020
Spain. And it began to be experimented with and

48
00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:02.409
eventually was taken over by farmers themselves who were the

49
00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:07.429
key innovators both in Africa and in Europe. When

50
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.250
May spread as this popular crop that had certain characteristics

51
00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:15.469
that were overwhelmingly popular with farmers as they sought to

52
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.719
both be commercial but also to feed their local populations

53
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.669
. And what are some of those characteristics? What

54
00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.819
are the most distinct traits of mace maize is one

55
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.469
, it is wind pollinated in another. It's not

56
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:36.038
pollinated by insects or by um by other means.

57
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.118
And on the maize plant, you have both male

58
00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.909
and female parts of the plant plant. So it

59
00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.429
can self pollinate. But for the most part,

60
00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.050
the wind moves the pollen between fields and between plants

61
00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:51.969
. So you get automatically a mix, genetic mixing

62
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.618
that gives you a final result of texture color and

63
00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.719
the characters characteristics of the plant itself. So it

64
00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.679
has this characteristic that farmers have, have, have

65
00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.169
the ability to control it by by hand moving the

66
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.409
column. Um so that they have characteristics that they

67
00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.469
favor whether it's color or texture or for example,

68
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.629
how long it stores? Uh some varieties of maize

69
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.689
do not store very long at all, you have

70
00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.689
to consume them or they go bad, other ones

71
00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.290
will last longer. So farmers are making these choices

72
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:28.449
over generations. What the end result is? You

73
00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:31.980
find the difference between these two. I would say

74
00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:36.088
it's all about the farmer choices. Another lead scientist

75
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.139
, the farmer choices at the early level and the

76
00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:42.899
popularity of it as it spread around the world was

77
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.730
because it was controllable along with other new world.

78
00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:51.119
Um additions like capsicum pepper. We can't recognize world

79
00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:57.428
cuisines without recognizing the contribution of pepper capsicum. Uh

80
00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.629
In Indian, Indian Ethiopia, all varieties of taste

81
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.119
that we value coming from those new world exchanges with

82
00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.069
new world. Yeah. And uh what are some

83
00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:16.209
of the ways maize differs from other uh common crops

84
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.350
? Well, as I said, the wind pollination

85
00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:24.170
factor is something that farmers have to learn to control

86
00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.600
all the way to Monsanto. Suing farmers for the

87
00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:30.470
pollen being carried by the wind across fields in Iowa

88
00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.798
um or or elsewhere where the control of the pollen

89
00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.879
is the key issue about how do you make it

90
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.519
commercially viable. Um But the the difference when something

91
00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:43.910
like wheat, wheat is wheat is self pollinating,

92
00:05:44.988 --> 00:05:46.100
it doesn't, the pollen does not move more than

93
00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:49.139
a few microns from different parts of the plant.

94
00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:53.850
Rice is is self pollinating. Uh So maize dis

95
00:05:53.858 --> 00:05:56.959
distinctive and it is wind pollinated, not insect pollinated

96
00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.980
and that makes a huge difference. But farmers understood

97
00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:03.040
this pretty quickly when any place where we see where

98
00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:06.488
maize has become adapted as a ma a major crop

99
00:06:06.738 --> 00:06:10.149
, you see that farmers are adjusting their own knowledge

100
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.559
systems to the characteristics of maize. Maize is hermaphrodite

101
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.319
. It represents both genders on the same club,

102
00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:26.790
but it also is uh I guess morally and and

103
00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:32.399
unquestionably about sharing sexual engagements, right? And so

104
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.798
, I mean, we're also going to talk about

105
00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.639
how maize spread across the globe and specifically uh in

106
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:45.199
Africa. Uh but what are, are there specific

107
00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:50.220
ecological conditions where maize produces high higher yields, where

108
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.899
it grows, it grows and is farmed the best

109
00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.798
? Well, of course, that's a key characteristic

110
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.488
. And when maize came from, you know,

111
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.480
directly, for example, from, from the Atlantic

112
00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:08.759
trade with Brazil and the trade, the Atlantic trade

113
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.069
of course has is a complex interaction of sugar and

114
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:15.559
human labor, forced labor, you know, slaves

115
00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:20.079
um going across and carrying maize as a potential crop

116
00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:25.220
brought into the African case into West Africa, later

117
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.079
into Southern Africa. But also up the Nile and

118
00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:32.449
into the Indian Ocean world where the word the the

119
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:38.639
Kiswahili word for maize is Muindi. It's from India

120
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.238
. It doesn't come, didn't come from India.

121
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.730
But the the understanding, the popular understanding of where

122
00:07:44.738 --> 00:07:47.069
this thing came from became the name. If we

123
00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:49.309
look at the name for maize in different cultures,

124
00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.949
different languages. We learned a lot about people's perceptions

125
00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:59.178
of that crop. Um In, in Malawi,

126
00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:01.480
for example, the word the word for, for

127
00:08:01.488 --> 00:08:05.338
maize, it means um from our ancestors, even

128
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.220
though it came fairly late into place like Malawi,

129
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.579
we replaced sorghum. Sorghum is not as productive as

130
00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:16.738
maize and, and farmers at each location, whether

131
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.778
it's tropical, subtropical um or somewhat um affected by

132
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.399
the amount of moisture available by rainfall by, by

133
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.619
climate farmers adjusted to that. So you see the

134
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:33.729
varieties of maize in all over the world ad adapted

135
00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.950
and again, not so much like recent times by

136
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.288
corporations who are, who are attempting to make maize

137
00:08:41.298 --> 00:08:45.288
science. And that's the sort of dominant the farmers

138
00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:48.460
made this choice every year when they selected their seeds

139
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.690
, they would, they would choose some of the

140
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.690
, some of the Mazier for seed and some for

141
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.678
consumption. And the seed represented their sense of what

142
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.529
they identified is the characteristics they wanted. And that

143
00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:05.259
includes the maize plant as forage, for animals.

144
00:09:05.729 --> 00:09:09.570
So for example, in Italy, the the the

145
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.340
the the fact that the farm that the peasant farmers

146
00:09:11.349 --> 00:09:15.599
were able to use the maize plant, not just

147
00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:16.908
the the the ear, but the plant itself to

148
00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:20.558
feed their cattle meant that they could keep the cattle

149
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.219
in the barns on their farm and not send them

150
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:24.690
into the mountains in the winter. And what they

151
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.719
get from that is distinctive kinds of products of the

152
00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:35.038
animals were eating the maize such as Parmesan, such

153
00:09:35.048 --> 00:09:37.950
as Gorgonzola, the cheeses, Italians, Italy is

154
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.580
so well known for is part of the product of

155
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.639
maize is at the core feeding of the animals.

156
00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.019
So they can be kept in the barns and fed

157
00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.450
over the course of the winter. And thus ST

158
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:50.658
storing the the milk in the form of cheese.

159
00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:58.239
So it's not that uh maize uh only uh I

160
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.840
mean grows well or produces a good yield, good

161
00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:07.129
yields in specific climates. I mean different kinds of

162
00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:13.899
maize have been adapted to different sorts of uh climates

163
00:10:13.908 --> 00:10:16.969
and environments. Yeah. With the restrictions on maize

164
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:20.250
, within the constraints that farmers would respect would would

165
00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:26.500
um develop is maize is is vulnerable to drought moisture

166
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.899
sensitive. So if you, if you have a

167
00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:33.500
drought prone area, either seasonally or within a year

168
00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.798
, you have to realize that maize is vulnerable to

169
00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:41.830
, to moisture, to moisture uh availability. The

170
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.479
other way, maize tends does not store as long

171
00:10:43.489 --> 00:10:46.908
as other crops, millets store for a very long

172
00:10:46.918 --> 00:10:52.469
time. Ethiopian crop tiff will, will store for

173
00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:56.950
years. Maze, you get four months, maybe

174
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.408
maximum six months but unlikely. So you've got to

175
00:10:58.418 --> 00:11:01.759
eat it, move it, preserve it somehow.

176
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.979
So it has those constraints on maze. And so

177
00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:05.820
that's why you don't see maze as a domino c

178
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.259
everywhere. OK. Uh And when it comes,

179
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.840
uh we've, you've already mentioned some of that but

180
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:18.038
when it comes how and why it spread across the

181
00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:24.279
globe apart from the trades you've already mentioned, were

182
00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:28.178
there any specific, for example, political or economic

183
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:35.408
reasons for it to become so widespread? Uh uh

184
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.090
Well, yes, one, it's, here's an

185
00:11:37.099 --> 00:11:39.210
example and this is not from the Africa work I

186
00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:41.750
did, but the work I've done in Italy where

187
00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:46.269
the key crop for the veto. Venice was an

188
00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.019
empire, an empire of trade. But they,

189
00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:52.798
the, the, the Venetian patricians, the rich

190
00:11:52.808 --> 00:11:54.788
folks in Venice itself told the farmers on the terra

191
00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:58.149
firma of who they controlled that. You will pay

192
00:11:58.158 --> 00:12:01.450
your taxes and wheat. And the farmer said wheat

193
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.538
doesn't work well here in northern northern Italy, wheat

194
00:12:05.548 --> 00:12:07.340
works in southern Italy and elsewhere. So we want

195
00:12:07.349 --> 00:12:11.418
to start paying our taxes in maize. And at

196
00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:13.288
first, the patricians in Venice said, no,

197
00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:16.048
we want wheat and we control you. So the

198
00:12:16.058 --> 00:12:20.149
battle eventually was won by the peasants in the terra

199
00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:22.509
firma. And because of the, the, the

200
00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:26.558
the plague and other kinds of situations, they won

201
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.879
the day and were allowed to pay their taxes in

202
00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:31.070
maize. And of course, maize then becomes the

203
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.869
basis for the diet in northern Italy of polenta rather

204
00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:39.168
than pasta is an importation from Southern Italy. And

205
00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:43.029
the same thing happens where maize is introduced in uh

206
00:12:43.038 --> 00:12:48.250
in Africa where fa farmers find it help help important

207
00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:52.340
to adapt maize as their fundamental crop. But one

208
00:12:52.349 --> 00:12:56.308
of the liabilities of maize is it has insufficient amino

209
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.759
acids. So you have the pro from palabra is

210
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:07.690
disease that you find especially in agricultural societies in Southern

211
00:13:07.168 --> 00:13:11.759
the American South, in Italy and any and in

212
00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:13.009
southern Africa, any place you have a dominance of

213
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:16.580
maize in the diet that came as part of,

214
00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:20.200
of maize being a really popular crop for farmers to

215
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.609
grow is Pella is a skin disease and you find

216
00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:26.678
it places where the diet becomes too dependent on maize

217
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.168
. But you don't find that in Mid America because

218
00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:37.570
in Mesoamerica, they process maize using lies and change

219
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.048
the chemistry so that you get a complete uh amino

220
00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:41.879
acid and complete protein by having a maize based diet

221
00:13:43.859 --> 00:13:45.599
. It has to do with processing. How do

222
00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:48.479
you process the maze? But they didn't do that

223
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:52.769
in um in other places, Italy, Africa,

224
00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:56.599
the southern us where Pella becomes a serious problem until

225
00:13:56.609 --> 00:14:00.219
it's understood that you have to complete the proteins by

226
00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:03.979
, by research in the early 20th century. And

227
00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:09.969
when exactly did maize get to Africa? Well,

228
00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:11.239
we don't, of course, completely know, but

229
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:16.038
we can look at um places early on, we

230
00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:18.509
begin to get adaptation. For example, a na

231
00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:22.418
uh the names given to maize you find in places

232
00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:26.590
in Nigeria or West Africa that the the words for

233
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:31.418
maize tell us something. The the um the Akan

234
00:14:31.428 --> 00:14:35.629
in Ghana, uh the word for, for,

235
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.859
for maize means something from the foreigners in Ethiopia.

236
00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:43.460
Then one of the words for a maze was Yar

237
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.129
Maila. In other words, the sor go from

238
00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:50.869
across the ocean, it looks maize looks like.

239
00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:52.219
So, so sorghum or Sorghum looks like maize when

240
00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:56.649
it's growing early on. But that the factor of

241
00:14:56.658 --> 00:15:00.599
people recognizing saying it's the so them from across the

242
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:03.048
sea. And now when you go to to the

243
00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:05.359
place of within Ethiopia, I work, it's just

244
00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:09.529
called Mahila, which just means Sorghum, it's not

245
00:15:09.538 --> 00:15:11.788
Sorghum. But people understand that the word tells you

246
00:15:13.048 --> 00:15:16.788
people's perceptions of when this arrived. Uh So exact

247
00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:20.700
dates by the time the Portuguese arrive in Ethiopia,

248
00:15:20.109 --> 00:15:22.658
they're finding some maize there and they tell us what

249
00:15:22.668 --> 00:15:26.899
they're growing. And you can see the maize has

250
00:15:26.908 --> 00:15:28.940
already arrived. But we don't have a clear historical

251
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.090
record because that's something takes place in the basic level

252
00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.009
of human subsistence and doesn't make it into the historical

253
00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:37.500
sources quite as clearly as it does later on.

254
00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:45.239
And how does maize tie to Africa's Green Revolution?

255
00:15:46.469 --> 00:15:50.058
Well, the Green Revolution originally was done with rice

256
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.190
for South Asia. So, so for India,

257
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.190
South Asia and so that revolution was about doing short

258
00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:00.000
, short that you have to have, you have

259
00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:03.519
to have water and you have to have fertilizer and

260
00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:07.070
you get a huge growth in food production in South

261
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.570
Asia for Africa. The the the attempt has been

262
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.639
to say yes, maize is going to be for

263
00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:18.798
Africa like rice was for South Asia and that's done

264
00:16:18.808 --> 00:16:22.798
by has been done by corporations by USA ID International

265
00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:26.428
Organizations. Um The key center for research on maize

266
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.168
is in Mexico City when I visited there. Uh

267
00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:34.200
I was taken to uh there was Ethiopian there who

268
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.489
I got, I work in Ethiopia. So we

269
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.639
became friends. He took me to a rural site

270
00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:44.840
outside of Mexico City. Uh and they were growing

271
00:16:44.849 --> 00:16:48.200
their maize seed for which was going to be introduced

272
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.979
to Ethiopia. Uh So the international nature of the

273
00:16:52.989 --> 00:16:56.139
research going on now the Green Revolution, the idea

274
00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.580
was maize can be the center point of that for

275
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.750
Africa, but with the problems that maze has about

276
00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:06.868
stability and about incomplete proteins. And so what he

277
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.660
this Ethiopian scientist was doing, I'm developing a new

278
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:18.229
variety with complete um proteins. So it would have

279
00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:21.189
to be identified having a market value, you pay

280
00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:23.699
more for those seeds to have complete proteins. And

281
00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:27.799
this this uh type of maize though was also introduced

282
00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:30.430
elsewhere in Africa is part of what people hoped would

283
00:17:30.439 --> 00:17:33.229
be a green rev kind of green revolution. And

284
00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:37.670
it has done that the improvement in the the yield

285
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.150
of the maize, you improve maize is substantial to

286
00:17:41.588 --> 00:17:45.959
um 68 tons per hectare compared to two tons per

287
00:17:45.969 --> 00:17:51.400
hectare in local varieties. So that is Africa was

288
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.358
has been seen as the key to that in many

289
00:17:53.368 --> 00:17:59.160
ways. It is although for example, Ethiopian restaurants

290
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.189
are very popular in around the world but in in

291
00:18:02.199 --> 00:18:04.489
the US and in in Europe and you will not

292
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.549
find maize even though it's the number one crop in

293
00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:10.578
Ethiopia, you will not find maize on the diet

294
00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:12.789
of Ethiopia, the menu of Ethiopian restaurants because it's

295
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:18.229
not traditionally their ideal food, the food of poverty

296
00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:21.239
. Um you can buy ears of maize on the

297
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.390
street, roasted maize on the street, very inexpensive

298
00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:26.469
. But as a as a fund fundamental part of

299
00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:33.880
diet problematic. And why is it that uh when

300
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.729
it comes to Africa, people decided on maize?

301
00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:41.568
I mean, why wasn't it some other crop.

302
00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.910
Well, they have, you can, you can

303
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.400
look at each individual situation. The place I work

304
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.170
in Ethiopia, they had a full maize came very

305
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.309
late. It was there as a garden crop,

306
00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.469
early yielding. It's the first crop of the year

307
00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:59.539
. You have it in your, your household garden

308
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.949
. Um, you get the first milky stage,

309
00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.848
you can eat milky stage maize or wait, wait

310
00:19:04.858 --> 00:19:07.469
till it dries and then process it. But it's

311
00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:11.709
the first crop you're going to get. Um But

312
00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:14.130
there, there they had other crops, they had

313
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.559
death in wheat and barley. And it was a

314
00:19:15.568 --> 00:19:19.328
very, very diversified cropping system. The farmers understood

315
00:19:19.338 --> 00:19:22.920
well in other places, places in Southern Africa,

316
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.108
for example, it arrived, it replaced Sorghum because

317
00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:29.949
it was much more productive. And the African farmers

318
00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:32.699
all over Southern Africa said this thing will give us

319
00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:34.689
a yield quickly and it is a food that we

320
00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:38.180
can adapt into our diet. So sorghum has almost

321
00:19:38.189 --> 00:19:41.809
disappeared. And maize is the crop that has many

322
00:19:41.818 --> 00:19:45.719
different varieties in all the countries of Southern Africa.

323
00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:48.650
All different names. Basically, it's what Americans would

324
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.209
call, call grits or Italians would call polenta.

325
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:56.489
Uh So maze in its various forms, ref reflects

326
00:19:56.549 --> 00:20:00.140
the the choice of farmers to say this thing gives

327
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.400
an early yield. But the new varieties, the

328
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.930
green revolution varieties yield much later and you don't eat

329
00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:10.309
them at the m milky stage. At the green

330
00:20:10.318 --> 00:20:11.608
stage. You have, you have to wait and

331
00:20:11.618 --> 00:20:15.309
dry them and then process them. So it feeds

332
00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:19.239
into the industrialization of of mills that began to change

333
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.750
the way that the market affected. What kind of

334
00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:26.348
maize farmers were growing. And the government would say

335
00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:29.009
, ok, you may, may grow only this

336
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.750
kind of maize because we cannot sell colored maize.

337
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.969
B maize drops out of the market because the international

338
00:20:34.979 --> 00:20:40.410
market say we want white maize. And if yellow

339
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.719
maize is grown, yellow maize is useful for poultry

340
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:48.549
who likes white yolks and their eggs, the yellow

341
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.598
comes from the beta carotene in the yellow maize.

342
00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:56.539
Hm So you have these adaptations where the Millers are

343
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:57.390
saying we want this kind of maize because that's the

344
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.430
one we can sell into international markets. And so

345
00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:03.709
you have it for Africa. Virtually all of the

346
00:21:03.719 --> 00:21:07.519
African maize is white in the US, maize is

347
00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:11.150
for livestock and you want your, your the fat

348
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.039
of your livestock to be kind of a little bit

349
00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:17.828
yellow. So the the yellow maize is dominant in

350
00:21:17.838 --> 00:21:21.259
North America and in Europe too, white maize is

351
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:22.680
still there. You can buy polenta, either white

352
00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:26.358
or red, depending on your taste. What you're

353
00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:29.239
eating the polenta with, with, with fish or

354
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.039
with uh with, with the tomato sauce, et

355
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:36.439
cetera. So these are consumer preferences that reflect the

356
00:21:36.449 --> 00:21:38.910
larger market preferences of the kind of maize that farmers

357
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.239
are going to be growing to produce commercially for the

358
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:49.608
market. So uh politics and economics also certainly play

359
00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:53.640
a big role in the adoption and spread of maize

360
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.088
across Africa. Right? Yes. So if you

361
00:21:57.098 --> 00:22:00.809
look at a place like Zimbabwe, which did fantastic

362
00:22:00.818 --> 00:22:04.559
research on maize development, the law system eventually through

363
00:22:04.568 --> 00:22:07.130
the 20th century said, OK, you may not

364
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.049
grow maize which is not white. Uh because white

365
00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:15.959
is the international market and we're producing some of the

366
00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:19.939
best hybrid maize developed through research came out not out

367
00:22:19.949 --> 00:22:23.130
of the North America, out of Rhodesia, Southern

368
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.189
Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe. Because the the,

369
00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:30.400
the, the maize, the scientists there, the

370
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.939
white, the white Rhodesian scientists developed a incredibly productive

371
00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:37.989
uh variety. But for that variety of, of

372
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.309
really um productive maze in terms of, of the

373
00:22:44.318 --> 00:22:47.779
of the economic perspective that you had to have just

374
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:51.108
the right soils, just the right moisture, just

375
00:22:51.118 --> 00:22:53.170
the right seasonal conditions. And of course, the

376
00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.588
white population in Southern Rhodesia controlled those things. And

377
00:22:57.598 --> 00:23:02.459
the the black farmers were not given access to this

378
00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:07.209
new variety. These new varieties incredibly productive is from

379
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.699
a scientific point of view, economic point of view

380
00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:11.759
. But you also founded. This is a story

381
00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:14.250
I got when I was doing work, work in

382
00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:18.019
Zimbabwe, one of those scientists showed me a chart

383
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.910
he made, he said, chart showed, wait

384
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.229
a second. Why is suddenly this this production going

385
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:27.670
up? But we're not, we're not charting.

386
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.150
He said in his own handwriting, he wrote in

387
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.868
this little chart from the 19 sixties. He showed

388
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.949
me this chart when I interviewed him, he wrote

389
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:41.759
African farmers. In other words, African farmers had

390
00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:42.588
found the, the, the new crop, the

391
00:23:42.598 --> 00:23:47.269
new variety and were using it and adapting it in

392
00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:48.689
their own terms. Even though the government was trying

393
00:23:48.699 --> 00:23:52.699
to suppress their, their role in production of,

394
00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:55.818
of, of maize. Very, very, very

395
00:23:55.828 --> 00:23:59.680
political economic, in a fascinating way, which is

396
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:03.479
what led me into and what led me into you

397
00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:04.519
didn't ask this question, but I'll answer it anyway

398
00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.390
. How did I begin to understand and, and

399
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.049
want to explore more of the role of maize because

400
00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:14.029
I grew up with maize fields all around me as

401
00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:17.289
a kid. I grew up in Illinois and Illinois

402
00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:18.578
is a big maize producing area. But when I

403
00:24:18.588 --> 00:24:22.108
was interviewing farmers in Ethiopia after the famine, uh

404
00:24:22.118 --> 00:24:25.630
there was a socialist government in place that was trying

405
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.989
to control farmer activities and farmers were growing their different

406
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.439
varieties of crops. And then suddenly when I said

407
00:24:33.449 --> 00:24:33.559
, OK, what did you go last year,

408
00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:36.420
the year before that? It's a year before that

409
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.618
. They were saying, well, this is the

410
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.838
maize, maize, maize, maize. Really?

411
00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:44.799
I said maize is drought is drought um affected.

412
00:24:45.098 --> 00:24:48.608
Um it, it it is not the best nutrition

413
00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:49.769
in the world, it doesn't fit your normal diet

414
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.959
. Why are you doing this? And so I

415
00:24:52.969 --> 00:24:56.920
began to understand it's because the government is saying we

416
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.939
don't care what you grow as long as you pay

417
00:24:59.949 --> 00:25:03.039
in these other crops. And they said that maize

418
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:06.088
was safe because the government wouldn't take it from him

419
00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:08.900
. It was a political decision that, that affected

420
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.670
what farmers did, right? Uh And uh I

421
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.180
mean, uh going along the uh that line of

422
00:25:17.189 --> 00:25:18.539
what uh I would also like to ask you a

423
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:22.670
little bit about the particular case of South Africa,

424
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.660
which you have done some work on. Uh you

425
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.269
mentioned science there for example. And I asked you

426
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:32.209
about politics, but in the particular case of South

427
00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:36.549
Africa, uh in what ways did politics, science

428
00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:41.588
and race intermingle there? Well, for Southern Africa

429
00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:42.750
, we you know the politics, we know of

430
00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:48.150
the the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century and

431
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.250
then spread from the cape into colonial settings that were

432
00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:56.930
originally the the arrival of uh Dutch later on the

433
00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.979
the the British Empire incorporated that but the basic population

434
00:26:00.219 --> 00:26:06.390
still was agricultural. Um And they of course had

435
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.969
needs for the mines. So the Southern African economies

436
00:26:08.979 --> 00:26:12.328
were about gold first, sorry, diamonds first,

437
00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:15.689
then gold and that became the diamond. So what

438
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:18.250
do you need? You need labor? Mhm And

439
00:26:18.259 --> 00:26:22.930
when the labor is the black population which needs to

440
00:26:22.939 --> 00:26:26.588
be fed and the the mine owners were having to

441
00:26:26.598 --> 00:26:30.209
determine what do we feed our mine workers to keep

442
00:26:30.219 --> 00:26:36.979
them healthy enough to work and maize became the key

443
00:26:36.989 --> 00:26:41.759
crop for them. Uh And the the word Milly

444
00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:44.709
. Milly pop is a South African word for polenta

445
00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:47.509
or for the basic maize, which comes from the

446
00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:51.529
Portuguese Mili. So merely was not maize, but

447
00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:55.130
word came to include maize from the original Portuguese.

448
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.368
And so you have this phenomenon of the mind economy

449
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.509
, creating a sense of what is what is good

450
00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:07.939
food. Um And eventually the population came to define

451
00:27:07.949 --> 00:27:11.618
their full bellies is the feeling you get when you've

452
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.279
eaten a big batch of maize. And when that

453
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:18.699
becomes a kind of a cultural norm of what feeling

454
00:27:18.709 --> 00:27:25.259
full is um maize becomes that key ingredient. So

455
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:27.299
the the miners also went back to their family farms

456
00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:30.420
when they worked, headed out of the mines and

457
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.598
they began to grow maize as down the crop.

458
00:27:33.608 --> 00:27:36.680
And that was women doing the work back home where

459
00:27:36.689 --> 00:27:41.489
men were the miners earning wages. And therefore the

460
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.029
the core diet became maze because it was low labor

461
00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:47.588
, lower labor. Somebody I did mention maze takes

462
00:27:47.598 --> 00:27:51.348
less labor, you can broadcast it. Um You

463
00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:52.979
don't have to do it by role, et cetera

464
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:56.029
. Uh So its characteristics meant it could be adapted

465
00:27:56.039 --> 00:28:00.719
on small farms in which women's labor was the key

466
00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:03.368
issue. So Southern Africa, it was about mining

467
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:10.519
, the economy and eventually became the accepted um diet

468
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:15.420
was maize was the core of any meal. Yes

469
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.250
, there was sorghum a little bit here and there

470
00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:18.900
. You can still buy some Sorghum in South African

471
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.309
. Uh gro groceries. But for the most part

472
00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:26.630
, the basic diet is maize, white maze.

473
00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:32.009
Mhm. Right. And do we know if uh

474
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:37.539
maize has had uh any impact on the biodiversity of

475
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:41.618
Africa? Well, in some ways, it's a

476
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.719
negative effect because the farmer incentives with political context in

477
00:28:45.729 --> 00:28:49.818
many cases is maize is the crop that's really yielding

478
00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:53.108
. It gives a very good yield for small farmers

479
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.118
and you go to, you know, 6 to

480
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.338
8 tons per hectare of the new varieties. So

481
00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:02.660
farmers are seeking both the commercial value of that to

482
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.939
to send to the the cities but also it is

483
00:29:04.949 --> 00:29:08.858
very, very attractive is the local diet. Um

484
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:15.900
So the biodiversity pushing maize as as USA ID does

485
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.449
with the Agra, the the this big development program

486
00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:23.618
based upon maize is the primary crop. Uh So

487
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:30.088
you have corporations Mon Monsanto and of course May's production

488
00:29:30.348 --> 00:29:34.239
, Monsanto is now owned by by year. So

489
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.160
the big maize producers are all owned by drug companies

490
00:29:37.358 --> 00:29:41.039
by chemical companies. Dupont owned all of those,

491
00:29:41.049 --> 00:29:45.689
those early developers of of maize in North America in

492
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:49.380
Europe are all owned by now. Chemical drug companies

493
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.559
, Dupont Bayer um go down the line. So

494
00:29:53.568 --> 00:29:56.880
it it becomes a corporate crop and farmers are are

495
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.660
dealing with markets and their own food supply depending on

496
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.539
where you are in Africa. Maize is not the

497
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:06.979
dominant crop in every part of Africa. It is

498
00:30:06.989 --> 00:30:08.489
in, it is in southern Africa. It is

499
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:14.459
in Kenya, Tanzania. Ugali is essentially grits polenta

500
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:17.779
. But for, for East Africa and that's I

501
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:19.838
had a friend, a Ugandan friend who came to

502
00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:23.890
Ethiopia and she was dying to have ugali in her

503
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.588
diet because she's from Uganda and for her food,

504
00:30:26.598 --> 00:30:30.078
met maize. At that point, Ethiopian restaurant,

505
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:37.118
Ethiopian national diet did not really include maize for the

506
00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:40.500
middle and upper class. So, Mays has his

507
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:41.608
fun role, role. It's not a friend of

508
00:30:41.618 --> 00:30:49.500
biodiversity. Mhm And uh a related question, do

509
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:53.858
we know what impact uh the introduction of maize had

510
00:30:53.868 --> 00:30:59.890
on African people's nutrition and health. Well, I

511
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.729
mentioned pra too much dependent on maize but maize has

512
00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:07.479
its place because it yields early depending on the variety

513
00:31:07.489 --> 00:31:10.219
you're growing. You can be can be the first

514
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:14.380
thing that comes as the first crop you have.

515
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.019
We have often Af African cultures have celebrations of the

516
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:18.848
first crop. The the new year begins. The

517
00:31:18.858 --> 00:31:22.459
first thing you can get is maize because you can

518
00:31:22.469 --> 00:31:25.500
eat it the milky stage as we eat with with

519
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:26.979
uh we haven't mentioned there are five varieties of maize

520
00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:30.598
, one of which is sweet corn, uh which

521
00:31:30.608 --> 00:31:32.449
is the one you eat at the milky stage.

522
00:31:32.618 --> 00:31:36.229
It's wonderful, delicious. Um Something in the fall

523
00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:40.118
when the first maze comes in, you wanna have

524
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.469
um sweet corn. There's also popcorn, also dent

525
00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:45.318
corn, also flint corn. These are both flint

526
00:31:45.328 --> 00:31:52.608
corns which has the characters are scoring longer uh which

527
00:31:52.618 --> 00:31:55.868
is a good thing, but they may take longer

528
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.160
to mature and you're not, you're not consuming them

529
00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.848
at the early stage. So the the the role

530
00:32:00.858 --> 00:32:04.108
of maize in the diet differs on which kind of

531
00:32:04.118 --> 00:32:07.430
cuisines you're talking about which parts of Africa, Africa

532
00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:09.630
, of course, is a wonderfully diverse place,

533
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.209
linguistically, culturally, in terms of diet and maize

534
00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:17.259
plays an important part in a number of different African

535
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:23.420
diets. Mhm. So for the second part of

536
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.098
the interview, let's say, I would like to

537
00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:31.118
ask you a few more general questions not specifically related

538
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:36.189
to maize itself. So uh particularly when I asked

539
00:32:36.199 --> 00:32:39.279
you about Southern Africa and also earlier in the interview

540
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:42.219
, you mentioned a little bit of it, uh

541
00:32:42.229 --> 00:32:46.789
we talked about colonialism. So uh what would you

542
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:52.068
say was the role played by colonialism when it comes

543
00:32:52.078 --> 00:32:55.660
to spreading crops across the globe? And uh how

544
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.939
was the adoption of different crops influenced by it?

545
00:33:02.088 --> 00:33:05.229
Well, it depends on the situation. We have

546
00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:08.568
an example of Ethiopia where there was not formal colonialism

547
00:33:08.578 --> 00:33:12.439
. The Italian period was only a few years.

548
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:16.068
So the adaptation was done essentially by farmers themselves,

549
00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:19.890
taking advantage of what is available to them in terms

550
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.108
of their own strategies of cropping across a year and

551
00:33:22.118 --> 00:33:24.430
feeding their community with a little bit of commercials,

552
00:33:24.439 --> 00:33:28.719
selling of, of grains. But also the household

553
00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:30.170
level. When you go to a place like Southern

554
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.118
Africa or or so Southern Africa, you have a

555
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:40.189
large arrival of the European population who are originally Dutch

556
00:33:40.199 --> 00:33:44.309
and then English and then some Portuguese and different,

557
00:33:44.318 --> 00:33:49.479
different groups arrive there. Europeans who control things who

558
00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:52.838
are interested in feeding their labor and feeding themselves.

559
00:33:52.848 --> 00:33:57.608
So you have in South Africa. So a wonderful

560
00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:01.959
um tradition now of wine because some of the early

561
00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:07.578
migrants out of Europe were Huguenots. The huguenots were

562
00:34:07.588 --> 00:34:09.389
escaping France because they were oppressed by the Cat Catholic

563
00:34:09.398 --> 00:34:16.070
majority there. And they began importing uh vineyards and

564
00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:20.010
that became now today, some of the best places

565
00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:22.320
to go and on wine tours in the world.

566
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.918
In my experience, South Africa is fantastic. Um

567
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.559
And that links to the minefields needed labor. The

568
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.688
certain minefield, the vineyards needed labor and those laborers

569
00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:37.688
were eating increasingly maize getting back to maze but it

570
00:34:37.697 --> 00:34:44.208
was and some places there was not a European population

571
00:34:44.268 --> 00:34:46.389
in East Africa, Kenya a little bit Tanzania.

572
00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:50.878
You had European populations that were affecting what farmers were

573
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.849
doing because they're expected that farmers would grow crops consumed

574
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:59.289
by Europeans. Uh West Africa, the conditions of

575
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.590
malaria, something else I work on malaria meant that

576
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:06.010
Europeans and large populations did not populate West Africa,

577
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:08.449
they would tend to populate as in, in um

578
00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:14.840
in India hill stations that were fear from malaria.

579
00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:19.099
So Europeans would con control those spaces and so the

580
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:23.458
population was allowed to keep um local varieties of foodstuffs

581
00:35:23.469 --> 00:35:25.789
. So for example, in West Africa, you

582
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.378
had the possibility of, of uh maize could be

583
00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:32.409
there as a first crop if you're clearing your forest

584
00:35:32.918 --> 00:35:35.409
. But the, the crops you really want to

585
00:35:35.418 --> 00:35:37.929
have in there are yam cassava, another manio,

586
00:35:38.148 --> 00:35:42.360
another new world crop. Uh If you, you

587
00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:45.989
know bubble tea. Uh yes, the bubbles are

588
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.179
maniac. A casa. We were OK. Uh

589
00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:55.418
So you have these mixes sometimes called the Colombian exchange

590
00:35:55.429 --> 00:35:58.739
of crops coming from the old new world to the

591
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.579
old world. I call it the I call it

592
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:05.478
not the exchange, but the circulation because the food

593
00:36:05.489 --> 00:36:07.789
crops along with peoples are circulating and bringing their preferred

594
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.369
foods with them. So in West Africa, you

595
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:14.708
have forest crops, yams, they're, they're grown

596
00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:15.039
in the, in the, in the, in

597
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.840
the forest floor. Uh Maize is there for the

598
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:22.489
first crop but then people want to get into yams

599
00:36:22.978 --> 00:36:25.898
and, and cassava and other kinds of crops taken

600
00:36:25.909 --> 00:36:29.139
from the forest, the biodiversity of the forest.

601
00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:30.750
So all that's changing, of course as cities grow

602
00:36:32.269 --> 00:36:36.349
. But the colonial effect is greatest in some places

603
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.780
where there could be new neo Europe such as southern

604
00:36:37.789 --> 00:36:43.300
Africa, Kenya. But where there's factions of disease

605
00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:47.188
, the African population had resistance to uh the Europeans

606
00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:50.989
would tend to avoid those areas, control them for

607
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.570
pro production of food and for mining, et cetera

608
00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:57.889
. But uh maize there was, it's, it's

609
00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.199
it's interest came from farmers themselves. But also because

610
00:37:01.208 --> 00:37:05.929
Europeans were happy to have those workers under, under

611
00:37:05.938 --> 00:37:10.168
colonial rule fed and the maze then became a key

612
00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:15.820
part of that process of nutrition. Mhm. So

613
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:21.840
uh in historical scholarship, one approach that people have

614
00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:27.918
is to look at the causal relationship between climate and

615
00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:30.510
history. Uh What do you think of it?

616
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.429
Climate is fundamental to history, climate about seasonality.

617
00:37:36.438 --> 00:37:39.869
What is the annual cycle of, of availability of

618
00:37:39.878 --> 00:37:45.539
moisture? Uh Disease is also sea seasonal affected by

619
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.179
climate by issues of climate. It's the thing I'm

620
00:37:49.188 --> 00:37:51.648
working on now is sort of the more fundamental issue

621
00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:54.030
about water, water, its presence, its absence

622
00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:57.539
, its movement, it's movement through the seasons.

623
00:37:57.989 --> 00:38:02.648
And this is deeply within the issue of climate change

624
00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:07.070
, climate change, velvet of water. But of

625
00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:08.909
course, just look at today's stuff in, in

626
00:38:08.918 --> 00:38:12.289
Ukraine. But what do you do when you want

627
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.349
to defeat your enemy? This is what the Germans

628
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.010
did in Italy in World War Two. They said

629
00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:20.750
we're gonna stop the allied invasion in Italy by flooding

630
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.780
the farmers' fields because then that will encourage malaria which

631
00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:25.898
will affect the invading army. In this case,

632
00:38:25.909 --> 00:38:30.188
the British American uh invasion of Italy. And that

633
00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:34.909
was a specific military plan, what's going on now

634
00:38:34.918 --> 00:38:37.340
, even though we're not quite identifying the source of

635
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.668
it. This is what the Russians are doing.

636
00:38:38.398 --> 00:38:40.840
They said we're going to blow up this dam and

637
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:45.458
we're gonna flood this entire area to impede the movement

638
00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:49.688
of, of, of military activity and this gets

639
00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:53.300
back to the seasons in which empires within Africa,

640
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:57.469
within Ethiopia. For example, the the the armies

641
00:38:57.478 --> 00:39:00.369
moved only during the dry season. If you move

642
00:39:00.378 --> 00:39:02.208
during the wet season, then the areas with malarial

643
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.369
. Uh so the seasonality of wind moisture is available

644
00:39:06.378 --> 00:39:08.340
is a big deal militarily in terms of the production

645
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:12.769
of food. In terms of, you know,

646
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.519
if you, if you look at people who are

647
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.228
traveling, describing events in Africa or the conditions in

648
00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:20.590
Africa, Europeans writing down what they're, what they're

649
00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:22.030
encountering, they only traveled in the dry season.

650
00:39:22.668 --> 00:39:24.849
They're only giving a partial view of what they're seeing

651
00:39:25.128 --> 00:39:29.329
because they wouldn't go during the wet season because it's

652
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.260
one, it's muddy two, it's malarial and the

653
00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:36.969
local merchants and, and uh moving around are only

654
00:39:36.978 --> 00:39:40.849
doing their movement during that seasonality. The seasons change

655
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.628
, different parts of Africa, but it's that seasonal

656
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:47.599
change and the, the issue of climate change,

657
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.550
which is now having major effects, right? Uh

658
00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:57.619
So I would like to ask you one last question

659
00:39:57.628 --> 00:40:00.869
slash topic. So, uh of course, when

660
00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:04.500
it comes to history, um I would like to

661
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.780
ask you, what do you think of approaches by

662
00:40:07.789 --> 00:40:13.260
people like Jared Diamond when it comes to explaining why

663
00:40:13.269 --> 00:40:17.929
certain societies became more successful than others and what we

664
00:40:17.938 --> 00:40:22.378
could call or at least some people call uh geographical

665
00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:27.179
determinism. Well, that's always been a factor of

666
00:40:27.188 --> 00:40:30.628
how much is, are the conditions deterministic and Jared

667
00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:34.300
Diamond lays out an argument. That's interesting. To

668
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:37.418
challenge and it's good that it's there. And it's

669
00:40:37.429 --> 00:40:39.898
, it's, it's an attempt at universal explanation of

670
00:40:40.148 --> 00:40:46.219
human movement, human political economic domination based around on

671
00:40:46.228 --> 00:40:50.300
environmental issues to some degree. That's true. Um

672
00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:53.889
And I think that that any consideration of politics or

673
00:40:53.898 --> 00:40:59.050
of economic change or of interaction between different kinds of

674
00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:02.219
political systems um has its foundations, environmental issue in

675
00:41:02.228 --> 00:41:07.300
environmental issues. The fact that Europeans coming to Africa

676
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:08.260
or even to North America or to, to the

677
00:41:08.269 --> 00:41:12.668
new world. It's about the movement of knowledge.

678
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.070
Part of that Colombian circulation I mentioned was the arrival

679
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:21.519
in Latin America of people who knew how to deal

680
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:25.898
with couple of climates. The people, the the

681
00:41:25.909 --> 00:41:30.728
the selection of who is that most valued as labor

682
00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:35.139
out of the slave trade, going to the to

683
00:41:35.148 --> 00:41:37.478
the Carolinas in the US because the ones who are

684
00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:39.719
most valued came from Santa Gambia. They knew how

685
00:41:39.728 --> 00:41:44.708
to grow rice and the the plantation owners. And

686
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:47.769
so in, in um in the Carolinas were stayed

687
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.110
in their, their uplands and in areas that were

688
00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:53.699
not so much so affected by malaria or other diseases

689
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.559
and their, their African slaves were allowed to move

690
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.039
into swampy areas because they knew how to grow.

691
00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:07.349
Um love rima rice. They were adapting the environment

692
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.628
, they knew, they knew how to deal with

693
00:42:08.639 --> 00:42:12.329
health, knew how to deal with production. And

694
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.708
so the knowledge that moved into the new world also

695
00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:20.139
was a key part of this whole exchange and politics

696
00:42:20.148 --> 00:42:24.010
got into who controlled who but also adaptation to environmental

697
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:29.228
issues. If you want to understand the geography of

698
00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.820
Ethiopia is a, is a place that's a place

699
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:34.708
I work. Most, you know, look at

700
00:42:35.059 --> 00:42:38.418
climate seasonality and you see that people would move in

701
00:42:38.429 --> 00:42:42.289
and out of areas that were affected by malaria or

702
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.820
where they could grow one crop or another crop and

703
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:46.059
then harvest it and get back to a safer area

704
00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:50.559
. Big factor and you a diamond is helpful to

705
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:57.550
have that, that um that perspective that is environmental

706
00:42:57.559 --> 00:43:00.010
determinism, but they will have nuance by local areas

707
00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:02.168
. And that's the beautiful part of doing the,

708
00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:05.340
doing the work and working with different people in different

709
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.010
places. Mhm. So, yeah. Uh I

710
00:43:07.019 --> 00:43:09.409
mean, I've also asked you about that because of

711
00:43:09.418 --> 00:43:14.489
course, a big part of Jared Diamond's argument is

712
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.119
based on uh crops also, of course domesticated animals

713
00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:22.994
in certain specific latitudes in the world. Uh And

714
00:43:23.003 --> 00:43:27.284
uh since of course, our interview has been focused

715
00:43:27.293 --> 00:43:30.914
so much on maize and we touched on some other

716
00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:32.885
crops as well. Uh I was wondering, I

717
00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:38.804
mean, to what extent you would think um the

718
00:43:38.813 --> 00:43:44.284
factors that Jared Diamond points to uh I, I

719
00:43:44.293 --> 00:43:46.523
mean, what uh how much of a role do

720
00:43:46.534 --> 00:43:52.530
you think they would play in human history? Well

721
00:43:52.539 --> 00:43:54.199
, I would add to Jared Diamond as, as

722
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:59.550
a um kind of marker of environmental determinism with a

723
00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:02.760
reasonable coherent and somewhat persuasive argument. But look at

724
00:44:02.769 --> 00:44:07.510
Alfred Crosby who coined the term the Columbian exchange that

725
00:44:07.519 --> 00:44:12.849
I modified to publicly of the interaction. Um It

726
00:44:12.978 --> 00:44:19.280
is is that uh Alfred Crosby talks about the the

727
00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:22.510
biological imperialism because the the arrival in the new world

728
00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:28.458
of cattle and pigs, right? And chickens and

729
00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:32.750
part of this global circulation transforms the the physical environment

730
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:37.369
. When you release hogs into the environment, they

731
00:44:37.378 --> 00:44:40.110
are extremely good at going feral and they, they

732
00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:43.449
, they change the physical world they live in and

733
00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:46.289
humans are both either hunting them or trying to domesticate

734
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.969
them or the the animals and the plants, of

735
00:44:50.978 --> 00:44:52.949
course, maize being a big one of globalization,

736
00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:57.239
but this is also true of other, other crops

737
00:44:57.478 --> 00:45:00.128
and other kinds of animals. Um you know,

738
00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:05.070
goats, sheep, cattle, horses, all of

739
00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:07.878
these things that transform the worlds they they move to

740
00:45:07.918 --> 00:45:13.250
and the adaptation of local populations quickly to the horse

741
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.579
. For example, you know, native Americans in

742
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.478
North America adaptations of the horse, suddenly they become

743
00:45:19.489 --> 00:45:22.539
mobile, suddenly they, they're able to hunt in

744
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.050
different ways. Suddenly they're able to, to to

745
00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:29.989
expand their own local local control over different com competing

746
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.110
groups in new, in new ways. So the

747
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:36.329
the Alfred Crosby approach to this, which has been

748
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.840
adapted by people, scholars from, from all over

749
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:42.059
the world are incorporating these ideas and and playing them

750
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.469
out in local areas that makes sense for them.

751
00:45:44.639 --> 00:45:47.949
But Jared Diamond more popular is, is something to

752
00:45:47.958 --> 00:45:51.320
read. Uh It's kind of New York Times best

753
00:45:51.329 --> 00:45:53.829
seller list. But the Alfred Crosby stuff is also

754
00:45:54.119 --> 00:46:00.099
uh to me uh very good. And the colleagues

755
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.579
I work with who are specialists when I, when

756
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:06.280
I go someplace, it's not that I know things

757
00:46:06.679 --> 00:46:08.329
others don't know. But I absorb as his historian

758
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.519
, I'm absorbing the knowledge and interacting with my colleagues

759
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.909
, whether it's in Ghana, we were talking about

760
00:46:14.918 --> 00:46:17.179
the introduction of maize or in Ethiopia where we're driving

761
00:46:17.188 --> 00:46:20.239
through the countryside and I'm saying, what's going on

762
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.579
there? We're walking through the countryside. And I'm

763
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.989
always asking questions because they have the knowledge that I've

764
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.949
been trying to interpret for a larger uh audience as

765
00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:32.398
an academic, as a historian. So these things

766
00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:35.728
are very, very global, it helps to have

767
00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:38.648
people kind of tweaking the narrative by publishing books like

768
00:46:38.659 --> 00:46:40.688
Jared Diamond. But it's not that we say gee

769
00:46:40.699 --> 00:46:44.519
he's got it. Right. Um He's after all

770
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.668
, you know, his original background, he's a

771
00:46:45.679 --> 00:46:52.239
gastroenterologist. Mhm. Right. And we trust doctors

772
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.349
to a degree. Yes. Yeah. Right.

773
00:46:55.510 --> 00:47:00.860
So uh Doctor mccann, uh I'm leaving a link

774
00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:04.418
to your book Maze And Grace, a History of

775
00:47:04.429 --> 00:47:07.780
Africa's encounter with the new World Cup crop in the

776
00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:09.760
description box of the interview. Uh Would you like

777
00:47:09.769 --> 00:47:14.860
to mention any places on the internet where people can

778
00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:17.219
find your work? Well, I think the internet

779
00:47:17.228 --> 00:47:19.679
being what it is, you can, you can

780
00:47:19.688 --> 00:47:22.449
do that. Um What I'm getting now, I

781
00:47:22.458 --> 00:47:24.728
just was at Oxford University Press asked me to write

782
00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:30.360
a chapter on malaria in Africa. And malaria in

783
00:47:30.369 --> 00:47:32.159
Africa came from my own work with, again,

784
00:47:32.168 --> 00:47:37.019
with colleagues um who work on malaria in Africa and

785
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.369
elsewhere. But um people I got malaria when I

786
00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:42.500
was doing field work in Africa uh in, in

787
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.280
Ethiopia, you know, an area where the maize

788
00:47:45.289 --> 00:47:46.878
stuff was going on. And I didn't ask go

789
00:47:46.889 --> 00:47:50.369
malaria. But suddenly I had 100 and five degree

790
00:47:50.378 --> 00:47:52.860
fever and had to go back out of my my

791
00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:57.769
rural area five hours by mule to get to the

792
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.219
nearest road to the nearest light bulb. Oh my

793
00:48:00.228 --> 00:48:05.429
God. And so malaria became an interest and the

794
00:48:05.438 --> 00:48:07.619
maze. Malaria connection is one chapter of of um

795
00:48:07.648 --> 00:48:12.869
maize and grace. And so male malaria is where

796
00:48:12.878 --> 00:48:15.010
I I appear on the internet. I'm constantly getting

797
00:48:15.019 --> 00:48:16.750
notes saying you've been cited by these 100 times.

798
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:22.179
I said really I'm not doing and it's, it's

799
00:48:22.188 --> 00:48:24.438
mainly now about the medical malaria stuff that links to

800
00:48:24.449 --> 00:48:28.228
the maze. All these things are linked. Um

801
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.228
And now back to the North Fundament of water in

802
00:48:31.239 --> 00:48:36.019
which I'm doing a plenary panel for a international meeting

803
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.039
in Finland next year. And that is to draw

804
00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:43.250
people together around what is the meaning of water?

805
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.800
Meanings of water as something physical is something psychological is

806
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:52.909
something cultural and water takes us to all kinds of

807
00:48:52.918 --> 00:48:55.398
ways that people signify their sainthood if they're in a

808
00:48:55.409 --> 00:48:59.889
, in a, uh religious religious setting. Um

809
00:49:00.059 --> 00:49:01.579
, and for example, in the 88, the

810
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:06.849
18 fifties, this short story, the British traveler

811
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.219
in Ethiopia came down with fever and it's called eu

812
00:49:10.228 --> 00:49:13.208
, he understood this as I have a fever.

813
00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:15.958
What do I do? He's riding around the countryside

814
00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:16.619
with people and they said, what you need to

815
00:49:16.628 --> 00:49:19.860
do is stand in this tree and we're gonna dump

816
00:49:19.869 --> 00:49:22.110
water on your head and this will deal with your

817
00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:23.059
fever. He said, well, first of all

818
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.280
, it knocked him off, his horse, knocked

819
00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:29.119
him senseless and he felt slightly better at the end

820
00:49:29.128 --> 00:49:31.378
of this ordeal. At the same time, there's

821
00:49:31.389 --> 00:49:35.820
someone in Malvern England who's going through a water therapy

822
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:38.389
treatment, somewhat, somewhat similar and that person was

823
00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:44.239
Charles Darwin. So water is this, this,

824
00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.260
this universal, of course, it's universal, but

825
00:49:46.269 --> 00:49:52.179
the nuances and local cultures and local material versus belief

826
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:54.090
systems is the thing that I'm working on now.

827
00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:58.519
And you find examples of that all over the world

828
00:49:58.668 --> 00:50:02.019
where suddenly cli that links to climate change. Very

829
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:07.070
interesting. So, Doctor mccann, uh thank you

830
00:50:07.079 --> 00:50:08.619
so much for taking the time to come on the

831
00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:12.148
show. It's been a real pleasure to talk to

832
00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:15.500
you too. Say no or the equivalent of the

833
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:19.559
Italian. Yeah. In this case, uh it

834
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.860
would be bo part here. It's still the afternoons

835
00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:25.800
. OK? Time change, time change. So

836
00:50:25.978 --> 00:50:29.889
