00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.849
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.169
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loup.

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.820
And today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:11.890
Luis Favela, associate Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences

5
00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:14.778
at the University of Central Florida. And today we're

6
00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:18.539
talking about his book, The Ecological Brain Unifying The

7
00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:21.949
Sciences of Brain, body and Environment. And by

8
00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.059
the way, I'm leaving a link to our first

9
00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:27.388
interview in the description box down below which is which

10
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.318
to a certain extent is also relevant to the interview

11
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.209
today. So Doctor Favela, welcome back to the

12
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.020
show. It's always a pleasure to talk to you

13
00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.029
. Thank you Ricardo. I appreciate the invitation looking

14
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.929
forward to it. So I, I mean,

15
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:43.728
the way I would like to go through things here

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.228
today is that uh first of all, I would

17
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.200
like to get into what ecological psychology and neuroscience are

18
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:54.939
because those are the two main disciplines that you explore

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.868
in the book and also the relationship between them and

20
00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.689
how they historically sort of came apart theoretically, methodologically

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.838
and so on and then get into the framework that

22
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:08.540
you bring into the book that you present there that

23
00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.069
perhaps can bring them back together and perhaps other aspects

24
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.918
of our psychology. And so to start off with

25
00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:23.120
what is ecological psychology? Really? Yeah. So

26
00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:26.480
I think when, um, people hear the term

27
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:30.079
ecological psychology, I think if they think of anything

28
00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:33.269
they think of, um, psychology related to the

29
00:01:33.278 --> 00:01:36.189
environment. And so commonly when I talk to people

30
00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.198
, they've said, oh, so you study,

31
00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:41.579
uh how productive people are depending on what color their

32
00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:44.519
room is. So if their room is painted red

33
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.049
, then that means the ecology causes them to be

34
00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:49.359
angry and agitated. And I'm like, well,

35
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.939
maybe, but that's not what we mean here in

36
00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:53.799
this case. So, uh when I say ecological

37
00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:59.299
psychology, I'm referring to a tradition and perceptual psychology

38
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.528
uh that originates with James Gibson in the mid 20th

39
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.269
century around the 19 fifties. Um And also with

40
00:02:06.278 --> 00:02:07.960
his uh spouse Eleanor Gibson, also around at the

41
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.399
same time. So ecological psychology was a bit of

42
00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:20.319
a reaction to um the uh more popular um or

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.389
increasingly popular approaches to perception uh around the mid 20th

44
00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.449
century. And so around that time, you had

45
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.000
something called the cognitive revolution. And so the cognitive

46
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:35.169
revolution was pushing back against uh behaviorist approaches. And

47
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.550
so behaviorism in the late 18 hundreds, early 19

48
00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:42.409
hundreds argued that um if there's anything to, to

49
00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.219
a mind or to be mental, really, what

50
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.500
matters for a scientific study of that is what can

51
00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:51.250
be observed in behavior. And so the idea was

52
00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.050
we can try to explain even the most complex behaviors

53
00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:58.058
by things like a, a reflex or stimulus response

54
00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.270
uh rules um that an organism develops over its lifetime

55
00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:06.240
or even over eve evolutionary time scales, the cognitive

56
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.379
revolution came along and said, well, that's,

57
00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.219
you know, kind of interesting and you can explain

58
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.699
a lot of stuff that way, but there seems

59
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.500
to be a lot of mental things happening that you

60
00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:19.679
can't explain just by looking at the environment and then

61
00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.278
the, the response that the organism has. And

62
00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:25.618
so Noam Chomsky has this famous pushback argument against behaviorism

63
00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.740
uh where he said, um the environment is too

64
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.205
impoverished, it's too poor with information for uh example

65
00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:39.014
, language learning. So an infant that's starting to

66
00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:43.493
learn language, um even if it's exposed much of

67
00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:46.375
the day to his parents talking and family talking,

68
00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:49.044
that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the

69
00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:53.344
richness and the seemingly infinite combination of words that a

70
00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:55.474
human being learns how to use. And so Chomsky

71
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:59.710
and others that came along later. So there must

72
00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.429
be some things that are already built into the mind

73
00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.490
. And so, yeah, maybe there's stimulus in

74
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.569
the environment and then there are responses from the organism

75
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.409
, but those responses are gonna be based on innate

76
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.288
structures that are already in the brain. And so

77
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.545
the launched a whole new paradigm, if you will

78
00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:18.923
a whole new way of doing psychology which said,

79
00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:21.254
we don't have to treat the inside of the organism

80
00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:24.004
like a black box, right? Where you have

81
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.963
your input, some magic happens and then you get

82
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.785
an output. No, we can start looking at

83
00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:31.199
those structures. And around that time also what became

84
00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:35.759
popular was uh computers. So the computational devices were

85
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:39.238
becoming more and more popular. And people said,

86
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.759
wow, you know, computers, they, they

87
00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.459
, they have these like internal rules and they can

88
00:04:43.608 --> 00:04:45.670
, you know, give them certain kind of inputs

89
00:04:45.678 --> 00:04:46.838
and they get really complex outputs and it seems like

90
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.170
you can mix that up and almost infinite ways.

91
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.199
And so that there was a marriage between these different

92
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.670
approaches, um artificial intelligence at the time, linguistics

93
00:04:57.678 --> 00:04:59.588
and some other sub fields as well. And they

94
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.730
came together and they said, well, then things

95
00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:06.389
like perception must also require some internal uh properties as

96
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:11.548
well. And so you can't really explain something like

97
00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.548
detecting distance just based on the stimulus. Because for

98
00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.488
example, if you had a little tree that was

99
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.709
up close to you or you had a big tree

100
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.838
that was far away from you, if all that

101
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.309
it requires for vision is the information and the environment

102
00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.129
. Well, the little tree and the big tree

103
00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.410
on the same line would cast the same image on

104
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.600
your retinal cells. So you wouldn't be able to

105
00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:41.350
tell they would look the same spot. Thus,

106
00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.358
we must have certain rules in our mind that allows

107
00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:47.178
us to maybe take cues from the environment. Um

108
00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:49.709
uh We see things that maybe, maybe in the

109
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.548
angles of shadows or something like that might tell us

110
00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.858
that something is further away than it is closer.

111
00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:00.819
So computers and the idea that you would represent the

112
00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.399
environment in your mind and then manipulate it computationally.

113
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.619
This became the dominant way of doing things in the

114
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.500
mid 20th century. Well, here comes ecological psychology

115
00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:11.829
, sorry for all the history, but you kind

116
00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.980
of need to know some of that to, to

117
00:06:13.988 --> 00:06:15.699
appreciate what Gibson was doing. A and by the

118
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.730
way, just to mention that in our first interview

119
00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:25.129
, we talked more extensively about computational representational approaches.

120
00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.363
So we if people want to go back there and

121
00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:30.653
watch that be that bit again because it provides even

122
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:34.303
more con context, I guess to what we're talking

123
00:06:34.314 --> 00:06:36.524
about here. So, yeah, exactly. Yeah

124
00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:40.884
. Thank you, Ricardo. Um So Gibson said

125
00:06:40.894 --> 00:06:43.829
, well, um he was, he was actually

126
00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:46.369
he was a, a scientist uh in the army

127
00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.358
and in, in the US military. And he

128
00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:51.579
was um tasked with trying to help develop training better

129
00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:56.069
training methods for pilots because he said pilots, they

130
00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.329
were treating uh the environment like a Cartesian coordinate system

131
00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:03.928
where it's just abstract kind of space of three dimensions

132
00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:06.064
on an A season. So uh if you want

133
00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:09.994
to land your plane and survive, uh you want

134
00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:12.903
to think of yourself as one point in that coordinate

135
00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:15.084
system and then the landing field and the plane and

136
00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:17.375
another part of that coordinate system, and then you

137
00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:19.535
try and calculate that. Well, it turns out

138
00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:23.394
the pilots were really bad at learning to fly that

139
00:07:23.403 --> 00:07:26.053
way. So he said, well, what do

140
00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:29.444
pilots actually do when they land successfully? He said

141
00:07:29.454 --> 00:07:32.079
they actually pay attention to what the environment is doing

142
00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:34.528
in relation to themselves. And so he picked up

143
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.079
on the notion of optic flow as something that guides

144
00:07:40.088 --> 00:07:42.048
uh the ability of pilots to land. And he

145
00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:44.649
said, maybe if we train the pilots to focus

146
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.588
on optic flow, so that's when the environment is

147
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.309
moving in your your space of vision. If we

148
00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.769
tell them focus on the optic flow of the runway

149
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.588
, and we try and coordinate our sense of our

150
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.069
body in relation to that optic flow, maybe people

151
00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:00.290
will land better and it turns out that it did

152
00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:01.250
, it worked out better for them to think of

153
00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:05.434
things in, in that sense instead of the abstract

154
00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:07.384
sense. So this is one of the early also

155
00:08:07.394 --> 00:08:11.884
approaches um that became known as embodied cognition or embodied

156
00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:15.053
mind, the idea that you get your sense of

157
00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:18.903
body or your app proprioception and your haptic senses as

158
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.963
a way of gaining information about the world. And

159
00:08:20.975 --> 00:08:24.504
so what did Gibson then do from this simple lesson

160
00:08:24.514 --> 00:08:28.420
? He said, well, maybe, maybe the

161
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:33.219
environment actually is rich with information, maybe um organisms

162
00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:37.379
don't represent the world in their minds as much as

163
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:39.558
we think they do if at all, maybe what

164
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.940
they do is they leverage things like optic flow or

165
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.719
the ambient light in a room or things like that

166
00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.940
. And so how do we know that the little

167
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.798
tree is up close and the big tree is further

168
00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:56.450
away? Well, we know that because of information

169
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.950
in the environment like parallax, the parallax is what

170
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.889
happens when something uh is up close. And if

171
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.369
you're moving, it seems like it's moving faster.

172
00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:07.580
If something is far away and you're moving at the

173
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.960
same speed, it seems like it's moving slower.

174
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:11.840
So if you've been in a car or on a

175
00:09:11.849 --> 00:09:15.950
train and you look outside and you look down and

176
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.548
you see the road moving really fast, but then

177
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.149
you look at the distance and it looks like the

178
00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:22.724
mountains are barely moving at all. That's parallax.

179
00:09:22.844 --> 00:09:26.965
And that information is in the environment. It's nothing

180
00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:28.455
that's represented in the brain or in the mind.

181
00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:33.154
So Gibson launched this whole new approach to doing perceptual

182
00:09:33.163 --> 00:09:37.293
psychology based on the idea that the environment is not

183
00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:41.955
impoverished the way Chomsky and the cognitive revolution uh neuros

184
00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:43.724
or scientists said, but that we can actually use

185
00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:50.509
the environment to um inform even complex actions. And

186
00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.460
so from there, here's the last main bit from

187
00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:56.379
there, he developed the term uh affordances. And

188
00:09:56.389 --> 00:10:00.168
so I think uh this is a common term now

189
00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:05.308
outside of ecological psychology, roboticists, people in education

190
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.460
, all sorts of different people in art design,

191
00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:11.038
they use the term afford it uh loosely what it

192
00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:13.119
means is opportunities to do things in the world.

193
00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.918
So when I see this cup in front of me

194
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.658
with little paints of Nietzsche on it, it affords

195
00:10:20.668 --> 00:10:26.178
grasping if the features of the object and my body

196
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.820
have a nice match, right? If the cup

197
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.428
is too tiny for my fingers or if it's gigantic

198
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.859
and I can't grab it, then it does not

199
00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.590
afford grasping. And so Gibson said, it's likely

200
00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:41.428
that any organism that is perceiving the world from a

201
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.830
little ant to a grasshopper to a dog, to

202
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.649
a chimp to a human is likely perceiving opportunities to

203
00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:54.200
do things in the world. And those opportunities are

204
00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:58.460
constrained by the organisms sense of its body. So

205
00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:01.820
it's embodiment and then information in the environment. So

206
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.759
that's what ecological psychology in this case boils down to

207
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:09.869
the idea of an organism, environment system that can

208
00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.908
act intelligently in the world based on embodiment and environmental

209
00:11:13.918 --> 00:11:20.389
or ecological information. And so that's about ecological psychology

210
00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.469
. But then how does neuroscience get into the picture

211
00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:28.379
of what you explore in your book? Uh Perhaps

212
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:30.149
, I mean, we have to go through some

213
00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:33.690
of the main historical developments here as well uh to

214
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:39.349
then understand why it is that psychology uh or ecological

215
00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:46.129
psychology and neuroscience uh theoretically conceptually and methodologically, at

216
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:50.908
least at first sight seem irreconcilable. Yeah. So

217
00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:54.250
the uh historical story that I try to tell uh

218
00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:56.899
in the book is one in which you've got multiple

219
00:11:56.908 --> 00:12:03.190
strands of research happening uh investigating mind in different ways

220
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.729
. Um So there are people do perceptual psychology,

221
00:12:05.739 --> 00:12:07.759
for example, you know, there are gyps ecological

222
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:11.649
psychology, cognitive psychologists and the like and so,

223
00:12:11.658 --> 00:12:16.389
neuroscience. Um uh and again, this is just

224
00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.710
painting in broad strokes, right? So there's always

225
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:20.960
gonna be exceptions and things like that. But painting

226
00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:24.500
in broad strokes, neuroscience is very much um what

227
00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:28.080
I'll call it a anatomical or physiological discipline. I

228
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.178
was interested in what are the um the bodily constituents

229
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.979
of the nervous system, right? What are,

230
00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:37.129
what are nerve cells? What are neurons? What

231
00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:37.750
are glial cells? How do they work? How

232
00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:41.219
do they act? And so fast forwarding a bit

233
00:12:41.229 --> 00:12:45.950
. How do those anatomical units connect to things like

234
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.979
intelligent behavior or memory or problem solving? And so

235
00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:54.099
, as I try to tell in the book Neuroscience

236
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.979
, especially things like Perceptual Neuroscience or cognitive neuroscience,

237
00:12:56.989 --> 00:13:01.399
things more concerned with um the type of phenomena that

238
00:13:01.408 --> 00:13:05.090
are studied in psychology, for example, um they

239
00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:09.788
inherited a lot of the uh theoretical approaches from the

240
00:13:09.798 --> 00:13:15.808
cognitive revolution. So the cognitive revolution sparked this approach

241
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.048
which uh we call cognitive and cognitive is was the

242
00:13:20.058 --> 00:13:24.139
idea that cognition, uh intelligent behavior, perception,

243
00:13:24.149 --> 00:13:28.849
memory, um the control of movement, co-ordinated movement

244
00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:33.340
. All these things are essentially computational and representational in

245
00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:37.210
nature. And So as I mentioned a few minutes

246
00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.739
ago, the idea is that uh it's not just

247
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.940
stimulus from the environment and response uh from whatever is

248
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.340
happening in the body. And you don't need to

249
00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:46.399
pay attention to what's happening in the brain, right

250
00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:50.798
? The black box. But inside here are computations

251
00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:54.288
that are manipulating representations. So when I speak a

252
00:13:54.298 --> 00:13:58.029
language, I have representations of words and sounds,

253
00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.719
the computations organize those in certain ways that give me

254
00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:05.379
uh language comprehension, for example. So as I

255
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:09.460
argue in the book, Neuroscience inherited this way of

256
00:14:09.469 --> 00:14:16.889
thinking about uh organisms as these brains or neurons or

257
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:22.969
nervous systems that are conducting computations and they're manipulating representations

258
00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:24.779
of the world. And so when you think about

259
00:14:24.788 --> 00:14:28.779
a computer that manipulates bits like ones and zeros,

260
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.928
right? So whenever you write a computer program,

261
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.658
it's made up of strings of ones and zeros and

262
00:14:33.668 --> 00:14:37.808
certain kinds of ones and zeros give you a tiktok

263
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.460
video or one gives you music or one gives you

264
00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:43.710
a game you're gonna play, it's all still ones

265
00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:46.879
and zeros. And so the idea was that neurons

266
00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:50.908
which were thought of as simple firing units. So

267
00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:52.349
they either fire or they don't. So they set

268
00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:58.489
off an action potential. Maybe theoretically speaking, neuroscientists

269
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.798
are history club, maybe those spikes can be thought

270
00:15:01.808 --> 00:15:03.158
of as like a one. And when it's not

271
00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:07.479
spiking, it's like a zero and so taken together

272
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:09.649
, you know, these millions and millions of spiking

273
00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.239
ones and zeros are like the millions and millions of

274
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.090
zeros and ones in a computer. And so the

275
00:15:15.099 --> 00:15:18.519
brain must be a kind of computational device. So

276
00:15:18.908 --> 00:15:24.474
Neuroscience inherits this way of thinking about thinking uh thinking

277
00:15:24.484 --> 00:15:28.673
about nervous systems as essentially a kind of wet computer

278
00:15:28.783 --> 00:15:30.144
, right? It's not made out of silicon,

279
00:15:30.154 --> 00:15:31.325
like my macbook, but it's made out of,

280
00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:33.965
you know, cells and blood and water and proteins

281
00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:37.404
and all this kind of stuff. But essentially it's

282
00:15:37.413 --> 00:15:39.408
doing the same thing as a computer. Now.

283
00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:43.408
Where did the split come in between neuroscience and ecological

284
00:15:43.418 --> 00:15:46.729
psychology? Well, right from the beginning, right

285
00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:48.609
, from the start, there's a big split and

286
00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:52.668
the big split is that neuroscience inherits this view that

287
00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:56.558
the environment is too impoverished to provide a kind of

288
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.239
information that can guide intelligent action, for example,

289
00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:04.340
whereas the ecological psychologist says the environment is rich with

290
00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:10.239
information which can guide intelligent behavior and action. And

291
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.580
so right there from the start, you have one

292
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.359
fundamental break that happens right there. The neuroscience test

293
00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:19.820
is put in uh their, their bets on the

294
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.389
cognitive this theory and they're saying it's gonna be all

295
00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.460
about what's happening in the brain or the, or

296
00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:27.940
the, you know, cognitive system. The ecological

297
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.580
psychologist is gonna say actually what's gonna happen is it's

298
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.798
gonna be distributed throughout the body, which includes a

299
00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:37.580
brain, but mostly the overt kind of gross body

300
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.279
and the environment itself. So they're coming at some

301
00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:45.859
of the same targets of investigation, like visual perception

302
00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:48.940
, for example, and they are coming from very

303
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.058
different uh starting points and theoretical commitments. And so

304
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.109
you see that at least since maybe the 19 seventies

305
00:16:56.119 --> 00:17:00.590
or so 19 eighties, that this big split between

306
00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:03.489
these two approaches and it would seem that they are

307
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.588
irreconcilable. They're, they're in some ways, as

308
00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:07.828
I say in the book, in some ways,

309
00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:11.118
they are different worlds, right? For the ecological

310
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.900
psychologist, the world is full of affordances and rich

311
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.959
information that's real, right? For the neuroscientists,

312
00:17:18.969 --> 00:17:22.019
right? What's really real is what's happening in the

313
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:25.769
mind which equals the brain. And so this is

314
00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:29.358
just very radical ways of, of approaching um doing

315
00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:32.338
the same kind of work. And by the way

316
00:17:32.348 --> 00:17:37.939
related to those theoretical slash conceptual foundations that differ between

317
00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:41.500
ecological psychology and neuroscience, one of the things that

318
00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:44.539
you also explore in the book, in this case

319
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:49.539
regarding neuroscience is that you talk about two different traditions

320
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:52.578
in neuroscience. And uh I would like you to

321
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:57.814
tell us about them and then perhaps explain why does

322
00:17:57.824 --> 00:18:00.035
it matter in the context of your book? So

323
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:04.814
one of them is focused on biological features of neurons

324
00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:08.375
that is the Hodgkin Ley tradition. And the other

325
00:18:08.384 --> 00:18:14.064
one more on abstract features of neurons, the mccullough

326
00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:18.515
pits tradition. So what are those traditions really about

327
00:18:18.525 --> 00:18:19.864
in what ways do they differ? And why does

328
00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:25.338
it matter for your book specifically? Yeah, great

329
00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:26.160
, great um question. I'm glad you, you

330
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.799
asked that. So, as I said, the

331
00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:32.618
earlier days of neuroscience that I presented in the book

332
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.160
and this very broad sketches, it's very focused on

333
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.689
anatomy uh and looking at what the anatomy itself is

334
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:42.180
like. And so uh Hodgkin and Huxley did this

335
00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:45.430
pioneering work um in the, you know, mid

336
00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:49.049
20th century where they created some of the earlier models

337
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.824
of single neuron activity. And so they looked at

338
00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:56.775
uh squid neurons. Um uh squid was a a

339
00:18:56.785 --> 00:19:00.384
great case because their neurons and their axons were so

340
00:19:00.394 --> 00:19:03.295
big that they could actually feed them with uh very

341
00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:04.943
simple microscopes. They wouldn't need these like high powered

342
00:19:04.953 --> 00:19:08.074
electron microscope. So they could test the anatomy in

343
00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:11.910
a in a in a in a pretty broad,

344
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.199
highly detailed way. And what they focused on was

345
00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:18.489
what are the contributions of different kind of molecular activity

346
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.279
, calcium, uh things like that. Um And

347
00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:26.750
what's happening when the cell is acting in a way

348
00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:27.699
to say, make you know, the tentacle move

349
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.650
or something like that. What they found was this

350
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.989
is a very dynamic kind of activity, right?

351
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.759
This is a temporal activity, right? So there's

352
00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:38.868
time before the neuron fires and there's build up and

353
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.519
there's activity and and say the calcium channels and things

354
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:44.949
like that in there and then it hits a certain

355
00:19:44.959 --> 00:19:45.630
point and then boom, you get the spike of

356
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.549
activity and then it kind of dissipates and it's prepared

357
00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:51.140
for another spike, right? And so this was

358
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.689
a very temporal kind of way of thinking about it

359
00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:55.930
. So earlier days of Neuroscience, some of the

360
00:19:55.939 --> 00:20:00.828
biggest achievements focused on the combination of anatomy and dynamics

361
00:20:00.838 --> 00:20:04.150
or time around the same period uh in history,

362
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.930
you had some other pioneering work happening by a,

363
00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:11.390
a couple of um gentlemen mcculloch and Pitts and what

364
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.799
they said was let's try and think about uh abstractly

365
00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:21.469
what's happening here. So how do we um reconceive

366
00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:26.279
the anatomy in mathematical terms, though not modeling the

367
00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:30.779
anatomy, not modeling the activity with mathematical tools,

368
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:33.759
but thinking about what the anatomy is doing as calculating

369
00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:37.209
as a kind of mathematical kind of phenomenon. So

370
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:42.799
they developed um some the earliest mathematical models of uh

371
00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:48.618
neural activity. So the mcculloch Pitts model um and

372
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.459
they treated uh these models as simple on and off

373
00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:56.338
switches, right? So the the neural network as

374
00:20:56.348 --> 00:20:57.588
we come to talk about them today, neural network

375
00:20:57.598 --> 00:21:00.078
models, right? It's a collection of these ones

376
00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.489
and zeros or that these systems that are weighted,

377
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.479
right? And it's all mathematical. And so this

378
00:21:07.489 --> 00:21:10.318
mcculloch hits of the quick little aside that work was

379
00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:15.088
foundational to um the popular kind of models that we

380
00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:18.430
see now known as like large language models. So

381
00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:22.269
chat GP T um all these different kinds of systems

382
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.084
that are so popular and and and controversial in the

383
00:21:25.094 --> 00:21:29.144
news lately, these are all defendants of the mcculloch

384
00:21:29.193 --> 00:21:33.434
Pitts model which treated cognition and thinking as essentially kind

385
00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:37.064
of like a mathematical phenomenon. It's all about calculations

386
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.279
. So you have these two traditions that were being

387
00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:42.650
practiced. And I think it's fair to say that

388
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.368
the Macao Pits tradition which focused on the mathematics and

389
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.259
the computations and the abstraction away from the anatomy.

390
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.959
That's definitely the one that has become the most popular

391
00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:56.390
. Again. Look at the successes of neural network

392
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.229
models like, you know, chat GP T and

393
00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:03.019
stuff like that for the purposes of the book.

394
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:06.699
Though I point out that um and this is related

395
00:22:06.709 --> 00:22:10.559
to another paper that I wrote called the Dynamical Renaissance

396
00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:15.420
in Neuroscience is that while there has been a great

397
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.818
popularity in the abstraction away from neurons and into developing

398
00:22:18.828 --> 00:22:22.358
these neural networks, there's also been a refocusing as

399
00:22:22.368 --> 00:22:26.838
well on the dynamics and the timing of neural systems

400
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.640
. And so what we're seeing is more and more

401
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.930
focus on uh nonlinear dynamics, things like that um

402
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:37.489
as being essential to nervous systems. And so it's

403
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.068
not just about like what calculations they're producing, which

404
00:22:41.078 --> 00:22:44.078
don't really matter, like how fast they go or

405
00:22:44.088 --> 00:22:45.259
how slow they go. It's just a number of

406
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:48.430
steps and you can do the steps fast, you

407
00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:51.118
can do the steps slow, but you get the

408
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.868
same output. But there's been a new appreciation for

409
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.299
this earlier work which I call the Hot and Huxley

410
00:22:57.309 --> 00:23:00.989
tradition that says it's not just about the steps,

411
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.229
but it's also about how fast they happen or how

412
00:23:03.239 --> 00:23:06.368
slow they happen. And so this renaissance of as

413
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.318
I call it and I talk about in the book

414
00:23:07.328 --> 00:23:11.588
is that neuroscience is repaying attention to the dynamics of

415
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:17.068
what's happening in cognitive systems, intelligence systems and perception

416
00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:18.500
. Um I forget if you had a, a

417
00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:22.828
another part of your question. Uh No, no

418
00:23:22.838 --> 00:23:23.670
, but I, I actually want to ask you

419
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.868
a follow up. So just to see if I

420
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.390
understood it correctly, then these emphasis on abstract features

421
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.910
of neurons actually something that in more recent times as

422
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.318
lether or at least some people in the cognitive sciences

423
00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:45.189
, neuroscience and so on to a more uh dynamical

424
00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:51.500
systems approach to uh cognition, psychology and so on

425
00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:56.539
. Is that correct or? Well? So sometimes

426
00:23:56.709 --> 00:24:00.818
. So um if I understood the question correctly,

427
00:24:00.828 --> 00:24:06.289
are people who are focusing on the abstract computations of

428
00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:08.338
uh neural systems of cognitive systems? Are they now

429
00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:14.890
including dynamics? Um Sometimes they are but not always

430
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.759
necessarily and ST as vice versa, people who focus

431
00:24:17.769 --> 00:24:21.979
on the dynamics are not focusing on the computational properties

432
00:24:21.989 --> 00:24:23.729
per se. So there is some overlap but not

433
00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:27.229
necessarily. So. Um Yeah. Mhm No,

434
00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:30.029
I was just trying to really understand here and perhaps

435
00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:33.750
to some extent I was oversimplifying it, but I

436
00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:37.598
was uh since you mentioned the dynamical Renen in cognitive

437
00:24:37.608 --> 00:24:41.068
science and neuroscience, uh I was just wondering if

438
00:24:41.078 --> 00:24:47.989
really abstracting more from uh neurons for more from their

439
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.489
biological features, not focusing too much on them would

440
00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:56.739
help moving beyond these. I don't know, perhaps

441
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:03.759
brain centered approach and uh computational representational approach to uh

442
00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:08.410
cognition, neuroscience and so on. Well, it's

443
00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:12.689
interesting, I think um there's people who have used

444
00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:17.959
the same evidence to make different conclusions. So some

445
00:25:17.969 --> 00:25:22.250
people have argued that um you know, because nervous

446
00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:25.680
systems and take, you know, humans and other

447
00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:30.338
mammals um because what really matters to intelligence and perception

448
00:25:30.348 --> 00:25:33.410
and memory and all this stuff is the computations in

449
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.049
the nervous system. It doesn't really matter. Um

450
00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:38.630
If it's in a mammal, it, it could

451
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.309
be, you know, in a bird, it

452
00:25:41.318 --> 00:25:42.390
could be an insect, it could be in a

453
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.660
computer, it could be, you know, I

454
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.180
don't know, in a ghost made out of ectoplasm

455
00:25:48.189 --> 00:25:49.250
or something like that. I don't know. Whereas

456
00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:52.049
other people have said no, no, no,

457
00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:53.078
no, no. What the nervous system is doing

458
00:25:53.088 --> 00:25:56.509
is a spec you know, special kind of computation

459
00:25:56.519 --> 00:26:00.529
that's, you know, specific to, you know

460
00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.140
, brains and there's something very special about brains.

461
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.209
Now where the dynamics come in that just adds another

462
00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:07.818
layer, right? Some people say, what's the

463
00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:11.959
computations and the dynamics that prove this, what's the

464
00:26:11.969 --> 00:26:15.239
computations and dynamics that prove that it's been really tough

465
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.309
to, to say uh who's right and who's wrong

466
00:26:18.318 --> 00:26:21.880
in those debates? Mhm Yeah. A actually,

467
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.858
yeah. Now, now that you're mentioning that uh

468
00:26:22.868 --> 00:26:27.890
you're right. So sometimes when there's discussion surrounding uh

469
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:33.630
uh the extent to which uh artificial intelligence, artificial

470
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.368
intelligence systems can be or become humanlike, there's that

471
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.640
idea that perhaps if it's uh just about computations,

472
00:26:42.743 --> 00:26:47.684
I mean, the same computations can be instantiated in

473
00:26:47.824 --> 00:26:52.493
silicon based uh cognitive systems as they are in carbon

474
00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:56.785
based cognitive systems. Right. Mhm. I guess

475
00:26:56.795 --> 00:26:57.684
. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. That's right.

476
00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:02.809
So, but then, uh, we were talking

477
00:27:02.818 --> 00:27:07.108
about uh ecological psychology as well and the relationship or

478
00:27:07.118 --> 00:27:11.838
the lack thereof with ecological psychology and neuroscience. But

479
00:27:11.848 --> 00:27:18.588
then there's also ecological neuroscience. So what is it

480
00:27:18.598 --> 00:27:22.469
? And what's basically the theoretical background behind it?

481
00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:29.430
Yeah. So ecological neuroscience um is a term um

482
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:33.150
used loosely, there's no official kind of discipline called

483
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.689
ecological neuroscience. Ecological Neuroscience term used to refer to

484
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:41.759
people who are attempting to try and bring together uh

485
00:27:41.769 --> 00:27:45.759
these seemingly disparate and irreconcilable approaches to understanding cognition and

486
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.750
perception. So what they wanna do, they wanna

487
00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:52.559
see if the lessons from Gibson and ecological psychology can

488
00:27:52.568 --> 00:27:56.088
be uh integrated with uh what we know about the

489
00:27:56.098 --> 00:28:00.009
nervous system. And so you've got work um going

490
00:28:00.019 --> 00:28:03.250
back at least to the 19 eighties in which people

491
00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:06.459
are paying more attention uh by people. I mean

492
00:28:06.469 --> 00:28:10.680
, ecological psychologists are paying more attention to the contributions

493
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.539
of the nervous system and brain to things like afford

494
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:18.509
its perception. Now, iii I really need to

495
00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:21.910
stress um a couple of things here. So one

496
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:27.529
is that Gibson um James Gibson and his spouse Eleanor

497
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:32.130
Gibson, they were really pushing back against the dominant

498
00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.449
approach, the dominant approach that you just, you

499
00:28:33.459 --> 00:28:37.009
gotta look at the brain, the brain is awesome

500
00:28:37.078 --> 00:28:38.769
and computers are awesome. And we've got all this

501
00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:41.979
technology, we have put all this stuff together and

502
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:42.539
that's where, you know, we're really gonna be

503
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:48.259
explaining things and I think at least strategically, um

504
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.098
you know, the Gibsons especially, you know,

505
00:28:49.108 --> 00:28:52.568
James Gibson and his work on perception was like,

506
00:28:52.578 --> 00:28:56.039
we're not even gonna really talk about the brain,

507
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.299
right? We're not gonna really talk about that.

508
00:28:57.309 --> 00:29:00.380
Like, of course, you know, mammals,

509
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.140
the chimpanzee has a brain, of course, it

510
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.219
has a nervous system, of course, it controls

511
00:29:03.229 --> 00:29:07.068
movement with its nervous system and, and, and

512
00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:10.358
, and brain. But really what matters is that

513
00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:12.358
we need to really appreciate the role of the body

514
00:29:12.368 --> 00:29:17.098
and the role of the environment. And so,

515
00:29:17.328 --> 00:29:22.789
um by not talking about the brain and not emphasizing

516
00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.598
the nervous system, this led a uh uh a

517
00:29:23.608 --> 00:29:30.640
lot of people to think that uh ecological psychologists uh

518
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:36.769
didn't believe in brains that they ignored brains that they

519
00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:38.529
thought maybe that they just didn't exist. Uh So

520
00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:42.769
, for example, um Daniel Dennett, the philosopher

521
00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:47.410
, cognitive scientist, uh he's get some quotes from

522
00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.500
some writings he did in the eighties uh where he

523
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.078
said, you know, people like Gibson, they

524
00:29:52.088 --> 00:29:55.868
treat the brain as if it's a piece of wonder

525
00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.130
tissue it's, it's like it's magical. We don't

526
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.539
even need to explain really how it works or that

527
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.848
there's neurons. It doesn't, it's just, it's

528
00:30:02.858 --> 00:30:04.739
magical. It's a magical part of the body and

529
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.368
it resonates magically with for ins and things like that

530
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.890
. Other people like Carl Pribram also in the 19

531
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.380
eighties. Uh He has this other uh great quote

532
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.880
and I say great cause it's, you know,

533
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.150
it's something special. He says, uh you know

534
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.489
, there are some ecological psychologists that acknowledge that there's

535
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.390
a brain and nervous system. But for people like

536
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.568
James Gibson, uh whether you know, there's really

537
00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:33.459
that stuff on the inside or just foam rubber,

538
00:30:33.469 --> 00:30:36.410
it makes no difference to their theory, right?

539
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:41.009
And so you've got Dennett who thinks uh the Gibsons

540
00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:45.739
ecological psychologists are wowed by the magic of the brain

541
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.380
. So they don't even want to touch it or

542
00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.289
talk about it. And you've got people like prem

543
00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:51.184
and other people who are like they, I just

544
00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:52.674
think that it doesn't even matter. You could,

545
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:53.824
you could fill, you know, you could just

546
00:30:53.834 --> 00:30:56.535
, you know, scoop out all my brain and

547
00:30:56.545 --> 00:30:57.535
fill it with rubber and it wouldn't make any difference

548
00:30:57.545 --> 00:31:00.743
to my ability to perceive for since, right.

549
00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:03.904
So Gibson, an ecological psychologist had a really hard

550
00:31:03.914 --> 00:31:07.875
time uh with trying to explain things like perception without

551
00:31:07.884 --> 00:31:11.193
doing what everyone else was doing, which was talking

552
00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:15.525
about the brain and talking about complications. So,

553
00:31:15.449 --> 00:31:18.588
um I think that's really important to, to,

554
00:31:18.598 --> 00:31:22.828
to acknowledge that. So, ecological neuroscience was this

555
00:31:22.838 --> 00:31:25.670
attempt to say, hey, we have it as

556
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.318
ecological psychologists really focused on the brain and specifically what

557
00:31:29.328 --> 00:31:32.479
the brain is doing. Um We don't think that

558
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:34.019
it doesn't matter if it's a brain or foam rubber

559
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:36.559
, like no, no brains matter, right?

560
00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:38.989
Brains matter. They're important. Are they computing like

561
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.170
a computer? Are they representing the environment um in

562
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.640
little pictures in the head? And that's how we

563
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.598
control things like action and my ability to grab,

564
00:31:48.608 --> 00:31:51.519
you know, the avoidance of this cup. Is

565
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:53.828
it really about computing and representing? No, it's

566
00:31:53.838 --> 00:31:56.250
not, but the brain is doing something. Let's

567
00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:00.348
see what it's doing. So, ecological psychologists were

568
00:32:00.358 --> 00:32:04.029
interested in trying to see what is the nervous system

569
00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:07.489
activity that is going along with things like hance perception

570
00:32:07.699 --> 00:32:09.029
and that was some of the early kind of ecological

571
00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:14.430
neuroscience work. Um I can leave it at that

572
00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:16.250
for now. Yeah. Sure. So uh I

573
00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:21.719
, I think that we've already covered uh lots of

574
00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:24.500
theoretical and historical background here. Uh I want to

575
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:28.910
get into the main thesis that you develop in your

576
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.108
book. I guess that before that we just need

577
00:32:30.118 --> 00:32:34.769
to talk a little bit about complexity science here.

578
00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:37.750
We've already talked about ecological psychology and neuroscience, how

579
00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:43.338
they relate how they split historically and then also ecology

580
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.930
, neuroscience and traditions in neuroscience. So perhaps uh

581
00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:51.750
that's enough about it if you have something else to

582
00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.469
add about it, please go ahead. But uh

583
00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:58.689
getting into complexity science, I mean, we've already

584
00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:00.088
again, talked a lot about it in our first

585
00:33:00.098 --> 00:33:02.828
interview. So I refer to it again. But

586
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.039
what role does it play in the context of the

587
00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:12.219
thesis you develop in your book? Exactly. Yeah

588
00:33:12.229 --> 00:33:19.078
. So um I think historically, part of the

589
00:33:19.088 --> 00:33:25.969
problem with bringing together ecological psychology and neuroscience is that

590
00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:29.618
they just have very different ways of talking about the

591
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.009
world and they have different methods and different tools that

592
00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:37.469
they use. So my thinking was what if we

593
00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:43.769
start bringing them together by applying a similar kind of

594
00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:49.269
investigative approach. Uh AAA similar set of concepts,

595
00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:52.949
a similar set of methods that both ecological psychologists and

596
00:33:52.959 --> 00:33:57.719
neuroscientists can both agree on and use and maybe that

597
00:33:57.729 --> 00:34:00.949
can be a way to bring them together. So

598
00:34:00.959 --> 00:34:04.549
to that end, um I thought that complexity science

599
00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:08.349
offered those concepts and those tools that are applicable to

600
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.378
the very little. So the neurons in the brain

601
00:34:13.148 --> 00:34:15.599
, to the very big, just an organism acting

602
00:34:15.608 --> 00:34:20.009
in the world. And so um this is not

603
00:34:20.018 --> 00:34:22.989
anything especially unique to me because the fact is that

604
00:34:22.998 --> 00:34:27.599
if you look at the ecological psychology literature and you

605
00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:30.278
look at the neuroscience literature, there are people who

606
00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:34.128
have been trying to pull little bits from complexity science

607
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:38.269
because it's such a broadly applicable set of tools.

608
00:34:38.438 --> 00:34:43.119
So complexity science is um made up of a lot

609
00:34:43.128 --> 00:34:45.750
of sub disciplines. But in short, it tends

610
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.539
to include things like systems theory. Um So the

611
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.239
idea from like cybernetics and things like that of the

612
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.119
importance of feedback loops in systems. Uh It takes

613
00:34:57.128 --> 00:35:00.610
a lot from nonlinear dynamical systems theory. So these

614
00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:04.958
tools that have been developed to capture very complicated um

615
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.519
types of temporal uh behaviors and systems, right?

616
00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.824
And so all these different kinds of of tools have

617
00:35:10.833 --> 00:35:15.155
come together into complexity science to allow you to say

618
00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:17.644
I'm gonna study what the neuron is doing while an

619
00:35:17.655 --> 00:35:21.784
organism is perceiving and afford it. And I can

620
00:35:21.793 --> 00:35:23.724
talk about the neuron and the body and the environment

621
00:35:23.735 --> 00:35:25.954
in very similar ways. I can use very similar

622
00:35:25.965 --> 00:35:29.543
tools. And that's the what the role of complexity

623
00:35:29.554 --> 00:35:34.938
science plays um in my approach. And so tell

624
00:35:34.949 --> 00:35:37.320
us then about what you call in the book,

625
00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:44.079
the next framework that is the neuro ecological nexus theory

626
00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.289
framework. So what is it about? Exactly?

627
00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:52.610
Yeah. So the uh neuro ecological nexus theory is

628
00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:54.989
, you know, my attempt at synthesizing really the

629
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.619
best of ecological psychology, the best of neuroscience and

630
00:35:59.829 --> 00:36:02.809
the tools and concepts from complexity science into a way

631
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.813
in which we can understand the contributions, the nervous

632
00:36:07.824 --> 00:36:09.724
system to the body, to the environment and back

633
00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:15.293
all under one framework. So the uh the neuro

634
00:36:15.304 --> 00:36:19.954
part refers to the importance um of the nervous system

635
00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:22.773
in the brain. The ecological part refers to the

636
00:36:22.784 --> 00:36:27.750
importance of environmental or ecological information. The nexus part

637
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.648
refers to the idea that we have to find some

638
00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:34.199
way to systematically connect, right, there's kind of

639
00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.269
a flow from brains into bodies into the environment.

640
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.070
And back, we have to understand our task of

641
00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:44.000
understanding intelligent behavior and mind is to understand that nexus

642
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.708
that flow between those different uh spatial and temporal scales

643
00:36:47.719 --> 00:36:51.909
. And coming up with a system that makes sense

644
00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:52.469
um that is, is, you know, have

645
00:36:52.478 --> 00:36:55.668
scientific virtues like simplicity and prediction and things like that

646
00:36:57.789 --> 00:37:01.389
. And so um this is a, a theory

647
00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:06.110
um or philosophy if you will about minds, but

648
00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:08.489
it's also supposed to be a scientific research program.

649
00:37:08.909 --> 00:37:13.059
And so, while it has these strong theoretical and

650
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.059
philosophical approaches, you know, stuff from ecological psychology

651
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.648
, complexity theory and things like that, it also

652
00:37:19.659 --> 00:37:25.099
offers testable hypotheses. And so the theory um uh

653
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.239
is, do you want me to get into,

654
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.418
can I explain uh briefly the the different hypotheses?

655
00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:32.539
Y yes, of course. Yes. OK,

656
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.708
great. So um as a testable kind of science

657
00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:40.320
of mind, science of intelligent behavior, um next

658
00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:45.820
offers stick hypotheses which I'll go over briefly. And

659
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:50.050
so the first hypothesis um is that the organism environment

660
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:54.179
system is the privileged spatial temporal scale of description to

661
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:58.800
understand mind. So we wanna understand what mind is

662
00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:01.360
. And I use mine loosely like refer to intelligent

663
00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:05.800
behavior which could include things like perception and action,

664
00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:07.869
but also you know, memory and problem solving if

665
00:38:07.878 --> 00:38:10.429
we wanna understand that really, we have to pay

666
00:38:10.438 --> 00:38:15.889
attention to the real time interactions going on in the

667
00:38:15.898 --> 00:38:19.099
body and the environment. So the environment will always

668
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.648
be constraining the body, the body will always be

669
00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:24.478
kind of constraining the environment. So that's the first

670
00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:30.719
hypothesis. The second hypothesis is that when it comes

671
00:38:30.728 --> 00:38:35.099
to the contributions of the nervous system, the most

672
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.050
significant contributions come from the neuralation dynamic. But when

673
00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:45.239
it comes to understanding coordinative behavior or problem solving really

674
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.628
the action, so to say is coming from neuro

675
00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:51.800
populations. So it's not in single neurons, it's

676
00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:53.909
not in broad regions of the brain, but it's

677
00:38:53.918 --> 00:38:58.648
in the connection of populations of neurons. And so

678
00:38:58.659 --> 00:39:02.570
that's the significant target of population. The third hypothesis

679
00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:08.099
is that those neuro dynamics, uh what is really

680
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:13.639
significant about them is their low dimensional activity. But

681
00:39:13.648 --> 00:39:15.889
there's always gonna be a lot of activity going on

682
00:39:15.898 --> 00:39:19.199
, we'll call that high dimensional activity. But when

683
00:39:19.208 --> 00:39:22.840
we sift through that high dimensional activity, we will

684
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:28.019
zero in on actually a much more sim simple structure

685
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.179
of dynamics that are driving the behavior. So the

686
00:39:31.188 --> 00:39:36.389
third hypothesis is to discover to reveal those low dimensional

687
00:39:36.398 --> 00:39:42.829
dynamics in the nervous system. The fourth hypothesis is

688
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.809
that uh just like the brain of the nervous system

689
00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:52.489
um is most significantly about the low dimensional dynamics.

690
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.969
So too is the body. So the body,

691
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.878
uh this is again, hypothesis for the body is

692
00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:05.139
organized into low-dimensional synergy and so synergies are particular organizations

693
00:40:05.148 --> 00:40:08.320
of the body for purposes of intelligent behavior, for

694
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:10.599
purposes of, you know, swinging a bat and

695
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.219
hitting a ball or dribbling a football, right?

696
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:17.239
The body organizes into certain synergies in order to perform

697
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:22.010
those actions. And those synergies are essentially those low

698
00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:27.478
dimensional um kinds of coordinative aspects of the body.

699
00:40:28.579 --> 00:40:35.208
The fifth hypothesis is that mind again used very broadly

700
00:40:35.688 --> 00:40:39.159
, is it fundamentally emerges at low dimensional scale of

701
00:40:39.168 --> 00:40:44.429
these organism environment activities. So, although there's a

702
00:40:44.438 --> 00:40:47.228
lot of uh neural activity happening all over the place

703
00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:51.300
, although the body is constantly moving, although there's

704
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:53.739
a lot going on in the environment, really intelligent

705
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:58.090
behavior, mind perception problem. So all these things

706
00:40:58.099 --> 00:41:02.938
happen when all of that collapses into low-dimensional uh structures

707
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.128
. And there's a coordinations between the low-dimensional structures of

708
00:41:07.139 --> 00:41:08.789
the brain, the low dimensional structure of the body

709
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.820
and the low dimensional structure of the environment. And

710
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:17.530
that's how we are best poised to understand the brain

711
00:41:17.539 --> 00:41:22.590
body and environment contribution to those activities. And so

712
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:27.059
the final uh hypothesis is that the neuro ecological nexus

713
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:32.000
theory explains those low dimensional structures in terms of a

714
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:37.668
finite set of organizational principles. So there's not gonna

715
00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:42.398
be an infinite set of um rules that guide the

716
00:41:42.409 --> 00:41:44.409
organization of my body, but there will be a

717
00:41:44.418 --> 00:41:46.250
finite set of rules that guide the organization of my

718
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:51.340
body, for example. So things like um critical

719
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:55.269
states, criticality is one kind of rule or principle

720
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.659
that guides a lot of different kinds of organization in

721
00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:01.938
the brain body and environment, essentially to kind of

722
00:42:01.949 --> 00:42:05.063
flesh it out a little bit. A critical state

723
00:42:05.074 --> 00:42:07.375
is when you have uh a lot of high dimensional

724
00:42:07.385 --> 00:42:13.164
activity that gets to a point where uh it is

725
00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:17.715
balanced between disorder and order. So it's organized enough

726
00:42:17.724 --> 00:42:22.184
to maintain a structure, but it's loose enough that

727
00:42:22.195 --> 00:42:23.385
it can adapt. And so we call that that

728
00:42:23.394 --> 00:42:25.695
comes from physics. And this is another key term

729
00:42:25.704 --> 00:42:30.394
in complexity science, a critical state. And so

730
00:42:30.405 --> 00:42:34.050
I think it's likely that neural activity, the body

731
00:42:34.059 --> 00:42:37.639
and the environment, they reach these critical states in

732
00:42:37.648 --> 00:42:42.590
order to achieve uh mind behavior activity and things like

733
00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:45.199
that. And so as hypotheses, I think these

734
00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:47.949
are all empirically testable, I think they all have

735
00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:52.708
to be theoretically reasonable. Um But they can also

736
00:42:52.989 --> 00:42:54.219
all be wrong. Uh If they were, if

737
00:42:54.228 --> 00:42:55.780
it wasn't possible for them to be wrong, it

738
00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:58.458
wouldn't be a science, it would just be a

739
00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:01.369
dogma and that's, that's not fun. Mhm Yeah

740
00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:04.478
, that, that's all great. And by the

741
00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:07.668
way, I have a question saved for later on

742
00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:12.110
in our conversation about the main challenges to your proposal

743
00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:13.820
here. And we can come back to that.

744
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:16.800
But I wanted to ask you at this point specifically

745
00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:21.159
when it comes to those hypothesis that you mentioned there

746
00:43:21.168 --> 00:43:25.708
and looking at the evidence across the different cognitive disciplines

747
00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:30.280
and so on at this point in time, at

748
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:31.829
least, and I hope this is not uh too

749
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.659
unfair of a question to ask at this point because

750
00:43:35.668 --> 00:43:38.849
you're just suggesting this theory in your book. But

751
00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:43.949
at this point in time, uh how much do

752
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:46.250
you think uh uh how much support do you think

753
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:52.378
they have scientifically, not only empirically but also uh

754
00:43:52.389 --> 00:43:58.719
how the uh how accepted they would be theoretically taking

755
00:43:58.728 --> 00:44:02.063
into account our current state of the art in the

756
00:44:02.074 --> 00:44:07.164
cognitive sciences and how much work and what sources of

757
00:44:07.175 --> 00:44:10.684
evidence would we need to draw from? To uh

758
00:44:10.695 --> 00:44:16.344
really demonstrate that it's potentially uh true or correct?

759
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.110
Yeah. So um it is a fair question and

760
00:44:23.478 --> 00:44:30.750
I think in one way, um I think things

761
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.510
are going in my favor and they're going in my

762
00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:37.000
favor because uh I can interpret a lot of research

763
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:43.110
that has been done in ecological psychology in neuroscience through

764
00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:45.639
the lens of a neuro ecological nexus theory. So

765
00:44:45.648 --> 00:44:50.500
I can point out at research on network neuroscience that

766
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.579
looks at critical states, I can look at affordances

767
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:58.010
perception that's been modeled uh as synergies connected to,

768
00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:00.500
you know, self-organization and things like that, right

769
00:45:00.648 --> 00:45:01.260
. So I can, I can pull out these

770
00:45:01.269 --> 00:45:04.039
examples, right? And I can say, oh

771
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.438
, so this is support for hypothesis one, this

772
00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:09.429
is support for this. The hard part though is

773
00:45:09.438 --> 00:45:14.969
um supporting the theory as a whole, right?

774
00:45:15.059 --> 00:45:19.550
So the tough part is gonna be running maybe an

775
00:45:19.559 --> 00:45:22.139
experiment that's gonna hit on all those different levels,

776
00:45:22.148 --> 00:45:25.739
all those different scales and that's gonna be really hard

777
00:45:25.869 --> 00:45:30.648
. So, how would I uh test the neuro

778
00:45:30.789 --> 00:45:34.019
ecological nexus theory? Uh as a whole? Well

779
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.309
, I would, I would have to have a

780
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.519
subject come in. I would have to record from

781
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.090
their brain. I would have to record from their

782
00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:42.260
body. I would have to record the environmental information

783
00:45:42.269 --> 00:45:44.360
. Oh, this is just gonna be a huge

784
00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:46.128
amount of data, right? It's gonna be enormous

785
00:45:46.405 --> 00:45:47.684
. I mean, look at, look at the

786
00:45:47.695 --> 00:45:50.945
brain, all this, you know, brain research

787
00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:52.503
that's been happening the last 10 years. Uh the

788
00:45:52.514 --> 00:45:57.184
brain initiative, the human brain project, they received

789
00:45:57.195 --> 00:46:00.063
billions of dollars uh on the promise that in 10

790
00:46:00.074 --> 00:46:05.250
years they would simulate a whole brain. Well,

791
00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.519
it didn't happen, right? It didn't happen because

792
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:10.559
they started finding things like, well, there's actually

793
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.280
not just a few kinds of neurons in the brain

794
00:46:14.289 --> 00:46:15.539
or a few kinds of cells. It's actually probably

795
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.239
a couple of 1000 different kinds of cells just in

796
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.208
the brain alone. So we might be kind of

797
00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:24.148
worse off than we thought we were. It might

798
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:27.519
be much more complex than we thought it was.

799
00:46:27.648 --> 00:46:29.619
So what we ended up seeing was a lot of

800
00:46:29.628 --> 00:46:32.360
these approaches, they change their goal from, we're

801
00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:37.320
gonna simulate a whole brain to we're gonna develop ways

802
00:46:37.329 --> 00:46:38.760
to record data and share it with each other.

803
00:46:38.978 --> 00:46:42.059
So that's just the first step, right? So

804
00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.889
a way to, to handle all this data and

805
00:46:44.898 --> 00:46:45.780
, and, and making sense of it is gonna

806
00:46:45.789 --> 00:46:50.179
be a very big challenging part and that's just the

807
00:46:50.188 --> 00:46:52.208
brain alone and I wanna come along and say I

808
00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:55.360
wanna do that and the body and the environment,

809
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.860
right? It can be really hard to do,

810
00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:02.659
at least in one kind of um straightforward, simple

811
00:47:02.668 --> 00:47:06.579
setup that's gonna hit on all of those hypotheses.

812
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.739
What I'm gonna end up having to do is do

813
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.438
each one individually and then build up a case and

814
00:47:12.449 --> 00:47:15.039
hopefully motivate that case. But again, each of

815
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.668
the hypotheses are hypotheses and they can be proven wrong

816
00:47:19.679 --> 00:47:22.728
and it would require revising or undermining the whole project

817
00:47:22.889 --> 00:47:27.239
. Um But I think there's a reasonable shot that

818
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.168
the hypotheses will turn out to be supported because there

819
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:31.559
is other work as I point out in the book

820
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:36.360
that supports each of the hypotheses on their own.

821
00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.800
Does that address the, the question? Uh Y

822
00:47:38.969 --> 00:47:42.840
yes, but, but then uh a follow up

823
00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:45.820
to that since you mentioned the human brain project and

824
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:49.458
all of that, uh when it comes to having

825
00:47:49.469 --> 00:47:53.760
a better understanding or ideally a complete understanding of how

826
00:47:53.769 --> 00:47:57.059
our human cognition works, our, how, how

827
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.958
our psychology works. And of course, the human

828
00:48:00.969 --> 00:48:04.739
brain project is or is or was not just simply

829
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:07.079
about cognition or anything like that, it was about

830
00:48:07.532 --> 00:48:12.032
the entirety of the human brain. And so I'm

831
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:16.512
not sure what kinds of claims exactly people were making

832
00:48:16.521 --> 00:48:21.041
about how much of our psychology we could understand through

833
00:48:21.052 --> 00:48:25.083
it. But let's say that your theory is correct

834
00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:30.516
in comparison to something like the human brain project.

835
00:48:30.525 --> 00:48:31.925
If people were to apply it, to have a

836
00:48:31.936 --> 00:48:37.465
full understanding of our cognition, how much better of

837
00:48:37.476 --> 00:48:40.956
a prospect do you think your theory would be in

838
00:48:40.965 --> 00:48:45.215
comparison to just having a complete mapping of the human

839
00:48:45.226 --> 00:48:50.715
brain when it comes to understanding how cognition works?

840
00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:57.869
Yeah. So um I think uh here's my uh

841
00:48:57.878 --> 00:49:00.369
as, as they say, my hot take,

842
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:05.148
um we will not be able to explain most things

843
00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:07.829
. We find interesting about cognition in mind by just

844
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.699
looking at what the brain is doing. The brain

845
00:49:10.708 --> 00:49:14.898
is in some ways. It, it's the most

846
00:49:14.909 --> 00:49:15.539
, you know, people describe it, you know

847
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.389
, in a cliche, it's the most complicated thing

848
00:49:17.398 --> 00:49:21.699
in the universe that we know about. Um But

849
00:49:21.708 --> 00:49:23.750
in, in other ways, it's not that interesting

850
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.869
. It's just made up of cells that are the

851
00:49:25.878 --> 00:49:29.340
same as the cells, you know, in my

852
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:30.688
stomach or on my arm or that used to be

853
00:49:30.699 --> 00:49:34.409
in my hair. Um It, you know,

854
00:49:34.418 --> 00:49:36.648
it's just the same kind of structure of those cells

855
00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:40.168
they communicate um in interesting ways. Uh the communication

856
00:49:40.179 --> 00:49:43.739
, we see that kind of level of communication and

857
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:47.478
things like like beehives and ant colonies uh in cities

858
00:49:47.489 --> 00:49:50.889
and the internet and stuff like that. So,

859
00:49:50.898 --> 00:49:54.119
there's nothing really Irle about it. That's particularly interesting

860
00:49:54.369 --> 00:50:00.250
. Um One of my um colleagues, uh Maor

861
00:50:00.728 --> 00:50:05.530
Mangala, he's a neuroscientist uh uh who's highly influenced

862
00:50:05.539 --> 00:50:07.369
by ecological psychology. And, and he often refers

863
00:50:07.378 --> 00:50:12.050
to one of his colleagues, Damien Kelty Steven,

864
00:50:12.059 --> 00:50:15.489
who describes the brain as a milkshake. And he

865
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.409
says that uh the brain is more like a milkshake

866
00:50:19.418 --> 00:50:22.648
than it is like a computer. Uh milkshakes are

867
00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:25.079
made up of fats and proteins and sugars. Brains

868
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.878
are made up of fats and proteins and sugars.

869
00:50:28.889 --> 00:50:30.659
Uh computers are nothing like that, right? And

870
00:50:30.668 --> 00:50:32.898
the swishing and swirling of, you know, the

871
00:50:32.909 --> 00:50:36.159
activity in the blood and the oxygen and all that

872
00:50:36.168 --> 00:50:37.219
stuff, it's more like a milkshake, right?

873
00:50:37.378 --> 00:50:40.579
And so my hot take is when it comes to

874
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:45.579
understanding um you know, intelligence and memory and creativity

875
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:51.489
and coordinations. Um it's gonna have to include an

876
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.099
understanding of the body, it's gonna have to include

877
00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:58.148
an understanding of body's en environment. Um And I

878
00:50:58.159 --> 00:51:00.918
think that's something that um you know, Gibson was

879
00:51:00.929 --> 00:51:07.039
really focused on. He wasn't necessarily like anti neuroscience

880
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.860
, right? But he was anti uh privileging the

881
00:51:09.869 --> 00:51:12.760
brain that the brain is just, it's like,

882
00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.840
you know, kind of like magic. Oh we

883
00:51:14.849 --> 00:51:15.918
worship the brain, right? And, and,

884
00:51:15.929 --> 00:51:17.320
and it's like we've got the little, you know

885
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:21.079
, your little soul or your little homunculus sitting,

886
00:51:21.128 --> 00:51:22.369
you know, controlling everything and it's like, no

887
00:51:22.378 --> 00:51:23.679
, no, no, that's not happening, right

888
00:51:23.688 --> 00:51:27.349
? The brain is just an organ in the body

889
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.300
that plays a role as the heart plays a role

890
00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:31.369
. Um you know, different things like that.

891
00:51:31.378 --> 00:51:35.958
Um I was very privileged to have um the eminent

892
00:51:35.969 --> 00:51:38.969
neuroscientist, uh Gary Bussi, um who's one of

893
00:51:38.978 --> 00:51:44.809
my heroes in neuroscience. He's um really emphasized,

894
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.969
you know, dynamics and time and, and that

895
00:51:45.978 --> 00:51:49.458
feature of the brain. But he endorsed my book

896
00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:51.208
and, you know, one thing he said was

897
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:52.849
, um we really need to understand the fact that

898
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.208
the brain is just an organ, it's just an

899
00:51:55.219 --> 00:51:59.320
organ in the skull. Um And it, you

900
00:51:59.329 --> 00:52:00.969
know, you have to understand how it's situated in

901
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:02.559
the body. And there's a, a, you

902
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:05.539
know, a, a mutual kind of pathway between

903
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.070
what the body does and the, you know,

904
00:52:07.079 --> 00:52:08.550
the brain does and it's not just about a top

905
00:52:08.628 --> 00:52:14.039
down kind of control. And so I think it's

906
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.728
not my approach, you know, the neuro ecological

907
00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:20.519
nexus theory, I think something along those lines is

908
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.969
gonna have to be true uh to explain even the

909
00:52:22.978 --> 00:52:28.219
most simple of cognitive or mental phenomenon. Um And

910
00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:30.360
one last little bit on, on my tirade,

911
00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:35.969
um a response to your question is we already kind

912
00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:37.728
of know that that project is gonna fail, not

913
00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:43.489
just um practically, right? So it's not like

914
00:52:43.599 --> 00:52:46.760
, OK, uh give us$10 billion over 10

915
00:52:46.769 --> 00:52:50.478
years, we'll simulate a brain. OK? That

916
00:52:50.489 --> 00:52:52.030
didn't happen. Uh So it failed. No,

917
00:52:52.039 --> 00:52:55.489
no, even if it worked, I don't think

918
00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.199
it would have provided the kind of uh explanations or

919
00:53:00.208 --> 00:53:04.929
understanding we want because we've already done it with simpler

920
00:53:04.938 --> 00:53:07.639
organism. So we've basically already done the human brain

921
00:53:07.648 --> 00:53:12.958
project with uh little little tiny organism of the ce

922
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.860
again worm, which only has about, I think

923
00:53:15.869 --> 00:53:19.918
it's like 307 neurons. And I mean, compare

924
00:53:19.929 --> 00:53:21.860
that to humans that have about, you know,

925
00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.809
I don't know what it is. 80 billion,

926
00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:29.628
80 86 billion, I think, yeah, 86

927
00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.639
billion. That's just the neurons, right? So

928
00:53:31.739 --> 00:53:36.070
uh not mentioning the connections and the supporting cells like

929
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.398
glia and stuff like that astrocytes, but we already

930
00:53:38.409 --> 00:53:43.809
know the full mapping and all the connections of a

931
00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.269
seal again and yet we can't predict its movements.

932
00:53:47.469 --> 00:53:51.389
We still don't have an ex full explanation about how

933
00:53:51.398 --> 00:53:53.969
it moves and coordinates its body. That's only 300

934
00:53:53.978 --> 00:53:57.728
neurons. All right. And we can't do it

935
00:53:57.739 --> 00:54:00.978
with that. My thought is we can't do it

936
00:54:00.989 --> 00:54:02.619
with that because it's not just about the neurons,

937
00:54:02.628 --> 00:54:07.458
right? A full explanation of ac elegance, intelligent

938
00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:09.269
behavior is gonna require yes, the neurons, but

939
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.159
also the body and the features of the environment and

940
00:54:14.168 --> 00:54:17.360
that's gonna be just as important. Well, uh

941
00:54:17.369 --> 00:54:22.239
I I guess that things are not looking good for

942
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.579
people who have brain centered approaches, but also not

943
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:30.780
for uh those sort of transhumanists who would want to

944
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:37.099
upload their brains to machines. Yeah, I mean

945
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:37.559
, we can talk about that if you want.

946
00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:39.929
But I mean, my take is that that's not

947
00:54:39.938 --> 00:54:44.349
a real possibility. Um the uploading of, of

948
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.250
the mind um if there is any uploading, it

949
00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:51.739
won't be completely you. Um it may be a

950
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.269
feature of you but, but that's a whole other

951
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.539
interview. I'll have to come back in a few

952
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:58.000
months and then we can talk about transhumanism. Yeah

953
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.478
, I it was just me because II I have

954
00:55:00.489 --> 00:55:04.849
this sort of beef with some friends. You don't

955
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.728
take it too seriously. So, uh OK,

956
00:55:07.739 --> 00:55:09.679
so uh let me just think here. So we

957
00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:14.760
were talking about the ne next uh theory that you

958
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:21.139
presented there and you also explained how it integrates ecological

959
00:55:21.148 --> 00:55:25.099
psychology, neuroscience and so on. So what is

960
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:31.849
the ecological brain then? Really? Yeah. Um

961
00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:34.360
And it's like, as I was writing the book

962
00:55:34.369 --> 00:55:37.039
, I realized I was like already finishing the book

963
00:55:37.519 --> 00:55:38.188
and I said, I don't think I've explained what

964
00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:42.369
I even mean by the title and I think that

965
00:55:42.378 --> 00:55:44.809
happens too often. People have really cool title and

966
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.369
then they, they don't explain it. I'm not

967
00:55:45.378 --> 00:55:47.610
saying mine's a cool title, but I didn't explain

968
00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:51.050
it. Um So in the end, um you

969
00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:52.559
know, II I mentioned it um in the concluding

970
00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.760
chapter, what is the ecological brain? Well,

971
00:55:55.769 --> 00:56:00.340
the ecological brain in short is the idea that a

972
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:04.869
brain is always a part of an ecology, right

973
00:56:04.878 --> 00:56:07.610
? It's not this system, it's not this machine

974
00:56:07.619 --> 00:56:10.469
that you can understand it in isolation. It's not

975
00:56:10.478 --> 00:56:13.889
like I can explain, you know, I have

976
00:56:13.898 --> 00:56:15.309
my, you know, my phone, it's not

977
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.289
like I have my phone and whether I'm sitting here

978
00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:22.599
in a nice temperature controlled room or I sit outside

979
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.369
and it's warm or I go into a, um

980
00:56:24.378 --> 00:56:27.849
, a freezer that's storing meat and, and other

981
00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.510
kinds of foods, but it's still operating the same

982
00:56:30.519 --> 00:56:32.050
way. Right. The ecology doesn't matter really to

983
00:56:32.059 --> 00:56:34.829
my iphone to a certain degree, right? It

984
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.599
gets too hot that it stops working. But,

985
00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:38.418
but the brain is always a part of ecology,

986
00:56:39.199 --> 00:56:43.648
the temperature of the body gravity, all these things

987
00:56:43.659 --> 00:56:46.708
are acting on the brain and the brain is also

988
00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:52.260
contributing to directing what ecology the body will be in

989
00:56:52.519 --> 00:56:55.898
. So if I am feeling really cold, right

990
00:56:55.909 --> 00:56:58.860
? And, and I'm sending information, you know

991
00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:00.878
, across my body into my brain and then my

992
00:57:00.889 --> 00:57:02.039
brain is now, you know, getting oh that

993
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.918
I'm not feeling too good. You know, my

994
00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:06.668
brain might send out signals that says we need to

995
00:57:06.679 --> 00:57:08.050
change the ecology, right? We need to be

996
00:57:08.059 --> 00:57:10.978
in a different environment and those different environments are gonna

997
00:57:10.989 --> 00:57:14.780
affect what it does, right? And I think

998
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:15.769
this is kind of the, you know, the

999
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.489
point that uh Bussi was saying when he, you

1000
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.610
know, you know, endorsed, you know,

1001
00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:22.039
my book is that the brain is always a part

1002
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:23.789
of these ecologies. The brain is not this isolated

1003
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.219
kind of system. And so to understand what the

1004
00:57:27.228 --> 00:57:30.398
brain is doing, we have to understand that it

1005
00:57:30.409 --> 00:57:32.398
is part of that interactive kind of system and,

1006
00:57:32.409 --> 00:57:35.619
and to that and not to beat up on the

1007
00:57:35.628 --> 00:57:38.099
uh transhumanists again. But um and to beat up

1008
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.300
on the human brain project, but that's what's kind

1009
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:44.099
of missing, right? Is this lack of appreciation

1010
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:47.168
of what actually should just be a really simple fact

1011
00:57:47.708 --> 00:57:51.668
, right? Um So in short, what is

1012
00:57:51.679 --> 00:57:53.780
the ecological brain? The ecological brain is the claim

1013
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:59.070
that like every other aspect of organisms, the brain

1014
00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:00.938
too is situated and embedded in a certain kind of

1015
00:58:00.949 --> 00:58:05.579
ecology and that's gonna affect its functioning and what it

1016
00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.820
does. Mhm By the way, I hope this

1017
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:12.449
is not a silly question. But since we're talking

1018
00:58:12.458 --> 00:58:15.860
about ecology here, there's also an approach coming mostly

1019
00:58:15.869 --> 00:58:22.369
from biology, but also nowadays, many anthropologists apply

1020
00:58:22.378 --> 00:58:23.168
it or use it as a framework. There is

1021
00:58:23.579 --> 00:58:28.679
behavioral ecology and then in the context of anthropology,

1022
00:58:28.688 --> 00:58:34.688
human behavioral ecology that is people look at different aspects

1023
00:58:34.699 --> 00:58:38.449
, different factors that differ across different ecologies and then

1024
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:44.688
try to understand uh in terms of our behavioral outputs

1025
00:58:44.699 --> 00:58:49.208
our behavior. Uh if there's regularities in terms of

1026
00:58:49.219 --> 00:58:52.148
, if people are exposed to this or that technological

1027
00:58:52.159 --> 00:58:54.639
factors, uh if there are some tendencies to uh

1028
00:58:54.688 --> 00:59:00.458
develop societies with certain characteristics or they themselves as individuals

1029
00:59:00.469 --> 00:59:06.099
behaving in certain ways, so does uh it connect

1030
00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:09.349
or has any relationship to that in any way because

1031
00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.139
I was trying to understand if, um, that

1032
00:59:13.148 --> 00:59:19.438
aspect of biology could also play a role here or

1033
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.699
not. Yeah. Absolutely. I think it's definitely

1034
00:59:21.708 --> 00:59:23.530
friendly at a minimum. It's friendly to those kinds

1035
00:59:23.539 --> 00:59:27.409
of approaches. Um, what you're talking about as

1036
00:59:27.418 --> 00:59:29.570
well. I think, um, there might be

1037
00:59:29.579 --> 00:59:30.789
some overlap with what I'm talking about, what you're

1038
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.570
talking about and then with something called developmental systems theory

1039
00:59:36.059 --> 00:59:38.119
. And so developmental systems theory is its approach to

1040
00:59:38.128 --> 00:59:42.989
biology and psychology and it's come to influence um even

1041
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.918
things like such as understand the criminal justice system um

1042
00:59:46.168 --> 00:59:49.648
and things like that. But the idea is always

1043
00:59:49.659 --> 00:59:52.969
that it's these whole systems that undergo change and adaptation

1044
00:59:53.449 --> 00:59:58.208
. So it's uh I'm not what you're specifically referring

1045
00:59:58.219 --> 00:59:59.780
to. I don't wanna say what I'm about to

1046
00:59:59.789 --> 00:60:01.219
say, applies to that, but this applies to

1047
00:60:01.228 --> 00:60:05.510
what I'm saying and what the developmental systems theorists say

1048
00:60:06.039 --> 00:60:10.590
they are uh anti reductionist in the sense that um

1049
00:60:10.599 --> 00:60:14.599
it's not just genes, for example, as maybe

1050
00:60:14.610 --> 00:60:16.789
the most reductionist approach to biology, it's not just

1051
00:60:16.800 --> 00:60:21.898
the gene that is uh driving um you know,

1052
00:60:22.269 --> 00:60:24.860
um in organisms, uh th the, and it's

1053
00:60:24.869 --> 00:60:28.289
not just the gene that is being acted on by

1054
00:60:28.300 --> 00:60:31.059
selective pressures, but actually, it's the gene part

1055
00:60:31.070 --> 00:60:35.168
of the organism, part of the environment, that

1056
00:60:35.179 --> 00:60:38.159
whole system is what's being selected for. So,

1057
00:60:38.168 --> 00:60:43.188
for example, um you know, when beavers,

1058
00:60:43.199 --> 00:60:44.820
um you know, they have a certain kind of

1059
00:60:44.829 --> 00:60:47.128
body. They exist in certain kind of environments.

1060
00:60:47.188 --> 00:60:51.949
They build certain kinds of dams, their teeth work

1061
00:60:51.958 --> 00:60:54.208
on both kinds of trees and wood in that area

1062
00:60:54.530 --> 00:60:59.429
. If those beaver families survive, it's because it's

1063
00:60:59.438 --> 00:61:01.219
the whole system that survived. It's the, the

1064
00:61:01.228 --> 00:61:05.599
fur, the tail, the teeth, the wood

1065
00:61:05.610 --> 00:61:07.429
, the water, all of that is a developing

1066
00:61:07.438 --> 00:61:10.789
system over time. And so it wouldn't make sense

1067
00:61:10.800 --> 00:61:13.829
to just focus on what is, what are the

1068
00:61:13.840 --> 00:61:16.719
genes doing, right? Put those same genes,

1069
00:61:16.929 --> 00:61:20.269
you know, in a different body or put those

1070
00:61:20.280 --> 00:61:22.148
beavers in a different environment and they might not be

1071
00:61:22.159 --> 00:61:25.869
selected for or they might be selected for. The

1072
00:61:25.878 --> 00:61:29.269
point is, is that it takes this whole entire

1073
00:61:29.280 --> 00:61:32.090
kind of system to be selected for. Is that

1074
00:61:32.099 --> 00:61:36.239
what you're, does this fit with what this behavioral

1075
00:61:36.250 --> 00:61:38.300
kind of and the anthropological stuff you're talking about?

1076
00:61:38.519 --> 00:61:42.208
Yes. And I guess that perhaps one of the

1077
00:61:42.219 --> 00:61:45.418
things you were alluding to there, I'm not sure

1078
00:61:45.429 --> 00:61:47.929
if directly or not when you mentioned the example of

1079
00:61:47.938 --> 00:61:52.500
the beaver disease, uh niche construction as well or

1080
00:61:52.510 --> 00:61:57.289
not. Yeah, absolutely. Um I think even

1081
00:61:57.300 --> 00:61:59.750
people who were the most, uh and I use

1082
00:61:59.760 --> 00:62:00.489
, you know, scare quotes again, the most

1083
00:62:00.500 --> 00:62:05.780
reductionist about biology, I think even they, um

1084
00:62:06.079 --> 00:62:07.889
, you know, you push them enough and they'll

1085
00:62:07.898 --> 00:62:09.369
say it can't possibly be just the genes. So

1086
00:62:09.378 --> 00:62:13.659
even so Richard Dawkins was one of the big proponents

1087
00:62:13.668 --> 00:62:15.530
of the gene centric approach. He also had a

1088
00:62:15.539 --> 00:62:19.289
book called The Extended Phenotype, right? And he

1089
00:62:19.300 --> 00:62:22.250
talks about how, you know, these behavioral things

1090
00:62:22.260 --> 00:62:23.119
that happen in the world, the use of wood

1091
00:62:23.128 --> 00:62:25.398
and the environment and stuff like that. He'd like

1092
00:62:25.409 --> 00:62:29.099
to frame it in terms of extensions of the genes

1093
00:62:29.719 --> 00:62:30.239
. I would just, I actually, I,

1094
00:62:30.250 --> 00:62:31.820
you know, I'm reading the same thing that he's

1095
00:62:31.829 --> 00:62:34.889
saying and I come to different conclusions. It makes

1096
00:62:34.898 --> 00:62:37.289
me think that gene is less important. But,

1097
00:62:37.300 --> 00:62:42.378
you know, that's uh the biologist. Uh Sure

1098
00:62:42.610 --> 00:62:45.389
. So um I, I mentioned this question earlier

1099
00:62:45.398 --> 00:62:47.938
, but what would you say are perhaps some of

1100
00:62:47.949 --> 00:62:54.849
the main challenges to your ees to your next uh

1101
00:62:54.860 --> 00:63:02.059
framework? Yeah. So there's uh there's challenges across

1102
00:63:02.070 --> 00:63:05.349
the board, right? So, um you know

1103
00:63:05.360 --> 00:63:08.550
, conceptually, right, um when I say mind

1104
00:63:08.559 --> 00:63:10.728
, what do I mean by mind? Um do

1105
00:63:10.739 --> 00:63:14.849
I also mean consciousness, do I just mean problem

1106
00:63:14.860 --> 00:63:17.030
solving? Do I mean perception action, right?

1107
00:63:17.039 --> 00:63:20.458
And these things are all debatable, right? So

1108
00:63:20.760 --> 00:63:24.148
um some people argue that perception of action is not

1109
00:63:24.159 --> 00:63:28.389
mind, right? It's not cognition, it's something

1110
00:63:28.398 --> 00:63:30.750
quite distinct, it's something that's more like me.

1111
00:63:30.760 --> 00:63:32.728
You know, again, I like using these quotes

1112
00:63:32.739 --> 00:63:36.329
. It's more like mere reflex, right? Whereas

1113
00:63:36.340 --> 00:63:38.829
cognition is it allows you to make decisions and intervene

1114
00:63:38.840 --> 00:63:42.418
on mere reflexes. So, so I've, I've

1115
00:63:42.429 --> 00:63:45.039
already got challenges conceptually, right? Method of logically

1116
00:63:45.050 --> 00:63:46.809
, how do I put these things in practice?

1117
00:63:46.820 --> 00:63:49.599
I talked about that a few minutes ago, right

1118
00:63:49.610 --> 00:63:52.070
? If the human brain project with billions of dollars

1119
00:63:52.079 --> 00:63:55.590
in time and thousands of scientists couldn't come up with

1120
00:63:55.599 --> 00:63:59.429
a full simulation of just the brain. How am

1121
00:63:59.438 --> 00:64:02.349
I gonna basically try and do uh an afforded simulation

1122
00:64:02.360 --> 00:64:05.280
from brain body and environment? That's methodologically, that's

1123
00:64:05.289 --> 00:64:11.199
gonna be very challenging and then theoretically right do and

1124
00:64:11.208 --> 00:64:13.398
this overlaps with, you know, concepts as well

1125
00:64:13.409 --> 00:64:17.050
, but are affordances something that need to take the

1126
00:64:17.059 --> 00:64:20.809
nervous system into account? Um Am I missing the

1127
00:64:20.820 --> 00:64:24.179
, the whole point of what Gibson was saying?

1128
00:64:24.360 --> 00:64:25.699
Uh this is, you know, kind of push

1129
00:64:25.708 --> 00:64:28.320
back. I've gotten from some ecological psychologist, right

1130
00:64:28.329 --> 00:64:31.550
. Affordances only exist in the environment and the organism

1131
00:64:31.559 --> 00:64:34.599
and where they meet and if you go too low

1132
00:64:34.610 --> 00:64:36.239
into the brain, then you're missing it. If

1133
00:64:36.250 --> 00:64:39.079
you go too high, then you're out of the

1134
00:64:39.090 --> 00:64:42.398
system, right? That's a theoretical issue. So

1135
00:64:42.409 --> 00:64:45.530
I, I think I am open to being,

1136
00:64:45.539 --> 00:64:47.469
you know, attacked and criticized in those three ways

1137
00:64:47.500 --> 00:64:51.369
. But in particular, I think um I face

1138
00:64:51.378 --> 00:64:55.929
criticisms both from people who I think would be friendly

1139
00:64:56.250 --> 00:65:00.668
um to ecological psychology. But I also faced criticisms

1140
00:65:00.679 --> 00:65:03.360
from people who are against ecological psychology. So people

1141
00:65:03.369 --> 00:65:08.369
who are friendly might be an activist. So an

1142
00:65:08.378 --> 00:65:12.619
active cognition or an activism is um a kind of

1143
00:65:12.628 --> 00:65:15.219
popular approach to understanding what it is to be an

1144
00:65:15.228 --> 00:65:19.340
intelligent living organism. And sometimes there's some overlap with

1145
00:65:19.349 --> 00:65:21.978
what ecological psychologists say, but not always. And

1146
00:65:21.989 --> 00:65:27.739
so there's that approach. Why not do um why

1147
00:65:27.750 --> 00:65:30.639
not call my book, The Inactivate Brain, right

1148
00:65:30.648 --> 00:65:31.619
? They might wanna say that and that they'd say

1149
00:65:31.628 --> 00:65:34.849
that's better than the ecological brain. Maybe I'd have

1150
00:65:34.860 --> 00:65:39.280
to argue with them about that. Right? Then

1151
00:65:39.289 --> 00:65:41.769
I also need to argue against people who are against

1152
00:65:41.780 --> 00:65:46.260
ecological psychology and people who are proponents of computational representational

1153
00:65:46.269 --> 00:65:53.119
approaches, proponents of mechanistic approaches, proponents of reductionism

1154
00:65:53.128 --> 00:65:55.719
, right? My book uh as I say towards

1155
00:65:55.728 --> 00:65:58.010
the end, uh I say something along the lines

1156
00:65:58.019 --> 00:66:01.719
of you might have noticed that I didn't explain anything

1157
00:66:01.728 --> 00:66:06.938
. I didn't describe anything about my approach with computing

1158
00:66:06.949 --> 00:66:11.579
, representing, I didn't describe any mechanisms and I

1159
00:66:11.590 --> 00:66:15.429
didn't reduce anything. And for some people, if

1160
00:66:15.438 --> 00:66:16.329
you miss, if you're missing out on some of

1161
00:66:16.340 --> 00:66:18.739
these and you're just not doing science, right?

1162
00:66:18.750 --> 00:66:23.389
If you're not providing a mechanistic account, whatever that

1163
00:66:23.398 --> 00:66:25.148
is, we could talk about that also. But

1164
00:66:25.159 --> 00:66:26.969
if you're not giving a mechanistic account, then you're

1165
00:66:26.978 --> 00:66:30.659
not giving an explanation. So I'm pushing back,

1166
00:66:30.668 --> 00:66:31.760
it's just, it's a different way of doing science

1167
00:66:31.769 --> 00:66:33.989
also that is pushing back against, you know,

1168
00:66:34.000 --> 00:66:39.728
more reductionist approaches. Um pushing back against mechanistic approaches

1169
00:66:39.739 --> 00:66:41.760
and then pushing back against, you know, the

1170
00:66:41.769 --> 00:66:46.119
apparent richness of the computer metaphor and a representational approaches

1171
00:66:46.329 --> 00:66:47.769
. So I, I've got, I've got,

1172
00:66:48.199 --> 00:66:49.938
I've got a line of people, they, they

1173
00:66:49.949 --> 00:66:51.789
, they're taking their number and they're, they're ready

1174
00:66:51.800 --> 00:66:56.320
to come in and get me. So I have

1175
00:66:56.329 --> 00:66:59.938
two questions. One about one specific thing that you

1176
00:66:59.949 --> 00:67:03.619
mentioned there and a follow up to the challenges here

1177
00:67:03.628 --> 00:67:10.458
. So you mentioned uh mechanistic explanations there and you

1178
00:67:10.625 --> 00:67:15.514
that many people would be dismissive of your framework if

1179
00:67:15.523 --> 00:67:19.273
it doesn't provide, provide them with the mechanistic explanation

1180
00:67:19.284 --> 00:67:25.003
for whatever aspect of human cognition we're studying here.

1181
00:67:25.014 --> 00:67:28.409
I guess. So um I mean, what is

1182
00:67:28.458 --> 00:67:31.829
a mechanistic explanation exactly, particularly for the people who

1183
00:67:31.840 --> 00:67:35.570
might not be familiar with this kind of terminology?

1184
00:67:35.579 --> 00:67:39.898
And what would be, let's say in this case

1185
00:67:39.909 --> 00:67:44.769
, a non mechanistic explanation? Yeah, good,

1186
00:67:44.780 --> 00:67:46.429
good. So this is a very big issue and

1187
00:67:46.438 --> 00:67:50.478
um the philosophy of science. Um And uh I

1188
00:67:50.489 --> 00:67:54.708
actually, I think it's a big issue in science

1189
00:67:54.739 --> 00:67:57.750
, the life science for practicing scientists, they should

1190
00:67:57.760 --> 00:68:00.708
think about this. Um So the mechanistic approach um

1191
00:68:00.719 --> 00:68:06.369
historically goes back to Newton and Descartes where they um

1192
00:68:06.378 --> 00:68:11.260
were thinking about say the solar system as a kind

1193
00:68:11.269 --> 00:68:14.500
of machine, right? Uh planets that are kind

1194
00:68:14.510 --> 00:68:15.208
of, you know, moving around in a certain

1195
00:68:15.220 --> 00:68:17.140
way, right? Almost like pivoting on a kind

1196
00:68:17.149 --> 00:68:19.890
of central piece which is the sun. Uh And

1197
00:68:19.899 --> 00:68:24.149
then the body of des Cartes who's famous for his

1198
00:68:24.159 --> 00:68:26.930
dualism, his mind, body, dualism. He

1199
00:68:26.939 --> 00:68:29.918
still was a great anatomist and he spent a lot

1200
00:68:29.930 --> 00:68:31.220
of his time studying the structures of the body and

1201
00:68:31.229 --> 00:68:33.520
he thought the body was very much like a like

1202
00:68:33.529 --> 00:68:36.259
a mechanical system. So for example, uh if

1203
00:68:36.270 --> 00:68:38.759
I had my hand, if I were to open

1204
00:68:38.770 --> 00:68:42.109
up my forearm, you'd see all these like tendons

1205
00:68:42.119 --> 00:68:43.369
. And if I were to pull one, my

1206
00:68:43.378 --> 00:68:45.329
finger would move, right? He said this is

1207
00:68:45.338 --> 00:68:46.399
like it's a machine, right? We are living

1208
00:68:46.409 --> 00:68:51.720
machines, fast forward a few 100 years. And

1209
00:68:51.939 --> 00:68:56.369
um the mechanistic approach in the late nineties, early

1210
00:68:56.378 --> 00:69:00.289
two thousands in the philosophy of science, there was

1211
00:69:00.298 --> 00:69:02.899
a group of philosophers who said, what do scientists

1212
00:69:02.909 --> 00:69:06.000
do when they try to explain something in the life

1213
00:69:06.009 --> 00:69:09.779
sciences, when they're trying to explain a cell or

1214
00:69:09.789 --> 00:69:12.588
an organism or an environment or something like that,

1215
00:69:12.600 --> 00:69:15.619
how do they explain digestion or memory or whatever?

1216
00:69:15.649 --> 00:69:16.079
And these, and these people said, well,

1217
00:69:16.088 --> 00:69:18.298
what they do is they, they try to isolate

1218
00:69:19.019 --> 00:69:21.618
as much as possible, their target, they try

1219
00:69:21.627 --> 00:69:25.278
to break it apart, they try to understand the

1220
00:69:25.288 --> 00:69:28.667
contributions of the parts and then they try to understand

1221
00:69:28.909 --> 00:69:30.640
what they do together. And so you have a

1222
00:69:30.649 --> 00:69:34.088
mechanism when you can say this is the phenomenon,

1223
00:69:34.430 --> 00:69:36.789
be it, you know, memory like long term

1224
00:69:36.798 --> 00:69:41.659
potentiation or digestion or whatever. And here's the starting

1225
00:69:41.668 --> 00:69:44.600
point, here's what each of the parts do.

1226
00:69:44.609 --> 00:69:46.189
And here's the ending point. Now you got a

1227
00:69:46.199 --> 00:69:49.310
memory. Now you have digested food. Now you

1228
00:69:49.319 --> 00:69:53.430
have a new baby, right? Um And so

1229
00:69:53.439 --> 00:69:55.489
this was, this is a very general sense in

1230
00:69:55.500 --> 00:69:59.810
which you have a mechanism. The problem that the

1231
00:69:59.819 --> 00:70:05.140
mechanist quickly um realized was you can't always break things

1232
00:70:05.149 --> 00:70:11.088
apart and give an understanding of them outside of their

1233
00:70:11.100 --> 00:70:13.779
context, right? If you have say, um

1234
00:70:14.418 --> 00:70:16.399
, you know, uh a toilet and the toilet

1235
00:70:16.409 --> 00:70:20.399
has, you know, a handle and the handle

1236
00:70:20.409 --> 00:70:23.628
lifts, the little thing on the inside which lets

1237
00:70:23.640 --> 00:70:25.789
the water run. And if you wanna unders,

1238
00:70:25.850 --> 00:70:28.270
if you want to describe the mechanism of how a

1239
00:70:28.279 --> 00:70:31.140
toilet flushes that handle is always just a handle,

1240
00:70:31.180 --> 00:70:34.000
that flapper is always just a flapper. The seat

1241
00:70:34.009 --> 00:70:36.720
is always just a seat and you just add them

1242
00:70:36.729 --> 00:70:42.600
together. But pretty much most things actually in nature

1243
00:70:42.609 --> 00:70:45.979
are not like that, pretty much things always require

1244
00:70:45.989 --> 00:70:51.569
a context and their capacities require the situation, understanding

1245
00:70:51.579 --> 00:70:56.409
the situation that they're in. And so this mechanistic

1246
00:70:56.418 --> 00:71:00.829
approach um had some problems and required some modification.

1247
00:71:01.088 --> 00:71:05.789
So people started including descriptions of things as being decomposable

1248
00:71:05.798 --> 00:71:11.128
. So coming apart uh non decomposable. So systems

1249
00:71:11.140 --> 00:71:14.729
that um only work when they are a complete whole

1250
00:71:14.779 --> 00:71:17.378
and then you also have descriptions of nearly decomposable systems

1251
00:71:17.390 --> 00:71:19.409
. So systems where you could kind of maybe get

1252
00:71:19.418 --> 00:71:23.069
an idea of what the parts are contributing. Uh

1253
00:71:23.079 --> 00:71:25.739
you know, things like that. This has been

1254
00:71:25.750 --> 00:71:30.109
of the most popular um way of understanding explanation in

1255
00:71:30.119 --> 00:71:31.310
the life sciences and philosophy of science. And it

1256
00:71:31.319 --> 00:71:33.829
, it I think it tracks well with what scientists

1257
00:71:33.838 --> 00:71:39.079
, especially like neuroscientists and biologists are doing. So

1258
00:71:39.088 --> 00:71:42.020
what would be a non mechanistic approach? Well,

1259
00:71:42.029 --> 00:71:45.838
a non mes mechanistic approach to explanation could be something

1260
00:71:45.850 --> 00:71:51.930
like a mathematical description. Um Einstein's equation uh Newton's

1261
00:71:51.939 --> 00:71:57.250
um differential equations of the solar system, these types

1262
00:71:57.259 --> 00:72:00.329
of things are not mechanistic, they have variables in

1263
00:72:00.338 --> 00:72:03.109
the equations that refer to real things in the world

1264
00:72:03.579 --> 00:72:05.739
. But when you are trying to understand how those

1265
00:72:05.750 --> 00:72:09.739
things interact, you're paying more attention to the relationship

1266
00:72:09.750 --> 00:72:13.628
of variables than you are as opposed to the specifics

1267
00:72:14.020 --> 00:72:15.199
. Uh So you kind of, you're abstracting away

1268
00:72:15.359 --> 00:72:17.489
a bit. Uh So that's one example of a

1269
00:72:17.500 --> 00:72:25.470
non mechanistic um approach. Um Yeah. Do,

1270
00:72:25.659 --> 00:72:28.918
do you think that in this particular case, if

1271
00:72:28.930 --> 00:72:32.329
we would have a mathematical explanation, perhaps one of

1272
00:72:32.338 --> 00:72:38.390
the reasons why maybe I don't know, psychologists and

1273
00:72:38.399 --> 00:72:42.588
neuroscience, neuroscientists, uh I mean, at least

1274
00:72:42.600 --> 00:72:47.229
a big number of them wouldn't be too fond of

1275
00:72:47.239 --> 00:72:53.689
uh an approach based also on complexity theory because I

1276
00:72:53.699 --> 00:72:57.548
don't know, perhaps the mathematics there is a little

1277
00:72:57.560 --> 00:73:00.628
bit too complicated for most people. I mean,

1278
00:73:00.640 --> 00:73:03.069
I, I'm not trying to claim that pe people

1279
00:73:03.079 --> 00:73:05.689
from those disciplines can't learn it. It's just that

1280
00:73:05.699 --> 00:73:11.579
perhaps they are not used to that level of mathematics

1281
00:73:11.588 --> 00:73:13.869
. I don't know, I think it's an excellent

1282
00:73:13.878 --> 00:73:16.189
point. Um And, and I think, you

1283
00:73:16.199 --> 00:73:19.259
know, now we're, now we're psychologizing our scientists

1284
00:73:19.270 --> 00:73:20.579
, right? We're trying to, and this might

1285
00:73:20.588 --> 00:73:24.628
require um its own kind of study, right?

1286
00:73:24.640 --> 00:73:26.979
The nature of, of, of scientists and what

1287
00:73:26.989 --> 00:73:29.838
they, they prefer, you know, we could

1288
00:73:29.850 --> 00:73:32.859
say again, broadly speaking, um people go into

1289
00:73:32.869 --> 00:73:36.918
physics because they want to understand the general principles of

1290
00:73:36.930 --> 00:73:41.628
how things are organized, right? They wanna understand

1291
00:73:41.640 --> 00:73:44.579
um you know, entropy, you know, of

1292
00:73:44.588 --> 00:73:45.859
, of, of the particles in a container.

1293
00:73:45.869 --> 00:73:48.180
But they don't really care about the specific particle.

1294
00:73:48.548 --> 00:73:51.489
But someone might be interested in doing chemistry because they

1295
00:73:51.500 --> 00:73:55.569
care about the specific chemical structure, but they care

1296
00:73:55.579 --> 00:73:59.720
about biology because they care about identifying the specific cells

1297
00:73:59.729 --> 00:74:01.449
and the organs and how those things come together.

1298
00:74:01.539 --> 00:74:03.979
And so there might be a tension here where someone

1299
00:74:03.989 --> 00:74:06.310
who's more, you know, quote unquote physics minded

1300
00:74:06.319 --> 00:74:09.369
might say, oh, you biologist, you care

1301
00:74:09.378 --> 00:74:11.583
about all those methods, details. But what are

1302
00:74:11.595 --> 00:74:14.645
you really telling us? That's interesting. Similarly,

1303
00:74:14.654 --> 00:74:15.664
the biologists you know, might be looking at the

1304
00:74:15.673 --> 00:74:17.884
physicist and saying all you're giving me is all this

1305
00:74:17.895 --> 00:74:20.194
crazy math and you haven't really told me how anything

1306
00:74:20.204 --> 00:74:24.864
actually worked, right? It's like taking a car

1307
00:74:24.875 --> 00:74:27.664
, right? Do we wanna understand how combustion works

1308
00:74:27.673 --> 00:74:29.904
or do we want to understand how the parts fit

1309
00:74:29.914 --> 00:74:32.509
together? Well, I think these are different kinds

1310
00:74:32.520 --> 00:74:38.579
of temperament, but my bet is that when it

1311
00:74:38.588 --> 00:74:42.439
comes to understanding mind, cognition, perception, memory

1312
00:74:42.449 --> 00:74:44.168
, all this kind of stuff, right? That

1313
00:74:44.180 --> 00:74:48.909
these emerge, these these properties, these abilities emerge

1314
00:74:48.918 --> 00:74:55.829
from highly complex systems, highly complicated systems with many

1315
00:74:55.838 --> 00:75:00.390
degrees of freedom, right? And keeping track of

1316
00:75:00.399 --> 00:75:02.939
all those is gonna be really difficult. And in

1317
00:75:02.949 --> 00:75:04.829
that sense, I think going the more kind of

1318
00:75:04.838 --> 00:75:08.569
physics route where you don't care about the location of

1319
00:75:08.579 --> 00:75:11.640
every particle inside the container, but you care about

1320
00:75:11.649 --> 00:75:15.569
general kind of patterns of behavior. I think that's

1321
00:75:15.579 --> 00:75:19.729
gonna give us more scientific virtue like uh manipulation,

1322
00:75:19.739 --> 00:75:26.509
prediction, things like that with that sound is the

1323
00:75:26.520 --> 00:75:30.189
physics approach gonna develop any medication. Is the physics

1324
00:75:30.199 --> 00:75:32.668
approach gonna help, you know, cure cancer?

1325
00:75:33.220 --> 00:75:35.668
II, I think it could contribute to it.

1326
00:75:35.909 --> 00:75:38.649
But I think in, in that way, the

1327
00:75:38.659 --> 00:75:40.449
kind of, you know, medical approach, the

1328
00:75:40.458 --> 00:75:44.128
anatomical approach, I think that's gonna benefit uh from

1329
00:75:44.140 --> 00:75:47.458
having someone who's more uh biological mechanistic minded, who

1330
00:75:47.470 --> 00:75:50.909
wants to focus on the the wet sticky detail,

1331
00:75:51.128 --> 00:75:55.109
right? But as we're seeing, I think there's

1332
00:75:55.119 --> 00:75:57.390
, you know, a co evolution of the two

1333
00:75:58.119 --> 00:76:00.560
to help us understand mine, it's gonna take both

1334
00:76:00.569 --> 00:76:02.708
approaches, but I lean towards my intuition is that

1335
00:76:02.720 --> 00:76:05.579
it leans more towards the physics kinds of stuff.

1336
00:76:06.640 --> 00:76:10.668
So let me ask you one last question then still

1337
00:76:10.680 --> 00:76:14.560
related to the challenges to your proposal. Because I

1338
00:76:14.569 --> 00:76:16.609
mean, I guess that one of the main things

1339
00:76:16.619 --> 00:76:19.509
that you pointed to here is the fact that you

1340
00:76:19.520 --> 00:76:24.659
would have to convince many different kinds of people from

1341
00:76:24.668 --> 00:76:28.884
the different disciplines, different theoretical frameworks and so on

1342
00:76:28.895 --> 00:76:30.265
. So do you think that perhaps one of the

1343
00:76:30.274 --> 00:76:34.134
challenges here and it, it's not only to your

1344
00:76:34.185 --> 00:76:40.435
framework or to convincing other people that potentially your framework

1345
00:76:40.444 --> 00:76:44.798
is correct, but also perhaps a broader question that

1346
00:76:44.810 --> 00:76:48.750
applies to the to your book in general also to

1347
00:76:48.759 --> 00:76:54.979
perhaps understanding why it is that different disciplines, even

1348
00:76:54.989 --> 00:76:59.989
though they might be focusing on similar objects of study

1349
00:77:00.000 --> 00:77:03.350
might diverge so much historically. Do you think that

1350
00:77:03.442 --> 00:77:08.143
has anything to do with how difficult it is to

1351
00:77:08.453 --> 00:77:15.262
have interdisciplinary in academia and the university context? Because

1352
00:77:15.271 --> 00:77:19.061
people are trained in specific areas, specific domains with

1353
00:77:19.073 --> 00:77:24.131
specific theoretical approaches, methodologies and so on. And

1354
00:77:24.143 --> 00:77:26.875
of course, then they have their careers and it's

1355
00:77:26.886 --> 00:77:30.055
based on the kinds of things they have been working

1356
00:77:30.064 --> 00:77:32.694
with the frameworks they have been applying. And of

1357
00:77:32.706 --> 00:77:38.104
course, it's also uh many times extremely difficult for

1358
00:77:38.115 --> 00:77:44.375
people to acquire enough knowledge, enough competence about other

1359
00:77:44.386 --> 00:77:46.935
disciplines and methodologies and frameworks. So do you think

1360
00:77:46.944 --> 00:77:51.539
that perhaps uh in the context of your book in

1361
00:77:51.548 --> 00:77:57.029
general? Um this is uh something that we need

1362
00:77:57.039 --> 00:77:59.699
, we need to take into account and perhaps presents

1363
00:77:59.708 --> 00:78:03.489
a big obstacle here. I think it's an excellent

1364
00:78:03.500 --> 00:78:06.088
point. Um I wish I had asked you to

1365
00:78:06.100 --> 00:78:10.899
ask me this question because it, it's it,

1366
00:78:10.909 --> 00:78:14.878
it is such an excellent point. Um You know

1367
00:78:14.890 --> 00:78:16.569
, the, the way that yeah, the way

1368
00:78:16.579 --> 00:78:20.958
that knowledge acquisition happens, um you know, in

1369
00:78:20.970 --> 00:78:25.000
, in our systems and our culture is to have

1370
00:78:25.009 --> 00:78:26.810
this kind of, you know, siloed, you

1371
00:78:26.819 --> 00:78:28.119
know, discipline, you have a, you know

1372
00:78:28.128 --> 00:78:30.020
, you have your Department of Physics, your Department

1373
00:78:30.029 --> 00:78:30.609
of Chemistry, you know, et cetera, et

1374
00:78:30.619 --> 00:78:34.810
cetera, et cetera. Um And for good reason

1375
00:78:34.819 --> 00:78:38.449
, right. Because you can only do so much

1376
00:78:38.458 --> 00:78:39.609
. So, I'm, I'm kind of repeating a

1377
00:78:39.619 --> 00:78:41.369
little bit what you're saying in agreement, right?

1378
00:78:41.409 --> 00:78:42.779
You can only get, you know, you get

1379
00:78:42.789 --> 00:78:45.069
your ph getting one phd is hard enough, right

1380
00:78:45.079 --> 00:78:47.208
? And then getting good at it is a whole

1381
00:78:47.220 --> 00:78:50.520
other level, right? And making contributions and pushing

1382
00:78:50.529 --> 00:78:53.989
the field forward, whatever the field it is,

1383
00:78:54.000 --> 00:78:57.100
it's literature, history, economics, physics, right

1384
00:78:57.109 --> 00:78:59.649
. Getting good enough because there's so we know so

1385
00:78:59.659 --> 00:79:01.180
much, we have so much information that we have

1386
00:79:01.189 --> 00:79:05.109
to deal with just within one discipline alone. Um

1387
00:79:06.208 --> 00:79:11.529
How are we supposed to engage with these really complicated

1388
00:79:11.539 --> 00:79:15.838
difficult topics like mine, cognition, intelligence. Well

1389
00:79:15.899 --> 00:79:18.479
, one thing is to say um the discipline that

1390
00:79:18.489 --> 00:79:23.319
I do, that's the right discipline and right.

1391
00:79:23.329 --> 00:79:27.009
So I'm a neuroscientist and I care about biochemistry and

1392
00:79:27.020 --> 00:79:28.699
that's how you're gonna do it, right? That's

1393
00:79:28.708 --> 00:79:31.009
one way to approach it. And you say everyone

1394
00:79:31.020 --> 00:79:33.119
else is wrong, another way to approach it is

1395
00:79:33.128 --> 00:79:35.659
to say I'm a neuroscientist. I care about the

1396
00:79:35.668 --> 00:79:39.970
biochemistry, but I know I need to talk to

1397
00:79:39.979 --> 00:79:42.369
other people who do other things and I need to

1398
00:79:42.378 --> 00:79:44.918
make connections and you know, to see how we

1399
00:79:44.930 --> 00:79:48.079
connect in that way to give a more complete account

1400
00:79:48.088 --> 00:79:50.619
, more complete explanation. But when is that supposed

1401
00:79:50.628 --> 00:79:54.720
to happen? When does that conversation happen? Not

1402
00:79:54.729 --> 00:79:57.529
in the journals? Right? In the journals,

1403
00:79:57.539 --> 00:80:00.529
they just publish very specific kind of issues, right

1404
00:80:00.539 --> 00:80:02.680
? Very very limited, right? You look at

1405
00:80:02.689 --> 00:80:04.750
a neuroscience journal and they, they say, well

1406
00:80:04.759 --> 00:80:08.310
, we are now looking at molecule X that's an

1407
00:80:08.319 --> 00:80:11.680
AX on receptor 32. And this, and I

1408
00:80:11.689 --> 00:80:14.069
spend my whole career, you know, doing that

1409
00:80:14.079 --> 00:80:15.600
. Well, what does that have to do with

1410
00:80:15.609 --> 00:80:17.189
cognition? If anything? Right? I, I

1411
00:80:17.199 --> 00:80:20.048
don't know, but someone needs to be talking about

1412
00:80:20.060 --> 00:80:21.909
this. Uh and, and, and trying to

1413
00:80:21.918 --> 00:80:29.220
bring these things together, the establishment um doesn't reward

1414
00:80:29.229 --> 00:80:30.949
that kind of work, right? Whenever you publish

1415
00:80:30.958 --> 00:80:33.668
in the top journals, you're usually very focused.

1416
00:80:33.789 --> 00:80:36.149
When you get grant money, it's to, to

1417
00:80:36.159 --> 00:80:41.569
look at very specific kinds of issues where you already

1418
00:80:41.579 --> 00:80:44.390
kind of know how the problem is gonna be solved

1419
00:80:44.539 --> 00:80:45.250
. You kind of, you end up especially in

1420
00:80:45.259 --> 00:80:48.529
the US institutions with, with grant funding, you

1421
00:80:48.539 --> 00:80:51.100
kind of have to already have succeeded in your project

1422
00:80:51.109 --> 00:80:54.819
in order to get the money. Um and,

1423
00:80:54.829 --> 00:80:57.159
and, and so where's the risk and where's the

1424
00:80:57.168 --> 00:81:00.149
interdisciplinary when it's other people who are very specific and

1425
00:81:00.159 --> 00:81:02.899
focused, who are making the the decisions about whether

1426
00:81:02.909 --> 00:81:05.958
your grant gets funded or your paper gets published.

1427
00:81:06.039 --> 00:81:11.489
So the system itself makes it very difficult to um

1428
00:81:11.668 --> 00:81:15.270
embrace these multi scale kinds of approaches. Um As

1429
00:81:15.279 --> 00:81:18.319
I think my approach is, I think sometimes this

1430
00:81:18.329 --> 00:81:21.958
is the luxury of being a philosopher is um I

1431
00:81:21.970 --> 00:81:24.399
get to kind of, you know, I get

1432
00:81:24.409 --> 00:81:26.689
, I get to dabble in these different areas,

1433
00:81:26.699 --> 00:81:30.060
right? Um But I also thought at least personally

1434
00:81:30.069 --> 00:81:32.500
, if I want to explain or at least engage

1435
00:81:32.509 --> 00:81:35.539
with the sciences of the things I'm interested in like

1436
00:81:35.548 --> 00:81:39.399
cognition or intelligence, I think I should have had

1437
00:81:39.409 --> 00:81:43.659
some training to see what these scientists do. And

1438
00:81:43.668 --> 00:81:45.539
so I have, I have training in experimental psychology

1439
00:81:45.548 --> 00:81:49.869
and neuroscience because I wanted to see kind of what

1440
00:81:49.878 --> 00:81:51.628
the philosophers are saying. And if it makes any

1441
00:81:51.640 --> 00:81:54.770
sense, I wanted to see what the neuroscientists are

1442
00:81:54.779 --> 00:81:57.159
doing that the philosophers are right or wrong about,

1443
00:81:57.378 --> 00:82:00.430
but it's been really hard to do. Um And

1444
00:82:00.439 --> 00:82:03.829
not everyone wants to do that. Um nor should

1445
00:82:03.838 --> 00:82:06.548
they uh you end up getting more successful if you

1446
00:82:06.560 --> 00:82:09.939
focus on a limited range of things and get really

1447
00:82:09.949 --> 00:82:12.628
good at that. So, yeah, I think

1448
00:82:12.640 --> 00:82:15.430
interdisciplinary, I think um the way the system is

1449
00:82:15.439 --> 00:82:18.878
set up of reward in academia and things like that

1450
00:82:19.529 --> 00:82:25.229
, I think that's definitely poses a challenge to providing

1451
00:82:25.239 --> 00:82:30.918
a multidisciplinary multis scale account of very complicated phenomenon.

1452
00:82:30.359 --> 00:82:32.958
Mhm You know, one of the reasons why I

1453
00:82:32.970 --> 00:82:35.458
asked you that question is that, I mean,

1454
00:82:35.470 --> 00:82:41.699
perhaps uh I have a privileged position because I'm able

1455
00:82:41.708 --> 00:82:44.539
to do this full time. And I talk,

1456
00:82:44.548 --> 00:82:46.079
I get to talk with people from many, many

1457
00:82:46.088 --> 00:82:51.500
different disciplines, mostly the psychological, behavioral evolutionary sciences

1458
00:82:51.509 --> 00:82:56.173
, but also from other areas. And I mean

1459
00:82:56.503 --> 00:83:00.875
, I understand it's perfectly understandable that people of course

1460
00:83:00.884 --> 00:83:03.333
cannot learn all of these and neither can I,

1461
00:83:03.345 --> 00:83:08.253
I mean, I only know tiny bits of uh

1462
00:83:08.265 --> 00:83:11.265
everything, let's say. But, um, I

1463
00:83:11.274 --> 00:83:14.293
mean, it's perfectly understandable. But on the other

1464
00:83:14.305 --> 00:83:17.494
hand, sometimes I see a lot of people from

1465
00:83:17.503 --> 00:83:23.609
this different disciplines dealing with the same subjects talking past

1466
00:83:23.619 --> 00:83:28.609
each other just because they are not versed on what

1467
00:83:28.619 --> 00:83:30.430
the other people, what the other person is working

1468
00:83:30.439 --> 00:83:33.369
on. The kinds of theoretical approaches. They have

1469
00:83:33.378 --> 00:83:39.208
the kinds of methodologies, they apply uh concepts and

1470
00:83:39.220 --> 00:83:42.189
so on and, and, and sometimes it's really

1471
00:83:42.199 --> 00:83:45.414
, it, it can become really frustrating to see

1472
00:83:45.423 --> 00:83:49.634
that perhaps people are clinging so much to their own

1473
00:83:49.854 --> 00:83:54.753
. I don't know, pet theories or pet methodologies

1474
00:83:54.765 --> 00:84:00.435
or their own uh preferred frameworks. And just very

1475
00:84:00.685 --> 00:84:02.095
, and perhaps this is the part that frustrates me

1476
00:84:02.104 --> 00:84:09.750
the most just easily dismiss uh some other things that

1477
00:84:09.759 --> 00:84:13.270
or, or other approaches that other people have and

1478
00:84:13.539 --> 00:84:17.069
many times it's because they don't even have a good

1479
00:84:17.079 --> 00:84:21.100
enough understanding of what the, the other people are

1480
00:84:21.109 --> 00:84:26.470
coming from because again, they don't have enough knowledge

1481
00:84:26.479 --> 00:84:27.829
about it. I mean, ii, I don't

1482
00:84:27.838 --> 00:84:30.039
know if you agree with what I'm saying here or

1483
00:84:30.048 --> 00:84:32.369
if you, we and the criticisms of it.

1484
00:84:32.859 --> 00:84:34.989
No, I agree. And I'll take you one

1485
00:84:35.000 --> 00:84:39.329
step further and here's another hot take. I think

1486
00:84:39.338 --> 00:84:43.829
a lot of scientists um don't even really understand the

1487
00:84:43.838 --> 00:84:46.770
commitments of their own discipline. And I say that

1488
00:84:46.779 --> 00:84:48.470
as a matter of fact, not as a value

1489
00:84:48.479 --> 00:84:54.199
judgment because there is no need to question uh the

1490
00:84:54.208 --> 00:84:57.668
commitments, right? Um So Thomas Coon, uh

1491
00:84:57.680 --> 00:85:00.649
historian, philosopher of science, he talks about normal

1492
00:85:00.659 --> 00:85:04.039
science. Normal Science is when you have a community

1493
00:85:04.048 --> 00:85:08.399
of people who speak the same language, right?

1494
00:85:08.409 --> 00:85:10.250
So maybe we'll take a biologist, they kind of

1495
00:85:10.259 --> 00:85:12.970
understand what a gene is, what a cell is

1496
00:85:12.979 --> 00:85:14.859
. Uh They have shared methods like, you know

1497
00:85:14.869 --> 00:85:17.909
, basic statistical analysis. They all understand that they

1498
00:85:17.918 --> 00:85:20.569
all, you know, read the same journals,

1499
00:85:20.579 --> 00:85:24.899
they all um teach the same textbooks, right?

1500
00:85:24.909 --> 00:85:27.399
They all have an idea of what experiments should look

1501
00:85:27.409 --> 00:85:29.548
like and what an answer should look like. And

1502
00:85:29.560 --> 00:85:30.890
this is just normal everyday kind of science. They

1503
00:85:30.899 --> 00:85:35.213
don't have to question whether a gene really is exist

1504
00:85:35.354 --> 00:85:38.604
or whether, you know, what is a spell

1505
00:85:38.614 --> 00:85:41.024
or what, you know, are these statistical methods

1506
00:85:41.034 --> 00:85:44.384
found? They don't have to uh and they probably

1507
00:85:44.524 --> 00:85:45.604
as a discipline would be worse off if they paid

1508
00:85:45.614 --> 00:85:47.664
attention to that, they can make a lot of

1509
00:85:47.673 --> 00:85:53.279
progress by just accepting the paradigm, right? The

1510
00:85:53.289 --> 00:85:56.239
problem though is when you start hitting, you know

1511
00:85:56.250 --> 00:85:58.119
, at least what Thomas Coon said, you start

1512
00:85:58.128 --> 00:86:00.489
hitting anomalies like, right? Too many things that

1513
00:86:00.500 --> 00:86:02.628
you can't explain or when things get too messy,

1514
00:86:02.729 --> 00:86:08.069
that's when scientists are questioning their paradigm. And so

1515
00:86:08.079 --> 00:86:12.449
I totally understand and I totally respect uh the,

1516
00:86:12.458 --> 00:86:15.628
the day to day scientist who doesn't have to question

1517
00:86:15.640 --> 00:86:17.009
the foundation and they don't have to pay attention to

1518
00:86:17.020 --> 00:86:23.918
anybody else. Um But if you have that,

1519
00:86:23.930 --> 00:86:26.859
that tendency, if you have that personality, that

1520
00:86:26.869 --> 00:86:30.949
questions things, um it's very easy to find what

1521
00:86:30.958 --> 00:86:34.619
people don't know about even their own discipline. OK

1522
00:86:34.628 --> 00:86:38.319
, great. So perhaps this is a good point

1523
00:86:38.329 --> 00:86:41.180
to wrap up the interview. And the book is

1524
00:86:41.189 --> 00:86:44.939
again the ecological brain unifying the sciences of brain,

1525
00:86:44.949 --> 00:86:46.869
body and environment. I'm leaving a link to it

1526
00:86:46.878 --> 00:86:49.439
in the description box of the interview. And Doctor

1527
00:86:49.449 --> 00:86:53.060
Favela, apart from the book, would you like

1528
00:86:53.069 --> 00:86:55.418
to tell people again, where can, where they

1529
00:86:55.430 --> 00:86:57.939
can find you and your work on the internet?

1530
