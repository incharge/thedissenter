00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.068
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.889
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.089
And today I'm joined by Doctor Leo Papa. She

4
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.210
is a tendered researcher at the Institute of Science,

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.414
Cognitive Mac uh Jan of the San Nacional de La

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.504
Research Scientific in France and principal investigator of the research

7
00:00:22.513 --> 00:00:26.454
program, the Temple funded by a European Research Council

8
00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:32.365
starting grant. And today we're talking about social perception

9
00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:35.793
, basically what we pay attention to in other people

10
00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:40.173
and their interactions and the social information we get from

11
00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.594
that. So, Doctor Pao, welcome to the

12
00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:45.618
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone. Thanks

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.548
for having me. So when it comes to how

14
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.728
we perceive other people, what are the kinds of

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.240
things we usually pay attention to? So um attention

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.439
depends on um a number of things, depends on

17
00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:10.120
the salience of the stimuli. So how salient the

18
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:11.930
stimuli are to our eyes. So for instance,

19
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.513
a bright red object is going to attract our attention

20
00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:23.234
more than a dark small object. But at the

21
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:26.594
same time, attention also depends on our internal goals

22
00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:30.704
, what we are looking for in what we see

23
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:36.034
. And so it's a very interesting balance between the

24
00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:42.448
outside world and our internal mental representation. And uh

25
00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.829
um so, in the case, when it comes

26
00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:49.370
to people, uh so others on specifics, um

27
00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:53.838
there are uh the first thing that like the first

28
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.079
thing that we attend to are, are the uh

29
00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.469
the research in cognitive neuroscience has suggested that there is

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.299
a sort of a hierarchy of the things that we

31
00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:12.949
care about first and this hierarchy goes by eyes,

32
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.349
face and then the rest of the body. So

33
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.588
, um but again, like a what what we

34
00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.020
we attend first depends on what we are looking for

35
00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:30.580
in the outside world. So for instance, if

36
00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:32.080
we are looking, for instance, for an object

37
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:35.868
, for an interaction with another person, we might

38
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.569
, we might, we might be attending more the

39
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.990
limbs. So the arms, the hands than the

40
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.639
face, but generally a good, a good summary

41
00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.429
is that, you know, the face and eyes

42
00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.399
come first. But when we look at other people

43
00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.099
and will later on in our conversation, we're going

44
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.879
to get into more detail in terms of, for

45
00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.409
example, when people are facing one another or in

46
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.919
terms of how they uh present themselves in relation to

47
00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.349
1 to 1 another, what kinds of things we

48
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.319
pay attention to and what kinds of information we get

49
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.189
from those kinds of, let's say interactions? Are

50
00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:21.580
there generally speaking, are there particular kinds of information

51
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.969
that we are looking for? When we perceive other

52
00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:30.860
people in either in isolation or in interaction with others

53
00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:37.740
. Um So, um we pay attention to a

54
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.429
lot of things uh because we, we care about

55
00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.300
a lot of things. Uh But uh um we

56
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:51.050
can uh synthesize these uh um the features that we

57
00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:55.719
care about in two categories. One is uh those

58
00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.338
features that help us to understand who is the other

59
00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.580
, who the other is, who are you And

60
00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:05.808
the others are the features that uh uh help us

61
00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.729
understand what are you doing? So there are these

62
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.338
two aspects of another that we consider very important for

63
00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.259
our immediate behavior and also for our survival. So

64
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.000
when we look at another, at another person,

65
00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.910
uh we are very efficient, our system, our

66
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.238
visual system is very efficient at extracting a number of

67
00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:39.480
important pieces of information that allow to, for instance

68
00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:45.199
, decide or establish surely the gender, the age

69
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.983
, we have very sensitive to the cues that suggest

70
00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:54.824
the age of our, of the other, the

71
00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:58.394
origin, the race. There are, there is

72
00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:01.963
a full line of research suggesting that there are very

73
00:05:01.975 --> 00:05:06.264
subtle ways in which difference in the race of the

74
00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:11.939
others affect our behavior. Um And uh uh of

75
00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.858
course, uh also we can extract information from just

76
00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.100
the visual appearance by just looking at the others,

77
00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:24.488
we can start information about the status, for instance

78
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.149
, how dominant the person is in the social hierarchy

79
00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.988
and the state. So the mental state, the

80
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.790
mood of the person. There are beautiful experiments showing

81
00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:40.069
that just by looking at the motion pattern. So

82
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.709
the way in which another uh moves we are very

83
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.548
accurate in determining uh uh their emotion, whether it

84
00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.069
is happy or sad and so on. And this

85
00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:54.250
is, you know, the category of features that

86
00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.509
I define as those that allow us to understand who

87
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:01.480
the other is. But then there is another set

88
00:06:01.488 --> 00:06:06.470
of features that we are very good at uh processing

89
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.959
and extracting from visual information from just looking at the

90
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.879
others, which are the features that allow us to

91
00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.600
understand what the other is up to what it is

92
00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:19.660
about to do. Um And these features are especially

93
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.369
important in the context of social interaction. So it's

94
00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:30.588
very important um to uh observe the others interacting between

95
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.350
each other with each other to construct a number of

96
00:06:33.358 --> 00:06:39.488
features that allow us to understand. Uh again,

97
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.220
is a role in the society in a, in

98
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.309
a specific context, but also more generally, um

99
00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.019
whether a person is uh um in the, in

100
00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:56.778
the social hierarchy above or below the other person,

101
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.579
uh the level of intimacy, the social distance.

102
00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.480
Uh And also from the way in which two interact

103
00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:09.369
with each other, we can immediately understand with a

104
00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:14.738
very fine sensitivity to the motion patterns, the way

105
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.338
in which people move and interact with each other,

106
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.858
whether they're having a they are in a friendly relationship

107
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:25.809
, whether they're sharing the same goal or they are

108
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:29.230
competing, whether they're helping each other and so on

109
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.220
. All these, all this information comes out of

110
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:40.540
almost a first glance to the others. A and

111
00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:42.939
B. By the way, uh, you mentioned

112
00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:45.819
, uh, several different things there, like,

113
00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:50.059
for example, people's race or ethnicity, I mean

114
00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.939
, uh, uh, do we know to what

115
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.548
extent some of the things or the kinds of informations

116
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.738
we, uh, the kind of information we want

117
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.949
to acquire from other people and the kinds of things

118
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.269
and behaviors we pay attention to. I, if

119
00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:09.983
at least to some extent they are culturally learned.

120
00:08:09.994 --> 00:08:11.535
There is, I mean, my pay, paying

121
00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:18.074
attention to one person's ethnicity is something that I learn

122
00:08:18.084 --> 00:08:20.915
culturally to pay attention to or if all of these

123
00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:24.238
things or at least a few of them, uh

124
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.420
, are sort of quote unquote, I innate.

125
00:08:28.428 --> 00:08:33.548
There is even newborns already pay some attention to some

126
00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:37.798
of these features and behaviors. W what do we

127
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:41.190
know exactly about that? So that's, um,

128
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.408
that's a very interesting question that has been the subject

129
00:08:43.418 --> 00:08:48.450
of, uh, research for decades. Uh And

130
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.460
, uh, of course, there are many unknown

131
00:08:50.469 --> 00:08:52.548
, so many things that we don't know yet.

132
00:08:52.668 --> 00:08:54.149
But, uh, uh, certainly, uh,

133
00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:58.408
we can say that humans are born with, uh

134
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.690
, uh, innate, an innate or at least

135
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.195
very early when I say early, I mean,

136
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:13.625
within hours from birth ability to recognize faces to detect

137
00:09:13.844 --> 00:09:20.104
a specific kind of motion which we call biological motion

138
00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:24.625
. And that's the specific way in which biological entities

139
00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:26.274
moves, that is very different. For instance,

140
00:09:26.283 --> 00:09:31.899
from the mechanical motion. Uh humans are also born

141
00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:37.129
with uh uh a very early capacity to uh attend

142
00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:41.250
to the other side and know where the others are

143
00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:46.308
looking at us. So when we are being addressed

144
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.629
, relative to when the others are looking somewhere else

145
00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:52.700
, and we also have a very early uh and

146
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.070
efficient capacity to follow the other gaze. So to

147
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.649
know that's one of the first thing, maybe the

148
00:09:58.658 --> 00:10:03.418
most important thing that we uh look at when we

149
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:09.408
process others where they're looking, which anticipates or predicts

150
00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:11.058
what they are going to do. So if they

151
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.849
are looking at me, this is probably a signal

152
00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:16.969
, a very strong signal of social engagement is looking

153
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:20.428
for social engagement is looking away, OK, where

154
00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:24.859
he or she is looking. So these are the

155
00:10:24.869 --> 00:10:31.048
things that uh infants within hours or days from birth

156
00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:37.450
are very sensitive to. And uh um we share

157
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.000
many of these processes, many of these mechanisms that

158
00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:46.330
make us so efficient in processing socially relevant stimuli with

159
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.644
non human species. Like we have seen in a

160
00:10:48.654 --> 00:10:54.455
similar uh behaviors, very early behaviors in uh various

161
00:10:54.465 --> 00:11:00.195
species of monkeys, but also in uh uh chickens

162
00:11:00.205 --> 00:11:01.724
, for instance, or in a species that um

163
00:11:01.734 --> 00:11:07.580
are farther away from us. Uh Then there are

164
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.019
other aspects as you asked about the race or the

165
00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:15.590
age, there are other aspects that emerge relatively early

166
00:11:15.719 --> 00:11:16.619
. So there are, there is, for instance

167
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:20.070
, this phenomenon known as the, as the other

168
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.000
race effect, which refers to the um to the

169
00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:31.418
basically very early sensitivity to uh people or to individuals

170
00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:35.033
who are from a different race than ours. Uh

171
00:11:35.043 --> 00:11:37.913
There is something similar, for instance, in speech

172
00:11:37.923 --> 00:11:45.875
perception, this early sensitivity to differentiate between uh speech

173
00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:50.144
sound that are from our native language and speech sounds

174
00:11:50.154 --> 00:11:52.553
that are from another language. For instance, Indians

175
00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:58.494
have some uh uh uh uh sounds, some phonological

176
00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:03.154
sounds that we don't have like the the we don't

177
00:12:03.163 --> 00:12:05.989
have these sounds in our language. And very early

178
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.308
on infants are capable of discriminating between the sounds of

179
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.928
their native language and sounds from other languages. But

180
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.109
this is this kind of, you know, sensitivity

181
00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:24.609
to these more culturally determined differences um seems to be

182
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:30.038
the result of a learning process which operates very rapidly

183
00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:33.690
again, within months from birth, infants can make

184
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.854
this subtle discrimination. But it's because when they are

185
00:12:37.864 --> 00:12:39.783
born, they are born and they are immediately immersed

186
00:12:39.994 --> 00:12:43.274
in a very rich social environment. And so they

187
00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:48.205
immediately pick up the features that are typical or their

188
00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:54.014
native social environment and immediately become capable of distinguishing those

189
00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.933
features that are very important from their integration in their

190
00:12:56.945 --> 00:13:01.835
own society, from uh features that don't belong to

191
00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:05.024
their own, to their own cultural uh group.

192
00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:07.840
So in my first question, one of the things

193
00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:11.479
you mentioned that people and also infants in this case

194
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.830
, pay lots of attention to is the face,

195
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.109
in particular features of the face, like the eyes

196
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:22.239
. For example, eye gaze, uh apart from

197
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.200
eye gaze, what are some of the other features

198
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.029
of the face that people tend to pay attention to

199
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.269
? And what kinds of information do we get from

200
00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:35.750
that? Um The uh human ability to process a

201
00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:39.719
phase is impressive. I would say that there is

202
00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:45.509
nothing that uh uh uh there is nothing that is

203
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:52.788
so efficient, so uh tuned uh uh than the

204
00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:56.349
human ability for face perception. So just by looking

205
00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:58.719
at the face, we, as I said,

206
00:13:58.729 --> 00:14:03.038
we are able to, first of all immediately recognize

207
00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:07.048
the identity and discriminate between the two faces even when

208
00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:13.408
there is a lot of similarity. Um And uh

209
00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:16.029
uh there are uh there are again, two different

210
00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:20.099
aspects, uh two different categories of features that we

211
00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:26.590
uh uh one category is uh uh what allows us

212
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:31.908
to identify a person. So as I said,

213
00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:35.509
to categorize a person in terms of gender, race

214
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:39.308
, age. And if we know the person also

215
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.009
immediately assign a name to that person, an identity

216
00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:46.764
to that person. And so immediately retrieve all the

217
00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:48.553
, you know, knowledge and information that we have

218
00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:52.945
about that person. This this is a very rapid

219
00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:56.904
, very efficient mechanism. And then there is another

220
00:14:56.913 --> 00:15:01.519
uh family, another set of features that allows us

221
00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:05.979
to uh uh to establish, to, to,

222
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.369
to process the actions of the face. And in

223
00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:13.538
the case of faces, actions uh are uh manifestation

224
00:15:13.548 --> 00:15:18.700
of manifestation of two things. One is the communication

225
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.119
. So by looking at faces, just the way

226
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:26.479
in which the face move uh moves is very important

227
00:15:26.489 --> 00:15:30.393
for uh speech perception. For we know that if

228
00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:33.121
we have access to the face of the speaker,

229
00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:37.741
our speech processing, so our ability to process and

230
00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:41.121
to understand what the speaker is saying is much more

231
00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:43.513
efficient. And there are a lot of interesting phenomena

232
00:15:43.523 --> 00:15:48.543
that show that in fact, the facial movements can

233
00:15:48.552 --> 00:15:54.001
affect also the acoustic signal, the acoustic information what

234
00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:58.335
we hear. So if I show him movement of

235
00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:03.184
the lips that is not compatible with the sound that

236
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:07.495
I'm producing, that the speaker is producing. And

237
00:16:07.504 --> 00:16:11.306
there are very nice experiments that manipulate the mismatch between

238
00:16:11.315 --> 00:16:15.666
the lips movement and and the sound you see that

239
00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:21.514
we perceive a distorted sound, which means that what

240
00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:23.975
we see in the movements of the face affects what

241
00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:27.308
we hear. And also the second, the second

242
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.969
type of action information conveys uh um information about emotions

243
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.678
. We know that uh you know, very,

244
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.558
we have a very rich repertoire of facial uh actions

245
00:16:42.788 --> 00:16:51.058
that convey um as well rich um set of different

246
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.450
emotions. And so these two family like the features

247
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.369
to define who a person is and the features to

248
00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:03.904
define what the the face is doing is trying to

249
00:17:03.913 --> 00:17:07.864
communicate. Um of course, are tightly related but

250
00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:11.265
can also be dissociated. And when I say dissociated

251
00:17:11.275 --> 00:17:15.805
, I imply that they are actually um features that

252
00:17:15.814 --> 00:17:19.223
are processes in partially different parts of the brain,

253
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.328
of course, very strongly integrated. So now I

254
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:29.279
would like to ask you about something very specific that

255
00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:33.299
I read about in your work. What is facing

256
00:17:33.309 --> 00:17:37.459
di perception? And does it relate in any way

257
00:17:37.469 --> 00:17:44.150
to face perception? So um for many uh years

258
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.549
, um for many decades, cognitive neuroscience has studies

259
00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:49.630
. Of course, we have this uh very strong

260
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.650
uh and understandable interest uh for social perception, social

261
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.239
cognition, how we understand how we recognize others.

262
00:17:57.489 --> 00:18:00.019
But for many decades, these questions have been,

263
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:06.140
these questions have been addressed by uh studying uh the

264
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.059
perception of the processing of individual faces, individual bodies

265
00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:18.259
, individual movements. Uh until uh when um researchers

266
00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:23.670
including myself and the people working with me uh decided

267
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.939
to see uh to study what happens to all these

268
00:18:27.949 --> 00:18:32.959
beautiful mechanism that I've been talking about uh to process

269
00:18:32.969 --> 00:18:36.729
faces, motion bodies. When instead of seeing one

270
00:18:36.739 --> 00:18:40.199
face, one person, you see two people together

271
00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:44.608
, all these um sensitivity, all these tuning to

272
00:18:44.618 --> 00:18:48.509
all these features is preserved or there is something else

273
00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:52.680
that happens and what we have seen. So the

274
00:18:52.689 --> 00:18:56.479
main interesting result that we found when we started asking

275
00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:59.160
this kind of question was that as I said the

276
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.229
faces are very special to our visual system and to

277
00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:07.358
the whole brain because they are fundamental to understand interact

278
00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:11.989
, to recognize others. But what we saw is

279
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.098
that um when we see instead of one phase,

280
00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:21.779
two phases, uh all these uh very efficient uh

281
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:29.489
uh processing uh is preserved, particularly one, the

282
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.568
others are perceived as if they are interacting, which

283
00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:36.088
means face to face. So we did a very

284
00:19:36.098 --> 00:19:38.868
simple experiment. We, we were studying, you

285
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.289
know, the the efficiency of visual recognition of multiple

286
00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:47.868
bodies. And so we presented the pairs of bodies

287
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.269
in different special configurations. And we soon realized that

288
00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:59.029
subjects were particularly efficient at recognizing multiple bodies as efficient

289
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.989
as they are at recognizing one face when these two

290
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.809
bodies are put face to face relative to when they

291
00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:11.420
are in any other configuration. And so that was

292
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.279
the first insight. The first in the first uh

293
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:18.699
uh piece of information that suggests to us that there

294
00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:22.900
might be something really special uh in the brain uh

295
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:29.150
uh about uh uh the perception of what we call

296
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.699
the facing diet. Now, why the fishing diet

297
00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:36.769
? Why two people face to face would be special

298
00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:41.559
to our visual system? Well, this is an

299
00:20:41.568 --> 00:20:45.680
open question but the intuitive response is that this configuration

300
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:49.009
, when we put two people face to face,

301
00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:56.309
this is the prototypical configuration of human social interactions.

302
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.170
So when we interact with others, we privilege this

303
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.509
face to face positioning, because this face to face

304
00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:08.299
positioning gives us access to the other side to the

305
00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.890
others. Face full face. So we can extract

306
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:17.880
information about uh emotions. And uh also uh it

307
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.118
gives us access to the whole body. So it's

308
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.500
the the perfect viewpoint to have as much information as

309
00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:27.959
possible from the other. And so to facilitate uh

310
00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:33.239
interaction. And so the idea is that this facial

311
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.469
configuration, these are, these are face to face

312
00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:40.598
configuration of body is so important for our social life

313
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.838
and so redundant. So, recurrent in our social

314
00:21:44.848 --> 00:21:48.598
environment that the human brain has developed a mechanism that

315
00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:52.759
make the processing of these two bodies especially efficient.

316
00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:56.239
And this is confirmed by if we look at the

317
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.729
uh evolutionary psychology literature, uh you know, people

318
00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:07.209
have studied uh how often humans spend, how much

319
00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:11.150
time humans spend in certain, you know, special

320
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.779
positioning, special positions relative to each other. And

321
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:18.009
they have seen that not just humans, but also

322
00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:23.959
monkeys and probably other species spend uh more than uh

323
00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:30.140
the 50% of their time in social interaction, facing

324
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.969
, facing another. So face to face with another

325
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:36.118
. And most of the time uh I I uh

326
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.818
the most frequent composition involves two people. So face

327
00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:47.219
to face di adding interaction seems to be uh an

328
00:22:47.229 --> 00:22:55.559
important uh recurrent uh uh structure in our social life

329
00:22:55.568 --> 00:22:59.269
in our social world. So this is already,

330
00:22:59.279 --> 00:23:04.068
I guess one aspect of studying social sin perception,

331
00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:07.618
right? And uh one of the things associated with

332
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.328
that or a concept, I guess in this case

333
00:23:11.338 --> 00:23:15.719
is minimal social sin. So what is that concept

334
00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:21.390
really about? And what can you study through it

335
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.140
? So it's uh uh it's uh this idea of

336
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.259
minimal. So social scenes refer to what I've just

337
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:30.049
described. So when we started this research, we

338
00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:33.098
wanted to see to isolate, to get really like

339
00:23:33.108 --> 00:23:37.059
we, we see a lot of interactions, all

340
00:23:37.068 --> 00:23:41.189
kind of uh actions that people perform on each other

341
00:23:41.199 --> 00:23:45.328
or with each other. Uh uh people act uh

342
00:23:45.338 --> 00:23:48.895
in uh diets, in groups. So we have

343
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.135
crowds of people doing things together so that the social

344
00:23:52.145 --> 00:23:56.256
interaction that the range of social interactions is possible.

345
00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:59.756
Social interactions is very broad. But we wanted to

346
00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:04.016
get to the minimal unit. What if we if

347
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:08.625
we remove all the unnecessary features and we get to

348
00:24:08.635 --> 00:24:12.596
the core structure of the social interaction, what remains

349
00:24:14.523 --> 00:24:18.743
and what remains is this uh uh two body configuration

350
00:24:18.753 --> 00:24:23.124
. So this configuration that involves two bodies or two

351
00:24:23.134 --> 00:24:26.063
phases in general, two people, two social agents

352
00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:33.394
facing closely like in special proximity and facing each other

353
00:24:33.614 --> 00:24:37.104
. So and this is this is really like.

354
00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:41.201
So we decided to study this configuration of two bodies

355
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:45.240
is a facing diet just like we have studied other

356
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.140
objects in visual perception, just like we have studied

357
00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:52.211
faces, we have studied bodies, we have studied

358
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.560
any other object in the world, we consider this

359
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.921
a new object of visual perception. This is a

360
00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:03.890
configuration which is the early rudimentary representation of a social

361
00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:07.930
interaction. Uh And so, uh we've talked earlier

362
00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:14.449
about how people interpret when they see someone or a

363
00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:18.390
di have of people facing each other. So apart

364
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.000
from facing each other, what are perhaps some of

365
00:25:22.009 --> 00:25:26.519
the other kinds of cues that people take in when

366
00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:32.890
distinguishing between an interacting and a non interacting, died

367
00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:36.680
in crowds, for example. Yeah. So we

368
00:25:36.689 --> 00:25:38.729
have uh again, just like in the case of

369
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:42.818
face perception, we are now this is a very

370
00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:47.289
recent line of research that is really considering this new

371
00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:49.338
object of social perception, which is not one body

372
00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:52.949
, not one face, not one action but two

373
00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:56.199
people together. And so we are now discovering all

374
00:25:56.209 --> 00:26:00.608
the information that is rapidly extracted from this stimuli.

375
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.400
And so as you said, one is the relative

376
00:26:04.505 --> 00:26:07.935
positioning, what we call the facing where they are

377
00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:11.786
facing each other or not or they are facing away

378
00:26:11.796 --> 00:26:14.405
from each other. But there are another uh a

379
00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:17.955
large family of, of, of a large set

380
00:26:17.964 --> 00:26:22.605
of cues that uh uh we, we think and

381
00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:26.036
research suggests that are really relevant to process, to

382
00:26:26.046 --> 00:26:30.566
initiate the processing of social interaction. Some of of

383
00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:33.134
such cues are, for instance, as I said

384
00:26:33.144 --> 00:26:37.842
, the special proxy, how close in space to

385
00:26:37.852 --> 00:26:41.141
people are uh the touch, whether they are in

386
00:26:41.151 --> 00:26:45.801
contact, they are touching or not. So uh

387
00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:49.092
others are the mimicry, whether you know their body

388
00:26:49.102 --> 00:26:53.500
postures or their facial expression look alike, which means

389
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.290
that which, which is a feature of the social

390
00:26:56.301 --> 00:27:00.201
interaction. When we interact with someone, we tend

391
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:06.170
to have this automatic mimicry of their behavior. And

392
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.979
we can see from outside when two people are interacting

393
00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:12.059
, they tend to uh imitate themselves, they tend

394
00:27:12.068 --> 00:27:15.818
to coordinate or to synchronize. So, coordinations,

395
00:27:15.828 --> 00:27:22.989
synchrony, miry um distance openness like the typically people

396
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.039
that are interacting and have this posture that is open

397
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:30.969
to each other. And these are very uh measurable

398
00:27:32.321 --> 00:27:36.141
. We can take, you know, photos of

399
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:40.332
interacting people and really measure all these things. And

400
00:27:40.342 --> 00:27:44.682
this is exactly what uh um scientists are doing right

401
00:27:44.692 --> 00:27:48.551
now. Uh First of all, to understand which

402
00:27:48.561 --> 00:27:52.051
are the the the the properties, the features of

403
00:27:52.061 --> 00:27:55.701
an interaction that we process, that we extract the

404
00:27:55.711 --> 00:28:00.144
uh uh from which we make is about the social

405
00:28:00.153 --> 00:28:03.163
relationship between two people. But also to understand whether

406
00:28:03.173 --> 00:28:07.423
there is a hierarchy between these things. So what

407
00:28:07.432 --> 00:28:08.942
is the relation between these things? We don't have

408
00:28:08.952 --> 00:28:11.604
the answer to this question yet. But you know

409
00:28:11.614 --> 00:28:15.634
, intuitively, 1 may think that if two people

410
00:28:15.644 --> 00:28:19.063
are face to face, they are probably interacting or

411
00:28:19.073 --> 00:28:26.505
this is what our brain spontaneously. But uh you

412
00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:30.046
know, if you start manipulating the distance, so

413
00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:33.695
you increase the distance between them, probably the effect

414
00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:38.644
of facings starts, you know, diminishing, diminishing

415
00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:41.576
. So and it would be interesting to see at

416
00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:47.915
which point, the distance breaks the effect of facings

417
00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:51.739
whether it does it at all. So basically,

418
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.299
this is the kind of questions that we are now

419
00:28:53.309 --> 00:29:00.130
asking to um to, to understand how because that's

420
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.318
the thing. The question is not whether we understand

421
00:29:03.328 --> 00:29:07.729
social interaction and what we understand about social interaction.

422
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.049
Because we do understand social interaction, we are very

423
00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:15.493
, very rapid at you know, understanding what kind

424
00:29:15.505 --> 00:29:18.755
of relation there is between two people just by looking

425
00:29:18.765 --> 00:29:22.005
at these people. And uh we understand a lot

426
00:29:22.015 --> 00:29:25.703
of things, we can extract a lot of kind

427
00:29:25.713 --> 00:29:29.644
of information just by looking at how two people interact

428
00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:32.904
with each other. But the question that we're trying

429
00:29:32.914 --> 00:29:37.809
to answer is how we do it, how our

430
00:29:37.818 --> 00:29:41.529
brain does it. So this is why it's important

431
00:29:41.539 --> 00:29:45.588
to understand. OK, what are the basic cues

432
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.699
that the visual system extracts from the structure of the

433
00:29:49.709 --> 00:29:55.809
input or from what we see outside that starts this

434
00:29:55.818 --> 00:29:59.959
process that then leads to a full understanding of the

435
00:29:59.969 --> 00:30:03.779
social interaction. And of course, it's very interesting

436
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:08.509
to understand or know what these basic cues are.

437
00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:11.779
I mean, the basic kinds of things that people

438
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:15.959
pay attention to in the social scene to perceive and

439
00:30:15.969 --> 00:30:19.309
interpret how people relate to one another and what people

440
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:23.219
are doing that is socially relevant there. But I

441
00:30:23.229 --> 00:30:27.088
I would imagine that something that is also very interesting

442
00:30:27.098 --> 00:30:30.150
to understand these uh of course, we do this

443
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.229
and in the split of a second it's lots of

444
00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:37.150
information but we process it very, very quickly.

445
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.880
But at the same time, I mean, it's

446
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.229
not like isolated cues but we are sort of taking

447
00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:48.809
it all in, at the same time. I

448
00:30:48.818 --> 00:30:52.680
mean, it's like several different cues that we process

449
00:30:52.828 --> 00:30:56.578
very quickly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So

450
00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:57.809
that's, uh, um, like, uh,

451
00:30:57.818 --> 00:31:00.289
you know, the, of course, uh,

452
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:04.059
the, the result of uh this uh uh process

453
00:31:04.068 --> 00:31:08.719
is uh extremely impressive, as you said in the

454
00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:15.078
um in, in a few uh tens or hundreds

455
00:31:15.088 --> 00:31:18.068
of milliseconds. So we are capable of, you

456
00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:19.621
know, not exactly exactly who you are, what

457
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:22.520
you're doing and what's your relationship with another? If

458
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.171
you think about it, it's pretty impressive. Now

459
00:31:26.182 --> 00:31:30.891
, the question again is how the brain does it

460
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:34.571
. So we are uh a little bit uh uh

461
00:31:34.582 --> 00:31:40.721
like farther away from an answer to this question for

462
00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:41.472
tourism. As I said, like we know a

463
00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:45.663
lot about face perception and body perception and biological motion

464
00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:49.273
perception. And that's a good basis I think to

465
00:31:49.284 --> 00:31:52.644
start this enterprise of, you know, understanding how

466
00:31:52.692 --> 00:31:59.923
we understand our complex social world. But uh um

467
00:32:00.134 --> 00:32:02.284
you know, there are questions that are because of

468
00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:07.394
course, understanding what the others are doing and how

469
00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:09.836
they relate to each other also requires to understand what

470
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:13.855
they, what they have in mind, to understand

471
00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:17.875
their goals, their intention, their motivations and uh

472
00:32:17.884 --> 00:32:23.714
uh these, these questions fall under the big umbrella

473
00:32:23.724 --> 00:32:30.400
of social cognition, um social neuroscience. And uh

474
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:35.420
this is a very young enterprise. We have begun

475
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.180
asking this question uh a few years ago and uh

476
00:32:39.189 --> 00:32:43.250
there is a lot of effort and a lot of

477
00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:45.559
energy, a lot of resources now that are dedicated

478
00:32:45.568 --> 00:32:50.279
to this kind of research, mostly because it's clear

479
00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:54.910
that uh um the society that we are building,

480
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.229
that we have built and that we are building relies

481
00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:01.479
on our ability to manage people, to organize a

482
00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:06.750
group of people, to understand how people relate to

483
00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:09.380
each other. So to be able to sustain this

484
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:15.088
kind of social environment that we live in, we

485
00:33:15.108 --> 00:33:17.199
have to understand as much as we can about the

486
00:33:17.209 --> 00:33:21.489
human social brain. But uh again, this is

487
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.299
a very young uh enterprise. And so most of

488
00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:29.150
the questions are still open to, to discussion.

489
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:31.848
Mhm Right. So, and since we're talking here

490
00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:36.608
also about the brain, of course, um And

491
00:33:36.618 --> 00:33:43.039
we are referring mostly to spatial information, spatial cues

492
00:33:43.049 --> 00:33:45.049
, they are processed of course by the visual system

493
00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:51.180
. And is it the case that socially relevant spatial

494
00:33:51.189 --> 00:33:58.410
relations are represented visually differently than stimuli that are just

495
00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:04.608
unrelated or appear unrelated to one another? Yeah,

496
00:34:04.618 --> 00:34:07.930
absolutely. So this is basically the uh one of

497
00:34:07.939 --> 00:34:10.438
the main findings of our research in the, in

498
00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.760
the recent years. Uh So, uh as I

499
00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:16.849
said, we have first uh uh found uh uh

500
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.409
initial evidence in our, in our empirical data and

501
00:34:21.418 --> 00:34:27.530
our empirical results suggesting that uh uh facing individuals,

502
00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:30.958
which is our, which is a proxy of social

503
00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.550
interacting individuals. So when I say facing, I'm

504
00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:40.349
implying that this positioning is somehow suggesting to our brain

505
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.708
that these two people are interacting. And this is

506
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.657
why it's so important for our brain. So as

507
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:49.318
I said, we have found that facing individuals are

508
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:53.148
processed uh uh more efficiently than the very same individuals

509
00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:58.728
uh in, in a different special relation. And

510
00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:02.358
uh uh we have begun to show that uh the

511
00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:08.739
very specialized mechanism that uh we have learned to appreciate

512
00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:15.188
in perception, also apply to this configuration of seemingly

513
00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:20.688
interacting bodies, so face to face bodies. And

514
00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:22.188
uh uh and then we have found that I use

515
00:35:22.199 --> 00:35:25.239
a lot of uh functional MRI, which is a

516
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:31.409
neuroimaging methodology that allows to record the brain at work

517
00:35:31.418 --> 00:35:36.349
while it's working. So to look into the brain

518
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.840
uh uh to measure the brain activity during um any

519
00:35:39.849 --> 00:35:44.949
kind of cognitive task. And uh so using F

520
00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:47.039
MRI, we have seen that visually in the visual

521
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:52.458
areas. So in the areas dedicated to face body

522
00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:55.989
, biological motion perception, the very same bodies.

523
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.958
So the two the two bodies, the very same

524
00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:04.829
bodies are processed differently when they are face to face

525
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.679
, relative to when they're back to back. And

526
00:36:07.688 --> 00:36:12.958
this is pretty impressive because uh so we just had

527
00:36:12.969 --> 00:36:15.719
a similar with the two bodies either positioned face to

528
00:36:15.728 --> 00:36:20.389
face or identically just flipped so that they look back

529
00:36:20.398 --> 00:36:22.898
to back. So from a visual viewpoint, these

530
00:36:22.909 --> 00:36:28.519
two stimuli carry exactly the same information. The same

531
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.782
amount of information is exactly the same number of pixels

532
00:36:30.791 --> 00:36:34.742
, the same body shapes, the same postures,

533
00:36:34.751 --> 00:36:37.311
the same color brightness, all the visual information that

534
00:36:37.322 --> 00:36:40.972
you think of. But just the fact that they

535
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:44.572
are face to face, their positioning, to face

536
00:36:44.583 --> 00:36:47.492
each other or facing away from each other drives all

537
00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:52.456
kinds of different different effects in the visual cortex.

538
00:36:52.465 --> 00:36:54.186
So for instance, the visual cortex and in general

539
00:36:54.195 --> 00:36:58.686
, the level of activity in the areas for face

540
00:36:58.695 --> 00:37:01.965
and body perception is significantly higher. So the regions

541
00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:06.885
respond more when the bodies are face to face,

542
00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:08.625
relative to when the two people are back to back

543
00:37:08.635 --> 00:37:13.275
, which is already I think very interesting. But

544
00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:15.750
also, uh for instance, uh we have found

545
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.199
using more sophisticated analytic methods uh on uh uh uh

546
00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:27.550
F MRI data that uh the representation of each individual

547
00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:31.728
body is more accurate. So the brain represent each

548
00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:37.599
individual body better if the body appears in a relation

549
00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:42.489
in a social relation with another than when the body

550
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.750
is presented in isolation. So yeah, the the

551
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.208
the short answer is that yes, there is something

552
00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:52.369
special and when I say special, I mean face

553
00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:54.978
like special in a sense. And so as I

554
00:37:54.989 --> 00:37:59.938
said repeatedly uh is like a face perception is the

555
00:37:59.949 --> 00:38:05.139
gold standard of the efficiency of human visual perception.

556
00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:07.909
And so what we see is that some of these

557
00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:13.228
very efficient mechanisms that we have evolved developed to process

558
00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:19.929
faces are used to process interacting people. And so

559
00:38:19.938 --> 00:38:23.148
still about perception that there's something very specific that I

560
00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:27.989
haven't asked you about yet. So what is body

561
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.309
form and body motion perception? And in what ways

562
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:37.610
exactly do these specific kinds of perception contribute to processing

563
00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:43.418
social events? So uh these are uh body but

564
00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:49.429
form and body motion are the two fundamental component of

565
00:38:49.438 --> 00:38:53.199
the visual system uses to build representation of an action

566
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:58.398
. So to understand another's action, so what another

567
00:38:58.409 --> 00:39:00.128
person for instance is doing but it is true also

568
00:39:00.139 --> 00:39:05.648
for the action of animals and also for the movements

569
00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:10.530
of objects we need to extract mentioned about their structure

570
00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:13.418
. So for instance, in the case of a

571
00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:17.989
person, um how the various body parts are positioning

572
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.668
with respect to each other. So if the hand

573
00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:24.688
is here or here, this defines a different body

574
00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:29.070
posture, so a different body shape. So this

575
00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:35.110
is the body form um information and then there is

576
00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:38.699
the other side that is the motion. So how

577
00:39:38.728 --> 00:39:45.188
the position of each part changes from time to time

578
00:39:45.289 --> 00:39:49.019
and this defines the motion pattern. So these are

579
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.489
two different aspects that then they are integrated. So

580
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.989
these are the body form and our body shape and

581
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.628
the body motion uh are dissociated different uh different processes

582
00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:07.050
. Uh also because they are um uh implemented,

583
00:40:07.059 --> 00:40:12.438
they are computed in different parts in different brain regions

584
00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:15.329
. So we know that these are two different aspects

585
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.760
. But of course, the regions that care about

586
00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:21.619
the body motion and the regions that care about body

587
00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:25.809
shape work uh in sync work really like in a

588
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.978
close interaction with each other. We say that they

589
00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:34.519
are functionally connected because the information needs to be integrated

590
00:40:34.559 --> 00:40:39.429
to deliver the representation of an action of an action

591
00:40:39.438 --> 00:40:43.809
, which is the beginning of the process for action

592
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.398
understanding. So we first need to understand the body

593
00:40:47.409 --> 00:40:51.030
posture, the body motion. And from there,

594
00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:54.809
we can start all the inferential processes that allow us

595
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.500
to understand what the other, what the other's action

596
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.898
goal is, uh what the intention of the others

597
00:41:01.909 --> 00:41:05.469
are. And this, this is what we call

598
00:41:05.478 --> 00:41:09.110
the social inference. By the way body form and

599
00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:14.898
body motion perception are these in any way forms of

600
00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:21.039
embodied cognition. So, um no, these are

601
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.320
visual processes. So the idea of embodied cognition,

602
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:27.239
the general idea of embodied cognition is that uh uh

603
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:32.619
much of our cognitive life depends on our uh experience

604
00:41:32.628 --> 00:41:37.280
in the environment. So it's based on in particularly

605
00:41:37.289 --> 00:41:40.563
impact in particular our motor experience. So uh but

606
00:41:40.574 --> 00:41:45.023
when I talked about the body uh form and body

607
00:41:45.034 --> 00:41:47.144
motion, I was referring to visual processes like the

608
00:41:47.155 --> 00:41:53.333
processing tool to extract information uh from the physical structure

609
00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:59.340
of the of the of the input. Now does

610
00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:02.340
our experience, our experience, our action, motor

611
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:06.559
experience in the environment affects the way in which we

612
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:12.010
process other actions and the social interactions. So we

613
00:42:12.019 --> 00:42:15.469
know that uh of course, like we uh we

614
00:42:15.478 --> 00:42:17.938
are in, we are in bodies like the brain

615
00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:22.610
is integrated in a body that has a certain type

616
00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:27.119
of experience. And the the way like our history

617
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:30.039
of interaction, the environment affects how we perceive other

618
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:37.760
actions. There is a very rich and complex literature

619
00:42:37.769 --> 00:42:40.340
on this, you know, relationship between action,

620
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:45.340
understanding and the mo motor experience. We know much

621
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:51.289
less about how our experience of social interaction, so

622
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.039
of interacting with others affect the way in which we

623
00:42:54.050 --> 00:43:00.510
understand others, social interactions. I I think there

624
00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:04.119
is no, there is no really like a fully

625
00:43:04.128 --> 00:43:07.929
developed line of research yet on this. But uh

626
00:43:07.938 --> 00:43:12.039
you know, like uh uh there are a number

627
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.500
of nontrivial questions to ask. For instance, the

628
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.639
idea is that when I observe and others perform another

629
00:43:17.648 --> 00:43:21.340
, performing an action in order to understand that's the

630
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:24.199
basic idea of embodiment to understand what the other is

631
00:43:24.208 --> 00:43:28.820
doing. I need to sort of use this as

632
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:31.699
simulation process. I have to internally simulate the same

633
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:35.969
action and this allows me to understand what the others

634
00:43:35.978 --> 00:43:37.878
is doing. But now in the context of social

635
00:43:37.889 --> 00:43:43.309
interaction, I'm observing two people or more people interacting

636
00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.559
with each other. So how does the motor simulation

637
00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:52.668
work like can we simulate multiple actions at the same

638
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:54.250
time? So there are more people interacting. Our

639
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.409
motor system is busy at you know, simulating all

640
00:43:58.418 --> 00:44:00.909
these actions like simultaneously. We are not sure the

641
00:44:00.918 --> 00:44:04.309
motor system can do it. We we are not

642
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.320
sure the motor system can hold the representation of multiple

643
00:44:07.329 --> 00:44:12.530
motor programs at the same time. And uh oh

644
00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:14.978
you know, we can think oh maybe the the

645
00:44:14.989 --> 00:44:17.789
the visual system selects the most important the more of

646
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.559
two agents. And this is what it follows that

647
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.110
there is research that shows that we are very good

648
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.969
at detecting in an interaction, who is the agent

649
00:44:25.978 --> 00:44:28.929
and who is the patient. So who is the

650
00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:32.079
one who is acting on the other? And so

651
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.360
maybe, and we know that um the the system

652
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:39.280
, the brain privileges information about agents. So one

653
00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:45.349
possibility is that the motor simulation also privileges the simulation

654
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.119
of the action of the person who is recognized as

655
00:44:47.128 --> 00:44:50.539
the agent. But again, these are all possible

656
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.280
solutions. But uh we don't know the answer yet

657
00:44:53.958 --> 00:45:00.099
, but at least potentially there's some space for embodied

658
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:04.668
cognition here. Oh, there is always a space

659
00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:07.938
for embodied cognition. It's a, it's a um

660
00:45:07.949 --> 00:45:14.679
it's a very interesting uh uh uh angle to look

661
00:45:14.688 --> 00:45:17.469
at how uh human cognition in general, like by

662
00:45:17.478 --> 00:45:21.369
you know, relating the mind and the brain to

663
00:45:21.378 --> 00:45:23.760
the rest of the body. This is absolutely interesting

664
00:45:23.769 --> 00:45:28.369
because as I said cognition doesn't happen in a vacuum

665
00:45:28.378 --> 00:45:30.889
. We are in a body and what happens to

666
00:45:30.898 --> 00:45:35.289
our body certainly affects our brain and our mind.

667
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.659
But uh I'm also, I also have a very

668
00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:42.599
critical view of embodied cognition because uh I think there

669
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.260
are a lot of things, a lot of representations

670
00:45:45.378 --> 00:45:51.360
that don't depend on motor experience on our experience are

671
00:45:51.369 --> 00:45:53.878
totally independent from the, from motor experience. And

672
00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:57.148
uh so sometimes I tend to be a little bit

673
00:45:57.159 --> 00:46:00.760
critical to the views that want to reduce the whole

674
00:46:00.769 --> 00:46:06.599
human cognition to motor experience. Mhm So now I

675
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.269
have a couple of questions that I think you've already

676
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.929
at least slightly touched on them earlier. But when

677
00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:20.418
it comes to social representations is the social entity itself

678
00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:25.878
as important as the relation that binds multiple entities together

679
00:46:28.083 --> 00:46:30.313
. So, yeah, um I think the relation

680
00:46:30.324 --> 00:46:34.135
is uh uh all that matters in uh in the

681
00:46:34.144 --> 00:46:37.773
social life uh in uh in for social cognition.

682
00:46:37.103 --> 00:46:42.563
And uh to the point that uh um when we

683
00:46:42.574 --> 00:46:45.375
see when we perceive a relation between the two social

684
00:46:45.385 --> 00:46:49.864
agents, between two people, uh we, the

685
00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:57.648
brain creates a whole new representation that uh has almost

686
00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:01.329
nothing to do with the two people itself. Like

687
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.409
what I mean? And we, we have,

688
00:47:04.418 --> 00:47:07.360
we have shown it uh uh really like empirically.

689
00:47:07.628 --> 00:47:13.128
So um when we see two objects, the neural

690
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:20.128
response to uh the two objects seen simultaneously is typically

691
00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:23.389
a linear combination of the response to the two single

692
00:47:23.398 --> 00:47:28.478
objects. So we can from, from the response

693
00:47:28.489 --> 00:47:31.599
to the two objects together, we can retrieve information

694
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:35.059
about the two single object. Because the, the

695
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.820
information about the two single object is maintained in the

696
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:44.438
representation of this composite representation that involves both objects.

697
00:47:44.449 --> 00:47:46.510
So if I see a pen and see if I

698
00:47:46.519 --> 00:47:50.039
see these two objects, and I measure the response

699
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.829
to this first in the brain. And then I

700
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.668
measure the response to this in the brain. And

701
00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:59.099
then I measure the response to them both presented together

702
00:48:00.289 --> 00:48:02.780
. This response is typically an average of some linear

703
00:48:02.789 --> 00:48:06.780
combination of the response to the two single objects.

704
00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:10.909
But now what we see is that uh when uh

705
00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:16.449
we see two people and these two people are represented

706
00:48:16.458 --> 00:48:21.099
in a social interaction, the response to these two

707
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.929
people is a non linear combination of the response to

708
00:48:23.938 --> 00:48:29.739
each individual body presented in isolation. And this non

709
00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.878
linear combination of the response to the individuals is an

710
00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:39.760
indication that the brain is building a new representation that

711
00:48:39.769 --> 00:48:45.378
has almost nothing to do with the individuals. And

712
00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:50.119
this new representation is basically the, the the the

713
00:48:50.128 --> 00:48:52.679
core input for the social cognition system. So yeah

714
00:48:52.688 --> 00:48:58.550
, the relation is perhaps more important than the individuals

715
00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:04.239
themselves. A and the relation is almost uh or

716
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:07.378
perhaps it is even a different entity or a different

717
00:49:07.389 --> 00:49:12.449
kind of representation than the two individual people. And

718
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:15.628
even the two individual people interacting with one another.

719
00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:19.188
I mean, it, it's a thing in and

720
00:49:19.199 --> 00:49:21.918
of itself. Right. Yes. Abso, that's

721
00:49:21.929 --> 00:49:23.159
, that's, again, that's, I was too

722
00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:27.550
uh enthusiastic in my. Yes. But uh that's

723
00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:30.599
my guess at the moment. Uh uh Yeah,

724
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:34.179
it's uh it's uh we have uh empirical data using

725
00:49:34.188 --> 00:49:40.378
F MRI using electroencephalography that uh um uh can isolate

726
00:49:40.389 --> 00:49:45.780
this integrative response that suggests that the brain is transforming

727
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:50.789
the input into into something that is a new thing

728
00:49:50.938 --> 00:49:52.469
that has nothing to do with the input itself.

729
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:57.269
And we have seen this signature of integration a lot

730
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.039
when it comes to the perception of interact, social

731
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.489
, interacting people. And when it comes to the

732
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.889
brain, do we know if there's actually visual specialization

733
00:50:07.898 --> 00:50:13.349
for diab human human interactions? I mean is there

734
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.369
a specialization for that specifically or not? Yeah,

735
00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:21.090
absolutely. As I said, we have recorded using

736
00:50:21.099 --> 00:50:22.809
F MRI, we have recorded from visual cortex,

737
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.579
from visual regions and we have seen that there are

738
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:30.302
some very similar active parts of the visual system that

739
00:50:30.311 --> 00:50:36.612
seems to like facing diets more than anything else.

740
00:50:36.922 --> 00:50:40.652
So this is already one signature of specialization we have

741
00:50:40.661 --> 00:50:45.152
seen even in behavioral task like if we present stimuli

742
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:51.632
around the perceptual threshold. So in very low visibility

743
00:50:51.641 --> 00:50:53.260
conditions, so we are used to do this experiment

744
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:58.454
to isolate the limits of visual perception. And so

745
00:50:58.463 --> 00:51:01.092
we present a stimuli, for instance, low contrast

746
00:51:01.103 --> 00:51:05.552
stimuli very rapidly to the subject and the subject have

747
00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.273
to report whether they have seen a stimulus or not

748
00:51:07.623 --> 00:51:12.204
. And we see that and this is one of

749
00:51:12.213 --> 00:51:16.043
the ways to measure the efficiency of in the perception

750
00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:20.512
of a given type of stimuli. And what we

751
00:51:20.523 --> 00:51:23.226
see is that again, when we present these facing

752
00:51:23.235 --> 00:51:27.416
bodies, the system is much faster. So the

753
00:51:27.425 --> 00:51:30.534
responses are much faster and much more accurate than when

754
00:51:30.545 --> 00:51:35.755
present bodies in isolation or in other kinds of special

755
00:51:35.766 --> 00:51:38.614
relations. So we have a behavioral, we have

756
00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:45.695
F MRI, we have ee electroencephalographic signature of that

757
00:51:45.706 --> 00:51:51.438
suggests that there is a visual specialization for uh fishing

758
00:51:51.449 --> 00:51:57.159
diets. And uh visual specialization means that uh we

759
00:51:57.168 --> 00:52:01.559
just have uh uh very efficient mechanisms to detect this

760
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.820
kind of configuration in the space. So for instance

761
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:08.418
, if I present subjects with very clot, the

762
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:14.059
rich and noisy visual scene that has a tool facing

763
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:17.139
people somewhere in this scene, we have seen that

764
00:52:17.148 --> 00:52:22.789
subjects immediately find these stimulus in the in the clutter

765
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.769
. And this is again another signature of the visual

766
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.079
efficiency. So earlier, we've talked about the kinds

767
00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:36.250
of cues that people process in looking at the social

768
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.648
scene and interpreting it as for example, when looking

769
00:52:38.659 --> 00:52:44.458
at the diet of people as interacting or non interacting

770
00:52:44.469 --> 00:52:49.289
. But how do we go from spatial relations between

771
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.159
people to uh perhaps trying to extract some information about

772
00:52:53.168 --> 00:52:57.989
the kind of relationship they have with one another and

773
00:52:58.019 --> 00:53:02.010
how much information can we extract from them uh about

774
00:53:02.019 --> 00:53:06.039
that. So, as I said, unfortunately,

775
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.978
I cannot give you an answer about how, because

776
00:53:08.989 --> 00:53:12.929
we are just at the beginning of this enterprise.

777
00:53:12.938 --> 00:53:15.309
So maybe in a few years, we'll be able

778
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.949
to know how we go from, you know,

779
00:53:16.958 --> 00:53:21.000
putting together. So the visual system knows that the

780
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.909
two people are face to face, they are closing

781
00:53:23.918 --> 00:53:28.894
space, they are touching each other, maybe uh

782
00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:31.503
they are, they have outstretched limbs toward each other

783
00:53:31.514 --> 00:53:34.583
. So they have all these features. So immediately

784
00:53:34.594 --> 00:53:38.704
the visual system um uh represents OK, this might

785
00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:44.425
be a social interaction. And so this information package

786
00:53:44.445 --> 00:53:46.304
is put is sent into the, you know,

787
00:53:46.313 --> 00:53:51.054
high level networks for social inference, the so called

788
00:53:51.063 --> 00:53:54.619
social brain network. And from here, how do

789
00:53:54.628 --> 00:54:00.090
we come to understand for instance that these two people

790
00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:06.539
are two lovers, for instance, or our two

791
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:12.119
enemies are competing? It's less clear what I can

792
00:54:12.128 --> 00:54:15.398
say is that again, we are very sensitive to

793
00:54:15.409 --> 00:54:21.255
small v in the spatial temporal patterns. So for

794
00:54:21.266 --> 00:54:24.465
instance, the way in which one object moves with

795
00:54:24.476 --> 00:54:30.824
respect to another can be immediately interpreted as having a

796
00:54:30.965 --> 00:54:36.425
positive or negative intention. So and you know,

797
00:54:36.436 --> 00:54:39.275
if you just a small acceleration in the movement of

798
00:54:39.284 --> 00:54:44.621
an object relative to another object can suggest that one

799
00:54:44.632 --> 00:54:47.572
is chasing the other or that the one. So

800
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:51.510
it's one that is chasing the other or that the

801
00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:55.081
other is escaping from the other like in small variation

802
00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:58.592
in the acceleration, for instance, can give a

803
00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:04.141
completely different cognitive representation, mental representation of what we

804
00:55:04.152 --> 00:55:08.739
see. But again, the computational uh machinery that

805
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:13.918
does this from, you know, seeing bodies faces

806
00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:19.800
facing each other, especially close to understand the the

807
00:55:19.809 --> 00:55:22.679
rich nature of a social interaction. That's really an

808
00:55:22.688 --> 00:55:28.030
open question. And do we have a good idea

809
00:55:28.039 --> 00:55:30.449
of what of what are the areas of the brain

810
00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:35.938
that are part of the network that that processes processes

811
00:55:35.949 --> 00:55:39.148
social information. Yeah, I mean, we do

812
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:44.510
. Um so definitely there is a uh an important

813
00:55:44.519 --> 00:55:46.340
contribution of visual areas. As I said, we

814
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:50.300
have been discussing this so far, like uh visual

815
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:52.909
areas, extract of a lot, a lot of

816
00:55:52.918 --> 00:55:58.958
of useful information for social inference. And um and

817
00:55:58.969 --> 00:56:02.289
uh I I'd say that uh because of the importance

818
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:07.059
of uh the social life from our survival, we

819
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.148
have developed a number of very efficient mechanisms to do

820
00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:15.320
so. So visual mechanism dedicated to uh extract the

821
00:56:15.329 --> 00:56:19.860
socially radical information. But then uh uh outside the

822
00:56:19.869 --> 00:56:22.539
the visual system, the visual system is just the

823
00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.898
entry of the information in the brain and outside of

824
00:56:25.909 --> 00:56:29.659
the visual information in the brain. But then outside

825
00:56:29.668 --> 00:56:30.688
the visual system, there, there is no one

826
00:56:30.699 --> 00:56:36.500
network, there are many networks that uh uh implement

827
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.039
processes that are relevant for uh social cognition. For

828
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:44.739
instance, the action understanding network is the network dedicated

829
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:47.813
it one and the action and what understanding and action

830
00:56:47.824 --> 00:56:53.454
means means, understand the goals and intentions of an

831
00:56:53.465 --> 00:56:58.293
action. There is uh the, the mind or

832
00:56:58.304 --> 00:57:00.724
the mentalis network, which is another set of regions

833
00:57:00.735 --> 00:57:05.195
that is dedicated to what we call mind reading,

834
00:57:05.204 --> 00:57:07.235
what's in another mind, what the others are thinking

835
00:57:07.244 --> 00:57:10.394
also, we are very good at that and we

836
00:57:10.405 --> 00:57:15.030
don't know how that happens. And um and uh

837
00:57:15.039 --> 00:57:17.458
uh then there is, of course, the semantic

838
00:57:17.469 --> 00:57:22.438
system, the conceptual system that represent all the knowledge

839
00:57:22.449 --> 00:57:25.039
that we have about the others. And in particular

840
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:29.849
, the social knowledge seems to be a very specific

841
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:35.070
type of knowledge that is represented probably in dedicated part

842
00:57:35.079 --> 00:57:37.949
of the larger semantic system. So yeah, uh

843
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:43.269
what we need to understand is really the specific computation

844
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.918
in each of these regions and also how the information

845
00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:51.519
travels within these networks and how this network uh networks

846
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.010
interact with each other. Let me just add the

847
00:57:53.019 --> 00:57:59.409
la last thing uh I talked a lot about visual

848
00:57:59.418 --> 00:58:01.909
information, socially relevant visual information because that's what I

849
00:58:01.918 --> 00:58:05.228
study. But you know, there is there,

850
00:58:05.239 --> 00:58:07.239
there is not just vision, there are other sensory

851
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:13.280
modalities and the other sensory modalities carry also a lot

852
00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:17.260
of relevant information for social cognition. Uh As we

853
00:58:17.269 --> 00:58:21.590
talked about briefly about the speech, the acoustic signal

854
00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:24.675
, there's nothing more social speech. And uh the

855
00:58:24.684 --> 00:58:30.554
smell is another um field that uh is um uh

856
00:58:30.563 --> 00:58:35.644
is is receiving a lot of attention uh because it's

857
00:58:35.655 --> 00:58:40.764
probably one of the fundamental uh uh foundations of it

858
00:58:40.773 --> 00:58:46.594
provides some foundations to uh social relationships. So it's

859
00:58:46.603 --> 00:58:49.543
um it's a, it's a long, it's gonna

860
00:58:49.554 --> 00:58:52.389
be a long way. Yeah, of course,

861
00:58:52.398 --> 00:58:55.219
it's important to mention that, that we here today

862
00:58:55.228 --> 00:59:01.559
were we were focusing on spatial relations and on visual

863
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:06.760
information because that's the main focus of your research.

864
00:59:06.769 --> 00:59:09.679
But of course, we do not only process visual

865
00:59:09.688 --> 00:59:15.849
information but also information from the other senses when interacting

866
00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.885
with other people. It's important to, to,

867
00:59:17.894 --> 00:59:21.625
to, to say so, so not just because

868
00:59:21.635 --> 00:59:23.394
it's fair for our colleagues who don't study vision,

869
00:59:23.456 --> 00:59:28.275
but also because uh vision is one of the most

870
00:59:28.284 --> 00:59:31.195
if not the most studied aspect of the human brain

871
00:59:31.585 --> 00:59:37.436
. Uh And some believe that vision is also the

872
00:59:37.445 --> 00:59:42.635
main sensory modality for humans. Uh Some agree,

873
00:59:42.644 --> 00:59:45.010
some don't agree with that, but it's true that

874
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:47.422
we are, we have a representation of the brain

875
00:59:47.431 --> 00:59:52.731
that is very much centered on visual processing. But

876
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.951
it's uh it's uh it's fair to acknowledge that,

877
00:59:54.960 --> 00:60:00.490
you know, there are other important modalities and in

878
00:60:00.501 --> 00:60:04.172
fields of research that needs to be acknowledged. Of

879
00:60:04.181 --> 00:60:07.541
course. So let's get into our last topic slash

880
00:60:07.552 --> 00:60:13.320
questions. So we've been focusing on humans here.

881
00:60:13.469 --> 00:60:16.360
But what about the nonhuman animals? Because I mean

882
00:60:16.369 --> 00:60:20.070
, we as people, I guess that we also

883
00:60:20.079 --> 00:60:25.000
look at the spatial relations, body configurations of other

884
00:60:25.010 --> 00:60:29.208
animals. And for example, there are some biped

885
00:60:29.648 --> 00:60:34.139
animals and some quadrupeds as well. So do we

886
00:60:34.148 --> 00:60:38.219
distinguish in specific ways between those two? And how

887
00:60:38.228 --> 00:60:42.059
does that work? Uh on the level of the

888
00:60:42.070 --> 00:60:45.188
brain neurologically? So there are two aspects of this

889
00:60:45.199 --> 00:60:47.679
research. I'm trying to answer them both. The

890
00:60:47.688 --> 00:60:52.530
first one is uh our perception of other animals that

891
00:60:52.539 --> 00:60:57.438
are nonhumans. Uh So, um uh the mechanism

892
00:60:57.449 --> 00:61:00.820
that I described the first general answer to the question

893
00:61:00.829 --> 00:61:04.168
is that all the mechanism that I described so far

894
00:61:04.309 --> 00:61:08.054
uh like this ability to process phases, biological motion

895
00:61:08.063 --> 00:61:12.264
bodies. So this is why I talk about faces

896
00:61:12.273 --> 00:61:16.353
, biological motion, bodies, bodies and not human

897
00:61:16.364 --> 00:61:20.824
bodies, not human faces, non human motion,

898
00:61:20.914 --> 00:61:24.184
because these especially individual cortex, the regions that cares

899
00:61:24.195 --> 00:61:29.054
about this, that care about this important aspect of

900
00:61:29.063 --> 00:61:32.760
the social life, recognizing faces, bodies, motion

901
00:61:34.128 --> 00:61:40.458
um operate over uh any animate entity. So they

902
00:61:40.469 --> 00:61:45.199
don't seem to care much whether a face is a

903
00:61:45.208 --> 00:61:47.909
human face or a monkey face. For instance,

904
00:61:47.918 --> 00:61:51.719
the fusiform face area, which is the region that

905
00:61:51.728 --> 00:61:55.195
responds to phases that has this very strong selective response

906
00:61:55.204 --> 00:62:00.534
to phases, doesn't show very reliable difference between a

907
00:62:00.543 --> 00:62:05.445
human face and a monkey phase or a cat phase

908
00:62:05.793 --> 00:62:09.514
. And the same is for the regions that process

909
00:62:09.523 --> 00:62:14.994
motion, they process biological motion. So any kind

910
00:62:15.003 --> 00:62:19.094
of motion that looks like the property of a biological

911
00:62:19.103 --> 00:62:24.050
motion relative to mechanic motion. But uh uh they

912
00:62:24.059 --> 00:62:28.469
don't have much uh you know, fine uh fine

913
00:62:28.478 --> 00:62:30.188
grain distinctions in terms of, you know, uh

914
00:62:30.199 --> 00:62:34.659
the the species that is uh moving, whether it's

915
00:62:34.668 --> 00:62:37.219
a human or not. So, you know,

916
00:62:37.228 --> 00:62:38.938
uh one line of research, we really asked the

917
00:62:38.949 --> 00:62:43.668
question, whether the visual system really doesn't help at

918
00:62:43.679 --> 00:62:46.250
all in the distinction between a human and nonhuman animals

919
00:62:46.260 --> 00:62:49.019
, which is very important us, I mean,

920
00:62:49.030 --> 00:62:52.688
we need to know whether and animating is a human

921
00:62:52.699 --> 00:62:57.530
is a conspecific or not. And we were very

922
00:62:57.539 --> 00:63:00.590
, I was very particularly surprised by the research on

923
00:63:00.599 --> 00:63:02.699
biological motion because it was a little bit confusing,

924
00:63:02.708 --> 00:63:07.688
like most of the field was talking about biological motion

925
00:63:07.780 --> 00:63:09.688
, but some authors were talking about, you know

926
00:63:09.699 --> 00:63:15.090
, these regions being tuned to human motion. So

927
00:63:15.099 --> 00:63:16.438
I wanted to see whether they are really tuned to

928
00:63:16.449 --> 00:63:20.519
human motion, which means that these regions are capable

929
00:63:20.530 --> 00:63:22.349
of distinguishing what is human from what is non human

930
00:63:22.570 --> 00:63:25.599
. Or in fact, they are picking up some

931
00:63:25.610 --> 00:63:30.519
feature in the motion that is typical of humans,

932
00:63:30.840 --> 00:63:34.914
but they don't really what is a human and what

933
00:63:34.925 --> 00:63:37.344
is a nonhuman thing. So the intuition, the

934
00:63:37.353 --> 00:63:38.715
idea that we had was OK, we can uh

935
00:63:38.724 --> 00:63:45.965
uh present videos of uh uh four kind of animate

936
00:63:45.974 --> 00:63:51.103
entities. A walking man, just a human who

937
00:63:51.114 --> 00:63:55.728
walks another human, a baby crawling uh cat,

938
00:63:57.099 --> 00:64:01.639
pa four legs crawling and uh a cat is a

939
00:64:01.648 --> 00:64:06.469
nonhuman which also walks uh uh with, with four

940
00:64:06.478 --> 00:64:12.269
legs and a cheek. A chika is a non

941
00:64:12.280 --> 00:64:15.989
human but like the prototypical human walks with two legs

942
00:64:16.260 --> 00:64:19.398
. So we wanted to see whether the regions in

943
00:64:19.409 --> 00:64:24.918
the visual cortex that care about motion could really distinguish

944
00:64:25.519 --> 00:64:28.478
human from no human. In which case we should

945
00:64:28.489 --> 00:64:30.168
, we should, we should see that response to

946
00:64:30.179 --> 00:64:34.000
the man and the baby is more similar than the

947
00:64:34.010 --> 00:64:39.539
response to the cat and the chicken or they are

948
00:64:39.550 --> 00:64:43.739
not really human uh preferring regions, but they actually

949
00:64:43.750 --> 00:64:45.139
only care about motion. And so what they can

950
00:64:45.148 --> 00:64:47.708
distinguish is the kind of motion and they don't care

951
00:64:47.719 --> 00:64:50.079
whether it's a human or nonhuman. And because there

952
00:64:50.090 --> 00:64:54.708
are these two big categories of motion, bipedal motion

953
00:64:54.719 --> 00:64:57.329
, which is typical of the human species, but

954
00:64:57.340 --> 00:65:00.780
not only of the human species and quadrupedal motion.

955
00:65:00.119 --> 00:65:04.364
We predicted that if these regions are only about the

956
00:65:04.375 --> 00:65:06.724
kind of motion, we should find that the response

957
00:65:06.735 --> 00:65:10.844
to the man is more similar to the response to

958
00:65:10.853 --> 00:65:14.425
the cheek because they are both bipedal and the response

959
00:65:14.434 --> 00:65:17.304
to the cat is more similar to the neural response

960
00:65:17.313 --> 00:65:20.324
to the baby because these are two quadrupeds, they

961
00:65:20.333 --> 00:65:24.934
are moving with four legs and this is exactly what

962
00:65:24.945 --> 00:65:28.375
we found. So this means that yes, what

963
00:65:28.385 --> 00:65:30.644
what this means is that yes, the visual system

964
00:65:31.175 --> 00:65:36.208
uh is capable of making distinctions a subtle distinction.

965
00:65:36.219 --> 00:65:39.099
In this case, in the type of motion,

966
00:65:39.579 --> 00:65:43.820
which might be useful then to distinguish what is a

967
00:65:43.829 --> 00:65:47.099
human from a nonhuman, but they are not yet

968
00:65:47.360 --> 00:65:53.500
representations of humanness, the visual system doesn't seem to

969
00:65:53.510 --> 00:65:59.659
care much about humanness, it cares about animated things

970
00:65:59.668 --> 00:66:05.628
, animals, whatever is a biological entity. Of

971
00:66:05.639 --> 00:66:09.289
course, you can find the differences. Uh for

972
00:66:09.300 --> 00:66:10.750
instance, uh because, you know, I don't

973
00:66:10.760 --> 00:66:13.289
wanna, you know, his colleagues to jump and

974
00:66:13.300 --> 00:66:15.110
say no, but uh also, you know,

975
00:66:15.119 --> 00:66:18.489
like uh the response to human faces, individual system

976
00:66:18.500 --> 00:66:21.728
is stronger. But then it becomes hard to know

977
00:66:21.739 --> 00:66:25.340
whether it is just an effect of familiarity because we

978
00:66:25.349 --> 00:66:28.500
see a lot of human faces and we have seen

979
00:66:28.510 --> 00:66:30.369
very few monkey faces in our life. So you

980
00:66:30.378 --> 00:66:33.579
can pick up this difference due to the familiarity of

981
00:66:33.590 --> 00:66:38.619
the stimulus to which the visual system is very sensitive

982
00:66:38.780 --> 00:66:42.628
. But it doesn't mean that uh uh intrinsically the

983
00:66:42.639 --> 00:66:45.708
visual system care about the human on human distinction.

984
00:66:45.599 --> 00:66:49.699
Uh And I guess that uh one very interesting thing

985
00:66:49.708 --> 00:66:55.300
about studying these, about the brain processes, information

986
00:66:55.309 --> 00:66:59.688
, I mean motion information and spatial uh uh and

987
00:66:59.699 --> 00:67:02.978
the information about the body and spatial relationship uh relations

988
00:67:02.989 --> 00:67:08.550
between humans and nonhumans is that this also might also

989
00:67:08.559 --> 00:67:13.820
inform us about if about whether specific areas of the

990
00:67:13.829 --> 00:67:18.646
brain specialized for processing human related information or if they

991
00:67:18.655 --> 00:67:25.786
are perhaps more domain general and they are specialized just

992
00:67:25.797 --> 00:67:30.206
for motion or for particular body configurations or something like

993
00:67:30.217 --> 00:67:32.606
that. Right. Yeah. So the kind of

994
00:67:32.615 --> 00:67:36.635
manipulation that I described where we manipulated the motion in

995
00:67:36.655 --> 00:67:42.164
the bipedal versus quadrupedal human versus non human is one

996
00:67:42.173 --> 00:67:45.012
example of the kind of manipulation that we do.

997
00:67:45.023 --> 00:67:46.664
And this is why it's fun to be an experimentalist

998
00:67:46.802 --> 00:67:48.963
because you know, we have the brain and the

999
00:67:48.974 --> 00:67:53.072
brain activity, but then we have to read the

1000
00:67:53.083 --> 00:67:55.713
information in that activity. So we can use this

1001
00:67:55.724 --> 00:67:58.302
kind of manipulation to see. OK, what's in

1002
00:67:58.313 --> 00:68:01.474
that activity? What's information in that activity is information

1003
00:68:01.483 --> 00:68:05.043
about the species a human versus non human is information

1004
00:68:05.052 --> 00:68:10.710
about uh uh motion. So by pedal versus quadrupedal

1005
00:68:10.949 --> 00:68:12.780
. And so in this way, exactly with this

1006
00:68:12.791 --> 00:68:15.189
manipulation, we found that in fact, these regions

1007
00:68:15.201 --> 00:68:18.680
in the visual cortex really care about motion. That's

1008
00:68:18.689 --> 00:68:21.939
all they care about. But there are other regions

1009
00:68:21.951 --> 00:68:28.319
in a higher level in higher order systems that uh

1010
00:68:28.331 --> 00:68:32.189
instead begin to make the distinction between a human and

1011
00:68:32.201 --> 00:68:36.081
a human because our cognition needs to make that distinction

1012
00:68:38.559 --> 00:68:41.738
. Great. So, uh Doctor Pape, just

1013
00:68:41.748 --> 00:68:44.257
before we go, would you like to tell people

1014
00:68:44.269 --> 00:68:45.998
where they can find you and your work on the

1015
00:68:46.007 --> 00:68:49.869
internet? Yes. So I have a website,

1016
00:68:49.878 --> 00:68:55.600
a personal website uh uh V uh uh sorry dot

1017
00:68:55.609 --> 00:68:58.989
I'm learning French. So it's like that's OK.

1018
00:68:59.930 --> 00:69:02.329
It's, it's terrible. So VVV uh dot Lua

1019
