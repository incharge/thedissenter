00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.500
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.368
And today I'm joined by Doctor Nicola Rayani. She

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.288
is Professor of Evolution and Behavior at Univer at University

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.609
College London. Her research considers the evolution of cooper

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.679
operation in nature. She was elected Fellow of the

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.559
Royal Society of Biology in 2019. And we're going

8
00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:27.039
to talk today about her first book, The Social

9
00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.888
Instinct How co-operation Shaped the world. So Nicola,

10
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.000
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone

11
00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.740
. Thanks very much for the invite. And uh

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.359
yeah, I've been looking forward to joining you.

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.520
OK, great. So let me first ask you

14
00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:46.048
since this is a book basically about uh our societies

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.740
evolved about sociality. Why do you begin the book

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.298
by going all the way down to the cellular level

17
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.728
? Well, I think it's kind of interesting to

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.598
start there because the book has the book has a

19
00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.609
very obvious structure. So it starts very small,

20
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.219
thinking about co-operation that uh happens inside the bodies of

21
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.579
multicellular organisms. And then it in each part of

22
00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.338
the book, I zoom out a level and think

23
00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:18.620
about the evolution of families and then the evolution of

24
00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.879
co-operation beyond the family group. And finally, in

25
00:01:21.888 --> 00:01:23.778
the last part of the book, I talk about

26
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.638
the evolution of societies and large scale co-operation. Um

27
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.939
The reason that I wanted to have that structure is

28
00:01:30.948 --> 00:01:34.909
that I think um for people who maybe don't know

29
00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:38.808
a lot about cooper operation or who haven't, you

30
00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.808
know, studied it in much detail. It would

31
00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.159
be quite easy to assume that cooper operation was just

32
00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.969
something that happens between individuals. So it's some kind

33
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.308
of behavior that you see individuals doing and that's observable

34
00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.359
in some way in the real world. Uh And

35
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.510
I don't think it's as widely appreciated that actually every

36
00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:07.270
multicellular being on earth, every living multicellular organism,

37
00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:09.899
whether it's a plant or an animal or, or

38
00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:16.110
a fungi is actually created through co-operation and it's created

39
00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:22.909
through genes cooperating with one another and cells cooperating with

40
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.088
one another to um form this collective that we call

41
00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.868
an organism or an individual. And the reason that

42
00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.250
I wanted to uh have this structure and to think

43
00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.500
about this sort of this, this cooper operation at

44
00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:38.008
these, the lowest levels if you like at the

45
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.830
lowest levels of organization is because it helps, it

46
00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:46.189
helps us to realize as we move through the book

47
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.580
, these very general principles that underpin co-operation at all

48
00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.879
levels of life, whether we're talking about genes cooperating

49
00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.610
inside bodies or ants cooperating inside a a colony or

50
00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:05.050
people cooperating inside a society. There are some kind

51
00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:08.300
of fundamental general principles that emerge at all these levels

52
00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.588
of life. And that's why I wanted to start

53
00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.460
with this perspective of the understanding the individual as a

54
00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.949
feat of cooper operation. Um to try to bring

55
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.429
out those commonalities and to surprise people in a way

56
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.419
, right? And why do you decide to focus

57
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.629
on cooper operation? Because for example, we could

58
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.550
also have focused on competition. So why cooper?

59
00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:39.278
Well, for me, co-operation and competition are two

60
00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:43.389
sides of the same coin. Um So in,

61
00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.508
I think one of the big misunderstandings in some ways

62
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.830
about the selfish gene, the book by Richard Dawkins

63
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:53.169
, which is 45 years old now is that it

64
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:58.099
predicts is that selfish genes would predict selfish behavior and

65
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.750
that we would only find selfish genes inside the bodies

66
00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:05.550
of the most selfish or uh nefarious individuals. And

67
00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:09.729
in fact that has been that is a misconception and

68
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.469
continues to be a misconception of what that gene eye's

69
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.959
view perspective of evolution is about. And Dawkins himself

70
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.923
noted in his book that in many ways, the

71
00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:25.134
most effective ways for a gene to ensure that copies

72
00:04:25.144 --> 00:04:28.355
of itself find their way into future generations is to

73
00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:30.444
co-operate. And through this lens, we can see

74
00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:35.394
that co-operation is often a selfish or a self interested

75
00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:40.629
strategy. And so for me, I see focusing

76
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.889
on co-operation is in some ways, it just depends

77
00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.379
how you want to view it, you can view

78
00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.269
cooper operation as being a form of competition if you

79
00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:50.629
like, even though people don't often think of it

80
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.579
that way. So I wouldn't necessarily say that my

81
00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:58.399
book is only about cooper operation. It's about how

82
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.069
cooper operation is often an effective way to compete or

83
00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.649
to prosper. So when trying to understand the evolution

84
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.189
of human co-operation, what would be the best uh

85
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.369
models? I mean, in terms of other species

86
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.309
to, to which we should compare humans? I

87
00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.858
mean, would it be the most closely related to

88
00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:27.178
us, the other great apes or others? So

89
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.540
I think this is a really interesting question and this

90
00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:30.949
is one, this kind of question is one that's

91
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.178
actually underwritten lots of my own academic research because many

92
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.970
of the species that I've worked on outside of my

93
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.220
research on humans have been species that not only are

94
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.790
not very closely related to us on the tree of

95
00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:48.678
life, but they're species that people probably have never

96
00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.160
even heard of. So things like a pied babbler

97
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.869
, which is a bird that lives in family groups

98
00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.350
in, in the Kalahari desert or the cleaner fish

99
00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.189
, which is a fish that lives on coral reefs

100
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.019
in the in throughout the Indo Pacific. And one

101
00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:10.619
of the general um underlying themes of the research that

102
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.619
I've done when I've compared the behavior of nonhuman species

103
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.420
with what we see in humans and in particular,

104
00:06:17.428 --> 00:06:21.819
the social behavior and the co-operative behavior is that often

105
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:27.250
we can find striking similarities in the kinds of behavioral

106
00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.869
outcomes that are achieved by humans and by quite distantly

107
00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:35.329
related species like meerkats and hide babblers and cleaner fish

108
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.329
. Even though we don't, we're not closely related

109
00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:43.250
to these species. Uh And one of the key

110
00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.119
points in some ways is this idea that often we

111
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.689
might get to the same behavioral destination as another species

112
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.269
. So to give an example, one of the

113
00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.230
behaviors that humans are famous for is teaching and we

114
00:06:57.238 --> 00:06:59.519
tend to think of teaching as being, you know

115
00:06:59.528 --> 00:07:02.778
, a quintessentially human activity. Um And when we

116
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.470
, when people started looking for examples of teaching in

117
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.600
the animal world, in the nonhuman world, they

118
00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:13.470
instinctively looked for it first in species like chimpanzees and

119
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.439
gorillas and the other great apes. But we didn't

120
00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.619
find those examples of teaching in those species. And

121
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:21.059
in fact, the first species where we found an

122
00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:25.420
example of teaching was an ant. And the second

123
00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:27.980
example was a meerkat. And so, and the

124
00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:30.100
third example actually was a work that I did,

125
00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:32.178
which was on pied babblers. One of the really

126
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.290
interesting things. And one of the main messages in

127
00:07:34.298 --> 00:07:40.259
my book is that often we can find that humans

128
00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:44.838
and nonhuman species can get to the same behavioral destination

129
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.660
. So we see these commonalities, for example,

130
00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.358
in the fact that we teach, but so do

131
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:53.319
meerkats and so do ants and so do pried babblers

132
00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:57.199
, but we get there via a quite different cognitive

133
00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:00.309
journey to these other species. And so the kind

134
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.369
of cognition that supports teaching in humans probably involves the

135
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:09.209
ability to understand what a pupil knows some kind of

136
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.600
mind reading or what psychologists call theory of mind.

137
00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:16.369
Whereas in species like ants and babblers and meerkats,

138
00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:18.358
we don't think there's that sort of cognition is happening

139
00:08:18.369 --> 00:08:22.730
at all to facilitate teaching. And instead the teaching

140
00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:28.189
behavior is achieved by our different cognitive route. And

141
00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:31.629
so I think often we can find similarities in the

142
00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.869
behavior we observe between humans and other species in the

143
00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:39.408
behavioral outcomes. And we ought to look for similarities

144
00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:43.869
and behavioral outcomes where the ecology is likely to favor

145
00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:46.658
those kinds of behaviors. And that won't always be

146
00:08:46.668 --> 00:08:50.469
in our closest living relatives that won't always be in

147
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.048
species like the chimpanzees and the other great apes.

148
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.538
But even when we do find those behavioral similarities,

149
00:08:56.908 --> 00:09:00.489
what we then also have to ask is, well

150
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.168
, how does the cognition supporting those behaviors differ?

151
00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:05.288
And that's really where I think we start to see

152
00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:09.960
points of divergence between humans and other species, which

153
00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:11.609
is not so much what we do. But it's

154
00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.139
a, it's about how we do it and it's

155
00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.048
about how we get there cognitively. So when talking

156
00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:22.769
about the evolution of co-operation, particularly with evolutionary biologists

157
00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.658
, people bring to the table evolved mechanisms like kin

158
00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:33.469
selection, reciprocal altruism group selection even so Uh I

159
00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:35.979
I mean, do you think that any one of

160
00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:41.500
these is uh enough to explain the evolution of co-operation

161
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:45.859
or should we unders try to understand different aspects of

162
00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:50.788
co-operation uh how they evolve via one of these evolved

163
00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:56.450
mechanisms? And I mean, particularly group selection because

164
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.649
that's a very controversial topic among evolutionary biologists. I

165
00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:03.428
mean, what do you think about it? So

166
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.928
I think there is this sort of pervasive assumption in

167
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.908
a lot of the human evolution literature that the two

168
00:10:09.918 --> 00:10:16.149
key mechanisms that support co-operation are either kin selection,

169
00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:18.830
meaning just that you help your relatives because you share

170
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.940
copies of their genes. And that's another way to

171
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:24.445
get copies of your genes into the next generation or

172
00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:28.923
it's reciprocal altruism. And there is a kind of

173
00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:30.724
, there has been at least an assumption in the

174
00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:33.695
literature that if you can't explain co-operation, either with

175
00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:37.043
kin selection or with reciprocal altruism, then we should

176
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.484
, then we should bring in group selection as the

177
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:43.033
alternative explanation. And I don't, I don't fully

178
00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.335
subscribe to that view. So I think that kin

179
00:10:46.344 --> 00:10:52.389
selection is probably the most important mechanism for explaining the

180
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.288
breadth of co-operation that we see on earth. So

181
00:10:54.298 --> 00:10:58.580
most of the co-operation we see in um humans but

182
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.190
also in nonhuman species occurs within the confines of family

183
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.519
groups. And there is no coincidence that we see

184
00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:11.769
co-operation in families because there's just a much bigger incentive

185
00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.529
to help individuals who share copies of the, the

186
00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:16.590
same genes that you have. And so if you

187
00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:20.399
were going to say which which of these evolutionary mechanisms

188
00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:24.190
has the most potential for explaining most cases of co-operation

189
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.649
that we see on earth. I think in selection

190
00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:30.710
probably explains most of the examples we see particularly in

191
00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:35.710
nonhuman species. But when we look at between unrelated

192
00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:39.678
individuals where we know that kin selection can't be at

193
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.009
work. I think it's very short sighted to assume

194
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:46.979
that the only other mechanism at our disposal to explain

195
00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:50.149
this co-operation is reciprocal altruism. And we know that

196
00:11:50.158 --> 00:11:54.548
there are many, many mechanisms that can support co-operation

197
00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:58.668
between non relatives, um things like punishment and um

198
00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:03.678
reputation based partner of choice or concern for reputation.

199
00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:05.798
And so I don't think we necessarily have to reflexively

200
00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:11.029
decide that it's either con selection or it's reciprocal altruism

201
00:12:11.158 --> 00:12:15.859
or else let's bring in group selection. Um So

202
00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:18.349
I think there are multiple mechanisms that are really important

203
00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:24.710
for understanding how co-operation evolves. Um Interdependence is arguably

204
00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:26.840
even more important than reciprocal altruism in a lot of

205
00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:31.038
cases where individuals have a stake in one another's fitness

206
00:12:31.048 --> 00:12:35.658
. And so they're incentivized to help their interaction partners

207
00:12:35.668 --> 00:12:39.700
, even if there's no uh no scope for repayment

208
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.149
from those partners. I think now we there are

209
00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.609
lots of mechanisms we know about that can support cooper

210
00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:48.460
operation and group selection is just one of those and

211
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:52.719
arguably the least parsimonious given what we know about how

212
00:12:52.729 --> 00:13:00.548
evolution works and what are families from an evolutionary perspective

213
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.080
? So a family, I think a family is

214
00:13:05.408 --> 00:13:07.899
a special kind of social group. So it's a

215
00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:16.200
stable social group, um obviously usually comprised of genealogical

216
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.440
relatives. Um In our own case, I think

217
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.279
we tend to think of families as being nuclear families

218
00:13:22.288 --> 00:13:26.979
, mum, dad and the kids. Um but

219
00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:28.960
in fact, nuclear families are a bit of an

220
00:13:28.969 --> 00:13:31.195
outlier for in, in nature, but also in

221
00:13:31.205 --> 00:13:33.413
our own species. The nuclear family is a bit

222
00:13:33.423 --> 00:13:37.075
of an outlier when you consider our long history on

223
00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:41.224
this planet. And also if you think outside of

224
00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:43.565
the western model of society and look more broadly at

225
00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:48.705
other cultures, the western model of the nuclear family

226
00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:52.460
is really quite unusual and where we see family life

227
00:13:52.469 --> 00:13:56.739
in humans, but also in other species, which

228
00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.830
are often called co-operative breeders, family tends to be

229
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.590
based on a more extended notion of family. So

230
00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:07.700
you often have um a breeding pair or the mother

231
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.859
and father and then several other individuals, relatives who

232
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:15.830
might live in the same stable social group and might

233
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.879
all contribute to raising offspring within that group. So

234
00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:24.519
since you mentioned the nuclear family, and because this

235
00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:30.509
ties back to questions that people nowadays are discussing particularly

236
00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:33.759
in politics about the role that the nuclear family plays

237
00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:35.759
and how important it is. I mean, since

238
00:14:35.769 --> 00:14:39.500
we have such high degrees of cooper breathing, particularly

239
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:43.820
looking cross culturally and back in time, I mean

240
00:14:45.168 --> 00:14:48.279
, uh I is it really that important for Children

241
00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:52.739
to have at home, both a mother and a

242
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.129
father or, I mean, is it at least

243
00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:58.158
one of them essential or could, can they be

244
00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:01.298
replaced by other people or other? I mean,

245
00:15:01.308 --> 00:15:05.038
family and perhaps friends and perhaps even in the case

246
00:15:05.048 --> 00:15:09.000
of, of modern societies, other people from certain

247
00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:13.538
institutions. So I think this is one question which

248
00:15:13.548 --> 00:15:18.440
has been massively thrown into sharp relief by the pandemic

249
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.879
that we're currently experiencing. And for anyone like me

250
00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:26.399
who has, who lives in a western nuclear family

251
00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.719
, where you have a mum and dad and Children

252
00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:33.219
at home, the experience of having school closures and

253
00:15:33.229 --> 00:15:37.889
the usual um sources of help, the way that

254
00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:43.009
we outsource our childcare to these institutionalized um forms of

255
00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:46.048
childcare has really exposed just how dependent we are on

256
00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:50.019
help to in order to be able to successfully raise

257
00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:52.418
offspring. And I think this is a, there

258
00:15:52.428 --> 00:15:54.250
is a more general point here like you said,

259
00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:58.817
which is that there is an ideology and it is

260
00:15:58.826 --> 00:16:03.586
an ideology in the West that the mother is the

261
00:16:03.636 --> 00:16:07.655
, she ought to be the exclusive caregiver for her

262
00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:10.996
offspring and is the irreplaceable caregiver for her offspring.

263
00:16:11.206 --> 00:16:14.136
And that if a mother, for example, outsources

264
00:16:14.145 --> 00:16:17.586
that childcare by sending her child to nursery when they're

265
00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.956
too young or, or outsourcing it to other forms

266
00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:23.143
of, of institutionalized child, then she might be

267
00:16:23.153 --> 00:16:26.692
wreaking some kind of emotional damage or harm onto her

268
00:16:26.702 --> 00:16:30.874
child. And I think that that view is pernicious

269
00:16:30.903 --> 00:16:36.114
, not just because it enforces a patriarchal norm of

270
00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:37.582
women staying at home to look after Children and,

271
00:16:37.592 --> 00:16:40.822
and, and these things, but because it actually

272
00:16:40.832 --> 00:16:45.722
has no bearing on what we know about the reality

273
00:16:45.734 --> 00:16:48.221
of how humans evolved, which is that we evolved

274
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.240
in extended family groups where Children would have been raised

275
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.440
by many, many different individuals and not just by

276
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.320
the mother. And often not even the mother would

277
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.960
not even have been necessarily the primary caregiver. Um

278
00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:04.519
For a lot of the time Children would have been

279
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.970
raised by their older siblings, by their grandparents,

280
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.780
by various other adults in around aunts, uncles and

281
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.289
so on. Um And this idea that Children need

282
00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:21.390
to form this bond with one individual in order to

283
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.709
develop a secure attachment and that if that is somehow

284
00:17:23.719 --> 00:17:26.049
disrupted, that the child will go on to have

285
00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:32.828
emotional and behavioral problems, really has no empirical support

286
00:17:32.838 --> 00:17:34.420
. And also is just not in keeping with our

287
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.189
view of with our, our understanding of how humans

288
00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:41.358
evolved. And the fact that Children have always grown

289
00:17:41.368 --> 00:17:45.318
up being looked after by multiple different caregivers. Um

290
00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:48.799
And the reason we probably don't, we have the

291
00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:49.838
, we're able to have these nuclear families or we're

292
00:17:49.848 --> 00:17:52.578
able to persist in these nuclear families in the West

293
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:56.259
is that we outsource that childcare nowadays to these various

294
00:17:56.269 --> 00:17:59.559
institutions. And that's how, you know, that's

295
00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:00.598
we out, we send our Children to school,

296
00:18:02.174 --> 00:18:03.564
you know, things like this. So I think

297
00:18:03.574 --> 00:18:07.114
it's in some ways, one of the messages in

298
00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:08.384
the book that I write in in the chapter on

299
00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:12.354
childcare is that the an evolutionary perspective would suggest that

300
00:18:12.364 --> 00:18:15.265
it's completely fine to send your Children to daycare.

301
00:18:15.275 --> 00:18:18.765
That's a, a very normal situation for a young

302
00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:22.275
human child to be immersed in, to be surrounded

303
00:18:22.285 --> 00:18:26.045
by other Children and to be looked after by multiple

304
00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:30.299
different caregivers, not just the mother. So another

305
00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:36.390
question since we have so much cooperating co-operative breeding in

306
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.338
humans and in the case of men, uh we

307
00:18:41.348 --> 00:18:45.469
have paternity, uncertainty. Why is it that paternal

308
00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:49.269
investment in humans evolved? I mean, I I'm

309
00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:55.309
asking you that also because many times people say,

310
00:18:55.318 --> 00:18:57.009
and I'm not completely sure if this is true that

311
00:18:57.279 --> 00:19:03.779
in comparing to other species, human males are sort

312
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:07.828
of outliers in how much they invest in their Children

313
00:19:07.858 --> 00:19:11.680
. So you're right that humans are a bit unusual

314
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:15.160
as far as mammals go in, that males are

315
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.799
involved often in helping to raise the offspring. That's

316
00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:21.519
not a human, that's not a universal. So

317
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:25.750
there is some cross cultural variation in how involved fathers

318
00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:29.670
are with raising their offspring and sometimes sometimes fathers aren't

319
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.108
really involved at all. There are some societies like

320
00:19:32.118 --> 00:19:33.759
the Da Toga in Tanzania where men are really not

321
00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:37.400
involved at all in raising their offspring. And there

322
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.348
are other societies um like for example, the,

323
00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:45.229
the matrilineal society called the um Mosi society in China

324
00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:49.098
, where men actually have much more to do with

325
00:19:49.108 --> 00:19:52.029
their sister's Children than they do with their own Children

326
00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:55.160
. So they're much more involved in raising their nieces

327
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.328
and nephews than they are in raising their own um

328
00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:00.969
offspring. So it's not a hu it's not a

329
00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:03.243
universal, but there is a general pattern that,

330
00:20:03.255 --> 00:20:08.844
that human males are typically more involved in raising offspring

331
00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:12.354
than the average male mammal is. Um and you

332
00:20:12.364 --> 00:20:17.805
mentioned paternity uncertainty. And I think for humans actually

333
00:20:17.814 --> 00:20:19.814
, as far as uh again in relation to other

334
00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:25.723
mammal species, paternity uncertainty for humans is typically relatively

335
00:20:25.733 --> 00:20:29.259
low. So our best evidence, even though it's

336
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:33.650
very difficult to be certain, indicates that humans probably

337
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:40.108
evolved um to uh uh to be socially and sexually

338
00:20:40.118 --> 00:20:45.189
monogamous females probably weren't mating with multiple males at the

339
00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:48.088
same time. And we can infer this based on

340
00:20:48.098 --> 00:20:49.920
looking at things like relative, the size of the

341
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:55.733
testicles relative to the body size in humans and other

342
00:20:55.743 --> 00:20:59.733
ape species. The idea being that if females are

343
00:20:59.743 --> 00:21:02.594
what we call promiscuous in that they mate with multiple

344
00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:06.324
males, um during a single Easter cycle, males

345
00:21:06.334 --> 00:21:07.894
ought to grow bigger balls because they need to produce

346
00:21:07.904 --> 00:21:11.755
more sperm to be able to compete in sperm competition

347
00:21:11.765 --> 00:21:15.568
with other males. Human males, uh their rela

348
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.500
their testy size relative to their body size is much

349
00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:22.750
closer to what we would expect. Um if humans

350
00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:26.799
mating system as ancestrally was more at the monogamous end

351
00:21:26.809 --> 00:21:29.848
of the scale. And that implies that a relatively

352
00:21:29.858 --> 00:21:33.969
high degree of paternity certainty in humans compared to something

353
00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:36.769
like a chimpanzee, where females are much more promiscuous

354
00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:38.939
and do mate with many males in the group um

355
00:21:38.949 --> 00:21:42.578
within a single Easter cycle. Uh And so,

356
00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:45.670
I think, um in part, we can understand

357
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.259
this evolution of paternal care through this, through there

358
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:52.969
being an increased certainty for human males that, that

359
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.910
, that Children that they raise with their um opposite

360
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:03.250
sex partner are theirs. Um And also the fact

361
00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:07.039
that humans evolved in much more difficult environments than the

362
00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:08.799
environments that are characterized by, by the great apes

363
00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:14.299
that are alive today. And mothers really needed help

364
00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:17.390
in the production of young, they needed help from

365
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.818
fathers and other family members if they were going to

366
00:22:19.828 --> 00:22:22.750
be able to successfully raise young. And that's another

367
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:29.189
really important reason why we see paternal investment in humans

368
00:22:29.199 --> 00:22:32.088
and not so much in the other great ape species

369
00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:34.449
where mothers are much more able to raise offspring without

370
00:22:34.459 --> 00:22:40.348
assistance from other individuals. Mhm. So I've already

371
00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:42.868
talked several times about grandmothers on the show. So

372
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.029
I would like to ask you specifically about this since

373
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.640
as far as we know, it was women who

374
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:55.838
tended to move to their husband's household when they married

375
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.818
. I mean, why is it that it is

376
00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:03.469
maternal grandmothers that tend to invest more in their grandchildren

377
00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:07.900
than paternal grandmothers and not the other way around considering

378
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.019
that then the Children would be living in their father's

379
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:15.358
household. Yeah, that's, that's a really interesting

380
00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:17.469
question. And it's one that when, when I

381
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:22.338
first started to learn about these uh reproductive conflicts that

382
00:23:22.348 --> 00:23:25.400
prompted the evolution of menopause. That was a question

383
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.299
that I also had as well because in some ways

384
00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:30.699
, you, your default assumption is that the younger

385
00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:37.000
female has moved to live with the husband's uh family

386
00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:40.535
. And so the nearest available grandmother to help is

387
00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:41.775
gonna be the paternal grandmother. So why isn't she

388
00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:47.134
, why are paternal grandmothers less decisive for the survival

389
00:23:47.144 --> 00:23:49.733
of offspring and for the fecundity of females than maternal

390
00:23:49.743 --> 00:23:53.684
grandmothers? Um And it I asked Mike Can about

391
00:23:53.693 --> 00:23:56.824
this. He is the guy who he's one of

392
00:23:56.834 --> 00:24:00.125
the evolutionary biologists who has been very heavily involved in

393
00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:03.015
developing the theoretical models on the evolution of menopause.

394
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:06.604
And he, his, he, his view was

395
00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:10.689
that the model is correct. We fe we do

396
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:14.229
see female bias dispersal such that females are moving to

397
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:18.809
live with their husband's family and they're in closer proximity

398
00:24:18.818 --> 00:24:22.088
to their mother-in-law than they are to their own mother

399
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:23.588
. But as long as they don't move too far

400
00:24:23.598 --> 00:24:26.420
away, as long as that dispersal distance isn't too

401
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.348
far, then the maternal grandmother can still can still

402
00:24:30.358 --> 00:24:33.848
manage to help her daughter um in rai with raising

403
00:24:33.858 --> 00:24:37.759
offspring and anything that that entails. And so I

404
00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:38.920
think in my mind, at least I'd kind of

405
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.759
always assumed that this dispersal was happening over a really

406
00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:44.920
vast distance. And so, you know, you're

407
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:45.880
leaving home and that's it, you're never gonna see

408
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.689
them again. But I think probably the dis the

409
00:24:48.699 --> 00:24:52.674
distances that we're talking about are not as prohibitive for

410
00:24:52.684 --> 00:24:56.265
allowing maternal grandmothers to still be involved in helping their

411
00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:59.795
daughters to raise young. And in fact, there

412
00:24:59.805 --> 00:25:02.354
are some data showing that when the distance moved by

413
00:25:02.364 --> 00:25:04.614
the younger female is far enough such that their,

414
00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:08.233
their mother can no longer help, then they,

415
00:25:08.243 --> 00:25:12.104
they actually experience reduced bund and reduced survival of their

416
00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:15.213
offspring because they don't have that assistance from their own

417
00:25:15.223 --> 00:25:19.939
mothers in producing young. Yeah, it's interesting.

418
00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:22.660
I also have that idea that when they moved,

419
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.239
it was so far away that perhaps maternal grandmothers wouldn't

420
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.420
be able to help there. And I was even

421
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.160
asking myself if we could talk about male fill of

422
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.029
pater in humans, but perhaps not. I think

423
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.299
we don't, I think basically, uh I'm not

424
00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:45.430
an expert in this but the, as far as

425
00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:48.439
we know, um I think our best estimates are

426
00:25:48.449 --> 00:25:52.180
that dispersal in ancestral human populations was female biased.

427
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.920
And so, and I think the, the models

428
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.588
of the evolution of menopause and the reproductive conflicts and

429
00:25:59.598 --> 00:26:03.608
how those are resolved through relatedness, asymmetries between uh

430
00:26:03.618 --> 00:26:07.529
the paternal mother in law, the paternal grandmother and

431
00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:12.289
the younger female makes sense under this framework of female

432
00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:17.729
biased dispersal. So I think that, um I

433
00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:18.420
guess, I don't know, maybe new data will

434
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.750
come and things will be overturned. But my,

435
00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:23.108
I, at the moment, I sort of accept

436
00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:29.299
this consensus that the dispersal in ancestral human populations was

437
00:26:29.309 --> 00:26:33.519
female biased. Right. So, I mean,

438
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:36.789
but, but in the case of grandfathers, do

439
00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:40.670
they play any role whatsoever? Why is it that

440
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.739
men have also such long lifespans on average? So

441
00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:51.088
there's um an evolutionary demographer called Rebecca Seer, who's

442
00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:56.410
done lots of work on um who keeps Children alive

443
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.318
. That's the title of one of her papers who

444
00:26:57.328 --> 00:27:02.549
keeps Children alive and based on meta analysis of lots

445
00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.818
of different studies, um as you might expect the

446
00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:08.309
most important person for keeping Children alive in the first

447
00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:11.539
years of life is the mother, fathers have a

448
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:15.750
much less decisive role to play in the survival of

449
00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:18.199
their offspring. The presence of a maternal grandmother often

450
00:27:18.209 --> 00:27:22.650
has a positive effect, but the presence of grandfathers

451
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.809
is really not decisive at all for keeping Children alive

452
00:27:26.818 --> 00:27:30.769
. And so the inference um from these, from

453
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:36.650
these studies is that grandfathers aren't really doing that much

454
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.068
. Um at least in these um in these studies

455
00:27:40.078 --> 00:27:41.789
for which we have data, grandfathers aren't doing that

456
00:27:41.799 --> 00:27:45.942
much to keep their grandchildren alive, to improve the

457
00:27:45.952 --> 00:27:49.422
survival of their, of their grandchildren. And so

458
00:27:49.432 --> 00:27:52.603
yes, there is a, a question of why

459
00:27:52.613 --> 00:27:55.633
do you know, why do men get to then

460
00:27:55.642 --> 00:27:57.031
have this extended lifespan? And I think one of

461
00:27:57.041 --> 00:28:00.672
the most obvious answers that I've seen uh that makes

462
00:28:00.682 --> 00:28:04.502
sense is that a man can still continue to accrue

463
00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:10.281
reproductive success quite late into his life. Um And

464
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.576
without a substantial amount of investment, unlike, unlike

465
00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:15.036
women who have to, you know, get pregnant

466
00:28:15.046 --> 00:28:18.806
and just stay a baby and then um lactate after

467
00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:22.296
the baby is born, the investment involved for a

468
00:28:22.306 --> 00:28:25.474
male is much, much less. And so it

469
00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:27.905
could, it can simply be like these opportunities to

470
00:28:27.994 --> 00:28:33.175
continue to accrue reproductive success, can help to select

471
00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:36.724
um for a long lifespan in men as well as

472
00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:41.670
in women. Mhm. So moving from families,

473
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.910
why is it that it is so common from for

474
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:51.449
humans to help others they are unrelated to? So

475
00:28:51.949 --> 00:28:52.279
, yeah, I mean, this is a really

476
00:28:52.289 --> 00:28:56.068
big question and I guess whenever we ask a why

477
00:28:56.078 --> 00:29:00.279
question in evolutionary biology, we have to always recognize

478
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:03.680
that there are two different, broadly speaking, two

479
00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:06.828
different kinds of explanation that we could offer. So

480
00:29:06.838 --> 00:29:07.949
, on the one hand, we can offer what

481
00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:12.068
we call proximate level explanations and they're simply concerned with

482
00:29:12.088 --> 00:29:15.910
how the behavior comes about what the motives are or

483
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:22.068
the maybe the physiological mechanisms that bring that behavior about

484
00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:23.779
. And we can also ask um what we call

485
00:29:23.809 --> 00:29:26.189
um Well, sorry, we can also provide what

486
00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:30.219
we call ultimate level explanations. And those are more

487
00:29:30.229 --> 00:29:33.680
concerned with the evolutionary significance of the behavior. And

488
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:37.630
so when we ask why humans help strangers, if

489
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.160
we were to offer proximate level explanations, we might

490
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.828
be in the realm of thinking about things like warm

491
00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:45.680
glow, it feels good to help other people,

492
00:29:45.689 --> 00:29:48.318
or maybe we have a norm, psychology. And

493
00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:51.338
in the society that we live in, there's a

494
00:29:51.348 --> 00:29:53.750
norm which dictates that you ought to help, you

495
00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:56.358
know, help people if you can, even if

496
00:29:56.368 --> 00:29:59.588
you don't know them. Um There, there are

497
00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:03.479
a bunch of um proximate level explanations that you could

498
00:30:03.489 --> 00:30:06.479
offer to explain why people might help others. And

499
00:30:06.489 --> 00:30:07.380
I really don't think it's as simple as saying,

500
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.059
here's the reason there are, there are maybe,

501
00:30:11.358 --> 00:30:14.549
I don't know 25 or 30 different kinds of proximate

502
00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:17.250
level explanation. Maybe more that you could offer to

503
00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:18.380
, to, to that in answer to that question

504
00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:22.680
. If you want to give an ultimate level explanation

505
00:30:22.689 --> 00:30:26.368
of why people help. Well, broadly speaking,

506
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.209
we would say that um the tendency to help other

507
00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:33.410
individuals, if it has any genetic basis would be

508
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:40.229
under positive selection if it increases the individual's inclusive fitness

509
00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:41.799
. So if it, if it generates some benefits

510
00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:45.348
in terms of survival or reproductive success, and there

511
00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:48.689
are a few evolutionary routes by which that could be

512
00:30:48.699 --> 00:30:53.088
achieved, for example, um if you help other

513
00:30:53.098 --> 00:30:57.000
individuals, you might improve your reputation and then you

514
00:30:57.009 --> 00:31:00.209
might then improve your standing or your social position,

515
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:03.239
you might be more likely to get helped, um

516
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.650
, by other people when you need it. Given

517
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.199
that you have a reputation for being a helpful person

518
00:31:07.209 --> 00:31:11.729
who is normally doing the right thing for others,

519
00:31:11.098 --> 00:31:15.160
you might um, avoid being punished by other people

520
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.868
if you, if you help in certain scenarios or

521
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.848
if you don't defect in certain scenarios. Um,

522
00:31:19.858 --> 00:31:22.108
there again, just like with the proximate level of

523
00:31:22.118 --> 00:31:26.900
answers, there are, there are multiple different routes

524
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.759
by which a tendency to help others could, could

525
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:33.568
be reconciled with benefits at the individual level. And

526
00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:37.479
you could see how it could be under positive selection

527
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:41.910
. Mhm. So if one of people's concerns is

528
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.328
their reputation, what about when they perform good deeds

529
00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:48.900
that are hidden from others? I mean, what

530
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.588
do, why do we do that? And what

531
00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:53.160
do we have to gain from it? So,

532
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.239
one of the really important things to bear in mind

533
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.170
when we're thinking about things like why does a human

534
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.380
, why do people help other people? Like I

535
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.250
said, one, we can think about these two

536
00:32:04.259 --> 00:32:07.920
different kinds of explanation which we call proximate and ultimate

537
00:32:07.209 --> 00:32:10.959
. And often people don't often have to be aware

538
00:32:10.969 --> 00:32:15.449
of the ultimate level um of the ultimate function of

539
00:32:15.459 --> 00:32:19.818
the behavior for the behavior to be under positive selection

540
00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:22.608
. And so, um if we take a completely

541
00:32:22.618 --> 00:32:24.670
different example, just because sometimes it's easier to think

542
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.009
about something that's slightly different. If you were to

543
00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:31.328
say why do people have sex? Well, on

544
00:32:31.338 --> 00:32:35.309
a proximate level, people have sex because they find

545
00:32:35.318 --> 00:32:37.549
it, um, you know, they enjoy it

546
00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:38.229
or they desire to have it or they find,

547
00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:42.509
you know, they find it subjectively rewarding. The

548
00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:45.989
ultimate reason sex exists and the ultimate function of sex

549
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.719
is, or at least one ultimate function is to

550
00:32:47.729 --> 00:32:51.549
produce offspring. It's a pretty direct means to increase

551
00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:54.259
reproductive success. That doesn't mean that every time we

552
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:57.910
have sex we're kind of thinking about, I'm gonna

553
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.608
get reproductive success. Now, like people, the

554
00:33:00.618 --> 00:33:02.989
proximate and the ultimate reasons why behavior exists can be

555
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.189
completely separate. And often in our mind, we're

556
00:33:07.199 --> 00:33:09.219
not even aware of the ultimate reason why we do

557
00:33:09.229 --> 00:33:12.910
something. And so if you say something like why

558
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.160
do people give anonymously well for many people helping others

559
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.549
or donating to charity or giving in an anonymous way

560
00:33:20.608 --> 00:33:23.949
feels very subjectively rewarding. It's a phenomenon that economists

561
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:27.410
have called the warm glow of giving. And it

562
00:33:27.449 --> 00:33:29.098
, you know, makes you feel all fuzzy and

563
00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:31.150
nice inside to know that you've helped somebody. Um

564
00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:37.660
And that fuzzy warm feeling is evolution's way of getting

565
00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.500
you to do something that on average is in your

566
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:45.259
long term interest that on average might be expected to

567
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:50.140
result in reputation benefits or any other host of benefits

568
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.420
that might occur because of you performing a helpful action

569
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.828
. And if, if occasionally that doesn't happen,

570
00:33:57.838 --> 00:34:00.420
that doesn't mean that the whole strategy is, is

571
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.979
under negative selection. It's a evolution works on averages

572
00:34:02.989 --> 00:34:07.090
, it works on average outcomes. Um And sometimes

573
00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:12.378
the reason why we do something is really quite different

574
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.239
to the evolutionary reason that that behavior exists if that

575
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:19.489
makes sense. Yes, it makes perfect sense.

576
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.119
But in the book, you also talk about how

577
00:34:22.128 --> 00:34:25.409
people tend to be uncharitable toward those who do good

578
00:34:25.418 --> 00:34:28.550
deeds. So, I mean, why is that

579
00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:30.800
then? Yeah. So that's another thing that I

580
00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:31.820
always wanted to come to. So thanks for asking

581
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:35.938
that question. So one of the unusual things about

582
00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:39.809
human psychology is that we don't just, we're not

583
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:45.250
stuck with observing behavior and having to assume that the

584
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.929
behaviors that we observe, that the intentions and the

585
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:52.929
outcomes are always perfectly aligned. So humans have this

586
00:34:52.938 --> 00:34:58.639
very sort of sophisticated form of cognition that some psychological

587
00:34:58.648 --> 00:35:01.989
theory of mind that allows us to look under the

588
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.059
hood. When we see somebody doing something, for

589
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.280
example, giving to charity, we can look under

590
00:35:08.289 --> 00:35:12.699
the hood and we can, we can actually entertain

591
00:35:12.708 --> 00:35:16.119
the possibility that the reason that someone's doing something might

592
00:35:16.128 --> 00:35:22.099
be different to the reason that they, that they

593
00:35:22.128 --> 00:35:23.938
are trying to signal. So for example, when

594
00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:28.398
someone gives to charity, we we know that often

595
00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:31.699
doing charitable acts can result in reputation benefits. And

596
00:35:31.708 --> 00:35:35.340
so when we see someone doing a charitable thing,

597
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:37.639
we can also ask ourselves, well, is the

598
00:35:37.648 --> 00:35:40.978
reason the person is giving to charity? Is it

599
00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:45.599
because they want to help that beneficiary or is it

600
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.989
because they actually want to improve their own image or

601
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.090
their own appearance or how they look to other people

602
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.708
? And this kind of skepticism is a uniquely human

603
00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:58.659
trait. I think it's one that we don't share

604
00:35:58.668 --> 00:36:05.269
with any other nonhuman species and it actually can result

605
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.050
in some quite strange outcomes which is that often doing

606
00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:12.898
good doesn't lead to looking good because people can be

607
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:15.159
suspicious of the reason why you're doing it. And

608
00:36:15.168 --> 00:36:17.260
if we suspect that people are acting with these calculated

609
00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:21.438
or self serving motives in mind, then we frequently

610
00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:24.139
withhold reputation benefits. And we don't, um,

611
00:36:24.289 --> 00:36:28.378
we don't afford that individual, the higher status that

612
00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:31.360
you might normally expect to result from doing these charitable

613
00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:34.668
things. And so in some ways, you can

614
00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.079
then get into these counter cycles of individuals actually hiding

615
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:43.949
their altruistic behavior, for example, by donating anonymously

616
00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:45.570
or, um, something like that so that they

617
00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:50.679
don't invite this skepticism or this suspicion from other people

618
00:36:50.898 --> 00:36:53.570
. There's actually a really lovely quote, um from

619
00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:55.708
Oscar Wilde, which I think really sums it up

620
00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:59.789
nicely, which is, it's something like the nicest

621
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.438
feeling in the world is to donate anonymously, but

622
00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:05.949
have somebody else find out about it. And the

623
00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:07.449
reason that it's the nicest feeling in the world,

624
00:37:07.503 --> 00:37:08.954
it's because of course, if they think you're doing

625
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:13.353
it anonymously, then all the skepticism that results from

626
00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:17.293
looking under the hood is vastly reduced because, uh

627
00:37:17.304 --> 00:37:20.054
, the, you know, there's no, it

628
00:37:20.063 --> 00:37:22.224
seems far less calculated when you do it sort of

629
00:37:22.235 --> 00:37:28.110
anonymously. So, but taking into account all of

630
00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:31.648
the benefits we might get from helping other people talking

631
00:37:31.659 --> 00:37:37.619
from approximate level, perhaps just feeling good and ultimately

632
00:37:37.628 --> 00:37:42.168
, perhaps even increasing our fitness. Can we say

633
00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:46.269
that people are really altruistic or is helping behavior?

634
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:52.909
Ultimately selfish? I think on a proximate psychological level

635
00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:55.070
, lots of what you would call helping behavior or

636
00:37:55.079 --> 00:38:00.378
altruistic behavior is psychologically altruistic. It's, it's motivated

637
00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:05.199
from a genuine desire to help other people or a

638
00:38:05.208 --> 00:38:07.349
genuine enjoyment from, you know, doing the right

639
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.250
thing. And so I, and I think this

640
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.360
is where often I run into, um or I

641
00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:15.840
get challenged by people because they think that you're trying

642
00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:19.820
to take the altruism out of altruism in a way

643
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:23.599
by suggesting that um helping behavior can ultimately be explained

644
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.820
in terms of benefits to the helpful individual. People

645
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:32.820
will often mistakenly assume that that means that all helpful

646
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:37.458
behavior is performed in a calculated manner and with those

647
00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:39.219
benefits in mind. And that's not at all what

648
00:38:39.228 --> 00:38:44.978
an evolutionary perspective would say. So the evolutionary perspective

649
00:38:45.228 --> 00:38:46.695
to, to allow us for the fact that helping

650
00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:51.793
behavior can be psychologically pure can be very, very

651
00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:58.875
genuinely altruistic with no real calculated um uh desire to

652
00:38:58.885 --> 00:39:01.764
improve one's own position, supporting it. But that

653
00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:07.914
doesn't change the fact that those, those psychological motives

654
00:39:07.925 --> 00:39:13.659
, those proximate motives have probably been selected for because

655
00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:17.918
ultimately in an evolutionary sense, performing helpful behaviors or

656
00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:23.780
being co-operative is often the best way to ensure evolutionary

657
00:39:23.789 --> 00:39:29.610
success. And so, yes, I think altruism

658
00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:32.280
a lot of the time is uh can be understood

659
00:39:32.289 --> 00:39:35.719
in terms of self interest. If what you mean

660
00:39:35.728 --> 00:39:38.119
is the self interest, the gene's own selfish interest

661
00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.539
. But I don't think that that means that all

662
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:47.648
altruism is knowingly or calculatedly selfish. So, could

663
00:39:47.659 --> 00:39:52.809
you tell us about interdependence? Yeah. So I

664
00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.579
think, I mean, I mentioned at the start

665
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.909
that I think this is sort of a a neglected

666
00:39:58.148 --> 00:40:01.869
mechanism for supporting cooper operation relative to something like reciprocal

667
00:40:01.878 --> 00:40:07.599
altruism. Um Interdependence is just the idea that you

668
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.668
have a stake in your partner's well being or fitness

669
00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:15.489
more strictly speaking. Um I illustrate the idea of

670
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.289
interdependence in the book using a toy example, which

671
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.119
is imagine if you were in a rowing boat with

672
00:40:23.128 --> 00:40:28.269
um one other person and the boat springs a leak

673
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.708
and the boat's filling up with water and you both

674
00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:34.099
need to bail out the water to, you know

675
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.648
, in order for the boat not to sink.

676
00:40:36.398 --> 00:40:38.289
Now, if you, if you were the kind

677
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.539
of uh prepared individual on the boat and you brought

678
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.769
one chocolate bar, but your friend didn't have a

679
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.699
chocolate bar with them, it could actually be in

680
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:51.469
your own interest to share that chocolate with your friend

681
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.458
to the extent that that allows them to keep on

682
00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:58.000
bailing out the boat. If we assume that both

683
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.610
of you are needed to bail out the boat in

684
00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:00.860
order to stop it sinking, then you suddenly become

685
00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:04.559
really interdependent and it can be in your own best

686
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.840
interest to help your interdependent partner. Even if there's

687
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:10.708
no expectation of reciprocity at that time, simply because

688
00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:14.869
your partner, your own survival or your own well

689
00:41:14.878 --> 00:41:17.539
being is highly dependent on your partner's presence and your

690
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.228
partner's um being there. And so this is the

691
00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:25.764
idea of interdependence and for many issues that live in

692
00:41:25.773 --> 00:41:31.353
groups or that have stable social interactions or repeated social

693
00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:35.735
interactions with the same individuals, it probably makes quite

694
00:41:35.744 --> 00:41:37.614
a lot of sense to think about these interaction partners

695
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:44.793
as being interdependent rather than simply being to individuals that

696
00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:51.094
w that support cooper operation through um a highly dogmatic

697
00:41:51.103 --> 00:41:53.849
form of reciprocal altruism like tit for tat and the

698
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.878
difference between those two things is that in tit for

699
00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:00.639
tat, it only benefits me to help you if

700
00:42:00.648 --> 00:42:02.699
I think you're gonna help me in return. And

701
00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:05.398
if I help you and you don't help me,

702
00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:08.199
then I've just wasted my investment. If we're interdependent

703
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:10.309
, it can benefit me to help you even if

704
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.489
you don't help me in return. And I think

705
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:20.079
that that idea of it um unconditional helping within these

706
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.208
sort of established relationships is much more in line with

707
00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:25.208
what we see in nature. And these relationships probably

708
00:42:25.219 --> 00:42:30.208
are often much more interdependent than we have previously um

709
00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:36.840
assumed. And and why do we care so much

710
00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:40.478
about what other people think of us? Well,

711
00:42:40.489 --> 00:42:45.438
for humans, I think that we are all very

712
00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:49.559
, very sensitive to our image or our reputation.

713
00:42:49.929 --> 00:42:52.668
And some of the reasons for that are that individuals

714
00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:57.579
that gain a good reputation are often more likely to

715
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.969
be chosen as interaction partners. So if you in

716
00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:05.030
experimental settings and also in real world settings, the

717
00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:07.978
most generous individuals are often the people that um in

718
00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:10.500
an experiment, people say they want to choose them

719
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:15.708
as a partner in real world scenarios, those often

720
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.750
occupy more central social network positions, they have more

721
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.510
social capital. Um And they're also more likely to

722
00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:27.469
receive support themselves if they fall ill or if they

723
00:43:27.478 --> 00:43:30.188
are unable to meet their needs. For whatever reason

724
00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:32.250
, the individuals that have accrued, a good reputation

725
00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:36.168
are more likely to receive help from others when they

726
00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:37.860
need it. And I think there are uh this

727
00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:43.978
um this sensitivity to reputation can be explained in terms

728
00:43:43.989 --> 00:43:47.199
of our dependence on one another and our dependence on

729
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:52.119
our social connections to, to survive and to,

730
00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:54.619
to meet our daily requirements. And for sure,

731
00:43:54.628 --> 00:44:00.599
like the humans are massively concerned with our reputation and

732
00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:05.458
we don't really see much evidence of that in any

733
00:44:05.469 --> 00:44:08.860
other species apart from the cleaner fish um system that

734
00:44:08.869 --> 00:44:12.918
I've worked on with red one Bahari. So I

735
00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:15.559
tell you, a bit more about it. Yeah

736
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:15.760
. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I have

737
00:44:15.769 --> 00:44:17.550
them on the show and we talked a little bit

738
00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:20.409
about that. But yeah, please go ahead.

739
00:44:20.708 --> 00:44:22.949
So it's kind of again, it's this idea of

740
00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:28.010
the behavioral destination and the journey because cleaner fish do

741
00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:30.570
show concern for reputation, but they do the cognitive

742
00:44:30.579 --> 00:44:34.769
journey they take to exhibit this concern for reputation is

743
00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.489
very different to the cognitive journey that humans use to

744
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.099
show concern for reputation. So briefly, um,

745
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.119
cleaner fish live on coral reefs and they offer a

746
00:44:44.128 --> 00:44:47.219
cleaning service to their clients, which involves removing parasites

747
00:44:47.228 --> 00:44:50.840
from the surface of the skin. But there's a

748
00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:54.579
conflict between the cleaners and the clients because the cleaners

749
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:58.918
would actually prefer to eat living tissues, mucus and

750
00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:01.648
scales um and not to eat the active parasites.

751
00:45:02.148 --> 00:45:06.099
Now, some of the clients that a cleaner fish

752
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.469
interacts with have a large home range and that means

753
00:45:09.478 --> 00:45:13.469
that they have access to multiple cleaning stations within their

754
00:45:13.478 --> 00:45:15.159
home range and that means that they can afford to

755
00:45:15.168 --> 00:45:17.648
be fussy. So if they, if they go

756
00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:21.168
to a cleaning station and they arrive there and they

757
00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:23.409
see something ending badly, they see the cleaner fish

758
00:45:23.458 --> 00:45:27.010
being chased by the current clients or they see the

759
00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:30.239
current clients swimming away very quickly, then the fussy

760
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.949
client will, can think, ok, I won't

761
00:45:31.958 --> 00:45:34.949
stay here. I'll go some, I'll go to

762
00:45:34.958 --> 00:45:36.878
this other place that I know about this other cleaning

763
00:45:36.889 --> 00:45:39.969
station. Strangely enough, Cleaner Fish seem to be

764
00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:43.530
aware when they're being watched by these, what we

765
00:45:43.539 --> 00:45:47.070
call fussy or visitor clients. And they are actually

766
00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:52.739
more cooper or they offer a better service to their

767
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:57.000
current clients when they're being watched by the fussy or

768
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.878
the visitor client. And this demonstrates a rudimentary concern

769
00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:05.079
for reputation in clean official caring about what other individuals

770
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.949
think. And of course, in the cleaner fish

771
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:10.050
, the cognition that supports this is not the ability

772
00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:13.728
to take perspective, to understand what the client is

773
00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:16.070
thinking or to impute beliefs to the client or anything

774
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:19.898
like this. It can simply be learned through trial

775
00:46:19.909 --> 00:46:22.648
and error that if I do, if I cheat

776
00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:24.050
, then those kinds of clients always swim away.

777
00:46:24.059 --> 00:46:28.103
So therefore, I won't, I'll X parasites and

778
00:46:28.244 --> 00:46:30.465
um they learn through trial and error or through associative

779
00:46:30.474 --> 00:46:36.224
learning what behaviors bring about the rewards that they're seeking

780
00:46:36.563 --> 00:46:37.664
. And so it just again, it's this idea

781
00:46:37.675 --> 00:46:43.454
of thinking about the same behaviors but different cognition supporting

782
00:46:43.465 --> 00:46:47.219
those those same sort of behavioral outcomes. So at

783
00:46:47.228 --> 00:46:50.949
the same time, we also have lots of social

784
00:46:50.958 --> 00:46:52.739
comparison. I mean, we compare ourselves to others

785
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.909
a lot. And I would imagine that particularly in

786
00:46:55.918 --> 00:47:01.250
circumstances where there's lots of inequality that would have negative

787
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.780
psychological impacts on people. So I, I mean

788
00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:08.860
, in what way is the social comparison affect our

789
00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:14.438
lives? Yeah. Again, it's a super interesting

790
00:47:14.449 --> 00:47:17.320
question and I think it's one where there's not actually

791
00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:19.978
, there's, there's, I wouldn't say there's a

792
00:47:19.989 --> 00:47:23.039
consensus yet in the field as to whether social comparison

793
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:28.500
is uniquely human or not. So one way that

794
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.898
social comparison can manifest is as a concern for fairness

795
00:47:30.909 --> 00:47:36.458
or disliking getting rewards that are less than what another

796
00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:38.300
individual gets. Um And in the lab, you

797
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:42.849
can measure this by asking whether individuals will refuse a

798
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.809
reward if a partner gets something better. And this

799
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.648
can be a test of what we call inequity aversion

800
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.840
. Now, we know that young Children are usually

801
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:57.139
very averse to inequity and anyone who's spent any time

802
00:47:57.148 --> 00:47:59.059
with a young child will have heard them shout.

803
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:00.219
Oh, that's not fair. And this kind of

804
00:48:00.228 --> 00:48:05.000
tendency to appreciate what's fair and what's not fair comes

805
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.099
online at about four or five years old and Children

806
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.639
really start to be able to be sensitive to,

807
00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:14.110
I'm getting one thing and you're getting four things and

808
00:48:14.119 --> 00:48:16.750
that's not fair and they will actually refuse. They

809
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:22.099
will sacrifice their one sticker or their one sweet to

810
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.878
prevent the partner from getting more than them. When

811
00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:29.320
people have done similar studies with nonhuman primates and with

812
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:32.320
other animals, the results are much more mixed.

813
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:36.789
And in my view, I don't think that the

814
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.789
evidence is very strong to suggest that other species have

815
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.978
a concern for fairness. And I think that many

816
00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:49.099
of the results in this field are more consistent with

817
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:54.219
much simpler explanations of um of of the cognition that

818
00:48:54.228 --> 00:49:00.010
supports rejecting unfair outcomes. For example, it can

819
00:49:00.019 --> 00:49:02.128
be due to frustration at seeing something you want,

820
00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:06.909
that you can't get or having your expectations violated.

821
00:49:06.918 --> 00:49:08.590
Like you see that one individual gets four, but

822
00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:10.860
you get one. And so you have it,

823
00:49:10.898 --> 00:49:15.438
it's not necessarily a social comparison that we're seeing in

824
00:49:15.739 --> 00:49:17.119
, in other species in the same way that we

825
00:49:17.128 --> 00:49:20.949
, that we see in humans. Um And I

826
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:24.110
think this concern for fairness and this meritocratic psychology,

827
00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:27.958
if you like this idea that things ought to be

828
00:49:27.969 --> 00:49:30.510
fair. And that uh for example, if we

829
00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:34.610
work together to achieve a joint outcome, then we

830
00:49:34.619 --> 00:49:37.728
ought to share the spoils of that outcome where I

831
00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:39.438
shouldn't just take everything for myself and leave you with

832
00:49:39.449 --> 00:49:42.943
nothing, right? This, this is the kind

833
00:49:42.952 --> 00:49:45.152
of um psychology and the kind of behavior that a

834
00:49:45.163 --> 00:49:49.103
concern for fairness can support. And it's really a

835
00:49:49.112 --> 00:49:52.592
point where we really see quite strong divergence between humans

836
00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:59.061
and uh in particular chimpanzees where for example, even

837
00:49:59.072 --> 00:50:02.476
human Children who work together to get a reward will

838
00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:06.936
then voluntarily split that reward with the partner that they

839
00:50:06.945 --> 00:50:10.034
worked to get the reward with. Whereas in chimpanzees

840
00:50:10.045 --> 00:50:12.835
, if they, they will work together to get

841
00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:14.695
a reward, if they have to, but you

842
00:50:14.706 --> 00:50:17.554
never see the in the one individual then giving half

843
00:50:17.565 --> 00:50:20.416
to the other one that helped it. If they

844
00:50:20.425 --> 00:50:22.175
can monopolize the reward, they will monopolize it for

845
00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:25.989
themselves. And so you can see how this non

846
00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:30.800
meritocratic um principle could be a real impediment to collaboration

847
00:50:30.809 --> 00:50:34.099
because in a way, what's the point of working

848
00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:35.579
with you on a task? If we at the

849
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.199
end of it, you, I, you just

850
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:38.320
keep everything for yourself and I don't get anything.

851
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:42.159
And so I think this kind of psychology, this

852
00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:45.769
c this concern for fairness which you call social comparison

853
00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.320
is all part of the same thing. But it's

854
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:52.809
a really crucial foundation of our collaborative natures actually,

855
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:57.389
and our, our ability to work together to achieve

856
00:50:57.398 --> 00:51:00.329
joint success and to motivate individuals to work together,

857
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.389
to achieve joint success. And I think that is

858
00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:09.389
a real point of divergence between humans and the other

859
00:51:09.398 --> 00:51:15.708
great apes. So talking about unfairness, this ability

860
00:51:15.719 --> 00:51:19.530
, we have to join together and rebel against tyrannical

861
00:51:19.539 --> 00:51:22.989
leaders, for example, is it uniquely human?

862
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.809
Do we also find it in other great apes,

863
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:29.239
for example? And if not, uh in what

864
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.389
ways does it allow for us to affect social structures

865
00:51:32.398 --> 00:51:36.699
that we don't really find in other great apes?

866
00:51:37.579 --> 00:51:39.599
I think among the apes, it's quite unique.

867
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:44.329
It's what Christopher Berm has called the reverse dominance hierarchy

868
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.458
where um individuals resist the actions of dominant or big

869
00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:54.039
shot um individuals and instead they work together to prevent

870
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:59.489
any selfish minority from gaining an unfair advantage. Um

871
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.610
And this is part of what why human societies are

872
00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:06.079
often described as being egalitarian. Unlike many of the

873
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.039
other great ape societies that are often much more hierarchical

874
00:52:09.219 --> 00:52:14.329
, much more despotic and where an alpha male often

875
00:52:14.639 --> 00:52:16.969
gets a great, much greater share of reproduction than

876
00:52:16.978 --> 00:52:21.478
the other males in the group. How having said

877
00:52:21.489 --> 00:52:23.809
that I don't think it's unique to humans because there

878
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.820
are, I mean, when we, as I

879
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:29.128
said, at the start, the reason why I

880
00:52:29.139 --> 00:52:32.000
started the book by thinking about co-operation inside our bodies

881
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:36.739
is that I said that some of the common principles

882
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.378
that we saw in the evolution of co-operation to form

883
00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:43.519
individuals, we would also see at different levels or

884
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.938
different scales of um evolution. And one of those

885
00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:52.289
general principles is this idea of the collective pulling against

886
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.668
the might of any selfish entity that tries to gain

887
00:52:55.679 --> 00:52:59.449
an unfair advantage. And one place where we see

888
00:52:59.458 --> 00:53:04.378
that principle in action is actually inside our bodies where

889
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.340
all the genes form what has been called a parliament

890
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:10.929
of the genes where they, they all work to

891
00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:15.079
together in some ways to prevent the actions of any

892
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:20.239
selfish genetic element or any selfish gene that tries to

893
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:23.478
over replicate itself relative to the others. They were

894
00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:27.360
the the rest of the genome works together to prevent

895
00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:30.619
any of those selfish entities from having their way and

896
00:53:30.628 --> 00:53:36.780
from disrupting the um the the stability of the collective

897
00:53:37.699 --> 00:53:42.179
in some social insect species. You see workers who

898
00:53:42.188 --> 00:53:46.699
work together to collectively police the actions of any single

899
00:53:46.708 --> 00:53:50.300
worker who tries to lay eggs in the society.

900
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:53.409
So sometimes worker ants or worker bees can lay under

901
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:57.619
fertilized eggs that will develop into males. But the

902
00:53:57.628 --> 00:54:00.289
other workers in the society will often eat those eggs

903
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.889
, they'll cannibalize them. And that's called worker policing

904
00:54:01.898 --> 00:54:05.070
. And again, you see the might of the

905
00:54:05.079 --> 00:54:09.429
collective at work in holding the kind of the interests

906
00:54:09.438 --> 00:54:15.389
of selfish entities, selfish genes, selfish individuals in

907
00:54:15.398 --> 00:54:17.599
check. And so I actually think that that pattern

908
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:21.418
of the collective a bit like a tug of war

909
00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:22.889
. The collective on one end of the rope pulling

910
00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:25.849
against the in the individual selfish elements. On the

911
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.869
other end is a real common theme that we see

912
00:54:29.878 --> 00:54:35.360
at all levels of life and the transitions to greater

913
00:54:35.369 --> 00:54:39.769
complexity, the evolutionary transitions to greater complexity occur when

914
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:45.280
that collective is able to overwhelm the interests of the

915
00:54:45.289 --> 00:54:47.949
selfish, uh the the the sort of selfish entities

916
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.409
. So we're reaching our time limit. So,

917
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:55.530
uh so let me just ask you one last question

918
00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:58.688
with all of this in mind. I mean,

919
00:54:58.699 --> 00:55:00.280
with what we know about the evolution of human cooper

920
00:55:00.289 --> 00:55:05.280
operation and how it works? Is it possible for

921
00:55:05.289 --> 00:55:08.929
us to foster uh large scale cooper operation? Like

922
00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:13.449
for example, nowadays, we have issues to tackle

923
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:15.760
like climate change, which demand, I mean,

924
00:55:15.769 --> 00:55:21.889
international Co Ordination. Is there something that you wrote

925
00:55:21.898 --> 00:55:24.958
about in your book or uh somewhere else about human

926
00:55:24.969 --> 00:55:29.708
cooper operation that we can use with that with that

927
00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:34.989
goal in mind. So I think that many of

928
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.269
the massive global problems that we face today are problems

929
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.510
of failed co-operation and they are problems that require us

930
00:55:43.519 --> 00:55:49.289
to co-operate at global scales. And it's not obvious

931
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.000
that this is something that we're especially good at.

932
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.344
So we're what one problem with global cooper operation in

933
00:55:55.355 --> 00:55:59.545
a way is that it's constantly at risk of being

934
00:55:59.554 --> 00:56:05.304
undermined by co-operation at lower levels and co-operation that's easier

935
00:56:05.355 --> 00:56:08.755
to achieve. So, for example, um nepotism

936
00:56:08.766 --> 00:56:14.666
and corruption and bribery are all forms of local co-operation

937
00:56:14.835 --> 00:56:16.385
that are quite natural to us in some ways,

938
00:56:16.394 --> 00:56:21.291
nepotism is helping us family corruption or things like that

939
00:56:21.302 --> 00:56:22.221
or can be helping your friends. I mean,

940
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.302
these are forms of cooper operation and they are,

941
00:56:24.471 --> 00:56:28.601
they come much more easily to us in some respects

942
00:56:28.632 --> 00:56:31.471
than cooperating at a global scale with people that we

943
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:35.701
don't know that we might never meet. Um And

944
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.710
so I don't think it's a given that we will

945
00:56:38.721 --> 00:56:45.500
necessarily be able to resolve the global challenges that we

946
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:46.929
face. And I certainly am not gonna sit here

947
00:56:46.938 --> 00:56:50.139
and tell you that I have the answers. But

948
00:56:50.418 --> 00:56:52.820
II, I also don't think, I don't think

949
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:53.659
it's totally out of our grasp to do it.

950
00:56:53.668 --> 00:56:58.458
But I think it, it in it will involve

951
00:56:58.469 --> 00:57:01.280
us learning how to co-operate at a scale that we've

952
00:57:01.289 --> 00:57:07.478
never really before managed to do effectively. And so

953
00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.449
I guess it's for me, I think it's still

954
00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:15.829
really an open question how the human story really ends

955
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.019
and what, whether we managed to over climate disaster

956
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.769
and, and you know, o overcome future pandemics

957
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.869
that we're going to experience and things like this,

958
00:57:25.878 --> 00:57:29.090
I think we can do it. Um But whether

959
00:57:29.099 --> 00:57:30.860
we will do it, I think is up to

960
00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:35.938
us. OK. So, uh the book is

961
00:57:35.949 --> 00:57:38.119
again, the Social Instinct of cooper operation shaped the

962
00:57:38.128 --> 00:57:42.110
world. Uh Where can people find you on the

963
00:57:42.119 --> 00:57:46.000
internet? Um I am probably most easy to find

964
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:50.840
on Twitter where I my handle is at Nicola Rajani

965
00:57:50.869 --> 00:57:52.559
. My full name, I have a website called

966
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.000

967
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.929

968
00:57:59.938 --> 00:58:01.599
me there. OK. So it's been a real

969
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.449
