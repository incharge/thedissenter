00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.649
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.419
the Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lops

3
00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.889
. And today I'm joined by Doctor Paul Halpern.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.948
He is Professor of Physics at Saint Joseph's University in

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.810
Philadelphia. He is the author of several books.

6
00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.888
And today we're focusing on his latest one, the

7
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.940
Allure of the Multiverse, extra dimensions, other worlds

8
00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.208
and parallel universes. So Paul, welcome to the

9
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.699
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone. My

10
00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.429
pleasure to thank you for having me on your show

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.649
, Ricardo. So let's start with this then.

12
00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.408
Uh I know that in the book, you go

13
00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:38.368
through a little bit actually of the history behind the

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.889
idea of the multiverse and the UX you of of

15
00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.590
course, focus mostly on physics, but you also

16
00:00:45.598 --> 00:00:49.250
talk about the ideas of some philosophers, for example

17
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.130
. So do you know how old is the idea

18
00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:58.548
of the multiverse actually? Well, it's interesting because

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.340
the term multiverse goes back to William James who was

20
00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:07.250
a, a writer and uh and also kind of

21
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.329
an early psychologist. And uh he talked about the

22
00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:15.558
psychological idea of a multiverse back in the 19th century

23
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.329
uh as kind of a morally ambiguous universe, that

24
00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:23.019
a universe that was neither good nor evil and was

25
00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:26.769
pretty much ambivalent to whether someone is good, someone

26
00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:29.808
is evil. So he called it kind of a

27
00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.588
moral multiverse. But that's just a term. I

28
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.159
don't think he meant that in the sense of parallel

29
00:01:36.168 --> 00:01:42.778
universes and the idea of parallel universes and science really

30
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.150
took off in the 19 seventies and 19 eighties and

31
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.698
especially in this century, in the 21st century,

32
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.599
the idea really became popular but going all the way

33
00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.719
back to the people like Giordano, Bruno, uh

34
00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:04.109
you know, the Italian uh philosopher, that's when

35
00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.909
people start talking about many worlds out there, worlds

36
00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:09.788
that might be similar to earth. And Bruno,

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.949
of course, famously was burned at the stake for

38
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.028
writing that there are an infinite number of worlds out

39
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.625
there. And some of those could be, you

40
00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:23.104
know, inhabited and like earth. And he speculated

41
00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:27.925
about this and that was considered uh heresy blasphemy by

42
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.985
the Roman inquisition. And, you know, sadly

43
00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:32.903
, he was killed by the Roman inquisition for,

44
00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:37.110
for that heresy and other heresies. And then around

45
00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.288
the same time, Galileo, who was a little

46
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.990
bit higher placed, he had more connections. So

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.368
he wasn't uh luckily he wasn't executed, but he

48
00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.770
also speculated about, you know, many worlds out

49
00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:52.819
there. And then in the 19th century, based

50
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.649
upon Newtonian physics, Newtonian determinism, uh people start

51
00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.778
figuring out that if you have a finite number of

52
00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:04.288
elements a finite number of possibilities. But an infinite

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.319
universe eventually all the combinations would start to repeat themselves

54
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.229
. So just like if you're playing uh the game

55
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.080
of chess, eventually you run out of moves and

56
00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:16.710
would repeat the same moves. They're not an infinite

57
00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.520
number of moves in chess. Similarly, uh if

58
00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:23.409
you had an infinite universe, but a finite number

59
00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.129
of elements and a finite number of possibilities, eventually

60
00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.528
, you would have something like Earth recreated and the

61
00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:37.919
philosopher, while the the revolutionary uh Luis Blanc Blanche

62
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.849
in France, while he was imprisoned in a fortress

63
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.139
for revolutionary activity, speculated that there might be um

64
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.490
many, many copies of Earth out there that some

65
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.508
of them might be exact, some of them might

66
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.588
be inexact. And maybe some of the things that

67
00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.250
play out on Earth would happen in some of the

68
00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:02.189
other universes such as, you know, French revolution

69
00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.469
and so forth. So it's kind of interesting to

70
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.800
think about this. But now we know that the

71
00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:13.990
universe is expanding and accelerating its expansion. So and

72
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.709
it might be that there is a duplicate Earth out

73
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.759
there, but it would be so far away from

74
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.108
us will be well beyond the possibility of observation,

75
00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:29.639
well beyond the observable universe, because the sheer probability

76
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.298
of creating uh something that's exactly like the Earth would

77
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:39.139
be so minimal that it would take far longer than

78
00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:42.588
the than the time length of the Big Bang and

79
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.738
far greater than the size of the observable universe to

80
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.209
recreate something like that. So it's, it's pretty

81
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.439
much impossible. So one idea that you mentioned there

82
00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.798
, the fact that people at a certain point notice

83
00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.069
that if there are a limited number of possible arrangements

84
00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:05.559
of matter, then if time is infinite, then

85
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.108
eventually the same configurations would repeat themselves over time.

86
00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:15.139
That's actually something that comes around also in Nietzsche,

87
00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.670
right? And the idea of the eternal return because

88
00:05:18.678 --> 00:05:20.608
I, I guess that in that aspect, he

89
00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:26.629
was influenced by some uh physicists back in the 19th

90
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.699
century, right? Yeah. So Friedrich Nietzsche,

91
00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.230
the German philosopher um came up with the idea of

92
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:40.689
eternal return. And uh he unlike uh Eastern philosophers

93
00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.790
, he talked about an exact repetition of history.

94
00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.048
Um So he imagined that his life and all of

95
00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:53.069
its pain and suffering and some joy, mostly a

96
00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.660
little bit of joy would um repeat itself sometime in

97
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.319
the future just based upon the idea of chance reoccurrence

98
00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.399
. So, you know, for any kind of

99
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.889
game with finite elements, I mentioned chess, but

100
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.928
also the game of tiktok Toe with Xs and Os

101
00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.519
. Eventually you just run out of moves. And

102
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.238
Tik Tok Toe, if you're familiar with it has

103
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.579
a square, has nine uh elements in a square

104
00:06:23.588 --> 00:06:27.040
with Xs and Os is the only possibilities. And

105
00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.108
it's, it could be a boring game if you

106
00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:30.759
play it long enough because you repeat the same moves

107
00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:33.899
again and again. And similarly, Nietzsche thought that

108
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.000
his life will repeat itself. But if we estimate

109
00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:44.079
how long it would take for earth to repeat itself

110
00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:45.959
, uh It was, you know, far,

111
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.730
far, far, you know, almost unimaginably far

112
00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:53.959
longer than the history of the universe. So it's

113
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.160
, it's incredibly unlikely as people like uh Nietzsche's contemporary

114
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.439
Ludwig Boltzmann pointed out Boltzmann talked about the idea of

115
00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.019
the arrow of time and increasing entropy. People said

116
00:07:06.028 --> 00:07:08.738
, hey, wait a minute, things could randomly

117
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.329
come together again. But the estimate of that happening

118
00:07:14.298 --> 00:07:18.160
, it's just incredibly improbable. So uh normally we

119
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.250
don't have to worry about it. Mhm But uh

120
00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.879
let me just ask you one question since you mentioned

121
00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.858
Giordano Bruno there earlier and also Galileo and I,

122
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:32.108
we're talking about Nietzsche because if I understand it correctly

123
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:35.769
, uh For example, Giordano Bruno was uh talking

124
00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:41.350
back then in the 16 century or so about there

125
00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:45.059
being other worlds. But by worlds, I guess

126
00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.139
he was referring mostly to planets, other planets like

127
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:50.798
earth out there, I mean, but so uh

128
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:57.428
and if those people are mostly talking about uh other

129
00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.629
worlds in our universe or in the case of Nietzsche

130
00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:05.850
inside of our universe, things repeating themselves over time

131
00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:11.269
. Uh That isn't exactly the same thing as a

132
00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:15.220
multiverse. Yeah, that is an excellent point.

133
00:08:15.548 --> 00:08:18.608
And that's why I say the modern idea of a

134
00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:22.980
multiverse, actual multiverse started in really in the 19

135
00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:28.298
seventies when you had Bryce de Witt popularizing the idea

136
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:31.038
of Hugh Everett of um what's called the many worlds

137
00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:35.928
interpretation of quantum mechanics. And that's a name that

138
00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:39.629
Dewitt uh almost coined. He said many universes,

139
00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:43.070
but it became many worlds. And then Brandon Carter

140
00:08:43.298 --> 00:08:46.080
took that idea and turned it into the, you

141
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.750
know, variation of it into the anthropic principle.

142
00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:52.500
And then later, other scientists took that idea to

143
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:54.918
try to explain fine tuning and I'm sure we'll talk

144
00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:58.359
about that later. But that was an actual idea

145
00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:01.658
of something beyond the physical universe. But, you

146
00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:07.489
know, our scope has expanded over the centuries.

147
00:09:07.658 --> 00:09:11.719
So of course, um in a time of Pythagoras

148
00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:13.019
, the time of the ancient Greeks, no one

149
00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:18.548
imagined that there was really anything beyond earth. And

150
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.359
maybe the, you know, the Pythagorean talked about

151
00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:24.178
a central fire, but they talked about 10 objects

152
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.509
including the celestial sphere, which was, you know

153
00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:31.359
, this the dome of stars and that was kind

154
00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:35.590
of considered something fixed out there, not something with

155
00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:39.129
, you know, unlimited objects, but something that

156
00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:41.830
was just kind of this fixed dome, fixed uh

157
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.538
element. And um you know, these planets,

158
00:09:46.678 --> 00:09:50.889
but we had no idea what the scope of the

159
00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:52.840
the galaxy was, let alone the universe. And

160
00:09:52.849 --> 00:09:56.570
then of course, in the time of Galileo and

161
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.849
Bruno, we started to think about um other stars

162
00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:03.700
, other planets uh but they weren't known yet and

163
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.308
it was only in the 19 nineties, believe it

164
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.599
or not that um astronomers detected the first exoplanets beyond

165
00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:16.298
the solar system. And that was, you know

166
00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:20.340
, when we got to confirm that hypothesis, finally

167
00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:24.109
, Bruno hypothesis that there are actually other planets around

168
00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:26.750
other stars. And now most astronomers think that there

169
00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:30.469
are trillions of planets out there. You know,

170
00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:33.229
just based upon the ones we've found so far,

171
00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:35.649
the thousands of ones we've found so far, if

172
00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:39.719
you extrapolate, there are likely planets around most stars

173
00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:43.629
. So we can talk about trillions of planets out

174
00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:46.788
there. But then within, you know, within

175
00:10:46.798 --> 00:10:50.210
the last 100 years, believe it or not.

176
00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:54.739
Um That's when we discovered other Galaxies. It was

177
00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:00.320
only really in 1926 with the observations of Edwin Hubble

178
00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:03.678
that we showed that the Andromeda nebula as it was

179
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.869
called, it was thought to be a gas cloud

180
00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:11.168
was really an object outside of, of our own

181
00:11:11.178 --> 00:11:13.109
own galaxy. And that resolved what was called the

182
00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:16.989
great debate over whether or not the milky way was

183
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.250
the only object give or take a few things in

184
00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:24.330
the periphery or if there are numerous Galaxies out there

185
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:31.489
. And how do physicists themselves uh think about the

186
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.250
multiverse? And are there different conceptualizations of what the

187
00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:41.950
multiverse might be among physicists? Yeah. So there

188
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.298
are many different multiverses which can be a little bit

189
00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:48.399
confusing and none of them are really like the cultural

190
00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.330
idea of the multiverse, which you can also talk

191
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.450
about, which is the multiverse in movies. So

192
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.119
everyone imagines in movies, you know, you wake

193
00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:00.099
up and you, you go through a portal and

194
00:12:00.109 --> 00:12:03.798
you see a near identical version of yourself or you

195
00:12:03.808 --> 00:12:07.058
see, you know, a, a superhero that

196
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.798
has a different origin story, like a different Spiderman

197
00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:13.808
or different, you know, different version of ultra

198
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.298
or whatever, like different superheroes. But uh you

199
00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:22.739
know, in, in physics, the multiverse ideas

200
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.629
are confined to either something having to do with the

201
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.239
very small or something having to do with the very

202
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:35.158
large. So either quantum multiverse or a cosmological multiverse

203
00:12:35.798 --> 00:12:39.279
. And the quantum multiverse is usually called the many

204
00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:43.259
worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. And that was developed

205
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:48.279
by Hugh Everett the third who was a student of

206
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.090
the great American physicist John Wheeler, who I who

207
00:12:52.099 --> 00:12:54.700
I had the pleasure of meeting before he passed away

208
00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:58.798
, very interesting fellow. And whoever it proposed the

209
00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:03.918
idea that when you take a quantum measurement, you

210
00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:07.750
the observer do not affect the measurement, uh you

211
00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:09.950
do not influence the measurement. So then the question

212
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.879
arises, how come you get an exact result?

213
00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:16.019
Whereas we know in quantum physics, you have a

214
00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:20.830
blending of possibilities before the measurement is taken. How

215
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.908
do you get an exact result when the measurement was

216
00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:26.820
taken? And the old idea, the orthodox idea

217
00:13:26.908 --> 00:13:30.989
is that the measurer collapses the wave function down to

218
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.178
one possibility like knocking over a a stack of of

219
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.000
cards and collapsing it down to a single pile.

220
00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:43.940
Well Everett's idea is that the measurer does not affect

221
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.298
anything. Rather the measurer sees all the possibilities,

222
00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:52.700
all the the different outcomes at once. Well,

223
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.389
how can that happen? Because the measurers conscious uh

224
00:13:56.399 --> 00:14:01.038
conscious record says, I see one observation. So

225
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:05.609
that must mean that the measures consciousness branches out into

226
00:14:05.619 --> 00:14:11.389
multiple possibilities. And each version of the conscious observer

227
00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:15.509
sees a different value or a different outcome of the

228
00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:20.548
measurement. So there's a branching of human beings that

229
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:26.500
matches the branching of quantum outcomes and that all matches

230
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:31.080
up with a universal wave function that never collapses.

231
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:35.979
But there's all these possibilities out there in different enclaves

232
00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:39.149
of the universe. So that gives you parallel universes

233
00:14:39.158 --> 00:14:43.379
. So that's a quantum idea and cosmology. It's

234
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:48.158
the possibility of other bubble universes out there aside from

235
00:14:48.168 --> 00:14:52.408
the Big Bang. So aside from uh our own

236
00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:54.529
Big Bang, that there are other universes expanding out

237
00:14:54.538 --> 00:14:58.769
there just beyond the range of observation. And that

238
00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:03.418
for some people is more palatable because that's not something

239
00:15:03.428 --> 00:15:05.969
that's happening all the time. This is something that

240
00:15:05.979 --> 00:15:11.250
um happens, you know, with a cosmogenesis event

241
00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:13.739
, a uni universe creation event. And it almost

242
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.428
seems in a way logical if our universe is created

243
00:15:18.979 --> 00:15:22.979
in a in a relatively easy way through um you

244
00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:26.418
know, the observable universe created in a process called

245
00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:31.139
inflation that maybe inflation happens, you know, elsewhere

246
00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:37.469
in in reality. And so those are the main

247
00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:43.629
reasons uh why the theoretical physicists have theorized about the

248
00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:50.269
possible multiverse is I, is it for with,

249
00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:54.830
with the idea of explaining those aspects of our reality

250
00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.658
? Yes. Well, we want to explain the

251
00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:03.070
observable universe and we want to explain the observable results

252
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.129
from quantum measurements. So we know that when we

253
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:10.798
take a quantum measurement, we get um if we

254
00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:12.678
repeat the measurement, we, we might get different

255
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.639
outcomes. But we can, if we repeat the

256
00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:19.389
measurement enough times, we can map out the probabilities

257
00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:22.440
of those various outcomes. So we know that there's

258
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.779
a certain amount of chance, we know that there's

259
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.750
a certain range of possibilities. We know that we

260
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:33.058
don't always get the same possibility. And we know

261
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:41.538
that um that the uh results uh can only be

262
00:16:41.548 --> 00:16:45.000
precise for certain parameters that we, because of Eise

263
00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:49.798
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that we can't measure position pre precisely

264
00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.288
and the momentum precisely at the same time. So

265
00:16:52.298 --> 00:16:55.558
these are things we know the question is how to

266
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.558
explain it. And there are many different ways to

267
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.330
explain quantum measurement. Uh Similarly, we know that

268
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.019
the universe on the largest scale is very even very

269
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:07.410
regular. If we look in one direction, we

270
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.559
see pretty much the same number of Galaxies as in

271
00:17:11.568 --> 00:17:15.699
the complete opposite direction. If we look and measure

272
00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:19.269
the cosmic radiation background, the temperature of it is

273
00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:22.939
very, very close to the same in all directions

274
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:26.499
, there's slight variations. So the question is how

275
00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:27.567
do we get such uniformity. Is it just a

276
00:17:27.577 --> 00:17:33.538
coincidence or is there some reason that the universe smoothed

277
00:17:33.548 --> 00:17:37.218
out in the beginning that led to the idea of

278
00:17:37.229 --> 00:17:41.378
inflation? And then it turns out that inflation is

279
00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:45.837
pretty easy to produce in Einstein's general theory of relativity

280
00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.798
by just having the right energy configuration, the right

281
00:17:48.807 --> 00:17:53.469
energy set up. So um so Andre Linday,

282
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.858
the Russian born um cosmologist who's now at Stanford University

283
00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:02.598
, came up with the idea of an eternal inflation

284
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.640
, which is that this happens repeatedly. But I

285
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.969
should say that the idea of the multiverse really became

286
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:15.660
popular when people started grappling with the idea that the

287
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:21.019
cosmological constant of the universe, which is a anti

288
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:25.410
kind of anti gravity parameter that's causing the universe to

289
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:32.559
slightly accelerate um over time um seems very large by

290
00:18:32.568 --> 00:18:37.439
one calculation, calculating the quantum energy background. So

291
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:41.390
if you look at empty space, it's not really

292
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.699
empty, it has particles that are popping in and

293
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.118
out of emptiness. And if you add up the

294
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.029
energy of all those particles, you get something that

295
00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:56.140
could be called the cosmological constant. And let me

296
00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.338
explain what the cosmological constant is. When Einstein developed

297
00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:06.229
his general theory of relativity, which is how space

298
00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:11.400
and time uh create gravity through their curvature. He

299
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.309
realized that he wasn't getting stable results, he was

300
00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:18.420
getting results that would either contract or expand. And

301
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.328
it was when he developed that was, that was

302
00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:26.068
before hubble's um proof as it turns out that the

303
00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:29.890
universe is expanding and he thought he made a mistake

304
00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:33.160
. So he added the cosmological constant as a stabilizing

305
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.410
term, which kind of pushes the universe outward to

306
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.259
stabilize it against gravity to make it a steady universe

307
00:19:41.269 --> 00:19:45.130
, a static universe. But then uh he dropped

308
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.509
that idea. He said it was a big mistake

309
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.809
that he shouldn't have even introduced it. But ideas

310
00:19:49.818 --> 00:19:53.890
tend to persist. And in 1998 2 teams of

311
00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.549
cosmologists used um uh observations of the universe to show

312
00:20:00.739 --> 00:20:03.519
that not only is the universe expanding, it's accelerating

313
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:07.598
in its expansion. So something is pushing it out

314
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.479
faster and faster over time. And that must be

315
00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:15.059
something which sometimes is called dark energy. But you

316
00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:19.029
could also use a cosmological constant as a way of

317
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:23.640
modeling that dark dark energy that cosmological constant turns out

318
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.279
to be very, very small because if it were

319
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:30.098
big, it would have affected uh the development of

320
00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:33.818
stars Galaxies and so forth. It would have made

321
00:20:33.828 --> 00:20:37.318
it impossible for structure to form. So it's this

322
00:20:37.328 --> 00:20:42.439
really, really minute cosmological constant. So you don't

323
00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:47.640
feel it until billions of years into the history of

324
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.039
the universe. So the 1st 5 billion years of

325
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:53.068
so the history of the universe, you don't feel

326
00:20:53.078 --> 00:20:59.479
this anti gravity push and stars can form Galaxies form

327
00:20:59.489 --> 00:21:02.969
earth forms, everything forms just nice. But then

328
00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:04.500
later in the history of the universe, suddenly you

329
00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:07.630
start feeling this outward push and the universe starts to

330
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.969
speed up in its expansion because this cosmological constant term

331
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:17.989
is small. But people in quantum field theory calculate

332
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
the cosmological constant based on the energy of empty space

333
00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:23.598
. And they say it must be huge. So

334
00:21:23.608 --> 00:21:27.828
the question is why in reality, you have a

335
00:21:27.838 --> 00:21:33.650
small cosmological constant. But really based on quantum field

336
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.059
theory, you should have a large one. And

337
00:21:36.068 --> 00:21:38.650
the answer that some people have is that maybe the

338
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:44.259
universe is really a multiverse and that you have all

339
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:47.420
these expanding universes out there. And each of them

340
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.509
has its own cosmological constant and that some of them

341
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:56.039
are enormous and some of them are moderate. And

342
00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:57.479
we happen to be in an outlier, we happen

343
00:21:57.489 --> 00:22:03.420
to be in the very, very odd strange universe

344
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.559
that has a tiny cosmological constant. So, um

345
00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:10.939
you know, so we are just in this really

346
00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:15.170
bizarre universe that has a small cosmo cosmological constant.

347
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.630
But it's lucky that we are because that's the only

348
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.979
way stars can form and Galaxies can form and life

349
00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:26.150
can form. And that's why we're here because we

350
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.868
happen to be in a universe with a tiny cosmological

351
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.598
constant and all the other universes with the large cosmological

352
00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:36.259
constants never formed structure. So there was no one

353
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:37.608
there to say, hey, we're in a universe

354
00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:42.900
with a large cosmological constant. So you mentioned Einstein

355
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.549
there and of course, if theorize about the space

356
00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:52.799
time continuum and about 1/4 dimension of reality. Does

357
00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:57.608
this idea of going above the three dimensions also connect

358
00:22:57.618 --> 00:23:02.578
in any way to the idea of the multiverse or

359
00:23:02.588 --> 00:23:06.068
not? Well, the idea of dimensions is very

360
00:23:06.078 --> 00:23:08.368
interesting. Uh dimensions is a little bit of a

361
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:15.229
strange concept because we know that there are three tangible

362
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:18.799
physical dimensions. You know, if we, we

363
00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:21.459
can, you know, walk north and south,

364
00:23:21.469 --> 00:23:22.519
we can walk east and west or we can jump

365
00:23:22.529 --> 00:23:26.019
up and down. Those are the three ways we

366
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:30.068
can move. Uh So those are the physical dimensions

367
00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:33.949
. But then at some point, people started saying

368
00:23:34.348 --> 00:23:37.289
, even in the late 19th century, that time

369
00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:42.309
has a quality that resembles a dimension. Uh because

370
00:23:42.318 --> 00:23:48.368
uh you can imagine things changing over time just like

371
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.348
they might be different in different directions in space.

372
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.699
And that was idea was solidified. Uh When Herman

373
00:23:56.118 --> 00:24:02.539
Mankowski in 1907 said that Einstein's special theory of relativity

374
00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:07.068
was best developed in 44 dimensions. And finally,

375
00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:10.199
after a few years of saying, oh dimensions,

376
00:24:10.608 --> 00:24:12.588
four dimension is kind of an abstract concept and not

377
00:24:12.598 --> 00:24:17.318
really liking it. Einstein adopted the fourth dimension and

378
00:24:17.328 --> 00:24:19.549
used it in his general theory of relativity. So

379
00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:25.420
that's pretty well accepted. But around the time that

380
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:30.400
Einstein proposed General Relativity, a phys, a mathematician

381
00:24:30.608 --> 00:24:34.880
uh Theodore Kaluza who was in uh East Prussia and

382
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:40.088
part of then part of Germany, a German empire

383
00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:42.309
um wrote to Einstein and said, hey, wait

384
00:24:42.318 --> 00:24:45.318
a minute, maybe you can add another force to

385
00:24:45.328 --> 00:24:48.868
your theory, electricity and magnetism, which we call

386
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.459
electromagnetism by adding an extra dimension to your theory and

387
00:24:53.469 --> 00:25:00.969
having 1/5 dimension that uh we don't detect but still

388
00:25:00.979 --> 00:25:04.088
comes into the theory. So that's the Kusa idea

389
00:25:04.098 --> 00:25:07.910
of the fifth dimension. And later someone named Oscar

390
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.979
Klein connected with qua quantum physics. So now we

391
00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:17.989
call that Kusa Klein um higher dimensional theory. And

392
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.269
Klein proposed the idea that the higher dimension was kind

393
00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:26.019
of curled up into a very tight circle, kind

394
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:29.328
of like if you look at a piece of spaghetti

395
00:25:29.338 --> 00:25:32.259
or a piece of pasta, and you look at

396
00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:33.979
not the long part of it, but we look

397
00:25:33.989 --> 00:25:37.509
at the radius of it. It's very, very

398
00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.549
tiny. So if you were observing a piece of

399
00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:45.568
spaghetti from a great distance, it would just look

400
00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:47.969
like a one dimensional object, it would look like

401
00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.890
a straight line. You wouldn't be able to tell

402
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.088
that it has a thickness. And similarly in the

403
00:25:55.098 --> 00:25:57.959
uh Calusa Klein picture, um the higher dimension,

404
00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:02.289
the fifth dimension is curled up so tightly into such

405
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:06.289
a tight little circle that we never really detect it

406
00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:10.670
, that's impossible to detect. Well, um if

407
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.890
you look later in the history of physics, string

408
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:18.689
theory was developed starting in the 19 eighties as this

409
00:26:18.699 --> 00:26:22.949
idea that particles are not really particles, but they're

410
00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:27.078
energetic strands that are vibrating and their vibrations create the

411
00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:34.279
particle categories. But mathematicians discovered that string theory does

412
00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:40.979
not mathematically make sense. It's mathematically inconsistent unless you

413
00:26:40.989 --> 00:26:45.299
put it into a 10 dimensional theory at least.

414
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:48.140
And so you need to add not just 1/5 dimension

415
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.578
, but you need to add six more dimensions beyond

416
00:26:52.588 --> 00:26:55.789
space and time. So, uh so you have

417
00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:00.390
10 dimensions. And um in a related topic called

418
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:04.670
Super Gravity, um people like Eugene Kremer and Bernard

419
00:27:04.729 --> 00:27:10.910
Julia in France developed the idea of spontaneous compact application

420
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.680
. Um And I think that was developed in the

421
00:27:12.689 --> 00:27:18.039
late 19 seventies, this idea that um all the

422
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:22.890
other dimensions would collapse and you would only see four

423
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.979
of the dimensions, but the other dimensions would just

424
00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:30.880
, you know, become crushed into something that's undetectable

425
00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:37.818
. And um other physicists found that there are many

426
00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:40.719
, many, many different ways that this collapse of

427
00:27:40.729 --> 00:27:45.180
the higher dimensions can occur and many different possible geometries

428
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:48.098
for the higher dimension. Once it's collapsed, it

429
00:27:48.108 --> 00:27:53.049
turns out to be 10 to the 500 power possibilities

430
00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:56.118
for this kind of collapse into 10 to the 500

431
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:00.410
power types of geometries. And you could think of

432
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.209
those geometries kind of like pretzels, not just rings

433
00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:08.759
but or doughnuts, but all these different twisty pretzels

434
00:28:10.078 --> 00:28:14.539
, you know, and imagine 10 with a 500

435
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:19.358
zeros possibilities. And each of these can lead to

436
00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:26.559
its own universe model its own physics. And um

437
00:28:26.568 --> 00:28:29.838
some physicists talk about, you know, 10 to

438
00:28:29.848 --> 00:28:34.539
the 500 possible universes out there, each with its

439
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:40.959
own um type of what we call internal geometry.

440
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.150
Um internal meaning that you don't really see it as

441
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.670
opposed to external geometry. So that's another yet another

442
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.828
idea of the multiverse is that to try to explain

443
00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:57.608
why we're in one particular type of universe. But

444
00:28:57.618 --> 00:29:00.430
there's all these other possibilities out there, 10 to

445
00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:04.390
the 500 other possibilities out there, which is very

446
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.828
, very perplexing. And that's how dimensions comes into

447
00:29:07.838 --> 00:29:12.890
the picture of the multiverse models. And so these

448
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.410
universes with different configurations. WW should we expect them

449
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.539
to also have different laws of physics? Yes.

450
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:30.650
So they would have uh not necessarily uh super different

451
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.689
laws like you might like, you might think if

452
00:29:33.699 --> 00:29:36.049
you know naively physics, you say, OK,

453
00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:38.430
force equals mass times acceleration, something you learn in

454
00:29:38.439 --> 00:29:41.479
basic physics. And then, you know, you

455
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:45.559
wouldn't have like force is mass to the third power

456
00:29:45.568 --> 00:29:49.299
at times acceleration hub, but you might have uh

457
00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:55.118
different constants strength constants for the forces. So we

458
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.920
have all these parameters in physics which tell you how

459
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.318
strong, how strongly particles can interact with each other

460
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.289
. So for example, uh if you have,

461
00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:12.318
you know, two magnets like two refrigerator magnets or

462
00:30:12.328 --> 00:30:17.140
bar magnets, and you hold them 1 m away

463
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.130
from each other, you know how strong the attraction

464
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.759
will be. Well, maybe in another universe,

465
00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:26.039
they would have a much stronger attraction to each other

466
00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:26.930
. Maybe in a third universe, they have a

467
00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:30.949
much weaker attraction to each other. So, in

468
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:33.848
one universe, like, you might have a refrigerator

469
00:30:34.189 --> 00:30:37.670
and you wanna put a magnet on the refrigerator,

470
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.650
you know, with your favorite football team or something

471
00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.920
like that, you put it on the refrigerator and

472
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.410
it just never sticks because the magnets are never strong

473
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.098
enough. And then another universe, you get,

474
00:30:49.318 --> 00:30:52.939
um, a magnet for your favorite football team.

475
00:30:52.949 --> 00:30:55.900
You put on a refrigerator and then that football team

476
00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.140
does terribly like they keep, you know, uh

477
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.000
losing like, oh, I, I'm gonna support

478
00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:03.108
another football team. You try to take the first

479
00:31:03.118 --> 00:31:07.088
magnet off, but it's impossible because it's stuck on

480
00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:10.939
there forever because the magnetism is so strong. So

481
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.380
, you know, we're lucky, we're in a

482
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:17.439
universe where you can take refrigerator magnets on and off

483
00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:18.318
and they'll stick as long as you want to.

484
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:21.400
But then if you wanna take them off, you

485
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.989
can take them off. But let me just ask

486
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.719
you 11 more question about uh dimension. So,

487
00:31:29.979 --> 00:31:33.949
is it possible in any way to, I mean

488
00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:37.979
, to test that out empirically, to detect them

489
00:31:37.989 --> 00:31:41.539
empirically or, or is this something that we just

490
00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:48.189
are able to figure out mathematically well with these unseen

491
00:31:48.199 --> 00:31:53.670
dimensions? Um The whole theory is designed so that

492
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.608
these dimensions would be undetectable. But then of course

493
00:31:57.618 --> 00:31:59.930
, people will say, well, then how do

494
00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:01.160
you prove it? Well, then you try to

495
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.439
look for what's called, what are called low energy

496
00:32:05.449 --> 00:32:10.150
ramifications So string theory operates, it lives on a

497
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.939
very, very high energy scale. So um if

498
00:32:14.949 --> 00:32:17.229
you um if, if you want to see string

499
00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:21.519
theory, you know, don't know, don't really

500
00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:25.039
uh have the possibility of creating uh colliders on earth

501
00:32:25.049 --> 00:32:28.578
or even in the solar system that would be strong

502
00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:31.059
enough to produce those ultra high energies. But then

503
00:32:31.068 --> 00:32:34.250
people say, well, maybe you can see a

504
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:39.479
slight change in the results due to the higher dimensions

505
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:45.568
. So there are theories that predict you would see

506
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.328
a slight difference in the outcome of a collision experiment

507
00:32:50.588 --> 00:32:52.868
due to the fact that there are more dimensions in

508
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.739
space. So those are the things people are trying

509
00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:00.189
to test for these subtle differences. And so far

510
00:33:00.199 --> 00:33:02.380
, these haven't been found. Um that would be

511
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.910
Nobel Prize winning material. If you could show that

512
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.199
a collision experiment, you get a difference that's significant

513
00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:13.680
enough to show that some of the energy, for

514
00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:16.959
example, escaped into a higher dimension. And when

515
00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:21.618
it comes to the origins of our own universe and

516
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.049
the Big Bang, which is something you referred to

517
00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:30.729
earlier. I mean, what is the most accepted

518
00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:35.689
uh explanation for the origins of our universe or the

519
00:33:35.699 --> 00:33:39.150
way that the Big Bang occurred or played out?

520
00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:45.380
So, um physicists, most physicists don't talk about

521
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:51.400
what happens before the Big Bang because um as people

522
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.380
like Stephen Hawking proved in the 19 sixties, the

523
00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:59.858
actual Big Bang event would be a singularity So nothing

524
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.410
would be detective before then. Now that said there

525
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.759
are other theories about cosmic cycles that there were other

526
00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:12.717
cycles of creation. But the standard Big Bang theory

527
00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:16.768
is that it's a singularity that time began essentially at

528
00:34:16.778 --> 00:34:20.798
that point. So we can't really talk about before

529
00:34:20.809 --> 00:34:24.617
the Big Bang. And then space came into existence

530
00:34:25.157 --> 00:34:29.088
during the time of the Big Bang time came to

531
00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:36.000
existence and then the universe immediately began expanding. But

532
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.969
then um at this point, there was a certain

533
00:34:38.978 --> 00:34:42.539
amount of energy in the universe, a certain amount

534
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.989
of energy background. And one thing um that was

535
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.188
found in the early universe is something with a technical

536
00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.168
name. It's called a scalar field. And a

537
00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.728
scalar field sounds like, you know, something very

538
00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:01.010
mathematical. But in reality, it just means that

539
00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:05.789
you have a map of energy that's different from point

540
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.699
to point. Kind of like if you were going

541
00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:12.918
mountain climbing and you wanted to find out which were

542
00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:15.639
the highest peaks which were the lowest peaks. And

543
00:35:15.648 --> 00:35:17.389
what would be the best way to climb up a

544
00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:22.780
mountain? You might have a topographical map and that

545
00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:27.519
topographical map would tell you the elevation at every point

546
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.688
. So it might say, OK, this point

547
00:35:29.699 --> 00:35:32.969
is 500 m high. This point is 1000 m

548
00:35:32.978 --> 00:35:37.409
high. This point is more, this point is

549
00:35:37.418 --> 00:35:40.610
less and then you can plan your walk and your

550
00:35:40.619 --> 00:35:45.559
hike um up the mountain based on the topographical map

551
00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:47.909
. Well, if you look at the early universe

552
00:35:47.918 --> 00:35:52.128
right after the Big Bang, you could map out

553
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.090
its energy and that would give you what we call

554
00:35:55.099 --> 00:36:00.579
a scalar field. And if that energy has a

555
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:05.599
certain profile, meaning it has a certain level,

556
00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:09.289
um and that level persists for a while and slowly

557
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.699
changes over time, then that, that bump in

558
00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:22.280
energy um causes expansion super rapid expansion at that particular

559
00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:27.019
point in space. So if you have a certain

560
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.769
energy profile, that's, that's flat for a certain

561
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.110
period of time, meaning it would be kind of

562
00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:37.099
like you have, you know, uh you climb

563
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.599
up a mountain and then you have this flat plateau

564
00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:45.949
where things are pretty much level that triggers the universe

565
00:36:45.958 --> 00:36:50.329
space in the universe to start expanding really rapidly.

566
00:36:50.409 --> 00:36:53.590
It's just a result of Einstein's general theory of relativity

567
00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:58.469
which says that space expands depending upon what's in it

568
00:36:58.728 --> 00:37:00.489
, what mass is in it, what energy is

569
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.438
in it. So space starts to expand rapidly that

570
00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:07.119
stretches out that part of the universe and that's called

571
00:37:07.128 --> 00:37:13.409
inflation and that happens super rapidly. And suddenly when

572
00:37:13.418 --> 00:37:19.469
um when things uh expand enough, um the universe

573
00:37:20.148 --> 00:37:24.469
no longer um sits in that energy zone that,

574
00:37:24.478 --> 00:37:29.659
that it it it's no longer subject to that scalar

575
00:37:29.668 --> 00:37:34.849
energy field um which, which has evolved slowly over

576
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.090
time. Um And that you no longer have inflationary

577
00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:45.139
period, that enormous amount of energy created by that

578
00:37:45.148 --> 00:37:49.668
super rapid expansion turns into all these particles. So

579
00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:52.869
all the particles that we see today, you know

580
00:37:52.878 --> 00:37:57.228
, light particles called photons, the particles we know

581
00:37:57.239 --> 00:38:00.909
as electrons the quarks. And this whole zoo of

582
00:38:00.918 --> 00:38:06.510
particles is created at the exact moment that inflation stops

583
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.019
. And all this energy turns into matter. Uh

584
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:14.539
following E equals MC squared energy is matter times the

585
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.360
speed of light squared as Einstein said, so then

586
00:38:17.369 --> 00:38:22.070
that's when the the physical universe with all of the

587
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:27.148
particles is created. But as Andre Linde said,

588
00:38:27.429 --> 00:38:30.769
um this might happen in other parts of the early

589
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.500
cosmos creating other inflationary events and other universes. And

590
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:39.840
that's where you get the multiverse picture. Mhm So

591
00:38:39.878 --> 00:38:44.918
I I mean, is that idea that we sometimes

592
00:38:44.929 --> 00:38:52.550
see or read about in popular science publications uh where

593
00:38:52.559 --> 00:38:55.119
I mean, if a uni if a multiverse is

594
00:38:55.128 --> 00:39:00.708
real, it is usually depicted visually as different uh

595
00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:06.090
bubbles or different spheres. And then uh we read

596
00:39:06.099 --> 00:39:09.989
that uh basically what could have happened is that two

597
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
of them or perhaps even more collide with and when

598
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.469
they collide they create a new universe or they provoke

599
00:39:19.478 --> 00:39:22.510
what would be a big bang? And the a

600
00:39:22.519 --> 00:39:25.260
new universe uh is created from that, I mean

601
00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:31.458
, does that have uh any support in actual physics

602
00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:36.659
or not? Well, there are ideas of higher

603
00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:43.869
dimensional planes called membranes or brains for short colliding along

604
00:39:43.878 --> 00:39:45.458
a higher dimension. That's a different idea that was

605
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:52.739
proposed by Neil Turret Paul Steinhardt and others uh around

606
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:58.019
uh 2000. And uh that's called a cyclic cosmology

607
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.188
. And that's an alternative to inflation and inflation,

608
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:05.369
the bubbles expand and they could collide. But when

609
00:40:05.378 --> 00:40:07.289
they collide, they don't really create a new universe

610
00:40:07.458 --> 00:40:12.128
, they create, maybe create a little scar.

611
00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:16.039
So when two universes collide, they might create some

612
00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:22.168
disruption in matter and energy and that theoretically could be

613
00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:28.239
seen in a uh kind of rings scar like rings

614
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.840
in the cosmic microwave background. And scientists are trying

615
00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:37.389
to look for these rings that are relics of early

616
00:40:37.398 --> 00:40:40.519
collisions between us and another universe. So that is

617
00:40:40.648 --> 00:40:45.438
one way of trying to uh physically prove the existence

618
00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:50.119
of a multiverse. So um in, in my

619
00:40:50.128 --> 00:40:54.239
book, I talked interviewed Jana P Pols who's uh

620
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:59.340
who's a researcher at the University of London, who

621
00:40:59.349 --> 00:41:02.250
uh her team is trying to look for uh evidence

622
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:07.760
of of bubble collisions in the early universe. And

623
00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:10.208
also their latest project is to try to simulate this

624
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:17.570
computationally and do black holes connect in any way to

625
00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:22.050
the multiverse or not? Well, there is a

626
00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:28.579
theory um by Lise Mullen, uh a physicist that

627
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.349
um black holes uh they, they, they are

628
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.539
known to be extreme events in the universe. And

629
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:42.489
um I if you look at um uh standard general

630
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.648
relativity, we say that the more mass you have

631
00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:49.679
concentrated in a point, the more space time warps

632
00:41:49.898 --> 00:41:52.489
. Well, for black holes, you have an

633
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.590
infinite warping. So it creates what can look like

634
00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:00.458
a tear or a hole in the fabric of space

635
00:42:00.469 --> 00:42:06.949
time. And um there are ways to mathematically connect

636
00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:13.128
the black hole with another part of space and create

637
00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:15.969
a kind of a um you know, what could

638
00:42:15.978 --> 00:42:17.809
be a connection with another part of our universe.

639
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:22.639
And some speculate that it could create a new universe

640
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:25.619
uh like uh as Lise Mullen called it a baby

641
00:42:25.628 --> 00:42:30.889
universe and that this baby universe could grow up into

642
00:42:30.128 --> 00:42:34.208
a big universe and then create more black holes.

643
00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:37.199
And he has this idea of survival of the fittest

644
00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:42.000
where the universe that creates the most black holes is

645
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:46.418
evolutionary fitter than other universes because uh it also creates

646
00:42:46.429 --> 00:42:51.610
um more stars and more planets and more, more

647
00:42:51.619 --> 00:42:53.349
likelihood for life. So that's a really interesting idea

648
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:59.840
, but that's not really the thrust of uh most

649
00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:02.179
researchers who do, who study the multiverse as more

650
00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:07.148
of an idea of, of one researcher and does

651
00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:12.510
the science and philosophy of counter factuals uh have anything

652
00:43:12.519 --> 00:43:16.628
to do with the idea of a multiverse. Well

653
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.570
, yes. Uh So in philosophy, we can

654
00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:25.050
speculate upon all the possibilities that are out there.

655
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:30.039
And uh that was, you know, done all

656
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.378
the way back to people like philosophers like Leibnitz.

657
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:39.728
So Leibnitz talked about all the possible universes out there

658
00:43:40.228 --> 00:43:44.409
that he, he talked about the divine or God

659
00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:50.938
thinking about all these other possibilities. But of course

660
00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:53.429
, God is uh as, as he would say

661
00:43:53.438 --> 00:43:59.289
, perfect in his wisdom and chose from all these

662
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.260
among these other possibilities, the best possibility for us

663
00:44:04.398 --> 00:44:07.070
, the best of all possible worlds. But he

664
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.929
imagined all these other worlds out there, you know

665
00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:15.789
, where earth was brutally hot and unpleasant and you

666
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.909
know, food was unappetizing and people were, you

667
00:44:20.918 --> 00:44:24.458
know, uh you know, these unthinking beings.

668
00:44:24.469 --> 00:44:28.239
But in his wisdom, he said, OK,

669
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:32.570
we want a world which is pleasant, as nice

670
00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:37.750
climate, as nice oceans. And as people who

671
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.829
are kind of a little bit like, you know

672
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.168
, a little bit like the divine because they can

673
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.969
make choices and so forth. So Leibniz kind of

674
00:44:45.989 --> 00:44:49.699
talked about this idea of the best of all possible

675
00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:53.688
worlds. And the writer, uh Voltaire famously satirized

676
00:44:53.699 --> 00:44:59.188
this idea with his character Candide. Uh So as

677
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:00.809
this novel Candide, where he had a character named

678
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.530
Pangloss who was a philosopher who would no matter what

679
00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:08.610
happened, there could be an earthquake. Um In

680
00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:10.309
fact, I think he talked about the, the

681
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.668
great earthquake in Lisbon and uh you know, it's

682
00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:16.849
horrible earthquake. And he said, well, you

683
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.809
know, it must be the best possibility because God

684
00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:22.929
meant us to be in the best of all possible

685
00:45:22.938 --> 00:45:25.260
worlds. So even if, even if you know

686
00:45:25.269 --> 00:45:29.219
where there's all this suffering, it still works out

687
00:45:29.228 --> 00:45:31.090
for the best. And uh Voltaire thought that was

688
00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:36.228
very amusing that a philosopher would say anything is,

689
00:45:36.289 --> 00:45:39.280
is always the best outcome. Mhm So one of

690
00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:42.969
the questions that you also explore in the book is

691
00:45:42.978 --> 00:45:50.289
how explaining why the universe is habitable uh uh as

692
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.438
something to do with the idea of the multiverse.

693
00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:57.250
So what's the connection there or the possible connection?

694
00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:00.840
Well, this was an idea called the Anthropic Principle

695
00:46:00.898 --> 00:46:05.750
developed by Brandon Carter who was someone who was at

696
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.829
Cambridge. He, he was a friend of Stephen

697
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:14.099
Hawking. And uh you know, Cambridge was this

698
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.469
really hot area for cosmology. It still is.

699
00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:22.228
But in the 19 seventies, uh Cambridge and Princeton

700
00:46:22.369 --> 00:46:25.550
were two of the best places to go in Princeton

701
00:46:25.559 --> 00:46:29.519
. You had uh John Wheeler in Cambridge, you

702
00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.719
had people like Hawking and Penrose and Brandon Carter was

703
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.289
also there. And Carter also spent some time at

704
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.168
Princeton. So we got to know John Wheeler and

705
00:46:39.179 --> 00:46:44.389
he found out about Hugh Everett's uh idea of the

706
00:46:44.398 --> 00:46:49.579
many worlds interpretation. So that got Brandon Carter thinking

707
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.329
about the multiverse, although it wasn't called as such

708
00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:55.159
. And he thought, well, there's all these

709
00:46:55.168 --> 00:47:00.309
questions, cosmology about uh parameters like why certain physical

710
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.820
parameters should have certain values. And that's called the

711
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:09.090
fine tuning problem. Because if the strength of electromagnetism

712
00:47:09.099 --> 00:47:13.559
was different, you wouldn't have uh you know,

713
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.840
for example, atoms, you know, being stable

714
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:20.760
. If you had, for example, the charge

715
00:47:20.769 --> 00:47:22.530
of a proton being slightly different than a charge of

716
00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:27.688
electron, then you know, the atoms would collapse

717
00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:30.969
. So there are all these coincidences in the universe

718
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:35.579
, things that um if you change slightly, the

719
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:39.300
universe would not be suitable for life. And Brendan

720
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:40.668
Carter said, hey, wait a minute, what

721
00:47:40.679 --> 00:47:45.353
if there's all these other units versus out there where

722
00:47:45.364 --> 00:47:50.304
things are different? But the fact that our universe

723
00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:55.934
eventually leads to stable planets, um thriving stars and

724
00:47:55.945 --> 00:48:00.563
um life and, and particularly intelligent life that can

725
00:48:00.574 --> 00:48:06.289
talk about the universe. Uh Maybe that restricts this

726
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.250
range of possibilities down to one universe. And they

727
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:15.019
call that the anthropic principle for the Latin anthroposophy and

728
00:48:15.369 --> 00:48:24.599
some others said, well, maybe that term is

729
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.570
a little bit misleading because you don't just need people

730
00:48:28.579 --> 00:48:30.969
, you just need stability, stable, stable planets

731
00:48:31.269 --> 00:48:36.208
and life. Um You could have other beings um

732
00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:39.409
observe it. But um but anyway, that's uh

733
00:48:39.418 --> 00:48:44.409
one idea of the multiverse is uh this idea of

734
00:48:44.418 --> 00:48:49.398
the anthropic principle and it explains why um you have

735
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:53.750
a universe that supports habitable worlds and does the idea

736
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.110
of the multiverse connect in any way to a potential

737
00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:04.668
theory of everything or a simple unified explanation of the

738
00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:08.969
natural forces. Well, um this is what we

739
00:49:08.978 --> 00:49:13.800
call the holy grail of physics or the ultimate goal

740
00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:16.958
of physics is to create a theory that unites all

741
00:49:16.969 --> 00:49:21.648
of the natural forces into a single simple set of

742
00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:27.099
equations. And uh it's an elusive goal because um

743
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:30.500
we made great progress in uh the 19 sixties and

744
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:36.119
19 seventies with developing the Standard Model and the standard

745
00:49:36.128 --> 00:49:39.489
model includes the electro weak unification, which very,

746
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:44.300
very nicely unites electromagnetism with the weak force. The

747
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:47.500
weak force is the force that explains radioactivity. And

748
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:52.469
of course, electromagnetism explains why charges uh attract to

749
00:49:52.478 --> 00:49:55.699
repel and why magnets attract to repel. All of

750
00:49:55.708 --> 00:50:00.570
those can be explained with a single theory that is

751
00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:04.889
also uh consistent with quantum physics and it's very,

752
00:50:04.898 --> 00:50:10.050
very accurate. So electro weak uh predictions are as

753
00:50:10.059 --> 00:50:14.110
accurate as any experiment that's been ever been done.

754
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:16.699
So it's extremely successful. Now, we also have

755
00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:22.530
the strong nuclear force which explains why atomic nuclei are

756
00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:28.188
stable. And there's a theory for that called quantum

757
00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:31.510
chromodynamics, which is a very, very successful theory

758
00:50:31.679 --> 00:50:37.559
. Um And um it's not as well tested,

759
00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:42.050
I should say as electro weak, but it also

760
00:50:42.059 --> 00:50:45.159
has very similar properties to electro week and involves this

761
00:50:45.168 --> 00:50:50.500
idea of uh two types of, of entities.

762
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:54.840
One is the matter particles quarks, electrons and so

763
00:50:54.849 --> 00:50:59.550
forth. And then you have force carrying particles which

764
00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:05.918
are particles that are um conveyed from one particle ma

765
00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:08.708
matter particle to another. So they're exchanged just like

766
00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:14.820
throwing a ball to matter particles, throw in a

767
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:19.280
sense, a force uh carrier back and forth and

768
00:51:19.289 --> 00:51:22.199
that creates a force. So you have uh a

769
00:51:22.208 --> 00:51:24.168
, a bunch of force carriers, you have photons

770
00:51:24.179 --> 00:51:30.168
which carry electromagnetic force, you have the WW particle

771
00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:32.050
and Z particles which carry the weak force and you

772
00:51:32.059 --> 00:51:36.010
have gluons which carry the strong force. Now,

773
00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:39.809
in principle, we should have gravity should be described

774
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.378
using a force carrying particle which some people have called

775
00:51:44.389 --> 00:51:49.438
graviton. But no one has successfully developed a quantum

776
00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:54.070
theory of gravitation that is uh testable and describes,

777
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.378
you know what we measure in the universe. There

778
00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:00.409
are a lot of ideas out there for quantum gravitation

779
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:07.398
and then the theory of everything would describe quantum gravity

780
00:52:07.478 --> 00:52:09.478
in a way that's consistent with all the other forces

781
00:52:09.489 --> 00:52:14.418
and unify all those into a quantum theory of all

782
00:52:14.429 --> 00:52:19.438
particles and all forces. And the leading candidate for

783
00:52:19.449 --> 00:52:22.820
that is string theory. But as I mentioned,

784
00:52:22.019 --> 00:52:25.369
uh string theory has all these possibilities, 10 to

785
00:52:25.378 --> 00:52:31.079
the 500 string uh geometries. And each of those

786
00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:37.199
creates its own uh theory of physics of and leads

787
00:52:37.208 --> 00:52:39.550
to a diff different parameters for the Standard model.

788
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:45.250
So those need to be significantly narrowed down to create

789
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.550
a theory of everything where the multiverse comes into play

790
00:52:47.668 --> 00:52:52.110
is you can say, OK, there's all these

791
00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:55.139
possibilities out there, there's all these theories out there

792
00:52:55.559 --> 00:52:59.739
. But the theory of everything that happens to correspond

793
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.659
to our universe was narrowed down by the fact that

794
00:53:04.668 --> 00:53:07.000
we are here using the anthropic principle, we can

795
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.500
say, well, there are many, many,

796
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:14.139
many, many different theories of everything, but there's

797
00:53:14.148 --> 00:53:17.780
one that matches a universe that creates planets that creates

798
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:22.820
stars, creates intelligent life. And that's our particular

799
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:25.228
theory of everything. And that's you know why we

800
00:53:25.239 --> 00:53:30.579
have these particular parameters, different strengths of different constants

801
00:53:30.889 --> 00:53:34.128
. And that in, in, in theory,

802
00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:38.668
narrows everything down to one universe and explains why we

803
00:53:38.679 --> 00:53:43.429
are living in this one universe and explains, you

804
00:53:43.438 --> 00:53:45.989
know, all the constants for our universe. Well

805
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.059
, we're very, very far from that. That's

806
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:51.478
kind of an idealization. That's the goal, but

807
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:54.050
no one has ever come up with a way to

808
00:53:54.059 --> 00:54:00.699
narrow everything down to one possibility. But what are

809
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:07.739
perhaps the main difficulties with integrating gravity with quantum physics

810
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:12.469
? What are the bigger obstacles there? Well,

811
00:54:12.478 --> 00:54:17.079
the biggest obstacle is mathematical um so back in the

812
00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:22.829
19 forties, um physicists such as Richard Feynman,

813
00:54:23.148 --> 00:54:30.050
Julian Schwinger and Si Tiro Tomonaga in Japan developed what

814
00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:37.719
are called uh renormalization methods in quantum electrodynamics. Now

815
00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:39.958
that is a very technical term, but basically what

816
00:54:39.969 --> 00:54:46.059
that means is that you can take two electrons which

817
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:51.030
are char basic charge particles. And you say,

818
00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:54.510
OK, let's develop a quantum theory of how these

819
00:54:54.519 --> 00:54:59.918
electrons interact with each other. And the way they

820
00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:02.579
interact with each other is by exchanging a light particle

821
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:07.148
called a photon. And then you say, OK

822
00:55:07.159 --> 00:55:10.188
, you have an electron gives off a photon,

823
00:55:10.659 --> 00:55:15.679
that photon is absorbed by another electron. And then

824
00:55:15.688 --> 00:55:19.329
that electron acquires a certain amount of energy acquires a

825
00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.309
certain amount of momentum. And then you could predict

826
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.179
the ways where the electron will end up. And

827
00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:30.590
that's called scattering scattering is when you have two particles

828
00:55:30.648 --> 00:55:32.329
, you predict, you know where they end up

829
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.418
what angles, what's the probability they'll end up at

830
00:55:36.429 --> 00:55:38.769
certain angles. And that's something you can physically measure

831
00:55:39.099 --> 00:55:43.659
the scattering, you physically measure where these particles end

832
00:55:43.668 --> 00:55:46.378
up. You test test it according to theory.

833
00:55:46.438 --> 00:55:52.519
And in the 19 forties, quantum electrodynamics showed how

834
00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:57.590
you can add up all the possible ways electrons interact

835
00:55:58.208 --> 00:56:00.860
and using something called Feynman diagrams, which is a

836
00:56:00.869 --> 00:56:06.070
neat way of adding up all the possibilities. And

837
00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:13.869
then using mathematical methods, get rid of infinite terms

838
00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:17.320
that pop up. So if you do these calculations

839
00:56:17.429 --> 00:56:23.719
with particles, because particles are infinitesimal, they really

840
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:30.938
elementary particles are not only tiny, but they're believed

841
00:56:30.949 --> 00:56:34.500
in this theory to be, you know, mathematically

842
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:37.228
have zero size. So if you put that into

843
00:56:37.239 --> 00:56:42.389
the theory, you get infinite terms because one divided

844
00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:46.840
by zero is infinity um or unlimited. So what

845
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:52.280
during these calculations before a five inch ring or Toman

846
00:56:52.289 --> 00:56:53.590
NAA, they found these infinite terms, but they

847
00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:59.369
were able to use a method called renormalization which basically

848
00:56:59.418 --> 00:57:02.389
matches terms, subtracts them so that you get rid

849
00:57:02.398 --> 00:57:05.909
of all the infinite terms. And that's renormalization.

850
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:08.789
And when electro the weak theory was developed in 19

851
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.809
sixties and 19 seventies, it was shown that you

852
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.458
could also match up terms, subtract them out and

853
00:57:15.469 --> 00:57:21.708
then get um get uh a a finite amount.

854
00:57:21.918 --> 00:57:25.250
And I use a nice analogy in my book about

855
00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:31.648
um how renormalization works? I imagine a couple two

856
00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:36.909
people and they're living together and one of them earns

857
00:57:36.918 --> 00:57:40.579
money and every week gets a paycheck and she adds

858
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:45.320
up all the money she earns o throughout a lifetime

859
00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:49.228
. And she imagines that she, she lives indefinitely

860
00:57:49.239 --> 00:57:51.829
. Um It's just a hypothetical. So would make

861
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.139
an infinite amount of money. And the other person

862
00:57:55.378 --> 00:58:00.929
is spending each, each month and the spending would

863
00:58:00.938 --> 00:58:02.289
be infinite. And if you say, hey,

864
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.590
wait a minute, this doesn't add up in the

865
00:58:06.599 --> 00:58:12.219
bookkeeping infinite income, but an infinite amount of spending

866
00:58:12.599 --> 00:58:14.619
, that doesn't make any sense. But if you

867
00:58:14.628 --> 00:58:17.090
say, OK, every month, one person brings

868
00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:21.300
in the paycheck, the other person spends it and

869
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:24.458
that creates a finite amount each month. So that

870
00:58:24.469 --> 00:58:29.260
so therefore everything matches up in the in the bookkeeping

871
00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.570
. So the accounting works out similarly, you can

872
00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:35.699
do in a kind of accounting in particle physics with

873
00:58:35.708 --> 00:58:38.019
electromagnetism and the weak force in which everything gives you

874
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.260
a finite result. Well, it turns out with

875
00:58:40.269 --> 00:58:44.739
gravity, you try to do this and you don't

876
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.719
get, you can't match up the terms you keep

877
00:58:47.728 --> 00:58:52.050
getting infinite answers. And the only way around it

878
00:58:52.059 --> 00:58:57.590
as far as physicists can tell is to say,

879
00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:01.789
there's no such thing as infinite decimal that every particle

880
00:59:01.969 --> 00:59:06.539
must have a finite size. And that leads to

881
00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:12.329
the idea of finite strands which are known as strings

882
00:59:12.619 --> 00:59:15.269
at that vibrate instead of particles. So that leads

883
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:19.829
to string theory. And string theory is finite So

884
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.449
you don't get infinite number of uh you know,

885
00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:25.469
get infinite terms. But then um you have all

886
00:59:25.478 --> 00:59:29.208
these possibilities for string theory. So you have to

887
00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:31.159
narrow things down. So that's the problem with string

888
00:59:31.168 --> 00:59:37.188
theory of so many options. So earlier, I've

889
00:59:37.199 --> 00:59:39.309
asked you about the Big Bang and the origins of

890
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.500
our universe. But how about the future of our

891
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:50.610
universe? What are perhaps the main hypothesis that physicists

892
00:59:50.619 --> 00:59:53.309
have proposed for the future of our universe? And

893
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.989
is it that one of them has more support than

894
00:59:58.000 --> 00:60:00.489
the others? I mean, basically, what do

895
00:60:00.500 --> 00:60:04.159
we know at this point about the possible future of

896
00:60:04.168 --> 00:60:08.269
our universe? Well, until the 19 nineties,

897
00:60:08.280 --> 00:60:12.708
um you know, I should say between the 19

898
00:60:13.159 --> 00:60:15.010
, late, late 19 twenties or 19 thirties and

899
00:60:15.019 --> 00:60:20.019
19 nineties, the basic idea was that the universe

900
00:60:20.030 --> 00:60:24.250
had three options. One of them is that expands

901
00:60:24.668 --> 00:60:31.550
and then um eventually collapses. And then the second

902
00:60:31.559 --> 00:60:37.369
possibility is that expands and the expansion slows down but

903
00:60:37.418 --> 00:60:40.429
slows down very gradually. And the expansion keeps going

904
00:60:40.679 --> 00:60:44.750
. And the third option was kind of in between

905
00:60:44.760 --> 00:60:49.289
the two that the universe al almost collapses, not

906
00:60:49.300 --> 00:60:52.699
quite collapses and keeps slowing down and slowing down,

907
00:60:52.750 --> 00:60:58.159
but never quite collapses. But then in 1998 these

908
00:60:58.168 --> 00:61:02.320
two teams of astronomers discovered using measurements of exploding stars

909
00:61:02.329 --> 00:61:06.458
or supernova that the universe is speeding up in its

910
00:61:06.469 --> 00:61:10.010
expansion. And that's called cosmic acceleration. And that

911
00:61:10.019 --> 00:61:14.728
means that you have 1/4 option, which is that

912
00:61:14.739 --> 00:61:19.639
the universe will keep expanding forever, but not only

913
00:61:19.648 --> 00:61:22.188
that, but will speed up in its expansion.

914
00:61:22.550 --> 00:61:25.898
And eventually just everything will just keep getting more and

915
00:61:25.909 --> 00:61:30.829
more dilute and that Galaxies will get further and further

916
00:61:30.840 --> 00:61:35.139
apart. And then finally, our set of Galaxies

917
00:61:35.148 --> 00:61:38.878
will be a hermit, meaning like a loner in

918
00:61:38.889 --> 00:61:42.418
, in the universe and we won't even see any

919
00:61:42.429 --> 00:61:45.418
other Galaxies, we'll only see our galaxy and maybe

920
00:61:45.539 --> 00:61:50.119
a few others in the vicinity. And uh that

921
00:61:50.128 --> 00:61:53.829
is called the sometimes called a big whimper scenario uh

922
00:61:54.320 --> 00:62:00.559
from the Ts Elliot Poe poem. Um that you

923
00:62:00.570 --> 00:62:01.539
know how's the world ends? Not with a bang

924
00:62:01.550 --> 00:62:05.429
, but with a whimper. Um it's a line

925
00:62:05.438 --> 00:62:08.168
from Matthias Elliott poem. But um there's an even

926
00:62:08.179 --> 00:62:14.978
scarier uh possibility called The Big Rip. And that

927
00:62:14.989 --> 00:62:19.978
is that um whatever is, is causing acceleration keeps

928
00:62:19.989 --> 00:62:23.659
getting stronger and stronger. And then eventually everything is

929
00:62:23.668 --> 00:62:29.909
ripped apart, including planets are torn apart, stars

930
00:62:29.918 --> 00:62:34.059
are torn apart and even the atoms in people's bodies

931
00:62:34.070 --> 00:62:37.179
are torn apart. So everything is torn to shreds

932
00:62:37.188 --> 00:62:38.918
and that will be the end of the universe.

933
00:62:39.070 --> 00:62:44.289
Now, those are some possibilities in the standard model

934
00:62:44.570 --> 00:62:46.909
of, of cosmology. But then if you believe

935
00:62:46.918 --> 00:62:52.128
in cyclic universes, I believe in, um for

936
00:62:52.139 --> 00:62:55.110
example, the idea of Steinhardt and Turek that the

937
00:62:55.119 --> 00:63:01.688
universe is um uh cyclical because you have uh two

938
00:63:01.699 --> 00:63:07.019
membranes also known as brains colliding with each other periodically

939
00:63:07.030 --> 00:63:10.188
and clashing with each other. Um There would be

940
00:63:10.199 --> 00:63:15.809
a periodic phase in which these two like, it's

941
00:63:15.820 --> 00:63:19.500
like hyper planes or planes in a higher dimension,

942
00:63:19.840 --> 00:63:22.760
collide with each other, wipe everything out and reset

943
00:63:22.769 --> 00:63:27.208
the universe. And that would be um the end

944
00:63:27.219 --> 00:63:29.849
of everything, but that would start a new phase

945
00:63:29.860 --> 00:63:32.719
of the universe. And then finally, there's Roger

946
00:63:32.728 --> 00:63:37.550
Penrose idea, a different kind of cycle where at

947
00:63:37.559 --> 00:63:42.449
the end of the universe, there's emptiness, everything

948
00:63:42.458 --> 00:63:46.519
becomes more and more dilute all the particles uh evaporate

949
00:63:46.530 --> 00:63:50.909
. And then eventually you have sheer emptiness, but

950
00:63:50.918 --> 00:63:54.800
that emptiness um has a kind of identity crisis and

951
00:63:54.809 --> 00:64:00.378
it mathematically and instead of thinking of itself is very

952
00:64:00.389 --> 00:64:03.398
large, it thinks of itself as very small and

953
00:64:03.409 --> 00:64:08.159
there's just mathematical transition and then creates a new phase

954
00:64:08.168 --> 00:64:10.679
of the universe. So you have a new cycle

955
00:64:10.750 --> 00:64:13.918
. So those are some of the ideas about the

956
00:64:13.929 --> 00:64:17.119
end of time and you know, either destruction and

957
00:64:17.128 --> 00:64:19.849
recreation of the universe or just the destruction of the

958
00:64:19.860 --> 00:64:25.010
universe. And is there or I I mean,

959
00:64:25.019 --> 00:64:30.369
what is the likelihood that whatever kind of scenario will

960
00:64:30.378 --> 00:64:36.128
occur and the universe will still be able to sustain

961
00:64:36.139 --> 00:64:42.010
life and perhaps even worse uh being able to sustain

962
00:64:42.059 --> 00:64:47.599
intelligent life like us? Well, so, so

963
00:64:47.610 --> 00:64:50.239
we, we believe in, in, you know

964
00:64:50.250 --> 00:64:56.179
, the current standard cosmology that the universe is expanding

965
00:64:56.320 --> 00:65:00.938
faster and faster. And that um but also that

966
00:65:00.949 --> 00:65:03.579
something called entropy, which is a measure of disorderly

967
00:65:03.590 --> 00:65:09.019
energy is increasing. And that means that stars will

968
00:65:09.030 --> 00:65:14.389
eventually burn out and the sun will eventually die if

969
00:65:14.398 --> 00:65:16.510
the sun dies. We imagine that maybe we have

970
00:65:16.519 --> 00:65:19.918
spaceships that take us to another star, but then

971
00:65:19.929 --> 00:65:23.389
that star might die. So then we go to

972
00:65:23.398 --> 00:65:28.030
a third star and we keep going and uh maybe

973
00:65:28.039 --> 00:65:30.070
all the stars in our galaxy die. And maybe

974
00:65:30.079 --> 00:65:33.728
we have, you know, uh not only interstellar

975
00:65:33.739 --> 00:65:38.800
travel but intergalactic travel, we try another galaxy,

976
00:65:38.949 --> 00:65:45.699
but eventually all of these Galaxies stars will either um

977
00:65:45.079 --> 00:65:49.699
you know, become uh so cold, they,

978
00:65:49.708 --> 00:65:55.378
they can't support life or turn into black holes and

979
00:65:55.389 --> 00:65:59.949
so forth. So then the question is, can

980
00:65:59.958 --> 00:66:04.489
intelligent life survive? And that was answered um at

981
00:66:04.648 --> 00:66:10.438
one point by Roger Penrose who speculated that maybe we

982
00:66:10.449 --> 00:66:15.239
will develop ways to transform our uh intelligence, our

983
00:66:15.500 --> 00:66:20.590
consciousness into maybe, um you know, artificial intelligence

984
00:66:20.958 --> 00:66:24.789
or robots and that could live in under very,

985
00:66:24.800 --> 00:66:28.438
very cold circumstances. But I'm not sure if that

986
00:66:28.449 --> 00:66:30.329
would be quite as satisfying to say that life would

987
00:66:30.340 --> 00:66:34.469
be in these robots that, you know, exist

988
00:66:34.478 --> 00:66:36.789
in, in, in ultra cold temperatures. It's

989
00:66:36.800 --> 00:66:41.000
not the kind of life that we, that most

990
00:66:41.010 --> 00:66:44.590
people would want to live. Yeah, for sure

991
00:66:44.688 --> 00:66:47.159
. And uh if a multiverse is real, would

992
00:66:47.168 --> 00:66:51.239
it have any bearing on the future of our own

993
00:66:51.250 --> 00:66:56.869
universe? Uh Well, we, if the multiverse

994
00:66:56.878 --> 00:67:01.590
, the cosmological multiverse is real, um unless uh

995
00:67:01.599 --> 00:67:06.590
there's some collision with another universe that happens to hit

996
00:67:06.599 --> 00:67:11.590
our part of the observable universe, probably it wouldn't

997
00:67:11.599 --> 00:67:15.090
affect us very much. We would just know that

998
00:67:15.099 --> 00:67:17.449
there are other universes out there that might have different

999
00:67:17.458 --> 00:67:23.148
fates than our universe. Uh So, uh might

1000
00:67:23.159 --> 00:67:26.739
not, might not affect us very much. Um

1001
00:67:27.239 --> 00:67:30.438
in terms of the quantum multiverse of the many worlds

1002
00:67:30.579 --> 00:67:38.619
possibility, um It's possible that we would have other

1003
00:67:38.628 --> 00:67:44.978
versions of ourselves that might have slightly different um fates

1004
00:67:44.989 --> 00:67:48.478
in life. Um You know, if let's say

1005
00:67:48.489 --> 00:67:56.708
during a quantum event uh that somehow affected um the

1006
00:67:56.719 --> 00:68:00.188
rest of our lives, it's unlikely that um an

1007
00:68:00.199 --> 00:68:03.909
obs a single quantum observation will make a big difference

1008
00:68:03.918 --> 00:68:09.469
in our lives. But it's hypothetically possible that by

1009
00:68:09.478 --> 00:68:13.349
making a different observation that that could affect our lives

1010
00:68:13.360 --> 00:68:17.318
and steer our lives on a different course. And

1011
00:68:17.328 --> 00:68:21.337
so, of course, in science fiction, many

1012
00:68:21.349 --> 00:68:27.358
times, people use the idea of time traveling and

1013
00:68:27.368 --> 00:68:30.377
depict it in different ways in movies, books,

1014
00:68:30.389 --> 00:68:34.838
et cetera. But is there, is it theoretically

1015
00:68:34.850 --> 00:68:41.878
possible according to physics for time traveling to exist or

1016
00:68:41.890 --> 00:68:45.289
occur? And if so, would it connect in

1017
00:68:45.298 --> 00:68:47.878
any way to the idea of the multiverse or not

1018
00:68:49.000 --> 00:68:50.899
? Well, when we talk about time travel,

1019
00:68:50.909 --> 00:68:55.720
we need to distinguish between time travel into the future

1020
00:68:56.229 --> 00:69:00.939
and time travel into the past. Well as Einstein

1021
00:69:00.149 --> 00:69:04.128
uh showed in his, in his special theory of

1022
00:69:04.140 --> 00:69:10.619
relativity, if you take an astronaut launch the astronaut

1023
00:69:10.628 --> 00:69:14.878
to space and that astronaut somehow can travel very,

1024
00:69:14.890 --> 00:69:16.239
very close to the speed of light. And that

1025
00:69:16.250 --> 00:69:21.020
astronaut returns to earth, that astronaut's clock would tick

1026
00:69:21.029 --> 00:69:27.458
more slowly than earth clocks. And that astronaut could

1027
00:69:27.789 --> 00:69:30.949
theoretically travel into the future of earth. Um So

1028
00:69:30.958 --> 00:69:35.140
, for example, uh if that astronaut was traveling

1029
00:69:35.149 --> 00:69:42.628
99.99% the speed of light, they might come back

1030
00:69:42.878 --> 00:69:46.100
and see that all of their relatives are either,

1031
00:69:46.159 --> 00:69:48.979
you know, 100 years old or, or likely

1032
00:69:48.989 --> 00:69:54.338
deceased. Um, you know, and uh Earth

1033
00:69:54.350 --> 00:69:57.259
is, you know, instead of being the 21st

1034
00:69:57.270 --> 00:70:00.029
century and the 22nd century, um because time is

1035
00:70:00.039 --> 00:70:03.128
relative. So that is a relatively simple way to

1036
00:70:03.140 --> 00:70:06.739
time travel. And that create doesn't create any contradictions

1037
00:70:06.750 --> 00:70:11.128
because you would just go into the future, you

1038
00:70:11.140 --> 00:70:15.159
would arrive in the future and you would maybe have

1039
00:70:15.168 --> 00:70:18.399
different customs and, you know, you would say

1040
00:70:18.409 --> 00:70:20.250
, where, where are the smartphones and say,

1041
00:70:20.259 --> 00:70:24.359
no, we use brain chips now or we use

1042
00:70:24.409 --> 00:70:27.119
something else. So you would say, ok,

1043
00:70:27.128 --> 00:70:30.079
technology has advanced. So that would be one way

1044
00:70:30.088 --> 00:70:31.890
of time travel. But what about traveling to the

1045
00:70:31.899 --> 00:70:36.140
past? We imagine going back in time and trying

1046
00:70:36.149 --> 00:70:41.159
to prevent the Second World War or something like that

1047
00:70:41.168 --> 00:70:43.250
, you know, you know, all these tr

1048
00:70:43.449 --> 00:70:48.720
tragedies. Um Well, physics does have the possibility

1049
00:70:48.729 --> 00:70:54.588
of that by creating something called a wormhole. Now

1050
00:70:54.600 --> 00:70:57.689
, a wormhole traversable wormhole is a little bit like

1051
00:70:57.699 --> 00:71:01.520
a black hole only it's stabilized. So instead of

1052
00:71:01.529 --> 00:71:09.189
having this um very narrow uh tunnel that possibly connects

1053
00:71:09.199 --> 00:71:13.640
to another region of space that would not be uh

1054
00:71:13.979 --> 00:71:16.270
you cannot travel into which will be deadly. Um

1055
00:71:16.279 --> 00:71:23.378
We imagine being able to stabilize this tunnel and make

1056
00:71:23.390 --> 00:71:25.779
it so that you can travel through it and end

1057
00:71:25.789 --> 00:71:30.100
up in a different part of space. Well as

1058
00:71:30.140 --> 00:71:32.949
uh Kip Thorne and some of his students showed,

1059
00:71:33.259 --> 00:71:38.229
uh there's a way that you can uh manipulate the

1060
00:71:38.239 --> 00:71:41.000
wormhole so that they can act as a time machine

1061
00:71:41.350 --> 00:71:45.399
and you could travel backward in time. And um

1062
00:71:45.699 --> 00:71:49.770
and then uh you wouldn't be able to travel before

1063
00:71:49.779 --> 00:71:51.819
the creation of the wormhole, but you could travel

1064
00:71:51.829 --> 00:71:55.770
back to at least the time when the wormhole was

1065
00:71:55.779 --> 00:71:59.159
created. And uh so if there are wormholes that

1066
00:71:59.168 --> 00:72:03.048
were created naturally in space that were useful as time

1067
00:72:03.060 --> 00:72:05.770
machines, you could use one of those. And

1068
00:72:05.779 --> 00:72:09.239
then the question is, could you affect history?

1069
00:72:09.619 --> 00:72:13.079
And the way it connects with the multiverse is in

1070
00:72:13.088 --> 00:72:16.000
science fiction, particularly, there's this idea that maybe

1071
00:72:16.009 --> 00:72:19.548
if you go backward in time and you try to

1072
00:72:19.560 --> 00:72:23.798
change history that maybe you start a new branch of

1073
00:72:23.810 --> 00:72:27.949
reality. So for example, let's say you go

1074
00:72:27.958 --> 00:72:31.119
back in time to the age of Hitler and you

1075
00:72:31.128 --> 00:72:36.069
assassinate Hitler and there's no Hitler, there's no Nazi

1076
00:72:36.079 --> 00:72:40.600
Germany and World War Two doesn't happen, but maybe

1077
00:72:40.609 --> 00:72:44.479
something else happens, maybe Stalin becomes all powerful and

1078
00:72:44.489 --> 00:72:47.689
takes over Europe. And then, um so now

1079
00:72:47.699 --> 00:72:50.539
we have, instead of, you know, Nazis

1080
00:72:50.770 --> 00:72:55.708
trying to take over Europe that's run by Stalin and

1081
00:72:55.720 --> 00:72:58.609
the Soviets. OK. So that's a different branch

1082
00:72:58.619 --> 00:73:01.298
of reality, maybe that would represent, you know

1083
00:73:01.310 --> 00:73:04.000
, a type of multiverse where you have all these

1084
00:73:04.009 --> 00:73:08.750
other alternative histories. But that is very science fiction

1085
00:73:08.759 --> 00:73:11.668
, a very speculative. It's not something that physics

1086
00:73:11.680 --> 00:73:15.899
can prove. So another thing that perhaps is also

1087
00:73:15.909 --> 00:73:21.918
speculative you, you tell me is the simulation hypothesis

1088
00:73:21.930 --> 00:73:26.878
. So what is it? And does it also

1089
00:73:27.069 --> 00:73:30.579
, does it have any relationship to the multiverse?

1090
00:73:31.708 --> 00:73:39.229
Well, um the simulation hypothesis is the idea that

1091
00:73:39.509 --> 00:73:42.789
could it be possible that everything we see, everything

1092
00:73:42.798 --> 00:73:47.628
we observe is a computer simulation that was designed by

1093
00:73:47.789 --> 00:73:54.189
some other intelligent being. And the argument for that

1094
00:73:54.199 --> 00:74:00.588
is imagine our civilization, um our own civilization evolves

1095
00:74:00.600 --> 00:74:04.500
naturally. And currently we have some forms of artificial

1096
00:74:04.509 --> 00:74:09.569
intelligence like we could create, you know, at

1097
00:74:09.579 --> 00:74:12.759
this point in time, you can create an essay

1098
00:74:12.770 --> 00:74:15.489
that looks like it was written by a human being

1099
00:74:15.500 --> 00:74:16.640
. It might have some mistakes, you know,

1100
00:74:16.649 --> 00:74:20.048
using chat G BT or some other mechanism. Well

1101
00:74:20.060 --> 00:74:26.878
, imagine um that you could uh create a simulated

1102
00:74:26.890 --> 00:74:29.439
human being, you know, something that would be

1103
00:74:29.449 --> 00:74:32.659
indistinguishable by from a human being. And then you

1104
00:74:32.668 --> 00:74:35.949
go on to create a simulated city where you have

1105
00:74:35.958 --> 00:74:42.208
human beings interact and it seems like human beings and

1106
00:74:42.220 --> 00:74:45.600
then you create a simulated planet and then maybe a

1107
00:74:45.609 --> 00:74:48.779
simulated, you know, solar system simulated galaxy.

1108
00:74:49.100 --> 00:74:57.298
Well, if intelligence intelligent beings uh last long enough

1109
00:74:57.930 --> 00:75:01.390
, the chances according to some thinkers that they could

1110
00:75:01.399 --> 00:75:08.810
create a simulation is 100% that eventually they would develop

1111
00:75:08.819 --> 00:75:12.869
the technology for this. So then imagine you have

1112
00:75:12.878 --> 00:75:17.338
all these uh natural worlds out there that create simulation

1113
00:75:17.350 --> 00:75:19.909
. So you would have all these simulated worlds out

1114
00:75:19.918 --> 00:75:26.470
there. Eventually, the simulated worlds would greatly outnumber

1115
00:75:26.479 --> 00:75:29.699
the natural worlds because you could have one natural world

1116
00:75:29.708 --> 00:75:32.539
creating all these simulated worlds. So then you estimate

1117
00:75:32.548 --> 00:75:35.819
the chances that we're in a simulated world or a

1118
00:75:35.829 --> 00:75:41.579
natural world and that becomes almost 100% according to these

1119
00:75:42.039 --> 00:75:44.168
thinkers that were in a simulated world, not a

1120
00:75:44.180 --> 00:75:47.009
natural world. So I don't quite buy that idea

1121
00:75:47.020 --> 00:75:51.100
personally. Um because, you know, there's,

1122
00:75:51.279 --> 00:75:57.100
there's all these other arguments about design that were designed

1123
00:75:57.500 --> 00:76:01.958
and uh the simplest one that, you know,

1124
00:76:02.060 --> 00:76:06.720
people who are religious believe or may some people religious

1125
00:76:06.729 --> 00:76:10.609
believe? Well, we were designed by a divine

1126
00:76:10.619 --> 00:76:13.989
being. Ok. Well, some people don't believe

1127
00:76:14.000 --> 00:76:15.970
that some people do believe that, but it's a

1128
00:76:15.979 --> 00:76:19.668
simpler belief to say that there's a divine being out

1129
00:76:19.680 --> 00:76:23.270
there than to say, oh, well, there's

1130
00:76:23.279 --> 00:76:27.838
another, you know, set of beings that created

1131
00:76:27.850 --> 00:76:30.329
us well, who created them, you know,

1132
00:76:30.338 --> 00:76:31.750
were they as simulation? And it gets into this

1133
00:76:31.759 --> 00:76:38.189
whole uh philosophical uh tangled argument about, you know

1134
00:76:38.199 --> 00:76:40.539
, why are there real beings? Why are they

1135
00:76:40.548 --> 00:76:45.609
simulated beings? And what's the connection? And if

1136
00:76:45.619 --> 00:76:48.600
we actually were living in a simulation, would there

1137
00:76:48.609 --> 00:76:54.548
be any way at all of verifying that of empirically

1138
00:76:54.970 --> 00:76:58.949
? I mean, being sure of that. Well

1139
00:76:58.958 --> 00:77:00.359
, I can only turn to science fiction and say

1140
00:77:00.369 --> 00:77:03.239
, well, maybe someone would hand us a red

1141
00:77:03.250 --> 00:77:05.100
pill and you take it and all of a sudden

1142
00:77:05.109 --> 00:77:08.838
you see, you see everything like in the matrix

1143
00:77:09.220 --> 00:77:14.079
. Um because um you know, if it was

1144
00:77:14.449 --> 00:77:17.949
, it was a really smart intelligent being, they

1145
00:77:17.958 --> 00:77:24.128
would create a perfect simulation. So um but uh

1146
00:77:24.149 --> 00:77:28.699
you could speculate about intelligent being that's very, very

1147
00:77:28.708 --> 00:77:31.560
, very smart but makes mistakes and creates a flawed

1148
00:77:31.569 --> 00:77:35.079
simulation. So all of a sudden you wake up

1149
00:77:35.548 --> 00:77:39.069
and you look up at the sky and instead of

1150
00:77:39.079 --> 00:77:42.489
seeing, seeing the moon or whatever, you know

1151
00:77:42.500 --> 00:77:44.149
, wake up at night and instead of seeing the

1152
00:77:44.159 --> 00:77:46.069
moon, you see something that looks like pixels and

1153
00:77:46.079 --> 00:77:47.939
you're like, wait a minute, what are those

1154
00:77:47.949 --> 00:77:51.529
pixels doing there? But you know, if,

1155
00:77:51.539 --> 00:77:56.409
if an intelligent race was smart enough to develop a

1156
00:77:56.418 --> 00:77:59.298
simulation, it would, it would conceivably be a

1157
00:77:59.310 --> 00:78:00.399
perfect simulation, then you wouldn't be able to tell

1158
00:78:00.409 --> 00:78:04.470
the difference. So this becomes almost like, you

1159
00:78:04.479 --> 00:78:08.079
know, in a way, I think it gets

1160
00:78:08.088 --> 00:78:12.689
a little silly uh a little comical like, OK

1161
00:78:13.109 --> 00:78:15.359
, you know, if it's a perfect simulation,

1162
00:78:15.378 --> 00:78:18.770
could there be flaws? OK, that's gets a

1163
00:78:18.779 --> 00:78:20.890
little bit silly to think about things like that.

1164
00:78:23.088 --> 00:78:27.128
So we've been touching on science fiction here and there

1165
00:78:27.140 --> 00:78:30.668
during our conversation. But what are probably some of

1166
00:78:30.680 --> 00:78:35.390
the most common ways that in popular culture, people

1167
00:78:35.399 --> 00:78:41.350
portray the multiverse and as a physicist, I mean

1168
00:78:41.359 --> 00:78:44.779
, is it that you just take it lightly?

1169
00:78:44.789 --> 00:78:46.430
I mean, it's just fiction, whatever or,

1170
00:78:46.548 --> 00:78:49.069
uh is it that some of those ways that the

1171
00:78:49.079 --> 00:78:55.949
multiverse is portrayed actually bother you? Well, I

1172
00:78:55.958 --> 00:78:59.199
think of it from the point of view of somebody

1173
00:78:59.208 --> 00:79:01.449
who's a researcher and they apply to the government for

1174
00:79:01.458 --> 00:79:03.958
a grant or they applied to a corporation for a

1175
00:79:03.970 --> 00:79:08.979
grant. So let's say they have this idea for

1176
00:79:08.989 --> 00:79:12.979
testing, you know, using observations of the cosmic

1177
00:79:13.109 --> 00:79:16.770
micro background to test for other universes and the word

1178
00:79:16.779 --> 00:79:21.000
multiverse comes up and they send it to, um

1179
00:79:21.009 --> 00:79:27.029
, somebody to review their grants and that person has

1180
00:79:27.039 --> 00:79:30.060
just seen a marvel movie they see, just saw

1181
00:79:30.069 --> 00:79:32.560
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and they come

1182
00:79:32.569 --> 00:79:35.029
back and say this is not real science. This

1183
00:79:35.039 --> 00:79:38.699
is science fiction. You don't get any money from

1184
00:79:38.708 --> 00:79:43.609
me or it's another possibility. You could have someone

1185
00:79:43.619 --> 00:79:45.369
who says, wow, I love that movie.

1186
00:79:45.458 --> 00:79:48.229
I love science fiction. You know, that's really

1187
00:79:48.239 --> 00:79:51.119
cool that you can test these things in real life

1188
00:79:51.128 --> 00:79:56.208
. You get, you know, here's$100,000 you

1189
00:79:56.220 --> 00:80:00.689
know, for your grant,€100,000. So then

1190
00:80:00.699 --> 00:80:02.350
, um then you could be lucky. So it's

1191
00:80:02.359 --> 00:80:04.418
, it's a little bit of a mixed thing.

1192
00:80:04.560 --> 00:80:09.289
Some scientists are like, well, science fiction talks

1193
00:80:09.298 --> 00:80:13.859
about multiverse ideas, those are really not real science

1194
00:80:14.060 --> 00:80:15.949
. So let's not even talk about a multiverse and

1195
00:80:15.958 --> 00:80:21.659
others uh appreciate the popular interest as a way of

1196
00:80:21.708 --> 00:80:25.699
supporting science. Like, OK, you've learned,

1197
00:80:25.708 --> 00:80:28.079
you've seen the Multiverse in movies, let me show

1198
00:80:28.088 --> 00:80:30.759
you the real multiverse ideas. Forget about the movies

1199
00:80:30.770 --> 00:80:33.619
. Here's the real science of it. So in

1200
00:80:33.628 --> 00:80:39.229
the movies, the main attraction is the idea of

1201
00:80:39.239 --> 00:80:43.229
, of what if you know, what if you

1202
00:80:43.239 --> 00:80:47.189
know Spiderman came from a different background? What if

1203
00:80:47.509 --> 00:80:53.869
you know in Star Trek instead of Spock being logical

1204
00:80:54.208 --> 00:80:58.729
and emotionless? What if Spock were evil and very

1205
00:80:58.739 --> 00:81:00.458
emotional? So we see, you know, an

1206
00:81:00.470 --> 00:81:05.220
alternate universe where Spock as a beard and is sinister

1207
00:81:05.229 --> 00:81:09.560
and so forth. So these are all talked about

1208
00:81:09.569 --> 00:81:11.798
in, um, you know, in science fiction

1209
00:81:11.989 --> 00:81:14.600
. And then there's even the simple question, what

1210
00:81:14.609 --> 00:81:16.930
if I missed a train instead of making a train

1211
00:81:16.939 --> 00:81:20.520
? And that's the movie sliding doors where a woman

1212
00:81:20.770 --> 00:81:26.213
just misses a subway train versus just makes a subway

1213
00:81:26.225 --> 00:81:30.253
train? And the movie shows what happens to her

1214
00:81:30.265 --> 00:81:32.354
life in the, the world where she just makes

1215
00:81:32.364 --> 00:81:35.574
the train and now their possibility where she just misses

1216
00:81:35.583 --> 00:81:38.694
the train. And in one of them, she

1217
00:81:38.704 --> 00:81:43.164
discovers that her boyfriend is having an affair with another

1218
00:81:43.173 --> 00:81:45.854
woman and she breaks up with the boyfriend, she

1219
00:81:45.864 --> 00:81:50.173
finds another boyfriend who's much nicer and her life continues

1220
00:81:50.649 --> 00:81:55.350
and then in the other scenario, she doesn't discover

1221
00:81:55.390 --> 00:81:58.458
that her boyfriend is cheating on her, she continues

1222
00:81:58.470 --> 00:82:00.770
with the same boyfriend and then we see what happens

1223
00:82:00.779 --> 00:82:02.378
at the end and I'm not gonna give too much

1224
00:82:02.390 --> 00:82:08.829
away, but the branch of reality, which looks

1225
00:82:08.838 --> 00:82:11.779
like a good one might not be so good after

1226
00:82:11.789 --> 00:82:14.899
all in the movie. So, these are intriguing

1227
00:82:14.909 --> 00:82:17.489
ways to think about the multiverse in science fiction.

1228
00:82:18.329 --> 00:82:20.418
Uh, I mean, it's as if, uh

1229
00:82:20.430 --> 00:82:24.909
, every time in movies, every time people think

1230
00:82:24.918 --> 00:82:30.029
about different possibilities, they're dealing with counterfactual in their

1231
00:82:30.039 --> 00:82:31.529
mind. What if this happened? What if that

1232
00:82:31.539 --> 00:82:36.739
happened? Reality branched and then a new universe popped

1233
00:82:36.750 --> 00:82:42.628
up where the, what if really happened? Right

1234
00:82:42.640 --> 00:82:45.149
. Yes, that's right. So we, we

1235
00:82:45.159 --> 00:82:47.890
often imagine, uh, what happened, what would

1236
00:82:47.899 --> 00:82:50.548
happen if we made different decisions in our lives?

1237
00:82:50.720 --> 00:82:54.918
Like what if we decided to move to a different

1238
00:82:54.930 --> 00:82:57.869
city? So, um, you know, what

1239
00:82:57.878 --> 00:83:00.819
if we decided a different job? So, so

1240
00:83:00.829 --> 00:83:03.588
imagine we grew up and as a teenager, we

1241
00:83:03.600 --> 00:83:06.458
were in a rock band and, you know,

1242
00:83:06.470 --> 00:83:10.739
we played it at our high school and everybody applauded

1243
00:83:11.168 --> 00:83:13.529
and then our parents say, wait a minute,

1244
00:83:13.539 --> 00:83:16.128
you can't make any money from a rock rock music

1245
00:83:16.250 --> 00:83:18.548
. You should go into a serious job and we

1246
00:83:18.560 --> 00:83:23.079
become an accountant instead. But then, um,

1247
00:83:23.140 --> 00:83:26.810
we imagine what would be a scenario where we say

1248
00:83:26.819 --> 00:83:28.750
to our parents. No, no, no.

1249
00:83:28.759 --> 00:83:32.149
We wanted to stay in music and then we become

1250
00:83:32.220 --> 00:83:35.220
The Beatles or The Rolling Stones or, you know

1251
00:83:35.229 --> 00:83:38.720
, they're very successful rock band. We say,

1252
00:83:38.729 --> 00:83:41.409
ah, it's very good that we didn't listen to

1253
00:83:41.418 --> 00:83:44.168
our parents. And we, we pursued our musical

1254
00:83:44.180 --> 00:83:46.350
dream because we became one of the most successful bands

1255
00:83:46.359 --> 00:83:49.819
of all time. So we don't know until,

1256
00:83:49.829 --> 00:83:53.500
unless there were, uh, you know, the

1257
00:83:53.509 --> 00:83:57.689
possibility of viewing other universes, other branches of reality

1258
00:83:57.699 --> 00:84:00.640
, we wouldn't know if our decisions were good decisions

1259
00:84:00.649 --> 00:84:04.168
or bad decisions. So one last question and then

1260
00:84:04.180 --> 00:84:09.569
sort of related to this previous one. Do you

1261
00:84:09.579 --> 00:84:11.418
see, I, I mean, how do you

1262
00:84:11.430 --> 00:84:15.029
look at the popular ideas that people have about the

1263
00:84:15.039 --> 00:84:18.449
universe? Do you think that they attribute specific meanings

1264
00:84:18.458 --> 00:84:23.289
to the universe to the multiverse that the it might

1265
00:84:23.298 --> 00:84:27.659
be meaningful in some way for people to consider the

1266
00:84:27.668 --> 00:84:32.168
possibility of a multiverse existing? Well, I think

1267
00:84:32.180 --> 00:84:35.319
it's, it's fun to imagine about different things.

1268
00:84:35.659 --> 00:84:41.659
And I like science fiction personally and I like dreaming

1269
00:84:41.668 --> 00:84:45.338
about other worlds and thinking about different scenarios and I

1270
00:84:45.350 --> 00:84:47.619
think that's, that's perfectly healthy. Uh The only

1271
00:84:47.628 --> 00:84:50.890
time I have a bit of an objection is when

1272
00:84:51.088 --> 00:84:55.720
people exploit quantum physics or exploit the idea of a

1273
00:84:55.729 --> 00:85:01.350
multiverse and try to convince people that um they can

1274
00:85:01.359 --> 00:85:06.259
control their own reality by using quantum physics. So

1275
00:85:06.270 --> 00:85:10.079
they say they'll say something like, like all you

1276
00:85:10.088 --> 00:85:15.829
have to do is want to be rich and you

1277
00:85:15.838 --> 00:85:18.949
know, um you know, buy my book or

1278
00:85:18.958 --> 00:85:21.270
listen to my audio. I'll show you how,

1279
00:85:21.279 --> 00:85:26.619
so it's only$100 for this audio. And you'll

1280
00:85:26.628 --> 00:85:30.029
learn how that using quantum physics, you'll uh use

1281
00:85:30.039 --> 00:85:33.329
your mind and make the right choice and that will

1282
00:85:33.604 --> 00:85:38.515
you into a universe where you're very wealthy using,

1283
00:85:38.713 --> 00:85:41.114
you know, the idea of a multiverse. Well

1284
00:85:41.125 --> 00:85:45.354
, somebody is making money from a false premise there

1285
00:85:45.604 --> 00:85:48.685
but it's very easy to try to exploit physics and

1286
00:85:48.694 --> 00:85:53.384
to try to convince people uh that they can use

1287
00:85:53.395 --> 00:85:55.694
it to become rich or become, you know,

1288
00:85:55.704 --> 00:85:59.345
immortal, become, you know, super healthy and

1289
00:85:59.354 --> 00:86:01.029
so forth. So I would steer personally, I

1290
00:86:01.039 --> 00:86:05.329
would steer away from those ideas because it's, it's

1291
00:86:05.338 --> 00:86:10.600
not really a proper use of a physics to say

1292
00:86:10.699 --> 00:86:12.810
if you think you're rich, you're gonna be rich

1293
00:86:13.850 --> 00:86:16.819
. It's like that very popular book from a few

1294
00:86:16.829 --> 00:86:19.588
years ago. The Secret, right? And other

1295
00:86:19.600 --> 00:86:26.628
similar ideas popularized by some self help gurus, right

1296
00:86:27.020 --> 00:86:29.878
? Yes. Although there are people who, who

1297
00:86:29.890 --> 00:86:31.979
find quantum books in the self help section of a

1298
00:86:31.989 --> 00:86:38.539
bookstore and then become seriously interested in real scientific ideas

1299
00:86:38.890 --> 00:86:42.939
. Like for example, um uh I, I

1300
00:86:42.949 --> 00:86:49.579
know a rock musician who in the 19 nineties looked

1301
00:86:49.588 --> 00:86:51.958
at a lot of self help books and that led

1302
00:86:51.970 --> 00:86:56.109
him to write songs about quantum physics. So it

1303
00:86:56.119 --> 00:87:00.119
can be a good thing. Well, let's send

1304
00:87:00.128 --> 00:87:01.829
on that note then and the book is again the

1305
00:87:01.838 --> 00:87:06.060
lure of the multiverse extra dimensions, other worlds and

1306
00:87:06.069 --> 00:87:09.750
parallel universes. I'm leaving a link to it in

1307
00:87:09.759 --> 00:87:13.668
the description of the interview. And uh Paul just

1308
00:87:13.680 --> 00:87:15.039
before we go apart from the book, would you

1309
00:87:15.048 --> 00:87:17.509
like, would you like to let people know where

1310
00:87:17.520 --> 00:87:20.029
they can find you when your work on the internet

1311
00:87:21.088 --> 00:87:24.140
? Well, I'm active on what used to be

1312
00:87:24.149 --> 00:87:26.979
known as Twitter, also known as X. I'm

1313
00:87:26.989 --> 00:87:30.338
also on uh Blue Sky Mastodon. I have my

1314
00:87:30.350 --> 00:87:35.509
own uh blog. Uh Yeah, it's active sometimes

1315
00:87:35.759 --> 00:87:40.088
I post things and I post articles. Uh So

1316
00:87:40.100 --> 00:87:42.789
if you Google my name, uh some of these

1317
00:87:42.798 --> 00:87:45.220
things should come up, you know, social media

1318
00:87:45.458 --> 00:87:47.708
, there's a Facebook writing page for me, but

1319
00:87:47.720 --> 00:87:50.859
I'm not uh involved in that, but there are

1320
00:87:50.869 --> 00:87:54.569
a lot of social media that you can reach out

1321
00:87:54.579 --> 00:87:59.759
to me and especially on um X Twitter. I'm

1322
00:87:59.770 --> 00:88:01.208
, I'm very active on that under the hand of

1323
00:88:01.220 --> 00:88:05.369
P Halpern. Great. So I'm also leaving that

1324
00:88:05.378 --> 00:88:08.930
in the description of the interview and thank you so

1325
00:88:08.939 --> 00:88:11.250
