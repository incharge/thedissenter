00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.719
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.739
And today I'm joined by doctors Darcia Narvaez and Gay

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.630
Bradshaw. Doctor Darcia Narvaez is a Professor of Psychology

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.000
Merit at the University of Notre Dame. And Doctor

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.958
G Bradshaw is a psychologist and Ecologist and director of

7
00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.120
the Kulu Center for Nonviolence. And today we're focusing

8
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:29.429
on their book. They Evolved Nest Nature's Way of

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.709
raising Children and creating connected communities. So, welcome

10
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.399
to the show. It's a pleasure to have you

11
00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:41.658
both on. Great to be here. So I

12
00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:45.279
would like to start by asking what is exactly the

13
00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.118
premise of the book and what is an evolved next

14
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.728
? Well, every animal has a nest for uh

15
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.709
raising its young. It's a developmental system that has

16
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.868
uh been shaped through evolution to optimize normal development.

17
00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.588
And so these are uh just part of our adaptation

18
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:15.019
as animals a and are these uh species specific or

19
00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:19.620
are they or are there some commonalities across species?

20
00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:25.859
There are commonalities and differences too? So it's uh

21
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.599
that's what's fun about the book is that we note

22
00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.109
the similarities and then we point out, oh,

23
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.650
look at how they do it, that this animal

24
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.069
species does it this way and, and that kind

25
00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.138
of thing. So, uh it's just a um

26
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.109
a way of raising the young that is about nurturance

27
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.069
and meeting the needs of the young, the basic

28
00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.939
needs without delay, without, you know, depending

29
00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:52.698
on the species, what that means and to foster

30
00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.588
a sense of connectedness of safety, of security and

31
00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.668
of uh physiological, mental, psychological well being.

32
00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.019
Yeah, I think what the book does is really

33
00:02:04.028 --> 00:02:07.980
uh cements what has been known in uh Western science

34
00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.520
for hundreds of years actually. But in particular,

35
00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:14.929
the last decades when neuroscience has come to the fore

36
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.258
and that's that all animals and now there's going to

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.639
be including the data and theory and experimentation on plants

38
00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.629
, trees, et cetera that we all share the

39
00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.014
same um capacities and structures of the brain or of

40
00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:34.514
the system that gives us the capacity to think,

41
00:02:34.524 --> 00:02:36.903
feel love and dream and all of those things.

42
00:02:36.913 --> 00:02:38.585
So that's really been known, but it's been quite

43
00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:43.625
tacit and this particular book and, and our collaboration

44
00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:47.429
really has shown that there's a uh that we're all

45
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.849
the same. It, it's rather than differences.

46
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.960
The emphasis is on diversity. So when you're saying

47
00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:54.819
, is there species specific? Yes, there is

48
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.679
just like there are among human cultures. And I

49
00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.360
think that that's probably the the the best way to

50
00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:05.838
uh uh readers and listeners to approach. This is

51
00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.360
saying oh, you know, we're all the same

52
00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:13.449
and yet we interact and we express our interactions and

53
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.618
experiences where we live in our, our history in

54
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.538
different ways, just as we look at different human

55
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.038
cultures. So there are very different aspects of child

56
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.538
rearing and our uh individuals from the same family or

57
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.588
community, establish relationships among themselves that you explore in

58
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.750
the book. We don't have time here, of

59
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.694
course, to get into all of them. But

60
00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:40.794
let's get perhaps into a few examples. So could

61
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:46.314
you tell us perhaps how mothers and all mothers uh

62
00:03:46.324 --> 00:03:50.493
the role they play basically in, for example,

63
00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:54.639
African elephant societies? Well, I'll start in Darsha

64
00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.058
, you can, you can fill in with things

65
00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.758
. Um African elephants are a prime example. They've

66
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.028
been extremely well studied by science and um a lot

67
00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:05.649
of people have a lot of humans have a lot

68
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.838
of affinity for them. Um Just to clarify alo

69
00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.395
mother, uh mother usually refers to the, the

70
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:15.605
individual, what we would call the biological or the

71
00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:20.184
primary um caregiver that is female that would nurse,

72
00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:24.244
et cetera and give birth to an individual. Um

73
00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:28.713
Ala mothers are um other mothers and that is really

74
00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:33.303
the uh the norm among most human societies, traditionally

75
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:38.928
, as well as uh animal um societies. So

76
00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.278
in the African elephants is that a baby is born

77
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.709
from to a particular female elephant. And prior to

78
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.720
the birth um that mother and the baby who's in

79
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.079
the mother is immersed in this constellation of aloe mothers

80
00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:58.600
, other mothers, there are siblings, there's,

81
00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:01.399
you know, teenagers, there's cousins and babies and

82
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.119
they're really this sort of organism that moves around and

83
00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.798
, and uh is there to support the mother prior

84
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:12.879
to the birthing which takes two years in, in

85
00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.660
African elephants at gestation. And, and afterwards,

86
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.838
so immediately when the baby is uh comes into the

87
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.428
world from the mother's womb, uh he or she

88
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:29.678
is literally surrounded by other elephants and family members and

89
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.588
supporters. So you have seamless connection um of being

90
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.798
in this community. And, and I think as

91
00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.730
we go on it really in the sense of looking

92
00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:42.548
at the evolved nest and child rearing and childbirthing,

93
00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.439
et cetera. The implicit, which really should be

94
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.988
made more explicit is the um the need and the

95
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.250
role of a community. So it's not just the

96
00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.238
mother, it's not just the father, it's really

97
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.480
a community effort of which the focal element of course

98
00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:00.088
, is the birthing, the birthing mother or birthing

99
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.470
parent and, and the child. And of course

100
00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.750
, 00 yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Yeah

101
00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.069
, it's interesting that our species uh we are apes

102
00:06:13.778 --> 00:06:16.980
. Uh We come from uh shared lineages with monkeys

103
00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:20.920
earlier and monkeys tend to share and have fowl mothering

104
00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:25.100
going on uh other nurturers and they share their babies

105
00:06:25.108 --> 00:06:29.399
around, but all the other apes except us uh

106
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.600
keep uh it's just a mother that keeps her child

107
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:35.778
because she doesn't trust the others. Uh And that

108
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.619
they evolved then to just have mothers taking care of

109
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.040
their young. But humans, we brought back the

110
00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:48.389
aloe mothering in it according to the evolutionary um ethology

111
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.699
uh data. And that's really important for us because

112
00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.959
it actually shapes the brain to be much more flexible

113
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:59.220
in social relations. Because if you're only with one

114
00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:00.858
mother, at least for humans, you tend to

115
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.548
be much more rigid about how to get along with

116
00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:05.939
others because you only have practice with one really,

117
00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.619
you know, in the first years. So you

118
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.129
want to have a set of, of nurturers,

119
00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.509
people who are spons. Uh It's good for the

120
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.970
baby, but it's also good for a mother because

121
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.259
babies, the evolved nest is, you know,

122
00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:23.250
rather demanding for, in terms of baby care.

123
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.108
Uh We are like fetuses when we're born, fetuses

124
00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:28.559
of other animals for at least the 18 months,

125
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:30.449
uh the 1st 18 months of uh of age.

126
00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.519
And so babies need to feel like they're still in

127
00:07:33.528 --> 00:07:36.000
the womb. Uh And that requires a lot of

128
00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.579
holding and moms just can't do it all. It's

129
00:07:39.588 --> 00:07:44.209
like what? So that's why our species perhaps went

130
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.559
back to this collective uh child raising. And uh

131
00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:50.358
the anthropologists tell us that it actually shaped our big

132
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:54.759
social brain to have cooperated child raising so that we

133
00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:58.769
could have uh others providing the many calories we need

134
00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.528
to be to build a big brain. So you

135
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:07.488
mentioned holding the baby there, what is the importance

136
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.139
of physical contact for the baby? And also by

137
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:13.899
the way for the mother or the other people who

138
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.809
take care of it. Well, in uh the

139
00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:22.949
neuroscience is telling us that the touch is central to

140
00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:28.230
helping establish uh well functioning uh biological systems like the

141
00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:31.808
vagus nerve, uh the 10th cranial nerve that innervates

142
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.308
all the major systems of the body. And it's

143
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.548
being uh it's also fostered by breastfeeding. Uh And

144
00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:43.129
um but touch is really important for that. And

145
00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.969
if you don't get the vagus nerve well established,

146
00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:48.129
you might have then health problems of various kinds later

147
00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:50.820
, you know, digestive issues, uh heart uh

148
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:54.009
lung issues, brain seizures, that kind of thing

149
00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:58.129
. When the vagus nerve is malfunctioning, it's also

150
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:01.178
the uh Oxytocin system. You want the endocrine system

151
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.349
systems to be established properly and touch really has a

152
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:05.570
lot to do with that. You wanna have that

153
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.080
cuddle hormone that carries you forward. So you,

154
00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:11.479
you know, you actually like to be with people

155
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:13.000
and like to touch them and feel comforted by that

156
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:18.519
. So there's many different neurobiological aspects that are are

157
00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:20.969
um affected by touch. It's calming it. Uh

158
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.009
of course, is gonna have epigenetic effects, turning

159
00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:28.048
genes on and off that are gonna be oriented to

160
00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:31.009
good health and touch needs to be positive touch,

161
00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.070
not negative touch. We've got a lot of data

162
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.519
now on how even spanking uh a, a child

163
00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:39.808
is like uh physical abuse or emotional abuse in its

164
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.489
long term effects, making the individual more aggressive,

165
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.719
less empathic and sensitive to others. I think even

166
00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:52.609
at, at a deeper level, when we look

167
00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:54.279
at um touch and we look at the aloe mothering

168
00:09:54.288 --> 00:09:58.678
or the alo parenting, um it really underscores that

169
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.570
we're not these isolated units that essentially, yes,

170
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.200
there is an individual that comes into the world,

171
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.389
but that's like a piece of a bigger puzzle or

172
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:11.649
a piece of the tapestry. And so what we

173
00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:13.168
see on the outside, you know what Darsha was

174
00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:16.269
explaining and then looking from the neural sciences perspective,

175
00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.619
what's happening on the inside from a science perspective is

176
00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:24.859
really a reflection of the reality of oneness and connection

177
00:10:24.869 --> 00:10:26.500
, even if it is in the case of the

178
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:28.029
brown bear. That's a chapter in our book.

179
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.500
Um There isn't an Aloe family per se, it's

180
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:35.349
a mother bear uh who births the babies. And

181
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:37.840
uh it's the hibernation den, which is really the

182
00:10:37.849 --> 00:10:43.379
sort of the equivalent of the Aloe mothering elephants,

183
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:45.779
et cetera. But it's really the environment. And

184
00:10:45.788 --> 00:10:48.058
so in, in another way too, it erases

185
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.759
the difference between social and ecological, those are just

186
00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:54.009
sort of different elements of the same theme. So

187
00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:58.298
there is this uh continuity, there is this coherence

188
00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:01.950
and, and we see that as expressed in terms

189
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.440
of what Darsh is describing as, as touch and

190
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.739
positive touch in that way. So, you know

191
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.269
, it, it goes beyond the material. And

192
00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.889
the neuroscience is, is just one way of sort

193
00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:16.908
of keeping track of what those little pieces are from

194
00:11:16.918 --> 00:11:20.759
the perspective of what science in our culture, modern

195
00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:22.750
culture has relied on, which is dualism. But

196
00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:26.139
really, we're looking at non dual consciousness, we're

197
00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:31.849
really looking at this um coherence of oneness. So

198
00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:37.349
we've mentioned mothers and mothers here. What about grandmothers

199
00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:41.139
and the other older people in the community? What

200
00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:46.070
is basically the role played by elders in human and

201
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.969
nonhuman societies? Well, they are part of the

202
00:11:50.979 --> 00:11:54.649
Aloe parents allo mothers, other nurturers, right?

203
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.750
And uh there is a grandmother hypothesis that the reason

204
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:05.649
that women, human, human um women uh exist

205
00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.798
to live beyond menopause is so that they can take

206
00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:11.690
care of the young because again, the young are

207
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.928
young, need a lot of calories. And,

208
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.450
and there's data showing that when you have the grandmother

209
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.460
around the mother's mother, Children do better, they

210
00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:22.830
have uh more, you know, better health and

211
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.899
so on. So that's uh kind of more of

212
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.259
a anthropological view. The uh indigenous perspective of course

213
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:33.629
, is that elders hold the wisdom of the community

214
00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:37.710
and they uh they are repositories and they have all

215
00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:43.830
the stories and experiences that help the community uh survive

216
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.038
and thrive wherever they are. So it's very landscape

217
00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:50.058
specific. The language is from the landscape and uh

218
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.788
they are essential for the well being of the community

219
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.460
and their care of the very young Children is just

220
00:12:56.469 --> 00:13:01.440
ideal because they both are sort of still in tune

221
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.340
or attuned to the UN manifest realm, the spiritual

222
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:07.918
realm and, and they're not so focused on,

223
00:13:07.928 --> 00:13:11.149
you know, working and like, uh adults are

224
00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.950
so they really get along well and, and the

225
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.590
grandparents are much more forgiving and less rigid and so

226
00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:18.889
on with the very young so that actually knits together

227
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:22.570
the community. And when the native Americans uh in

228
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.450
Canada and the US uh were um considered savage and

229
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.190
the governments wanted to break down, make them,

230
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.129
you know, kill the Indian and save the soul

231
00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:37.639
. They broke up those relationships, taking the Children

232
00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:41.928
away and it really devastated the communities because the elders

233
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.009
didn't have the young as an anchor for themselves and

234
00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:48.830
the young didn't have that community to foster their culture

235
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.599
and language and so on. So the intergenerational violence

236
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:58.129
uh continues uh from those horrible genocidal uh treatments.

237
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:03.619
Uh And of course, when we talk about child

238
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:07.668
rearing, we tend to focus a lot on the

239
00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:11.729
mother and sometimes also other females. But what about

240
00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:15.590
the father? Could you tell us perhaps about the

241
00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:20.879
example of Emperor Penguins and the role that fathers play

242
00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:26.168
there. We love Emperor Penguins. Of course,

243
00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:30.019
I'll start off. Um Yeah, I think a

244
00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:31.590
lot of people, they've been popularized in movies I've

245
00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:33.678
heard and things like that. But the Emperor Penguins

246
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.840
live in the Antarctic and they're around 4 ft high

247
00:14:37.158 --> 00:14:39.288
. And just a kind of a cartoon sketch of

248
00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:43.288
, of the community is that the mother, the

249
00:14:43.298 --> 00:14:46.048
mother and the father meet and they form partnerships and

250
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:50.969
make love. And then the mother produces this amazing

251
00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:54.960
single egg and it's very, very cold there.

252
00:14:54.969 --> 00:14:56.599
The conditions are very, very harsh. And so

253
00:14:56.609 --> 00:15:01.080
she eventually lays the egg and is essentially when she

254
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.798
does that, it's almost immediately passed to the father

255
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.190
who is um now receives the egg and immediately puts

256
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.019
it under his feathers in this pouch. And the

257
00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:16.178
purpose of that is because the the extreme cold there

258
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.940
, the wind chill factors makes it even greater and

259
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.178
he takes care of the egg while the egg is

260
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.139
becoming a baby and the mothers um they live in

261
00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:28.779
a colony, I mean, there's all these individual

262
00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:31.879
pairs and different relationships but they are within a,

263
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.219
a community. Uh It's a colony and the mothers

264
00:15:35.229 --> 00:15:39.000
essentially all leave at that time, they birth roughly

265
00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:41.849
probably at the same time and they go up to

266
00:15:41.859 --> 00:15:45.489
a couple kom a couple 100 kilometers away off the

267
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.330
ice and into the ocean. And that is to

268
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.149
replenish because all of their energies has been diverted and

269
00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:56.779
, and directed toward creating the egg and all the

270
00:15:56.788 --> 00:16:00.029
nutrients and psychological, emotional everything has. So this

271
00:16:00.038 --> 00:16:03.019
is going off to replenish and they spend a couple

272
00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:06.019
of months there diving and looking for fish and,

273
00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:08.239
and uh resting up and replenishing in the meanwhile,

274
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.129
the fathers are gathering, they each have an egg

275
00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:15.298
. Uh and again, it's very protected and they

276
00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.639
gather in what's called a huddle, which are a

277
00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:22.369
group of, of uh fathers. And they do

278
00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:25.239
that. Um you know, well, from a

279
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.210
physical perspective is that because it retains warmth, it

280
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:33.428
becomes this kind of thermal unit by which the temperatures

281
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.580
of the egg can be kept perfect, not too

282
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.479
hot, not too cold. And in order to

283
00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:41.619
do that, they actually move, you know,

284
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:45.678
in, in a very choreographed way to the interior

285
00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:48.509
of the huddle and then some go to the outside

286
00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:51.158
. So again, this is this co ordination.

287
00:16:51.168 --> 00:16:52.629
Again, this is a community so that there's a

288
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:56.739
baby, but it's a community and then the baby

289
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.149
is born and at that time, the mother returns

290
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.178
and essentially, then the fathers go off and they

291
00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:06.140
are also depleted. Um Some have lost half their

292
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.410
weight, they go to the ocean and replete and

293
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.920
then they come back and it's a very emotional and

294
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.660
very intense time because typically the colonies are in the

295
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.170
thousands and they have to find their mother and their

296
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.709
wife and child. So, um doctor Andre who's

297
00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.430
in France is a researcher talks very beautifully about this

298
00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:27.150
that um they're very mindful. So again, we're

299
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.750
talking about a community and this is an important point

300
00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.039
because they're all coordinating together. There isn't this notion

301
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:37.250
of competition there isn't this notion of me first or

302
00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.910
anything like that. Um They give particular calls,

303
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.000
they each have their own idiolect call. And if

304
00:17:44.009 --> 00:17:45.809
, if the guy next to you is calling for

305
00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:48.039
his, they wait for, until that person can

306
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:52.000
call and identify. So eventually they're all uh brought

307
00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:55.259
back together and they uh form a, a family

308
00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:56.439
and it's very much, um the term is co

309
00:17:56.529 --> 00:18:00.189
parenting. So, so there's a very much coordinate

310
00:18:00.199 --> 00:18:03.078
at many scales between the mother and the father,

311
00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:07.049
including the egg and then the mothers with the mothers

312
00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:11.269
and the fathers with the fathers. And then again

313
00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:14.400
, as the baby matures, then there is a

314
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.809
crash uh uh uh uh you know, a kind

315
00:18:15.818 --> 00:18:19.588
of a coalescing of all the young chicks, um

316
00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:22.608
you know, kind of like a kindergarten or whatever

317
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:25.078
, but they're all together, there really isn't any

318
00:18:25.088 --> 00:18:26.769
kind of separation. And the other idea is that

319
00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:32.348
connection is with community nonparent and, and with each

320
00:18:32.358 --> 00:18:34.549
other in that way. So it, again,

321
00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:37.709
this is just an example and we have examples uh

322
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:41.088
in the chapter on gray wolves, which is different

323
00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:44.949
, but it, there does show the participation of

324
00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:47.559
the, of the um of, of males and

325
00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:48.180
same with the elephants. So I'll just put that

326
00:18:48.189 --> 00:18:52.390
in real quick is um that uh the baby elephants

327
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.039
in Africa, they grow up in that Natal family

328
00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:57.719
we described and then when they're, you know,

329
00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:00.759
1112, 13, they are either pushed out or

330
00:19:00.769 --> 00:19:03.519
they go out and they join, um, uh

331
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:06.380
, older males, what they call an all bull

332
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.019
group or area. And they spend at least 15

333
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:11.219
years, um, in association with this bull society

334
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:15.199
, male society. So there is not that kind

335
00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.750
of segregation that we see. We see this very

336
00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.828
much cooper and I would say just not even a

337
00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:23.670
division. It's just everyone has the same goal and

338
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.559
they work with each other to make it work in

339
00:19:26.568 --> 00:19:29.068
the best way possible for the babies and each other

340
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.269
. Mhm uh And so I guess that one very

341
00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:40.180
important topic also to talk about here is attachment theory

342
00:19:40.189 --> 00:19:41.420
. I guess it is very important in the context

343
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.368
of your book as was originally developed, I think

344
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.789
by Doctor John Bulby and then over the decades further

345
00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:55.713
developed by other researchers and scholar. So what would

346
00:19:55.723 --> 00:19:57.795
you say are perhaps some of the main insights that

347
00:19:57.805 --> 00:20:02.394
we got from attachment theory when it comes to having

348
00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:07.193
a better understanding of perhaps the social needs that we

349
00:20:07.203 --> 00:20:12.713
and other species might have and how we establish social

350
00:20:12.723 --> 00:20:19.930
relationships with other people. I'll start uh attachment has

351
00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:23.390
to do with relation, relational belonging, essentially and

352
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:29.598
connectedness and maintaining that um those years when the brain

353
00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:32.049
is growing so quickly that, you know, it's

354
00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:33.449
, it's setting up its worldview, its sense of

355
00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:37.338
self, its sense of relationships. And so uh

356
00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:41.068
the uh attachment promoting care which is evolve nest,

357
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.670
then establish this this deep sense of security and safety

358
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.858
and relation and, and skilled, knowing how to

359
00:20:49.868 --> 00:20:55.000
, you know, stop and start relationships or conversations

360
00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:59.539
and recognizing who's trustworthy and um just being able to

361
00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:02.920
maintain relationships across time, babies have to learn a

362
00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.338
lot of non verbal skills before language comes about around

363
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.059
age two. And a lot of that is this

364
00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:12.358
relational kind of socio emotional intelligence. So it has

365
00:21:12.368 --> 00:21:15.170
also to do with your own uh understanding of your

366
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.920
own emotions and conveying those in ways that are appropriate

367
00:21:19.078 --> 00:21:23.269
um with your uh relational experience in the moment?

368
00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:30.578
A and is it uh just about, or is

369
00:21:30.588 --> 00:21:34.420
it even primarily about the mother infant diet or does

370
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.969
it go beyond that? Because I mean, at

371
00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:42.989
least when we commonly hear about attachment and attachment theory

372
00:21:44.088 --> 00:21:47.660
, it's it tends to be mostly focused on the

373
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.000
mother, sometimes the other caregivers like the father,

374
00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:55.739
for example, but people do not at least commonly

375
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.759
talk about other kinds of social relationships. But if

376
00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:02.400
I understand it correctly, it goes beyond that.

377
00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:06.279
Right. Right. So in Western civilization, which

378
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:11.789
has become patriarchal uh and emphasize the nuclear family,

379
00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:12.799
all you have is mom, dad and the Children

380
00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:15.729
, right, the emphasis of Western scholars has been

381
00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:18.469
to look at the mother child diet because that's the

382
00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.979
framework, the assumption that that's normal, but that

383
00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:26.625
isn't normal for our species. Our species raised Children

384
00:22:26.634 --> 00:22:30.203
in multiple aged, multi gender groups. And so

385
00:22:30.213 --> 00:22:32.344
really the way I look at it is, mother

386
00:22:32.354 --> 00:22:36.114
provides the first attachment and then she's the bridge to

387
00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:38.314
the attachment to everyone else around. So that even

388
00:22:38.324 --> 00:22:41.045
in some uh societies, I think the booty,

389
00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:45.739
the the infant after a few days is passed around

390
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:49.650
uh to the group, uh whatever size it is

391
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.650
and the baby starts to get a sense of different

392
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.529
smells and different uh patterns of movement and gets comfortable

393
00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:00.039
with all that and and builds a really a a

394
00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:06.505
very a fabric supportive care around them. So they

395
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:07.943
, and they become attached even more than just to

396
00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:11.404
people, to the natural world, around them,

397
00:23:11.414 --> 00:23:14.104
to the animals and plants that they live with and

398
00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:17.144
uh interact with. And so it's much broader,

399
00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:21.005
this attachment, this sense of being belonging and connected

400
00:23:21.104 --> 00:23:26.334
and relationally um kind of supported than what the Westerners

401
00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:30.868
uh are studying and talk about. But what are

402
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.160
essentially the factors that lead to the development of a

403
00:23:34.239 --> 00:23:41.640
secure attachment style and not uh let's say non secure

404
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.130
attachment style that could be an anxious, violent or

405
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.390
disorganized kind of attachment style, but it has to

406
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.098
do with the predictability of the caregivers. So providing

407
00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:57.019
the evolved nest, so providing breastfeeding when the child

408
00:23:57.029 --> 00:24:02.108
signals they want uh touch. When in our ancestral

409
00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:06.049
context, nomadic foraging communities, babies aren't put down

410
00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:08.750
, they're carried everywhere because they know uh they had

411
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:14.689
intuitions about how that baby is so vulnerable and required

412
00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:18.529
such uh intensive care of uh to develop well.

413
00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:22.420
And so the baby is having um relationships that are

414
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:29.559
um always responsive and nurturing in terms of touch and

415
00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:33.809
just listening and emotionally honest and delightful. And in

416
00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:37.390
those situations, the baby learns that everything is,

417
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.848
you know, you can predict it and um I'm

418
00:24:38.858 --> 00:24:42.759
safe and these people are trustworthy and all that insecure

419
00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:47.449
attachment comes from un inconsistent care. Uh We,

420
00:24:47.459 --> 00:24:51.519
and we uh see that not in nomadic foraging communities

421
00:24:51.529 --> 00:24:53.890
unless there's been some horrible accident or something. Uh

422
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.939
But in modern culture where babies are kind of,

423
00:24:56.949 --> 00:25:03.449
you know, more like possessions than objects of control

424
00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:06.029
. And uh when babies are left alone or left

425
00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:10.259
to cry, uh and isolated physically, they're not

426
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:12.910
gonna feel that sense of belonging and safety and security

427
00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:18.338
. And so we unfortunately have cultural myths about how

428
00:25:18.348 --> 00:25:19.789
important it is to make babies independent, you know

429
00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:22.439
, and oh, you're gonna spoil the baby if

430
00:25:22.449 --> 00:25:23.989
you pick them up too much and all these crazy

431
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.799
ideas uh that actually undermine health for the long term

432
00:25:30.068 --> 00:25:32.049
. So when you can, when you uh build

433
00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:33.858
an insecure attachment, which could be anxious or avoiding

434
00:25:33.868 --> 00:25:37.410
depending on uh exactly when and how you were treated

435
00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:41.160
when you're insecure you, uh it means your neurobiology

436
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.199
has been shaped to be, you know, kind

437
00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:47.170
of disregulation and you don't maybe know how to make

438
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.650
friends and you don't know how to maintain a friendship

439
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.890
and you don't know how to recognize a trustworthy relationship

440
00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:53.689
. And so it gets you into all sorts of

441
00:25:53.699 --> 00:25:59.055
trouble. Uh prof uh professors tend to have avoidant

442
00:25:59.064 --> 00:26:00.973
attachment, which is this detached way of looking at

443
00:26:00.983 --> 00:26:04.414
things not emotionally available because that's how, what they

444
00:26:04.424 --> 00:26:07.983
experienced as babies. And so it's very easy to

445
00:26:07.993 --> 00:26:08.934
go in the Ivory Tower and make up stuff,

446
00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:11.604
you know, and then apply your, you know

447
00:26:11.614 --> 00:26:12.983
, your little model to the world. Maybe it

448
00:26:12.993 --> 00:26:15.364
works, maybe it doesn't, but you get a

449
00:26:15.375 --> 00:26:18.094
publication and, you know, you're not committed and

450
00:26:18.104 --> 00:26:22.130
emotionally attuned. Um And so we've created a world

451
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.910
where we reward that kind of um avoid an attachment

452
00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:30.000
uh with, you know, status and such and

453
00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:33.289
that's destructive to the planet. It's destructive to nature

454
00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:37.078
because we're not relationally attuned with our emotions, with

455
00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:38.900
our commitment, with our moral commitment to the well

456
00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:45.160
being of everyone human and nonhuman around us. And

457
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.959
, and I would say that um John boldly really

458
00:26:48.969 --> 00:26:52.019
made quite a contribution because he really made visible,

459
00:26:52.108 --> 00:26:56.078
the invisible, which was this notion of the importance

460
00:26:56.088 --> 00:27:00.719
of relationship and the quality of relationship. But within

461
00:27:00.729 --> 00:27:02.828
that, again, this is not a criticism because

462
00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:06.009
that's a it's a step in the evolution of the

463
00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:10.019
western cultures way of looking at things. You're still

464
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:12.828
having one thing attaching to another thing. And when

465
00:27:12.838 --> 00:27:17.838
you look through the lens of nonhuman nature, everyone's

466
00:27:17.848 --> 00:27:19.509
attached, there is no attachment, there are no

467
00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:25.630
strings, it's all one big soup. So quote

468
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.229
, unquote, attachment is just the way animals live

469
00:27:30.739 --> 00:27:33.989
. And so that the, the specificity of it

470
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.279
, for example, the, the importance of the

471
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:37.838
mother with the nursing, the way Darsha was discussing

472
00:27:37.848 --> 00:27:40.529
it or the, the, the way that the

473
00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:41.449
, the passing of the egg with the father,

474
00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:45.049
those are important elements, but it's all everyone's attached

475
00:27:45.709 --> 00:27:49.380
. It's the non attachment that um Darsha was talking

476
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.709
about in the sense of some kind of perturbation,

477
00:27:52.719 --> 00:27:55.838
some kind of, you know, causing a gap

478
00:27:55.848 --> 00:28:00.390
or schism between you and me. Um or you

479
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.739
know, the baby and the parent or whatever that

480
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.910
is, that's the anomaly. And, and essentially

481
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.459
so, like I said, when we look from

482
00:28:07.588 --> 00:28:11.219
through the baseline of nonhuman nature, there is no

483
00:28:11.229 --> 00:28:14.588
attachment. It's we, we are all attached and

484
00:28:14.598 --> 00:28:18.608
that's really what we're coming back into. And um

485
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.630
and, and the work that we've done together is

486
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.660
really trying to bridge that and, and move us

487
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:27.259
into this paradigm of the baseline of we're all attached

488
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:30.479
. We, we are, we just are in

489
00:28:30.489 --> 00:28:33.529
that way. So the evolved nest is about meeting

490
00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:36.430
basic needs, everyone's basic needs. There's no argument

491
00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:38.049
about meeting the needs that you just provide and that

492
00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:41.729
and nature's gift economy is that way too. You

493
00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:44.269
take the fruit and then you, you, your

494
00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:48.410
waste becomes some other animals uh food. And uh

495
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.789
it's just this ongoing cycle of giving and taking and

496
00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:55.414
giving without uh a sense of disconnection, right?

497
00:28:55.424 --> 00:28:56.443
You're just in it like uh gay said in a

498
00:28:56.453 --> 00:29:00.354
soup and what the Western world has done is just

499
00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:03.684
divided and disconnected all over the place, disconnected body

500
00:29:03.693 --> 00:29:08.983
from mind, uh spirit from uh humanity. Uh

501
00:29:08.993 --> 00:29:14.324
It's just a, a big mess of division that

502
00:29:14.434 --> 00:29:17.193
I, we hope our book will help people realize

503
00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:18.664
that that's not the way we evolved to be and

504
00:29:18.674 --> 00:29:22.078
that's not helpful for the planet. And then,

505
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.400
yeah, go ahead and just real quick. I

506
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.068
think what's a challenge? And we're hoping as Darsha

507
00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:32.750
said that the book will help, you know,

508
00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:37.689
support people make that shift is essentially from one paradigm

509
00:29:37.699 --> 00:29:40.588
of dualism. We can call it dualism pieces.

510
00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:41.890
You know, all the pieces. You me,

511
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.769
they, we all those things into oneness into non

512
00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:51.380
dualism. And it really takes um either an experience

513
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.880
or a leap of faith. But you, you

514
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.150
, you at one point, you have to kind

515
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.880
of jump in, you have to jump in and

516
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.170
say, do we see ourselves as you and me

517
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.709
and separate that we're putting together an assemblage? Or

518
00:30:06.259 --> 00:30:08.459
are we just one of which I'm an expression?

519
00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:11.289
You're an expression of a part, et cetera.

520
00:30:11.848 --> 00:30:15.979
And that's really what this is an example of,

521
00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:21.750
of, of um encouraging people to jump into that

522
00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:25.170
new view because then the other pieces like the elements

523
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.868
of the evolved nest, they just kind of come

524
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.949
out naturally. I mean, there may be some

525
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.529
questions like, well, how do I do this

526
00:30:30.539 --> 00:30:32.390
? How do I transition, you know, I

527
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.029
don't have a grandparent or whatever, but then solutions

528
00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:37.670
start to come up. OK? We don't have

529
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.779
grandparents, but we have our neighbors. Let's start

530
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:42.868
to talk with our neighbors and create this kind of

531
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.689
um you know, mosaic um that, that,

532
00:30:48.699 --> 00:30:52.049
that moves into to oneness. So we're talking about

533
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:56.170
in inter being, right? We are all uh

534
00:30:56.368 --> 00:30:57.479
you are me, I am you, it's uh

535
00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:00.890
there's no real separation. We're just, you know

536
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.618
, little uh pieces of the whole, the implicate

537
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.848
order and our uh ability to de differentiate ourselves to

538
00:31:07.858 --> 00:31:11.209
see how we're alike, to see how we are

539
00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:15.368
connected. And all in this flowing dynamic universe is

540
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.108
really our aim here and the animal uh images and

541
00:31:19.118 --> 00:31:22.390
how they, they know this, right? We

542
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.078
have so much to learn from our animal kin.

543
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.670
Uh And so we hope that's what the book will

544
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.630
. Uh But at a certain point there, you

545
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:37.118
mentioned uh needs uh what are needs exactly or perhaps

546
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.858
a better question is where do they come from exactly

547
00:31:40.868 --> 00:31:45.618
what constitutes a child's in need? And I mean

548
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.368
, since uh of course, in the book,

549
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:52.650
we explore other nonhuman species, uh does that mean

550
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.489
that perhaps some of the of these needs are quote

551
00:31:56.519 --> 00:32:01.189
unquote, hard wired or uh are there are Children

552
00:32:01.199 --> 00:32:06.559
perhaps at least to some extent responsive to the eco

553
00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:09.489
uh the ecology they develop in uh when it comes

554
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:15.068
to developing their own specific needs? Well, the

555
00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:16.769
way I look at it and gay can uh add

556
00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:21.108
her perception. Uh the way I look at it

557
00:32:21.118 --> 00:32:23.140
is that we're animals. And so we all need

558
00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:27.789
some nourishment. We need shelter, we need protection

559
00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:30.848
, we need warmth, uh or else we die

560
00:32:30.858 --> 00:32:34.568
, right? But, but we're also mammals,

561
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:37.650
social mammals and we need affection to grow. Well

562
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.279
, we need the touch, right? We need

563
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:42.269
play to grow well, so basic needs to grow

564
00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:45.309
the optimal uh kind of member of the species.

565
00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:49.118
That's what you want to meet. And that's we

566
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.318
have to identify uh basic needs by what leads to

567
00:32:52.328 --> 00:32:55.170
optimality. And we also are humans, we need

568
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.088
to have meaning uh and make meaning. And so

569
00:32:59.098 --> 00:33:01.358
the stories that our culture tells us, guides our

570
00:33:01.368 --> 00:33:06.910
behavior and guides our, our desires, our experiences

571
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.640
build our desires, right? To be close and

572
00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:12.930
affectionate or distant and detached, right? Depending on

573
00:33:12.939 --> 00:33:15.088
the kind of early experience you had. So basic

574
00:33:15.098 --> 00:33:20.630
needs really lead to optimization of the individual and the

575
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.969
community. Now, uh Maslow has had his hierarchy

576
00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:28.559
of needs. He learned he got inspired by the

577
00:33:28.568 --> 00:33:31.689
Blackfoot nation, the six AA. And unfortunately,

578
00:33:31.699 --> 00:33:37.019
he turned it upside down because for the Blackfoot self

579
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:39.969
actualization is fundamental in primary and that's what the evolved

580
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.519
N does. For each individual. It fosters your

581
00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:45.430
uniqueness, you can unfold and blossom because all your

582
00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:47.229
needs are being mad and everybody loves you and you

583
00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:50.789
feel like you belong. But he put that as

584
00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:52.509
the end point, the end point for the Blackfoot

585
00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:58.289
is cultural perpetuity community well being so that the culture

586
00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:00.019
will, and that means the bio community that in

587
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:04.500
, in which you're entangled is going to live into

588
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:07.010
the future seven generations, right? And we,

589
00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:10.289
you know, uh Maslow got very individualistic, which

590
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:15.050
is the western way instead of this communal orientation that

591
00:34:15.418 --> 00:34:19.039
, that understands that we don't become our best selves

592
00:34:19.048 --> 00:34:21.518
unless we have those basic needs met all along the

593
00:34:21.528 --> 00:34:25.378
way throughout life. Mhm A and what I,

594
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:31.708
in what ways can early life experiences have far reaching

595
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:37.438
impacts? Well, that's what I write about uh

596
00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.449
quite a bit uh in terms of morality. Um

597
00:34:39.458 --> 00:34:45.039
but it's also social capacities. So uh as I

598
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.769
mentioned earlier, within secure attachment, you're kind of

599
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.208
uh hampered, you have a uh inability unless you

600
00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.050
heal it later with some interventions. Uh you get

601
00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:57.579
along that well with others. Now, my work

602
00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.128
looks at how our early experience, if you stress

603
00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:04.989
a baby so that they learn to be uh threat

604
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.360
, reactive, stress, reactive because they've been stressed

605
00:35:07.369 --> 00:35:09.969
so much that stress response is easily triggered, that's

606
00:35:09.978 --> 00:35:13.840
gonna shape how they act with others and their moral

607
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:15.519
decisions. What's right? What's wrong? And in

608
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.110
the moment, they'll be more likely to feel afraid

609
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:22.469
and brace against others, brace against life instead of

610
00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:24.239
being open hearted and flexible, you know, and

611
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:28.478
attuned. So, uh that's gonna affect how they

612
00:35:28.489 --> 00:35:30.590
think about the world, they'll be more likely to

613
00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:34.235
have, uh, scripted, rigid ideas of black

614
00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:37.563
and white up and down, more oriented to dominance

615
00:35:37.574 --> 00:35:38.793
hierarchies. You know, either you're either up or

616
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:40.885
you're down, you're either a winner or a loser

617
00:35:40.994 --> 00:35:44.235
, that kind of orientation. And each moment they

618
00:35:44.244 --> 00:35:45.434
can bring, uh, if they feel unsafe in

619
00:35:45.445 --> 00:35:49.313
the moment they're gonna go into that mode and their

620
00:35:49.324 --> 00:35:51.784
, their morality then is gonna affect everyone else.

621
00:35:52.708 --> 00:35:57.208
I mean, we're seeing far reaching, we're experiencing

622
00:35:57.648 --> 00:36:00.590
the far reaching effects of, of early development.

623
00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:05.199
I mean, if you look at the history of

624
00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:07.469
, of humanity over the last, we'll just say

625
00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:10.159
102 100 years, uh it has been violent,

626
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:15.179
it has been breaking down, it's been um insecure

627
00:36:15.188 --> 00:36:19.688
attachment, generating writ large and none of that has

628
00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:22.019
been processed. So when you have someone who is

629
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.929
severely traumatized um through genocide, through poverty, through

630
00:36:25.938 --> 00:36:30.708
the industrial technological development, which has gotten intensified.

631
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.199
Um the, the they're, they're thrust back into

632
00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:36.519
it and there really is an Ame or of there

633
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:43.239
isn't a um a healing, a receiving healing community

634
00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:45.969
. So even though a baby is brought up in

635
00:36:45.978 --> 00:36:49.309
a certain that's obviously very critical. But the community

636
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.648
, in other words, the culture has to be

637
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:57.570
one that uh supports that individual. And if they're

638
00:36:57.579 --> 00:36:59.918
not, if they're the same thing in a sense

639
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.110
, you just continue on this very, very destructive

640
00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:05.139
path, which is what we see right now.

641
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.989
And unfortunately, in the nonhuman world. That's why

642
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.309
you're seeing PTSD complex ptsd just to use technical terms

643
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.050
among African elephants never existed. Nothing like that.

644
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.728
The orc is off Spain, nothing like that.

645
00:37:20.378 --> 00:37:22.119
And, and so, you know, we,

646
00:37:22.128 --> 00:37:23.489
we can just analyze it from a very narrow view

647
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.840
of neuropsychology. But essentially, you're seeing this profound

648
00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:32.289
ricocheting of, you know, one child experiencing insecure

649
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:37.039
attachment and then it perpetuating, perpetuating, perpetuating without

650
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.309
any kind of balance in terms of healing that individual

651
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.449
. And there are individual cultures, human cultures that

652
00:37:44.458 --> 00:37:46.469
have a very different way when an individual uh for

653
00:37:46.478 --> 00:37:51.860
whatever reason, um sort of steps out the bounds

654
00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.699
of morality, what do they do? They do

655
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:57.619
not expel that individual, they gather around, they

656
00:37:57.628 --> 00:38:00.978
absorb, it's inclusive. And again, what Darsha

657
00:38:00.989 --> 00:38:02.429
was talking is about that inter being, it's our

658
00:38:02.438 --> 00:38:08.820
responsibility for that person, that individual. And so

659
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:12.110
that's, you know, these are elements of socialism

660
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:14.239
, right? Where it has to do with the

661
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.869
fact of that um your poverty or my poverty or

662
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:21.019
their poverty or their problem, quote unquote is my

663
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.860
problem. So it's a very different what this is

664
00:38:22.869 --> 00:38:27.079
really saying is is that in order for us to

665
00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:29.949
uh heal, in order for us to bring cohesion

666
00:38:29.958 --> 00:38:32.840
and well being back on the planet within our species

667
00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:37.019
and then the entire planet, which is made chaotic

668
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.619
by our human behavior is that we have to be

669
00:38:39.628 --> 00:38:43.659
inclusive. We don't shut them away in prisons,

670
00:38:43.668 --> 00:38:45.099
we don't stick people away and get rid of them

671
00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.820
, we bring them back and a number of the

672
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:51.159
indigenous societies, that's how they function. They,

673
00:38:51.168 --> 00:38:52.489
they, they sort of, you know, absorb

674
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.208
that individual. And again, that's another lesson of

675
00:38:57.219 --> 00:39:00.309
the evolved nest. It's not just a person with

676
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.409
a mother or with a father, it's um,

677
00:39:01.418 --> 00:39:05.909
it's an organism. So, really, although we

678
00:39:05.918 --> 00:39:07.628
talk a lot about child raising and things like that

679
00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:13.309
, it really comes down to, um, revitalizing

680
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.699
those elements of the evolved nest which are in,

681
00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:17.708
I think chapter 10 or whatever, they're sort of

682
00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:20.619
listed. I mean, they're not, they're just

683
00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:23.340
kind of pointers to something which is much of a

684
00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:27.898
, but that's really the focus is that, that's

685
00:39:27.909 --> 00:39:29.708
how we can start on the path, that's how

686
00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:32.458
we can break the cycle. Mhm. Uh And

687
00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:36.769
do you think that perhaps some of the issues that

688
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:42.059
we are experiencing in industrialized and post industrial societies nowadays

689
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.668
have to do with some of these more individualistic values

690
00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:50.648
that we have where people are raised to think that

691
00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:54.349
perhaps they shouldn't uh try to depend so much on

692
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.958
others and there's not so much the sense of community

693
00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:00.800
. Uh I mean, uh also because I guess

694
00:40:00.809 --> 00:40:05.820
that, uh uh looking at our own evolutionary history

695
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:07.590
and, uh, and other species, we are

696
00:40:07.688 --> 00:40:13.239
very much dependent on others. And I mean,

697
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:17.954
that idea that the, just an isolated individual,

698
00:40:17.965 --> 00:40:21.554
uh and, uh, and the, if it's

699
00:40:21.563 --> 00:40:25.184
not that then you're like spoiled or something like that

700
00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:30.744
and you are just completely over dependent on others.

701
00:40:30.753 --> 00:40:34.215
I mean, that's uh incorrect. That's it.

702
00:40:34.273 --> 00:40:37.235
It's particularly strong here, I think in the United

703
00:40:37.244 --> 00:40:40.273
States. Um, and I think it's unfortunately spread

704
00:40:40.284 --> 00:40:45.469
but it, it's considered something negative or bad to

705
00:40:45.478 --> 00:40:50.398
say I need, I need to something, you

706
00:40:50.409 --> 00:40:52.000
know, can you help me out? Um,

707
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:55.500
there's a lot of shame associated with that and for

708
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.750
the rejection. So you get this spiral. So

709
00:40:59.938 --> 00:41:01.349
, you know, to show kind of vulnerability is

710
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.199
really considered to be something is used on as,

711
00:41:05.208 --> 00:41:07.489
as, as prey. We have a predator,

712
00:41:07.628 --> 00:41:10.208
we've developed a predatorial culture. So when there's someone

713
00:41:10.219 --> 00:41:15.228
who is, who shows vulnerability, um they're rejected

714
00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.010
and they are uh preyed upon in, in that

715
00:41:17.019 --> 00:41:21.010
way. So again, the elements of the that

716
00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:22.619
are, you know, sort of itemized in the

717
00:41:22.628 --> 00:41:30.139
evolved nest to highlight certain things really are um paths

718
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.489
and principles which can really help our culture. Um

719
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.188
Our species return to, I would believe it's,

720
00:41:37.199 --> 00:41:39.739
it's natural goodness where you want to call it in

721
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.159
in that way. So I can add a little

722
00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:47.938
bit more um when we under care for chil young

723
00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:52.320
Children. So don't provide the nest, we're undermining

724
00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:54.909
the development of the right hemisphere, the right hemisphere

725
00:41:54.918 --> 00:41:58.628
is scheduled to grow more rapidly. And it's the

726
00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:02.530
part of our brain that is oriented to dynamic relationships

727
00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:07.050
and living things and has a sense of uh it's

728
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:10.489
the seed of our self-regulation initially and empathy and higher

729
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.429
consciousness. And when we under care for Children,

730
00:42:15.438 --> 00:42:16.978
that's uh you know, not developed so well.

731
00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:20.628
And then they have to rely on the survival systems

732
00:42:20.639 --> 00:42:22.958
that are innate so that dominance, uh submission and

733
00:42:22.969 --> 00:42:28.659
territoriality and rivalry things. Um part of the reptilian

734
00:42:28.668 --> 00:42:30.530
brain, right? Um I mean, it's insulting

735
00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:35.550
reptiles but um and then we send them to school

736
00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:37.519
and train their left brain. Left brain is all

737
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.309
in the ego consciousness. It thinks it knows everything

738
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.500
, it doesn't know very much. It's good at

739
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.409
linear, you know, kind of analysis, but

740
00:42:45.418 --> 00:42:50.679
it can't deal with dynamism, it likes static objects

741
00:42:50.688 --> 00:42:52.590
, things it can measure, you know, and

742
00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:54.289
so the western world has been taken over by the

743
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.934
left hemisphere and this is Ian mcgilchrist Point and is

744
00:42:58.945 --> 00:43:01.164
running us, of course into the grave because we

745
00:43:01.175 --> 00:43:05.695
forgot how to develop, how to foster an integrated

746
00:43:05.704 --> 00:43:07.655
brain. Both halves are really important. But we

747
00:43:07.664 --> 00:43:09.974
have now put ourselves in the hands of this very

748
00:43:09.985 --> 00:43:15.813
detached robotic part of ourselves and guided by survival systems

749
00:43:15.824 --> 00:43:17.695
, you know. So predation is part of the

750
00:43:17.704 --> 00:43:23.059
left brain's orientation, manipulation of the world. Yeah

751
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.860
. And as, as Dar brought up the,

752
00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:27.909
the, the notion of the reptilian brain is kind

753
00:43:27.918 --> 00:43:31.128
of an artifact from science that reptiles, uh tortoises

754
00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:35.260
and alligators, rattlesnakes, they all have the same

755
00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:37.610
brain that we do and they all show uh the

756
00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:40.148
same what we would call prosocial behavior, they care

757
00:43:40.159 --> 00:43:43.869
for each other's young. They are non a grass

758
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.938
, um, they're very, um, community oriented

759
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.809
and, um, they don't strike in violence except

760
00:43:52.878 --> 00:43:55.869
, you know, when it's absolutely necessary. And

761
00:43:55.878 --> 00:43:58.510
so, you know, those are the kinds of

762
00:43:58.519 --> 00:44:00.250
myths which is also, have come along with,

763
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:05.849
this is, um, uh, separating ourselves.

764
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.550
Oh, we're not like them now, whether that's

765
00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:13.409
another animal or whether it's another human and valor these

766
00:44:13.418 --> 00:44:15.039
aspects that, of the left brain in the,

767
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.628
in the language of neuroscience that Darsh has been talking

768
00:44:17.639 --> 00:44:22.110
about and that's very, very deep conditioning. So

769
00:44:22.119 --> 00:44:22.978
in the case of, you know, that this

770
00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:24.860
is this whole, you know, schooling the world

771
00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:27.539
, you know, even if you brought up,

772
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.699
you know, um and, and I can have

773
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:31.559
personal experience growing if you grow up in an evolved

774
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.659
nest kind of situation, but you're shunted into this

775
00:44:35.668 --> 00:44:39.090
conveyor belt of um you know, II I it's

776
00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:42.760
kind of a sociopathy, you know, where you're

777
00:44:42.769 --> 00:44:46.340
basically punished in various ways and not just physical but

778
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:51.728
socially, all those things you're conditioned into letting go

779
00:44:51.739 --> 00:44:55.090
of the right brain into uh into sort of squelching

780
00:44:55.429 --> 00:45:00.809
these wonderful and beautiful feelings inside that are natural,

781
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.869
which seed and nurture those uh um within those that

782
00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:08.030
you, that you meet. So we're, we're

783
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:10.898
put into this conveyor belt and then that becomes a

784
00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:14.949
matter of quote unquote survival. If you're not like

785
00:45:14.958 --> 00:45:17.820
this, then you don't belong and you're excluded.

786
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:21.860
And unfortunately, it's evolved to such a system where

787
00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:22.739
it really comes down to, are you with us

788
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.519
or are you against us? We see that in

789
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.219
political systems, we see that in social systems,

790
00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:31.519
et cetera. So it's really this move to um

791
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.719
you know, taking back our wholeness, taking back

792
00:45:35.728 --> 00:45:38.918
ourselves. And in that, which is critical is

793
00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:44.269
understanding that nonhumans, that's why it works for billions

794
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.668
of years. That's why nature has worked for billions

795
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:49.760
of years. And so we can say, OK

796
00:45:49.769 --> 00:45:51.478
, I'm, I'm gonna side with them. I'm

797
00:45:51.489 --> 00:45:53.039
gonna side with nature. I wanna be more like

798
00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.090
nature, I wanna be more like the penguins.

799
00:45:55.099 --> 00:46:00.199
I wanna be more like the wolves and by making

800
00:46:00.208 --> 00:46:02.199
that kind of solidarity, that kind of commitment saying

801
00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:07.820
those are my people, these are my kin then

802
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:12.739
that in itself opens up an incredible amount of the

803
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.289
life force that really is responsible for creating this incredible

804
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.269
planet that we live on. Mhm So I would

805
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.469
like to ask you now, since in the book

806
00:46:23.478 --> 00:46:27.668
, you talk a lot about what we can learn

807
00:46:27.679 --> 00:46:31.510
from traditional societies, indigenous societies, for example,

808
00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:38.429
uh because in modern industrialized and post industrial societies,

809
00:46:38.438 --> 00:46:43.559
even with the issues that we have. Uh some

810
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:49.019
of them we've talked here about today, um we

811
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.679
still have many positive things like for example, some

812
00:46:52.688 --> 00:46:59.010
very positive technological advancements that make our lives better and

813
00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:00.648
easier. So I would like to ask you,

814
00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:06.599
how do you think we could perhaps strike a balance

815
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:12.668
here between some of the positives of those more traditional

816
00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:19.168
societies without perhaps having to ditch, uh, the

817
00:47:19.179 --> 00:47:22.610
other positive things that we have in our, uh

818
00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:29.510
, industrialized societies. Well, I think, um

819
00:47:30.168 --> 00:47:32.639
, it's a tough question actually, but there are

820
00:47:32.648 --> 00:47:37.628
traditional societies who weren't nomadic foragers who have lived with

821
00:47:37.639 --> 00:47:40.119
localization where they have their, you know, they

822
00:47:40.128 --> 00:47:43.539
raise their own food, they, they have their

823
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.510
own energy. They have, they use the cycle

824
00:47:45.519 --> 00:47:46.648
of, of life on their farms, right?

825
00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:50.824
So the waste from the animals or themselves goes into

826
00:47:50.833 --> 00:47:53.784
the garden and grows as the natural uh fertilizer.

827
00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:57.853
So they, they're not poisoning the the soil,

828
00:47:57.864 --> 00:48:01.054
they're not dishonoring uh this the earth and they have

829
00:48:01.063 --> 00:48:05.284
ways of being that are tuned in to the well

830
00:48:05.293 --> 00:48:07.293
being of that landscape right there. So I think

831
00:48:07.304 --> 00:48:09.333
we have to go back to these small kind of

832
00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:14.760
communities and then perhaps with the renewable energies, we

833
00:48:14.769 --> 00:48:17.909
can still maintain zoom conversations, for example, those

834
00:48:17.918 --> 00:48:22.679
are nice. Yeah, I would like to keep

835
00:48:22.688 --> 00:48:27.010
having those. Yeah, but we don't need so

836
00:48:27.019 --> 00:48:30.000
much. I mean, there's so much wastefulness um

837
00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:34.000
in our because it makes money for people and it

838
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.369
raises the G GDP, right? The more you

839
00:48:37.378 --> 00:48:39.300
waste. So we have to get back to understanding

840
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:45.139
that we are relational uh beings and every um plant

841
00:48:45.148 --> 00:48:47.728
animal river mountain is part of our kin and we

842
00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:51.208
need to be concerned about their well being and not

843
00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:54.079
be greedy for what we think we need. But

844
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:57.110
you know, the early under care is gonna lead

845
00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:59.909
us to be more greedy and trying to make up

846
00:48:59.918 --> 00:49:01.563
for that hole we have in our heart from disconnection

847
00:49:01.574 --> 00:49:07.344
from uh disrespected um early childhood. So we have

848
00:49:07.353 --> 00:49:08.853
to kind of work at multiple levels. Bring back

849
00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:12.264
the evolved n for the young re nest, the

850
00:49:12.273 --> 00:49:15.925
adults get them calmed down, get them more tuned

851
00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:20.494
in to the the cosmos, to their relational responsibilities

852
00:49:20.503 --> 00:49:22.885
, feel more at ease and at peace being a

853
00:49:22.894 --> 00:49:30.360
member of the earth community. Uh And so perhaps

854
00:49:30.369 --> 00:49:31.989
just one last question and I have asked you about

855
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.659
traditional society. So when comparing ourselves to other animals

856
00:49:37.668 --> 00:49:42.269
and we've gone through several examples here today. Uh

857
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.688
what do you think we can learn from them that

858
00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:52.079
would be applicable to human societies? Well, I'll

859
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:55.179
continue with what Darsha said. Um I don't think

860
00:49:55.188 --> 00:49:58.760
we need any of the things that we call um

861
00:49:58.769 --> 00:50:00.929
human achievements. I mean, all of those things

862
00:50:00.938 --> 00:50:06.820
are prosthetics that are substitutes for what the evolved nest

863
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.489
and the rest of nature lives by and provides.

864
00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:13.179
Um I mean, zoom. Zoom is wonderful because

865
00:50:13.188 --> 00:50:14.869
we get to meet you and each other and,

866
00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:16.438
and things like that. But uh if we were

867
00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:19.309
living together and whatever, we, we don't need

868
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.489
that. I mean, I may not, I

869
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.949
may have never met you. Um which would be

870
00:50:22.958 --> 00:50:27.500
sad, but at the same time, how sad

871
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.309
. I mean, in other words, they,

872
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.000
what we, there's so much loss that is uh

873
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:35.219
associated with the things that we think have gained us

874
00:50:35.228 --> 00:50:37.829
. I see these as this is their intermediate steps

875
00:50:37.489 --> 00:50:39.340
and that we need to give up those kinds of

876
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:43.250
things. They, they really, they keep us

877
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.269
, I mean, right now, they provide an

878
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.820
incredible ability to kind of revitalize and communicate and kind

879
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:52.280
of get back to where we are. But none

880
00:50:52.289 --> 00:50:54.539
of the rest of the other species need what we

881
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:59.039
say we need and they do very well and they're

882
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.849
very happy. So all the things we cherish,

883
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.168
like wellness and good relationships and security and peace.

884
00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:08.550
That's what the animal world has without modern humans.

885
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.869
And so if it really gets down to that,

886
00:51:10.878 --> 00:51:13.610
I think we just really need to sort of say

887
00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:15.349
, well, we don't really need all these things

888
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.570
. These are just transitional objects that move us into

889
00:51:19.579 --> 00:51:22.280
what Darsha was talking about. Um and life will

890
00:51:22.289 --> 00:51:27.208
be much better. So II, I think it's

891
00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:29.898
not just um I think, I think we need

892
00:51:29.909 --> 00:51:32.039
to aspire to be who the animals are and who

893
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:37.878
the trees and the plants are. And those with

894
00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:40.639
those with insecure attachment tend to be quite restless.

895
00:51:40.648 --> 00:51:45.250
They don't feel at ease and because of course,

896
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.219
they didn't, they didn't get their needs met.

897
00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:47.519
And so they, they're anxious, you know,

898
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.969
where am I gonna get them met? And so

899
00:51:49.978 --> 00:51:52.739
you try all these things, addictions and various things

900
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.228
to try to calm down. Um, but if

901
00:51:55.239 --> 00:51:59.280
, if we provide the evolved nest or when we

902
00:51:59.289 --> 00:52:02.750
have nested lives, we have a fullness of now

903
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.929
. We feel connected to everything now and we see

904
00:52:06.938 --> 00:52:08.090
all the dynamism and we can hardly, you know

905
00:52:08.239 --> 00:52:12.590
, look away from the beauty of, of life

906
00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:14.719
. Whereas when you have an under cared for,

907
00:52:14.728 --> 00:52:16.628
under nested person, they're worried and they're, you're

908
00:52:16.639 --> 00:52:19.199
thinking about the past. Oh, I did all

909
00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:21.059
that wrong and they're depressed about that and then they're

910
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:22.059
worried about the future and all and they're hardly in

911
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.958
the present moment because they didn't get enough practice for

912
00:52:25.969 --> 00:52:27.938
it. They couldn't, I mean, it was

913
00:52:27.949 --> 00:52:29.869
too painful to be in the present moment. They

914
00:52:29.878 --> 00:52:31.438
had to dissociate when they were left alone to cry

915
00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:35.809
or left alone, abandoned in some way. Uh

916
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.110
So we have to get back to the fullness of

917
00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:40.929
right hemisphere functioning, the full integrated brain where we

918
00:52:40.938 --> 00:52:45.539
feel uh this life is so beautiful and we are

919
00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.280
all in it together and let's, you know,

920
00:52:47.289 --> 00:52:51.610
sing, let's dance, let's play together. That's

921
00:52:51.619 --> 00:52:53.398
what we aim for. That's, that's the flourishing

922
00:52:53.409 --> 00:52:58.719
human community that we um see as our promise,

923
00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.099
we can still return to that. Uh And so

924
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:05.280
that's what we aim for. And I think we

925
00:53:05.289 --> 00:53:08.699
see that um individually, I think everyone, why

926
00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:12.010
it feels so nice to be in nature. Hey

927
00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:14.030
, there, there are no TV. S there

928
00:53:14.039 --> 00:53:17.340
are no iphones. Um, just being in nature

929
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:20.789
and then also just things like, um, I

930
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.679
mean, not everyone but a lot of people have

931
00:53:22.688 --> 00:53:25.840
fun having a picnic or have fun going camping.

932
00:53:27.329 --> 00:53:30.320
Well, that's because there's not all those things.

933
00:53:30.329 --> 00:53:31.958
Right. And, and there is that so that

934
00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:36.260
those are sort of touch points and, and indicators

935
00:53:36.329 --> 00:53:38.010
that that's our natural, that's our natural path,

936
00:53:38.019 --> 00:53:42.458
that's our natural inclination to well being and peace.

937
00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:45.208
So we can all go find a sit spot near

938
00:53:45.219 --> 00:53:49.628
us where we can tune into nature and go there

939
00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:52.208
regularly and that'll open up our senses. We can

940
00:53:52.219 --> 00:53:58.469
all uh be um activists for our local rivers,

941
00:53:58.478 --> 00:54:02.469
creeks, forests, um trees, animals, native

942
00:54:02.478 --> 00:54:06.719
animals. Uh you know, it just get out

943
00:54:06.728 --> 00:54:10.199
there and be committed to the bio community that you're

944
00:54:10.208 --> 00:54:15.438
a member of. Great. So I think that's

945
00:54:15.449 --> 00:54:19.389
a great message to end the interview on. Uh

946
00:54:19.398 --> 00:54:22.110
the book is again the Evolved Nest Nature's way of

947
00:54:22.119 --> 00:54:27.119
raising Children and creating connected communities. I'm leaving a

948
00:54:27.128 --> 00:54:30.228
link to it in the description box of this interview

949
00:54:30.369 --> 00:54:31.010
. Uh And by the way, would you like

950
00:54:31.019 --> 00:54:35.550
to tell people apart from the book where they can

951
00:54:35.559 --> 00:54:39.889
find you and your work on the internet? Uh

952
00:54:39.898 --> 00:54:44.949
The Evolve Nest Evolve nest.org. And we have a

953
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:49.010
movie on this uh that's based in this book.

954
00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.898
It's uh eight minutes long there. And there's a

955
00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:53.769
couple other movies too that you can watch free.

956
00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.360
No, it's a nonprofit So there's different tools for

957
00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:00.849
re nesting. We have an evolved nest curriculum you

958
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.030
can do on your own to learn about and then

959
00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:09.219
apply evolve nest principles and our um website where there's

960
00:55:09.228 --> 00:55:14.429
material as well as uh Kulas. It's www dot

961
00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:19.820
Kos K er Ul os.org and that's the Kula Center

962
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:23.898
for Nonviolence. So theres information there. Great.

963
00:55:23.909 --> 00:55:28.019
So I'm adding that also to the description of the

964
00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:31.010
