00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.449
Decent. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.109
today I'm joined by Doctor Amanda Potan. She is

4
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.640
Professor Emeritus of History at California State Polytechnic University.

5
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.469
She specializes in the study of Syria and Mesopotamia

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.909
in the middle and late Bron Bronze age. And

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.909
she is the author of books like The Land

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.729
of Hannah, the Ancient Near Eastern World Brotherhood of

9
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.370
Kings, the ancient near East, a very short introduction

10
00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:33.419
and weavers scribes and kings, a new history of

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.610
the ancient, near east. And today we're talking of

12
00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:41.130
course about Mesopotamia, the early Old Babylonian period, the

13
00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:45.994
basically the second millennium BC Hammurabi reign, kingdom of

14
00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.705
the late Bronze age and the legacy of Mesopotamia.

15
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.424
If, if we get there. So Doctor Podany, welcome

16
00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:54.994
to the show. It's a huge honor to have

17
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.044
you and I've been really a big fan of

18
00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:59.264
yours and your work. So thank you so much

19
00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:01.025
for accepting the invitation. Oh,

20
00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:03.025
thank you so much for inviting me. It's a

21
00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:03.845
pleasure to be here.

22
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.830
So to start perhaps with the most basic question

23
00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:13.449
here, what was actually Mesopotamia? Because particularly, I mean,

24
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.589
for people who are not historians or historians of

25
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.790
Mesopotamia. Actually, before I got across your work and

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.050
the work of your call, I mean, sometimes I

27
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.459
thought, oh, is Babylonia the same as Mesopotamia? What's

28
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.959
the distinction there? Because it's more common for us

29
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.800
to hear, I guess about Babylonia specifically? So what

30
00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:36.989
is Mesopotamia? Really?

31
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.650
Mesopotamia is actually the term that the Greeks gave

32
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.260
to this region. It's the region that is now

33
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:47.000
Iraq and parts of Syria. And um in ancient

34
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.379
times, there wasn't a name for the entire land,

35
00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.419
they just called it Kam, which meant the land.

36
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.580
And so uh we now have given it the

37
00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:56.620
name Mesopotamia or the Greeks did. And it's a

38
00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.779
useful name because it was a culturally um consistent

39
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.849
area from the Gulf almost to the Mediterranean Sea.

40
00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.959
Um And it's bounded of course by the Euphrates

41
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.580
River and the Tigris River because Mesopotamia means the

42
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.419
land between the rivers and it had as you

43
00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.850
suggest many different names over time, which is why

44
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.210
you get the confusion is Babylonia the same as

45
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.110
Mesopotamia. Babylonia is part of Mesopotamia. It's these sort

46
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.509
of in, in later periods, it's the southern part,

47
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.119
whereas Assyria was uh in the north and then

48
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.179
very confusingly, Assyria, a Ss and Syria are um

49
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.009
the western and eastern parts of the uh the

50
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.669
northern part of Mesopotamia. So Assyria in the east

51
00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.419
and Syria in the west. And then of course,

52
00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.300
it had earlier names as well. Um BEFORE Babylonia

53
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:54.050
and Assyria became the, the two halves of Mesopotamia,

54
00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.110
there was a region called Sumer in the South.

55
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.789
Um There was a region called Accad in the

56
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.869
center and Suma and Accad later became known as

57
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.779
Babylonia. So there are lots of names but, but

58
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.429
we sort of group them together as Mesopotamia.

59
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.919
And when we look back in history, we hear

60
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.080
many times when it comes to the big ancient

61
00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:22.029
civilizations, people talking about places like Egypt, Greece, Rome,

62
00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:26.119
China, some of the civilizations in, in Central and

63
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.020
South America. Why is it that Mesopotamia seems to

64
00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:34.320
have been neglected in the history a lot or

65
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.130
at least until recently.

66
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.570
Um It's had its moments. It's very interesting. There

67
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.520
was a phase in the 19 twenties where there

68
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.809
was a sort of um bad for all things

69
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.089
mesopotamian. But you're right today, if you look in

70
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.039
a museum bookstore or you look online for videos

71
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.009
documentaries, that kind of thing, you're right. There's a

72
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.750
lot about Greece and Rome. There's a lot about

73
00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.979
Egypt. It's probably less about ancient China. Unfortunately, it's

74
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.169
a fascinating region. Um But you're right for the

75
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:06.690
Mediterranean region, Mesopotamia just doesn't have the same public

76
00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.350
awareness. People are less aware of, of Mesopotamia. The

77
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.830
reason I'm not sure. Um I think partly it

78
00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.720
has to do with, when you think of Greece

79
00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.980
and Rome, they were never forgotten. Nobody ever forgot

80
00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:21.108
how to read Greek or Latin. So there was

81
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:24.640
a continuous tradition in the west of reading the

82
00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:27.890
Greek and Roman classics and of visiting, you know,

83
00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:33.029
the, the great cities and so forth. Egypt was

84
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:38.179
so dramatic with all of its huge stone monuments

85
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.140
that pyramids never were covered by sand. You know,

86
00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.929
they were always there. And I think that that

87
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.480
meant that Egypt was a point of fascination. Even

88
00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:50.390
before hieroglyphs could be read. There was a sense

89
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.220
that this was a very, very ancient and grand

90
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.350
civilization. Mesopotamia was still, it was known, it wasn't

91
00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.179
unknown, of course, because the Bible has records of

92
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.410
the Assyrians. And there were um, travelers throughout, I

93
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.070
think, ever ever since ancient times who were aware

94
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.459
that a great civilization had existed there. But it

95
00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:14.470
wasn't well known because aside from the Bible, very

96
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.600
little was known about the, about the culture and

97
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.429
the Bible only covered the very latest sort of

98
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.899
periods, like I say, very latest from the first

99
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.730
millennium onwards was sort of familiar BC was familiar

100
00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:29.350
from the Bible. And so it wasn't until archaeologists

101
00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:33.950
began excavating in the 19th century that the civilization

102
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.929
that was there became clear and interesting, but in

103
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.260
terms of what's actually there to visit, they built

104
00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:44.950
largely out of mud brick. And so there's nothing

105
00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.670
there like the Parthenon, there's nothing there like the

106
00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.579
pantheon in, in Rome or like the Great Pyramids,

107
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.869
tourists going to visit Iraq to see the ancient

108
00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:59.399
monuments. Um Unless they've been rebuilt and, and restored.

109
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.250
There's really not much to see and I think

110
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.940
that's part of it as well that the, the

111
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.589
drama of the great buildings of the other ancient

112
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.570
cultures are, are missing. And what's I, I think

113
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.690
is the most fascinating thing about Mesopotamian culture, which

114
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.119
is the hundreds of thousands of documents that survive

115
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.320
and that can be read scholars in the field,

116
00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.200
know about them, but it hasn't become particularly um

117
00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.609
familiar territory for general readers. They don't know that

118
00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:30.679
there's this vast amount of fascinating information that we

119
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.640
have and not just about the leaders but about

120
00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:38.000
everyday people who lived at the time and whose

121
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.910
contracts and letters and things like this survive. So

122
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.160
we have this really, really rich phenomenal amount of

123
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.440
information about mesopotamian culture, which I think people would

124
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.720
find fascinating if they knew about. But you're right

125
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.739
that there's, there's much less um that's been written

126
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.600
and discussed about it in the, in sort of

127
00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:57.390
public forums

128
00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:02.679
and also in mentioning other ancient civilizations. I mean,

129
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.529
in terms of the timeline that we're talking about

130
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.100
here, we usually talk about the civilizations that developed

131
00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:14.519
between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers and as

132
00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:19.359
the gravel of civilization. But were these really what

133
00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:23.380
we could call the first civilizations in the entire

134
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.339
world or not? You

135
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.010
know, there's a lot of stuff to unpack there.

136
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:32.880
One is the term civilization. Um And I, you're

137
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.739
right, I just used it but it is a

138
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.239
bit of a difficult uh difficult um term. Um

139
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.540
I think it's better to talk about urban culture

140
00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.570
because we can certainly view people who had lived

141
00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:48.369
before urban culture as having been civilized. You know.

142
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.010
And then there are the, well, what constitutes a

143
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:52.709
civilization? Do you have to have writing? Do you

144
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.940
have to have monumental architecture? There's a lot of

145
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.220
discussion about it and I think that that means

146
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.649
that it's, it's a tricky, it's a tricky term.

147
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.049
But if we talk about urban culture, big cities

148
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.950
and people living together in a situation where they,

149
00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.829
there are tens of thousands of people living in

150
00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:12.579
the same place that as far as we know,

151
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:16.500
the earliest city like that probably was the city

152
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.649
of Uruk in Mesopotamia. But we only have what's

153
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.850
been excavated and to say it's definitely the, the

154
00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:27.390
earliest I think would, although, yeah, it's, it's often

155
00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:29.910
described as the first, the more I think about

156
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.159
it and the more that I write about these

157
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.590
um these cultures, the more I suspect that there's

158
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.049
contemporary or, or Egypt, for example, was developing cities

159
00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:43.830
right around the same time. Um Who knows, they're

160
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.659
finding interesting things in China that we going earlier

161
00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.390
and earlier in Chinese culture in South Asia as

162
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.419
well. So I don't want to sort of put

163
00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:53.549
my neck out. Say yes, absolutely. The earliest city,

164
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.679
it was one of the earliest. Absolutely. And it's

165
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.159
one of the earliest that we know well, because

166
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.419
of the amount that has survived from the early

167
00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:03.229
cities there. Yeah.

168
00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:08.710
And what we now historically refer to as Mesopotamia

169
00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:13.599
and Mesopotamian civilization in terms of the timeline, when

170
00:09:13.609 --> 00:09:18.780
exactly do you place it start? And when did

171
00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:21.059
it come to end? Then uh

172
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.770
another very trick question. Um If we take it

173
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.739
with the beginnings of cities, I would say about

174
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.729
3500 BCE U have something that looks like a

175
00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:36.090
city with monumental architecture. Um Tens of thousands of

176
00:09:36.099 --> 00:09:39.299
people living in one place. And, but when it

177
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:43.260
ended, is really controversial because you could say it

178
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.469
ended with the arrival of Cyrus of Persia in

179
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:52.419
539 BCE because that was the end of local

180
00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:56.039
rule. That after Cyrus, the rulers who were ruling

181
00:09:56.049 --> 00:10:00.020
the region were not living in Mesopotamia. But the

182
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.469
culture didn't change almost at all. They continued to

183
00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:04.739
use ka for they continued to use the same

184
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.520
languages. The people living through Cyrus's arrival wouldn't fit

185
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.440
up. That's it. That's the end. So I don't

186
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.780
think that's right. And then other people will say,

187
00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:14.739
well, it was the arrival of Alexander the great

188
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.590
in um and, and sort of maybe they put

189
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:20.669
323 BCE as the end. But again, there's a

190
00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.969
lot of people who do studies of the ancient

191
00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:26.770
Middle East and Mesopotamia after Alexander the great all

192
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.969
the way up through the Parthian period, they were

193
00:10:28.979 --> 00:10:31.940
still using C form sometimes and there was still

194
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.830
some references to the ancient gods. So there's no

195
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.510
real uh you can sort of put a date

196
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.330
on it and say that that's the end, it

197
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.159
gradually faded away with the introduction of first Persian

198
00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:49.520
culture and later hellenistic Greek and Roman, that little

199
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.969
bits of the culture still existed. But the um

200
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.739
the influences of other uh other cultures that, that

201
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.429
were dominant in the region became more and more

202
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.619
prominent. And by about about the year one, almost

203
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.900
nobody could read can form anymore. So if you,

204
00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.679
if you think about the um the sort of

205
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.359
BCE ce uh break being approximately when, when we

206
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:14.940
can say it was pretty much gone.

207
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:19.049
And of course, as you mentioned earlier in the

208
00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:23.409
Bible, for example, we can find mentions to some

209
00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:28.780
of the kingdoms and empires in Ancient Mesopotamia. But

210
00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:33.849
when was it exactly that historians and archaeologists first

211
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:38.539
found out that there were actually ancient civilizations in

212
00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:41.239
the ancient, near east and perhaps a few of

213
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.640
them were still unknown. They, that

214
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.679
the, the site of ancient, like Nineveh Babylon, I

215
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.190
don't think they'd ever been forgotten. The people living

216
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.929
in the region knew that that was where those

217
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.690
cities were. And uh so travelers had visited them

218
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.250
like in the 16th century, 17th century from um

219
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.609
western travelers. But of course, within the Middle East,

220
00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:10.210
people had been very familiar with the region and

221
00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:13.349
the civilizations all along. I think the big turning

222
00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:17.320
point was when they started to excavate at the

223
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.489
sites formally um in the mid 19th century, uh

224
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.200
early, early, early to mid 19th century. And they

225
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.440
began to find real evidence, especially in the North

226
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.979
in the region of Assyria of these enormous palaces

227
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:35.409
and um relief sculptures. And at the beginning of

228
00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:37.799
this, the big interest was of course, with the

229
00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:42.239
connections to the Bible that when um excavators came

230
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.719
from France or Britain or um or the United

231
00:12:45.729 --> 00:12:49.239
States, they came as one of my professors said,

232
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.549
with the Bible in one hand and a and

233
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.919
a shovel in the other, they were looking for

234
00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:56.030
evidence for what was recorded in the Bible and

235
00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:58.989
they found it, they found the kings Sakib as

236
00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:00.479
I had. And these kings that are named in

237
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:03.030
the Bible were the kings who built those early

238
00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.750
palaces. And so there was a great deal of

239
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.179
interest at that time in these discoveries. And then

240
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.080
when can air form was deciphered again, enormous amount

241
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.979
of um of interest. But your question about when

242
00:13:15.989 --> 00:13:19.950
they found the civilizations that had been unknown until

243
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.650
uh until then, this was really when they started

244
00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:26.109
excavating in the South around um the beginning early

245
00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:31.000
19 hundreds, they were excavating in, for example, the

246
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.349
region of or and finding that there were levels

247
00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.270
long before the Assyrians, thousands of years before the

248
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.549
Assyrians. And that was a shock. This was a

249
00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:42.710
culture that had been completely forgotten. This is the

250
00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:45.590
culture of the Sumerians. And I think then there

251
00:13:45.599 --> 00:13:48.700
was a sense of the really deep and long

252
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.150
lasting culture that the Assyrians were quite late. The

253
00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:55.130
Neo Assyrian empire that's recorded in the Bible and

254
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.510
was contemporary with the um uh uh the, the

255
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.349
writers of the Bible. Um OBVIOUSLY, the Bible was

256
00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:04.289
written over a long period of time, but some

257
00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:06.530
of the writers of the Bible that was quite

258
00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:10.340
late in terms of, of Mesopotamian civilization. The Assyrians

259
00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:14.140
were building on a culture that had been almost

260
00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:19.159
3000 years previous to them had been thriving with

261
00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:21.719
the same gods and the same writing system and

262
00:14:21.729 --> 00:14:24.359
such continuity previous to the Assyrians

263
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:28.539
and talking about the writing system, at least as

264
00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:32.770
far as we know, Mesopotamia was probably the region

265
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:38.020
of the globe where written language was first developed.

266
00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:40.400
It was one of them, it depends how you

267
00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:44.330
define writing. Um There were certainly signs being used

268
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.729
in Egypt, uh written some sort of written signs

269
00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:50.369
around the same time. There are some claims that

270
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.690
there were some of uh a script in South

271
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.799
Asia was was early as well. But we know

272
00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:57.909
a lot about the Ka form writing system and

273
00:14:57.919 --> 00:14:59.780
it was one of the earliest, if not the

274
00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:03.950
earliest, but its very beginnings. It was not a

275
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.349
writing system really. It was a almost like a

276
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:12.270
memory aid because the very earliest signs were not

277
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.760
designed to represent spoken language. They were a way

278
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.909
of recording um administration. So there were signs for

279
00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:25.729
numbers and there were signs for nouns, um objects,

280
00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:30.609
cows, sheep, bushels of barley, um jugs of beer,

281
00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:33.859
that kind of thing. And the early texts are

282
00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:37.659
just those, they're just numbers and um and objects.

283
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:40.460
And so that's not really writing. If you think

284
00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:41.549
about it, it's not writing in the way that

285
00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:43.679
we think of it. It took a while for

286
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.789
that system to develop into a system where you

287
00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:50.729
could record spoken language where you could record verbs

288
00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:53.900
and names. And um and it, it took becoming

289
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.299
a syllabic script for that to develop.

290
00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:01.700
Uh Yeah. O originally, it was used mostly I,

291
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.200
I mean, whatever symbols they used, it was mostly

292
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:10.280
for um uh I mean, just a practical purposes,

293
00:16:10.289 --> 00:16:14.000
right? I mean, prac having to do with people,

294
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.729
what were people were doing in their daily lives

295
00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:19.724
and, and to be registered for them to keep

296
00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:22.284
a track of people's activities and so on. It

297
00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:27.525
was not exactly about writing poems and literature and

298
00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:30.085
all of that that came later, right? It

299
00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:33.075
did much later when and it wasn't so much

300
00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.054
people's daily lives. It was the palace and the

301
00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:38.195
temple that needed the writing system because from very

302
00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:40.484
early on and the earliest writing is from the

303
00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:42.034
city of U, which is, as I say, the

304
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:45.460
earliest city, the the writing system, which is around

305
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:48.750
3200 BCE or so when they first started using

306
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.919
it was all about the goods coming into the

307
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.729
temple, the goods coming out of the temple, into

308
00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:58.650
the warehouses, out of the warehouses, this, the lists

309
00:16:58.659 --> 00:17:00.799
and they have, um, total at the bottom and

310
00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:03.520
they, they're doing their arithmetic and adding everything up

311
00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:08.098
and then they began to use the signs as

312
00:17:08.108 --> 00:17:10.368
the sound of the word rather than just the

313
00:17:10.378 --> 00:17:13.698
word. So if you think about um, the word

314
00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:15.878
be like a, a buzzing bee, right? You could

315
00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.759
draw a, a bee and you would, you could

316
00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:19.779
use it for the sound be and they did

317
00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.229
did that. They began to do that for words

318
00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:26.588
that were very hard to draw. So um a

319
00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:30.068
classic example is that uh the, the word G

320
00:17:30.078 --> 00:17:33.499
in Sumerian meant read like a reed that grows

321
00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:35.558
on a riverbank, but it also meant the verb

322
00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:38.569
to return. So you could draw a read and

323
00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:40.689
read it as as to return. And that's a

324
00:17:40.699 --> 00:17:43.900
very useful word if you're doing administration so that

325
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.300
you begin to see the the use of the

326
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.030
of the sound of the word being used to

327
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.939
express uh words that are very hard to, to

328
00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:57.439
draw and then that then becomes eventually a system.

329
00:17:57.449 --> 00:18:01.589
And it was never fully um phonetic as a

330
00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:04.650
system. The Kar form writing system, some signs were

331
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.489
used for whole words, some signs were used for

332
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.560
sounds, uh always a syllable rather than a single

333
00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:12.780
consonant. So it would have been you know, consonant,

334
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.349
vowel, consonant or constant vowel or something like that.

335
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.099
And, and then the other thing that they could

336
00:18:18.109 --> 00:18:20.640
use the signs for were what we called determinative,

337
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.150
which was a sign that you didn't read aloud.

338
00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:25.410
But it told you what the next word was

339
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.239
going to be. So there was, for example, a

340
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.130
determinative if the word was something made out of

341
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.130
wood. So you had the word determinative and that

342
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.439
told you that the next sign was a wooden

343
00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:36.229
object or there was a determinative for a city.

344
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:37.819
And so it told you the next, actually, the

345
00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:40.310
preceding word was the name of a city. All

346
00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.079
of those kinds of, of ways of using can

347
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.959
form and made it a complicated system. But it

348
00:18:45.969 --> 00:18:48.050
was one that was very expressive by the time

349
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.880
it developed and could in fact properly represent language.

350
00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:55.459
So things like the epic, the epic of Gilgamesh

351
00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.780
were things that came much later in writing history,

352
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.319
right?

353
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.270
They did after it took several 100 years for

354
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.949
them to start thinking of using writing for something

355
00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:09.739
other than administration. And one of the first things

356
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.949
they used to it to record were um legal,

357
00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:18.119
legal contracts, um legal records of someone giving land

358
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.150
to someone else or selling land to someone else,

359
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.859
that kind of thing then, oh, I should mention

360
00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:24.729
that one thing that was written very early on

361
00:19:25.949 --> 00:19:29.030
at the same time as m administration were lists

362
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.829
of words called lexical texts. And this was because

363
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.680
scribes had to learn how to use the writing

364
00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:36.270
system to keep track of the administration. And so

365
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.479
they went to school and there's evidence of schools

366
00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:41.349
very early on. And at school, they would learn

367
00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:43.750
these lists of nouns or lists of verbs. And

368
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.229
so those are very early as well. But anything

369
00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:49.579
that looks like literature is indeed much later. The

370
00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:52.839
earliest would be probably king's royal inscriptions where the

371
00:19:52.849 --> 00:19:55.800
king claims to have conquered the neighbors or, you

372
00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.280
know, whatever those around maybe 2425 2500 BCE, you

373
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.380
get royal inscriptions. And only after that do they

374
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.140
start writing literary works? And interestingly when you find

375
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.640
literary works, they're almost always found in scribal schools

376
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.040
rather than that. It's, it's not something that people

377
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.250
would have in their house. You know, I have

378
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.760
a copy of the epic of Gilgamesh. It tended

379
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.030
to be when scribes were learning to write, they

380
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.890
learned to write these epics and poems and that's

381
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.839
where we find them is in um scribble exercises.

382
00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:31.010
Another very interesting thing that I got from reading

383
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.489
your books and watching some of your lectures is

384
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:41.140
how linguistically and ethnically diverse Mesopotamia was actually because

385
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.969
I mean, of course, again, going back to the

386
00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:47.180
fact that uh I mean, people commonly don't know

387
00:20:47.189 --> 00:20:51.369
much about Mesopotamia, they just might think that it

388
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.314
was just one single people or even if it

389
00:20:54.324 --> 00:20:57.675
was divided into different Kingdoms and then empires and

390
00:20:57.685 --> 00:21:01.844
so on. We were still talking about basically people

391
00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:05.035
with the same group, identity or something along those

392
00:21:05.045 --> 00:21:07.895
lines. But it was actually not, that was actually

393
00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.665
not the case. It

394
00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:12.625
wasn't. Yes. From the very earliest times, uh the

395
00:21:12.635 --> 00:21:16.160
Sumerian language which was spoken in the South is

396
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.239
a completely radically different from the Acadian language which

397
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.880
was spoken in the center in the north of,

398
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.089
of Mesopotamia. So different that they are completely different

399
00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:27.930
language families. And Sumerian is what's called an isolate

400
00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:30.540
in that it has no descendants. There is no

401
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.709
language, no modern language that has reliably been um

402
00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:39.910
uh identified as descending from Sumerian, whereas Acadian is

403
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.810
a Semitic language. And therefore, it is, it shares

404
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.030
a lot in common with modern Arabic, with modern

405
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.449
Hebrew, with Aramaic, with many Semitic languages that came

406
00:21:48.459 --> 00:21:53.079
in between. And so those are two apparently indigenous

407
00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:55.790
languages. Although there's some question as to what uh

408
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.579
when the Sumerians arrived, if they, where they came

409
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:03.760
from, if they came from somewhere. Um Those are

410
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.119
are are certainly though indigenous, the the Semitic and

411
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.189
the Sumerian languages, but then people moved in from

412
00:22:09.199 --> 00:22:13.130
outside at various times. So there are waves of

413
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.150
immigrants, Mesopotamia is not very well isolated. I mean,

414
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.175
Egypt, if you can think of Egypt, it's got

415
00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:20.944
these. Uh AND this is the classic thing everyone

416
00:22:20.954 --> 00:22:23.675
says about Egypt. There are barriers on all sides,

417
00:22:23.685 --> 00:22:26.214
there's desert, on two sides, there's the cataracts to

418
00:22:26.224 --> 00:22:28.025
the south and there's the Mediterranean Sea to the

419
00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:31.094
north. So there's not an easy way of getting

420
00:22:31.104 --> 00:22:34.170
into Egypt in large numbers. Other people did in

421
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.310
Mesopotamia, there's just open borders in many, in many

422
00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:40.810
directions. And so people came in from the highlands

423
00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:42.630
and they brought languages from the highlands, from the

424
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.359
Zagros Mountains, people moved in from the west and

425
00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:48.020
they would bring their languages from the west, there's

426
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.160
and from the north as well. So you have

427
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.339
this very um uh linguistically diverse population. And from

428
00:22:55.349 --> 00:22:57.750
the very earliest texts written, we can tell that

429
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.300
people were bilingual because you have, for example, texts

430
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.930
written in Sumerian and the scribe's name is Acadian.

431
00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:06.989
And so we know from his name that he

432
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.619
was an Acadian speaker, but he was writing all

433
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.109
of his, his works in Sumerian. That was standard.

434
00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:17.550
There was a lot of Sumerian Acadian bilingualism, but

435
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.729
then later Amorites came from the West and they

436
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:23.119
spoke a different form of Semitic language and they

437
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.209
too integrated into the culture. And so you have

438
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:28.209
families where even the children's names are in two

439
00:23:28.219 --> 00:23:31.280
different languages, which suggests that the family was bilingual,

440
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.819
that they have an Amor right name and an

441
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:36.930
Acadian name with among the Children. Um Then there's

442
00:23:36.939 --> 00:23:40.229
a group called the CASS sites who very frustratingly

443
00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:43.469
because uh they're fascinating the CASS sites, but they

444
00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:46.089
almost never wrote their own language down. They, they

445
00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:49.319
adopted Acadian when they arrived they kept CASS site

446
00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:52.420
names. There are a few Cassi terms. There's some,

447
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.859
but, but it's very hard to tell what language

448
00:23:54.869 --> 00:23:57.000
group CASS site might have been. And there's people

449
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.609
in the north of Syria who spoke a language

450
00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:01.140
called Huron, which was completely unrelated to the Semitic

451
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.910
languages or Sumerian. It's just a big mass of

452
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.109
languages and the people are in contact with one

453
00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:09.300
another throughout the eras. And so one thing that's

454
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.020
always fascinated me is the the role of translation

455
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.810
and of bilingualism and of um of this really

456
00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:21.140
rich contract contact and uh and interaction between the

457
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:21.719
cultures.

458
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.910
A and also, I mean, when it comes to

459
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.510
social relations, of course, people were in contact with

460
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.430
these other peoples that have other ethnic identities and

461
00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:39.520
spoke others at least slightly different languages. But it

462
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.650
was not uh I mean, in terms of uh

463
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:48.015
uh social cohesion that didn't have a very big

464
00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:52.964
impact. As for example, we unfortunately, unfortunately, nowadays would

465
00:24:52.974 --> 00:24:59.094
hear first from certain politicians that open borders policies

466
00:24:59.104 --> 00:25:01.214
are a disaster or something

467
00:25:01.224 --> 00:25:04.334
they had um they did, they did get along

468
00:25:04.344 --> 00:25:07.834
fine. Uh Most of the time, I think uh

469
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.729
there's a few sort of differences in terms of,

470
00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:14.010
of today. Of course, there's a lot of difference

471
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.369
and I should say the languages were not just

472
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.780
slightly different, completely different. The horn hit Acadian and

473
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.479
Sumerian were completely different language families. So unlike if

474
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:25.810
you think about the European languages most of which

475
00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:28.800
is are, are currently Indo European and so Spanish

476
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.160
Portuguese can sort of understand one another. HN hit

477
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.890
Sumerian and Acadian absolutely differently structured, different tense. Uh

478
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.430
YOU know, the the case endings, everything is completely

479
00:25:39.439 --> 00:25:41.880
different and yet they did find ways to communicate.

480
00:25:42.189 --> 00:25:45.599
One of the reasons for this openness was that

481
00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:50.300
Mesopotamia's natural resources were limited. They were very rich

482
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.819
in terms of the agricultural land. They were very

483
00:25:52.829 --> 00:25:55.180
rich in terms of um sheep. They had a

484
00:25:55.189 --> 00:25:56.819
lot of sheep and goats and so they could

485
00:25:56.829 --> 00:26:01.520
produce textiles, but things like mineral ores, stone, building,

486
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.640
um building stone wood for building, all of these

487
00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.729
had to come from somewhere else. And that meant

488
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:09.160
they were looking outwards from the very beginning, they

489
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.079
were in contact with regions they wanted to trade

490
00:26:11.089 --> 00:26:14.219
with. And so a lot of the early interactions

491
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.229
were not antagonistic. They seem to have been um

492
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.410
trade related and trying to get goods that were

493
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.449
needed in Mesopotamia and the Mesopotamians in turn trading

494
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:29.550
into other regions. There were times though when they

495
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.050
had antagonisms and at those times, for example, there

496
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.630
was a point at which the uh there was

497
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.869
a wall built to keep out the Amorites um

498
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.959
was completely ineffective. But it was uh the in

499
00:26:42.969 --> 00:26:44.589
the, in the time of the third dynasty of

500
00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:48.910
or around 2000 BCE or so, they were building,

501
00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:50.969
you know, there was a king who was very

502
00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:53.020
proud of having built this wall to keep the

503
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:58.479
Amorites out. So that suggests an antagonism that was

504
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.229
in a way somewhat fabricated because Emirates were already

505
00:27:03.239 --> 00:27:05.959
living in Mesopotamia and they were completely integrated into

506
00:27:05.969 --> 00:27:09.880
the society. But there was this perception at various

507
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.609
times that there was an enemy to be kept

508
00:27:11.619 --> 00:27:15.130
out. Um BUT that's not the majority of these

509
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.599
interactions. I think the majority of the interactions were

510
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.469
um much more peaceful and much more um trade

511
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:21.959
related.

512
00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:24.599
Mhm And of course, it's not to say that

513
00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:29.069
there's never, I mean, tensions between people that come

514
00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:33.920
from different cultural backgrounds. But also it's not necessarily

515
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.099
the case that just because they have to interact

516
00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:41.395
with one another society just uh falls into complete

517
00:27:41.405 --> 00:27:41.775
chaos.

518
00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:45.204
No. And a lot of the wars were not

519
00:27:45.214 --> 00:27:47.875
between people who have different ethnicities. A lot of

520
00:27:47.885 --> 00:27:49.704
the wars were between people who spoke the same

521
00:27:49.714 --> 00:27:52.875
languages. And so I don't think it was a

522
00:27:52.885 --> 00:27:57.194
dividing line. I think there's when they were first

523
00:27:57.204 --> 00:28:00.119
writing about the Sumerians and this is the early

524
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.170
20th century, there was a perception and you still

525
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.369
find this in textbooks that the Sumerians were attacked

526
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.810
from outside by the Acadians, by Sargon of Aca

527
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.270
who came in with different technology in a different

528
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.329
language and the Acadians conquered the Sumerians there. Yes,

529
00:28:15.339 --> 00:28:19.020
he was an Acadian speaker. Yes, absolutely. But it

530
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.069
was not perceived at that time at all as

531
00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:27.219
an invasion of foreigners coming into Suma. Um HE

532
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:31.459
did conquer parts of Suma and um and imposed

533
00:28:31.469 --> 00:28:35.069
his, his government there. But as I say, the

534
00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:36.930
Sumerians and Acadians had been in contact and been

535
00:28:36.939 --> 00:28:38.819
living right next to one another in the same

536
00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:41.589
cities forever. There'd been Sumerians living in Acadian cities

537
00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:44.109
and Acadians living in Acadian speakers living in Sumerian

538
00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:47.219
cities long before Sargon. So it wasn't sort of

539
00:28:47.229 --> 00:28:49.520
the arrival of these unknown outsiders. It was, it

540
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.130
was a, a power hungry king who wanted to

541
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.829
build an empire. But uh it wasn't a sort

542
00:28:54.839 --> 00:28:55.780
of ethnic conflict

543
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.839
and also something that you referred to briefly there.

544
00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:02.569
In one of my previous questions was uh the

545
00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:06.219
fact that there were also trade relations. And so

546
00:29:06.229 --> 00:29:10.199
merchants also played an important role when it came

547
00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:14.209
to the social dynamics, let's say, and the way

548
00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:17.910
that people, different peoples related to one another.

549
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:23.010
Yes. Yes, they're fascinating. The merchants really interesting. Um

550
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.270
The uh one of the books that I wrote

551
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.180
a few years ago called Brotherhood of Kings. A

552
00:29:27.189 --> 00:29:29.689
big section of it is about trade. It's also

553
00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:33.500
about diplomacy. But, but the trade is really interesting

554
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.160
because you have trade connections as early as 2300

555
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.530
BC, all the way to the Indus Valley, all

556
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.949
the way to um they were trading with what

557
00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:44.939
is now Bahrain, they were trading with what is

558
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:48.300
now Oman. And they were, these were regular merchants

559
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.020
going back and forth between these regions by boat

560
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.079
over hundreds of miles. And then later in the

561
00:29:54.089 --> 00:29:57.910
19th to the 18th centuries, especially BCE, there were

562
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.650
traders from Mesopotamia, trading all the way into what

563
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.349
is now Turkey. And um again, hundreds of miles,

564
00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:08.109
this time overland, taking goods in both directions, living

565
00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:11.800
peacefully with the people in those regions, setting up

566
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.060
um what are called colonies, although it's not really

567
00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:18.160
the right term uh trading colonies where they would

568
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.439
live within a city in a sort of community

569
00:30:20.449 --> 00:30:23.750
of Assyrians living in this community. And this is

570
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.130
long before Syria was a imperialistic power. This is

571
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.709
a very small town really called Assyria that had

572
00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:34.050
traders. Um There was uh there was trade over,

573
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.119
over land that came all the way from what

574
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.349
is now Afghanistan bringing Lapis Lazily, just an enormous

575
00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:44.920
amount of movement of goods at a time when

576
00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:47.160
I think it's people think of the Silk Road

577
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.800
as being the founder of this. But this was

578
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.880
long before the Silk Road and yet those same

579
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.680
routes were being used so much earlier to bring

580
00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:55.800
many of the same goods in each direction.

581
00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.760
So let's focus now a little bit on the

582
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.589
second millennium BC, which is a period that you

583
00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:07.660
focused some of your work on and the early

584
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:13.420
old Babylonian period and Hammurabi's reign. So um wh

585
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:18.319
who was Hammurabi actually at what would you say

586
00:31:18.329 --> 00:31:23.140
characterized this reign particularly when it came to war

587
00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.760
and diplomacy between states?

588
00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:29.430
Yes, Hammurabi was the king of Babylon, he came

589
00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:33.369
to power in 1792 using the traditional um chronology,

590
00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:37.660
1792 BC. And he was initially not an important

591
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.199
king. Uh His, it was a time when there

592
00:31:40.209 --> 00:31:43.489
were a number of kingdoms in Mesopotamia, sort of

593
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.420
territorial states that were um centered on a particular

594
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.250
capital city. And there was a very powerful king

595
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.219
in the north of Mesopotamia, whose name was Shamshi

596
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.949
ADAD, who ruled a large area of what is

597
00:31:55.959 --> 00:31:58.910
now Syria and northern Iraq. Um There was a

598
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.069
king in the south named Rim Sin who ruled

599
00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:04.050
a very major kingdom called Larsa. And there was

600
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.109
a king also in the region of Elam, which

601
00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:09.390
is now um uh Iran and Ham Rai was

602
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.790
just one of these kings. There were a number

603
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.380
of other ones as well over the course of

604
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.630
his reign. He had a very long reign. He

605
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.849
ruled for 43 years and for the 1st 30

606
00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.599
years of his reign, he was not a big

607
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:24.579
important person um in terms of the the regional

608
00:32:24.589 --> 00:32:30.310
dynamics, but uh he became more militaristic actually when

609
00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:33.160
there was an attack from Elam on the region

610
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.619
of uh his region and also the region known

611
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.130
as Esa. And then there were various alliances formed.

612
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.160
And again, when you talk about diplomacy, his diplomacy

613
00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.550
at this point was more to create a united

614
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.439
front against Elam. So there was diplomatic engagement among

615
00:32:52.449 --> 00:32:56.040
the the states in Mesopotamia, including a state called

616
00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:00.300
Mai, which was in the north. And these they

617
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.189
united, they were able to, to fight off the

618
00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:06.640
elites. And something happened abe around them where he

619
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.680
became, instead of someone who was just defending his

620
00:33:09.689 --> 00:33:11.969
kingdom, he seems to have turned around and become

621
00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:15.819
much more interested in conquering himself and, and conquering

622
00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:18.079
the neighbors. So he himself becomes a conqueror who

623
00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:21.079
instead of now working with these allies that he'd

624
00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:23.390
had, he turned against them. So he turned against

625
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.040
Larsa. The king of Larsa. Rim Sin was very

626
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.829
elderly. He ruled for about 60 years and his

627
00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:32.699
kingdom was conquered and then Hammurabi turns around and

628
00:33:32.709 --> 00:33:34.469
he he fights to the north and he managed

629
00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.729
also to take over the region of Mai, which

630
00:33:36.739 --> 00:33:39.069
had been one of his allies previously. So that

631
00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:41.359
by the time he died, he had an empire

632
00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:46.270
that extended from the Gulf up to what is

633
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.719
approximately the border of Syria today with, with Iraq

634
00:33:49.729 --> 00:33:51.869
a little bit beyond. And it was a big

635
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.280
kingdom. It was an empire. We call it an

636
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.469
empire because it's traditionally called Hammurabi's empire. But there

637
00:33:57.479 --> 00:33:59.099
are scholars who would argue it wasn't really an

638
00:33:59.109 --> 00:34:01.560
empire, but it was a big kingdom and he

639
00:34:01.569 --> 00:34:03.239
had conquered it and he had brought it under

640
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:07.569
his control. And he seems to have been pretty

641
00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:11.080
successful at ruling such a big region during his

642
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.039
reign as soon as he died. And his son

643
00:34:14.049 --> 00:34:18.628
took over Samso Luna in 1750 1749. Um Samso

644
00:34:18.779 --> 00:34:20.858
Luna was much less successful at maintaining the southern

645
00:34:20.868 --> 00:34:22.668
part so that he lost the southern part of

646
00:34:22.678 --> 00:34:25.039
the empire. He does though seem to have extended

647
00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:29.000
it somewhat further to the north. Um This, this

648
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.810
uh what's called the first dynasty of Babylon Hammurabi

649
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.800
founded it and it had collapsed by 1595. So

650
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.350
about 200 years of is considered the the first

651
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.639
dynasty of, of Babylon.

652
00:34:41.398 --> 00:34:44.539
So on the question of Babylon having been an

653
00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.849
empire, I would like to ask you here a

654
00:34:46.858 --> 00:34:51.839
broader question. So as an historian, what would be

655
00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:55.697
your reply to a question? Like what is an

656
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:59.418
empire? I mean, what is an empire actually?

657
00:34:59.638 --> 00:35:03.158
Yes, an empire. If you think about it being

658
00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:09.449
um uh a state that is multi, it, it

659
00:35:09.459 --> 00:35:11.669
it would consist of more than one nation, of

660
00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:13.389
course, at this point, they're not really thinking of

661
00:35:13.399 --> 00:35:15.479
nations. But if you think of a, of a,

662
00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:17.810
of a group of people who identify through a

663
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:23.199
shared language, maybe through a shared culture, an empire

664
00:35:23.209 --> 00:35:25.669
tends to include a number of different groups like

665
00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:29.949
that, who are Multilingual and who previously were independent

666
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.209
and they are being ruled by a single um

667
00:35:33.439 --> 00:35:36.649
government that is, is not uh local to their

668
00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:39.979
region. And in that way, I think Hammurabi is

669
00:35:39.989 --> 00:35:42.870
an empire in that he was certainly ruling over

670
00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:45.540
people who had previously been independent and who spoke

671
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:49.669
languages other than Acadian um but there's lots of,

672
00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:51.469
I mean, there's so much discussion about what constitutes

673
00:35:51.479 --> 00:35:54.409
an empire and especially when you look at modern

674
00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:58.040
history and, and there are scholars who will say

675
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.800
the first real empire was the Neo Assyrian empire,

676
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.860
which was indeed a mesopotamian empire, but it wasn't

677
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.040
founded until the 10th century BC. Um And even,

678
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.540
and some would say later than the 10th, late

679
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.909
10th, 8 8th century BC when kings developed the

680
00:36:14.919 --> 00:36:18.050
whole mechanism for maintaining an empire, because it's one

681
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.149
thing to conquer it. But then it's another thing

682
00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:22.850
to have this uh the roads that you need

683
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.620
to build the garrisons, you need to set up

684
00:36:24.629 --> 00:36:26.979
the standing army in order to maintain it, the

685
00:36:26.989 --> 00:36:30.419
regular system of, of taxes, the regular system of

686
00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:34.419
um getting messages across the empire easily. That structure

687
00:36:34.429 --> 00:36:37.050
didn't develop in Hammurabi's time. So if, if that's

688
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.979
the definition of an empire, then his wouldn't be

689
00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:43.010
an empire and having provinces and so forth, you

690
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.840
know, provinces and governors, all of those sorts of

691
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.050
things that developed with empire.

692
00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:48.840
And of course, I ask you that question, not

693
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.399
because I want a, a definitive answer to it,

694
00:36:52.409 --> 00:36:55.469
but I uh because it is a very interesting

695
00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:59.320
and intellectually stimulating question also because I mean, uh

696
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.679
you can, you might say that what we mean

697
00:37:02.689 --> 00:37:06.479
by an empire, a nation, a kingdom, a country,

698
00:37:06.489 --> 00:37:08.530
I mean, these are at the end of the

699
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.919
day, I guess, useful constructs that historians, archaeologists and

700
00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:15.800
other kinds of people use, but they are just

701
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.195
constructs, they are what they are. But uh also,

702
00:37:19.205 --> 00:37:23.625
I mean, uh what we understand by them is

703
00:37:23.665 --> 00:37:28.064
sometimes might have implications for people's lives. Like, for

704
00:37:28.074 --> 00:37:32.715
example, the more recent uh concept of nations that

705
00:37:32.725 --> 00:37:37.649
we've had since the 18th 19th century, right, which

706
00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:40.389
was, which is a new concept of nation that

707
00:37:40.399 --> 00:37:44.969
didn't exist, it didn't exist previously in history. So,

708
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.550
I mean, there, there's also always these uh very

709
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.320
interesting questions and I'm not sure to what extent

710
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.580
you agree with me. When I say that perhaps

711
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.469
they are useful constructs. At the end of the

712
00:37:56.479 --> 00:37:59.350
day, there are constructs, but still they might have

713
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.909
some implications as to how people relate to one

714
00:38:02.919 --> 00:38:04.270
another and so on.

715
00:38:04.899 --> 00:38:08.360
I agree, I think they are um I think

716
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.300
one very interesting thing to look at is how

717
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.959
the ancients define things themselves. And of course, they

718
00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:17.760
didn't have a word for empire. Uh They the

719
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.550
first king to think of having an empire was

720
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.959
Sargon who I mentioned before, Saron Aha. And well,

721
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:25.550
actually he's not the first one to think of

722
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.489
it. There was a king before him called Luke

723
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.070
Alag, who came up with the idea but didn't

724
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.889
actually manage to build an empire. But the idea

725
00:38:32.899 --> 00:38:34.520
of being king of the whole world, that was

726
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.110
his sort of goal. I want to be king

727
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.270
of the whole world. I'm going to rule from

728
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.080
the lower sea to the upper sea. And that's

729
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.399
from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. Now, look, Azeez,

730
00:38:42.409 --> 00:38:45.360
he didn't manage it at all. But Sargon who

731
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:49.810
came after him did apparently manage to conquer the

732
00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.709
region from the Gulf, maybe to the Mediterranean, probably

733
00:38:53.719 --> 00:38:57.469
not. But he, he, he tried very hard to

734
00:38:57.479 --> 00:38:59.709
conquer the world as he saw it. So he,

735
00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:03.379
he's creating the idea of a single person being

736
00:39:03.389 --> 00:39:06.330
in charge of everything, which is an insane idea.

737
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.550
If you think about it, I mean, just before

738
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.409
this, you'd had kings of little city states and,

739
00:39:11.419 --> 00:39:14.399
and maybe leagues of city states. But this, I

740
00:39:14.409 --> 00:39:17.239
am going to rule the world becomes something that

741
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.689
then becomes an idea that later kings have as

742
00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:24.750
an aspiration because they remember Sargon, he wasn't forgotten.

743
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.270
And so Hammurabi clearly must have had Sargon in

744
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.429
the back of his head. I want to do

745
00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:31.469
Sargon, I want, I want to conquer from the

746
00:39:31.479 --> 00:39:32.689
lower seat to the upper seat. I want to

747
00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:35.770
rule the world. And again, later with the Assyrians.

748
00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.699
And after that, once you have a tradition of

749
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:40.429
empire, it doesn't ever go away. Once you have

750
00:39:40.439 --> 00:39:46.560
that um um crazy sort of thought the Assyrians,

751
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.550
then the Neo Babylonians and then the Aids and,

752
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.000
and the hellenistic Greeks and on and on and

753
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.409
on this, this idea that one could, that one

754
00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:57.879
man could rule the world and it does tend

755
00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:00.969
to focus on an emperor. It tends to be

756
00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:03.100
an imperial project that has a person at the

757
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.669
top. Um And then you think about so their

758
00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:09.399
perception was not, I'm going to build an empire

759
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:11.090
because they didn't have the word empire. It was,

760
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.830
I'm going to rule the world, you know, which

761
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.489
is even crazier. But I think that these using

762
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.209
their, their conceptions of things and then comparing them

763
00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:23.239
with what we do, um as historians is useful,

764
00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.969
not just in terms of empire. I find it

765
00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:27.689
very interesting in terms of religion too, which is

766
00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:30.790
a topic that is completely separate, but they had

767
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.540
no word for religion. And when we try to

768
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.000
put their religion into a modern box, it just

769
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.729
doesn't work. It is just, and there are some

770
00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:40.469
people who would say we shouldn't use the word

771
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:45.389
religion for what the mesopotamians practiced because it didn't

772
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.629
have a holy book. It didn't, wasn't dogmatic. It

773
00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:49.290
didn't have, I mean, there were so many things

774
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.580
that we think of as part of religion that

775
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.840
we're not part of their religion did, didn't have

776
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.600
a claim on truth. There was no sort of,

777
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.060
we have the true religion and you have a

778
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.189
false religion. All of that is different. And so

779
00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:02.070
I think by looking at it through their eyes,

780
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.959
sometimes it gives us insights that we don't get

781
00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:07.590
if we try and categorize it using our own

782
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.570
terms. Do you see?

783
00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:12.239
No, that, that's very interesting. And actually I've already

784
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.889
talked on the show with people. I, I don't

785
00:41:14.899 --> 00:41:18.510
know if, if they would identify necessarily as historians,

786
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.479
but they did the historical work and they would

787
00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:27.479
be people that you would probably classify as postmodernists

788
00:41:27.489 --> 00:41:30.014
in terms of their way of approaching things. And

789
00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:34.854
for example, when it came to Ancient Greece, uh

790
00:41:34.864 --> 00:41:39.054
one of those people told me that, for example,

791
00:41:39.064 --> 00:41:43.074
we now talk about the economy, but the Greek

792
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:46.185
didn't have a concept like the economy and many

793
00:41:46.195 --> 00:41:49.405
other concepts that we now use nowadays that, that

794
00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:53.125
we use nowadays, they wouldn't happen. So perhaps even,

795
00:41:53.399 --> 00:41:57.260
even though it might be a little bit postmodernist,

796
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.979
it would still be true that when looking back

797
00:41:59.989 --> 00:42:05.659
in history across different civilizations, kingdoms, empires, where we

798
00:42:05.669 --> 00:42:08.739
have to keep in mind that probably many of

799
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:12.100
our modern concepts wouldn't apply to them and would

800
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.729
pro we should probably uh analyze their life, ways,

801
00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:20.899
their institutions and so on with that in mind.

802
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.909
I think that's right. And I think that I

803
00:42:23.919 --> 00:42:27.600
think theories are fascinating, you know, trying to decide

804
00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.229
who is in a chiefdom and who is in

805
00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:31.219
a kingdom and these sorts of things. It's fascinating

806
00:42:31.229 --> 00:42:34.949
work. But I don't think it necessarily is always

807
00:42:34.959 --> 00:42:39.449
true to the culture you're studying because perhaps they

808
00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.070
developed in a different way from the way that

809
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.020
the theorists have developed, looking at other cultures. And

810
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.040
so I think having an open mind about it

811
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.810
and not necessarily always wanting to um feel like,

812
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.580
OK, we've defined this as an empire and therefore

813
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.629
now we can move on. I think that there's,

814
00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:58.060
there's a real strength and importance in scholarship to

815
00:42:58.419 --> 00:43:01.850
uh being aware that our own contracts, as you

816
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.379
say are constructs and that they are not necessarily

817
00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:07.229
written in stone and, and don't always um appear

818
00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:08.969
as one might expect in a culture that you're

819
00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:09.409
studying.

820
00:43:10.229 --> 00:43:13.409
So another very interesting thing about the reign of

821
00:43:13.669 --> 00:43:17.949
Amur Abi was his code. I mean, the the

822
00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:21.679
still of Amur Abi, I is very well known.

823
00:43:21.689 --> 00:43:26.350
I mean, I I actually studied dentistry in university

824
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.659
and even in dentistry, I have a course on

825
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.100
the history of medicine and dental medicine and the

826
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.709
code of Abu Dhabi was mentioned there. So, so

827
00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:39.530
apparently everything was there.

828
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.449
Yeah. No, he, he has dentists in there is

829
00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:46.229
true. Removing teeth. Yeah, that's true. Oh His, his

830
00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:49.300
uh laws are fascinating. They, they were not the

831
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.310
first laws. He was certainly not the first law

832
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.090
giver. Uh THE hundreds of years before this kings

833
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.290
had promulgated their laws. Hammurabi by putting his on

834
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.149
a big stone Steele, as you say, in fact,

835
00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:01.899
a number of big stone Steelers, but only one

836
00:44:01.909 --> 00:44:03.750
of them has been found. We know there were

837
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.939
others and when that was found in 1902, it

838
00:44:08.949 --> 00:44:11.229
was found not in Babylon, it was found in

839
00:44:11.239 --> 00:44:13.850
Sousa where it had been captured by an earlier

840
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.629
king and taken as, as spoils of war and

841
00:44:17.639 --> 00:44:19.899
so it was found in Souza and it's so

842
00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:22.939
dramatic. It's, it's now in the Louver Museum and

843
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.540
you, it's 7 ft tall and it's a beautiful

844
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.939
diorite sculpture with um the sculpture of Hammurabi at

845
00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:31.489
the top and then all the laws on the,

846
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.139
on the lower part of it. And it's a

847
00:44:33.149 --> 00:44:37.679
really important historical document because it's so complete. It's

848
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:41.370
so um um fascinating in terms of what it

849
00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:43.909
tells us about the culture. What's interesting is it's

850
00:44:43.919 --> 00:44:45.419
not what most people think it is. It's not

851
00:44:45.429 --> 00:44:48.659
the first laws that was long before. Um It's

852
00:44:48.669 --> 00:44:53.949
the best preserved early law collection. Absolutely. Uh But

853
00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:58.969
Hammurabi was not inventing law and interestingly, even though

854
00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:00.959
the laws were put out in a public place,

855
00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:02.739
they had them set up in the city where

856
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.540
people could see them, most people were not literate.

857
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.860
A vast majority of people were not literate.

858
00:45:08.459 --> 00:45:10.709
I was going to ask you that if just

859
00:45:10.719 --> 00:45:13.199
common people could read it or

860
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.590
by Hammurabi's time, there was more literacy than there

861
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.570
had been previously, but it still wasn't common that

862
00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.209
the average person wouldn't be able to read and

863
00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:29.000
write. And um so they were up there and

864
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.290
they were also written in a very archaic script.

865
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.360
It's as though uh we were to put up

866
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.159
a, a monument today and use it in the

867
00:45:36.169 --> 00:45:38.570
script of the Gutenberg Bible. Most people wouldn't be

868
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.280
able to read it even if they could read

869
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.639
you know. And so he put it in this

870
00:45:42.649 --> 00:45:47.939
archaic script and it's one would have thought that

871
00:45:47.949 --> 00:45:50.879
judges would consult the laws in order to come

872
00:45:50.889 --> 00:45:53.760
up with their judgments. But curiously, there's no evidence

873
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.320
that they did. So, even though these laws existed,

874
00:45:56.469 --> 00:45:59.310
the legal system, which had also existed for hundreds

875
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.030
and hundreds of years, seems to have worked fairly

876
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.139
independently of the laws in that the, the, the

877
00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:07.260
judges clearly had a sense of what was right

878
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:10.679
or wrong. They made decisions that are similar to

879
00:46:10.689 --> 00:46:14.020
what's in the, the code, but doesn't follow it

880
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.489
to the letter. And they seem to have been

881
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.659
viewed much more as a set of legal precedents

882
00:46:18.669 --> 00:46:21.270
that the judges might have consulted sometimes and sometimes

883
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:25.000
they didn't and they probably were indeed legal precedents

884
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:26.739
that Hammurabi didn't sort of pull them out of,

885
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.459
out of, um, out of his head that they

886
00:46:29.469 --> 00:46:32.219
were examples of court cases that had happened, that

887
00:46:32.229 --> 00:46:36.659
decisions had been made. And these, um, these legal

888
00:46:36.669 --> 00:46:38.860
precedents he then collected and put it up in,

889
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.110
in a public place and most of them aren't

890
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.389
about crime at all. Most of them are about

891
00:46:43.399 --> 00:46:47.689
things like divorce and inheritance and property ownership and

892
00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:51.840
maintaining your fields and paying your taxes and, um,

893
00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:54.209
what things should cost and, and as you say,

894
00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:56.540
dentistry, you know, how much should a, should a

895
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.010
physician charge for taking out a tooth or whatever?

896
00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:01.260
That's the kind of thing that the laws are

897
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.290
so important for, because they tell us so much

898
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.790
about daily life about what people cared about and

899
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.370
what, what happened in the society.

900
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.320
So talking a little bit more about daily life

901
00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.850
and before we get into the Kingdom of Hannah,

902
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.350
uh we have this very common idea that the

903
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.310
ancient world was terribly violent. I mean, it was,

904
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.100
there was violence on the street every day, every

905
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:29.000
time. Um, BUT what do we actually know about

906
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.830
the prevalence of violence in mesopotamian society? I mean,

907
00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.149
was violence commonplace or was society mostly peaceful?

908
00:47:39.239 --> 00:47:41.389
Yeah, this is always a surprise for my students

909
00:47:41.399 --> 00:47:43.870
that they assumed that it was a long time

910
00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:46.229
ago. So it must have been very violent and

911
00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:49.719
it really wasn't the average person living their life

912
00:47:49.729 --> 00:47:53.419
in a city didn't encounter violence unless they were

913
00:47:53.429 --> 00:47:57.350
called up to go to war. Really. Um, THE,

914
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.709
there wasn't much random violence that we see and

915
00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:02.770
we know this because court cases survive. So there

916
00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.389
are court records and there are the laws as

917
00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:08.080
well, but there are certainly laws, you know, if

918
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.909
a man hits another man, that kind of thing.

919
00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:13.370
And so people did hit one another but, uh,

920
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:17.159
the extent to which this was a prevailing problem

921
00:48:17.169 --> 00:48:19.739
in a city seems to have been really small

922
00:48:19.939 --> 00:48:22.610
that people lived in communities within the city that

923
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.449
were generally full of neighbors who they were related

924
00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:28.989
to either by marriage or by, um, by birth.

925
00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:31.370
That people tended to live in the same house

926
00:48:31.379 --> 00:48:35.360
for generations. You knew all your neighbors, there was,

927
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.350
um, people had professions, they owned farms that were

928
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.280
outside in the fields, beyond the city. Their lives

929
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:46.129
were remarkably peaceful. For the most part, if a

930
00:48:46.139 --> 00:48:49.770
city was attacked, which happened periodically, I think one

931
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.209
gets the sense because we tend to compress 3000

932
00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:55.120
years of history into one chapter. Sounds though they're

933
00:48:55.129 --> 00:48:56.610
at war all the time, but they weren't, they

934
00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.780
really weren't. If, if your city was besieged. Yes,

935
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.590
you had difficulties, obviously, because you um had to

936
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.449
survive without you try what we surviving on the

937
00:49:06.459 --> 00:49:08.330
food and water that was available in the city,

938
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.629
that sort of thing. But even then when the

939
00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.090
city was conquered, at least in the second millennium,

940
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.040
it became much more violent in the first millennium,

941
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.050
I think. But in the second millennium, BC, there's

942
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.669
not much evidence of, of kings coming in and

943
00:49:20.679 --> 00:49:23.370
having their troops kill everyone in sight. That wasn't

944
00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:27.070
the case. They, they, nobody benefited from that. And

945
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.699
weirdly even on the battlefield, there is plenty of

946
00:49:30.709 --> 00:49:34.419
evidence that soldiers were more valuable if they were

947
00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:37.300
caught alive and held for ransom than if they

948
00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:39.979
were killed. So there are some of the laws

949
00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:42.639
in of Hammurabi, in fact refer to this situation,

950
00:49:42.649 --> 00:49:44.399
if a soldier has then gone on campaign and

951
00:49:44.409 --> 00:49:46.379
he's been taken captive and he's held for ransom.

952
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.659
There's a whole bunch of laws about how the,

953
00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:50.620
how his ransom is going to be paid, his

954
00:49:50.629 --> 00:49:52.800
family will pay it, family can't afford it. Then

955
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.770
his, um uh you know, the, the various stages

956
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.689
of first the temple and then perhaps even the

957
00:49:57.699 --> 00:50:01.250
king would pay his ransom. But the assumption was

958
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.010
that he would be ransomed and therefore the people

959
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.449
who've taken him captive, I mean, they stand to

960
00:50:06.459 --> 00:50:10.000
benefit, right? So, although there are records of a

961
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.300
lot of people dying in wars and the kings

962
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.050
brag about how many um burial mounds that they

963
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.060
had to, to build for the dead of the

964
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.469
enemy or whatever when it comes down to it,

965
00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:23.409
it really does seem as though the extent to

966
00:50:23.419 --> 00:50:26.870
which violence intruded on people's lives was relatively limited

967
00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.320
and that when it did happen, it was, it

968
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.679
was dramatic and, and feared, obviously,

969
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.050
I would imagine that when it comes to this

970
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.979
type of question, something that people do not usually

971
00:50:40.989 --> 00:50:45.270
consider is the fact that even if people by

972
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.949
then were already living in, what by their standards

973
00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:54.310
were big cities with thousands of people, not no

974
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.939
longer the 150 people in the hunter gatherer societies

975
00:50:58.949 --> 00:51:01.939
or something like that, the people in their own

976
00:51:01.949 --> 00:51:06.679
families and their immediate communities, they can more or

977
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:11.399
less regulate the behavior of the members of their

978
00:51:11.409 --> 00:51:14.320
communities. Right? I mean, it's not because perhaps they

979
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:18.560
didn't have the police back then that it's all

980
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.100
just a chaos, a chaos. All the time. Right.

981
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:22.290
Yeah.

982
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.830
No, it wasn't a chaos all the time at

983
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.120
all. And I do think there was a lot

984
00:51:25.129 --> 00:51:28.580
of social pressure to follow the norms of behavior

985
00:51:28.679 --> 00:51:31.250
and they were pretty strict in terms of how

986
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.770
you behaved and what was expected. And so when

987
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:39.429
people went to court, um, for example, if classic

988
00:51:39.439 --> 00:51:43.149
court case, um, uh, a woman died without having

989
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:46.090
Children and her dowry is supposed to revert to

990
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.709
her, her husband, not her husband, supposed to revert

991
00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:50.989
to her father or to her brothers because it

992
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.270
doesn't belong to her husband. This kind of thing

993
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.340
where you could imagine them getting into fights or

994
00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:57.750
so forth. They always went to court. They were

995
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.360
very, very, um interested in the judicial process and

996
00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.070
they wanted it to work. And it does seem

997
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.790
as though people rarely took things into their own

998
00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.590
hands, they would go to court. There were judges,

999
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.810
there were witnesses and very importantly, there was an

1000
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.610
oath that you had to swear. And this, I

1001
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.459
think is really a crucial part. And again, it

1002
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:21.260
goes back to their religion, you were asked to

1003
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.399
swear an oath in front of the image of

1004
00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:25.989
the God or the symbol of the God that

1005
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.179
you were telling the truth. So for example, if

1006
00:52:28.189 --> 00:52:31.360
in this hypothetical case where the, the brothers want

1007
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.790
to get back the, the land from the, the

1008
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.629
husband, um, they will go and swear an oath

1009
00:52:36.639 --> 00:52:39.870
that indeed they remember that their, their sister got

1010
00:52:39.879 --> 00:52:41.750
the dowry from her father and that they were

1011
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.909
there and that the dowry was hers and therefore

1012
00:52:43.919 --> 00:52:46.270
it should revert to them. And if they swore

1013
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.040
that in front of the gods, that was a

1014
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:51.679
deciding factor because they so deeply believed in the

1015
00:52:51.689 --> 00:52:54.360
gods that someone being willing to swear an oath

1016
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.179
was considered to be evidence that they were telling

1017
00:52:57.189 --> 00:52:59.870
the truth. And there's evidence that people were so

1018
00:52:59.879 --> 00:53:02.600
unwilling to, to lie in front of the gods

1019
00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.760
that there were decisions made on that basis as

1020
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:08.060
well. If someone says, um this man stole from

1021
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.790
me and they said, well, go and swear to

1022
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.120
the gods that this is stolen, they would often

1023
00:53:12.129 --> 00:53:13.929
go actually, no, I'm not going to swear that

1024
00:53:13.939 --> 00:53:16.310
oath. And then it was decided that clearly that,

1025
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.739
that the goods hadn't been stolen because he the,

1026
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.189
the person making the claim wasn't willing to swear.

1027
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.159
So for those reasons, and I think also because

1028
00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:27.500
of this sense that the gods were watching, especially

1029
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:31.320
the God Shamash and they wanted to not to

1030
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.399
be punished by Shamash. But there was a, there

1031
00:53:34.409 --> 00:53:38.290
was a surprisingly law-abiding feel to the cities that

1032
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.350
um in a sense that you were, you don't

1033
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.370
want to let down your family and your um

1034
00:53:45.729 --> 00:53:49.159
your household by doing something that would be uh

1035
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:50.719
violent or illegal.

1036
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.800
So another thing about Mesopotamian society, I would like

1037
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:58.810
to ask you is uh I'm I'm very interested

1038
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.790
in always when I talk with historians, for example,

1039
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:07.129
about hearing about uh gender relations and things related

1040
00:54:07.139 --> 00:54:09.909
to that. So, what was the role of men

1041
00:54:09.919 --> 00:54:16.639
in Mesopotamia? Was Mesopotamian civilization, patriarchal. And even if

1042
00:54:16.649 --> 00:54:21.320
it was patriarchal, what were women allowed to do?

1043
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.100
I mean, I, I'm not sure if at this

1044
00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:26.699
point we can talk about rights because they wouldn't

1045
00:54:26.729 --> 00:54:30.580
have had that concept probably as, at least as

1046
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:34.209
we understand it today. But, um, what do we

1047
00:54:34.219 --> 00:54:34.979
know about that?

1048
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.820
Oh, so much. And I'm so glad you asked.

1049
00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:41.810
Yes, it was a patriarchal society. Absolutely. Um, MEN

1050
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.409
were the head of the household but women had

1051
00:54:45.419 --> 00:54:49.969
enormous amount of agency to use a, a sort

1052
00:54:49.979 --> 00:54:53.459
of term that we use today. There were women

1053
00:54:53.469 --> 00:54:56.780
in all sorts of different professions. There were women

1054
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:01.149
who had leadership roles, women were allowed to take

1055
00:55:01.159 --> 00:55:03.750
someone to court. They could be witnesses in court,

1056
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:07.870
they could give loans to other people. They could,

1057
00:55:07.879 --> 00:55:10.889
um, go to court to get the loan repaid.

1058
00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.070
Um, THEY owned their own property that was given

1059
00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.629
to them as a dowry by their fathers when

1060
00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:18.530
they got married. That was theirs. It didn't become

1061
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.399
community property. It didn't belong to their husbands. Uh,

1062
00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:23.280
THEY could pass it on to their Children, including

1063
00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:27.639
their daughters. They were, uh, they were free to

1064
00:55:27.649 --> 00:55:29.969
move about in society. They were not kept at

1065
00:55:29.979 --> 00:55:32.760
home in, like, in ancient Greek times at certain

1066
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:38.649
periods uh they had, they, even in a patriarchal

1067
00:55:38.659 --> 00:55:41.580
society, there is no shortage of evidence for women.

1068
00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:43.870
And this is something actually that I focused in

1069
00:55:43.879 --> 00:55:45.949
the book that you mentioned. Weaver describes in kings.

1070
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.159
It's a, it's a book in which I used

1071
00:55:49.169 --> 00:55:51.060
a lot of small biographies to kind of build

1072
00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.600
up a history of the whole period. And I

1073
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.590
found that I, I right from the beginning wanted

1074
00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.750
to have women in the book. But it was

1075
00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.260
obvious that one couldn't write this book without women

1076
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.909
because there were so many important roles that women

1077
00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:08.449
played. I talked about the textile industry, which was

1078
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.699
the textiles made by the palace or made by

1079
00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:15.169
the temple. The vast majority of people who did

1080
00:56:15.179 --> 00:56:17.090
the spinning and the weaving were women and they

1081
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.850
were highly highly skilled professional women who were making

1082
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.810
textiles that were so valuable that they were traded

1083
00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.149
for gold and for silver from other lands really

1084
00:56:28.159 --> 00:56:31.129
um important role in the economy. There, there were

1085
00:56:31.139 --> 00:56:34.570
priestesses who had positions that were just as important

1086
00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.739
as a high priest, if not, sometimes more so

1087
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.120
um who were uh so important when they were

1088
00:56:41.129 --> 00:56:44.290
put into place in in, they were uh um

1089
00:56:44.439 --> 00:56:46.969
introduced into their position as high priestess that the

1090
00:56:46.979 --> 00:56:49.469
name of the year that year would be named

1091
00:56:49.479 --> 00:56:53.389
after that position being filled. Uh There were queens

1092
00:56:53.399 --> 00:56:58.239
who interacted diplomatically with other queens in other regions

1093
00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.439
that they very early on. One of the very

1094
00:57:00.449 --> 00:57:04.810
earliest uh archives found in Mesopotamia is the archive

1095
00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.500
of the queen named Baron am Tara who was,

1096
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.229
she had her own palace. She was married to

1097
00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:10.870
the king and the king was in charge of

1098
00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:14.590
the kingdom. But she had a uh an entire

1099
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:19.429
temple estate with fields and sheep and fisheries and

1100
00:57:19.439 --> 00:57:22.429
hundreds of workers and textile. Um AND that she

1101
00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:23.699
was in charge of it. So it was not

1102
00:57:23.709 --> 00:57:25.659
that she was doing it for her husband. It

1103
00:57:25.669 --> 00:57:28.449
was, it was her domain. And we know about

1104
00:57:28.459 --> 00:57:30.209
her much more than we know about her husband

1105
00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:34.110
actually because his palace wasn't excavated. So I think

1106
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.810
what's what's fascinating to see is that one can

1107
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.649
look at gender relations in in depth and to

1108
00:57:40.659 --> 00:57:45.219
see that at this very, very early stage, there

1109
00:57:45.229 --> 00:57:48.219
was no sense among the mesopotamians that women couldn't

1110
00:57:48.229 --> 00:57:50.370
do things. There was no sense of women being

1111
00:57:50.379 --> 00:57:54.459
inadequate, which I think is really fascinating even though

1112
00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:57.540
men were running the place, they weren't. I mean

1113
00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.260
running like a king in charge of a kingdom.

1114
00:58:00.479 --> 00:58:04.729
Um His, one of his chief advisor was usually

1115
00:58:04.739 --> 00:58:08.489
his wife. And in many cases, many, for example,

1116
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.010
the Kingdom of Ebla, the royal couple were considered

1117
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.929
to be joint rulers, they were, they ruled together.

1118
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:18.250
So women were taken terribly seriously and and um

1119
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:25.090
exercised all kinds of um um what's the time

1120
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.969
I'm going for here? I was gonna say rights,

1121
00:58:26.979 --> 00:58:29.110
but you're right in a way it isn't because

1122
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.590
they haven't developed the idea of rights, but they

1123
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:37.389
had societal permission and um and capacity to do

1124
00:58:37.399 --> 00:58:39.840
all sorts of interesting things. There were female scribes.

1125
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.719
Most scribes were not female, but there were some,

1126
00:58:41.889 --> 00:58:44.409
there were women who were physicians again outnumbered by

1127
00:58:44.419 --> 00:58:46.979
the men, but one could become a physician. There

1128
00:58:46.989 --> 00:58:51.120
were women in many, many interesting positions including even

1129
00:58:51.129 --> 00:58:57.040
surprisingly um bricklayers uh people and the chief of

1130
00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:59.510
some of the bricklayers was a woman and the

1131
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.159
there were women doing bricklaying. So some even of

1132
00:59:02.169 --> 00:59:04.330
the manual labor that one would assume was entirely

1133
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.709
male. Well, not so,

1134
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:11.070
and this is incredibly interesting because I mean, many

1135
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.199
times, we tend to have that simplistic idea that

1136
00:59:14.209 --> 00:59:19.510
perhaps how uh men in the 19th century in

1137
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.840
Europe and America fought about women that they were

1138
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:26.280
inferior beings and they were emotional and they should

1139
00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.830
be conscripted to domestic labor and stuff like that.

1140
00:59:30.669 --> 00:59:35.239
I, I mean, people perhaps in some ancient civilizations

1141
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:38.989
in some traditional societies like hunter gatherers, sometimes I

1142
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.800
talk on the show with anthropologists about that. Uh

1143
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:47.290
PERHAPS they are not so backwards if we are

1144
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.100
allowed to use that term here when it comes

1145
00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:53.899
to gender relations. And uh and they don't have

1146
00:59:53.909 --> 00:59:57.340
the those sorts of ideas when it comes to

1147
00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.239
women and their importance and what they can do

1148
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.219
what they are allowed to do and so on.

1149
01:00:04.669 --> 01:00:06.040
I think you're right. And I think when you

1150
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.889
look at what was being written in the 19th

1151
01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:11.719
century. There was often an assumption that, well, it's

1152
01:00:11.729 --> 01:00:14.320
ancient. So they must have had these norms, the

1153
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.159
women must have been kept at home, they must

1154
01:00:16.169 --> 01:00:18.399
have been considered inferior. And then when you actually

1155
01:00:18.409 --> 01:00:20.620
go and look at the texts that's not there.

1156
01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:24.959
That is um one of these modern suppositions. And

1157
01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:26.899
I think it partly it comes out of the,

1158
01:00:26.909 --> 01:00:29.500
the model of progress, you know, this idea that

1159
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.860
history is a history of progress from a barbarous

1160
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:35.189
beginning to a civilized present. And it's just not

1161
01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.659
true when you come to many aspects actually of

1162
01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:40.689
society where there've been ups and downs throughout, throughout

1163
01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:46.149
history and very early on women had much more

1164
01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:49.760
of a role in public life in early sumer

1165
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.070
than was true even um by the Neo Babylonian

1166
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.810
period, for example. So within the same culture, you

1167
01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.530
actually see women losing in a way some of

1168
01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.570
their public role uh by that time. And even

1169
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.429
then, even in the Neo Babylonian period, there was

1170
01:01:06.439 --> 01:01:10.429
still plenty of women doing um running businesses and,

1171
01:01:10.439 --> 01:01:13.570
and uh and being priestesses and so forth. So

1172
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.679
yes, I agree. I, I think that, that we

1173
01:01:15.689 --> 01:01:19.949
have assumptions that as if it was somehow innate

1174
01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:22.040
to humans and I don't think it is innate

1175
01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:24.520
to humans to treat women badly. I, I think

1176
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:27.870
that there is, is a quite an inspiring aspect

1177
01:01:27.879 --> 01:01:31.050
to this, which is that even in a patriarchal,

1178
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:33.770
very early culture. There are plenty of places where

1179
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.790
women had um had a, a equal standing in

1180
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.300
some ways in society. And I think one of

1181
01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:44.199
course reasons why they, it wasn't a matriarchy and

1182
01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:47.010
why matriarchy are so hard to find is that

1183
01:01:47.389 --> 01:01:50.729
biologically women have babies and that is going to

1184
01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:53.000
curtail the amount that they can actually do out

1185
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.790
in the, in the, in the big world. If

1186
01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.209
you're having eight Children that it's, it's going to

1187
01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:00.610
be a lot of pregnancy and a lot of

1188
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.989
childbearing. One really interesting group in, in Mesopotamia, in

1189
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.149
that same time of Hammurabi were a group of

1190
01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:10.909
women who were called the mediums and they were

1191
01:02:10.919 --> 01:02:13.939
dedicated to the gods or each one was dedicated

1192
01:02:13.949 --> 01:02:16.860
to a particular God of Shamash, the Sun God,

1193
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:19.649
but sometimes Murdoch, the God of Babylon, they weren't

1194
01:02:19.659 --> 01:02:22.879
allowed to marry. Uh THEY didn't have biological Children

1195
01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:28.639
and they became enormously influential business women who were

1196
01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:33.229
making loans and buying property and sending trade expeditions

1197
01:02:33.239 --> 01:02:34.840
and all kinds of things. So it really gives

1198
01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.850
you a sense that it perhaps is this distinction

1199
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.620
between the women who were having babies and the

1200
01:02:39.629 --> 01:02:41.179
women who weren't having babies and the women who

1201
01:02:41.189 --> 01:02:44.199
weren't having babies, nothing was stopping them from doing

1202
01:02:44.209 --> 01:02:46.620
basically the same things that men did in terms

1203
01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:47.959
of their business acumen.

1204
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.580
Yes, I, I think that the most interesting uh

1205
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:55.860
thing or things to look into when we, I

1206
01:02:55.870 --> 01:03:00.379
mean, are looking into ancient societies, historical societies, and

1207
01:03:00.389 --> 01:03:06.340
also, again, traditional contemporary societies is to look into

1208
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:11.850
um social structure, social organization, uh economic, uh how

1209
01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:16.540
the economy is structured uh ecological factors. Because that's

1210
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:19.959
actually what is most interesting when understand or trying

1211
01:03:19.969 --> 01:03:25.229
to understand where uh gender relations, the sexual division

1212
01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:27.659
of labor and so on comes from. And not

1213
01:03:27.669 --> 01:03:31.419
so much trying to come up with an idea

1214
01:03:31.429 --> 01:03:36.370
of what a supposed human nature is like or

1215
01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:39.919
should be like and then creating this sort of,

1216
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.830
I don't know, stereotypes or even archetypes of what

1217
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.689
a woman or a man is or should be

1218
01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:53.050
that are supposedly very ancient and universal and should

1219
01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.169
last forever. Right.

1220
01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:57.399
Right. And as I say, I mean, one universal

1221
01:03:57.409 --> 01:03:59.899
is obviously that, that women do have Children and

1222
01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:02.030
that is something that has, has obviously had an

1223
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.290
impact throughout human history. And I'm in saying women

1224
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.280
who had babies, obviously one needs women to have

1225
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.510
babies. I mean, the one doesn't have any, any

1226
01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.810
continuation of the human race unless, unless babies being

1227
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.120
had. But I do think it's interesting how, um

1228
01:04:15.129 --> 01:04:18.189
even in that, even among women who were mothers,

1229
01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.189
there were plenty of things that they were still

1230
01:04:21.199 --> 01:04:25.449
actively involved in, but it does, uh it, it

1231
01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:29.429
does sort of explain how you have both patriarchy

1232
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.030
and at the same time, a culture in which

1233
01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.699
women had plenty of um positions they could hold.

1234
01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:34.909
Yeah.

1235
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.540
And so you've also done work on specifically the

1236
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:43.250
Kingdom of Ha. So, I mean, tell us about

1237
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.459
it and the city of Turk as well. Uh

1238
01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:48.899
I mean, uh tell us about them and also

1239
01:04:49.030 --> 01:04:53.669
why did you get interested in the Kingdom of

1240
01:04:53.679 --> 01:04:57.770
Ha specifically? I mean, is, is there something special

1241
01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.580
about it or was it for some other reason?

1242
01:05:00.909 --> 01:05:03.270
It is, it's special but, but it was for

1243
01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.729
a very prag pragmatic reason, which is that my

1244
01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:08.979
doctoral advisor, um Giorgio Boat, he was excavating at

1245
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:13.629
Tarka. And when I was choosing my dissertation topic,

1246
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.090
it made sense to do something connected with the

1247
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.949
excavation that I was able to work on. So

1248
01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:21.810
I did go on to the excavation and um

1249
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.909
and worked there for just one season actually. But

1250
01:05:24.919 --> 01:05:29.189
it was absolutely an incredible experience, really fascinating. And

1251
01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:32.719
what I got interested in was that the um

1252
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:37.469
the the site of TKA was it was it

1253
01:05:37.479 --> 01:05:39.290
was occupied for a very long period of time.

1254
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.370
But the, the eras that are well represented from

1255
01:05:42.379 --> 01:05:45.929
the excavations there extend from about the end of

1256
01:05:45.939 --> 01:05:51.439
Hammurabi's reign to the period covered by the the

1257
01:05:51.449 --> 01:05:54.580
excavations maybe 1700 BCE. So it's a fairly short

1258
01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:57.550
period of time that um no, I'm sorry, maybe

1259
01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.110
uh it's later than that um 1600 BCE. So

1260
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:05.530
about 100 150 years of represented by the the

1261
01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.219
actual excavations there. What was fascinating to me was

1262
01:06:09.229 --> 01:06:12.169
that we were finding Ka form tablets in private

1263
01:06:12.179 --> 01:06:15.770
houses, which was really interesting because of course, then

1264
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.679
you have private archives, you have people and this,

1265
01:06:18.689 --> 01:06:20.570
this what I was talking about about neighborhoods within

1266
01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.610
cities. You have a whole neighborhood that literally we

1267
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.600
can see in the ground because it's being excavated.

1268
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.810
And then the, the documents from the houses there

1269
01:06:29.979 --> 01:06:32.179
tell you who lived in them, who was working

1270
01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:34.899
there, what their professions were, how they were related

1271
01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:37.699
to one another, brothers living next door to brothers.

1272
01:06:37.709 --> 01:06:40.739
All of this sort of wonderful, fascinating stuff about

1273
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:44.699
a community. All right. So before the excavation started

1274
01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:48.739
at Turka, they started in 1976 in the decades.

1275
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:52.300
Previous to that, a bunch of documents had been

1276
01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:57.320
found and, and, and uh acquired by museums around

1277
01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:59.959
the world that clearly came from the same site.

1278
01:07:00.179 --> 01:07:03.250
They have all of the same characteristics and in

1279
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.580
fact, they even name some of the same people.

1280
01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:07.639
So what I decided I was going to do

1281
01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:10.439
was to get those tablets that were from pre

1282
01:07:10.449 --> 01:07:13.860
previous to the excavation. There's about 16 of them

1283
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:16.169
and look at them and, and put them in

1284
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:17.969
the context of the documents that came from the

1285
01:07:17.979 --> 01:07:21.500
excavation in the end. What I ended up doing

1286
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.129
instead, that was my plan. What I ended up

1287
01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:27.590
doing instead was figuring out the chronology of the

1288
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.389
kingdom because until I could know what the dates

1289
01:07:31.399 --> 01:07:33.780
on those documents meant, I couldn't really deal with

1290
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:35.860
them as a corpus. And so what I thought

1291
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.179
was going to be the first chapter of my

1292
01:07:37.189 --> 01:07:39.389
dissertation as a doctoral student, ended up being the

1293
01:07:39.399 --> 01:07:41.729
whole thing, it was about the chronology of, of

1294
01:07:41.739 --> 01:07:45.120
the kingdom. And then I ended up that more

1295
01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.919
evidence came out later. And I didn't actually publish

1296
01:07:47.929 --> 01:07:52.729
the book about that until 2002. But the uh

1297
01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.169
the chronology became the thing I was really interested

1298
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:56.540
in. But then when I published my book, I

1299
01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:00.350
also included those, those tablets that previously had been

1300
01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.629
in uh collections around the world that needed to

1301
01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:04.879
be put together. So that was how I got

1302
01:08:04.889 --> 01:08:09.060
interested. But it is a fascinating place because Turka

1303
01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.919
was home to a kingdom. It's often called a

1304
01:08:12.929 --> 01:08:15.500
small inconsequential kingdom. I don't think it was, I

1305
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:17.290
think it will turn out to be quite important,

1306
01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:21.859
but it's called Hanna the Kingdom. And it was

1307
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:27.629
a kingdom which remarkably survived over 500 years and

1308
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:31.660
in the same general area and with the same

1309
01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:34.740
um scribal practices. And this is what was so

1310
01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:38.240
interesting is that you can identify Hanna texts by

1311
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.770
the way, the scribes wrote them, wrote the tablets

1312
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:44.580
and by the particular terms and, and phrases and

1313
01:08:44.589 --> 01:08:47.140
um and, and various quirks of of the tablets.

1314
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.200
So it, the tablets cover then a period from

1315
01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:57.529
around 1720 ish all the way up to the

1316
01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.660
12th century. I mean, really late. There are han

1317
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.669
attacks from the 11 hundreds. And that means that

1318
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.410
we have AAA sequence of kings of this region

1319
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:11.140
that covers such a long period of time that

1320
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:13.279
it actually becomes more important than just being this

1321
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:15.689
one kingdom. It helps us understand more about the

1322
01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.229
chronology of that whole period.

1323
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.799
And then a very interesting thing that happens between

1324
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:31.450
1595 and 1450 BC is what people call the

1325
01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:36.810
one the 100 years long, dark age uh where

1326
01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:42.189
few records were kept and what happened then basically,

1327
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.569
do we know that? No,

1328
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:46.479
we, we, we really don't know very much. In

1329
01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:50.709
1595 the first dynasty of Babylon came to an

1330
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.720
end and the last king Sam Suan was deposed

1331
01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:58.390
or he, he lost his throne. And then this,

1332
01:09:58.509 --> 01:10:01.850
we call it a dark age because it's just

1333
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.430
people stopped writing. Apparently there are no can form

1334
01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:08.810
documents found from most of Mesopotamia for as you

1335
01:10:08.819 --> 01:10:12.229
say, 100 years by about 1500 you begin to

1336
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.299
get some. So not much until 1450 as you

1337
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.939
say, but around 1500 there are some what was

1338
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:21.109
going on. We really don't know by the time

1339
01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.500
the, the sort of the mist dissolves and we

1340
01:10:24.509 --> 01:10:27.549
begin to get texts again. There's a new dynasty

1341
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.129
in Babylon of dynasty who are Cassy in origin.

1342
01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.830
Where did these CASS sites come from? It's a

1343
01:10:32.839 --> 01:10:35.609
fascinating question. There's a whole new kingdom in northern

1344
01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:38.910
Mesopotamia called Mitani. Where did it come from? Who

1345
01:10:38.919 --> 01:10:41.870
were its kings? How did they get into power?

1346
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.930
Um There's a lot of changes that have taken

1347
01:10:44.939 --> 01:10:48.660
place but this dark age in the sense that

1348
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:51.000
we don't have any documents that that really tell

1349
01:10:51.009 --> 01:10:55.180
us what was happening is, is fascinating and frustrating

1350
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:57.120
as historians because of course, we went to what

1351
01:10:57.129 --> 01:10:58.700
were the origins of the CASS sites? How did

1352
01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:00.620
they come to take the throne? How did the

1353
01:11:00.629 --> 01:11:04.779
the meal um Kingdom develop? How did it spread?

1354
01:11:05.569 --> 01:11:07.270
Part of this is just probably because we haven't

1355
01:11:07.279 --> 01:11:09.750
excavated the right places. Uh I suspect that there

1356
01:11:09.759 --> 01:11:11.450
are tablets that are yet to be found that

1357
01:11:11.459 --> 01:11:14.129
will tell us we'll answer some of these. But

1358
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.890
one solution for a while was to say that

1359
01:11:16.899 --> 01:11:19.479
perhaps that is just a perhaps we're mistaken that

1360
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:21.729
that was a century at all. There was a,

1361
01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.689
a movement for quite a while to um suggest

1362
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.310
that in fact, we just had the dates wrong.

1363
01:11:27.759 --> 01:11:30.100
And in fact, what we think of as 1595

1364
01:11:30.109 --> 01:11:32.500
was perhaps maybe like 1495 and there was just

1365
01:11:32.529 --> 01:11:36.060
100 years missing because we had simply mis misjudged

1366
01:11:36.069 --> 01:11:38.979
the dates lately that has gone out of fashion.

1367
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:40.200
And for a while I thought that was true.

1368
01:11:40.209 --> 01:11:42.129
Actually, I was, I was a proponent for what's

1369
01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.299
called the low chronology briefly, but what is now

1370
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:47.740
called the middle chronology, which seems to be the

1371
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.740
accurate one. Is it, it, it holds up and

1372
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.359
it does retain this dark age. But there are

1373
01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:56.040
two kingdoms that do seem to have continued to

1374
01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:59.470
produce documents. One is called the Sea Land which

1375
01:11:59.479 --> 01:12:03.060
is in the south uh the region around the

1376
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:06.000
city of or and south of there uh where

1377
01:12:06.009 --> 01:12:09.209
there seems to have been AAA thriving, we know

1378
01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.669
there was a thriving uh kingdom because a number

1379
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.899
of cities from that kingdom have been, have been

1380
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:17.609
excavated and discovered recently that continued into the the

1381
01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:22.290
missing century. And then also probably the the tablets

1382
01:12:22.299 --> 01:12:25.129
from TKA do too. So the Hana tablets do.

1383
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.990
The problem is, is we don't have enough of

1384
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.990
them yet. We have this really fascinating thing which

1385
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.490
is that there's a series of kings call, who

1386
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.930
call themselves king of the land of Ghana. And

1387
01:12:35.939 --> 01:12:38.919
they had beautiful cylinder seals and there are tablets

1388
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:40.839
from their re that suggest that they were powerful

1389
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:43.990
kings and that they ruled this region. But for

1390
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.799
each of the kings, there's maybe one or two

1391
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.149
tablets and that's not enough to build a, a

1392
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:52.560
history on. And so placing them chronologically is really

1393
01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:55.029
been challenging. And when I first was working on

1394
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.689
them, I was pretty sure they those kings bridged

1395
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:03.549
the gap between um 1595 and 1500 the 16th

1396
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.169
century. But I no longer think that's true. I

1397
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.000
think there's they are later. And that means that

1398
01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:11.790
perhaps Conor still doesn't have tablets from that period,

1399
01:13:11.799 --> 01:13:15.290
which would be very frustrating but we have to,

1400
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:17.229
we have to wait, I think there's, there are

1401
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.020
some tablets that are still going to be published

1402
01:13:19.029 --> 01:13:21.009
that would be very interesting to see that were

1403
01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.729
excavated. Um And those may have some answers and

1404
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:30.669
perhaps when excavations re restart in Syria, after the

1405
01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.580
um the the difficulties there and perhaps more will

1406
01:13:33.589 --> 01:13:36.649
be found. But it's, I think Hannah holds a

1407
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.790
key but it's not clear 100% yet. What that

1408
01:13:39.799 --> 01:13:40.350
key is,

1409
01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.819
you know, this is one of the things that

1410
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.640
I really love in my conversations with people who

1411
01:13:45.649 --> 01:13:50.439
do work on ancient history and with paleoanthropologists, for

1412
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:54.990
example, and archaeologists, because it's like we have a

1413
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.899
sort of an idea of a puzzle in our

1414
01:13:57.910 --> 01:14:01.120
minds with the sort of limited information we have

1415
01:14:01.129 --> 01:14:06.000
available limited resources, the excavations that people have done

1416
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.580
and we are limited to that. But then perhaps

1417
01:14:09.589 --> 01:14:12.609
over time as we excavate more places and find

1418
01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.990
new things, the puzzles and changes and then there

1419
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.569
are more missing pieces and then we get a

1420
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:24.785
few more pieces, but we're never 100% sure what

1421
01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:29.115
the, what are the missing pieces and what will

1422
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:31.595
the final puzzle look like?

1423
01:14:32.015 --> 01:14:34.615
Oh, very much. Yeah. It's exactly that I, I,

1424
01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:37.314
there was a, um, a scholar who described it

1425
01:14:37.325 --> 01:14:39.774
as if you imagine an ocean and there are

1426
01:14:39.785 --> 01:14:41.604
little islands in the ocean and the islands are

1427
01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:44.774
the parts we know and the ocean, which is,

1428
01:14:44.785 --> 01:14:47.015
is unfamiliar. It's like there are, there are mountains

1429
01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.615
under the ocean, but we, we can't see them

1430
01:14:48.634 --> 01:14:50.604
yet. And I feel that way very much about

1431
01:14:50.615 --> 01:14:52.615
mesopotamian history because there are these little bits that

1432
01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:55.350
we know really well. So for example, the, the

1433
01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:57.729
city of Mai, which I talked about, the city

1434
01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.890
of Mari, um excavations were done there and they

1435
01:15:00.899 --> 01:15:04.140
found a massive archive and it only covers 13

1436
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:06.490
years of history, but there's tens of thousands of

1437
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.560
documents. And so for that 13 years, we can

1438
01:15:10.569 --> 01:15:12.979
say so much about that one little kingdom under

1439
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:17.069
one little King Zimri Lim. But the his contemporaries,

1440
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.919
the people who were ruling with him, even Hammurabi,

1441
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.410
his palace hasn't been excavated. So we don't know,

1442
01:15:21.419 --> 01:15:25.310
we don't have his archive. There must have been

1443
01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:28.020
so much more and maybe there is still so

1444
01:15:28.029 --> 01:15:30.149
much more to be found. But we can say

1445
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.870
a lot about a number of things. And then

1446
01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:34.500
we have to sometimes say, we just don't know.

1447
01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:36.819
And with the 16th century, it's, it's one of

1448
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:40.060
those, we just don't know, it's something was happening

1449
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.529
and by the end of it, things have changed,

1450
01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.799
but it would be so nice to know more.

1451
01:15:45.759 --> 01:15:48.419
So I would like to ask you now about

1452
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:54.020
the importance of diplomacy during war specifically and how

1453
01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.419
the great powers from this period of time. And,

1454
01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.470
and now I'm going to focus mostly on the

1455
01:16:00.479 --> 01:16:06.040
late bronze age from 1595 up till around 1155

1456
01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:10.825
BC where in the near Eastern powers back then

1457
01:16:10.834 --> 01:16:13.495
were at war. And we have, for example, the

1458
01:16:13.555 --> 01:16:18.604
Caite Babylonians, the ides, the meals, the Egyptians and

1459
01:16:18.615 --> 01:16:23.115
other peoples at war. So um how was peace?

1460
01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:26.354
Uh FIRST of all, um I, I mean, how

1461
01:16:26.365 --> 01:16:30.714
did war look back then? Uh WHY were they

1462
01:16:30.725 --> 01:16:33.845
at war uh in that specific period of time

1463
01:16:33.854 --> 01:16:38.430
and, and how was peace achieved between them? Yeah.

1464
01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.149
Yeah. So we're coming out of the, you know,

1465
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.680
we finish the, the, the dark age of the

1466
01:16:42.689 --> 01:16:46.129
16th century. And there are these kingdoms as you

1467
01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.319
say, that had established themselves. And there are four

1468
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:51.000
major kingdoms at Cassa Babylonia, as you mentioned, Mitanni,

1469
01:16:51.959 --> 01:16:56.089
the Hittites in Anatolia and Egypt, those four powers.

1470
01:16:56.299 --> 01:16:59.049
And initially they weren't really in contact with one

1471
01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.410
another because they're very far away from one another.

1472
01:17:01.419 --> 01:17:04.009
But when they came into contact and when they

1473
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.589
came into conflict was in the Northern Levant. So

1474
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.350
in the region of Western Syria, there is um

1475
01:17:11.359 --> 01:17:14.479
an area that was, had particularly good ports. It

1476
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:16.930
was an area of a lot of trade and

1477
01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:19.180
also in the region that was called Kuwana, which

1478
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:22.479
is in the what later became called CIA um

1479
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:26.959
in, in uh South southern Turkey. And this was

1480
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.459
an area that three of the powers wanted control

1481
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:31.689
of the Hittites wanted to control it. Mitani wanted

1482
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.270
to control it and increasingly Egypt wanted to control

1483
01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:37.430
it as Well, so each one of these powers

1484
01:17:37.439 --> 01:17:40.339
is sending their forces into this region trying to

1485
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:44.939
gain control of this trading hub region. And they

1486
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:46.520
did, they, they fought one another. And we know

1487
01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.859
this, especially from Egyptian records where for example, Atom

1488
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:53.430
the third sends troops up into Mitani, which the

1489
01:17:53.439 --> 01:17:55.540
Egyptians called. Naha was their name for it. And

1490
01:17:55.549 --> 01:17:58.379
he describes taking a lot of booty back to

1491
01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:01.439
um Egypt, all of these animals and riches and

1492
01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:03.259
so forth that he took back with him. But

1493
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:05.859
he didn't manage to conquer Mitani at the time.

1494
01:18:06.759 --> 01:18:09.879
And what's interesting is that in his records, Tomos,

1495
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:14.419
the third's records, he describes that embassies came with

1496
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:17.330
tribute for Egypt from all of these foreign lands.

1497
01:18:17.339 --> 01:18:19.259
And he he names the foreign lands and they

1498
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:22.899
are clearly some of these regions around the Mediterranean,

1499
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:27.600
including um Babylonia, including perhaps Assyria at the time.

1500
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.839
Uh Greece is mentioned, it seems so these were

1501
01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:35.040
people sending diplomats to Egypt after Egypt had had

1502
01:18:35.049 --> 01:18:37.819
had raided Mitani. Now, of course, from the Egyptian

1503
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:40.790
perspective, they were just coming to bow down and

1504
01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:44.399
worship Thomas the third. But what he doesn't mention

1505
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:46.950
is that there had been a for over 1000

1506
01:18:46.959 --> 01:18:49.770
years by this time, a tradition of diplomacy across

1507
01:18:49.779 --> 01:18:52.649
the Middle East, the non Egyptian Middle East in

1508
01:18:52.799 --> 01:18:56.120
which people sent one another gifts and they sent

1509
01:18:56.129 --> 01:18:58.859
one another ambassadors and they worked out terms of

1510
01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:02.390
interaction and peace that had existed at least since

1511
01:19:02.399 --> 01:19:06.910
the time of EBR in 2400 specie. So, what

1512
01:19:06.919 --> 01:19:09.569
it looks like was actually happening is ambassadors show

1513
01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.140
up in Egypt, like, oh, you're new on the

1514
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:13.790
block. We don't know much about you. Um, YOU

1515
01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:16.850
have just made a raid into Mitani. We would

1516
01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:18.660
like peace with you because we'd rather you didn't

1517
01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:20.879
come and raid us. Here are some gifts, you

1518
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.129
know, we would like some gifts back from you

1519
01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.750
and we sort of setting up some kind of

1520
01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:27.160
diplomatic relationship. This is me guessing that that's what's

1521
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:30.560
going on. But I it looks right. Then later

1522
01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:33.430
he describes that the Chiefs of Mitani show up

1523
01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:35.799
in Egypt and he describes them begging for peace.

1524
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:40.169
But the thing is, is that it's probably not

1525
01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.009
that um I am sorry, I'm getting my, my

1526
01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.759
Egyptian kings wrong. We have to get into Amman

1527
01:19:45.959 --> 01:19:48.609
at the second AM at the second. He's raiding

1528
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.279
in this region. It's a hot, the second who

1529
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:54.899
describes these meal coming and begging for peace. And

1530
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:56.540
then in the ninth year of Amin at the

1531
01:19:56.549 --> 01:20:00.060
second, the wars stop. He's describes going out on

1532
01:20:00.069 --> 01:20:03.299
campaign into the Levant up until then in the

1533
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:06.390
ninth year. No more of that. And it seems

1534
01:20:06.399 --> 01:20:09.069
as though peace breaks out between the great powers.

1535
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.600
We don't have direct evidence until the time of

1536
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.290
Amin Hotep the third and that was in the

1537
01:20:16.299 --> 01:20:20.470
13 nineties, uh E ce 13, eighties AM hut

1538
01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:25.430
the third in Egypt was clearly in a relationship

1539
01:20:25.439 --> 01:20:28.629
of peace and alliance with his, with the other

1540
01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.430
great powers around the region. We know this because

1541
01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:35.129
his letters survive and we have this incredible uh

1542
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:38.379
collection of letters called the Amana letters found in

1543
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:41.149
Egypt. They're all on clay tablets, they were thinking

1544
01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.220
in air form and what they show is that

1545
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:46.470
the Egyptians had prior to the time, Bain H

1546
01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:50.830
at the third, adopted the whole diplomatic system that

1547
01:20:50.839 --> 01:20:53.220
had developed in Mesopotamia and become a part of

1548
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:56.109
it. And so that, whereas previously, like in Hammurabi's

1549
01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.339
time, this kind of diplomacy happened quite locally between

1550
01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:03.970
uh other Mesopotamian kingdoms. By the 14th century, it

1551
01:21:03.979 --> 01:21:07.640
had extended from Egypt to Babylon to Mitani to

1552
01:21:07.649 --> 01:21:12.450
Hati. These great powers were um in a relationship

1553
01:21:12.459 --> 01:21:18.100
of diplomatic um um alliance and peace with one

1554
01:21:18.109 --> 01:21:21.560
another. And these letters show it very clearly and

1555
01:21:21.569 --> 01:21:23.970
they show us the mechanisms of how it worked.

1556
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.410
And it was just the most fascinating period. I,

1557
01:21:26.419 --> 01:21:31.169
I find that era really striking because they didn't

1558
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.000
even threaten one another in their letters. The letters

1559
01:21:35.009 --> 01:21:36.790
I, once when I was first studying them, I

1560
01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:38.700
read someone writing a long time ago who said

1561
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:41.640
they're so boring. There's nothing about war, but that's

1562
01:21:41.649 --> 01:21:45.080
what makes them so fascinating. Right. There's no saber

1563
01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:48.049
rattling at all. They're not threatening each other. They

1564
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.229
were sending gifts, they were sending envoys back and

1565
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.850
forth. They married one another's daughters. They were um

1566
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:59.540
absolutely aware of one another in terms of writing

1567
01:21:59.549 --> 01:22:02.040
these letters and they knew who all about one

1568
01:22:02.049 --> 01:22:05.689
another's courts. And they managed to maintain this pretty,

1569
01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.189
pretty consistently, not completely without um skirmishes, but for

1570
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.500
200 years, almost this, this period of international diplomacy

1571
01:22:14.509 --> 01:22:15.089
continued,

1572
01:22:16.569 --> 01:22:20.520
uh which is really fascinating and, and probably something

1573
01:22:20.529 --> 01:22:25.540
that some of our contemporary politicians should learn from.

1574
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:26.290
Right.

1575
01:22:27.399 --> 01:22:29.549
Well, I think that the difference back then, of

1576
01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.330
course, was that there was no single power that

1577
01:22:34.339 --> 01:22:36.350
was more powerful than the rest. All of them

1578
01:22:36.359 --> 01:22:39.669
were about equally matched and they couldn't, they had

1579
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.020
real trouble fighting far away from their homeland. So

1580
01:22:43.029 --> 01:22:45.509
when Tamas the third did and am at the

1581
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.950
second did try and campaign in uh the Middle

1582
01:22:48.959 --> 01:22:52.359
East, they were in the Levant, they were really

1583
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:54.939
stretched thin. It was very expensive and they were

1584
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:56.939
in regions that they didn't know well. And these

1585
01:22:56.950 --> 01:23:00.520
were, and they were facing well armed, um really

1586
01:23:00.529 --> 01:23:03.569
equally matched armies. And it seems as though they

1587
01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.700
all kind of realized that this was not going,

1588
01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:06.700
they were not going to be able to conquer,

1589
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:08.520
he wasn't going to be able to conquer Mitani,

1590
01:23:08.899 --> 01:23:11.470
the, the Egyptian and the Malian king wasn't going

1591
01:23:11.479 --> 01:23:13.060
to be able to conquer Egypt and his I

1592
01:23:13.069 --> 01:23:15.310
king wasn't going to be able to conquer Babylon.

1593
01:23:15.319 --> 01:23:17.259
You know, this was just not going to happen.

1594
01:23:17.479 --> 01:23:20.859
And so by creating this peaceful relationship among themselves,

1595
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:23.609
they benefited, they got lots of luxury goods that

1596
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.740
they wouldn't have gotten otherwise. And they didn't have

1597
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.759
to spend all that money on their wars. So,

1598
01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:30.459
it's a different time and I, I think that

1599
01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.819
very specific features of it maybe make it a

1600
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:35.859
little bit hard to translate to the present. But

1601
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:37.180
really interesting.

1602
01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:40.520
Yeah. But at least the part of reps in

1603
01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:45.500
corresponding with one another trying to come up with

1604
01:23:45.509 --> 01:23:49.479
peace terms instead of just talking about war and

1605
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:51.560
being war. MERS. Oh,

1606
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:55.330
absolutely. And they, and I think it's, it's really

1607
01:23:55.339 --> 01:23:57.484
interesting that Egypt was willing to buy into this

1608
01:23:57.555 --> 01:23:59.145
because the rest of the Middle East had had

1609
01:23:59.154 --> 01:24:01.745
this. So Babylon Mitani and Hay, they had known

1610
01:24:01.754 --> 01:24:04.665
about this diplomatic system and they had had moments

1611
01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:10.625
of these peaceful relationships before Egypt is so separate

1612
01:24:10.634 --> 01:24:12.854
from this, from the other cultures up until this

1613
01:24:12.865 --> 01:24:16.955
point and so very self-confident. I mean, the Egyptian

1614
01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:18.995
kings were gods for heaven's sake. You know, the

1615
01:24:19.004 --> 01:24:21.399
others weren't gods. But the fact that the Egyptians

1616
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:24.140
were willing to sign on as, as they call

1617
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:27.069
them brothers. So the, this whole sort of language

1618
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.339
that they used, it was a brotherhood, they were

1619
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:31.299
equals, they were all great kings and they were

1620
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.680
brothers and in the beginnings of their letters, they

1621
01:24:33.689 --> 01:24:35.660
would lay this out to so and so my

1622
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:38.029
brother, so and so that's so and so your

1623
01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.660
brother and then they would say, may your house

1624
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:43.500
and your wives and your soldiers and your household

1625
01:24:43.509 --> 01:24:45.890
be well. And they all, they, they was, it

1626
01:24:45.899 --> 01:24:50.470
was a very um formulaic kind of uh in

1627
01:24:50.479 --> 01:24:53.080
the introduction to the letter. And then they had

1628
01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:56.029
to write an Acadian and the Egyptian scribes had

1629
01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.689
to learn Acadian in order to, had to learn

1630
01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.959
can form in order to write these letters. All

1631
01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:02.529
of this, the Egyptian kings were willing to do.

1632
01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.060
And it's rare for the Egyptian kings to say

1633
01:25:05.069 --> 01:25:07.560
anybody is their equal. You know, they're not, they're

1634
01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.939
not into being equals of someone. They, they're really,

1635
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.700
really powerful and yet they did at this period

1636
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:15.109
and they did recognize the equality of these other

1637
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:15.540
kings.

1638
01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:19.529
So before we talk a little bit about the

1639
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.529
legacy of Mesopotamia, I would like to ask you

1640
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.490
a specific question about the economy in Mesopotamia. So

1641
01:25:27.879 --> 01:25:32.750
uh how did the relationships between, let's say the

1642
01:25:32.759 --> 01:25:38.100
Royals and the peasants looked like? I mean, was

1643
01:25:38.109 --> 01:25:41.180
this, how was the economy organized? Was it a

1644
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:45.819
feudal system or what exactly?

1645
01:25:45.919 --> 01:25:48.990
No, it wasn't feudal. It, it varied in different

1646
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.140
time periods. Um People always paid taxes that was

1647
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:56.359
always part of the deal. Um Certain times the

1648
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:58.819
kings would give out land. This was especially during

1649
01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:01.919
the late bronze age where we have land grants

1650
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:05.359
to faithful civil servants. And what's interesting about them

1651
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:07.479
is those initially was, were taken as some sort

1652
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:10.000
of feudal system because it, it looks vaguely as

1653
01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:13.180
though it was um like the the system of

1654
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:16.680
the European middle ages, but it really wasn't because

1655
01:26:16.979 --> 01:26:20.669
there is no requirement of the person receiving the

1656
01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.169
land to do anything in exchange. It's not, I

1657
01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.750
will give you this land and you will provide

1658
01:26:25.759 --> 01:26:27.419
me this many troops or something like that. It's

1659
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:29.470
just I'm going to give you this land and

1660
01:26:29.479 --> 01:26:31.180
it does seem as though it was a reward

1661
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:35.089
for loyal service, but very curiously, especially in Casa

1662
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:38.560
Babylonia, there was a, there were statements in these

1663
01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:40.680
land grants that said this is for all time.

1664
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.379
This is your land for all time. So it's

1665
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:44.879
not as though the king couldn't, couldn't take it

1666
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:47.299
back again, which makes it very, not very feudal.

1667
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:49.459
You know, it has the king has very little.

1668
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:54.189
Um um HE, he's sort of giving everything away

1669
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.660
in an interesting way. Although there are letters that

1670
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:59.859
survive that do kind of belie that where there's

1671
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:02.140
a letter, for example, that was found in Newsy

1672
01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:05.740
where a king writes to a queen who he'd

1673
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:08.370
given no sorry, he wrote to another vassal king.

1674
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:10.310
And he said the land that I've given to

1675
01:27:10.319 --> 01:27:11.709
such and such a queen, I'm going to have

1676
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.759
to take away from her and I'm going to

1677
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:14.680
give it to another person. So it does seem

1678
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:17.240
as though it wasn't quite as eternal as the

1679
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:22.729
the records suggest. But at that particular time shows

1680
01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.450
a lot of engagement of the kings with their

1681
01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.509
subjects and with their civil servants that the king's

1682
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.839
seal appears on a lot of documents. The king

1683
01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:34.229
is often described as being present for various um

1684
01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.729
actions. And this is true in Hati. It's true

1685
01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.100
in Ugari, which was in the Levant. It's true

1686
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:42.430
in Hanna, in the text that I look at

1687
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:45.870
um true in Babylonia in this late bronze age

1688
01:27:45.879 --> 01:27:48.729
period, they do seem to have been surprisingly engaged

1689
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:53.359
with um with people not necessarily commoners. I don't

1690
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.279
think we're looking at, at people who were very

1691
01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:58.479
poor, but certainly with more of their population, that

1692
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:59.839
may have been true at other times.

1693
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:06.049
And did the commoners have any idea of, for

1694
01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:10.569
example, who the king was or the Royals were

1695
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.990
uh the royal family and so on then uh

1696
01:28:13.049 --> 01:28:17.930
if so, uh I mean, how did they relate

1697
01:28:17.939 --> 01:28:22.209
to their political leaders? Basically, how did they think

1698
01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:26.100
about them? Uh You've already mentioned uh if I

1699
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:30.209
remember correctly that at least in Mesopotamia, in Egypt,

1700
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.810
it was different. But in Mesopotamia, they didn't present

1701
01:28:33.819 --> 01:28:39.890
themselves or identify as gods, right? But yeah, yeah,

1702
01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:42.680
most of them. But, but, but apart from that,

1703
01:28:42.689 --> 01:28:47.069
I mean, how were the relations there? Basically,

1704
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:50.819
one problem is that the commoners didn't write. Um

1705
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:53.990
So we don't have documents written by them. It

1706
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.759
would be lovely if they had, you know, if

1707
01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:58.640
we had a diary of a peasant, that would

1708
01:28:58.649 --> 01:29:01.040
be fantastic. So the ways they come up in

1709
01:29:01.049 --> 01:29:04.089
documents tend to be with relationship to the the

1710
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.509
courts or to the temples. And at various times,

1711
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.029
a lot of people worked for the court and

1712
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.549
for the temple, especially for example, in the early

1713
01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.759
dynastic period and the third dynasty or which were

1714
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:17.450
before Hammurabi's time, there were thousands of people who

1715
01:29:17.459 --> 01:29:19.689
worked for the the palaces and the temples and

1716
01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.959
their names would appear and they would receive rations.

1717
01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:24.620
And so we know from the ration texts and

1718
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:26.520
from their description of their work that they were

1719
01:29:26.529 --> 01:29:28.899
closely tied to the, to the royal family or

1720
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:31.430
to the palace. But that's of course, because we're

1721
01:29:31.439 --> 01:29:33.189
excavating in a capital city. And those are people

1722
01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.560
who are there, what the rural peasants thought, I

1723
01:29:36.569 --> 01:29:39.339
have no idea because we don't have any records

1724
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:41.609
of them. We do know certain things though that

1725
01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.580
the kings did that made that perhaps it meant

1726
01:29:44.589 --> 01:29:46.890
that the peasants would know their names. And one

1727
01:29:46.899 --> 01:29:50.430
was that the dating system was based on the,

1728
01:29:50.439 --> 01:29:52.979
the year of the king. And so you had

1729
01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:56.080
the king's name in the year. So you you

1730
01:29:56.089 --> 01:29:58.680
might have the year in which the king did

1731
01:29:58.689 --> 01:30:01.089
build the great wall of Sar. And it might

1732
01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.930
be the year in which Hammurabi built the great

1733
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:05.060
wall of Sar or something like that. So even

1734
01:30:05.069 --> 01:30:06.990
if you're naming a year, I was born in

1735
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.790
the year Hammurabi built the wall of Sar, you're

1736
01:30:09.799 --> 01:30:13.299
remembering the king's name, that's one way. And later

1737
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:14.850
they would just number the years. So they would

1738
01:30:14.859 --> 01:30:17.029
say the the 30th year of king. So and

1739
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.680
so or whatever, but it still had the king's

1740
01:30:19.689 --> 01:30:22.490
name in it. That's one way the other I

1741
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.129
do think is that this in the late bronze

1742
01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:26.720
age, there might have been quite a lot of

1743
01:30:26.729 --> 01:30:29.819
movement of the kings around their states. And we

1744
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:31.750
see that because of the king's seal showing up

1745
01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:35.359
in so many documents. There's a debate about this

1746
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:37.700
though, whether the king was actually there, if it

1747
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:40.080
says that the king was there or was it

1748
01:30:40.089 --> 01:30:43.660
statue or was it someone representing him? If it

1749
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:45.819
was him in person, it suggests that he did

1750
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:47.649
quite a bit of traveling around his realm and

1751
01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.149
people might have had a chance to sort of

1752
01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.560
at least see the, the royal entourage going by.

1753
01:30:52.259 --> 01:30:54.319
Uh THAT'S unclear. Mhm

1754
01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:56.450
No, I, one of the reasons why I asked

1755
01:30:56.459 --> 01:30:58.700
you that question is because many times when I

1756
01:30:58.709 --> 01:31:03.359
think about uh how people lived back in uh

1757
01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:08.740
historical societies. II, I am also interested in trying

1758
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:13.359
to understand how they would think about themselves in

1759
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:17.799
relation to the place they lived in the country

1760
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:20.109
or the nation they lived in, if they were

1761
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.660
aware at all of the people who were basically

1762
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:28.649
their political leaders and who they were, what they

1763
01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.169
did. Uh And, and, and also in comparison to

1764
01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:36.509
how we think about the places they lived in

1765
01:31:36.589 --> 01:31:40.089
nowadays because I, I don't know, II, I I'm

1766
01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.410
not, I don't know at all. For example, if

1767
01:31:42.419 --> 01:31:46.390
someone who lived in, what we now call France

1768
01:31:46.399 --> 01:31:50.270
in the 13th century would think of themselves as

1769
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.109
a French person. You know what I mean?

1770
01:31:53.410 --> 01:31:54.979
So, yes, I do know what you mean. I

1771
01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:57.660
do think people thought of themselves as they identified

1772
01:31:57.669 --> 01:32:00.140
themselves by the, the region that they lived in

1773
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:03.509
rather than by the name of the country. But

1774
01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:06.490
I, I, you raise a really interesting question here

1775
01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.299
because what we do have from Hammurabi's reign is

1776
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:13.040
a lot of his correspondence which was found and

1777
01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:15.609
um especially correspondence with some of his high officials.

1778
01:32:15.939 --> 01:32:19.459
And he had this man whose name was Shamash

1779
01:32:19.879 --> 01:32:22.500
Shazier, who worked for him in the region of

1780
01:32:22.509 --> 01:32:25.490
Larsa where after he'd conquered Larsa and Shamash Hazier

1781
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.270
got letters from Hammurabi saying I heard from such

1782
01:32:28.279 --> 01:32:30.509
and such a man and he's a gardener and

1783
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.339
you've given his field to someone else. Now, that's

1784
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:36.810
really interesting because this gardener wrote to Hammurabi directly

1785
01:32:36.819 --> 01:32:39.379
to the king to claim to make the, you

1786
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:41.560
know, to say someone's taken away my land. Could

1787
01:32:41.569 --> 01:32:43.500
you do something about it? And there are enough

1788
01:32:43.509 --> 01:32:47.060
of these letters that it does actually imply that

1789
01:32:47.069 --> 01:32:49.580
people knew who the king was and knew that

1790
01:32:49.589 --> 01:32:52.040
if they had a real concern, he was the

1791
01:32:52.049 --> 01:32:54.000
person to appeal to and that he would be

1792
01:32:54.009 --> 01:32:56.029
the one to try and work it out. So

1793
01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.770
I think even though we don't have much that's

1794
01:32:58.779 --> 01:33:02.770
written someone hiring a scribe and, and writing a

1795
01:33:02.779 --> 01:33:05.069
letter to the king in that way does suggest

1796
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.390
that people knew who the king was. Yeah, and

1797
01:33:08.399 --> 01:33:10.470
how to get hold of him. And it also

1798
01:33:10.479 --> 01:33:12.810
always strikes me just because we have so we

1799
01:33:12.819 --> 01:33:14.879
have this very small part of his correspondence, just

1800
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:17.629
his correspondence with Sino Diam and Shamash Shazer and

1801
01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.959
a few other people, there must have been a

1802
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:22.149
lot more that the king was on top of

1803
01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.250
so much stuff. I mean, he was, he was

1804
01:33:24.259 --> 01:33:27.180
literally writing Shama Shazi saying this gardener whose name

1805
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:28.649
is such and such, you need to make sure

1806
01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.629
he gets his, his fields back if he's doing

1807
01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.229
that all across his country. That's, that's an enormous

1808
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.140
amount of real, almost micromanagement. So I think unlike

1809
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:41.600
your medieval peasants, I, I do suspect that they

1810
01:33:41.609 --> 01:33:43.669
had a sense of who the king was partly

1811
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.109
because of the year names, but partly also because

1812
01:33:46.379 --> 01:33:48.250
they did intervene quite a lot in, in the

1813
01:33:48.259 --> 01:33:51.100
individual lives. They also called people up for military

1814
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:53.839
service. They called people up for Corvey labor. I

1815
01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:57.529
mean labor, laboring on, on city walls and canals

1816
01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.939
and ditches and so forth. All of which also

1817
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:02.850
was um probably a reminder of who the king

1818
01:34:02.859 --> 01:34:03.180
was.

1819
01:34:04.049 --> 01:34:06.640
Yeah. And I would imagine that at least when

1820
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:10.229
they were in the military or doing military service,

1821
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:13.669
they would be told that they would be fighting

1822
01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.629
for Babylonia or a or Sumer or some other

1823
01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.100
place.

1824
01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.310
Yes. I don't know if they would be told

1825
01:34:23.319 --> 01:34:24.459
they were fighting for the king or if they

1826
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:26.310
were fighting for the country. I don't know. That's

1827
01:34:26.319 --> 01:34:29.100
a really interesting question. Or perhaps more likely they

1828
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:31.390
were fighting for Marduk. The God might be the

1829
01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:34.049
way that they would raise it. That might have

1830
01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:37.529
been true. Yeah, that's interesting. You've actually sort of

1831
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.549
got me thinking about all, all sorts of aspects

1832
01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.270
of this in terms of how we could prove

1833
01:34:42.279 --> 01:34:43.819
whether or not they knew who the king was

1834
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:45.859
and the soldiers, at least in Hamma Ai's time

1835
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:48.419
again, going back to the old Babylonian period, they

1836
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:52.089
were provided, not with um, a salary, they were

1837
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.910
provided with fields, which was called an Ilham. That

1838
01:34:54.919 --> 01:34:58.660
their family would farm and that would support them

1839
01:34:58.669 --> 01:35:00.419
would support the family so that they would then

1840
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:02.740
be available to go off on campaign during the,

1841
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:05.810
the season when they weren't farming after the harvest.

1842
01:35:06.069 --> 01:35:09.160
And so I think again, there, the Ilham directly

1843
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:11.209
comes from the king. He's the person who gives

1844
01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.479
you your income. So I do think that anyone

1845
01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:16.830
who was in this, there's such a lot of

1846
01:35:16.839 --> 01:35:19.000
ways in which the, the, the court and the,

1847
01:35:19.009 --> 01:35:21.919
and the, and the palace were intertwined with the

1848
01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:24.200
economy that I think, I think you would have

1849
01:35:24.209 --> 01:35:26.330
a hard time not knowing who the king was

1850
01:35:26.339 --> 01:35:28.660
if you were involved in any way in any

1851
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:29.240
of those things.

1852
01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:32.229
No, be because, uh, uh, uh, at least from

1853
01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.390
my perspective it would be extremely interesting to really

1854
01:35:36.399 --> 01:35:40.970
try to put myself into the shoes of someone

1855
01:35:40.979 --> 01:35:43.990
who lived back then in, I don't know, Babylonia

1856
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.339
Suma. And to really try to imagine how would

1857
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:51.319
they move in that world, how they would think

1858
01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:55.600
about their own group, identity if they would be

1859
01:35:55.609 --> 01:35:59.839
aware of where they were in terms of the

1860
01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:04.060
identity of their nation or kingdom or empire and

1861
01:36:04.069 --> 01:36:06.649
so on. So that, that, that would be very

1862
01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.479
interesting to know.

1863
01:36:08.089 --> 01:36:10.270
Yeah, even though we don't have, they didn't have

1864
01:36:10.279 --> 01:36:13.660
maps with borders on them during the, during some

1865
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:16.339
of the wars in the old Abalon period, especially

1866
01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:18.850
before Hammurabi's time, there were these battles that went

1867
01:36:18.859 --> 01:36:21.350
on. And in fact, I I wrote about this

1868
01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:23.490
in weaver scribes and kings that there are cities

1869
01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:26.850
where each time a king takes control, the year

1870
01:36:26.859 --> 01:36:29.770
names change. And so you go from being your

1871
01:36:29.779 --> 01:36:31.890
years are in the name of the local king

1872
01:36:32.009 --> 01:36:33.899
to the years of the king of Larsa and

1873
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:35.250
then the king of is in takes over. And

1874
01:36:35.259 --> 01:36:37.500
so it's his year names. And these, you see

1875
01:36:37.509 --> 01:36:40.000
this switch back and forth. So in that little

1876
01:36:40.009 --> 01:36:43.500
city, they are aware of who they're subject to

1877
01:36:43.509 --> 01:36:46.129
because they have to change their dating system and,

1878
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.069
and that was enforced by the king. So we

1879
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.450
do see that they are even though they may

1880
01:36:51.459 --> 01:36:53.000
not be a map saying you are currently in

1881
01:36:53.009 --> 01:36:55.520
Een. Oh no, you're currently in Larsa. There was

1882
01:36:55.529 --> 01:36:57.589
a, a an awareness because that's who they were

1883
01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.149
paying their taxes to and that's who they had

1884
01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.310
to date their documents by.

1885
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:06.209
So just uh before we finish, I have a

1886
01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.490
couple more questions about how you think uh as

1887
01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:15.149
an historian who studies Ancient Mesopotamia about the, the

1888
01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:20.089
legacy of Mesopotamia, actually, because we've talked here about

1889
01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:25.154
things like writing about some uh some city is

1890
01:37:25.165 --> 01:37:29.285
about systems of law. Uh uh THE uh Arabi's

1891
01:37:29.294 --> 01:37:34.705
code, for example, about mechanisms of diplomacy, about certain

1892
01:37:34.714 --> 01:37:39.834
institutions that were created or existed back then. So,

1893
01:37:39.845 --> 01:37:45.044
I mean, a lot of these still exists today

1894
01:37:45.205 --> 01:37:45.904
actually,

1895
01:37:46.145 --> 01:37:49.180
right? I think some of them, you can draw

1896
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:51.120
a direct line and you can see how they've

1897
01:37:51.129 --> 01:37:54.759
influenced the modern world without interruption. Others, it's harder

1898
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:57.560
to see that direct line. I think diplomacy actually,

1899
01:37:57.569 --> 01:38:00.339
one can trace all the way from their system

1900
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:03.479
of diplomacy to the present. I don't think it

1901
01:38:03.490 --> 01:38:06.370
was ever completely lost. I think that the the

1902
01:38:06.379 --> 01:38:09.799
structures that they developed probably do have um echoes

1903
01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:12.709
today. And I should point out this is very

1904
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.040
much the legacy in the Middle East um is

1905
01:38:15.049 --> 01:38:18.759
very powerful. I think sometimes Western scholars tend to

1906
01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:20.990
think about the, the legacy in, in Europe and

1907
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.810
in the Americas and so forth. But in the

1908
01:38:22.819 --> 01:38:26.220
Middle East, there's a huge legacy of this which

1909
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:29.649
is their own native culture coming through um all

1910
01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:32.879
of the periods that have, have developed since. And

1911
01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:35.750
I talking to, to um scholars of the modern

1912
01:38:35.759 --> 01:38:38.129
Middle East, we often will say, oh, you know,

1913
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.160
that's that was happening. You know, some people, they'll

1914
01:38:40.169 --> 01:38:43.220
be talking about something in say um in the

1915
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:46.500
16th century. And you can see how it has

1916
01:38:46.509 --> 01:38:48.770
its, its origins way back in the, in the

1917
01:38:48.779 --> 01:38:51.080
ancient Middle East. And so there's, there's a, a

1918
01:38:51.089 --> 01:38:54.720
lot of the world benefited from all of these

1919
01:38:54.729 --> 01:38:57.740
developments that, that came out of, of Mesopotamia and,

1920
01:38:57.750 --> 01:39:00.879
and elsewhere in the ancient Middle East. Writing, certainly,

1921
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:05.359
even though the writing system, Jon was lost writing

1922
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:08.189
as a phenomenon. Writing as a system of, of

1923
01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.439
keeping track of things. Yeah, huge impact. The very

1924
01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:15.890
idea of having a judicial system quite aside from

1925
01:39:15.899 --> 01:39:19.160
writing laws is so ancient and the idea that

1926
01:39:19.169 --> 01:39:22.160
you do not just engage in vigilante justice that

1927
01:39:22.169 --> 01:39:24.370
you have a system set up where there are

1928
01:39:24.379 --> 01:39:28.040
judges who are recognized as having authority and having

1929
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.410
wisdom. And, and this is really important. I think

1930
01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:35.379
the Mesopotamian system, they tried to make it um

1931
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:38.180
corruption proof. They really tried to make sure that

1932
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:40.220
you couldn't gain the system that you couldn't be

1933
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:43.040
above the law that you couldn't be um someone

1934
01:39:43.049 --> 01:39:46.759
who got away with things and the judges could

1935
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:48.959
be penalized if they took bribes. There, there were

1936
01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:50.919
lots of, of real attempts to make it a

1937
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:53.700
fair system. And I think that's clearly a legacy

1938
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:59.339
as well. Monumental architecture, cities living in cities in

1939
01:39:59.350 --> 01:40:02.100
a way that you people can get along with

1940
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:06.259
one another. Um There's, there's just so, so much

1941
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:08.250
and then the, the most obvious one which people

1942
01:40:08.259 --> 01:40:11.910
always bring up is, is the, the 60 seconds

1943
01:40:11.919 --> 01:40:14.049
in, in a minute and the 60 minutes in

1944
01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:16.250
an hour, that's, that's Mesopotamia. They had a, a

1945
01:40:16.439 --> 01:40:21.089
60 based numerical system and so 360 degrees in

1946
01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.450
a circle, that's them. All of those are, are

1947
01:40:24.459 --> 01:40:28.390
directly come directly from, from Mesopotamia. The anything with

1948
01:40:28.399 --> 01:40:29.600
a base 60 is theres.

1949
01:40:30.479 --> 01:40:33.089
And even though when it comes to science, if

1950
01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:36.729
I remember correctly, they also studied the stars, the

1951
01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.279
movement of the planets, dates of eclipses and stuff

1952
01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:41.490
like

1953
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.060
that. Yes, very much. They, they, they studied the

1954
01:40:44.069 --> 01:40:46.779
sky, um the night sky largely because they wanted

1955
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:48.259
to know the will of the gods, which was

1956
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:51.819
not why we do it today, but they um

1957
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:54.560
named the constellations and many of their names translate

1958
01:40:54.569 --> 01:40:57.020
into the names that we used that they had

1959
01:40:57.029 --> 01:40:59.299
the same, they saw the same images in the

1960
01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:02.160
sky that continued to be seen as the constellations.

1961
01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:07.160
They identified the five visible planets and uh and

1962
01:41:07.169 --> 01:41:09.350
tracked them through the night sky. And so, yes,

1963
01:41:09.359 --> 01:41:12.040
they could, they could actually predict eclipses of the

1964
01:41:12.049 --> 01:41:14.339
sun and the moon. They weren't quite sure where

1965
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:16.569
they were going to appear. And so sometimes of

1966
01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:19.129
course, they were wrong and they didn't see the,

1967
01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.850
the eclipse as anticipated because it wasn't, it wasn't,

1968
01:41:21.859 --> 01:41:23.689
they weren't in line in the line of it,

1969
01:41:23.819 --> 01:41:26.060
but they were very, very good astronomers. They were

1970
01:41:26.069 --> 01:41:29.450
also very good mathematicians. They had figured out what

1971
01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:32.189
we think of as the Pythagorean theorem. Way back

1972
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.810
in Hammurabi's time. I think it was lost and

1973
01:41:34.819 --> 01:41:37.729
Pythagoras rediscovered it. I don't think Pythagoras was, was

1974
01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:40.330
sort of stealing from the mesopotamians. But uh it,

1975
01:41:40.339 --> 01:41:43.370
it was known they, they had that they um

1976
01:41:43.419 --> 01:41:47.319
they had a number of uh military techniques, for

1977
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:49.790
example, that also, for example, the chariot was AAA

1978
01:41:49.799 --> 01:41:55.229
low engineer East. And well, it was certainly somewhere

1979
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.100
in the Middle East that they invented the chariot

1980
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:59.959
and it spread fast if it in fact spread

1981
01:41:59.970 --> 01:42:01.859
all the way to China. So the Shang dynasty

1982
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:07.200
chariot is clearly uh AAA Middle Eastern chariot that

1983
01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:12.299
was, was adopted over a long distance. Um They

1984
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:16.189
developed the phalanx formation of the soldiers back in

1985
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:19.160
the third millennium BC. So it's often attributed to

1986
01:42:19.169 --> 01:42:20.589
the Greeks being the first ones to come up

1987
01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.299
with that, but it was clearly being used. You

1988
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:23.890
can see it from the artwork in the, in

1989
01:42:23.899 --> 01:42:27.890
the third millennium. And the art influenced gosh, you

1990
01:42:27.899 --> 01:42:32.950
know, the Mesopotamian art, the, the um Assyrian art

1991
01:42:32.959 --> 01:42:36.549
influenced the Persians. It influenced the uh the Greeks.

1992
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:39.580
There was, there's almost more than one can think

1993
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:41.759
of in terms of how much it has contributed

1994
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:42.709
to the, to the world.

1995
01:42:43.569 --> 01:42:46.810
And one thing just to put things into perspective

1996
01:42:46.819 --> 01:42:50.069
here, one thing that I find really fascinating when

1997
01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.970
reading about the mesopotamians, for example, in other peoples

1998
01:42:53.979 --> 01:42:57.569
is that we tend to have these very, let's

1999
01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:01.020
say, solidified the idea that people back then were

2000
01:43:01.029 --> 01:43:06.350
extremely different from what we are nowadays. But I

2001
01:43:06.359 --> 01:43:10.859
mean, even though we have perhaps uh different technology,

2002
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:16.600
different building materials and uh different jobs. I mean,

2003
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:19.759
there are many aspects of our daily lives, the

2004
01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:24.200
things we worry about the institutions we have that

2005
01:43:24.209 --> 01:43:27.120
are actually perhaps not that different.

2006
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:30.419
Yes, it's really true. II, I go back and

2007
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:32.060
forth on this because on the one hand, I

2008
01:43:32.069 --> 01:43:34.370
want my students to realize things were very different.

2009
01:43:34.379 --> 01:43:39.000
They especially things like religion and um, and technology,

2010
01:43:39.009 --> 01:43:41.049
of course, we, we do everything by the clock.

2011
01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:42.859
They didn't have a clock. There's, there's a number

2012
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.279
of ways in which life was very different, but

2013
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:47.500
we have this shared humanity and I do think

2014
01:43:47.509 --> 01:43:50.970
that that really comes out that you're right. They

2015
01:43:50.979 --> 01:43:54.109
worried about their families. Um, SOMEBODY left on a

2016
01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.609
trip and they would write letters to one another

2017
01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.410
to make sure they were OK. They would uh

2018
01:43:59.910 --> 01:44:04.000
be concerned about their Children. They, uh they ate

2019
01:44:04.009 --> 01:44:05.410
the same, many of the same things we do

2020
01:44:05.419 --> 01:44:07.410
today. In fact, the recipes that have been found

2021
01:44:07.419 --> 01:44:11.229
from Mesopotamia, you can cook them. They're delicious. They

2022
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.549
had, they had houses, they had streets, they had

2023
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.270
cities, they had so many things that we still,

2024
01:44:19.279 --> 01:44:22.990
we still live with. And I, I've often thought

2025
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.500
that if um humankind manages to survive for another

2026
01:44:27.509 --> 01:44:32.060
10,000, 20,000 years, they'll look back at our culture

2027
01:44:32.069 --> 01:44:34.740
and see really strong connections. I mean, that we

2028
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:36.220
will probably be in the ancient world to them.

2029
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:38.819
They'll, they'll, the ancient world will cover Mesopotamia too.

2030
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:42.100
Who knows? The industrial revolution maybe. But, but so

2031
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:46.339
much of what um was set in place in,

2032
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:48.930
in the ancient Middle East, but also in other

2033
01:44:48.939 --> 01:44:52.290
ancient cultures around the world has continued, has, has

2034
01:44:52.299 --> 01:44:55.169
it worked well? It, it's, it hasn't been um

2035
01:44:55.890 --> 01:45:00.100
it hasn't been radically changed, things like justice and

2036
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:03.359
um and farming and, and so forth. It, it's

2037
01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:06.649
become more technologically advanced, but the way we cook

2038
01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:09.040
is the way we cook, still those things we

2039
01:45:09.049 --> 01:45:09.629
share a lot.

2040
01:45:10.759 --> 01:45:13.560
Uh And just one final question then, then this

2041
01:45:13.569 --> 01:45:17.779
is more of a, let's say, philosophical slash existential

2042
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:22.810
question because there's always the aspect that uh lots

2043
01:45:22.819 --> 01:45:27.384
of uh the history of Mesopotamia w was just

2044
01:45:27.555 --> 01:45:32.875
historically sp speaking very recently uncovered and some of

2045
01:45:32.884 --> 01:45:35.895
it could have been lost forever. And perhaps there

2046
01:45:35.904 --> 01:45:39.455
are pieces of it that will actually be lost

2047
01:45:39.464 --> 01:45:43.649
forever. So I mean, when it comes to, let's

2048
01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:48.080
say being a, a king, being an emperor, being

2049
01:45:48.089 --> 01:45:51.879
someone with very high status in a given society

2050
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:56.279
and perhaps being very arrogant that we will be

2051
01:45:56.290 --> 01:46:00.750
remembered forever. I mean, when you study history, don't

2052
01:46:00.759 --> 01:46:04.689
you sometimes get that, uh, sense that perhaps, oh,

2053
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:08.600
my God may maybe even if people reach very

2054
01:46:08.609 --> 01:46:13.870
high status in their society. Uh, I mean, there's

2055
01:46:13.879 --> 01:46:17.979
always the risk that they will actually not be

2056
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:21.189
remembered forever. I mean, is that something that you

2057
01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:21.959
think about,

2058
01:46:22.029 --> 01:46:24.450
or? I actually, it's funny because I think about

2059
01:46:24.459 --> 01:46:27.169
the, the, the flip side to that, which is

2060
01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:31.290
that what is so surprising because the Mesopotamians wrote

2061
01:46:31.299 --> 01:46:35.500
on clay and clay is pretty indestructible. We know

2062
01:46:35.509 --> 01:46:38.149
the names of so many people who would never

2063
01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.290
have dreamed that they would be remembered. I, I've

2064
01:46:41.299 --> 01:46:44.950
done this um I published in um eon magazine

2065
01:46:44.959 --> 01:46:49.149
on online an article about Gimel Karak. Gimel Karak

2066
01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.609
was a barber. He was an important barber. He

2067
01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.330
was a barber to the king, but he was,

2068
01:46:53.339 --> 01:46:56.100
he was a barber in a small town. I

2069
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:57.919
know so much about him. I know the name

2070
01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:00.140
of his son. I know who his neighbors were.

2071
01:47:00.209 --> 01:47:03.220
I can reconstruct what his life was like. And

2072
01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.899
that I think is, is, is the, is the,

2073
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:08.100
is the sort of, as I said, the flip

2074
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:10.600
side of someone who was really, really powerful at

2075
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:13.100
the time when we've forgotten about them. Yeah. OK.

2076
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:17.419
But how exciting that we can bring life back

2077
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:20.479
to people who would never have dreamed they would

2078
01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:23.580
be remembered. And here we are talking about them

2079
01:47:23.859 --> 01:47:27.319
thousands of years later because they left a written

2080
01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:29.890
record. Somebody left a written record of them. There's

2081
01:47:29.899 --> 01:47:31.959
even a woman named Zoo who I wrote about

2082
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:34.359
in, in weaver scribes and kings. She was a

2083
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:37.919
textile worker. She was a very poor woman, but

2084
01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:40.359
she worked her way up to be the supervisor

2085
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:43.319
of her weaving team in the palace at the

2086
01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:46.410
city of Gir. And we, we can talk about

2087
01:47:46.419 --> 01:47:49.060
Zoom and there she is, she's, she's a real

2088
01:47:49.069 --> 01:47:51.310
person and she's got a real name and we

2089
01:47:51.319 --> 01:47:53.609
can, we can sort of bring her back in

2090
01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.350
an interesting way because of these documents being found.

2091
01:47:56.930 --> 01:48:01.129
And I think future archaeologists will no doubt, find

2092
01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:04.020
more um can from tablets. There's certainly more to

2093
01:48:04.029 --> 01:48:06.609
be found and they will decipher and, and translate

2094
01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:09.080
more of the ones that we already have and

2095
01:48:09.089 --> 01:48:11.299
more and more people will come to light. But

2096
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:13.459
the kings, I think a lot of the kings

2097
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:15.879
who wanted to be remembered are remembered. And it's

2098
01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:17.899
sort of funny because there's some of them tried

2099
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:20.529
so hard. There was a king named Shogi who

2100
01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.529
actually had hymns written to himself. He's one of

2101
01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:24.439
those rare kings who did claim to be a

2102
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:28.220
God. And um, and they would, they, he insisted

2103
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:30.529
that the scribes copy the, the hymns to his

2104
01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:33.220
greatness in their scribal school. And it worked, you

2105
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:34.970
know, we've, we've got those hymns, we know that

2106
01:48:34.979 --> 01:48:37.600
she thought he was pretty great stuff. But I

2107
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:40.930
am more intrigued by the people who didn't try

2108
01:48:40.939 --> 01:48:42.549
so hard and yet we still know who they

2109
01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:42.859
are.

2110
01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.399
Great. So uh just before we go, would you

2111
01:48:47.410 --> 01:48:50.259
like to tell people where they can find you

2112
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:52.740
and your work on the internet? And of course,

2113
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:55.279
I'm also leaving a link to your books on

2114
01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:56.359

2117
01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:04.890
to put on the X I tend to put

2118
01:49:04.899 --> 01:49:06.979
out information about talks. I'm doing, I'm also on

2119
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:09.970

2122
01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.959
