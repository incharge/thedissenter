00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.550
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lops. And

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.199
today I'm joined by Doctor Paul Halpern. He is

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.909
Professor of Physics at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia.

5
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.250
He is the author of several books. And today

6
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.610
we're focusing on his latest one, the Allure of

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.500
the Multiverse, extra dimensions, other worlds and parallel universes.

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.850
So Paul, welcome to the show. It's a big

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.030
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.170
My pleasure to thank you for having me on

11
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.090
your show, Ricardo.

12
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.360
So let's start with this then. Uh I know

13
00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:35.970
that in the book, you go through a little

14
00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:38.990
bit actually of the history behind the idea of

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.459
the multiverse and the UX you of of course,

16
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.209
focus mostly on physics, but you also talk about

17
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.549
the ideas of some philosophers, for example. So do

18
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.610
you know how old is the idea of the

19
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.090
multiverse actually?

20
00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:00.750
Well, it's interesting because the term multiverse goes back

21
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.550
to William James who was a, a writer and

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.360
uh and also kind of an early psychologist. And

23
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.209
uh he talked about the psychological idea of a

24
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.769
multiverse back in the 19th century uh as kind

25
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:21.529
of a morally ambiguous universe, that a universe that

26
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620
was neither good nor evil and was pretty much

27
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:28.540
ambivalent to whether someone is good, someone is evil.

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.980
So he called it kind of a moral multiverse.

29
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.150
But that's just a term. I don't think he

30
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.230
meant that in the sense of parallel universes and

31
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.099
the idea of parallel universes and science really took

32
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.150
off in the 19 seventies and 19 eighties and

33
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.010
especially in this century, in the 21st century, the

34
00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:53.599
idea really became popular but going all the way

35
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.949
back to the people like Giordano, Bruno, uh you

36
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.900
know, the Italian uh philosopher, that's when people start

37
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.250
talking about many worlds out there, worlds that might

38
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:12.149
be similar to earth. And Bruno, of course, famously

39
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.440
was burned at the stake for writing that there

40
00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.095
are an infinite number of worlds out there. And

41
00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.764
some of those could be, you know, inhabited and

42
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.404
like earth. And he speculated about this and that

43
00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:29.145
was considered uh heresy blasphemy by the Roman inquisition.

44
00:02:29.154 --> 00:02:32.054
And, you know, sadly, he was killed by the

45
00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:36.104
Roman inquisition for, for that heresy and other heresies.

46
00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.929
And then around the same time, Galileo, who was

47
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.490
a little bit higher placed, he had more connections.

48
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.199
So he wasn't uh luckily he wasn't executed, but

49
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.770
he also speculated about, you know, many worlds out

50
00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.050
there. And then in the 19th century, based upon

51
00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:58.559
Newtonian physics, Newtonian determinism, uh people start figuring out

52
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.449
that if you have a finite number of elements

53
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.039
a finite number of possibilities. But an infinite universe

54
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.320
eventually all the combinations would start to repeat themselves.

55
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.229
So just like if you're playing uh the game

56
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.080
of chess, eventually you run out of moves and

57
00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.710
would repeat the same moves. They're not an infinite

58
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.660
number of moves in chess. Similarly, uh if you

59
00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.729
had an infinite universe, but a finite number of

60
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.339
elements and a finite number of possibilities, eventually, you

61
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.539
would have something like Earth recreated and the philosopher,

62
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.789
while the the revolutionary uh Luis Blanc Blanche in

63
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.389
France, while he was imprisoned in a fortress for

64
00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:48.809
revolutionary activity, speculated that there might be um many,

65
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.570
many copies of Earth out there that some of

66
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.660
them might be exact, some of them might be

67
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.869
inexact. And maybe some of the things that play

68
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.250
out on Earth would happen in some of the

69
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.330
other universes such as, you know, French revolution and

70
00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:05.669
so forth. So it's kind of interesting to think

71
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.190
about this. But now we know that the universe

72
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:14.130
is expanding and accelerating its expansion. So and it

73
00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.709
might be that there is a duplicate Earth out

74
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.760
there, but it would be so far away from

75
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.109
us will be well beyond the possibility of observation,

76
00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:29.640
well beyond the observable universe, because the sheer probability

77
00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:33.920
of creating uh something that's exactly like the Earth

78
00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:38.299
would be so minimal that it would take far

79
00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.380
longer than the than the time length of the

80
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.049
Big Bang and far greater than the size of

81
00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.260
the observable universe to recreate something like that. So

82
00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.220
it's, it's pretty much impossible.

83
00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:54.040
So one idea that you mentioned there, the fact

84
00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:57.980
that people at a certain point notice that if

85
00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:02.359
there are a limited number of possible arrangements of

86
00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:08.649
matter, then if time is infinite, then eventually the

87
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.959
same configurations would repeat themselves over time. That's actually

88
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.070
something that comes around also in Nietzsche, right? And

89
00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:19.709
the idea of the eternal return because I, I

90
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.350
guess that in that aspect, he was influenced by

91
00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:27.829
some uh physicists back in the 19th century, right?

92
00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.429
Yeah.

93
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.190
So Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher um came up

94
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.730
with the idea of eternal return. And uh he

95
00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:42.570
unlike uh Eastern philosophers, he talked about an exact

96
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:47.510
repetition of history. Um So he imagined that his

97
00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:51.209
life and all of its pain and suffering and

98
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.980
some joy, mostly a little bit of joy would

99
00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:59.450
um repeat itself sometime in the future just based

100
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:04.480
upon the idea of chance reoccurrence. So, you know,

101
00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.880
for any kind of game with finite elements, I

102
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.320
mentioned chess, but also the game of tiktok Toe

103
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.920
with Xs and Os. Eventually you just run out

104
00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:18.279
of moves. And Tik Tok Toe, if you're familiar

105
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.540
with it has a square, has nine uh elements

106
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.140
in a square with Xs and Os is the

107
00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:28.609
only possibilities. And it's, it could be a boring

108
00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.200
game if you play it long enough because you

109
00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:33.779
repeat the same moves again and again. And similarly,

110
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.899
Nietzsche thought that his life will repeat itself. But

111
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.799
if we estimate how long it would take for

112
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:45.299
earth to repeat itself, uh It was, you know,

113
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:50.500
far, far, far, you know, almost unimaginably far longer

114
00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:54.260
than the history of the universe. So it's, it's

115
00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:59.559
incredibly unlikely as people like uh Nietzsche's contemporary Ludwig

116
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.440
Boltzmann pointed out Boltzmann talked about the idea of

117
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.019
the arrow of time and increasing entropy. People said,

118
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.380
hey, wait a minute, things could randomly come together

119
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:15.000
again. But the estimate of that happening, it's just

120
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.559
incredibly improbable. So uh normally we don't have to

121
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.420
worry about it.

122
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.489
Mhm But uh let me just ask you one

123
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.329
question since you mentioned Giordano Bruno there earlier and

124
00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:31.290
also Galileo and I, we're talking about Nietzsche because

125
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:34.119
if I understand it correctly, uh For example, Giordano

126
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.809
Bruno was uh talking back then in the 16

127
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.859
century or so about there being other worlds. But

128
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:46.980
by worlds, I guess he was referring mostly to

129
00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:50.779
planets, other planets like earth out there, I mean,

130
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.619
but so uh and if those people are mostly

131
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.700
talking about uh other worlds in our universe or

132
00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.980
in the case of Nietzsche inside of our universe,

133
00:08:02.989 --> 00:08:09.209
things repeating themselves over time. Uh That isn't exactly

134
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.720
the same thing as a multiverse. Yeah,

135
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.579
that is an excellent point. And that's why I

136
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.859
say the modern idea of a multiverse, actual multiverse

137
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:24.690
started in really in the 19 seventies when you

138
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.700
had Bryce de Witt popularizing the idea of Hugh

139
00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:33.020
Everett of um what's called the many worlds interpretation

140
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.280
of quantum mechanics. And that's a name that Dewitt

141
00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:39.830
uh almost coined. He said many universes, but it

142
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.808
became many worlds. And then Brandon Carter took that

143
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.799
idea and turned it into the, you know, variation

144
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:49.979
of it into the anthropic principle. And then later,

145
00:08:49.989 --> 00:08:53.349
other scientists took that idea to try to explain

146
00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:55.309
fine tuning and I'm sure we'll talk about that

147
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.210
later. But that was an actual idea of something

148
00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:03.900
beyond the physical universe. But, you know, our scope

149
00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:10.159
has expanded over the centuries. So of course, um

150
00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:12.260
in a time of Pythagoras, the time of the

151
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.059
ancient Greeks, no one imagined that there was really

152
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.590
anything beyond earth. And maybe the, you know, the

153
00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:23.429
Pythagorean talked about a central fire, but they talked

154
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.039
about 10 objects including the celestial sphere, which was,

155
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.950
you know, this the dome of stars and that

156
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.679
was kind of considered something fixed out there, not

157
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.130
something with, you know, unlimited objects, but something that

158
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.830
was just kind of this fixed dome, fixed uh

159
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.669
element. And um you know, these planets, but we

160
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:51.169
had no idea what the scope of the the

161
00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:54.099
galaxy was, let alone the universe. And then of

162
00:09:54.109 --> 00:09:57.190
course, in the time of Galileo and Bruno, we

163
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.130
started to think about um other stars, other planets

164
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.909
uh but they weren't known yet and it was

165
00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:08.940
only in the 19 nineties, believe it or not

166
00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:14.700
that um astronomers detected the first exoplanets beyond the

167
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.859
solar system. And that was, you know, when we

168
00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:22.190
got to confirm that hypothesis, finally, Bruno hypothesis that

169
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.340
there are actually other planets around other stars. And

170
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:28.710
now most astronomers think that there are trillions of

171
00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:32.020
planets out there. You know, just based upon the

172
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.169
ones we've found so far, the thousands of ones

173
00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:37.780
we've found so far, if you extrapolate, there are

174
00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:42.179
likely planets around most stars. So we can talk

175
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.510
about trillions of planets out there. But then within,

176
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.570
you know, within the last 100 years, believe it

177
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.200
or not. Um That's when we discovered other Galaxies.

178
00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:59.090
It was only really in 1926 with the observations

179
00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:03.090
of Edwin Hubble that we showed that the Andromeda

180
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.580
nebula as it was called, it was thought to

181
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.770
be a gas cloud was really an object outside

182
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.469
of, of our own own galaxy. And that resolved

183
00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.049
what was called the great debate over whether or

184
00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:19.599
not the milky way was the only object give

185
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:22.650
or take a few things in the periphery or

186
00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:25.330
if there are numerous Galaxies out there.

187
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.489
And how do physicists themselves uh think about the

188
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.250
multiverse? And are there different conceptualizations of what the

189
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.210
multiverse might be among

190
00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:44.000
physicists? Yeah. So there are many different multiverses which

191
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.099
can be a little bit confusing and none of

192
00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:49.849
them are really like the cultural idea of the

193
00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.419
multiverse, which you can also talk about, which is

194
00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:56.500
the multiverse in movies. So everyone imagines in movies,

195
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.270
you know, you wake up and you, you go

196
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.880
through a portal and you see a near identical

197
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.239
version of yourself or you see, you know, a,

198
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.989
a superhero that has a different origin story, like

199
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.770
a different Spiderman or different, you know, different version

200
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.780
of ultra or whatever, like different superheroes. But uh

201
00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:22.979
you know, in, in physics, the multiverse ideas are

202
00:12:22.989 --> 00:12:26.630
confined to either something having to do with the

203
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.929
very small or something having to do with the

204
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.280
very large. So either quantum multiverse or a cosmological

205
00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:39.909
multiverse. And the quantum multiverse is usually called the

206
00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:43.760
many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. And that was

207
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.130
developed by Hugh Everett the third who was a

208
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.619
student of the great American physicist John Wheeler, who

209
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.700
I who I had the pleasure of meeting before

210
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.549
he passed away, very interesting fellow. And whoever it

211
00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:02.039
proposed the idea that when you take a quantum

212
00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:06.830
measurement, you the observer do not affect the measurement,

213
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.010
uh you do not influence the measurement. So then

214
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.989
the question arises, how come you get an exact

215
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
result? Whereas we know in quantum physics, you have

216
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.270
a blending of possibilities before the measurement is taken.

217
00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:23.349
How do you get an exact result when the

218
00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:26.320
measurement was taken? And the old idea, the orthodox

219
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.590
idea is that the measurer collapses the wave function

220
00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:34.520
down to one possibility like knocking over a a

221
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.690
stack of of cards and collapsing it down to

222
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.380
a single pile. Well Everett's idea is that the

223
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.979
measurer does not affect anything. Rather the measurer sees

224
00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:51.820
all the possibilities, all the the different outcomes at

225
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.630
once. Well, how can that happen? Because the measurers

226
00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.469
conscious uh conscious record says, I see one observation.

227
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.020
So that must mean that the measures consciousness branches

228
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:11.289
out into multiple possibilities. And each version of the

229
00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:14.859
conscious observer sees a different value or a different

230
00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:18.520
outcome of the measurement. So there's a branching of

231
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:25.070
human beings that matches the branching of quantum outcomes

232
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.440
and that all matches up with a universal wave

233
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.940
function that never collapses. But there's all these possibilities

234
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.299
out there in different enclaves of the universe. So

235
00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:41.070
that gives you parallel universes. So that's a quantum

236
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.659
idea and cosmology. It's the possibility of other bubble

237
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:50.369
universes out there aside from the Big Bang. So

238
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.590
aside from uh our own Big Bang, that there

239
00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:56.719
are other universes expanding out there just beyond the

240
00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:00.210
range of observation. And that for some people is

241
00:15:00.219 --> 00:15:04.229
more palatable because that's not something that's happening all

242
00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:08.789
the time. This is something that um happens, you

243
00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:12.830
know, with a cosmogenesis event, a uni universe creation

244
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.940
event. And it almost seems in a way logical

245
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.510
if our universe is created in a in a

246
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.330
relatively easy way through um you know, the observable

247
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.929
universe created in a process called inflation that maybe

248
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.989
inflation happens, you know, elsewhere in in reality.

249
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:40.500
And so those are the main reasons uh why

250
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.710
the theoretical physicists have theorized about the possible multiverse

251
00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:50.950
is I, is it for with, with the idea

252
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.830
of explaining those aspects of our reality?

253
00:15:56.039 --> 00:16:00.059
Yes. Well, we want to explain the observable universe

254
00:16:00.349 --> 00:16:04.320
and we want to explain the observable results from

255
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.299
quantum measurements. So we know that when we take

256
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:11.140
a quantum measurement, we get um if we repeat

257
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.099
the measurement, we, we might get different outcomes. But

258
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:18.099
we can, if we repeat the measurement enough times,

259
00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:21.229
we can map out the probabilities of those various

260
00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:24.700
outcomes. So we know that there's a certain amount

261
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.289
of chance, we know that there's a certain range

262
00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:30.460
of possibilities. We know that we don't always get

263
00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:37.219
the same possibility. And we know that um that

264
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.799
the uh results uh can only be precise for

265
00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:46.429
certain parameters that we, because of Eise Heisenberg's uncertainty

266
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.000
principle that we can't measure position pre precisely and

267
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.510
the momentum precisely at the same time. So these

268
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.559
are things we know the question is how to

269
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.559
explain it. And there are many different ways to

270
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.469
explain quantum measurement. Uh Similarly, we know that the

271
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:06.020
universe on the largest scale is very even very

272
00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.589
regular. If we look in one direction, we see

273
00:17:08.598 --> 00:17:11.560
pretty much the same number of Galaxies as in

274
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.699
the complete opposite direction. If we look and measure

275
00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:20.270
the cosmic radiation background, the temperature of it is

276
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.939
very, very close to the same in all directions,

277
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:26.618
there's slight variations. So the question is how do

278
00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:29.619
we get such uniformity. Is it just a coincidence

279
00:17:30.068 --> 00:17:34.538
or is there some reason that the universe smoothed

280
00:17:34.548 --> 00:17:37.139
out in the beginning that led to the idea

281
00:17:37.149 --> 00:17:41.229
of inflation? And then it turns out that inflation

282
00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:44.818
is pretty easy to produce in Einstein's general theory

283
00:17:44.828 --> 00:17:49.318
of relativity by just having the right energy configuration,

284
00:17:49.328 --> 00:17:53.939
the right energy set up. So um so Andre

285
00:17:53.949 --> 00:17:58.369
Linday, the Russian born um cosmologist who's now at

286
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.209
Stanford University, came up with the idea of an

287
00:18:01.219 --> 00:18:06.589
eternal inflation, which is that this happens repeatedly. But

288
00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:09.819
I should say that the idea of the multiverse

289
00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:15.300
really became popular when people started grappling with the

290
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.780
idea that the cosmological constant of the universe, which

291
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.660
is a anti kind of anti gravity parameter that's

292
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.439
causing the universe to slightly accelerate um over time

293
00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:36.060
um seems very large by one calculation, calculating the

294
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.189
quantum energy background. So if you look at empty

295
00:18:40.199 --> 00:18:44.810
space, it's not really empty, it has particles that

296
00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:47.800
are popping in and out of emptiness. And if

297
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.329
you add up the energy of all those particles,

298
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.579
you get something that could be called the cosmological

299
00:18:55.589 --> 00:18:58.800
constant. And let me explain what the cosmological constant

300
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.760
is. When Einstein developed his general theory of relativity,

301
00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:08.770
which is how space and time uh create gravity

302
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.000
through their curvature. He realized that he wasn't getting

303
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.300
stable results, he was getting results that would either

304
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.680
contract or expand. And it was when he developed

305
00:19:20.689 --> 00:19:25.119
that was, that was before hubble's um proof as

306
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.239
it turns out that the universe is expanding and

307
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.640
he thought he made a mistake. So he added

308
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.520
the cosmological constant as a stabilizing term, which kind

309
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.689
of pushes the universe outward to stabilize it against

310
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.910
gravity to make it a steady universe, a static

311
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.729
universe. But then uh he dropped that idea. He

312
00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:48.489
said it was a big mistake that he shouldn't

313
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.849
have even introduced it. But ideas tend to persist.

314
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:57.939
And in 1998 2 teams of cosmologists used um

315
00:19:57.949 --> 00:20:01.229
uh observations of the universe to show that not

316
00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:04.800
only is the universe expanding, it's accelerating in its

317
00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.479
expansion. So something is pushing it out faster and

318
00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:13.719
faster over time. And that must be something which

319
00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:16.959
sometimes is called dark energy. But you could also

320
00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:20.540
use a cosmological constant as a way of modeling

321
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.640
that dark dark energy that cosmological constant turns out

322
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.280
to be very, very small because if it were

323
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.099
big, it would have affected uh the development of

324
00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.819
stars Galaxies and so forth. It would have made

325
00:20:33.829 --> 00:20:38.319
it impossible for structure to form. So it's this

326
00:20:38.329 --> 00:20:43.829
really, really minute cosmological constant. So you don't feel

327
00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:47.640
it until billions of years into the history of

328
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.040
the universe. So the 1st 5 billion years of

329
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.069
so the history of the universe, you don't feel

330
00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:59.109
this anti gravity push and stars can form Galaxies

331
00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:02.969
form earth forms, everything forms just nice. But then

332
00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:05.500
later in the history of the universe, suddenly you

333
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.560
start feeling this outward push and the universe starts

334
00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:12.219
to speed up in its expansion because this cosmological

335
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:16.300
constant term is small. But people in quantum field

336
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:21.040
theory calculate the cosmological constant based on the energy

337
00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.219
of empty space. And they say it must be

338
00:21:23.229 --> 00:21:28.630
huge. So the question is why in reality, you

339
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.099
have a small cosmological constant. But really based on

340
00:21:33.109 --> 00:21:35.219
quantum field theory, you should have a large one.

341
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.400
And the answer that some people have is that

342
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.560
maybe the universe is really a multiverse and that

343
00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:46.880
you have all these expanding universes out there. And

344
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.829
each of them has its own cosmological constant and

345
00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:53.770
that some of them are enormous and some of

346
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:57.359
them are moderate. And we happen to be in

347
00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:59.719
an outlier, we happen to be in the very,

348
00:21:59.729 --> 00:22:05.319
very odd strange universe that has a tiny cosmological

349
00:22:05.329 --> 00:22:09.800
constant. So, um you know, so we are just

350
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.609
in this really bizarre universe that has a small

351
00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:16.989
cosmo cosmological constant. But it's lucky that we are

352
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.270
because that's the only way stars can form and

353
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.390
Galaxies can form and life can form. And that's

354
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.959
why we're here because we happen to be in

355
00:22:26.969 --> 00:22:30.300
a universe with a tiny cosmological constant and all

356
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.900
the other universes with the large cosmological constants never

357
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.739
formed structure. So there was no one there to

358
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.099
say, hey, we're in a universe with a large

359
00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:40.459
cosmological constant.

360
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.729
So you mentioned Einstein there and of course, if

361
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:50.349
theorize about the space time continuum and about 1/4

362
00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:55.630
dimension of reality. Does this idea of going above

363
00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.099
the three dimensions also connect in any way to

364
00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:02.900
the idea of the multiverse or not?

365
00:23:03.569 --> 00:23:07.380
Well, the idea of dimensions is very interesting. Uh

366
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.410
DIMENSIONS is a little bit of a strange concept

367
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.890
because we know that there are three tangible physical

368
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.699
dimensions. You know, if we, we can, you know,

369
00:23:19.709 --> 00:23:22.550
walk north and south, we can walk east and

370
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.180
west or we can jump up and down. Those

371
00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:28.910
are the three ways we can move. Uh So

372
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.020
those are the physical dimensions. But then at some

373
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.660
point, people started saying, even in the late 19th

374
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.579
century, that time has a quality that resembles a

375
00:23:40.589 --> 00:23:46.390
dimension. Uh BECAUSE uh you can imagine things changing

376
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.390
over time just like they might be different in

377
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.959
different directions in space. And that was idea was

378
00:23:53.969 --> 00:24:00.050
solidified. Uh When Herman Mankowski in 1907 said that

379
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.239
Einstein's special theory of relativity was best developed in

380
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.619
44 dimensions. And finally, after a few years of

381
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.140
saying, oh dimensions, four dimension is kind of an

382
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.859
abstract concept and not really liking it. Einstein adopted

383
00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:18.479
the fourth dimension and used it in his general

384
00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:23.880
theory of relativity. So that's pretty well accepted. But

385
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.699
around the time that Einstein proposed General Relativity, a

386
00:24:28.709 --> 00:24:34.260
phys, a mathematician uh Theodore Kaluza who was in

387
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.660
uh East Prussia and part of then part of

388
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.280
Germany, a German empire um wrote to Einstein and

389
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.959
said, hey, wait a minute, maybe you can add

390
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.489
another force to your theory, electricity and magnetism, which

391
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.170
we call electromagnetism by adding an extra dimension to

392
00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.209
your theory and having 1/5 dimension that uh we

393
00:24:58.219 --> 00:25:02.819
don't detect but still comes into the theory. So

394
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.420
that's the Kusa idea of the fifth dimension. And

395
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.390
later someone named Oscar Klein connected with qua quantum

396
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.640
physics. So now we call that Kusa Klein um

397
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.290
higher dimensional theory. And Klein proposed the idea that

398
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.880
the higher dimension was kind of curled up into

399
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.050
a very tight circle, kind of like if you

400
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.780
look at a piece of spaghetti or a piece

401
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.780
of pasta, and you look at not the long

402
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.310
part of it, but we look at the radius

403
00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:39.640
of it. It's very, very tiny. So if you

404
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.819
were observing a piece of spaghetti from a great

405
00:25:43.829 --> 00:25:47.010
distance, it would just look like a one dimensional

406
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.430
object, it would look like a straight line. You

407
00:25:49.439 --> 00:25:51.550
wouldn't be able to tell that it has a

408
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:57.069
thickness. And similarly in the uh Calusa Klein picture,

409
00:25:57.329 --> 00:26:00.680
um the higher dimension, the fifth dimension is curled

410
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:04.150
up so tightly into such a tight little circle

411
00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:07.369
that we never really detect it, that's impossible to

412
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:12.170
detect. Well, um if you look later in the

413
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.290
history of physics, string theory was developed starting in

414
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.010
the 19 eighties as this idea that particles are

415
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.339
not really particles, but they're energetic strands that are

416
00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:30.500
vibrating and their vibrations create the particle categories. But

417
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:36.939
mathematicians discovered that string theory does not mathematically make

418
00:26:36.949 --> 00:26:42.900
sense. It's mathematically inconsistent unless you put it into

419
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.530
a 10 dimensional theory at least. And so you

420
00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.800
need to add not just 1/5 dimension, but you

421
00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.099
need to add six more dimensions beyond space and

422
00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:57.750
time. So, uh so you have 10 dimensions. And

423
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.810
um in a related topic called Super Gravity, um

424
00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:07.589
people like Eugene Kremer and Bernard Julia in France

425
00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:12.660
developed the idea of spontaneous compact application. Um And

426
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.310
I think that was developed in the late 19

427
00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:19.729
seventies, this idea that um all the other dimensions

428
00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:22.989
would collapse and you would only see four of

429
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.609
the dimensions, but the other dimensions would just, you

430
00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:32.959
know, become crushed into something that's undetectable. And um

431
00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:38.439
other physicists found that there are many, many, many

432
00:27:38.449 --> 00:27:41.520
different ways that this collapse of the higher dimensions

433
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.790
can occur and many different possible geometries for the

434
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.780
higher dimension. Once it's collapsed, it turns out to

435
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:54.449
be 10 to the 500 power possibilities for this

436
00:27:54.459 --> 00:27:57.839
kind of collapse into 10 to the 500 power

437
00:27:57.849 --> 00:28:00.670
types of geometries. And you could think of those

438
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.709
geometries kind of like pretzels, not just rings but

439
00:28:05.719 --> 00:28:10.310
or doughnuts, but all these different twisty pretzels, you

440
00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:16.829
know, and imagine 10 with a 500 zeros possibilities.

441
00:28:17.219 --> 00:28:21.359
And each of these can lead to its own

442
00:28:21.729 --> 00:28:27.400
universe model its own physics. And um some physicists

443
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:32.439
talk about, you know, 10 to the 500 possible

444
00:28:32.449 --> 00:28:37.619
universes out there, each with its own um type

445
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:43.349
of what we call internal geometry. Um INTERNAL meaning

446
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.650
that you don't really see it as opposed to

447
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.030
external geometry. So that's another yet another idea of

448
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.589
the multiverse is that to try to explain why

449
00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:58.790
we're in one particular type of universe. But there's

450
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.550
all these other possibilities out there, 10 to the

451
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.680
500 other possibilities out there, which is very, very

452
00:29:05.689 --> 00:29:09.290
perplexing. And that's how dimensions comes into the picture

453
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.819
of the multiverse models.

454
00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:18.449
And so these universes with different configurations. WW should

455
00:29:18.459 --> 00:29:21.569
we expect them to also have different laws of

456
00:29:21.579 --> 00:29:22.329
physics?

457
00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:29.109
Yes. So they would have uh not necessarily uh

458
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.920
super different laws like you might like, you might

459
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.050
think if you know naively physics, you say, OK,

460
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.430
force equals mass times acceleration, something you learn in

461
00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:43.050
basic physics. And then, you know, you wouldn't have

462
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.630
like force is mass to the third power at

463
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.020
times acceleration hub, but you might have uh different

464
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:55.449
constants strength constants for the forces. So we have

465
00:29:55.459 --> 00:29:59.920
all these parameters in physics which tell you how

466
00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:04.319
strong, how strongly particles can interact with each other.

467
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.160
So for example, uh if you have, you know,

468
00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:14.400
two magnets like two refrigerator magnets or bar magnets,

469
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.530
and you hold them 1 m away from each

470
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.810
other, you know how strong the attraction will be.

471
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.569
Well, maybe in another universe, they would have a

472
00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:26.849
much stronger attraction to each other. Maybe in a

473
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:29.300
third universe, they have a much weaker attraction to

474
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:33.369
each other. So, in one universe, like, you might

475
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.310
have a refrigerator and you wanna put a magnet

476
00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:40.790
on the refrigerator, you know, with your favorite football

477
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.040
team or something like that, you put it on

478
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.329
the refrigerator and it just never sticks because the

479
00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:49.140
magnets are never strong enough. And then another universe,

480
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.439
you get, um, a magnet for your favorite football

481
00:30:52.449 --> 00:30:55.180
team. You put on a refrigerator and then that

482
00:30:55.189 --> 00:30:59.060
football team does terribly like they keep, you know,

483
00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:02.319
uh losing like, oh, I, I'm gonna support another

484
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:04.540
football team. You try to take the first magnet

485
00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.319
off, but it's impossible because it's stuck on there

486
00:31:07.329 --> 00:31:11.420
forever because the magnetism is so strong. So, you

487
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.300
know, we're lucky, we're in a universe where you

488
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.660
can take refrigerator magnets on and off and they'll

489
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.239
stick as long as you want to. But then

490
00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.719
if you wanna take them off, you can take

491
00:31:21.729 --> 00:31:22.349
them off.

492
00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:26.719
But let me just ask you 11 more question

493
00:31:26.729 --> 00:31:32.319
about uh dimension. So, is it possible in any

494
00:31:32.329 --> 00:31:37.869
way to, I mean, to test that out empirically,

495
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.489
to detect them empirically or, or is this something

496
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.640
that we just are able to figure out mathematically

497
00:31:47.189 --> 00:31:52.750
well with these unseen dimensions? Um The whole theory

498
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.689
is designed so that these dimensions would be undetectable.

499
00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:59.569
But then of course, people will say, well, then

500
00:31:59.579 --> 00:32:02.069
how do you prove it? Well, then you try

501
00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:04.829
to look for what's called, what are called low

502
00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:11.130
energy ramifications So string theory operates, it lives on

503
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.939
a very, very high energy scale. So um if

504
00:32:14.949 --> 00:32:18.229
you um if, if you want to see string

505
00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:22.349
theory, you know, don't know, don't really uh have

506
00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:26.189
the possibility of creating uh colliders on earth or

507
00:32:26.199 --> 00:32:28.579
even in the solar system that would be strong

508
00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:32.060
enough to produce those ultra high energies. But then

509
00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:35.170
people say, well, maybe you can see a slight

510
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.479
change in the results due to the higher dimensions.

511
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.569
So there are theories that predict you would see

512
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.449
a slight difference in the outcome of a collision

513
00:32:49.459 --> 00:32:53.030
experiment due to the fact that there are more

514
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:56.400
dimensions in space. So those are the things people

515
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.369
are trying to test for these subtle differences. And

516
00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.189
so far, these haven't been found. Um THAT would

517
00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:06.540
be Nobel Prize winning material. If you could show

518
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.599
that a collision experiment, you get a difference that's

519
00:33:09.609 --> 00:33:13.579
significant enough to show that some of the energy,

520
00:33:13.589 --> 00:33:15.880
for example, escaped into a higher dimension.

521
00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:20.250
And when it comes to the origins of our

522
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.599
own universe and the Big Bang, which is something

523
00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:29.489
you referred to earlier. I mean, what is the

524
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.510
most accepted uh explanation for the origins of our

525
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.930
universe or the way that the Big Bang occurred

526
00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:39.729
or played

527
00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:46.380
out? So, um physicists, most physicists don't talk about

528
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:50.800
what happens before the Big Bang because um as

529
00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:54.920
people like Stephen Hawking proved in the 19 sixties,

530
00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:58.459
the actual Big Bang event would be a singularity

531
00:33:58.699 --> 00:34:03.040
So nothing would be detective before then. Now that

532
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.839
said there are other theories about cosmic cycles that

533
00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:11.447
there were other cycles of creation. But the standard

534
00:34:11.458 --> 00:34:15.309
Big Bang theory is that it's a singularity that

535
00:34:15.509 --> 00:34:19.638
time began essentially at that point. So we can't

536
00:34:19.648 --> 00:34:22.589
really talk about before the Big Bang. And then

537
00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:27.128
space came into existence during the time of the

538
00:34:27.138 --> 00:34:31.309
Big Bang time came to existence and then the

539
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:38.250
universe immediately began expanding. But then um at this

540
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.510
point, there was a certain amount of energy in

541
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.500
the universe, a certain amount of energy background. And

542
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:48.770
one thing um that was found in the early

543
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.060
universe is something with a technical name. It's called

544
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:56.478
a scalar field. And a scalar field sounds like,

545
00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.429
you know, something very mathematical. But in reality, it

546
00:35:00.439 --> 00:35:04.189
just means that you have a map of energy

547
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.540
that's different from point to point. Kind of like

548
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.270
if you were going mountain climbing and you wanted

549
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.810
to find out which were the highest peaks which

550
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.179
were the lowest peaks. And what would be the

551
00:35:17.189 --> 00:35:19.530
best way to climb up a mountain? You might

552
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.699
have a topographical map and that topographical map would

553
00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:27.810
tell you the elevation at every point. So it

554
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.610
might say, OK, this point is 500 m high.

555
00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:36.330
This point is 1000 m high. This point is

556
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.689
more, this point is less and then you can

557
00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:43.449
plan your walk and your hike um up the

558
00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:47.489
mountain based on the topographical map. Well, if you

559
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.889
look at the early universe right after the Big

560
00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:54.449
Bang, you could map out its energy and that

561
00:35:54.459 --> 00:35:57.560
would give you what we call a scalar field.

562
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:02.379
And if that energy has a certain profile, meaning

563
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.820
it has a certain level, um and that level

564
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.870
persists for a while and slowly changes over time,

565
00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:20.060
then that, that bump in energy um causes expansion

566
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.489
super rapid expansion at that particular point in space.

567
00:36:24.729 --> 00:36:29.340
So if you have a certain energy profile, that's,

568
00:36:29.379 --> 00:36:33.100
that's flat for a certain period of time, meaning

569
00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:35.540
it would be kind of like you have, you

570
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.040
know, uh you climb up a mountain and then

571
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:42.379
you have this flat plateau where things are pretty

572
00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:47.649
much level that triggers the universe space in the

573
00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:50.939
universe to start expanding really rapidly. It's just a

574
00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:55.669
result of Einstein's general theory of relativity which says

575
00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:59.080
that space expands depending upon what's in it, what

576
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.830
mass is in it, what energy is in it.

577
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.469
So space starts to expand rapidly that stretches out

578
00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:07.889
that part of the universe and that's called inflation

579
00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:14.030
and that happens super rapidly. And suddenly when um

580
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.570
when things uh expand enough, um the universe no

581
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.810
longer um sits in that energy zone that, that

582
00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.659
it it it's no longer subject to that scalar

583
00:37:29.669 --> 00:37:34.850
energy field um which, which has evolved slowly over

584
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:41.090
time. Um And that you no longer have inflationary

585
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.139
period, that enormous amount of energy created by that

586
00:37:45.149 --> 00:37:49.669
super rapid expansion turns into all these particles. So

587
00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:52.870
all the particles that we see today, you know,

588
00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:57.399
light particles called photons, the particles we know as

589
00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:02.969
electrons the quarks. And this whole zoo of particles

590
00:38:02.979 --> 00:38:06.510
is created at the exact moment that inflation stops.

591
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:11.229
And all this energy turns into matter. Uh FOLLOWING

592
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.540
E equals MC squared energy is matter times the

593
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.360
speed of light squared as Einstein said, so then

594
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.979
that's when the the physical universe with all of

595
00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:27.149
the particles is created. But as Andre Linde said,

596
00:38:27.429 --> 00:38:30.449
um this might happen in other parts of the

597
00:38:30.459 --> 00:38:35.310
early cosmos creating other inflationary events and other universes.

598
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.189
And that's where you get the multiverse picture. Mhm

599
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.919
So I I mean, is that idea that we

600
00:38:43.929 --> 00:38:50.679
sometimes see or read about in popular science publications

601
00:38:50.689 --> 00:38:55.189
uh where I mean, if a uni if a

602
00:38:55.199 --> 00:39:00.699
multiverse is real, it is usually depicted visually as

603
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.669
different uh bubbles or different spheres. And then uh

604
00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:09.429
we read that uh basically what could have happened

605
00:39:09.439 --> 00:39:13.189
is that two of them or perhaps even more

606
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.060
collide with and when they collide they create a

607
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.399
new universe or they provoke what would be a

608
00:39:20.409 --> 00:39:24.879
big bang? And the a new universe uh is

609
00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:27.780
created from that, I mean, does that have uh

610
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.030
any support in actual physics or not?

611
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:39.540
Well, there are ideas of higher dimensional planes called

612
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.120
membranes or brains for short colliding along a higher

613
00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:47.830
dimension. That's a different idea that was proposed by

614
00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:52.760
Neil Turret Paul Steinhardt and others uh around uh

615
00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:58.179
2000. And uh that's called a cyclic cosmology. And

616
00:39:58.189 --> 00:40:02.709
that's an alternative to inflation and inflation, the bubbles

617
00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.969
expand and they could collide. But when they collide,

618
00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:09.389
they don't really create a new universe, they create,

619
00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:13.850
maybe create a little scar. So when two universes

620
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.689
collide, they might create some disruption in matter and

621
00:40:18.699 --> 00:40:24.860
energy and that theoretically could be seen in a

622
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:28.449
uh kind of rings scar like rings in the

623
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:32.189
cosmic microwave background. And scientists are trying to look

624
00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:38.040
for these rings that are relics of early collisions

625
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:42.110
between us and another universe. So that is one

626
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.439
way of trying to uh physically prove the existence

627
00:40:46.449 --> 00:40:50.600
of a multiverse. So um in, in my book,

628
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:56.040
I talked interviewed Jana P Pols who's uh who's

629
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.360
a researcher at the University of London, who uh

630
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:03.250
her team is trying to look for uh evidence

631
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.760
of of bubble collisions in the early universe. And

632
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:10.889
also their latest project is to try to simulate

633
00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:14.500
this computationally and do

634
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:19.739
black holes connect in any way to the multiverse

635
00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:20.560
or not?

636
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.260
Well, there is a theory um by Lise Mullen,

637
00:41:25.729 --> 00:41:32.330
uh a physicist that um black holes uh they,

638
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.280
they, they are known to be extreme events in

639
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.610
the universe. And um I if you look at

640
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.489
um uh standard general relativity, we say that the

641
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.969
more mass you have concentrated in a point, the

642
00:41:47.979 --> 00:41:51.739
more space time warps. Well, for black holes, you

643
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:56.669
have an infinite warping. So it creates what can

644
00:41:56.679 --> 00:42:00.479
look like a tear or a hole in the

645
00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:04.879
fabric of space time. And um there are ways

646
00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:10.330
to mathematically connect the black hole with another part

647
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.949
of space and create a kind of a um

648
00:42:15.219 --> 00:42:17.530
you know, what could be a connection with another

649
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.850
part of our universe. And some speculate that it

650
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.120
could create a new universe uh like uh as

651
00:42:25.129 --> 00:42:28.229
Lise Mullen called it a baby universe and that

652
00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:31.590
this baby universe could grow up into a big

653
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.810
universe and then create more black holes. And he

654
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.199
has this idea of survival of the fittest where

655
00:42:38.209 --> 00:42:42.000
the universe that creates the most black holes is

656
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:46.669
evolutionary fitter than other universes because uh it also

657
00:42:46.679 --> 00:42:51.149
creates um more stars and more planets and more,

658
00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.810
more likelihood for life. So that's a really interesting

659
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.989
idea, but that's not really the thrust of uh

660
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.870
most researchers who do, who study the multiverse as

661
00:43:02.879 --> 00:43:05.270
more of an idea of, of one researcher

662
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:11.280
and does the science and philosophy of counter factuals

663
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.699
uh have anything to do with the idea of

664
00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:15.669
a multiverse.

665
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:22.669
Well, yes. Uh So in philosophy, we can speculate

666
00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:27.510
upon all the possibilities that are out there. And

667
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.209
uh that was, you know, done all the way

668
00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:36.350
back to people like philosophers like Leibnitz. So Leibnitz

669
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:41.610
talked about all the possible universes out there that

670
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.489
he, he talked about the divine or God thinking

671
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:51.820
about all these other possibilities. But of course, God

672
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:55.320
is uh as, as he would say, perfect in

673
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.870
his wisdom and chose from all these among these

674
00:43:59.879 --> 00:44:04.959
other possibilities, the best possibility for us, the best

675
00:44:04.969 --> 00:44:09.189
of all possible worlds. But he imagined all these

676
00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:12.550
other worlds out there, you know, where earth was

677
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.989
brutally hot and unpleasant and you know, food was

678
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:23.060
unappetizing and people were, you know, uh you know,

679
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.360
these unthinking beings. But in his wisdom, he said,

680
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:33.040
OK, we want a world which is pleasant, as

681
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:37.750
nice climate, as nice oceans. And as people who

682
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.830
are kind of a little bit like, you know,

683
00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.169
a little bit like the divine because they can

684
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.969
make choices and so forth. So Leibniz kind of

685
00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:49.199
talked about this idea of the best of all

686
00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:54.689
possible worlds. And the writer, uh Voltaire famously satirized

687
00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:59.189
this idea with his character Candide. Uh So as

688
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:01.810
this novel Candide, where he had a character named

689
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.310
Pangloss who was a philosopher who would no matter

690
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.610
what happened, there could be an earthquake. Um In

691
00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.770
fact, I think he talked about the, the great

692
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.169
earthquake in Lisbon and uh you know, it's horrible

693
00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:19.050
earthquake. And he said, well, you know, it must

694
00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.550
be the best possibility because God meant us to

695
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.659
be in the best of all possible worlds. So

696
00:45:24.669 --> 00:45:26.719
even if, even if you know where there's all

697
00:45:26.729 --> 00:45:30.149
this suffering, it still works out for the best.

698
00:45:30.169 --> 00:45:33.729
And uh Voltaire thought that was very amusing that

699
00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:37.010
a philosopher would say anything is, is always the

700
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.010
best outcome. Mhm

701
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.080
So one of the questions that you also explore

702
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:47.040
in the book is how explaining why the universe

703
00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:51.850
is habitable uh uh as something to do with

704
00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.520
the idea of the multiverse. So what's the connection

705
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.250
there or the possible connection?

706
00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:01.840
Well, this was an idea called the Anthropic Principle

707
00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:05.709
developed by Brandon Carter who was someone who was

708
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:09.830
at Cambridge. He, he was a friend of Stephen

709
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.870
Hawking. And uh you know, Cambridge was this really

710
00:46:14.879 --> 00:46:19.290
hot area for cosmology. It still is. But in

711
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:23.870
the 19 seventies, uh Cambridge and Princeton were two

712
00:46:23.879 --> 00:46:26.699
of the best places to go in Princeton. You

713
00:46:26.709 --> 00:46:30.070
had uh John Wheeler in Cambridge, you had people

714
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.750
like Hawking and Penrose and Brandon Carter was also

715
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.860
there. And Carter also spent some time at Princeton.

716
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.290
So we got to know John Wheeler and he

717
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.389
found out about Hugh Everett's uh idea of the

718
00:46:44.399 --> 00:46:49.580
many worlds interpretation. So that got Brandon Carter thinking

719
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.330
about the multiverse, although it wasn't called as such.

720
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:58.030
And he thought, well, there's all these questions, cosmology

721
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.520
about uh parameters like why certain physical parameters should

722
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:05.520
have certain values. And that's called the fine tuning

723
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:11.020
problem. Because if the strength of electromagnetism was different,

724
00:47:11.389 --> 00:47:15.699
you wouldn't have uh you know, for example, atoms,

725
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:20.169
you know, being stable. If you had, for example,

726
00:47:20.179 --> 00:47:23.060
the charge of a proton being slightly different than

727
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.570
a charge of electron, then you know, the atoms

728
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.850
would collapse. So there are all these coincidences in

729
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.209
the universe, things that um if you change slightly,

730
00:47:35.429 --> 00:47:39.959
the universe would not be suitable for life. And

731
00:47:39.969 --> 00:47:41.800
Brendan Carter said, hey, wait a minute, what if

732
00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:45.354
there's all these other units versus out there where

733
00:47:45.364 --> 00:47:50.304
things are different? But the fact that our universe

734
00:47:50.314 --> 00:47:56.935
eventually leads to stable planets, um thriving stars and

735
00:47:56.945 --> 00:48:01.564
um life and, and particularly intelligent life that can

736
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:06.290
talk about the universe. Uh Maybe that restricts this

737
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.250
range of possibilities down to one universe. And they

738
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:15.939
call that the anthropic principle for the Latin anthroposophy

739
00:48:15.989 --> 00:48:25.600
and some others said, well, maybe that term is

740
00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.169
a little bit misleading because you don't just need

741
00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:32.580
people, you just need stability, stable, stable planets and

742
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:36.820
life. Um You could have other beings um observe

743
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:41.199
it. But um but anyway, that's uh one idea

744
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:44.489
of the multiverse is uh this idea of the

745
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.399
anthropic principle and it explains why um you have

746
00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:51.959
a universe that supports habitable worlds

747
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.679
and does the idea of the multiverse connect in

748
00:48:56.689 --> 00:49:01.310
any way to a potential theory of everything or

749
00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:06.189
a simple unified explanation of the natural forces.

750
00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.649
Well, um this is what we call the holy

751
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:14.469
grail of physics or the ultimate goal of physics

752
00:49:14.479 --> 00:49:18.050
is to create a theory that unites all of

753
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.649
the natural forces into a single simple set of

754
00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:27.100
equations. And uh it's an elusive goal because um

755
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:31.379
we made great progress in uh the 19 sixties

756
00:49:31.389 --> 00:49:35.600
and 19 seventies with developing the Standard Model and

757
00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:39.959
the standard model includes the electro weak unification, which

758
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.159
very, very nicely unites electromagnetism with the weak force.

759
00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:47.870
The weak force is the force that explains radioactivity.

760
00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:53.379
And of course, electromagnetism explains why charges uh attract

761
00:49:53.389 --> 00:49:56.610
to repel and why magnets attract to repel. All

762
00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.050
of those can be explained with a single theory

763
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.449
that is also uh consistent with quantum physics and

764
00:50:04.459 --> 00:50:09.370
it's very, very accurate. So electro weak uh predictions

765
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.620
are as accurate as any experiment that's been ever

766
00:50:13.629 --> 00:50:17.360
been done. So it's extremely successful. Now, we also

767
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:22.629
have the strong nuclear force which explains why atomic

768
00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:27.149
nuclei are stable. And there's a theory for that

769
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:31.770
called quantum chromodynamics, which is a very, very successful

770
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:38.560
theory. Um And um it's not as well tested,

771
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:42.050
I should say as electro weak, but it also

772
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.979
has very similar properties to electro week and involves

773
00:50:45.989 --> 00:50:50.500
this idea of uh two types of, of entities.

774
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:55.840
One is the matter particles quarks, electrons and so

775
00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.550
forth. And then you have force carrying particles which

776
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:05.780
are particles that are um conveyed from one particle

777
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.500
ma matter particle to another. So they're exchanged just

778
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:14.800
like throwing a ball to matter particles, throw in

779
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:19.139
a sense, a force uh carrier back and forth

780
00:51:19.149 --> 00:51:22.179
and that creates a force. So you have uh

781
00:51:22.189 --> 00:51:25.169
a, a bunch of force carriers, you have photons

782
00:51:25.179 --> 00:51:30.169
which carry electromagnetic force, you have the WW particle

783
00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:32.969
and Z particles which carry the weak force and

784
00:51:32.979 --> 00:51:36.010
you have gluons which carry the strong force. Now,

785
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:40.810
in principle, we should have gravity should be described

786
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.080
using a force carrying particle which some people have

787
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.669
called graviton. But no one has successfully developed a

788
00:51:48.679 --> 00:51:54.129
quantum theory of gravitation that is uh testable and

789
00:51:54.139 --> 00:51:58.209
describes, you know what we measure in the universe.

790
00:51:58.219 --> 00:52:00.120
There are a lot of ideas out there for

791
00:52:00.129 --> 00:52:04.300
quantum gravitation and then the theory of everything would

792
00:52:04.719 --> 00:52:08.989
describe quantum gravity in a way that's consistent with

793
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.300
all the other forces and unify all those into

794
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:16.350
a quantum theory of all particles and all forces.

795
00:52:16.709 --> 00:52:21.199
And the leading candidate for that is string theory.

796
00:52:21.379 --> 00:52:24.459
But as I mentioned, uh string theory has all

797
00:52:24.469 --> 00:52:30.739
these possibilities, 10 to the 500 string uh geometries.

798
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.729
And each of those creates its own uh theory

799
00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:38.419
of physics of and leads to a diff different

800
00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:41.830
parameters for the Standard model. So those need to

801
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.669
be significantly narrowed down to create a theory of

802
00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:49.149
everything where the multiverse comes into play is you

803
00:52:49.159 --> 00:52:53.429
can say, OK, there's all these possibilities out there,

804
00:52:53.439 --> 00:52:57.300
there's all these theories out there. But the theory

805
00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:01.790
of everything that happens to correspond to our universe

806
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.090
was narrowed down by the fact that we are

807
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.209
here using the anthropic principle, we can say, well,

808
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.179
there are many, many, many, many different theories of

809
00:53:12.189 --> 00:53:17.340
everything, but there's one that matches a universe that

810
00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:21.449
creates planets that creates stars, creates intelligent life. And

811
00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:25.520
that's our particular theory of everything. And that's you

812
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.320
know why we have these particular parameters, different strengths

813
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:34.129
of different constants. And that in, in, in theory,

814
00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:39.379
narrows everything down to one universe and explains why

815
00:53:39.389 --> 00:53:43.020
we are living in this one universe and explains,

816
00:53:43.239 --> 00:53:45.989
you know, all the constants for our universe. Well,

817
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.389
we're very, very far from that. That's kind of

818
00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:52.610
an idealization. That's the goal, but no one has

819
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.070
ever come up with a way to narrow everything

820
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.729
down to one possibility. But

821
00:53:59.739 --> 00:54:05.229
what are perhaps the main difficulties with integrating gravity

822
00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:11.310
with quantum physics? What are the bigger obstacles there?

823
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:17.800
Well, the biggest obstacle is mathematical um so back

824
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:23.030
in the 19 forties, um physicists such as Richard

825
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:29.790
Feynman, Julian Schwinger and Si Tiro Tomonaga in Japan

826
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:36.100
developed what are called uh renormalization methods in quantum

827
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.199
electrodynamics. Now that is a very technical term, but

828
00:54:40.209 --> 00:54:45.070
basically what that means is that you can take

829
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:50.270
two electrons which are char basic charge particles. And

830
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:54.870
you say, OK, let's develop a quantum theory of

831
00:54:54.879 --> 00:54:59.510
how these electrons interact with each other. And the

832
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.780
way they interact with each other is by exchanging

833
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.070
a light particle called a photon. And then you

834
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.439
say, OK, you have an electron gives off a

835
00:55:10.449 --> 00:55:15.139
photon, that photon is absorbed by another electron. And

836
00:55:15.149 --> 00:55:18.860
then that electron acquires a certain amount of energy

837
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.540
acquires a certain amount of momentum. And then you

838
00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:25.370
could predict the ways where the electron will end

839
00:55:25.379 --> 00:55:29.090
up. And that's called scattering scattering is when you

840
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.860
have two particles, you predict, you know where they

841
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.169
end up what angles, what's the probability they'll end

842
00:55:36.179 --> 00:55:38.459
up at certain angles. And that's something you can

843
00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:42.729
physically measure the scattering, you physically measure where these

844
00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:46.719
particles end up. You test test it according to

845
00:55:46.729 --> 00:55:52.149
theory. And in the 19 forties, quantum electrodynamics showed

846
00:55:52.159 --> 00:55:56.070
how you can add up all the possible ways

847
00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.709
electrons interact and using something called Feynman diagrams, which

848
00:56:01.719 --> 00:56:04.360
is a neat way of adding up all the

849
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:12.500
possibilities. And then using mathematical methods, get rid of

850
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:16.840
infinite terms that pop up. So if you do

851
00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:24.050
these calculations with particles, because particles are infinitesimal, they

852
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:30.370
really elementary particles are not only tiny, but they're

853
00:56:30.379 --> 00:56:34.500
believed in this theory to be, you know, mathematically

854
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:38.229
have zero size. So if you put that into

855
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:42.389
the theory, you get infinite terms because one divided

856
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:47.840
by zero is infinity um or unlimited. So what

857
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:51.340
during these calculations before a five inch ring or

858
00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:54.590
Toman NAA, they found these infinite terms, but they

859
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.550
were able to use a method called renormalization which

860
00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:03.209
basically matches terms, subtracts them so that you get

861
00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.909
rid of all the infinite terms. And that's renormalization.

862
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:09.219
And when electro the weak theory was developed in

863
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.760
19 sixties and 19 seventies, it was shown that

864
00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:15.870
you could also match up terms, subtract them out

865
00:57:16.219 --> 00:57:20.639
and then get um get uh a a finite

866
00:57:20.919 --> 00:57:24.530
amount. And I use a nice analogy in my

867
00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:30.820
book about um how renormalization works? I imagine a

868
00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:36.090
couple two people and they're living together and one

869
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.570
of them earns money and every week gets a

870
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.189
paycheck and she adds up all the money she

871
00:57:43.199 --> 00:57:47.199
earns o throughout a lifetime. And she imagines that

872
00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:50.870
she, she lives indefinitely. Um It's just a hypothetical.

873
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:54.709
So would make an infinite amount of money. And

874
00:57:54.719 --> 00:58:00.219
the other person is spending each, each month and

875
00:58:00.229 --> 00:58:03.169
the spending would be infinite. And if you say,

876
00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:06.479
hey, wait a minute, this doesn't add up in

877
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:11.459
the bookkeeping infinite income, but an infinite amount of

878
00:58:11.469 --> 00:58:14.620
spending, that doesn't make any sense. But if you

879
00:58:14.629 --> 00:58:18.260
say, OK, every month, one person brings in the

880
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:22.290
paycheck, the other person spends it and that creates

881
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.620
a finite amount each month. So that so therefore

882
00:58:26.629 --> 00:58:29.939
everything matches up in the in the bookkeeping. So

883
00:58:29.949 --> 00:58:32.860
the accounting works out similarly, you can do in

884
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.820
a kind of accounting in particle physics with electromagnetism

885
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:39.020
and the weak force in which everything gives you

886
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:42.250
a finite result. Well, it turns out with gravity,

887
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.219
you try to do this and you don't get,

888
00:58:45.399 --> 00:58:49.330
you can't match up the terms you keep getting

889
00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.379
infinite answers. And the only way around it as

890
00:58:53.389 --> 00:58:57.850
far as physicists can tell is to say, there's

891
00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:02.790
no such thing as infinite decimal that every particle

892
00:59:02.969 --> 00:59:06.540
must have a finite size. And that leads to

893
00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:11.409
the idea of finite strands which are known as

894
00:59:11.419 --> 00:59:15.699
strings at that vibrate instead of particles. So that

895
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:19.389
leads to string theory. And string theory is finite

896
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:22.350
So you don't get infinite number of uh you

897
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.219
know, get infinite terms. But then um you have

898
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.120
all these possibilities for string theory. So you have

899
00:59:29.129 --> 00:59:31.820
to narrow things down. So that's the problem with

900
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.449
string theory of so many options.

901
00:59:35.629 --> 00:59:39.159
So earlier, I've asked you about the Big Bang

902
00:59:39.169 --> 00:59:43.010
and the origins of our universe. But how about

903
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:47.050
the future of our universe? What are perhaps the

904
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.489
main hypothesis that physicists have proposed for the future

905
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.879
of our universe? And is it that one of

906
00:59:55.889 --> 00:59:59.239
them has more support than the others? I mean,

907
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.699
basically, what do we know at this point about

908
01:00:02.709 --> 01:00:04.270
the possible future of our

909
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.860
universe? Well, until the 19 nineties, um you know,

910
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.320
I should say between the 19, late, late 19

911
01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:18.550
twenties or 19 thirties and 19 nineties, the basic

912
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.280
idea was that the universe had three options. One

913
01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:28.050
of them is that expands and then um eventually

914
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:34.850
collapses. And then the second possibility is that expands

915
01:00:35.149 --> 01:00:38.409
and the expansion slows down but slows down very

916
01:00:38.419 --> 01:00:42.250
gradually. And the expansion keeps going. And the third

917
01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.860
option was kind of in between the two that

918
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:50.750
the universe al almost collapses, not quite collapses and

919
01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.770
keeps slowing down and slowing down, but never quite

920
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.850
collapses. But then in 1998 these two teams of

921
01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:04.409
astronomers discovered using measurements of exploding stars or supernova

922
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.300
that the universe is speeding up in its expansion.

923
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:12.260
And that's called cosmic acceleration. And that means that

924
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:15.530
you have 1/4 option, which is that the universe

925
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.100
will keep expanding forever, but not only that, but

926
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.780
will speed up in its expansion. And eventually just

927
01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.959
everything will just keep getting more and more dilute

928
01:01:28.439 --> 01:01:31.500
and that Galaxies will get further and further apart.

929
01:01:31.959 --> 01:01:35.979
And then finally, our set of Galaxies will be

930
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.139
a hermit, meaning like a loner in, in the

931
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:43.620
universe and we won't even see any other Galaxies,

932
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.949
we'll only see our galaxy and maybe a few

933
01:01:46.959 --> 01:01:51.330
others in the vicinity. And uh that is called

934
01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:56.120
the sometimes called a big whimper scenario uh from

935
01:01:56.129 --> 01:02:00.639
the Ts Elliot Poe poem. Um THAT you know

936
01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:02.699
how's the world ends? Not with a bang, but

937
01:02:02.709 --> 01:02:05.850
with a whimper. Um IT'S a line from Matthias

938
01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:11.379
Elliott poem. But um there's an even scarier uh

939
01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:15.739
possibility called The Big Rip. And that is that

940
01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:21.570
um whatever is, is causing acceleration keeps getting stronger

941
01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:25.580
and stronger. And then eventually everything is ripped apart,

942
01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:30.889
including planets are torn apart, stars are torn apart

943
01:02:30.909 --> 01:02:34.429
and even the atoms in people's bodies are torn

944
01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:37.469
apart. So everything is torn to shreds and that

945
01:02:37.479 --> 01:02:41.709
will be the end of the universe. Now, those

946
01:02:41.719 --> 01:02:45.409
are some possibilities in the standard model of, of

947
01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:49.870
cosmology. But then if you believe in cyclic universes,

948
01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:53.399
I believe in, um for example, the idea of

949
01:02:53.409 --> 01:02:59.199
Steinhardt and Turek that the universe is um uh

950
01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:04.929
cyclical because you have uh two membranes also known

951
01:03:04.939 --> 01:03:08.610
as brains colliding with each other periodically and clashing

952
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.370
with each other. Um There would be a periodic

953
01:03:12.379 --> 01:03:17.389
phase in which these two like, it's like hyper

954
01:03:17.399 --> 01:03:20.550
planes or planes in a higher dimension, collide with

955
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.689
each other, wipe everything out and reset the universe.

956
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.120
And that would be um the end of everything,

957
01:03:28.209 --> 01:03:30.229
but that would start a new phase of the

958
01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:35.570
universe. And then finally, there's Roger Penrose idea, a

959
01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.989
different kind of cycle where at the end of

960
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.399
the universe, there's emptiness, everything becomes more and more

961
01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:48.719
dilute all the particles uh evaporate. And then eventually

962
01:03:48.729 --> 01:03:53.229
you have sheer emptiness, but that emptiness um has

963
01:03:53.239 --> 01:03:58.090
a kind of identity crisis and it mathematically and

964
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.459
instead of thinking of itself is very large, it

965
01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:04.830
thinks of itself as very small and there's just

966
01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.320
mathematical transition and then creates a new phase of

967
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:10.959
the universe. So you have a new cycle. So

968
01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:14.159
those are some of the ideas about the end

969
01:04:14.169 --> 01:04:18.750
of time and you know, either destruction and recreation

970
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.850
of the universe or just the destruction of the

971
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.479
universe.

972
01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:25.570
And is there or I I mean, what is

973
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:31.129
the likelihood that whatever kind of scenario will occur

974
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:37.129
and the universe will still be able to sustain

975
01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:41.000
life and perhaps even worse uh being able to

976
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:45.050
sustain intelligent life like us?

977
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.209
Well, so, so we, we believe in, in, you

978
01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:55.179
know, the current standard cosmology that the universe is

979
01:04:55.189 --> 01:05:00.479
expanding faster and faster. And that um but also

980
01:05:00.489 --> 01:05:03.870
that something called entropy, which is a measure of

981
01:05:03.879 --> 01:05:08.840
disorderly energy is increasing. And that means that stars

982
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:13.110
will eventually burn out and the sun will eventually

983
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.229
die if the sun dies. We imagine that maybe

984
01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:19.870
we have spaceships that take us to another star,

985
01:05:20.469 --> 01:05:23.070
but then that star might die. So then we

986
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.959
go to a third star and we keep going

987
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.610
and uh maybe all the stars in our galaxy

988
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.689
die. And maybe we have, you know, uh not

989
01:05:33.699 --> 01:05:37.899
only interstellar travel but intergalactic travel, we try another

990
01:05:37.909 --> 01:05:43.989
galaxy, but eventually all of these Galaxies stars will

991
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:50.699
either um you know, become uh so cold, they,

992
01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:55.070
they can't support life or turn into black holes

993
01:05:55.139 --> 01:05:59.949
and so forth. So then the question is, can

994
01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:05.489
intelligent life survive? And that was answered um at

995
01:06:05.649 --> 01:06:09.989
one point by Roger Penrose who speculated that maybe

996
01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:16.189
we will develop ways to transform our uh intelligence,

997
01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:21.590
our consciousness into maybe, um you know, artificial intelligence

998
01:06:21.959 --> 01:06:24.790
or robots and that could live in under very,

999
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.439
very cold circumstances. But I'm not sure if that

1000
01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:31.129
would be quite as satisfying to say that life

1001
01:06:31.139 --> 01:06:35.469
would be in these robots that, you know, exist

1002
01:06:35.479 --> 01:06:38.580
in, in, in ultra cold temperatures. It's not the

1003
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.409
kind of life that we, that most people would

1004
01:06:41.419 --> 01:06:42.120
want to live.

1005
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.959
Yeah, for sure. And uh if a multiverse is

1006
01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:51.280
real, would it have any bearing on the future

1007
01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:53.040
of our own universe?

1008
01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:58.479
Uh Well, we, if the multiverse, the cosmological multiverse

1009
01:06:58.489 --> 01:07:04.620
is real, um unless uh there's some collision with

1010
01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:08.780
another universe that happens to hit our part of

1011
01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:12.350
the observable universe, probably it wouldn't affect us very

1012
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.570
much. We would just know that there are other

1013
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.679
universes out there that might have different fates than

1014
01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:24.209
our universe. Uh So, uh might not, might not

1015
01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:28.409
affect us very much. Um IN terms of the

1016
01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:34.909
quantum multiverse of the many worlds possibility, um It's

1017
01:07:34.919 --> 01:07:40.370
possible that we would have other versions of ourselves

1018
01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:45.659
that might have slightly different um fates in life.

1019
01:07:46.189 --> 01:07:50.510
Um You know, if let's say during a quantum

1020
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:57.199
event uh that somehow affected um the rest of

1021
01:07:57.209 --> 01:08:01.429
our lives, it's unlikely that um an obs a

1022
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:05.060
single quantum observation will make a big difference in

1023
01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:09.870
our lives. But it's hypothetically possible that by making

1024
01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:13.350
a different observation that that could affect our lives

1025
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.830
and steer our lives on a different course.

1026
01:08:18.019 --> 01:08:22.969
And so, of course, in science fiction, many times,

1027
01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:27.877
people use the idea of time traveling and depict

1028
01:08:27.889 --> 01:08:32.099
it in different ways in movies, books, et cetera.

1029
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.720
But is there, is it theoretically possible according to

1030
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:42.779
physics for time traveling to exist or occur? And

1031
01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.140
if so, would it connect in any way to

1032
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:48.549
the idea of the multiverse or

1033
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.020
not? Well, when we talk about time travel, we

1034
01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:55.720
need to distinguish between time travel into the future

1035
01:08:56.229 --> 01:09:00.939
and time travel into the past. Well as Einstein

1036
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:05.129
uh showed in his, in his special theory of

1037
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:10.620
relativity, if you take an astronaut launch the astronaut

1038
01:09:10.629 --> 01:09:14.879
to space and that astronaut somehow can travel very,

1039
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:17.240
very close to the speed of light. And that

1040
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:22.020
astronaut returns to earth, that astronaut's clock would tick

1041
01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:27.459
more slowly than earth clocks. And that astronaut could

1042
01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:31.950
theoretically travel into the future of earth. Um So,

1043
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:39.339
for example, uh if that astronaut was traveling 99.99%

1044
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:43.140
the speed of light, they might come back and

1045
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:47.339
see that all of their relatives are either, you

1046
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:51.919
know, 100 years old or, or likely deceased. Um,

1047
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:55.750
YOU know, and uh Earth is, you know, instead

1048
01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:59.229
of being the 21st century and the 22nd century,

1049
01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.779
um because time is relative. So that is a

1050
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:06.009
relatively simple way to time travel. And that create

1051
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.370
doesn't create any contradictions because you would just go

1052
01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:13.759
into the future, you would arrive in the future

1053
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:18.160
and you would maybe have different customs and, you

1054
01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:20.930
know, you would say, where, where are the smartphones

1055
01:10:20.939 --> 01:10:23.640
and say, no, we use brain chips now or

1056
01:10:23.649 --> 01:10:27.120
we use something else. So you would say, ok,

1057
01:10:27.129 --> 01:10:30.080
technology has advanced. So that would be one way

1058
01:10:30.089 --> 01:10:32.890
of time travel. But what about traveling to the

1059
01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:37.140
past? We imagine going back in time and trying

1060
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:40.720
to prevent the Second World War or something like

1061
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:44.569
that, you know, you know, all these tr tragedies.

1062
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:50.439
Um Well, physics does have the possibility of that

1063
01:10:50.529 --> 01:10:55.560
by creating something called a wormhole. Now, a wormhole

1064
01:10:55.569 --> 01:10:58.120
traversable wormhole is a little bit like a black

1065
01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:03.399
hole only it's stabilized. So instead of having this

1066
01:11:03.799 --> 01:11:09.319
um very narrow uh tunnel that possibly connects to

1067
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:13.640
another region of space that would not be uh

1068
01:11:13.979 --> 01:11:17.270
you cannot travel into which will be deadly. Um

1069
01:11:17.279 --> 01:11:22.819
We imagine being able to stabilize this tunnel and

1070
01:11:22.939 --> 01:11:25.379
make it so that you can travel through it

1071
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:28.419
and end up in a different part of space.

1072
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:32.870
Well as uh Kip Thorne and some of his

1073
01:11:32.879 --> 01:11:36.250
students showed, uh there's a way that you can

1074
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.799
uh manipulate the wormhole so that they can act

1075
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.879
as a time machine and you could travel backward

1076
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:48.629
in time. And um and then uh you wouldn't

1077
01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.569
be able to travel before the creation of the

1078
01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.560
wormhole, but you could travel back to at least

1079
01:11:54.569 --> 01:11:57.779
the time when the wormhole was created. And uh

1080
01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.759
so if there are wormholes that were created naturally

1081
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:04.609
in space that were useful as time machines, you

1082
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.560
could use one of those. And then the question

1083
01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:10.470
is, could you affect history? And the way it

1084
01:12:10.479 --> 01:12:15.040
connects with the multiverse is in science fiction, particularly,

1085
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.529
there's this idea that maybe if you go backward

1086
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.919
in time and you try to change history that

1087
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:25.839
maybe you start a new branch of reality. So

1088
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:29.020
for example, let's say you go back in time

1089
01:12:29.029 --> 01:12:33.390
to the age of Hitler and you assassinate Hitler

1090
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:38.319
and there's no Hitler, there's no Nazi Germany and

1091
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:41.169
World War Two doesn't happen, but maybe something else

1092
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:45.080
happens, maybe Stalin becomes all powerful and takes over

1093
01:12:45.089 --> 01:12:49.899
Europe. And then, um so now we have, instead

1094
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:53.790
of, you know, Nazis trying to take over Europe

1095
01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:57.580
that's run by Stalin and the Soviets. OK. So

1096
01:12:57.589 --> 01:13:00.399
that's a different branch of reality, maybe that would

1097
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.729
represent, you know, a type of multiverse where you

1098
01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.629
have all these other alternative histories. But that is

1099
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.080
very science fiction, a very speculative. It's not something

1100
01:13:11.089 --> 01:13:12.509
that physics can prove.

1101
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.660
So another thing that perhaps is also speculative you,

1102
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:23.910
you tell me is the simulation hypothesis. So what

1103
01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:27.939
is it? And does it also, does it have

1104
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.580
any relationship to the multiverse?

1105
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:39.229
Well, um the simulation hypothesis is the idea that

1106
01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:42.790
could it be possible that everything we see, everything

1107
01:13:42.799 --> 01:13:48.109
we observe is a computer simulation that was designed

1108
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.870
by some other intelligent being. And the argument for

1109
01:13:53.879 --> 01:14:00.729
that is imagine our civilization, um our own civilization

1110
01:14:00.919 --> 01:14:04.910
evolves naturally. And currently we have some forms of

1111
01:14:04.919 --> 01:14:09.569
artificial intelligence like we could create, you know, at

1112
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.759
this point in time, you can create an essay

1113
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:15.129
that looks like it was written by a human

1114
01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.979
being. It might have some mistakes, you know, using

1115
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:21.959
chat G BT or some other mechanism. Well, imagine

1116
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.209
um that you could uh create a simulated human

1117
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.759
being, you know, something that would be indistinguishable by

1118
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:34.250
from a human being. And then you go on

1119
01:14:34.259 --> 01:14:37.330
to create a simulated city where you have human

1120
01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:42.209
beings interact and it seems like human beings and

1121
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.580
then you create a simulated planet and then maybe

1122
01:14:45.589 --> 01:14:50.759
a simulated, you know, solar system simulated galaxy. Well,

1123
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:58.149
if intelligence intelligent beings uh last long enough, the

1124
01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.990
chances according to some thinkers that they could create

1125
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.810
a simulation is 100% that eventually they would develop

1126
01:15:08.819 --> 01:15:12.870
the technology for this. So then imagine you have

1127
01:15:12.879 --> 01:15:17.540
all these uh natural worlds out there that create

1128
01:15:17.549 --> 01:15:20.700
simulation. So you would have all these simulated worlds

1129
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:26.470
out there. Eventually, the simulated worlds would greatly outnumber

1130
01:15:26.479 --> 01:15:29.479
the natural worlds because you could have one natural

1131
01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:33.049
world creating all these simulated worlds. So then you

1132
01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:36.759
estimate the chances that we're in a simulated world

1133
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:40.620
or a natural world and that becomes almost 100%

1134
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:43.580
according to these thinkers that were in a simulated

1135
01:15:43.589 --> 01:15:46.890
world, not a natural world. So I don't quite

1136
01:15:46.899 --> 01:15:52.100
buy that idea personally. Um BECAUSE, you know, there's,

1137
01:15:52.279 --> 01:15:56.229
there's all these other arguments about design that were

1138
01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.959
designed and uh the simplest one that, you know,

1139
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.220
people who are religious believe or may some people

1140
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:10.609
religious believe? Well, we were designed by a divine

1141
01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.370
being. Ok. Well, some people don't believe that some

1142
01:16:14.379 --> 01:16:18.069
people do believe that, but it's a simpler belief

1143
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:21.250
to say that there's a divine being out there

1144
01:16:21.259 --> 01:16:25.149
than to say, oh, well, there's another, you know,

1145
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.950
set of beings that created us well, who created

1146
01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:32.029
them, you know, were they as simulation? And it

1147
01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.229
gets into this whole uh philosophical uh tangled argument

1148
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.009
about, you know, why are there real beings? Why

1149
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.830
are they simulated beings? And what's the connection?

1150
01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:48.959
And if we actually were living in a simulation,

1151
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:52.899
would there be any way at all of verifying

1152
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:57.240
that of empirically? I mean, being sure of that.

1153
01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.060
Well, I can only turn to science fiction and

1154
01:17:01.069 --> 01:17:04.240
say, well, maybe someone would hand us a red

1155
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.810
pill and you take it and all of a

1156
01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:08.000
sudden you see, you see everything like in the

1157
01:17:08.009 --> 01:17:14.080
matrix. Um BECAUSE um you know, if it was,

1158
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:19.020
it was a really smart intelligent being, they would

1159
01:17:19.029 --> 01:17:24.439
create a perfect simulation. So um but uh you

1160
01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:28.970
could speculate about intelligent being that's very, very, very

1161
01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:33.319
smart but makes mistakes and creates a flawed simulation.

1162
01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:36.770
So all of a sudden you wake up and

1163
01:17:36.779 --> 01:17:39.069
you look up at the sky and instead of

1164
01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.779
seeing, seeing the moon or whatever, you know, wake

1165
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:44.689
up at night and instead of seeing the moon,

1166
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.209
you see something that looks like pixels and you're

1167
01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.770
like, wait a minute, what are those pixels doing

1168
01:17:49.779 --> 01:17:54.200
there? But you know, if, if an intelligent race

1169
01:17:54.209 --> 01:17:58.009
was smart enough to develop a simulation, it would,

1170
01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.660
it would conceivably be a perfect simulation, then you

1171
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:03.569
wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So this

1172
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.390
becomes almost like, you know, in a way, I

1173
01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:10.250
think it gets a little silly uh a little

1174
01:18:10.259 --> 01:18:14.450
comical like, OK, you know, if it's a perfect

1175
01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:19.770
simulation, could there be flaws? OK, that's gets a

1176
01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:21.890
little bit silly to think about things like that.

1177
01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:26.770
So we've been touching on science fiction here and

1178
01:18:26.779 --> 01:18:31.470
there during our conversation. But what are probably some

1179
01:18:31.479 --> 01:18:35.470
of the most common ways that in popular culture,

1180
01:18:35.589 --> 01:18:40.839
people portray the multiverse and as a physicist, I

1181
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.779
mean, is it that you just take it lightly?

1182
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:48.160
I mean, it's just fiction, whatever or, uh is

1183
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:50.680
it that some of those ways that the multiverse

1184
01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:53.970
is portrayed actually bother you?

1185
01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:57.339
Well, I think of it from the point of

1186
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:01.500
view of somebody who's a researcher and they apply

1187
01:19:01.509 --> 01:19:03.790
to the government for a grant or they applied

1188
01:19:03.799 --> 01:19:07.580
to a corporation for a grant. So let's say

1189
01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:11.540
they have this idea for testing, you know, using

1190
01:19:11.549 --> 01:19:15.430
observations of the cosmic micro background to test for

1191
01:19:15.439 --> 01:19:20.339
other universes and the word multiverse comes up and

1192
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:23.500
they send it to, um, somebody to review their

1193
01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:28.390
grants and that person has just seen a marvel

1194
01:19:28.399 --> 01:19:31.189
movie they see, just saw Doctor Strange in the

1195
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.390
Multiverse of Madness and they come back and say

1196
01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:37.089
this is not real science. This is science fiction.

1197
01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:41.250
You don't get any money from me or it's

1198
01:19:41.259 --> 01:19:44.790
another possibility. You could have someone who says, wow,

1199
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.009
I love that movie. I love science fiction. You

1200
01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.580
know, that's really cool that you can test these

1201
01:19:50.589 --> 01:19:53.959
things in real life. You get, you know, here's

1202
01:19:54.060 --> 01:20:00.689
$100,000 you know, for your grant, €100,000. So then,

1203
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.649
um then you could be lucky. So it's, it's

1204
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:06.939
a little bit of a mixed thing. Some scientists

1205
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:10.770
are like, well, science fiction talks about multiverse ideas,

1206
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.819
those are really not real science. So let's not

1207
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:19.720
even talk about a multiverse and others uh appreciate

1208
01:20:19.799 --> 01:20:24.080
the popular interest as a way of supporting science.

1209
01:20:24.089 --> 01:20:26.799
Like, OK, you've learned, you've seen the Multiverse in

1210
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:30.379
movies, let me show you the real multiverse ideas.

1211
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:33.290
Forget about the movies. Here's the real science of

1212
01:20:33.299 --> 01:20:38.410
it. So in the movies, the main attraction is

1213
01:20:38.419 --> 01:20:42.049
the idea of, of what if you know, what

1214
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:46.629
if you know Spiderman came from a different background?

1215
01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:51.140
What if you know in Star Trek instead of

1216
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:56.720
Spock being logical and emotionless? What if Spock were

1217
01:20:56.729 --> 01:21:01.430
evil and very emotional? So we see, you know,

1218
01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:05.209
an alternate universe where Spock as a beard and

1219
01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:08.640
is sinister and so forth. So these are all

1220
01:21:08.649 --> 01:21:11.799
talked about in, um, you know, in science fiction.

1221
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:15.509
And then there's even the simple question, what if

1222
01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.930
I missed a train instead of making a train?

1223
01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:21.520
And that's the movie sliding doors where a woman

1224
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:25.785
just misses a subway train versus just makes a

1225
01:21:25.794 --> 01:21:30.024
subway train? And the movie shows what happens to

1226
01:21:30.035 --> 01:21:32.975
her life in the, the world where she just

1227
01:21:32.984 --> 01:21:36.055
makes the train and now their possibility where she

1228
01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:38.495
just misses the train. And in one of them,

1229
01:21:38.504 --> 01:21:42.495
she discovers that her boyfriend is having an affair

1230
01:21:42.515 --> 01:21:44.625
with another woman and she breaks up with the

1231
01:21:44.634 --> 01:21:49.725
boyfriend, she finds another boyfriend who's much nicer and

1232
01:21:49.734 --> 01:21:53.700
her life continues and then in the other scenario,

1233
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:56.959
she doesn't discover that her boyfriend is cheating on

1234
01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:00.709
her, she continues with the same boyfriend and then

1235
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.470
we see what happens at the end and I'm

1236
01:22:02.479 --> 01:22:06.990
not gonna give too much away, but the branch

1237
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.549
of reality, which looks like a good one might

1238
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.790
not be so good after all in the movie.

1239
01:22:12.799 --> 01:22:16.149
So, these are intriguing ways to think about the

1240
01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.490
multiverse in science fiction.

1241
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:22.520
Uh, I mean, it's as if, uh, every time

1242
01:22:22.529 --> 01:22:27.479
in movies, every time people think about different possibilities,

1243
01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:31.089
they're dealing with counterfactual in their mind. What if

1244
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:35.609
this happened? What if that happened? Reality branched and

1245
01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.990
then a new universe popped up where the, what

1246
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.819
if really happened?

1247
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.410
Right. Yes, that's right. So we, we often imagine,

1248
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.779
uh, what happened, what would happen if we made

1249
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:52.569
different decisions in our lives? Like what if we

1250
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.100
decided to move to a different city? So, um,

1251
01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.779
you know, what if we decided a different job?

1252
01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:03.720
So, so imagine we grew up and as a

1253
01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:07.419
teenager, we were in a rock band and, you

1254
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.540
know, we played it at our high school and

1255
01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:13.250
everybody applauded and then our parents say, wait a

1256
01:23:13.259 --> 01:23:16.040
minute, you can't make any money from a rock

1257
01:23:16.049 --> 01:23:19.020
rock music. You should go into a serious job

1258
01:23:19.029 --> 01:23:23.080
and we become an accountant instead. But then, um,

1259
01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.479
we imagine what would be a scenario where we

1260
01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:29.399
say to our parents. No, no, no. We wanted

1261
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:33.399
to stay in music and then we become The

1262
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:36.410
Beatles or The Rolling Stones or, you know, they're

1263
01:23:36.419 --> 01:23:39.899
very successful rock band. We say, ah, it's very

1264
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:42.120
good that we didn't listen to our parents. And

1265
01:23:42.129 --> 01:23:45.569
we, we pursued our musical dream because we became

1266
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.250
one of the most successful bands of all time.

1267
01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:53.020
So we don't know until, unless there were, uh,

1268
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.290
you know, the possibility of viewing other universes, other

1269
01:23:56.299 --> 01:23:59.410
branches of reality, we wouldn't know if our decisions

1270
01:23:59.419 --> 01:24:01.910
were good decisions or bad decisions.

1271
01:24:03.069 --> 01:24:06.450
So one last question and then sort of related

1272
01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:10.669
to this previous one. Do you see, I, I

1273
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.720
mean, how do you look at the popular ideas

1274
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:16.189
that people have about the universe? Do you think

1275
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.620
that they attribute specific meanings to the universe to

1276
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:25.109
the multiverse that the it might be meaningful in

1277
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.439
some way for people to consider the possibility of

1278
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:31.209
a multiverse existing?

1279
01:24:32.430 --> 01:24:35.259
Well, I think it's, it's fun to imagine about

1280
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:40.080
different things. And I like science fiction personally and

1281
01:24:40.089 --> 01:24:44.129
I like dreaming about other worlds and thinking about

1282
01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.850
different scenarios and I think that's, that's perfectly healthy.

1283
01:24:47.979 --> 01:24:49.939
Uh The only time I have a bit of

1284
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:54.720
an objection is when people exploit quantum physics or

1285
01:24:54.729 --> 01:24:58.689
exploit the idea of a multiverse and try to

1286
01:24:58.779 --> 01:25:03.529
convince people that um they can control their own

1287
01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.890
reality by using quantum physics. So they say they'll

1288
01:25:07.899 --> 01:25:10.970
say something like, like all you have to do

1289
01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:17.270
is want to be rich and you know, um

1290
01:25:17.569 --> 01:25:20.669
you know, buy my book or listen to my

1291
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.629
audio. I'll show you how, so it's only $100

1292
01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.060
for this audio. And you'll learn how that using

1293
01:25:28.069 --> 01:25:32.200
quantum physics, you'll uh use your mind and make

1294
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:35.194
the right choice and that will you into a

1295
01:25:35.205 --> 01:25:39.104
universe where you're very wealthy using, you know, the

1296
01:25:39.115 --> 01:25:42.814
idea of a multiverse. Well, somebody is making money

1297
01:25:42.845 --> 01:25:47.354
from a false premise there but it's very easy

1298
01:25:47.495 --> 01:25:50.115
to try to exploit physics and to try to

1299
01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:53.555
convince people uh that they can use it to

1300
01:25:53.564 --> 01:25:57.964
become rich or become, you know, immortal, become, you

1301
01:25:57.975 --> 01:26:00.879
know, super healthy and so forth. So I would

1302
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:04.649
steer personally, I would steer away from those ideas

1303
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:08.859
because it's, it's not really a proper use of

1304
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.799
a physics to say if you think you're rich,

1305
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:12.810
you're gonna be rich.

1306
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:17.819
It's like that very popular book from a few

1307
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:22.500
years ago. The Secret, right? And other similar ideas

1308
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:26.629
popularized by some self help gurus, right?

1309
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.720
Yes. Although there are people who, who find quantum

1310
01:26:30.729 --> 01:26:33.950
books in the self help section of a bookstore

1311
01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.540
and then become seriously interested in real scientific ideas.

1312
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:43.520
Like for example, um uh I, I know a

1313
01:26:43.529 --> 01:26:50.620
rock musician who in the 19 nineties looked at

1314
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:52.959
a lot of self help books and that led

1315
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:56.109
him to write songs about quantum physics. So it

1316
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.669
can be a good thing. Well,

1317
01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.020
let's send on that note then and the book

1318
01:27:02.029 --> 01:27:05.990
is again the lure of the multiverse extra dimensions,

1319
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.370
other worlds and parallel universes. I'm leaving a link

1320
01:27:09.379 --> 01:27:12.470
to it in the description of the interview. And

1321
01:27:12.479 --> 01:27:15.430
uh Paul just before we go apart from the

1322
01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:17.549
book, would you like, would you like to let

1323
01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.830
people know where they can find you when your

1324
01:27:19.839 --> 01:27:21.029
work on the internet?

1325
01:27:22.089 --> 01:27:24.359
Well, I'm active on what used to be known

1326
01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:27.910
as Twitter, also known as X. I'm also on

1327
01:27:27.919 --> 01:27:31.779
uh Blue Sky Mastodon. I have my own uh

1328
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:37.779
blog. Uh Yeah, it's active sometimes I post things

1329
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:40.810
and I post articles. Uh So if you Google

1330
01:27:40.819 --> 01:27:43.740
my name, uh some of these things should come

1331
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:47.890
up, you know, social media, there's a Facebook writing

1332
01:27:47.899 --> 01:27:50.689
page for me, but I'm not uh involved in

1333
01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.240
that, but there are a lot of social media

1334
01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:56.750
that you can reach out to me and especially

1335
01:27:56.759 --> 01:28:00.750
on um X Twitter. I'm, I'm very active on

1336
01:28:00.759 --> 01:28:03.169
that under the hand of P Halpern.

1337
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:07.169
Great. So I'm also leaving that in the description

1338
01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.689
of the interview and thank you so much again
