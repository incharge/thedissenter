00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.840
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.529
joined by Angara Kev. She is a senior phd

4
00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.819
student student at Central European University in Vienna. She

5
00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.020
is a cognitive anthropologist, work on moral fairness, perceptions

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.840
of it and the topic of gender inequality. And

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.909
today we're going to talk precisely about those topics

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.520
and also individual references. So, and Gica, welcome to

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.100
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.400
Thank you. Thank you so much for having me.

11
00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:34.099
I'm excited.

12
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.479
So starting with the topic of moral fairness. Since

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.479
you are an anthropologist and come from a cognitive

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.080
anthropology perspective specifically, could you tell us first, how

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.029
do you approach such a topic, the topic of

16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.029
fairness from that perspective? How do you study it?

17
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.880
So, I um actually, for me personally, anthropology came

18
00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.750
a bit later in my life than behavioral sciences

19
00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:06.650
and cognitive science. So I um so it sort

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.690
of depends on how exactly and which field of

21
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:13.160
study exactly do you define as cognitive anthropology? I

22
00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.660
think there's a lot of debate about that itself.

23
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.690
Which part of cognitive science constitutes as cognitive anthropology.

24
00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:23.449
I feel that when you're doing um field work

25
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.019
and when you're looking at populations in a very

26
00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:29.230
detailed manner and looking at the psychological processes that

27
00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.830
should constitute cognitive anthropology. And from that perspective, I

28
00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:39.569
would say, um moral fairness would be how people

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.970
in specific societies describe fairness to be what they

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.650
find to be mutually acceptable. And fairness usually arises

31
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.839
in the questions of distributive justice. So how people

32
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.319
want uh distribution and redistribution of resources in their

33
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.339
land? And then uh if you're talking about it

34
00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.489
as a cognitive anthropologist, you want to know how

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.510
people coming from different cultures, uh different groups, different

36
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.989
ethno linguistic groups consider uh how they want to

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.509
distribute resources within themselves. But then there's also more

38
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.729
philosophical traditions uh within cognitive anthropology and that would

39
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.800
be more prescriptive. So then you look at, um

40
00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.279
and when it's prescriptive, it's always sort of leaning

41
00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.380
towards um ideas of equality and equity somewhat. And

42
00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.990
then you try to find out under what circumstances

43
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.639
and what kinds of people usually um wish to

44
00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.460
have more equality in which sorts of distributions. So

45
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.910
there can be those two perspectives. I usually look

46
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.350
at the more descriptive perspective where I go out

47
00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.500
to different populations, I give them hypothetical scenarios or

48
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.309
games or um other things. And then you ask

49
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.509
them what they consider to be fair and just

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.559
to add one thing, um there's fairness, there's a

51
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.990
huge problem with the language because fairness is an

52
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.729
English word and in many languages across the world,

53
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.399
including in Portuguese, in Hindi and Bengali, which are

54
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.539
my native languages. There is no direct translation for

55
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.320
fairness. So sometimes when you're trying to do this

56
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.759
sort of descriptive cognitive anthropology and trying to ask

57
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.020
people what they think of as fair, you have

58
00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:25.009
to use words which mean correct uh way of

59
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.389
doing something or the right way of doing something.

60
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.399
So it's a bit um anglicized. I would say

61
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.199
this field of research.

62
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.669
Yeah. Uh That's totally true. I mean, I've already

63
00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:39.289
in fact, uh fought about that in Portuguese because

64
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.669
we don't have a specific word for that. I

65
00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:46.160
mean, uh we usually translate it fairness, we usually

66
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.059
say justice, but justice would be more or less

67
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.919
the equivalent, the equivalent of justice. And I mean,

68
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.070
it's not exactly the same thing. And I would

69
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.470
imagine that particularly when you try to study a

70
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.919
topic cross culturally as an anthropologist, you uh run

71
00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.910
against these sorts of obstacles, linguistic and cultural because

72
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.470
many times we have to take into account that

73
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.750
the concepts people use in their own culture might

74
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.950
not correspond exactly to the way we conceptualize things

75
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.070
in a Western language.

76
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.200
Yeah, I think in the in western societies also,

77
00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:29.410
I mean, there is a huge influence of the

78
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.309
philosophical view of equity in western populations generally because

79
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.100
so um let me give an example when you

80
00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:39.929
go to India. Um IF you go to a,

81
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.929
a rural village in India which is less touched

82
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.100
by Western influences. And you ask uh people in

83
00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:50.339
that village regarding their fairness, judgments about a specific

84
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.549
distribution that's happening. They would find the question very

85
00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.750
nonsensical. They'll be like, why do we have to

86
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.779
judge fairness at all? Things are the way they

87
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.269
are whereas in the West or even within India,

88
00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.299
but in more westernized um sections of India, there

89
00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.519
would always be a bit of this philosophical touch

90
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.440
upon how they are making judgments. They think that

91
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.149
they can make judgments and they will always try

92
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.519
to have a more prescriptive approach towards making such

93
00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.320
moral judgments of fairness

94
00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.279
and related to fairness. I mean, it's one thing

95
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.420
to study fairness, but there's also how people perceive

96
00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:34.679
fairness or fairness, perception. So how do you study

97
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.940
that specifically?

98
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.489
I think that's the more interesting question for me,

99
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.799
that's, that's what matters if people perceive unequal distributions

100
00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.070
to be fair, I think, then we are set,

101
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.269
it does not really matter what it should be

102
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.519
and what it has been and what uh the

103
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.519
academic say it should be or the philosopher say

104
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.140
it should be. I think that's the most important

105
00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.799
thing. And um so that in that case, the

106
00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.589
cross cultural work becomes very interesting and important because

107
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.190
there's a lot of variation in how people make

108
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.410
up their expectations about social interactions. And um if

109
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.619
they are expecting social interactions or distributions to go

110
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.510
a certain way, they would have a higher perception

111
00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:20.559
of fairness in those distributions. So it's really tied

112
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.559
to what's the, the sort of mutual acceptability across

113
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.369
in, within a society and based on those mu

114
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.519
mutual acceptability norms, what sort of expectations individuals have

115
00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.869
for themselves? And that leads to perceptions of fairness.

116
00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.339
And do these perceptions of fairness vary a lot?

117
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.440
Cross culturally,

118
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.089
yes. Yes, I, I would say so. Um Yes,

119
00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:53.440
cross culturally. And I would uh be careful about

120
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.600
how you define culture. So I would be careful

121
00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:59.750
to say it's not just across countries but within

122
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.320
countries within the same city, between socio economic groups,

123
00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:05.829
uh between gender groups. Uh There's a lot of

124
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.720
variation and all of those groups I would consider

125
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.390
as different forms of culture. Um Yeah. So there

126
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.230
is um yes, a lot of cross cultural differences.

127
00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:18.480
I could share one of the studies that we've

128
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:22.130
been doing recently in India. So the study started

129
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.380
off by us collecting um data on how people

130
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.730
perceive fairness within unequal divisions of labor scenarios in

131
00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.320
online participants. So we were first studying um participants

132
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.000
from the UK or generalized online participants on Amazon

133
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.190
Mechanical Turk. And you get like a sort of

134
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.829
homogenized sort of responses but not a lot of

135
00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:50.350
standard deviation around um the mean response. But then

136
00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:52.670
uh we were doing, we start, we took this

137
00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:55.700
experiment over to India and started looking at how

138
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.670
different socio-economic classes might have very different judgments of

139
00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:03.339
fairness regarding the same unequal division of labor. And

140
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.070
there is indeed a lot of difference, like significant

141
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.790
difference between uh higher socio economic classes and lower

142
00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:12.239
socio economic classes. And then if you look at

143
00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.440
between Western societies and small scale societies, there'll be

144
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.750
a lot. So yeah, between these big societies within

145
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.799
a specific country that, yeah, there can be so

146
00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:27.269
many different levels of variation. It's uh yeah, you

147
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.010
can ask me more specific questions, I guess. And

148
00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.130
then I can tell you which differences occur in

149
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.830
which society.

150
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.390
Yes, sure. No, I was just going to say

151
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.558
before I ask you, I ask you that that

152
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.390
just earlier this year, I interviewed an anthropologist for

153
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.789
the show and we were talking precisely about this

154
00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:49.590
topic of what counts as a different culture, what

155
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.989
are cultural differences? And at a certain point he

156
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.219
is American and he was saying, oh, I don't

157
00:08:56.229 --> 00:08:59.653
know what people mean when they say American culture

158
00:08:59.663 --> 00:09:03.382
because I don't see any unified culture here. And

159
00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:05.752
then he asked me directly. 00, and what do

160
00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:08.612
you think a Portuguese culture is? And I was

161
00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:11.132
silent for like 10 seconds because I was like,

162
00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:14.052
oh my God, I don't know how to answer

163
00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:17.622
that question because there's really differences between people who

164
00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:22.132
live in urban environments versus rural environments, even within

165
00:09:22.143 --> 00:09:26.075
urban environments, people from different socioeconomics drive and all

166
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:28.685
of that. I mean, that, that is fairly obvious

167
00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:32.575
but we're talking all the time about Portuguese culture,

168
00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:36.616
American culture, German culture. And that doesn't make much

169
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:38.585
sense at all. From an anthropological,

170
00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:41.286
if you look at like within your family, even,

171
00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.916
you'll see all of these differences coming from. But

172
00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:46.786
because of the generation, because of who did what

173
00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:49.075
jobs and what jobs they're currently doing, how much

174
00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:52.020
they've traveled, there's like a bunch of differences that

175
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.190
come up within the same city, within the same

176
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.909
society. And I, I like that about anthropology that

177
00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:59.799
they recognize that. So in cross cultural psychology, what

178
00:09:59.809 --> 00:10:03.679
happens is when you want to replicate your study

179
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.469
across cultures, you sort of go in different countries

180
00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:09.909
and give the same study to different university students

181
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:13.359
in different countries. But that's really not representative of

182
00:10:13.369 --> 00:10:16.239
India or Portugal or us in any way. And

183
00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:20.780
anthropologists think a little bit more usually about what

184
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:23.979
does, what do you even mean by culture and

185
00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:27.719
how do you delineate a group of people to

186
00:10:27.729 --> 00:10:28.659
be in one culture?

187
00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:33.780
So tell us then about the specific kinds of

188
00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:38.570
uh societies that you've studied? Fairness perceptions in, you

189
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.299
mentioned India, for example. So tell us about where

190
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:48.520
you've studied uh these phenomenon specifically and what were

191
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.380
then the differences that you found?

192
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.409
So, um yeah, so the study that's that we

193
00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:59.849
just finished collecting data on was in India. So

194
00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.020
it started by being an online study. So I

195
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.729
have looked at populations on prolific and Amazon mechanical

196
00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:10.900
talk, which are worldwide populations. I've looked specifically at

197
00:11:10.909 --> 00:11:14.969
UK populations which are on prolific. And I have

198
00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:18.590
to tell you that um these online participant pools,

199
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.460
they are not representative of the UK or any

200
00:11:21.469 --> 00:11:24.580
specific country. Either these, these pools, I mean, nowadays

201
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.429
there's a lot of work just critiquing how these

202
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.280
specific pools of people who are on websites to

203
00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:33.679
get paid as participants have their own sort of

204
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.650
ways of behaving the specific culture in itself. So

205
00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:43.000
I've studied um across different participant recruitment platforms. Um

206
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.700
Online participants, I've done experiments in Vienna in the

207
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.919
lab to Austrian people. I've been going to India

208
00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:53.739
and doing field work um in the city of

209
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.419
Pune mostly. And then I've been looking at different

210
00:11:56.429 --> 00:12:00.260
socio economic groups. Uh So you in, in cities

211
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:04.510
in India, there's a lot of different um socio-economic

212
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.650
classes living within the same place. So you go

213
00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:09.789
to a market, there's people who are sitting in

214
00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:14.590
the coffee shop, drinking very expensive coffee, who are

215
00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:16.700
a specific cultural group. And then there's a people

216
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.650
cleaning the bathrooms of that coffee shop who will

217
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:21.270
be very different. So I was doing a bit

218
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.869
of field work looking at how the class difference

219
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.359
or the socio-economic differences um affect fairness judgments. And

220
00:12:28.369 --> 00:12:31.219
then um some of the very exciting work which

221
00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:33.260
I have not actually gone to the field for,

222
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.390
but I have been working with anthropologists who have

223
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.409
gone to the field as the Hunter gatherer stuff.

224
00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:40.609
So there's two field sites that we have. One

225
00:12:40.619 --> 00:12:43.440
is in Congo, it's called, the group is called

226
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.000
the Benj Baka. And then we have another field

227
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.289
site in the Philippines. The group is called, aka,

228
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.809
and I've been working a lot um with those

229
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.799
two groups as well. And actually before my phd,

230
00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:58.960
I used to do more work in person with

231
00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:02.119
university students because being a university student, it's easier

232
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.070
to get access to other university students and not

233
00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:08.690
that across different universities in the UK. But for

234
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.000
the fairness stuff, these are the populations that I've

235
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.640
been looking at

236
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.679
a and so looking across these different populations that

237
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.369
you've studied, what are perhaps some of the most

238
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.070
striking differences, not only across different uh countries but

239
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.299
also across different socio-economic stra.

240
00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:32.109
So in the case of India, where I'm looking

241
00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:35.400
at the differences in socio-economic groups and how that

242
00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:42.080
affects people from uh lower socio-economic classes whose parents

243
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.070
usually have had a farming background and now they

244
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.729
have come to the cities to do low paying

245
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:50.650
jobs. So that's the sort of demographic that we

246
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:53.450
were looking at. They are much more attuned to

247
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:59.070
the expectations of social roles than urbanized populations who

248
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.349
are living in the very uh urbanized parts of

249
00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:07.349
the city, basically the higher socio-economic plus. So social

250
00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:10.289
roles. So this is a study that we're specifically

251
00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:13.950
also trying to find out people's, um what's the

252
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.130
word people's endorsement of social roles in fairness, judgments

253
00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:21.650
because usually in fairness judgments, you try to take

254
00:14:21.659 --> 00:14:24.479
out any information about who plays which role to

255
00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.549
sort of remove impartiality. But we think that's wrong

256
00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:31.460
because if you're walking around in your offices or

257
00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:34.000
your house, I mean, who plays which role and

258
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.250
who is in what relationship with whom really decides

259
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.320
what's fair in a specific situation. So we were

260
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.580
looking at the endorsement of social roles like um

261
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:50.940
parents, brother, sister, nephews, uh office colleagues, friends of

262
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.700
different sorts of all sorts of social relationships that

263
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.929
make up our daily life. And we were trying

264
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.950
to see how much they are taken into account

265
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.619
when a person is looking at when a person

266
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.599
is considering fairness of a situation. And in lower

267
00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:07.770
socio economic classes in India, the social roles are

268
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.070
a very important way of organizing social life. And

269
00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:14.030
they are very embedded in the sort of expectations

270
00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.650
people have from themselves and from others for how

271
00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:19.200
to behave with each other. And thus they think

272
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.190
it's an important part of making any situation fair.

273
00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:25.429
Whereas that's not the case in the more westernized

274
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.919
um higher socio-economic classes in India

275
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.309
when it comes to the socio-economic classes in India,

276
00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:39.469
is there still a legacy of the caste system

277
00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:40.770
there or

278
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.359
not ask this all the time? And um I

279
00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:46.799
don't know a lot to be honest, I don't

280
00:15:46.809 --> 00:15:49.229
know a lot. The, I mean, I don't know

281
00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:52.190
a lot scientifically about the persistence of the cast

282
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.880
system. So I grew up in uh GGA which

283
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.150
is in Delhi. So it's like a very hyper

284
00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:04.130
urban place. And throughout my, so my parent, my

285
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.440
family does not really talk about. I, I don't

286
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.280
know what cast I come from, to be very

287
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:11.150
honest. And my family has never talked about this.

288
00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.049
I, that's why I don't know, it's never been

289
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.969
a part of discussion. I do see that the

290
00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:19.869
idea, the, the talks about cast coming up when

291
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.559
it comes to marriages, I've never seen it come

292
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.369
up in any other context like education or getting

293
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.570
a job or where you can live or who

294
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.599
you can be friends with. So I, but this

295
00:16:30.609 --> 00:16:32.349
is not my scientific knowledge. This is just my

296
00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:35.260
personal knowledge because yeah. Uh BUT in the case

297
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.469
of marriage, so now um more and more of

298
00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:40.479
my friends when they get married, some of the

299
00:16:40.489 --> 00:16:43.150
parents, not all are asking about what cost are

300
00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:46.099
their partners gonna be from. And that is a

301
00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:50.150
problem specifically for some specific costs like the Brahmins

302
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:54.280
who do not want to intermarry with non province.

303
00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:58.900
Uh BECAUSE they are the pure cast. And that's

304
00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:01.619
uh that's my knowledge of how much cast system

305
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.339
play. Well, I'm sure it's more in more rural

306
00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:07.589
areas but in hyper urbanized areas, there's really not

307
00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:09.368
a lot of talk about caste, I would say

308
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.310
no, I mean, to be fair, I haven't prepared

309
00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.400
this question. It was just that it came to

310
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.979
my mind spontaneously when we were talking about

311
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.699
the, yeah.

312
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.260
Yeah, socio-economic groups in India, you know, always the

313
00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:28.469
supposed uh leg or potential legacy of the caste

314
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.459
system which was abolished, not there that long ago.

315
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:33.979
So,

316
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.099
yeah, I'm pretty sure there has to be some

317
00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:39.699
sort of, um, what do you say? Oh, sorry.

318
00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:42.660
Another one more thing where the cost does come

319
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.619
into play when there's reservations in universities. So for

320
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.859
some specific costs and tribes there are, uh, so

321
00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.719
India has a positive uh discrimination system which is

322
00:17:54.729 --> 00:17:57.060
that you get, uh, you can have lesser, um,

323
00:17:57.069 --> 00:18:01.550
academic credentials but get into the same positions. So,

324
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.369
um, yeah, there is a bit of cost reservation,

325
00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:07.239
um, in India, in Indian Colleges. So, when I

326
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.140
was doing my undergrad in India, then this thing

327
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.739
sort of came up for a few people who

328
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.640
knew that they were from backward classes because obviously

329
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.910
there is a legacy there. If you were, um,

330
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.209
historically, very much disadvantaged, it will sort of carry

331
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:26.099
over. But I don't see it being a point

332
00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:30.030
of issue with the urban people now. So, yeah.

333
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:34.020
Mhm. Unless they're getting married then it is apparently.

334
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.310
Ok. So, uh, let's change topics now and talk

335
00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:40.719
a little bit about the work you've done on

336
00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:44.829
individual preferences. So, uh, first of all, from an

337
00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:49.920
anthropological perspective, what are individual preferences and how do

338
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.040
you approach them?

339
00:18:52.459 --> 00:18:57.469
Yeah. So, from an anthropological perspective, you cannot approach

340
00:18:57.479 --> 00:19:02.140
individual preferences without taking a look at what socio

341
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.959
cultural context the individual develops in and lives in.

342
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.880
I mean, if you were to ask a biologist

343
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.060
or a cognitive scientist, you'll get different answers. But

344
00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:15.500
as an anthropologist or even a human behavioral Ecologist,

345
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.520
um you'd say individual preferences are so, so much

346
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.709
more determined by the environment than by individual level

347
00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:26.869
factors like hormonal things. Um, THAT you should look

348
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.140
at the context really. So, yeah, as I've uh

349
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.189
even in the stuff on moral fairness and what

350
00:19:35.199 --> 00:19:38.609
are individual preferences for moral fairness, we could take

351
00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:41.859
it back to people's expectations, what people expect for

352
00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:44.900
themselves. And that is highly shaped by what they

353
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.069
have seen to be possible in, in the groups

354
00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:51.430
around them. So in their families, in their cultures,

355
00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:54.040
whatever people have been getting, I'm not saying that

356
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.859
individuals don't want to move away from unequal systems

357
00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:01.250
or disadvantaged systems. Uh JUST because their parents have

358
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.060
also been disadvantaged, but how much they want to

359
00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:07.449
move away from it is going to be determined

360
00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:10.579
by how, how disadvantaged their parents were. So a

361
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:13.369
little bit of social mobility might be great for

362
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.839
them and not so great for other people who

363
00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.119
have been made to feel more privileged in their

364
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:18.920
childhood.

365
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.770
Uh And when we're talking about social expectations here

366
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:29.699
that translates into or refers to a group values

367
00:20:29.709 --> 00:20:30.800
and norms,

368
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.280
right. Yes. So social expectations, people, others expectations of

369
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.989
you would be, um, group values and norms, but

370
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.650
I was talking more about individual expectations, the kind

371
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.270
of idea you have in your head about what

372
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.260
sort of life you should have and what you

373
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.020
deserve and what you should get. So, I think

374
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.760
I was referring more to the individual expectations which

375
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.920
are also really shaped by what you've seen to

376
00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.040
be possible in your specific, um, social group and

377
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.030
is shaped by social expectations.

378
00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:06.989
Mhm And, and how do you apply that to

379
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.689
studying phenomena like individualism and collectivism?

380
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.000
So this is something that I used to do

381
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.079
a while ago. Uh Stuff on individualism, collectivism. I'm

382
00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:22.180
still teaching that though. So individual, so I would

383
00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:27.520
not, I'd say that you're not applying an understanding

384
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.560
of um individual preferences on individualism collectivism. It's the

385
00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:35.780
other way around. There are, there is the idea.

386
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.719
So the idea of individualism collectivism is a concept.

387
00:21:38.729 --> 00:21:42.719
It's not the physical thing that's present in any

388
00:21:42.729 --> 00:21:46.489
individual. So there's a concept of some shared norms

389
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.930
or shared idea of how to do things. And

390
00:21:48.939 --> 00:21:53.489
that would in fact, uh affect the individual's preferences

391
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.719
of what sort of foods they like and how

392
00:21:56.729 --> 00:21:58.880
they think their goals should be determined and what

393
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.790
sort of family structures they want. So, yeah, usually

394
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.910
if the, the individualistic and collectivistic um differences between

395
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.869
uh cultures is something you can use as an

396
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.140
explanation for why individuals have specific preferences or not.

397
00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:16.560
I would say

398
00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:19.489
uh by the way do you think that this

399
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:26.310
sort of individualism, collectivism, uh, divide, that would also

400
00:22:26.339 --> 00:22:29.030
the way we would analyze that would be along

401
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.949
the lines of what we've talked about before. When

402
00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:34.930
it comes to, even within the same country, there

403
00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:39.500
are being cultural differences across socio-economic strait, across people

404
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.250
that live in urban versus rural areas. Because, I

405
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.130
mean, we usually talk about, for example, weird countries

406
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.094
being tendentially more individualistic and for example, East Asian

407
00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:57.604
countries being more collectivist collectivistic. But I mean, wouldn't

408
00:22:57.614 --> 00:23:01.714
we also see some of those differences? Uh, I

409
00:23:01.724 --> 00:23:07.844
mean, the across the individualism collectivism spectrum occur within

410
00:23:07.854 --> 00:23:12.125
the countries and across different groups as well.

411
00:23:12.969 --> 00:23:15.319
Yeah. So let me ask you a question, what

412
00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:19.380
do you, uh, if, um, individualism were one and

413
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.250
collectivism were 10, where would you put yourself to

414
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.949
be if you were to rate yourself on the

415
00:23:25.959 --> 00:23:28.630
scale between individualism and collectivism?

416
00:23:29.459 --> 00:23:31.780
Uh, OH, that's very easy for me. I mean,

417
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.290
I would, it would be like an eight, I

418
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.069
mean, I'm much more collectivist, an individualist really.

419
00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:40.979
But then people would de irate your country because

420
00:23:40.989 --> 00:23:44.000
it comes within Europe. It's one of the European

421
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.540
countries to be very individualistic. And I think whenever

422
00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.780
I ask any of my students, this question, there's

423
00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.650
always the sort of gap in how the literature

424
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.329
characterizes their country to be like, which sort of

425
00:23:56.479 --> 00:24:00.829
scale and what they themselves character, characterize themselves to

426
00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:03.520
be. And the same goes for them characterizing their

427
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.310
families, their friends. There's all sorts of variation. And

428
00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:10.569
um so there is a lot of variation between

429
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.890
countries. And I think there's been a lot of

430
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:19.680
um what do you say? Um CRITICISM of the

431
00:24:19.689 --> 00:24:22.520
east and the west divide, there's differences based on

432
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.000
age, there's differences based on socio economic class, there's

433
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.140
differences based on how educated you are. There's differences

434
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.310
based on gender and these differences will be there

435
00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:35.260
within each country, within each city, within each um

436
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:40.489
town. And it's really hard to say that the

437
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.180
whole of the US is going to be very

438
00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:45.819
individualist and all of China is going to be

439
00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:50.270
very collectivist that the younger populations in China are

440
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.250
probably a lot more individualist than the older generations

441
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.459
in the US or specific counties of the uh

442
00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:00.790
not counties, specific states of the US would be

443
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.099
a lot more collectivist than specific cities like Beijing.

444
00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:06.930
I don't know. I, I mean, I haven't looked

445
00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:09.310
at specific data but I'm just guessing and I

446
00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:11.329
think those sort of divides are sometimes a lot

447
00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:14.739
more important and a lot more informative than just

448
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.040
this whole country, sort of countrywide differences.

449
00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:22.890
But still on the topic of individualism and collectivism,

450
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.119
do we know what sorts of cultural factors play

451
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.609
a role in a preference for one or the

452
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:31.119
other?

453
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.849
Um What sort of culture? So I think your

454
00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:39.750
immediate group that you're physically surrounded by as a

455
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.670
child, so your family matters your neighborhood probably matters

456
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.839
what sort of, um, economic, socio economic conditions you

457
00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:51.089
grew up in that matters. And nowadays, another thing

458
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.530
which is super relevant is how much you've moved

459
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.489
and traveled as a child or as a young

460
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.739
adult. Because nowadays everyone's traveling all the time and

461
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.290
that would really have an effect on how individualist

462
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.979
you become and how collectivist you become the sort

463
00:26:05.989 --> 00:26:08.699
of life situations you've had matters. How early was

464
00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:10.380
it that you moved out of your house uh

465
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:16.310
out of your parents house. So there's um like

466
00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:18.979
a lot of the initial studies on individualism, collectivism

467
00:26:18.989 --> 00:26:23.170
was based on which country was your birth country.

468
00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:27.280
But nowadays, uh there's more and more studies looking

469
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.209
at things like socio-economic class and how it makes

470
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:35.189
you more individualistic or more collectivistic. So there's a,

471
00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:37.390
there's a list of factors I think.

472
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.650
Uh And uh at a certain point there, you

473
00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:45.989
mentioned people also moving or traveling. So can these

474
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.540
preferences for individualism or collectivism change in new cultural

475
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.130
environments? I mean, if someone moves to a new

476
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.790
cultural environment, can they become reps a little bit

477
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.800
more individually or a little bit more collectivist?

478
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.699
Yes. Um And that can happen. So, yeah, the

479
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:09.939
que the answer would be a big yes. And

480
00:27:09.949 --> 00:27:11.510
that can happen. I would say due to two

481
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.020
reasons. Firstly, if you're moving to a more individualistic

482
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.839
culture, you would at some point adopt some of

483
00:27:18.849 --> 00:27:23.510
the behavioral um ways of living of those cultures.

484
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.829
But also when you're moving away from, um, your

485
00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:30.469
house and you're learning to be self sufficient. I

486
00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:33.510
mean, what exactly is individualism and collectivism? Right. So,

487
00:27:33.949 --> 00:27:38.189
um, individualism is having a more independent control of

488
00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:40.219
the world and a more independent way of living

489
00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:43.260
than being interdependent. That's basically what it is at

490
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.430
the heart of it. So, if you are traveling

491
00:27:45.439 --> 00:27:47.900
and if you're living alone and that's why I

492
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.550
mentioned it would vary for um young adults who

493
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.459
have moved away from their parents at an earlier

494
00:27:54.469 --> 00:27:56.790
age and lived alone even within the same country

495
00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.989
versus those who have not. So I think if

496
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.859
you're learning to live alone in a very new

497
00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:04.890
place, you would at some point learn to have

498
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.189
uh more individual traits of behavior and you might

499
00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:09.949
not like it. And if you're really uncomfortable with

500
00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:12.650
it, you might move back to your home country,

501
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.359
you might, um, or you might end up finding

502
00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:18.229
a new group of friends which whom on whom

503
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:21.670
you can rely on. But I think the fact

504
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.569
of moving to another country, not just because of

505
00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:26.939
their ways of living, but also because you are

506
00:28:26.949 --> 00:28:30.670
having to learn to live by yourself would lead

507
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.000
to a higher level of individualism. And uh a

508
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.800
more academic answer to this possibility of change is

509
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.880
there's been a lot of studies on first. Um

510
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.500
What do you, what's it called? 1st, 1st generation

511
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.400
migrants, second generation migrants? Third generation migrants where you're

512
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.560
sort of looking at progressive increases of individualistic traits

513
00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:57.880
across generations of a specific migrant group in the,

514
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.569
in London or in any other place. I, I'm

515
00:29:00.579 --> 00:29:03.550
remembering a study that was done in London and

516
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.439
there is definitely a higher and higher um um

517
00:29:07.449 --> 00:29:10.530
um a greater and greater change in the amount

518
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.170
of individualism these different generations of migrants show and

519
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.489
it's called acculturation. There's a specific scientific term for

520
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.739
it. And a lot of sociologists and psychologists study

521
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.969
this, it's called a cult. It's been around for

522
00:29:23.979 --> 00:29:25.699
a while. It's been around this term has been

523
00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:29.520
around since the 1975 Engelhart and Baker gave a

524
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.670
definition of cultures changing because of intermixing of cultures.

525
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.050
And when you say cultures are changing, basically people

526
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.569
within those cultures are changing because there's a lot

527
00:29:38.579 --> 00:29:40.410
of mixing up of populations.

528
00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:45.349
So another topic that I would like to ask

529
00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:48.030
you about and is that is a big part

530
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.630
of your work as well? Is gender inequality? So

531
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:58.060
what is gender inequality? Again, from an anthropological perspective?

532
00:29:58.069 --> 00:30:02.069
I mean, what counts as gender inequality?

533
00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:08.020
It depends on which it depends on which question

534
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.540
you're interested in. Are you interested in economic inequality,

535
00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:17.099
political inequality, household inequality, inequality of opportunities. So there

536
00:30:17.109 --> 00:30:21.750
can be inequality in pretty much any domain of

537
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.180
human social life. And um again, if you're talking

538
00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:29.890
about the anthropological perspective and OK, I, I think

539
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.319
uh all the uh so far every time you've

540
00:30:32.329 --> 00:30:35.260
been asking me the anthropological perspective, I've been giving

541
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:38.719
you the social and cultural anthropological perspective. Not the

542
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.300
evolutionary one, the evolutionary one is closer to human

543
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.359
behavioral ecology or the biological one to be honest.

544
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.359
So, yeah, just um whenever you're seeing anthropology, just

545
00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:52.729
know that I'm responding as a social cultural anthropologist

546
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.939
and not the other branches. But uh yeah, so

547
00:30:55.949 --> 00:30:59.270
you can look at any domain of social activity

548
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.130
where there is some sort of um differences in

549
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.849
either distribution of resources or distribution of opportunities or

550
00:31:06.859 --> 00:31:12.449
distribution of autonomy, decision making power between the genders.

551
00:31:12.459 --> 00:31:14.989
So there's any sort of uh differences between gender

552
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.689
groups and that would form your study of gender

553
00:31:18.699 --> 00:31:20.369
inequality as an anthropologist.

554
00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:24.810
And what sorts of factors uh do you look

555
00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:29.859
into and that are behind gender inequality? Like for

556
00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:35.439
example, ecological, social, economical and economic and all of

557
00:31:35.449 --> 00:31:38.760
that, what specific kinds of factors play a role

558
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:44.449
in how gender inequality develops across societies?

559
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.819
You're talking about what I look at or

560
00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:49.260
what, what do you look at the N DS

561
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.770
more generally? Also if you could talk more generally

562
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.939
about some of those factors.

563
00:31:55.469 --> 00:31:58.459
Yeah, so there's so many different factors and so

564
00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:03.619
many different theoretical speculations regarding how and at what

565
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:08.510
point in human history, the gender inequality emerge. That

566
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.819
is ecological factors, there's um geographical factors, there's economic

567
00:32:14.829 --> 00:32:18.630
factors, there's a social factor, there's all the kind

568
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.520
of factors that you said they're all involved. So

569
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:27.459
one of the more evolutionary, one of the most

570
00:32:27.469 --> 00:32:31.819
famous evolutionary um narratives of why and how gender

571
00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:36.020
inequality came about talks about the fact that in

572
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:40.390
hunting gathering societies super small scale, very tight knit

573
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.609
um nomadic groups which are practicing immediate return, sort

574
00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:50.250
of subsistence activities. They are very egalitarian. That that's

575
00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.979
the kind of study. Uh THAT'S the kind of

576
00:32:51.989 --> 00:32:54.410
societies that I study right now as well. And

577
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.349
they are really egalitarian. Uh That's what we find

578
00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:01.660
over and over again. And then the evolutionary narrative

579
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:07.260
goes that once uh material storage became prevalent in

580
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.599
human societies, you could store uh whatever food you

581
00:33:10.609 --> 00:33:13.459
were producing, that allowed you to become sedentary because

582
00:33:13.469 --> 00:33:16.780
now your resources are sort of under your control,

583
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.810
you can start to domesticate resources and you have

584
00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:23.920
the emergence of material wealth and higher reliance on

585
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.150
agriculture generally because now you're sedentary, you're controlling your

586
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.719
crops. That is the sort of time when um

587
00:33:30.729 --> 00:33:34.520
inequality between men and women started to emerge. That's

588
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.199
one of the theories. And as any evolutionary theories

589
00:33:37.209 --> 00:33:39.819
is very hotly debated, but it's the one that

590
00:33:39.829 --> 00:33:44.640
has most support I would say. And um and

591
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.119
there's, there's a few um anthropologists who have been

592
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.680
lucky enough to see the transition within their lifetime.

593
00:33:51.689 --> 00:33:55.079
So they started off as phd students, uh Patricia

594
00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:57.650
Draper, she started off as a phd student looking

595
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.339
at the Kung bushmen of uh Botswana when they

596
00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:03.699
were still nomadic and very much reliant on hunting

597
00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:07.979
and gathering. But now with all the industrialized societies

598
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:11.219
expanding like anything and hunting gathering society, sort of

599
00:34:11.228 --> 00:34:14.219
getting, you know, pushed away to the fringes and

600
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:18.899
sometimes being swallowed up by these industrialized societies. So

601
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.540
her population, the one she started, started off as

602
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.969
a phd student looking at they eventually became more

603
00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:28.290
and more integrated with the nearby villages, they became

604
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.929
sedentary and then she saw that there they are.

605
00:34:31.938 --> 00:34:34.580
Then she has like a whole record of the

606
00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.949
amounts of gender inequality that would emerge. And she

607
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:40.219
has various theories about that. So it's not just

608
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:42.978
the physical act of becoming sedentary, which would lead

609
00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:47.340
to that, but the kind of subsistence practices that

610
00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.429
you have uh would have an effect. What sort

611
00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:53.649
of agriculture you start doing? In the case of

612
00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:58.389
the gung community in Botswana, they started trading with

613
00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:01.159
the nearby Bantu villagers a lot and the Bantu

614
00:35:01.169 --> 00:35:04.959
are known to be very uh gender unequal. And

615
00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:08.649
her Patricia Draper thinks that um it's not just

616
00:35:08.659 --> 00:35:11.729
a sedentary organization, but they had to become sedentary

617
00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:13.909
because they were trading with the Bantu. And then

618
00:35:13.919 --> 00:35:17.080
you sort of start taking up their social norms

619
00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.560
into your own culture. And that would be one

620
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.830
of the reasons why they went from being gender

621
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.389
egalitarian to gender in egalitarian. And then there's the

622
00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:31.469
theory about the plow and how plow agriculture specifically

623
00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:36.489
because if a lot of ecological affordances that it

624
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.169
has uh would lead to the relegation of women

625
00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:44.610
into the domestic sphere. And yeah, uh

626
00:35:44.969 --> 00:35:48.790
but, but ii, I mean, perhaps I'm missing just

627
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.790
one small step here or maybe I've missed something

628
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.649
among all of what you said there. But uh

629
00:35:55.659 --> 00:36:00.889
what uh so we have material storage right in

630
00:36:00.899 --> 00:36:05.810
uh agricultural societies or perhaps in some larger scale

631
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:11.649
under gatherer societies where that occurs? But why does

632
00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:18.360
material storage lead to gender inequality in the sense

633
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:24.919
of uh men acquiring more power and status than

634
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.280
women? Why couldn't it be the reverse? I mean

635
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:33.179
gender inequality but in on the opposite, in the

636
00:36:33.189 --> 00:36:34.159
opposite direction.

637
00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:37.510
So for there's two answers to this. So one

638
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.780
of the reasons why accumulation of wealth would lead

639
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.760
to inequality generally is because now you have wealth

640
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.239
that needs to be passed on to the next

641
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.479
generations. You have worked hard enough and there has

642
00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:51.610
to be a sort of an emergence of a

643
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.419
lineage system. And then you can say, well, the

644
00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:57.000
lineage system could be either on the maternal side.

645
00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.979
Uh YOU pass on the wealth along the maternal

646
00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:03.550
side and that's called matrilineal societies and they do

647
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.969
exist or on the paternal side. And then the

648
00:37:06.979 --> 00:37:10.040
second answer comes into play which is um the

649
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.439
emergence of plow agriculture allow uh was instrumental in

650
00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:18.969
giving men a lot more power over crop production

651
00:37:18.979 --> 00:37:22.550
and crop control and good for women. So uh

652
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.040
plow requires just the the structure, the technological structure

653
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.169
of the plow is such that you need to

654
00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:31.239
be uh you need to use a lot of

655
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.600
upper body strength. And when plows came into being

656
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.850
in subsistence, men became more important in crop production.

657
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.530
And then, then they are controlling all the resources,

658
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.280
they're controlling the food, which is the most fundamental

659
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.790
resource. And women cannot work on the fear. So

660
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.709
they are more and more in the house. They

661
00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:54.689
are more involved in giving birth and child rearing

662
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.429
and then the wealth is passed on from one

663
00:37:57.439 --> 00:37:59.760
male to the other and then it goes along

664
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.850
the patrilineal side.

665
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.679
Yeah. So, uh I I also want to address

666
00:38:08.689 --> 00:38:13.050
some claims that people nowadays make particularly in the

667
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:19.219
more developed societies about gender equality or inequality. But

668
00:38:19.229 --> 00:38:21.189
just before we get into that, and there's a

669
00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:26.810
sort of segue into that. Um HOW do industrialized

670
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.840
societies tend to compare uh to compare to uh

671
00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:35.790
hunter gatherer societies and agricultural societies when it comes

672
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.830
to levels of gender inequality?

673
00:38:40.169 --> 00:38:43.679
OK. So, um hunter gatherer society is the ones

674
00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:45.800
that I have been looking at which are immediate

675
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:50.199
returns, small scale hunter gatherer societies, not uh semi

676
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.409
sedentary, large scale ones because I guess you know

677
00:38:52.419 --> 00:38:54.919
that there's all sorts of hunter gatherers. So yeah,

678
00:38:55.169 --> 00:38:58.979
specific kind that I'm looking at there is a

679
00:38:58.989 --> 00:39:02.280
lot. So the industrialized societies are nowhere near when

680
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.010
it comes to gender equality. These hunt small scale

681
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.219
immediate return, hunter gatherer societies are known to be

682
00:39:09.229 --> 00:39:13.050
very, very egalitarian. They are. There's Jerome Lewis coined

683
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.389
the term assertively egalitarian for the Benj Baka. One

684
00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:20.169
of the groups that I'm looking at, um, and

685
00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:24.399
they're egalitarian because so there is a differentiation in

686
00:39:24.409 --> 00:39:27.310
genders in such that men and women are usually

687
00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.919
doing different things in the economy. Economy is just

688
00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:35.169
food, um, acquisition at this, at this stage, but

689
00:39:35.179 --> 00:39:37.479
both the things are really important. So in hunting

690
00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:40.879
and gathering ways of life, you hunt, that's a

691
00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:43.379
lot of protein and a lot of calories. But

692
00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:47.739
it also happens rarely. And it's, um, when it

693
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.469
happens, it's amazing and you're, you're contributing a lot

694
00:39:50.479 --> 00:39:53.219
more than gathering can, but it happens rarely and

695
00:39:53.229 --> 00:39:56.060
it's very uncertain when it's going to happen. And

696
00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.219
it depends not just on skill but on luck.

697
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.350
So men are bringing in calories but not every

698
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.370
day. And if women are the ones who are

699
00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:07.239
gathering, they are the ones bringing in calories, which

700
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.919
are much more reliable, much more regular. And thus,

701
00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:17.149
there's equal value to the production being, uh, production

702
00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:19.590
of both males and females. But at the same

703
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.040
time, there's a lot of interchange between the roles

704
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.090
of men being hunting, men, being hunters and women

705
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.800
being gatherers as well because men go gathering when

706
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.469
they can't go to hunt. And women are most

707
00:40:31.479 --> 00:40:34.429
of the times when there is net hunting involved

708
00:40:34.439 --> 00:40:36.459
in the groups that go out to hunt in

709
00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:39.260
a, in a big group for net hunting. So

710
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:45.580
I think because of this very important economic um

711
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:49.580
contribution factor of both males and females, they are

712
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.489
a lot more gender egalitarian, they are independent, they

713
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.649
can fend for themselves. So they're not, they're not

714
00:40:56.659 --> 00:40:59.219
dependent on their partners and both of them are

715
00:40:59.229 --> 00:41:01.469
valued a lot more. And because of that, there's

716
00:41:01.479 --> 00:41:05.020
a lot more decision making power for women in

717
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.459
these hunter gatherer societies and industrialized societies have, I

718
00:41:08.469 --> 00:41:10.870
mean, it depends on again which industrialized societies you're

719
00:41:10.879 --> 00:41:13.810
talking about. Of course, there's so many and we

720
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.060
know that in places like the Nordic countries, the

721
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.689
gender parity index is much, much, much higher than

722
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.500
let's say in Portugal or in the Philippines or

723
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.959
in India. So there's a huge difference there as

724
00:41:26.969 --> 00:41:31.760
well. But on the whole, um and agricultural societies

725
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.550
are really bad. I mean, if they come from

726
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.120
a lineage of plow agriculture and not um what's

727
00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:41.939
the other form? Um THE one with the sticks,

728
00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:47.870
one there's another shifting agriculture, sorry. Yeah. Um The

729
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.949
the countries which come from a tradition of plow

730
00:41:49.959 --> 00:41:53.989
agriculture have much more gender unequal norms which have

731
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.929
carried over into the present day. They don't do

732
00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.469
plow agriculture as the main thing anymore. But the

733
00:41:59.479 --> 00:42:04.219
norms still exist. So agriculture really brought about a

734
00:42:04.429 --> 00:42:08.770
huge amount of gender inequality and that carried over

735
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.530
in European societies. And when the Europeans were colonizing

736
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.330
Americas, they brought all of the hierarchical systems with

737
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.209
them. And I think after World War Two, when

738
00:42:19.219 --> 00:42:22.479
women got more involved in the labor force, uh

739
00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:26.290
things have changed again. But before World War two,

740
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.489
really, there was a lot more inequality than what

741
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.899
we see nowadays. So, um yeah, it's a bit

742
00:42:31.909 --> 00:42:34.850
of a complex thing. But on the whole immediate

743
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.750
return, gender, uh immediate return, hunter gatherers are a

744
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.149
lot more gender egalitarian than quite a few of

745
00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:43.719
the industrialist societies in the world.

746
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.219
Uh That's very interesting. And I really wanted to

747
00:42:47.229 --> 00:42:51.080
ask you that because a very common narrative that

748
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:55.639
we hear nowadays many times from political pundits, but

749
00:42:55.649 --> 00:42:59.020
also other times from other kinds of people, even

750
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:04.330
sometimes some scientists is that uh there's this narrative

751
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:08.790
as how uh I mean, particularly in the West

752
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.570
with the rise of the enlightenment and capitalism, all

753
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:18.189
of those sorts of things. Uh Eventually there was

754
00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:22.530
uh the emancipation of women. And nowadays, I don't

755
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.719
know a few decades on uh gender inequality is

756
00:43:27.729 --> 00:43:32.969
mostly they claim a thing of the past. But

757
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.419
I, I mean, there's lots to say about that,

758
00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:38.419
right?

759
00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.870
Yeah, I I, you brought this up and I

760
00:43:40.879 --> 00:43:44.129
was thinking about this because my brother was also

761
00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:46.879
talking about this that oh nowadays everyone is saying

762
00:43:46.889 --> 00:43:48.580
he's in the industry. I don't know what's going

763
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.479
on in the industry. I just know what's going

764
00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:52.679
on in the academic world, but he's doing a

765
00:43:52.689 --> 00:43:55.060
job. And he was saying, oh, yeah, gender inequality

766
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.310
is a thing of the past. And I was

767
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.600
like, really, I, I don't know, I mean, if

768
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.750
the narrative is out there, I'm, I'm not questioning

769
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.610
that this narrative is out there, but how can

770
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.169
it be a thing of the past? It's something

771
00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:08.969
that should just sort of continue, right? I mean,

772
00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:11.620
even if you do achieve equality, then you have

773
00:44:11.629 --> 00:44:13.750
lesser and lesser steps to take. But it's important

774
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.659
to sort of maintain um equal decision making power

775
00:44:17.669 --> 00:44:20.040
between men and women even once it has been

776
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.620
achieved wherever it has been achieved. And I think

777
00:44:22.629 --> 00:44:25.250
there's just so many domains in which their inequalities

778
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.709
exist. You can say that it's a thing of

779
00:44:27.719 --> 00:44:31.959
the past perhaps in work cultures. But then there's

780
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:37.320
things like which uh sort of professions do. Men

781
00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.350
and women get equal chances in or which academic

782
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.250
disciplines are more represented by women or less represented

783
00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.030
by women or things like household division of labor,

784
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.209
which is something I look at a lot where

785
00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.580
inequalities are still there. So it's not really a

786
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:53.449
thing of the past, it's great that some steps

787
00:44:53.459 --> 00:44:56.000
have been made towards it. But it can't, it

788
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.929
should not become a thing of the past because

789
00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:00.850
even when you reach very equal systems, it takes

790
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.820
work to maintain that equality, I would say, and

791
00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.510
there are still domains where equality has not been

792
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.689
reached in academic disciplines. If you go to the

793
00:45:08.699 --> 00:45:11.449
stem departments or if you, I mean, even in

794
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:14.830
cognitive science departments the gender ratio is very skewed,

795
00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:15.629
I would say

796
00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:19.639
and when it comes to the household division of

797
00:45:19.649 --> 00:45:22.860
labor specifically, o of course, I, I mean, here

798
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.340
in Portugal, we don't compare at all to the

799
00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:30.399
Nordic countries nor anything like that. Uh I mean,

800
00:45:30.409 --> 00:45:33.449
we're really lagging kind but even I would imagine

801
00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:36.419
that even in the Nordic countries, I mean, sometimes

802
00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:40.189
we look at them as the El Dorado of

803
00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:43.340
gender equality and all of that. But I bet

804
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.939
there's still important imbalances there.

805
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.379
Yeah, gender, household, uh sorry, gender division of household

806
00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:53.469
labor is definitely one of the things. So this

807
00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:56.530
is something that I'm looking at uh in the

808
00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.550
most detail, even in the hunter gathering societies and

809
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.169
um in industrialized societies, there is a ton of

810
00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:08.320
sociological data which shows that there has been an

811
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.169
overall rise in men's participation in the household. But

812
00:46:12.179 --> 00:46:15.520
the inequality was so large that it's, it's nowhere

813
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.370
near equal. It's not 50% by each gender whatsoever

814
00:46:19.379 --> 00:46:21.770
and not even in the Nordic countries, maybe in

815
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.719
some households. Sure. But at a level of the

816
00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:27.600
country, no, we are still, we still have a

817
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.810
lot of work to do in that area for

818
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.129
sure.

819
00:46:30.979 --> 00:46:34.129
And what in one of your papers, you explore

820
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:40.909
the economic, cultural and cognitive processes that underlie such

821
00:46:40.929 --> 00:46:44.219
inequality. So co could you tell us about uh

822
00:46:44.229 --> 00:46:46.600
each of them? I mean, uh the economic, I

823
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.979
guess that we've already talked about them a little

824
00:46:48.989 --> 00:46:52.659
bit but particularly the cultural and even more so,

825
00:46:52.669 --> 00:46:56.489
the cognitive processes, what are some of the uh

826
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.879
factors that play a role here?

827
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.219
So, um and so this was a paper that

828
00:47:02.229 --> 00:47:04.969
I was doing a collaboration with a sociologist and

829
00:47:04.979 --> 00:47:08.449
a cognitive psychologist. So we were trying to come

830
00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:11.590
up with our own explanations of why inequalities in

831
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.270
the household specifically in the household um remain. And

832
00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.419
more specifically, we're looking at why a lot of

833
00:47:19.429 --> 00:47:23.030
women who are the disadvantaged parties in the household

834
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.340
continue to find it fair. And uh what the

835
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.590
sociologist has to say is that there is a

836
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.110
huge role of cultural narratives. So if there are

837
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.620
specific narratives about gender roles, uh what is the

838
00:47:36.629 --> 00:47:43.189
hegemonic ideas of masculinity? Feminine, you that's so ingrained

839
00:47:43.199 --> 00:47:45.739
in your brain that you sort of want to

840
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.780
live up to those ideals and those are the,

841
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.129
that sort of division is what you think to

842
00:47:51.139 --> 00:47:54.239
be the expected one and thus the fair one.

843
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.770
And um these sort of ideals and narratives really

844
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:02.090
shape a lot of inequality which women would themselves

845
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.629
then propagate. And the cognitive. Um PSYCHOLOGIST was looking

846
00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:11.840
at how individuals who are clearly having to do

847
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:15.070
more work are able to justify this. Like what's

848
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.750
why are they OK with this? And he was

849
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.719
looking at motivated cognition. So if because you want

850
00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:25.010
to not think of yourself as a victim and

851
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.689
you do not want to introduce uncertainty and imbalance

852
00:48:28.699 --> 00:48:30.729
in your system. So if you're trying to question

853
00:48:30.739 --> 00:48:33.489
the status quo, it will introduce a lot of

854
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.030
uncertainty into your household, into your life, into your

855
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.919
social circles. Um And people have a very strong

856
00:48:40.929 --> 00:48:43.439
preference to not do that. They want to sort

857
00:48:43.449 --> 00:48:47.580
of maintain some semblance of control even though they

858
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.020
don't have it on a larger, if you look

859
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:51.330
at it from a larger scale, but within their

860
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.270
household, they think that, OK, we have decided to,

861
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.629
to do this and thus we will. So it's

862
00:48:55.639 --> 00:48:59.479
almost a little bit self delusional, the stories that

863
00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:02.030
we tell ourselves. And he was uh trying to

864
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.189
come up with this information, theoretic framework of motivated

865
00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:11.110
cognition. Um In simple words, individuals are motivated to

866
00:49:11.469 --> 00:49:14.729
justify their own situations, however unequal, they may be

867
00:49:14.739 --> 00:49:17.590
to be fair um just in order to reduce

868
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.820
the uncertainty from their lives. And yeah, so that

869
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.409
could be one of that's the very individual level

870
00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:26.889
cognitive processes which can sort of continue the perpetuation

871
00:49:26.899 --> 00:49:28.260
of inequalities,

872
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.520
you know. So sometimes uh I wonder when it

873
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:38.939
comes to women who live in unequal circumstances, to

874
00:49:38.949 --> 00:49:43.629
what extent this sort of uh rationalizations, if we

875
00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:47.239
want to call them that help with their well

876
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.399
being because I mean, I wonder if even if

877
00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:54.409
they live in unequal circumstances, they might feel well

878
00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:58.070
with themselves just because they are behaving in ways

879
00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.360
that correspond to the norms of their local group

880
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:05.719
or something like that. So you know, perhaps uh

881
00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.149
I, I know sometimes we can be a little

882
00:50:08.159 --> 00:50:13.495
bit condescending as well when thinking about people like

883
00:50:13.504 --> 00:50:18.014
these because they, they might actually say that they

884
00:50:18.034 --> 00:50:21.294
like living like that. And that might be true,

885
00:50:21.304 --> 00:50:25.614
even though from other perspectives it wouldn't be. But

886
00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:28.155
anyway, do you, do you understand what I'm trying

887
00:50:28.165 --> 00:50:29.064
to say?

888
00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:31.294
I know exactly what you're talking about. So this

889
00:50:31.304 --> 00:50:34.645
perception of fairness and I'm saying, perception of fairness,

890
00:50:34.655 --> 00:50:39.205
not just fairness is super important in justifying the

891
00:50:39.215 --> 00:50:43.120
state of life that you're in. So uh the

892
00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:46.709
motivated cognition person uh which is looking at the

893
00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:50.629
cognitive explanations was trying to look at this. Exactly.

894
00:50:50.639 --> 00:50:54.199
Sometimes you want to ignore information. So let's say

895
00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:57.370
in an experiment, we provide um other men or

896
00:50:57.379 --> 00:51:00.510
other women with the stats of their country of

897
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.659
this is how much work women are doing so

898
00:51:02.669 --> 00:51:05.149
that they are faced with the reality that there

899
00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:08.000
is inequality. Sometimes they, they will be able to

900
00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.770
ignore it, not consciously, but subconsciously, they'll ignore it

901
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:15.290
or they will not want to be faced with

902
00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:19.750
specific forms of information just because they don't want

903
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.389
to feel like they're in a victimized position. And

904
00:51:23.919 --> 00:51:26.610
that sort of self delusion, I mean, in psychological

905
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.820
literature, you call it, it's not a bad thing.

906
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:31.179
It's a, it's a way of living in the

907
00:51:31.189 --> 00:51:33.500
world. And I think all of us have some

908
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:37.520
sort of positive or negative d uh uh what

909
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.800
do you say delusional concepts of the world, we

910
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:41.699
never see the world exactly at it as it

911
00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:44.570
is, we can have an optimistic or pessimistic view

912
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.919
of the world. And this sort of corresponds to

913
00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:49.239
that. So if you think that your situation is

914
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:52.280
fair, you will be in a much happier marriage,

915
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:55.270
your mental health will be a lot better. And

916
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.179
in the case of housing division of labor, they

917
00:51:57.189 --> 00:52:01.919
found that even within similarly unequal divisions of labor,

918
00:52:01.969 --> 00:52:04.770
the people who rate this division of labor to

919
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.120
be fair versus people who rate this division of

920
00:52:07.129 --> 00:52:10.229
labor to be unfair. There's a huge difference in

921
00:52:10.239 --> 00:52:14.979
their overall life, happiness, relationship, happiness, the probability of

922
00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:18.340
divorce their mental health issues. So yeah, if you

923
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:22.439
can think of it in an optimistic way and

924
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:24.449
you can tell yourself that what I'm doing is

925
00:52:24.459 --> 00:52:27.250
what everyone has done. So it's completely fine or

926
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.469
you have any other justifications, you can say that

927
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:31.419
you like to do like you know that you

928
00:52:31.429 --> 00:52:33.760
find a purpose and it's not even wrong because

929
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.360
if you believe it, who is anybody else to

930
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.919
say that it's wrong? So this is uh it

931
00:52:39.929 --> 00:52:42.820
becomes very weird because at the one level, I'm

932
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.729
doing observational studies where I'm bringing in my perspective

933
00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:50.790
of how gender relations should look like. And I

934
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.199
understand that that's a very ethnocentric academic perspective. And

935
00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:57.989
who am I to say anything to the women

936
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.939
or the men who are actually genuinely happy? Because

937
00:53:01.949 --> 00:53:06.590
happiness is only a subjective phenomenological feeling, right? With

938
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.070
whatever divisions they have. So, yeah, I know what

939
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.959
you're talking about and it's really important to understand

940
00:53:12.969 --> 00:53:16.100
what leads to this sort of uh justifications.

941
00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:19.360
Yeah, I, I mean, this sort of uh the

942
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:26.060
questions debates uh are really interesting, particularly among sometimes

943
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.790
even feminists themselves because perhaps some of them would

944
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:36.820
talk about uh patriarchy and the underlying patriarchal structure

945
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:40.865
of a society, the economics of it, the politics

946
00:53:40.875 --> 00:53:44.256
of it, the social structure and all of that.

947
00:53:44.395 --> 00:53:47.426
And they would that definitely, of course, have a

948
00:53:47.436 --> 00:53:51.885
point when saying that reps, there are certain women

949
00:53:52.006 --> 00:53:56.615
that accept the, the gender inequality because they live

950
00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:59.756
in those sorts of contexts. And we should, of

951
00:53:59.766 --> 00:54:02.645
course, they should these already ethics, not really science,

952
00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:05.332
but we should try to help for them for

953
00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:08.751
their emancipation. But on the other hand, I mean,

954
00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:13.491
it is also worth considering arguments uh coming from

955
00:54:13.632 --> 00:54:16.771
other sorts of feminists when they say that, ok,

956
00:54:16.781 --> 00:54:20.951
but you emancipate the women, but then if some

957
00:54:20.961 --> 00:54:24.592
of them still prefer for one reason or the

958
00:54:24.602 --> 00:54:28.750
other to have this sort of marital arrangement, I

959
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.189
mean, that's on them, that's OK because they're making

960
00:54:32.199 --> 00:54:35.330
their own decisions. And if they prefer things like

961
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:39.510
that, I mean, are we to judge them? Right.

962
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.290
Exactly. And I just came across the term very

963
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.300
recently. Choice feminism, which is where you're simply supporting

964
00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.229
choices of women. You're not saying with choice is

965
00:54:49.239 --> 00:54:53.550
better or worse. Uh BUT individuals should be allowed

966
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.239
to make a choice. But I mean, everything, there's

967
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.790
always like so many problems with everything. Choice. Feminism

968
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.770
sounds great. But choices are very much shaped by

969
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.510
the cultural narratives that you've lived in, the cultural

970
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.760
expectations that you've grown up in. So I think

971
00:55:08.969 --> 00:55:11.840
one of the important things, so in this paper

972
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.209
that you brought up where we are looking at

973
00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:18.530
economic cultural cognitive precedence of gender inequality, we say

974
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.500
that we can't say what's right or what's wrong

975
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:24.419
with the policy significance of such work is that

976
00:55:24.429 --> 00:55:28.899
you provide individuals with as large of an information

977
00:55:29.169 --> 00:55:33.449
environment that you can uh women from across the

978
00:55:33.459 --> 00:55:35.709
world should have some way to reach out to

979
00:55:35.719 --> 00:55:37.729
women from other parts of the world. And there,

980
00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:40.669
there should be some communication and there should be

981
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:44.489
a larger informational environment from which individuals can then

982
00:55:45.659 --> 00:55:48.350
make a choice knowing that other choices also existed.

983
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.020
So that, that's when it's a choice, right? When

984
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.929
you know that there's other alternatives that you could

985
00:55:51.939 --> 00:55:56.330
have picked. And it's a very like it's a

986
00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:01.540
very not frustrating. It's a very weird situation where

987
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:03.350
the things that you bring up, but you don't

988
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.110
know exactly what to do because somebody might want

989
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.830
to be a stay at home mom. She does

990
00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:11.139
not wanna work and that's completely fine. But we

991
00:56:11.149 --> 00:56:13.669
don't know why she's thinking that because we know

992
00:56:13.679 --> 00:56:18.219
how individual preferences are completely shaped by our upbringing

993
00:56:18.229 --> 00:56:20.040
and our cultures and everything else.

994
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.889
Yeah. And I mean, of course, I'm not a

995
00:56:22.899 --> 00:56:26.070
woman so I don't have to deal with those

996
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.439
sorts of issues specifically. But I, I mean, I

997
00:56:30.449 --> 00:56:34.919
consider arguments from both sides when it comes to

998
00:56:34.929 --> 00:56:39.229
the feminist spectrum because on the one hand, since

999
00:56:39.239 --> 00:56:42.709
I'm very much into anthropology, I'm very well aware

1000
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:46.070
of all the factors we've talked here about today.

1001
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:50.219
Uh uh WHEN it comes to the economic factors,

1002
00:56:50.229 --> 00:56:53.300
sexual division of labor where it stems from and

1003
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:57.129
all of that. So basically what underlies gender inequality.

1004
00:56:57.139 --> 00:57:01.590
So I, I have a, a fairly good understanding

1005
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.629
of where that comes from. And so I understand

1006
00:57:04.639 --> 00:57:10.409
when uh feminists who are against women accepting certain

1007
00:57:10.419 --> 00:57:14.679
kinds of social roles, uh really accepting them, I

1008
00:57:14.689 --> 00:57:17.370
mean, uh feminists who are against that. But on

1009
00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:20.050
the other hand, I mean, it, I also understand

1010
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:25.389
arguments from so called choice feminists when they say

1011
00:57:25.399 --> 00:57:28.800
that, oh, you're just being condescending as long as

1012
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.000
women make their are allowed to make their own

1013
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.429
choices, they can do whatever they want with their

1014
00:57:33.439 --> 00:57:37.629
lives. Otherwise we're taking agency from them. I mean,

1015
00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:40.280
they're no longer agents who just tell them what

1016
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:43.179
they should do, how they should behave and how

1017
00:57:43.189 --> 00:57:47.040
is that different from patriarchy telling them that they

1018
00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:50.120
should be in the kitchen or something like that.

1019
00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:53.120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you cannot go either way.

1020
00:57:53.129 --> 00:57:57.070
There's, you're losing on both sides then Yeah, exactly.

1021
00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:59.000
I think one of the important things that I

1022
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.479
feel because I, of course I'm reading up constantly

1023
00:58:01.489 --> 00:58:03.159
on it and I'm working on it. One of

1024
00:58:03.169 --> 00:58:06.090
the important things that I feel we could do

1025
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.250
without any argument from either side of feminists is

1026
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:15.879
give every individual, every adult individual, regardless of sex,

1027
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:20.189
whatever sexual orientation, some sort of economic freedom. Because

1028
00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:23.149
if you allow people to be able to fend

1029
00:58:23.159 --> 00:58:25.439
for themselves, then they can have a specific choice.

1030
00:58:25.449 --> 00:58:28.389
I think that sort of everyone would agree with.

1031
00:58:28.399 --> 00:58:33.520
If there's independence of some sort in how well

1032
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:36.340
they can live, then you can have choices. You

1033
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:39.449
can and you'll have emancipation both at the same

1034
00:58:39.459 --> 00:58:43.620
time, I think. And yeah, that's what I find

1035
00:58:43.629 --> 00:58:45.989
with the hunting gathering stuff as well. If you

1036
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.169
look at revolutionary history, that's been one of the

1037
00:58:48.179 --> 00:58:52.679
main precipitator of gender inequality. So I think that's

1038
00:58:52.689 --> 00:58:55.290
an important thing that's important to give to women.

1039
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:59.010
Like don't take away their options by taking away

1040
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.550
their livelihood from them, allow them to be able

1041
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.389
to feed themselves basically.

1042
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:09.239
Yeah. So let me ask you one last question

1043
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.610
and still related to gender inequality. So do you

1044
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.280
think that we can use or we could apply

1045
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:20.629
this knowledge coming from anthropology and even the sort

1046
00:59:20.639 --> 00:59:24.889
of uh processes that we've talked about relating to

1047
00:59:24.939 --> 00:59:28.689
the household, division of labor, the economic culture and

1048
00:59:28.699 --> 00:59:34.570
cognitive processes. Knowledge about that to help reduce uh

1049
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.050
gender inequality.

1050
00:59:38.239 --> 00:59:41.219
Yes, I think academia has a good role to

1051
00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:44.540
play. Um Firstly, uh one thing that I was

1052
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:47.570
saying, if you increase uh the knowledge that women

1053
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.060
have of how women in other parts of the

1054
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:54.800
world behave and live, that's already giving them power

1055
00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:58.860
in terms of opening up their knowledge of uh

1056
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:03.290
how they could possibly potentially live. Um There is

1057
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.290
some really interesting work which one of my collaborators

1058
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.879
is doing where we give. Um So I'm moving

1059
01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.620
away from topic a little bit, but it's a

1060
01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.899
good example of this thing of how we can

1061
01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:18.780
use academia to influence um gender health basically. So

1062
01:00:18.879 --> 01:00:23.389
he's looking at um postpartum depression. So he's working

1063
01:00:23.399 --> 01:00:27.189
with postpartum depression in, in women, of course. Um

1064
01:00:27.199 --> 01:00:30.189
And what they're doing is he's an evolutionary anthropologist

1065
01:00:30.639 --> 01:00:34.750
and in the clinics where mothers go after giving

1066
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.659
birth, they are, they are putting out these pamphlets

1067
01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:43.094
which talks about how women in ancestral society were

1068
01:00:43.104 --> 01:00:46.084
raising their Children. They were not raising Children without

1069
01:00:46.094 --> 01:00:48.814
any social support. They had huge social support. They

1070
01:00:48.824 --> 01:00:51.995
were not the only parents, they usually had a

1071
01:00:52.004 --> 01:00:54.844
lot of other mothers, a lot of other Children,

1072
01:00:54.854 --> 01:00:57.969
a lot of other families helping them out. Basically,

1073
01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.330
to provide the narratives to new mothers that if

1074
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.790
you're feeling helpless as a mom, which is sometimes

1075
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.530
one of the major causes of depression, don't feel

1076
01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.620
like that because humans were not naturally genetically wired

1077
01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:13.969
to be this way. We've always had a very

1078
01:01:13.979 --> 01:01:17.219
strong social connection thing and a mothering has been

1079
01:01:17.229 --> 01:01:19.860
a part of our evolutionary history. So now as

1080
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:22.050
a single parent, when sometimes you feel at loss,

1081
01:01:22.399 --> 01:01:25.020
don't feel that loss and don't go into a

1082
01:01:25.439 --> 01:01:27.919
circle of guilt because of that because we were

1083
01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:31.489
not meant to be so isolated as mothers. And

1084
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.149
that helps, I mean, just having that information, having

1085
01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:37.300
that knowledge that this is not something strange and

1086
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.750
there's an evolutionary reason for it and people, most

1087
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.810
of the time do trust in scientists and what

1088
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.860
they're saying and you can support that with data,

1089
01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:50.340
it really helps to open up their um understanding

1090
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:52.639
of their own selves. And I think that's really

1091
01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:58.850
important. So in uh increasing the information environment that

1092
01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:03.439
people have and making them understand the theoretical underpinnings

1093
01:02:03.449 --> 01:02:08.239
of human behavior can really help them understand why

1094
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.949
they behave in specific ways, be more empathetic to

1095
01:02:10.959 --> 01:02:13.310
the ways the world is and also have more

1096
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.800
choice in bringing changing things around um in their

1097
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:18.830
specific groups.

1098
01:02:19.899 --> 01:02:22.879
Great. So where can people find you and your

1099
01:02:22.889 --> 01:02:24.449
work on the internet?

1100
01:02:25.449 --> 01:02:31.110
Google Scholar, Research Gate academia.edu. And I don't have

1101
01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.300
a website yet, but I will be working on

1102
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:37.409
it soon. But yeah, the main academic forums, Google

1103
01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:39.219
scholar has all of my stuff. So if you

1104
01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.290
put in my name there, you'll come up with

1105
01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.729
all the stuff. And um if you provide show

1106
01:02:44.739 --> 01:02:47.330
note captions, I don't know if you do. My

1107
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.209
email is always, I mean, I'm happy to give

1108
01:02:50.219 --> 01:02:52.169
out my email in case anyone wants to talk

1109
01:02:52.179 --> 01:02:55.280
about anything specific to anything that we've talked about.

1110
01:02:55.699 --> 01:02:58.909
Mhm. Yes, I will leave links to all of

1111
01:02:58.919 --> 01:03:01.909
