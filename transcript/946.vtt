00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.859
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.760
Decent. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.800
the MG by Doctor Elizabeth Anderson. She is mcshay

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.119
professor of Public Philosophy, John Dewey, distinguished University professor

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.299
and Arthur F Feral professor at the University of

6
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.329
Michigan. Her latest book and the book we're talking

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.540
about today. He hijacked how neoliberalism turned the work

8
00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:29.319
ethic against workers and how workers can take it

9
00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:32.180
back. So, Doctor Anderson, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.520
a big pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.450
It's great to be here.

12
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.549
So let's start perhaps uh all the way back

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.849
at the origins of the work ethic or at

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.419
least the work ethic that we're talking here about

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.259
today. So, uh what are the origins of the

16
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.619
protestant work ethic? And what is it exactly?

17
00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.939
So the work ethic was invented by Puritan ministers

18
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.449
in England uh starting in the late 16th century,

19
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.059
but it reached its sort of peak of theory

20
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:13.970
in the 17th century. Uh The Puritans were Calvinists,

21
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.550
so they're very stern, they were the killjoys of

22
00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:23.019
the reformation, not no pleasure here. So that, that

23
00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:30.459
basically what they said was because under Calvinism, everyone

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.410
is predestined by God to be either saved or

25
00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:39.500
damned. Everyone is desperate to know whether they're saved

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.500
and to gain assurance that they are saved. The

27
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.099
parents had said you can't look into your heart,

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.339
right? To tell whether you really have faith that

29
00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.260
Jesus is your savior. Because we're so we have

30
00:01:56.269 --> 00:02:00.489
such a strong motive to deceive ourselves about the

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.180
quality of our faith that we can't rely just

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.258
what we desperately wanted to be true. So the

33
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.008
only way you could tell it through your behavior

34
00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:17.259
and you have to work like crazy. Well, why

35
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.339
would work be a sign of f it's because

36
00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.089
work. God commands all human beings to work to

37
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.360
promote the welfare of our fellow human beings. That

38
00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.699
is what we're placed here on earth to do.

39
00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.550
God has given us all these natural resources, the

40
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.240
earth itself to enable us to help our fellow

41
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.149
human beings on earth and conscientiously working very hard

42
00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.669
and using those natural resources that God gave us

43
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.710
to help our fellow human beings. That's why we're

44
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.820
here and to pursue God's commands faithfully is the

45
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.199
sign that you really have faith in God. Right?

46
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.919
So you have to work really hard. You can't

47
00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:14.699
waste any resources. You're not allowed to waste time

48
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.199
either, right? No idleness here. You're supposed to save

49
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.970
up your earnings. You can't just waste them on

50
00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:29.100
frivolities and luxuries and things like that. Uh You

51
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.210
have to use every penny to promote the real

52
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.570
welfare of our fellow human beings and not, you

53
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.210
know, frivolous junk.

54
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.059
But do you have any idea how exactly these,

55
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.639
I mean, let's call it an ideology for the

56
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.559
time being. We'll come back to that question later

57
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.149
on. But, or how this ideology developed, I mean,

58
00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.970
did it have something to do with, for example,

59
00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:03.880
the advent of capitalism because it suited capitalism as,

60
00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.809
uh, a sort of econo uh new economic uh

61
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.809
structure or was it something about the, I don't

62
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.350
know, the psychological traits of people who like this

63
00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:20.514
kind of ideology, the Calvinist specifically or was it

64
00:04:20.523 --> 00:04:23.553
just something that was already part of the culture

65
00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:26.963
from which Calvinists stemmed? And I mean, these are

66
00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:29.433
just three hypotheses it could be.

67
00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:33.834
So I agree with Max Weber who wrote the

68
00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:37.403
original scholarly study of the Protestant work ethic. It's

69
00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:40.273
called the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

70
00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:44.200
And what we said is the Protestant ethic. The

71
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:48.649
work ethic predates modern capitalism as we know it

72
00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.690
in the 17th century. It wasn't yet on the

73
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.320
scene. So he reads the puritans and I agree

74
00:04:55.329 --> 00:05:01.890
with him as fundamentally theologically oriented. Ok. It's really

75
00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.730
all about God and God's commands for human beings

76
00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:08.440
and hope for salvation and things like that. Um

77
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.929
And what Baber said was despite the fact that

78
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.320
their aims were Godly and oth otherworldly because it

79
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:21.510
promoted an ethic of disciplined labor. It set the

80
00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:26.570
stage for capitalism, modern capitalism as we know it,

81
00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:30.559
that is capitalism that's based on highly disciplined, highly

82
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.440
organized wage labor and enduring uh workers to the

83
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.619
drudgery of the industrial revolution. It kind of, it,

84
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.399
it kind of set the stage to enable the

85
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.700
industrial revolution to leap forward. But that didn't happen

86
00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:48.940
until the 18th century.

87
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.709
And is there any relationship between the work ethic

88
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.829
and utilitarianism? And if so, what would it be?

89
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.760
Absolutely. So the puritans invented utilitarianism. There's a wonderful

90
00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:09.100
Puritan theologian Richard Baxter who still studied today in

91
00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:17.570
seminaries, by the way, uh he formulated the first

92
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.559
real statement of what is known today as act

93
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.470
utilitarianism. He said, give it a choice between promoting

94
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.130
a greater or a lesser good. You have a

95
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.329
strict duty to promote the greater good. And keep

96
00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.790
in mind that one of the axioms of uh

97
00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.799
the church of England, which was theologically Calvinist is

98
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:42.250
that there's no such thing as super Arrogation of

99
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.970
doing anything beyond the call of duty right now.

100
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.410
You have to maximize the good, right and you're

101
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.079
slipping, it's, it's simple to do anything short of

102
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.299
that. And you can see some of the same

103
00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:00.529
moral rigor is among utilitarians today. If you look

104
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.290
at, say somebody like Peter singer, even though undoubtedly

105
00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:08.089
he's made immense amounts of money on his books

106
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.779
and lectures and so forth. But he lives a

107
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.350
very frugal life just as those Calvinist thought he

108
00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:18.709
should. And, and he's, and he's dedicated most of

109
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.859
his income to charity, which is exactly what Baxter

110
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.329
said should be done with all that wealth you're

111
00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:28.049
accumulating from all that hard work you're doing.

112
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.269
So, perhaps some of these, uh, I mean, original

113
00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:40.329
work ethicists would be into things like effective altruism

114
00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:41.200
if they were alive.

115
00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:46.829
Baxter was already there. And what's remarkable is Baxter

116
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:53.029
actually has a wonderful, uh claim that exactly parallels

117
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.459
an argument that Peter Singer in, in advocating for

118
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.589
altruism, uh effective altruism made back at, I can't

119
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.829
remember 1980 something. Uh, SINGER'S analogy was, well, suppose

120
00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:11.179
you see a drowning child in a pond, shouldn't

121
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.950
you ruin your business suit and your nice shoes

122
00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:16.320
and weighed in there to rescue the child from

123
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.600
death even though it's gonna cost you your nice

124
00:08:19.609 --> 00:08:23.320
clothing. And Baxter essentially said the same thing in

125
00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:27.260
his Christian directory, his comprehensive guide to a Christian

126
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:32.169
living in which he said you should give up

127
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.520
the fancy clothing of your wife and Children and

128
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.719
not obtain for them anything more than plain clothing

129
00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.520
so that you can dedicate that money to save

130
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.359
the poor.

131
00:08:47.869 --> 00:08:52.299
Yeah. So I, I mean, uh one very interesting

132
00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:56.570
thing here is that, of course, uh today, there's

133
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.520
uh at least one general idea that is that

134
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.219
we tend to associate the work ethic with conservatism

135
00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:09.130
and the political, right? Mostly. But since we're also

136
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.169
going to go through some of the intellectual history,

137
00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:15.599
intellectual background here over the course of the last

138
00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:19.989
few centuries. Is there or has there been a

139
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.809
progressive slash uh left wing version of the work

140
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.409
ethic?

141
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.539
Yes. So that's exactly the key arguments of my

142
00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:34.469
book is that, yes, there was a conservative work

143
00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:40.010
ethic and Max Weber characterized it accurately. It's nose

144
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.109
to the grindstone for the workers to the maximum

145
00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:47.179
profit of the capitalist. That's the regime we're living

146
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.070
under now. We call it neoliberalism, but it's basically

147
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.409
just the modern work ethic. But the, the key

148
00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.919
discovery I've made is that Faber was only half,

149
00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:00.520
right? That if you go back to the puritans,

150
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.500
you can actually see traces of a much more

151
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.719
progressive and uplifting story about workers. The point of

152
00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:13.210
the work ethic on earth, not just to help

153
00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:16.099
our fellow human beings, but also to exalt the

154
00:10:16.109 --> 00:10:19.849
status of workers. They're doing God's work. In other

155
00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.789
words, what puritans are saying is, it's not just

156
00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:26.419
the preachers or the priests who are doing God's

157
00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:32.140
work, every worker is doing God's work. And so

158
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.659
they have to be honored on that account. And

159
00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:38.460
what does that honoring amount to? Well, you had

160
00:10:38.469 --> 00:10:43.150
to pay fair and living wages. Workers are entitled

161
00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:45.630
to a free choice of occupation. You can't just

162
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.789
force them to work at something you want them

163
00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:51.619
to do. Uh So they have a certain amount

164
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.380
of autonomy. You're not allowed to just boss them

165
00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:00.960
around tyrannically. You have to treat your employees with

166
00:11:00.969 --> 00:11:06.119
love and care and concern, provide safe working conditions.

167
00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:10.520
And it's, it's that what I call the progressive

168
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.440
or pro worker work ethic that got developed through

169
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:21.409
the 18th century, a among the political economists competing

170
00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:25.979
with or arguing with the conservative political economists who

171
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:28.570
had this very harsh view that they wanted to

172
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.119
impose on ordinary workers. Uh And so I read

173
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.679
the history of classical political economy from Locke and

174
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:43.969
Smith on right through Marx. Uh AND Edward Bernstein

175
00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:49.789
an unknown hero, social democracy. Uh THAT whole history,

176
00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:53.830
I read as an argument between the conservative and

177
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.349
the progressive work ethic advocates. And once you see,

178
00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:01.030
once you read the text in light of the

179
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:03.469
work ethic, it all falls into place and makes

180
00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.260
sense. Yes.

181
00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:10.659
OK. So going a few centuries back, uh one

182
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:15.450
of the most prominent figures whose work you explore

183
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.059
in the book is John Locke. So what does

184
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.150
John Locke have to do with the work ethic?

185
00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:25.219
I mean, what did he have to say about

186
00:12:25.229 --> 00:12:25.500
it?

187
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.179
Yeah. So keep in mind that Locke is writing

188
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.679
only a couple of decades after the end of

189
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:40.340
the English Civil War. And Richard Baxter actually marched

190
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:44.280
with the parliamentary army against the king. He was

191
00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:47.000
a chaplain to the army. OK. So we know

192
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:53.010
whose side he was on. And Locke basically famously

193
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:58.250
advanced a labor theory of property. So in the

194
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.349
state of nature, the only way to get a

195
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:03.450
just claim to property is to work it, right?

196
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.260
You have to be growing something on it, making

197
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:12.349
it productive. It's a very calvinist idea, right? And

198
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.780
then you, you get to own that property in

199
00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:18.150
virtue of the fact that you're, that you're basically

200
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.859
enacting God's will and helping your fellow human beings

201
00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:28.400
by, right, making the earth productive, be fruitful and

202
00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:34.969
multiply, right? That's God's command. And um he advanced

203
00:13:34.979 --> 00:13:39.679
this ethic, I argue uh to justify uh the

204
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:46.460
constitutional claims of the Levelers who uh advanced a

205
00:13:46.469 --> 00:13:50.900
very radical uh constitutional agenda during the English Civil

206
00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:57.059
war. They wanted to abolish uh the privileges of

207
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.940
the Lords abolish the House of Lords, put everyone

208
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.940
on common law. So keep in mind when we

209
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.609
talk about common law today, we assume that everybody

210
00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:10.280
is subject to common law. But back in those

211
00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:13.669
days, the Lords had their own set of laws

212
00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.520
that they passed in the House of Lords that

213
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.909
were just for themselves, right? And they could not

214
00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:25.289
be tried by commoners. They were tried by peers,

215
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.309
peers, of course, were fellow members of the House

216
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.409
of Lords, right? And so they had all these

217
00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:34.679
privileges and, and commoners couldn't sue them. They were

218
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:39.380
totally unaccountable. Like you couldn't trust a contract between

219
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.130
a lord and yourself if you were a commoner

220
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.270
because the Lord could just like take whatever you

221
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.520
made like a tailor might be, make some fine

222
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.460
dresses and suits and so forth and then not

223
00:14:49.469 --> 00:14:52.030
pay you and the tailor would be out all

224
00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:55.929
of that money and cut it to the Lord,

225
00:14:55.989 --> 00:15:02.000
right? So the Levelers and then Locke argued for

226
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.750
equality under the law. Very important. You don't have

227
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.900
different classes of people where one has special privileges

228
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.380
over the other. And also for the primacy of

229
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.380
parliament, right. Parliament makes the laws, not the king

230
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.289
and the king can't even veto those laws, right.

231
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:25.179
And so lacks constitutional proposals are the Levelers. So

232
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.669
the Levelers were explicitly arguing on behalf of the

233
00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:34.289
common ordinary welcome against the lords who were oppressing

234
00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:36.750
them. And of course, the king who was taxing

235
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.580
them and doing other awful things.

236
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.549
And one of the things you explore in the

237
00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:48.270
book is the initial intellectual developments that led to

238
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.429
conservatives hijacking the concept of the work ethic and

239
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.950
turning it against the workers. And of course, we

240
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.460
don't have of course time uh to go through

241
00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:02.864
every single one of these figures, like for example,

242
00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:06.724
Priestly Malthus Burke and others. But could you tell

243
00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:11.775
us perhaps uh in a summarized way what these

244
00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:17.984
intellectual developments were and how exactly did they turn

245
00:16:17.994 --> 00:16:20.784
the work ethic against the workers?

246
00:16:21.255 --> 00:16:25.184
Yes. So just keep in mind that what happens

247
00:16:25.195 --> 00:16:30.280
during the industrial revolution is a split between what

248
00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.789
I call a conservative work ethic, which is basically

249
00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:36.640
the property owners or the capitalist work ethic and

250
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.169
the uh progressive work ethic, which is a work

251
00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:44.760
ethic advanced by uh and on behalf of workers.

252
00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:48.250
Now, if you look at the original work ethic.

253
00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:51.289
What it does is it unites the rights and

254
00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:53.690
the duties of workers. Workers have to work really

255
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.969
hard, but then they're entitled to reap the fruits

256
00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:58.969
of their labor, right? You get the benefits for

257
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:02.090
performing the duties here on earth, not just waiting

258
00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:07.680
for the next life. Um But during the industrial

259
00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:12.380
revolution and the way the puritans could make that

260
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.550
unity possible is that their model workers were manual

261
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.800
workers who also had property claims. The yeoman farmer

262
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.329
either owned his own plot of land or had

263
00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.660
a long, very long lease on it. Uh The

264
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.099
merchant uh owns his own shop but was also

265
00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:34.459
manually crafting manufactured items like shoes and so forth.

266
00:17:34.989 --> 00:17:39.599
Um So the rights and duties were naturally unified

267
00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:42.280
in the 17th century in the typical or model

268
00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.310
puritan worker. Uh But by the industrial revolution, you

269
00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:50.030
see a radical split where workers become wage laborers

270
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.000
with no property at all or no claims on

271
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.390
property income, a capital income. Uh BECAUSE the machines

272
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.680
are too big and expensive for them to own

273
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:04.140
capitalists on those things, the factories and so forth,

274
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.270
right? The workers are impoverished and similar things happened

275
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.520
in agriculture too, which is very important. The workers

276
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.160
lost access to land, they could no longer lease

277
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.079
their own land. The the the big landlords basically

278
00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:22.699
gobbled it all up often by force of parliament

279
00:18:22.709 --> 00:18:28.689
just forced sales. Um So the workers are impoverished

280
00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:32.079
now and have only their wages to rely on

281
00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:35.239
in order to survive. So and, and so you

282
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.430
have to, because the work ethic is the dominant

283
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:44.369
conceptual scheme, but a normative scheme in England at

284
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.880
the time, everybody had to fit their preferred mode

285
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.869
of social organization within the terms of the work

286
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.819
ethic because that was just the dominant ideology. So,

287
00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:58.250
although the workers work ethic, I think has a

288
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.349
natural unity to it. Uh WHERE the rights and

289
00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:05.420
duties go hand in hand, the capitalists had to

290
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.209
explain how they get all the, all the benefits

291
00:19:08.219 --> 00:19:10.750
of the work ethic, right? The workers get all

292
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.000
the duties, right? And so the way they did

293
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.859
this to move quite quickly through, uh the basic

294
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:26.630
theory was of the Conservatives that poor workers would

295
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.479
not willingly work hard. Uh EXCEPT if they were

296
00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:36.270
forced to under conditions of poverty and precarity. OK.

297
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.530
And so to make them do their duty to

298
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.410
work hard, right? You have to stick them in

299
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.010
those positions. But also perhaps to give them some

300
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.099
promise that if they do work hard and save

301
00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:50.199
and practice these other work ethic virtues, then maybe

302
00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:51.880
they could become rich, at least they'll have a

303
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:57.839
shot at that. So, and what that means then

304
00:19:57.849 --> 00:20:01.359
that the key problem for the Conservatives is that

305
00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:06.069
there was a poor law in England. It's basically

306
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:10.709
a national run welfare system under which the deeply

307
00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:17.680
impoverished could claim some handouts from the government typically

308
00:20:17.689 --> 00:20:21.140
in cash that they could use to survive. And

309
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.959
of course, that comes right from the effective altruism

310
00:20:23.969 --> 00:20:27.339
part of the puritans only they thought it was

311
00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:30.180
a strict duty to give so you can tax

312
00:20:30.189 --> 00:20:32.920
people to do it. It's not voluntary, right. You

313
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.130
have to be an effective altruist. So it's ok

314
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.489
to tax you to do that. So, but they

315
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.010
hated the poor law because they imagined it turns

316
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.660
out falsely that it gave an outlet for lazy

317
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:51.239
idlers to live off the public fisk rather than

318
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.910
working hard. Ok. Now, this is completely false, but

319
00:20:55.939 --> 00:20:59.170
that's what they imagined. And so we have a

320
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:06.650
variety of schemes then to somehow eliminate or radically

321
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.239
change the work ethic to make sure that lazy

322
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.109
people can't just live off our hard earned tax

323
00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:18.770
dollars. Ok. So Priestley's idea is you abolish the

324
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.880
poor law and you enroll workers in a forced

325
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.300
savings plan where they had to save for any

326
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:28.469
possible accidents in their retirement, out of their own

327
00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:37.479
wages. Ok. Um Benson's thought, well, we, we can't

328
00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:41.609
have people just get cash without having to work

329
00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:44.689
in return and we can't leave them at their

330
00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:48.079
liberty because, you know, if they're poor, they're probably

331
00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:53.630
doing shady things. So we have to uh put

332
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.560
them all in a panopticon, a prison panopticon and

333
00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:03.560
force them to work in return for their food

334
00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:06.640
and, you know, room board dress and so forth

335
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:16.770
under humiliating and totalitarian conditions. Moth is thought let's

336
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.010
gradually phase out the core loss, you announce it

337
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.050
in advance. So people have plenty of time to

338
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.699
prepare. Right. And, and then, you know, I then

339
00:22:28.709 --> 00:22:32.359
that will force people to be prudent to save,

340
00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:35.880
to delay child rearing to childbearing until they can

341
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.469
afford it to delay marriage until they can afford

342
00:22:38.479 --> 00:22:42.189
Children and so forth. Right. And then we won't

343
00:22:42.199 --> 00:22:46.150
need, we won't need the poor law anymore because

344
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.439
it will force people to be prudent and adopt

345
00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:52.760
the work ethic virtues, you know, working hard saving

346
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.670
prudence. Looking ahead, not having, you know, more kids

347
00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.500
than you can afford and so forth. Haley is

348
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:07.209
arguing against envy of the of, of the better

349
00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:11.670
off. He says, look, you workers, you think you

350
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.410
have it so hard. But in reality, it's the

351
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.739
lords who have life really hard because they're wringing

352
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.750
their hands all the time on how they can

353
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.119
find adequate positions for their 2nd, 3rd and 4th

354
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.979
born sons under the laws of inheritance. At the

355
00:23:29.989 --> 00:23:34.270
time, the firstborn son would inherit everything. And so

356
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.939
the fathers then had right, this desperate scramble to

357
00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:43.900
find positions that were, you know, had enough dignity

358
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.979
to them for uh the lower born sons, the

359
00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:51.239
later born sons, so that they wouldn't fall into

360
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:58.510
a catastrophe. And then Burke and Whateley uh Burke

361
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.839
advance the idea that workers are entitled to nothing

362
00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:09.209
more than exactly what the market gives them. Ok?

363
00:24:09.219 --> 00:24:12.680
So if they starve under the market level wage.

364
00:24:12.689 --> 00:24:15.189
Well, that's too bad. Right. There shouldn't be any

365
00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:18.949
poor law to supplement that. Right. So, keep Burke

366
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:23.699
here and Malthus are very close together. Um, AND

367
00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:31.520
lately invented European imperialism, the ideology of European imperialism

368
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:39.000
on biblical grounds. So, he was a theologian and

369
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:44.910
lately believed that, uh, uh God had already given

370
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.609
the gifts of agriculture to human beings after their

371
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:52.199
expulsion from the Garden of Eden. And so if

372
00:24:52.209 --> 00:24:54.689
you come across a people who are backward and

373
00:24:54.699 --> 00:24:58.619
don't even have, you know, agriculture and herding and

374
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.670
uh uh you know, working advanced metallurgy and this

375
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.290
kind of stuff, then it must have been that

376
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:12.290
they've slipped back due to their idleness. And consequently,

377
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.670
it's the, it's, it's, you know, the burden of

378
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.829
the civilized, the most civilized that is the Europeans

379
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:22.670
to lift them up by ruling over them, right?

380
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.109
And that's really right, the white man's burden is

381
00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:26.739
coming straight out of Whateley,

382
00:25:27.729 --> 00:25:33.349
a another burden by the way, another burden because

383
00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:37.589
earlier, for example, you mentioned the fact that the

384
00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:41.040
capitalists, the business owners and all of that, the

385
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.089
factory owners have that burden of trying to distribute

386
00:25:45.209 --> 00:25:50.089
things through among their 2nd, 3rd and 4th son

387
00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:50.900
and whatever.

388
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.849
Exactly.

389
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.569
So, so yeah, so, uh ok, so perhaps uh

390
00:25:56.579 --> 00:26:01.339
there's many things there that interestingly enough ring a

391
00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:04.939
lot of different bells because they start to sound

392
00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:10.260
very curiously close to uh neo liberalism.

393
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.300
But we'll get,

394
00:26:12.349 --> 00:26:15.400
but, but we'll get there. We'll get. Ok. So

395
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.530
there are two other specific, uh, I guess, standards,

396
00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:22.219
I guess we could call them of the work

397
00:26:22.229 --> 00:26:25.910
ethic and more specifically the conservative work ethic that

398
00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.729
I would like to ask you about and the

399
00:26:27.739 --> 00:26:30.880
progressive version of it, we're going to get into

400
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.619
it in just a bit. But, uh, what about,

401
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:40.170
uh, the, what about independence and personal responsibility? I

402
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.560
mean, when exactly were those two aspects of the

403
00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:49.250
work ethic introduced? And what role do they play

404
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.479
there? Exactly.

405
00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:56.589
Yes. So independence and personal responsibility are terms that

406
00:26:56.599 --> 00:27:00.569
are introduced in the late 18th century with the

407
00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:06.380
rise of the conservative work ethic. Uh AND independence

408
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:14.369
basically means not receiving uh means tested welfare benefits

409
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:20.229
from the state. That's all it means because of

410
00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:24.670
course, it can't mean for the Conservatives getting money

411
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.050
that you haven't earned by working for it since

412
00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:33.400
they're all recipients of capital income. And indeed the

413
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.349
inventor of this idea of independence priestly conceded that

414
00:27:39.589 --> 00:27:43.030
the rich by which he meant the landlords and

415
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.530
other recipients of passive capital income, fairly dependent, their

416
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.589
own standard of living matter of stigmatizing, receipt of

417
00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:58.930
means tested welfare benefits. The idea of personal responsibility

418
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:05.750
I think is ambiguous because it means two things.

419
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.670
One thing that it means is you have to

420
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.489
bear the costs and benefits of the consequences of

421
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.180
your own conduct where those costs and benefits are

422
00:28:20.189 --> 00:28:26.280
determined by the market. And so responsibility in this

423
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.430
sense is just who's gonna bear the costs. Uh

424
00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:34.239
But then there's another sense of personal responsibility, which

425
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.270
is the assumption that if you are bearing a

426
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.890
lot of costs like you are very poor, it

427
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.569
must be because you were in some sense, irresponsible,

428
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.469
not prudent, not obeying the dictates of the work

429
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:53.449
ethic, not working hard enough, having too many kids

430
00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:57.920
before you're able to afford to raise them things

431
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.869
like that. And so that notion of personal responsibility

432
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.569
as the opposite of irresponsibility is a way to

433
00:29:06.579 --> 00:29:09.989
blame the poor for their misfortunes.

434
00:29:11.829 --> 00:29:16.170
So before we get into the progressive version of

435
00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.910
the work ethic and some of the biggest names

436
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.209
associated with it, uh Let's talk here a little

437
00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:26.689
bit about some of the political applications that the

438
00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:30.050
conservative work ethic first had. So for example, in

439
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.609
the book, you go through things like the English

440
00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:37.969
welfare reform, the Irish Poor law, the Irish famine

441
00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:40.989
policy. Could you tell us a little bit about

442
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.319
that? I mean, I, in what ways did the

443
00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:47.530
conservative work ethic? Uh I mean, from uh that

444
00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.619
was I guess originally a philosophy in what ways

445
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.880
did it translate into actual policy?

446
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.739
Uh What I argue is that a prime implication

447
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.510
of the conservative work ethic is an extreme skepticism

448
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.729
and very stinting attitude towards public welfare benefits for

449
00:30:08.739 --> 00:30:13.250
the poor. Uh THAT the poor are just trying

450
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.630
to be lazy and lie in a hammock while

451
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:24.229
they consume taxpayer funding there's a a punitive attitude

452
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:28.040
towards anyone who falls into a condition of neediness.

453
00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.770
And that leads to an inclination for some kind

454
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.859
of imprisonment of the poor and subjection to forced

455
00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:41.869
labor. So you have the invention of the workhouse,

456
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.530
which already it sort of existed in the 17th

457
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.209
century but not, they were considered houses of correction

458
00:30:49.219 --> 00:30:53.219
and they were temporary lodgings where somebody who is

459
00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:56.770
say, begging on the streets without a permit might

460
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.449
be said to be whipped and then, you know,

461
00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:04.339
sent on their way. Uh BUT workhouses in the,

462
00:31:04.349 --> 00:31:07.479
in the 18th century, it become a serious matter

463
00:31:07.489 --> 00:31:10.319
where you could even be consigned for life once

464
00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:14.719
you were destitute and they were designed to be

465
00:31:14.729 --> 00:31:20.739
incredibly punitive and harsh. And in the late 18th

466
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.229
century, the welfare roles are increasing and they continue

467
00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:30.800
to increase in the early 19th century. Malthusian panic

468
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.310
erupts. There's this idea that the poor are just

469
00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:36.949
breeding like rabbits and they're going to overwhelm everyone

470
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.609
and and just ask for, you know, more and

471
00:31:40.619 --> 00:31:43.349
more and eat up all the rents. That was

472
00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:47.550
the great worry that the landlords because taxation to

473
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.859
support the poor law was on uh land, right?

474
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:56.150
It would be the landowners who ultimately bore that

475
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.859
cost. And they were worried that all the rents

476
00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:01.880
would just be eaten up with welfare tax payments.

477
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.109
So they became very punitive as a means of

478
00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:10.900
deterring uh the poor from even applying for benefits

479
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:18.140
and punishing them if they were allowed. And so

480
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.339
the workhouses were basically prisons. People lost all civil

481
00:32:22.349 --> 00:32:26.599
rights. They were subjected to more demeaning conditions even

482
00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:29.729
than criminals. So for instance, criminals would get a

483
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:35.109
spoon. Right. But they, but, but the people in

484
00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:37.979
the poor houses had to eat with their hands.

485
00:32:38.939 --> 00:32:43.890
Oh my God, deliberately humiliating. Right. And that's a

486
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.609
deterrence. And it's also a test of whether they're

487
00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:50.560
really needy because no one would ever accept these

488
00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:54.959
conditions if they could have any other way of

489
00:32:54.969 --> 00:33:01.949
scrounging a living. So in uh 1832 in England,

490
00:33:01.969 --> 00:33:05.969
uh parliament passes a welfare reform in which they

491
00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:10.900
declare that everyone who claims aid has to enter

492
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.609
a workhouse as a condition of getting it. This

493
00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:19.560
was never realistic because workhouses were way more expensive

494
00:33:20.719 --> 00:33:24.380
then uh just giving cash handouts to people who

495
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:29.089
stayed in their cottages. Um And of course, there

496
00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:32.160
was always outrage at the extreme cruelty of the

497
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:37.849
workhouses. So they were very unpopular. Uh And, and

498
00:33:37.859 --> 00:33:41.670
so welfare policy gyrates between the hyper punitive and

499
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.510
the lower cost because the landlords also didn't want

500
00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.290
to pay higher taxes. You never really had a

501
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.880
stable regime. They keep on going back and forth

502
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:56.579
on that. Uh And then in Ireland, the situation

503
00:33:56.589 --> 00:34:03.579
was somewhat different because there the uh the conservative

504
00:34:03.589 --> 00:34:07.439
work ethic people in parliament thought that the Irish

505
00:34:07.449 --> 00:34:12.659
landlords as well as the Irish peasants were exceptionally

506
00:34:12.668 --> 00:34:18.958
lazy, lacked industrious industriousness, they lacked frugality they would

507
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.208
just be spendthrifts and waste all their rents on

508
00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:27.739
high living. These were stereotypes and the English thought

509
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.620
that they had perfected modern agriculture by adopting a

510
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:36.489
capitalist system of agriculture. And so their project for

511
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.969
welfare reform in Ireland was basically to force the

512
00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:44.889
landlords to bear the costs of welfare uh for

513
00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:49.188
the poor in order to force them to get

514
00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:54.217
more efficient and productive on their estates. And the

515
00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:59.579
capitalist model would eliminate the peasantry instead of peasants,

516
00:34:59.589 --> 00:35:02.438
each farming their own plot of land to farm

517
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:05.669
their own food. They would be reduced to wage

518
00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:10.669
laborers, landless and effectively destitute to make them work

519
00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:13.560
harder because they're desperate every day to find a

520
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.770
means to provide for themselves and their families. So

521
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.070
they're really gonna work hard. That was the theory.

522
00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:26.719
Uh And, and so they imposed on Ireland some

523
00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:33.060
requirements to create a poor law which hadn't really

524
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:37.479
been in existence before, mainly to burden the landlords

525
00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:39.820
and force them to get more productive and efficient

526
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.820
by adopting a capitalist system. And then when the

527
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:47.629
Irish famine struck, that was due to a potato

528
00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:51.580
blight. Uh AND potatoes were the main uh crop

529
00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:55.320
that fed a very high percentage of the Irish,

530
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.800
especially in the rural areas. Uh People started starving

531
00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:05.989
and welfare policy. Famine relief policy was run from

532
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
the Treasury Department in London. And uh people in

533
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.689
parliament thought that this was a wonderful opportunity to

534
00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:18.239
clear the estates of all those lazy peasants who

535
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:23.629
could simply before they would be able to plant

536
00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:27.159
a quarter acre with potatoes and feed a large

537
00:36:27.169 --> 00:36:31.219
family on that tiny little plot and potatoes pretty

538
00:36:31.229 --> 00:36:35.340
much grow with very little tending, tending. So, uh,

539
00:36:35.389 --> 00:36:39.540
they didn't, they weren't working as hard, right. Um

540
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:48.219
And so, uh, and so the conservative work ethic

541
00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:52.219
advocates saw the famine as a wonderful opportunity to

542
00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:55.429
clear the estates of peasants. Hopefully they go elsewhere

543
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:59.399
if they didn't starve. And indeed millions went to

544
00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:04.379
the United States, Canada, Australia where wherever they could

545
00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:08.760
manage, many, you know, many others died. And this

546
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:14.080
was uh our path to forcing a capitalist system

547
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.320
of agriculture on Ireland. At least that was the

548
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.469
thought and consequently famine relief, although it was practiced

549
00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:27.159
was extremely stingy and many devices were invented to

550
00:37:27.169 --> 00:37:33.360
uh reduce the peasants to absolute destitution and to

551
00:37:34.209 --> 00:37:37.229
make it almost impossible for them to get aid.

552
00:37:39.969 --> 00:37:44.070
And so on the other hand, what were the

553
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:49.760
main ideas of people like Adam Smith, David Ricardo

554
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.989
and the other Ricard and socialists that can be

555
00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:58.389
classified as a progressive work ethic. And what are

556
00:37:58.399 --> 00:38:01.350
some of the main ways in which it differs

557
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.669
from uh the conservative version of the work ethic.

558
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.419
Yeah. So um just recall that in the late

559
00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:12.610
18th century, the work ethic splits between a pro

560
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:20.879
worker and a pro uh uh capitalist version. Conservatives

561
00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:24.659
give us the pro capitalist version. Uh But then

562
00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:27.510
the people I call progressives because they all believe

563
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.959
in progress. Uh And they have a certain view

564
00:38:31.969 --> 00:38:35.729
of what it takes to get progress. Um They're,

565
00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:38.290
they're on the pro worker side. And so that

566
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.520
includes Adam Smith to a certain degree, David Ricardo,

567
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.820
some of ambiguous figure, but there was a group

568
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:49.379
of so called Ricard and socialists who took some

569
00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:54.689
of Ricardo's ideas to their logical conclusion. Uh John

570
00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:59.360
Stuart Mill and ultimately, even Karl Marx are on

571
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:03.510
the pro worker or progressive side. The critical difference

572
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.800
that the progressives have with the uh conservatives is

573
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:14.379
in their attitudes towards poor workers. The conservatives thought

574
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.320
workers, poor workers would quit as soon as they

575
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:23.050
got enough to survive, they would quit working. The

576
00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.689
progressives all thought, look, if you, if you pay

577
00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:29.649
them decently, they'll be and give them a reasonable

578
00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:33.870
prospect of improving their lot in life, that will

579
00:39:33.879 --> 00:39:36.830
be an incentive for them to work harder. So

580
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:42.429
you have a split between uh the incentives that

581
00:39:42.439 --> 00:39:46.429
we assume the poor have. Right? One thinks to

582
00:39:46.439 --> 00:39:48.979
make them work hard, they have to be in

583
00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:52.979
a situation of poverty and precarity. And the other

584
00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:57.699
side says, no, give them realistic prospects for improving

585
00:39:57.709 --> 00:40:00.120
their condition and they will work as hard as

586
00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:04.219
you want them to work. But also there's another

587
00:40:04.229 --> 00:40:07.820
fundamental difference in attitude towards the poor. And here

588
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.860
the poor of course, were the vast majority of

589
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.760
workers. The middle class was still very, very, very

590
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:17.239
tiny Yeah. Uh, A and, and that just has

591
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:24.110
to do with, um, whether you trust the poor

592
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:30.429
to use their freedom wisely. So, the conservatives were

593
00:40:30.439 --> 00:40:34.489
forever wringing their hands over the imprudence. They imagined

594
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.550
the poor had that they're having reckless sex and

595
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.500
having too many babies and so forth. But, uh,

596
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:47.050
for the progressives, how people behave is fundamentally a

597
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.780
feature of the incentives that they face and you

598
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:56.939
could arrange positive incentives in such a way that

599
00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:00.790
people will both work hard and be prudent in

600
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.560
other ways. They'll save money, they'll do, they'll practice

601
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.100
all of the work ethic virtues if you give

602
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:11.439
them positive opportunities. Uh And, and so you can

603
00:41:11.449 --> 00:41:16.290
trust workers to promote the, their self interest and

604
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.409
the interests of their families under a properly organized

605
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.770
uh system of social institutions, especially property arrangements.

606
00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:31.810
Mhm. Uh You know, one before we go on

607
00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.949
one of the reasons why I was laughing a

608
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.129
little bit when you mentioned the ideas that some

609
00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:41.949
of the more conservative people have about the poor

610
00:41:41.959 --> 00:41:47.429
and the destitute and particularly them having more Children

611
00:41:47.439 --> 00:41:51.050
than they should uh in, in their mind. Of

612
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.659
course, uh uh is that I I it sounds

613
00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:57.879
really close to some of the ideas that we

614
00:41:57.889 --> 00:42:02.419
heard and still here, unfortunately, from the eugenicists, for

615
00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:07.199
example, because I mean, it's always this idea that,

616
00:42:07.209 --> 00:42:11.070
oh my God, poor people, uh the low IQ

617
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.100
people, for example, in the 20th century. And now

618
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:16.820
people talk about a lot about IQ, for example,

619
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.169
low IQ people are having so much chil, uh,

620
00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:23.629
so many Children. Uh, AND, uh, it's, uh, a

621
00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:27.939
disaster and stuff like that. Uh, I mean, it's,

622
00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:32.090
it's always, it, I, I laugh because these ideas

623
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.889
are not as original as probably many, many people

624
00:42:36.899 --> 00:42:37.739
might think.

625
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.860
Oh, absolutely. I mean, when it comes to welfare

626
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:45.120
policy, arguments in, uh, the United States and to

627
00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:49.850
a great extent, also in uh uh the UK

628
00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:55.280
Conservatives haven't thought a new thought about welfare policy

629
00:42:55.379 --> 00:43:04.070
since Malthus, they continue to repeat the same uh

630
00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.889
uh denigrating and suspicious ideas about the poor, regardless

631
00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:14.169
of enormous amounts of counter evidence against their assumptions.

632
00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:18.449
So now we have literally hundreds of experiments of

633
00:43:18.459 --> 00:43:22.770
a basic income where you just hand poor people

634
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.790
cash on a monthly basis and see how they

635
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.570
do. And overwhelmingly, they're not just lying back and

636
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.270
quitting work, but rather they're using that money to

637
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.610
improve their condition precisely as uh Adam Smith thought

638
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.050
they would, you know, they're going out there, they're

639
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.689
using the money to uh you know, get more

640
00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:49.360
education, maybe to start a business. Uh BASICALLY there

641
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.899
that it gives them a longer time horizon with

642
00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:56.709
which they can plan because they don't just have

643
00:43:56.719 --> 00:44:01.110
to concentrate exclusively on finding their next meal. And

644
00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.790
that longer time horizon enables them to plan for

645
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.330
bigger things like investing in their own skills uh

646
00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.489
or just taking on bigger projects than is possible

647
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.419
if you're practically on the edge of starvation all

648
00:44:16.429 --> 00:44:17.239
the time.

649
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.629
Uh So, uh let me ask you about Marx

650
00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:27.360
specifically because of course, he's a huge figure in

651
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:32.479
the 19th century and in economics more largely so,

652
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.679
uh how did these ideas about an, an alienated

653
00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:40.959
work tied to his progressive work ethic?

654
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.729
Yeah. So this is one of my mo my

655
00:44:43.739 --> 00:44:48.639
favorite discoveries in reading the text. Uh Marx, of

656
00:44:48.649 --> 00:44:55.290
course, was uh educated at a Christian Academy in

657
00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.290
Germany uh uh as a minor. Uh AND in

658
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:06.320
his abature, this is his uh graduation final examination.

659
00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.040
Uh He was assigned to write on the topic

660
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:14.669
of a young man's choice of vocation. That is

661
00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:17.209
how does a young man decide what his calling

662
00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:23.399
will be. And in his examination essay, he exactly

663
00:45:23.409 --> 00:45:30.139
reproduces uh Robert Sanderson's criteria for finding one's calling.

664
00:45:30.709 --> 00:45:34.800
Sanderson was 1/17 century puritan preacher and he uh

665
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:39.620
wrote a very famous sermon that was reprinted many,

666
00:45:39.629 --> 00:45:43.300
many times in including deep into the 19th century

667
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.090
in which he laid out his criteria, right? And,

668
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:52.219
and they were, you have to choose something that

669
00:45:52.229 --> 00:45:57.489
will positively benefit uh other people, not just yourself

670
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.899
uh that you will personally find fulfilling because it

671
00:46:02.909 --> 00:46:12.429
exercises skills that you enjoy practicing. Uh AND um

672
00:46:14.159 --> 00:46:19.050
that, you know, conforms, you're able to deploy those

673
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.739
skills effectively, right? So you had education in those

674
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:28.639
skills and essentially in his final exam marks reproduces

675
00:46:28.939 --> 00:46:34.040
all of those criteria. Uh It adds that there's

676
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.629
also an expectation of recognition from the recipients of

677
00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:42.320
your services. They'll appreciate what you did, right? That

678
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.929
you're showing how you care about their welfare and

679
00:46:45.939 --> 00:46:49.989
doing a conscientious job for them and they reciprocate

680
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.649
by honoring what you're doing for them. And that

681
00:46:55.659 --> 00:47:03.530
idea became Marx's idea of un alienated labor. I

682
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.830
mean, step by step. So you can see in

683
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.820
a beautiful way how the puritan notion of the

684
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:14.729
calling leads directly to Marx's ideal of un alienated

685
00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:17.770
labor. Really, the puritans had already figured it out.

686
00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:22.239
Uh And then of course, his critique of capitalism

687
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.699
in the 1844 manuscripts is essentially, well, we're not,

688
00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:30.020
workers aren't getting anything like those conditions, right? They're

689
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:34.139
consigned to drudgery, boring repetitive tasks that are, you

690
00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:39.300
know, mechanized, they're reduced to drudges, nobody appreciates what

691
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:42.889
they're doing. They're bored out of their minds. Their

692
00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:46.870
work is deskilled. Uh And I, I hasten to

693
00:47:46.879 --> 00:47:51.149
add that on these points. Marx and Smith were

694
00:47:51.159 --> 00:47:55.800
in agreement. Both of them agreed that industrial labor

695
00:47:55.810 --> 00:48:00.459
in the factories was horrible for the worker. That

696
00:48:00.469 --> 00:48:04.689
is their daily experience of work was absolutely awful.

697
00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:09.699
Uh And both lamented this fact as did Jon

698
00:48:09.709 --> 00:48:14.209
Stewart Mill. So they're all the progressives are united

699
00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:18.280
on their values about what, what, what a good

700
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:22.610
job would look like. They all agree and they're

701
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:28.290
all taking their cues historically. I mean, they're all

702
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.889
descended from the Puritan tradition of what a good

703
00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:33.929
calling would be like,

704
00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:38.250
and by the way, I guess that it's safe

705
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:43.209
to say that even today, uh, this sort of

706
00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:48.149
an alienated work, it is still true. At least

707
00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:52.050
to a great extent for people who work what

708
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.030
we could call essential jobs. There is the jobs

709
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.860
that keep society and the ideas that people tend

710
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:04.280
to have about, uh, those workers, the kind of

711
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:08.189
work they do and the low status they have

712
00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:12.040
in society are still more or less the same.

713
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.580
Right? And, and I'm, I mean, I'm commenting, I'm

714
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.610
commenting that just because, uh sometimes times we hear

715
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.590
people saying that, oh, the, the bad days of

716
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.149
exploitative work in capitalism for people who worked in

717
00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:32.479
very bad e extremely bad conditions in factories and

718
00:49:32.489 --> 00:49:36.969
elsewhere. Uh They're, they're gone. They, they, they, they

719
00:49:36.979 --> 00:49:40.949
occurred in the 19th century. They're not here anymore.

720
00:49:40.959 --> 00:49:44.030
But I, I mean, I guess that's not exactly

721
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.030
true. Right.

722
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.389
It's not true. Although it is the case that

723
00:49:48.399 --> 00:49:55.560
automation has massively reduced the uh percentage of workers

724
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.260
in the rich countries for being on assembly lines.

725
00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:03.449
However, if you look at the global economy, sweatshop

726
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:07.610
manufacturing is all over the world and those conditions

727
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:13.530
are, you know, not distinguishable from those in the

728
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.530
19th century, uh they're using higher tech, but it's

729
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:24.090
equally drudgery. It's dangerous, it's dirty, it's unhealthy. Right.

730
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.270
It's awful growing and it pays horribly and it's

731
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.270
not, you know, it's very unsafe all the things

732
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.959
that Marx complained about, not just in the 1844

733
00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:35.149
manuscripts but throughout Capitol.

734
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:41.060
So in more recent times, in the 20th century,

735
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:46.729
specifically with the rise of social democracy in what

736
00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:51.110
ways did it encapsulate a progressive work ethic?

737
00:50:52.629 --> 00:50:56.489
Yes. So I read social democracy as it was

738
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:02.409
originally uh imagined uh by Edward Bernstein, who was

739
00:51:02.419 --> 00:51:07.780
uh intellectual leader in Germany's Social Democratic Party as

740
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:13.060
a kind of combination of the progressive work ethic

741
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.580
because it puts them all together in a package,

742
00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:21.379
stressing the importance of decom modifying labor, that is

743
00:51:21.389 --> 00:51:25.300
not just reducing workers to whatever they can get

744
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:31.899
in competitive markets controlled by capitalists. Uh ENABLING people

745
00:51:31.909 --> 00:51:37.489
to uh you know, get decent wages, safe working

746
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.000
conditions, you, you regulate the factories, uh but also

747
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:48.560
a rich body of benefits that don't depend on

748
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:58.360
working. So social welfare benefits, paid vacations, um access

749
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.699
to education that you don't have to pay for

750
00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:04.919
out of pocket um medical care, other kinds of

751
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:09.570
social insurance. Um All of these ideas are I

752
00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.409
think are coming out of the progressive work ethic

753
00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:15.639
and going back actually to the puritan idea that

754
00:52:15.649 --> 00:52:18.629
the economy and the division of labor exists to

755
00:52:18.639 --> 00:52:24.169
advance everyone's welfare. And it doesn't exist in order

756
00:52:24.179 --> 00:52:31.919
to manifest externally some presumed hierarchy of virtue among

757
00:52:31.929 --> 00:52:37.729
workers. And it also is based the, the social

758
00:52:37.739 --> 00:52:42.620
democracy is a very freedom oriented uh system. It

759
00:52:42.629 --> 00:52:45.189
wants to give people lots of free time so

760
00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:49.439
that they could choose to use on their own

761
00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:53.479
judgment rather than working from dawn to dusk at

762
00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:55.639
somebody o somebody else's direction,

763
00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.959
right? And in what ways does that tie to

764
00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:06.770
historically speaking, the origins of social insurance? And what

765
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.300
role does that play in the sort of history

766
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.320
that you are exploring in the book?

767
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:17.550
Yeah. So social insurance is really interesting because uh

768
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.120
it was the idea of social insurance uh was

769
00:53:21.129 --> 00:53:26.239
invented by uh Kor and during the French revolution

770
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:31.870
and Tom Payne, the great American revolutionary who also

771
00:53:31.879 --> 00:53:35.840
played a minor role in the French revolution. Uh

772
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:39.399
Payne and Conor say actually knew each other. Uh

773
00:53:39.409 --> 00:53:47.820
AND Payne traveled to uh uh Paris um during

774
00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:54.229
the revolution and uh escaped with his head. I'm

775
00:53:54.239 --> 00:53:57.010
like kind of said he was executed by the

776
00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.979
Jacobins. Uh But these ideas were in the air

777
00:54:00.989 --> 00:54:05.360
and the great contribution that um Tom Payne made

778
00:54:05.419 --> 00:54:10.290
was to show demonstrate its feasibility. That is what

779
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:16.669
he was postulating was based on uh British data

780
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:23.860
treasury receipts. Basically that if you just tax inheritances,

781
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:29.860
uh you could pay a perfectly fine social insurance

782
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.060
package that would include uh retirement benefits for people,

783
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:41.989
too old to work. Uh DISABILITY benefits, uh survivors

784
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.149
benefits for orphans and widows that it wouldn't take

785
00:54:46.159 --> 00:54:50.300
much of a tax on inheritances to give every

786
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:56.610
poor person uh you know, adequate insurance against destitution.

787
00:54:56.669 --> 00:55:00.790
And that could then replace the poor laws. It

788
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.070
would be a universal benefit for everyone. So you

789
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:09.330
wouldn't have to means test uh uh benefits. Uh

790
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.500
AND you would um get them on a non

791
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:17.939
stigmatized basis because everyone would get them. It wasn't

792
00:55:17.949 --> 00:55:20.850
a sign of shame or stigma if you received

793
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.929
it since everyone was entitled to this. And he

794
00:55:23.939 --> 00:55:27.320
argued on strictly lacking grounds that the landlords owed

795
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.659
a rent to everyone else because once they enclosed

796
00:55:30.669 --> 00:55:35.199
the land, they deprived other people of access to

797
00:55:35.209 --> 00:55:38.449
it, even though the lackey deception of course, is

798
00:55:38.459 --> 00:55:40.729
that the earth started off owned in common by

799
00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:44.870
everyone, right? And so the landlords owed to the

800
00:55:44.879 --> 00:55:48.629
rest of society, the value of production that could

801
00:55:48.639 --> 00:55:53.879
be credited to unimproved land. Uh And that's with

802
00:55:53.889 --> 00:55:56.879
the tax with yields. Uh AND he proved it

803
00:55:56.889 --> 00:56:02.010
was perfectly feasible to abolish poverty uh by implementing

804
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.010
this social insurance system. And also he thought the

805
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.580
inheritance tax would be enough to give every young

806
00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:11.439
person starting out in life a basic grant, a

807
00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:14.600
capital grant, just a lump sum of money which

808
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.580
they could use to purchase tools or an education

809
00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:21.550
or whatever they need, start off in life at,

810
00:56:21.959 --> 00:56:25.919
at a higher wage, right? So that they wouldn't

811
00:56:25.929 --> 00:56:28.129
fall into poverty in the first place,

812
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:34.330
right? And so finally getting into the subtitle of

813
00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:41.010
your book, what is neoliberalism? What characterizes it exactly?

814
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:47.010
And how was it influenced by the conservative work

815
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.370
ethic?

816
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:55.080
So my argument is that neoliberalism, I'm just defining

817
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:59.510
this as a set of policies. First off, just

818
00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.649
a set of policies that systematically favor capitalists over

819
00:57:04.659 --> 00:57:08.620
workers. And there's a lot of them, uh, that

820
00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:15.780
includes, um, low marginal tax rates on supersized income,

821
00:57:16.969 --> 00:57:22.469
favorable tax treatment of capital income. Uh, THE insistence

822
00:57:22.479 --> 00:57:27.030
that, uh, employers have a monopoly over the direction

823
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.780
of their companies with workers not having any voice.

824
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.739
Uh, A set of global free trade agreements that

825
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:41.780
forbid states from regulating businesses in ways that might

826
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.379
reduce their profits. Right? There's a whole set of

827
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:49.919
policies like this that all skew in favor of

828
00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:54.419
capital. Oh, and extreme hostility to labor unions, right?

829
00:57:54.429 --> 00:57:56.760
Workers should get a voice. They should just rely

830
00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:00.510
on what the market gives them and hostility, of

831
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.479
course, to welfare payments or any access to income

832
00:58:05.149 --> 00:58:11.679
other than work for ordinary people. Um So you

833
00:58:11.689 --> 00:58:16.120
put that all together, right? And that's neoliberalism today.

834
00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:21.340
And the critical issue is neoliberalism is packaged to

835
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.129
uh contemporary people on the theory that, well, it's

836
00:58:24.139 --> 00:58:26.129
about free markets and all the freedom you can

837
00:58:26.139 --> 00:58:28.770
have on the market as a consumer or as

838
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.760
a worker or as a business owner. But in

839
00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:37.169
reality, it's really a theory of shrinking the size

840
00:58:37.179 --> 00:58:41.270
of the state and state capacity because neoliberalism also

841
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.439
thinks all those lazy bureaucrats, they can't do anything

842
00:58:44.449 --> 00:58:48.209
efficiently. So government services should be outsourced to private,

843
00:58:48.219 --> 00:58:51.790
for profit corporations here in the United States that's

844
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.449
been carried to a significant extent. We have private

845
00:58:55.459 --> 00:59:00.429
for profit prisons, just as Bentham advocated, we have

846
00:59:00.439 --> 00:59:06.709
uh private for profit schools even in elementary grades.

847
00:59:06.719 --> 00:59:10.090
Uh RIGHT, they might be tax funded, but it's

848
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.830
really a private entrepreneur who is organizing the school

849
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.750
and running it for profit. Um So that's neoliberalism.

850
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.489
And my argument is that neoliberalism just is the

851
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.489
latest version of the conservative work ethic. It's like

852
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:31.189
let the capitalists roll and design property and markets

853
00:59:31.199 --> 00:59:36.929
and other institutions in their favor, uh hostility to

854
00:59:36.939 --> 00:59:41.280
state capacity or any state benefits. Um BECAUSE the

855
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:47.159
workers should be in a state of precarity and

856
00:59:47.419 --> 00:59:51.340
right under the ideology of personal responsibility and not

857
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:56.939
being dependent. Right. Uh That's going back to priestly.

858
00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:01.340
It's all the same. And what I'm doing then

859
01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:05.320
is showing that our contemporary neoliberalism, it's just a

860
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.570
rewarmed fru of the conservative work ethic. And we

861
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:15.290
should recognize that fact. It's about capitalist ruling.

862
01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:20.629
Yeah. And I guess that people need to stop

863
01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:24.590
complaining because if they are not rich yet, it's

864
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.949
just because they're not working hard enough.

865
01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.909
Right. Right. I mean, that's the theory.

866
01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:39.949
Yeah. And so how does welfare policy operate within

867
01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:42.030
neo liberal capitalism?

868
01:00:42.929 --> 01:00:45.889
Yeah. And this is like the great contrast between

869
01:00:45.899 --> 01:00:50.870
the social democracies and the model of welfare policy

870
01:00:50.879 --> 01:00:54.620
that we see exemplified most strongly in the United

871
01:00:54.629 --> 01:00:58.540
States, but to a certain degree in Britain as

872
01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:02.639
well, at least under Tory governments. And the, the,

873
01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:06.219
the basic idea is you, you have a general

874
01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:10.639
hostility towards universal benefits. So, in the United States,

875
01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:14.399
the Democratic Party has been trying since around 1948

876
01:01:14.949 --> 01:01:18.689
to get universal health care and inch by inch.

877
01:01:18.699 --> 01:01:21.340
It's been a massive struggle. We still don't quite

878
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:26.379
have it. Obamacare made a major step towards universal

879
01:01:26.389 --> 01:01:28.300
health care. But in fact, there are still many

880
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:33.830
millions of Americans who have inadequate or unaffordable health

881
01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.659
insurance or none at all. Right, because they just

882
01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:41.399
can't afford it. Um And that's right that you

883
01:01:41.409 --> 01:01:43.489
could see that coming out of the hostility to

884
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.570
welfare programs that we see in pre priestly and

885
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:53.540
Malthus. Um uh AND, and so I see the

886
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.530
United States as really the conservative work ethic on

887
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:03.389
steroids under neoliberalism, things have to be means tested.

888
01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:07.679
There's very, it's very stingy, welfare benefits, very mean

889
01:02:07.689 --> 01:02:11.800
spirited, lots of arbitrary obstacles in front of getting

890
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.639
them a deep impatience with people who are on

891
01:02:14.649 --> 01:02:19.209
benefits for too long, arbitrary cut off dates. That

892
01:02:19.219 --> 01:02:23.870
was the welfare reform that Clinton enacted in 1996.

893
01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:27.510
It's all the same.

894
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.310
Mhm. Uh And particularly when it comes to business

895
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:39.699
ethics in neoliberalism. How does a conservative work ethic

896
01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:43.719
translate into it? Exactly. And particularly with this sort

897
01:02:43.729 --> 01:02:47.739
of shareholder version of capitalism.

898
01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:53.570
Yeah. So, um in the immediate post war era,

899
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:57.169
the United States had a brief era of stakeholder

900
01:02:57.179 --> 01:03:02.770
capitalism and that meant that corporations and uh the,

901
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.879
the heads of corporations thought that it was their

902
01:03:05.889 --> 01:03:08.969
duty to serve all of the stakeholders in the

903
01:03:08.979 --> 01:03:12.879
firm, you had high rates of unionization. And so

904
01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:15.610
even nonunion jobs had to keep up with those

905
01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:20.030
wages that were set in the unionized uh, factories.

906
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:25.090
Uh, AND CEO S would take pride in the

907
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.199
fact that they had so many well paid workers,

908
01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:31.879
but there were other CEO S who opposed that

909
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.500
and had a more conservative view of things and

910
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:37.750
thought that, well, you know, a business is not

911
01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.840
a charity, businesses should be run strictly for the

912
01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:44.879
owners that is the shareholders. And our sole duty

913
01:03:44.889 --> 01:03:47.899
is to maximize profits. That's what the economist Milton

914
01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:51.820
Friedman said. Uh And that theory took off uh

915
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:55.550
with the rise of neo liberal ideology starting in

916
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.340
the 19 seventies, it really took off with the

917
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:02.570
election of Ronald Reagan who pressed the liberal policy.

918
01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:06.290
Uh And of course, labor unions had been in

919
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.020
decline again since around 1948 actually. Uh uh THE

920
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:14.790
post war era, a major anti union bill was

921
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:20.729
passed, uh called the Taft Hartley bill, uh which

922
01:04:20.739 --> 01:04:24.229
Truman vetoed, but he was overwritten. Truman called it

923
01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:27.639
a slave labor bill. He thought it would destroy

924
01:04:27.649 --> 01:04:30.350
labor unions and it took some decades. But in

925
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.159
fact, labor union rates now in the private sector

926
01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:37.800
are around 6% down from around a third of

927
01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:41.790
workers uh in the private sector. Uh AT their

928
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.590
peak, there's a big difference in bargaining power if

929
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.719
you don't have a labor union. And, and if

930
01:04:47.729 --> 01:04:51.949
you don't have high labor density, labor union density.

931
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.139
So workers have been falling back and capitalists have

932
01:04:56.149 --> 01:05:01.600
been massively enlarging their profits. Now, what the puritans,

933
01:05:01.729 --> 01:05:07.550
you know said is that it's fine to make

934
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.620
money, but you're not allowed to make money in

935
01:05:10.629 --> 01:05:15.070
predatory and exploitative ways. And they listed some of

936
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.949
those ways. One of them is their very stern

937
01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:22.010
anti monopolists and they didn't care whether the monopoly

938
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.500
was established by the state, a state grant, a

939
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:30.020
monopoly or whether it was achieved through various kinds

940
01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:34.409
of private sector, business tactics. It was wrong. You're

941
01:05:34.419 --> 01:05:37.479
not allowed to exploit other people by charging monopoly

942
01:05:37.489 --> 01:05:42.300
prices or monopoly prices on labor. That is if

943
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:45.350
you're the only employer say in a factory town,

944
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.840
you can drive wages down because those workers have

945
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:53.159
no other choice. They didn't like either and they

946
01:05:53.169 --> 01:05:58.100
didn't like uh you know, exploiting renters. That was

947
01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.860
also bad just hiking the rents because you could

948
01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:05.889
uh and they also oppose making huge profits based

949
01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:12.360
on zero sum financial speculation. In all the neo

950
01:06:12.399 --> 01:06:17.209
liberal economies, we see a financialization happening where banks

951
01:06:17.219 --> 01:06:19.739
are uh taking a larger and larger share of

952
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:24.850
profits as they are uh as they, it's, they

953
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:28.070
are playing more and more purely speculative zero sum

954
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.709
games. We saw what happened with the height of

955
01:06:31.719 --> 01:06:36.399
speculation in 2007 and eight. It basically drove the

956
01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:41.290
world economy into recession for years. Um The ps

957
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:45.629
didn't understand macroeconomics but they did understand that if

958
01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:47.629
you just are playing a lot of zero sum

959
01:06:47.639 --> 01:06:51.489
games, you're just profiting at other people's expense, you're

960
01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.360
not adding value, you're not promoting human welfare. So

961
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.320
they were very sternly opposed to making mon money

962
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:01.459
that way. But that's actually the chief source of

963
01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:06.250
profits. If you add up monopoly profits and profits

964
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.330
from speculation, that's basically most of the profits that

965
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:15.919
corporations are making now in the global economy. So

966
01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:19.330
their business models would be condemned by the puritans

967
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.459
and they're also condemned by social democracy.

968
01:07:23.969 --> 01:07:27.790
So this sort of neo liberal version of the

969
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.879
conservative work ethic is the work ethic that is

970
01:07:32.889 --> 01:07:36.030
dominant in the world uh today.

971
01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:41.000
Right? I think that's correct. Yes. Um It, it's

972
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:46.429
because the global rules of uh trade have been

973
01:07:46.439 --> 01:07:51.300
written in a neo liberal uh uh with a

974
01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:55.770
neo liberal orientation. So they prevent countries who have

975
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.959
signed on to the World Trade Organization from taking

976
01:07:59.969 --> 01:08:04.290
measures that would reduce the profits of foreign investors

977
01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:09.189
uh because of, you know, taxation or regulation or

978
01:08:09.199 --> 01:08:13.030
minimum wages or any of the other techniques that

979
01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.640
social democracies use to improve the lot of ordinary

980
01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:17.350
workers.

981
01:08:19.009 --> 01:08:23.729
So my final question will be then, uh what

982
01:08:23.919 --> 01:08:28.990
can and should we do about it then? WW

983
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.470
how can we deal? Uh I mean, how can

984
01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.930
we go or try to go beyond the current

985
01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:41.350
state of affairs with neoliberalism, this newer version of

986
01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:45.910
the conservative work ethic and perhaps strive for uh

987
01:08:45.919 --> 01:08:50.189
to uh I mean, try to get into a

988
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.790
more progressive version of it.

989
01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.600
Well, so I, I am working from the premise

990
01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:04.349
that some idea about the work ethic still has

991
01:09:04.358 --> 01:09:07.448
a deep hold certainly in the United States and

992
01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:16.040
the other uh countries uh that were uh orig

993
01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:19.529
originally settled by the English. So that would include

994
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.560
Australia, New Zealand and so forth. Um THAT work

995
01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:28.379
ethic values still exists. It's, it's in the discourse.

996
01:09:29.038 --> 01:09:32.988
And so one of the big contributions of my

997
01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:37.457
book is I wanna say, look, there really is

998
01:09:37.469 --> 01:09:40.450
a positive side to the work ethic and it

999
01:09:40.459 --> 01:09:44.180
makes a certain amount of sense. These are genuine

1000
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:47.100
virtues. They're not the only virtues, of course. And

1001
01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:50.479
one of the chief uh benefits of social democracy

1002
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:54.379
is that it gives us room to develop other

1003
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:58.740
values, other virtues besides the work ethic virtues. But

1004
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:01.410
it's still the case that social democracy does depend

1005
01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:08.410
on uh people working. There's nothing wrong with expecting

1006
01:10:08.419 --> 01:10:13.859
reciprocity from one another. Um As the parents insisted,

1007
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:16.290
that meant that even the rich should be working.

1008
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:20.490
And that means positively promoting human welfare and not

1009
01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.029
just collecting income passively or engaging in predatory business

1010
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.330
methods, but really positively helping other people through disciplined

1011
01:10:30.339 --> 01:10:33.279
work. Um Anyone who's able to do that, I

1012
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:37.589
think should be expected to do their share. And

1013
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.100
the social democracies depend on that because if people

1014
01:10:41.109 --> 01:10:45.000
aren't working, you can't raise taxes needed to find

1015
01:10:45.009 --> 01:10:48.810
a generous welfare state. So you see uh actually

1016
01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:51.209
a stress in these, in these countries on high

1017
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:57.220
labor force participation uh and mechanisms such as uh

1018
01:10:57.689 --> 01:11:02.939
state paid um preschools to make that possible for

1019
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:06.209
women to participate at high rates as well. Um

1020
01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.569
So what I want to argue is, look, we,

1021
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.520
we can't really escape the work ethic. I think

1022
01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:16.629
uh it's deeply embedded in these cultures. Uh BUT

1023
01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.790
we can turn it around and use it in

1024
01:11:18.799 --> 01:11:22.419
favor of workers uh rather than use it against

1025
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:25.759
them. And so the chief contribution of my book

1026
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.910
is to unearth the what I call the progressive

1027
01:11:28.919 --> 01:11:32.040
work ethic and shows that it animated a large

1028
01:11:32.049 --> 01:11:36.490
number of thinkers from the 19th century through the

1029
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.689
glory days of social democracy. I think today that

1030
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.479
social democracy still remains the most successful model we've

1031
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:48.399
ever had of a more equal and fair society,

1032
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.129
although it's fallen on hard times. And I think

1033
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.479
what we need to do is re envision social

1034
01:11:54.490 --> 01:12:00.660
democracy and reinvigorate it by uh re revising social

1035
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:05.180
democratic policies for the 21st century. But again, that,

1036
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:09.479
that does involve acknowledging, you know, some of the

1037
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:12.490
values of the work ethic. Of course, we've abandoned

1038
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.569
for a long time, including the conservatives have abandoned

1039
01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.490
the killjoy aspects that the parents had like no

1040
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.439
pleasure in this world, right? We've abandoned some of

1041
01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:25.560
the original values and rightly so, but others I

1042
01:12:25.569 --> 01:12:28.279
think are worth, are worth building on in a

1043
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:30.689
way that would actually be helpful to workers.

1044
01:12:32.259 --> 01:12:37.009
Great. So the book is again hijacked how neoliberalism

1045
01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:40.459
termed the work ethic against workers and how workers

1046
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:43.029
can take it back. I'm leaving a link to

1047
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.509
it in the description box of the interview. And

1048
01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.790

1049
01:12:48.799 --> 01:12:50.979
