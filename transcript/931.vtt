00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.550
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.909
I'm joined by Doctor Michael Hudson. He is president

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.350
of the Institute for the study of long term

5
00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.140
economic trends and distinguished research professor of Economics at

6
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.729
the University of Missouri Kansas City. And today we're

7
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.129
focusing mostly on his book, The Collapse of Antiquity.

8
00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:25.100
But we're also talking about a little bit about

9
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.040
and forgive them their debts. And also I would

10
00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:30.739
also like to mention that Dr Hudson as a

11
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.040
new book, uh Temples of Enterprise. So Doctor Hudson,

12
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.259
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.450
Well, it's good to be here. Thank you for

14
00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:41.159
inviting me.

15
00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:45.970
So before we get into the collapse sovereignty with

16
00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:49.209
the, since it is a sequel to your book

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.330
and forgive them their debts, I would like to

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.819
start by asking you a little bit about it

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.610
and particularly about the history of debt and its

20
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.599
cancellation, which is something that you cover a lot

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.809
in your first book of these trilogy. So how

22
00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.839
old are the notions of debtors and creditors and

23
00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:12.449
the relations between them?

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.440
Well, all early societies operated on credit long before

25
00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:20.760
there was money, for instance, uh, their, their guilt.

26
00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:24.220
Uh, IF you injured somebody, then you had to

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.180
pay them compensation. Uh, IF they hadn't, uh, arranged

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.410
that kind of, uh, uh, compensation, then there would

29
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.815
have and feud justice people would think. Well, you

30
00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:38.235
injured a member of my family. I'm gonna injure,

31
00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.665
uh, a member of yours. So people had to

32
00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:44.235
pay Vergel. That meant man price, uh, for any

33
00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.644
injury. Uh But because they didn't have money, it

34
00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:51.875
was usually in the form of a uh set

35
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:57.129
uh a basket of commodities uh that they, they

36
00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.379
would have uh there was broad price if uh

37
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.309
you would have a daughter getting married, uh you

38
00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.400
had to provide a dowry for her. Uh But

39
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.038
even more important than that for all of the

40
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.020
indigenous societies, communities uh investigated by anthropologists, everybody was

41
00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.134
in debt to everybody else through gift exchange. For

42
00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:24.154
instance, even though uh the uh everybody was growing

43
00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:28.115
crops uh for themselves, they would uh give crops

44
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:31.134
to a neighbor and a friends and that would

45
00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:35.095
cause a reciprocal obligation to give their crops back.

46
00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.625
And the whole idea of credit originally was to

47
00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:43.554
integrate societies not drive them apart uh as today.

48
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.250
Well, gradually they uh co uh these societies developed

49
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.600
and the debts were bound uh to uh develop

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.119
more as you had a specialization of labor. And

51
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.559
that occurred primarily in Mesopotamia uh with, because that

52
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.460
had the large institutions, the uh temples and the

53
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.610
palaces. Uh And when you have large institutions, you

54
00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.649
have to have resource allocation that meant you had

55
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.860
to have some standard of value to measure. And

56
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.550
the standard of value was uh for the domestic

57
00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:27.479
agricultural sector, grains. Uh MANY of the rulers when

58
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.250
they would come in would announce a uh a

59
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.100
price schedule. Uh ONE unit of brain would be

60
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.960
equal to one shuttle of silver. So that there

61
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.179
would be a communication, sometimes they would add copper,

62
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.899
sometimes they would add wool, uh all sorts of

63
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.259
other things. So that there was generally a means

64
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.800
of transactions between the communal communal sector, the families

65
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.419
on the land and the the palaces and the

66
00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:01.429
temples that had dependent labor, for instance, war widows

67
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.139
and orphans were uh working in, in the temples,

68
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.899
weaving textiles uh and other things. Uh But e

69
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.979
even before that you had the kind of depths

70
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.800
that were attached to the land and sometime in

71
00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.339
the stone age land began to be assigned to

72
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.989
people. You couldn't just uh grab whoever uh settles

73
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.100
here first gets to keep the land. It was

74
00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:31.420
all pretty homogeneous and land was assigned to citizens

75
00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:36.459
on a fairly standardized uh unit in exchange for

76
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.089
the citizens liability to all the community. Two things,

77
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.279
the uh the uh the citizens had to fight

78
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.339
in the army after the, the men and they

79
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.380
had to work on the Corvey labor that is

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.410
for infrastructure projects. Uh And when the, they were

81
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.980
not working on the land to do harvesting, they

82
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:04.040
would be uh working on building irrigation ditches, building

83
00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:08.209
the cigarette temple, pyramids, building the walls. Uh And

84
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.320
so the uh the land was allocated to families

85
00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:17.079
so that they could feed themselves and have enough

86
00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.850
uh crop left over to uh for, to give

87
00:05:21.859 --> 00:05:24.239
it to the palace. Uh OR for the temples

88
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.549
for various services. You would have to pay the

89
00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.489
temple priest for marriages, for uh for, for burials.

90
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.329
Uh And you had the division of labor, all

91
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.170
all settled by uh credit and the economy basically

92
00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:42.019
still worked on it on a credit uh economy

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.459
uh with these mutual uh obligations and uh problematic

94
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.257
personal debts didn't really develop uh during until maybe

95
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.358
the third millennium. BC is where we begin to

96
00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:59.088
have the first royal clean slates. Uh So suppose

97
00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:03.507
that uh uh the economy worked on credit during

98
00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:06.528
the crop year because there wasn't any grain to

99
00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.708
pay because it wasn't harvested yet. And so if

100
00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.888
uh uh people would go to the local bar

101
00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:16.868
to the ale house, uh They would uh have

102
00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.216
uh ale and they uh the proprietor uh woman

103
00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:22.735
would mark it up on, on the slate just

104
00:06:22.746 --> 00:06:24.855
like you go into a bar and you pay

105
00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:27.776
on payday. Uh But the payday in the bronze

106
00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:31.566
age was when the crop was in. And at

107
00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:35.295
that point, the uh the cultivators would then uh

108
00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:39.075
uh have bring their crop to uh the temples.

109
00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:41.795
It would all be measured out on the threshing

110
00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:45.476
floor and the uh they uh they would measure

111
00:06:45.485 --> 00:06:47.085
out how much do you owe to the Ale

112
00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:48.876
Woman? How much do you owe to the temple?

113
00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:51.503
How much do you get to keep uh for

114
00:06:51.514 --> 00:06:54.973
yourself? All of that. Uh The uh all of

115
00:06:54.984 --> 00:06:57.683
that was a kind of uh working in kind

116
00:06:57.694 --> 00:07:01.023
And money was only used really at harvest time

117
00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:03.824
because that was the only time it appeared. Well,

118
00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:06.174
all the way down to the medieval period, by

119
00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:09.144
the 12th and 13th century in England, for instance,

120
00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:12.364
uh that operated the same way. Uh THE uh

121
00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:16.834
serfs or uh uh cultivators uh would operate on

122
00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:20.022
credit during the crop year, money would finally come

123
00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:22.351
in uh when they would grow the crop, uh

124
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.721
They would, they would sell it, they would use

125
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.631
the money to pay uh whoever they owed money

126
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:30.752
to. And uh essentially that would clear the slate

127
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:34.772
for again. But what happened if the crops failed?

128
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.861
Uh There could be a drought, there could be

129
00:07:38.872 --> 00:07:42.951
a flood or there could be military uh operations.

130
00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.971
And so when that happened, uh the uh uh

131
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:52.029
palace said, well, uh we can't have uh the

132
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.029
uh the cultivators unable to pay the debts because

133
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.230
if you couldn't pay the debt to someone, you

134
00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:01.230
owed it to, you had to work it off

135
00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.640
in labor and in fact, one of the few,

136
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.880
the, the first way of getting labor for hire

137
00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.570
was uh to lend money to someone and say,

138
00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.450
well, you can work it off. We want your

139
00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:17.380
labor powers. Uh And uh if the uh ruler,

140
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.640
uh the king did not say, all right, there

141
00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.000
is a, a flood, a drought you don't have

142
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.619
to pay. Uh IN, in Hammurabi's laws. It says

143
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.890
uh if the storm God aed floods, the land,

144
00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:33.270
the debt don't get paid because otherwise you'd have

145
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.950
everybody all of a sudden, you'd have the cultivators

146
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.940
falling into bondage to uh their creditors. And some

147
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.070
people in any case had to borrow money even

148
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.830
beyond what they could pay, even in normal. Uh

149
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.650
uh TIMES they could get sick. Uh uh THEY

150
00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:52.989
could need a special help. There could be all

151
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.729
sorts of problems and you had uh to work

152
00:08:57.739 --> 00:09:01.349
off uh the debt, uh often in the form

153
00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:04.340
of bondage. Uh You wouldn't necessarily have to live

154
00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:07.659
at the predator's house. Uh But the uh often

155
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.919
the borrower, the head of the uh man at

156
00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:13.059
the head of the family would say, well, take

157
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.619
my slave girl, for instance, I'll pledge my slave

158
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.679
girl uh to you uh as collateral to get

159
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.419
back or e even uh their wife or their

160
00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:27.349
daughter. Uh And so, uh uh the economy got,

161
00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:30.400
tended to get out of balance in time and

162
00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:35.109
rumors would come in and uh around 2500 BC

163
00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:37.909
just uh start. Ok. Uh We're going to start

164
00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:40.830
a clean slate. Uh We're, we're going to wipe

165
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.820
out the problematic uh debt so that everybody can

166
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.270
basically uh be in balance and we can keep

167
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.270
restoring a kind of idealized status quo, ante uh

168
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.700
the, the way the world uh was before it

169
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.989
got out of kilter. And uh that, that was

170
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.789
the who the whole idea, there was a kind

171
00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.940
of idea of a norm. And fortunately, there was

172
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.169
no Milton Friedman or uh Chicago school people to

173
00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.359
say, well, everything's going to work out automatically. Uh

174
00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:12.960
They uh the bronze age rulers were much smarter

175
00:10:12.969 --> 00:10:16.679
than uh the modern economists. They knew that economies

176
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.880
tended to polarize and the main cause of polarization

177
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.960
was debt and the way to get rid of

178
00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:24.830
it was simply to cancel the deaths and uh

179
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.070
uh put everybody on an equal footing once again.

180
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.489
But when exactly did rulers decide that perhaps it

181
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.599
was a good time for a depth consolation.

182
00:10:37.609 --> 00:10:40.849
Oh, there were two occasions when any new ruler

183
00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:44.049
took the throne. Uh He said, well, I'm gonna

184
00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:46.340
start my throne uh with, I'm gonna be a

185
00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:48.979
good ruler. I'm gonna start the throne with everything

186
00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:51.580
in balance. We're gonna cancel the depth and begin

187
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.229
my rule in balance and hopefully we're gonna keep

188
00:10:55.239 --> 00:10:57.700
things that way. So a new ruler would uh

189
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.565
be crowned and uh usually it was told on

190
00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:04.906
his second year uh uh of the year names

191
00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:08.005
for the rulers, they'd say uh he proclaims justice.

192
00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:10.445
Uh And this, there would be at some point

193
00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:13.755
after the coronation. Uh And we don't know exactly

194
00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:16.486
when it could have been harvest time. Uh THAT

195
00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:18.966
uh the ruler would do that or uh it

196
00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:21.435
would be at harvest time or there would be

197
00:11:21.445 --> 00:11:24.385
a military conquest. And for, for instance, when Hammurabi

198
00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:28.406
uh conquered uh some of the neighboring regions, uh

199
00:11:28.552 --> 00:11:31.822
he uh proclaimed a debt cancellation for the region.

200
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:35.171
Uh uh Number one by liberating all of the

201
00:11:35.182 --> 00:11:38.611
debt bond persons. He got the support of all

202
00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:41.952
of the uh the people in these regions. And

203
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:44.502
uh also uh that was sort of like uh

204
00:11:44.512 --> 00:11:48.242
just like uh uh I hammer Ravi uh canceled

205
00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:50.331
all the debts when I took the throne. Uh

206
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:52.252
I'm doing it for you because you're part of

207
00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:55.182
my uh my region. And this is the beginning

208
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:58.530
of my reign over you people in Larsa uh

209
00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:01.119
or uh whoever else uh they, they were there.

210
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.289
But just to clarify this point, what were the

211
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:10.809
kinds of debts that were canceled? Exactly? Were it,

212
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.390
was it only personal debts or also

213
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.700
commercial debts? Uh O only the only personal debts?

214
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.210
Uh uh The uh the other form of debt

215
00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:25.429
of course, was trade debt. And uh that developed

216
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.104
consumer because uh uh Mesopotamia had very rich land

217
00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:34.354
that was deposited over millions of years by sediment

218
00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:38.945
uh by the uh rivers overflowing and uh giving

219
00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:41.575
it very rich land. Uh But it didn't have

220
00:12:41.585 --> 00:12:45.765
stone or metal. And uh so similar, the Sumerians

221
00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:48.864
had to trade for their raw materials. And what

222
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:53.669
they did was they exchange uh the uh palace,

223
00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:57.619
the temples or even uh private uh landowners. Uh

224
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.390
We don't know too much but uh about how

225
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.979
they develop, but they would consign textiles or handicrafts

226
00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:09.109
to, to merchants. And uh they uh said, well,

227
00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:11.900
the idea is we want to share, uh you

228
00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:14.390
know, you uh we're gonna give you the uh

229
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.070
consignment of the textile. Uh WE want have, have

230
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.190
you get half the profits, we get half the

231
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.351
profits. But at that time, uh nobody expected the

232
00:13:23.361 --> 00:13:26.870
merchants to actually keep record books of uh how,

233
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.140
how much they traded and what they got back.

234
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:31.721
So the deal was uh you're going to have

235
00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:35.181
to pay us. Uh uh We give you one,

236
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.270
Mina, you'll have to pay us back in uh

237
00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:40.820
two minas of silver, uh 100%. Uh YOU know,

238
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.611
the, the debt will double in five years. That

239
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.820
was the normal uh uh uh commercial loan. And

240
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.971
uh the, the merchant uh would uh have uh

241
00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:55.442
basically, obviously they made a very large uh trade

242
00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:59.461
because uh five years doubling time works out to

243
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:04.552
uh 20% per year in normal interest. Uh And

244
00:14:04.562 --> 00:14:08.421
uh it's possible that uh merchants would run into

245
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:10.901
debt to each other. They, they were all part

246
00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:14.632
of a community in any local city where they

247
00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:17.012
developed up as you got, went into N A,

248
00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:22.112
uh, or into Iran or, uh, uh, uh, elsewhere,

249
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:25.932
there'd be, uh, local groups and it's possible that,

250
00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:29.593
uh, merchants couldn't pay the debts to other merchants,

251
00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:33.062
but no matter what, they would still always have

252
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:36.692
their own self-support lands, uh, if, uh, worse came

253
00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:39.453
to worse, uh, because the citizens, they all had

254
00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:42.572
the self-support lands. And so, uh, they, they were

255
00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:45.633
protected by the fact that everybody gets as a

256
00:14:45.643 --> 00:14:49.523
human, right? The basic means of self support. Uh

257
00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:52.874
And uh, so the commercial debts were not canceled.

258
00:14:53.023 --> 00:14:56.494
Uh, THAT was uh left. Uh, TH those debts

259
00:14:56.504 --> 00:15:01.193
were denominated in silver. So when the Babylonian rulers,

260
00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:03.864
uh Hamar Rabi's dynasty and other people in the

261
00:15:03.874 --> 00:15:08.473
early second millennium, it was around 1750 BC would

262
00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:12.153
uh uh cancel the debts. They would always specify

263
00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:16.385
that these were the, uh barley debts that were

264
00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:19.645
canceled, not the silver debts that were left in

265
00:15:19.655 --> 00:15:22.755
place. Uh, JUST like, uh, uh, today, uh, uh,

266
00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:25.784
the, the problematic debts that everybody wants to be

267
00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:28.755
canceled are the student loan debts and the uh,

268
00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:33.315
uh, the bankrupt, uh, personal bankruptcy, uh for people

269
00:15:33.325 --> 00:15:35.844
who couldn't pay, but uh, uh, they're not really

270
00:15:35.854 --> 00:15:39.354
canceling uh business debts if there's a bankruptcy, uh,

271
00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:41.275
you lose, you lose the property

272
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:48.679
since you mentioned interest and interest rates there. How

273
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.780
was interest bearing debt invented?

274
00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:55.510
Well, originally, as I said, it was part of

275
00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.169
the profit sharing agreement uh in uh in uh

276
00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:03.890
foreign trade uh for silver debts. Uh THE pro

277
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.909
and it took a long time for me to

278
00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:10.219
figure out how you got the interest. How did

279
00:16:10.229 --> 00:16:14.390
this spread to the agricultural sector? Well, the palace

280
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.039
had agreements with uh the uh the community that

281
00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:22.843
they palace had its own land and the temples

282
00:16:22.853 --> 00:16:25.263
had their own lands and they would lend these

283
00:16:25.273 --> 00:16:30.283
uh uh lend these lands, the sharecroppers in exchange

284
00:16:30.293 --> 00:16:33.533
for one third of the crop. And so somehow

285
00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:36.052
they said, all right. Well, just as, uh, we

286
00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:39.293
get one third of the return for land if

287
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:42.343
we give you money, uh, the interest rate for

288
00:16:42.353 --> 00:16:46.062
barley debts is 30 is one third of the

289
00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:49.793
principal. Uh, SOMETIMES, uh, the predator would charge one

290
00:16:49.802 --> 00:16:52.786
third if, even if it wasn't an entire year.

291
00:16:52.885 --> 00:16:55.786
Uh, uh, WE found, uh in the records that

292
00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:58.505
it was supposed to be one third and, uh,

293
00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:01.745
in Hammurabi's laws, he specifies silver debts have to

294
00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:05.145
pay 20 20% per year, but he didn't say

295
00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:09.556
20% because they didn't use, uh, the, uh, the

296
00:17:09.566 --> 00:17:12.935
decimal system. They used the sex adjustment system that

297
00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:15.675
is based on sixties just as you have 60

298
00:17:15.685 --> 00:17:19.170
seconds in a minute. In a minute. You had

299
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.709
60 shuttles in um, um, a, a silver Mina

300
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.239
and you one shekle, uh, per mina per month

301
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.880
works out to 12 shekel. Uh, A year. That's

302
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.479
the 12/60 that's 20%. Uh Well, that became the

303
00:17:38.489 --> 00:17:42.300
uh the standard. And the, the uh they expressed

304
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.609
this in a kind of poetic meta metaphor. They

305
00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:49.329
said the Mina gives birth to a shekel and

306
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:52.290
it gave birth to it on the new moon.

307
00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:56.380
Uh And every uh new mo every month, there

308
00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.920
would be another uh shekle born to this Mina

309
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.000
of uh debt or proportionally uh whatever there was.

310
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.750
So money was uh the payment of interest, the

311
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.400
thought of uh uh uh reproducing itself just like

312
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.750
an animal. Well, uh by the time that Aristotle

313
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.760
tried to figure out uh uh how money and

314
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.959
interest came into being uh the fact that they

315
00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:28.140
uh the sumerians called uh interest mush, which is

316
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.119
the word for a young goat because they said,

317
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.680
well, for the metaphor, uh just as a uh

318
00:18:33.689 --> 00:18:37.400
uh Mina gives birth to a shuffle. It sort

319
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.689
of like a goat giving birth. That was their

320
00:18:40.699 --> 00:18:44.719
image for giving birth. Uh Because uh obviously silver

321
00:18:44.729 --> 00:18:48.520
doesn't uh reproduce uh as Aristotle noticed. So, uh

322
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.030
you would, you would have the uh uh the

323
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.930
meaning of giving birth birth as mu well, by

324
00:18:55.939 --> 00:19:00.290
the time uh the uh idea of interest was

325
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.310
uh brought uh to the West and the uh

326
00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:07.099
uh eighth century B say the uh interest was

327
00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:11.540
called Cocos, which was uh uh a young uh

328
00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.969
cattle in uh uh in uh Greek or Fus

329
00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:19.699
uh as infertile uh for uh, which is the

330
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:23.250
word for cattle in, uh, in Rome. Uh, AND,

331
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.479
uh, they had the same idea that you had

332
00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:29.579
in Suer of giving birth. Well, but they didn't

333
00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:34.390
use the 60 base system. Uh, uh, uh, Greece,

334
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.150
uh, used the Egyptian decimal system. So the, uh,

335
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.020
rate of interest was decimal, either it was 10%

336
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.260
a year or it was 1% per month. And

337
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.680
in Rome it was 1/12. Rome used the Du

338
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:51.989
Duo deciple system. Uh, BASED on 12th, there were

339
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.410
12 troy ounces in a pound. Uh And so

340
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.520
the pound gave birth to an ounce once a

341
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.670
year. So you had the same metaphor of giving

342
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.689
birth, but they use the word for animal. And,

343
00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:10.020
uh, Aristotle said, oh, this doesn't make any sense

344
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.619
at all because silver is a barren metal. It

345
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.510
doesn't really give birth. He didn't, uh, he didn't

346
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.510
realize how metaphoric, uh the uh idea is. And

347
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.969
of course, when you have economists try to write

348
00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:25.589
ancient history, uh, they're the one, the one group

349
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.449
that should not write, uh about ancient history because

350
00:20:28.459 --> 00:20:31.665
they think how, what, how would we, uh organize

351
00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:34.594
a Sumerian Bron age economy if we went back

352
00:20:34.604 --> 00:20:37.224
in a time machine, they'd think? Oh, well, I

353
00:20:37.234 --> 00:20:40.175
guess, uh, the original form of interest was people

354
00:20:40.185 --> 00:20:43.234
would lend cows. Uh, AND, uh, they, they get

355
00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:46.525
the cows as interest and, uh, uh, anthropologists have

356
00:20:46.535 --> 00:20:50.795
found no uh society anywhere in the world. Uh

357
00:20:50.824 --> 00:20:53.944
WHERE cows are lent out, uh cows are pledged

358
00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:57.395
as collateral and they're lost to creditors. Uh But

359
00:20:57.405 --> 00:21:00.005
they're not, uh most loans are not uh not

360
00:21:00.015 --> 00:21:00.954
very productive.

361
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.439
So, uh you've already got a little bit into

362
00:21:05.449 --> 00:21:10.130
how interest bearing debt was brought to Greece. We're

363
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.479
also going to talk a little bit about Rome,

364
00:21:12.489 --> 00:21:15.550
which is also something that you explore in your

365
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.569
book, The Collapse of Antiquity. But just before we

366
00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:22.939
get into the examples of Greece and Rome and

367
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:26.290
what happened there? Um, LET me just ask you

368
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.010
perhaps a more general question. Uh, WHAT are the

369
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.250
consequences economically? But I guess we can also say

370
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:41.189
socially and politically, if the debts get too high

371
00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.410
and they are not canceled.

372
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.349
Well, if debts got, uh, uh, too high, uh,

373
00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:51.890
then, uh, the creditors would get too rich and

374
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.430
the problem, uh, if debts got too high, you

375
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:57.560
would have much of the labor falling into bondage

376
00:21:57.569 --> 00:22:01.339
to the creditors. Well, the creditors wanted their labor.

377
00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:03.640
So the labor, if you were in bondage to

378
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.599
a creditor, you'd have to spend your time cultivating

379
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:09.750
his land, not your own land. And if you

380
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.459
had to do that, then number one, you wouldn't

381
00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:15.670
be able to work, uh, at Corvey Labor, uh

382
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.400
at, uh, but because you'd be, uh, working for

383
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.939
the private, uh, uh predator, uh, or you wouldn't

384
00:22:22.949 --> 00:22:25.469
be able to serve in the army because you

385
00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:28.920
were a bond person. Uh, AND, and couldn't serve

386
00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.300
and so the, the, the, the uh there was

387
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.380
something even worse that as you have a creditor

388
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.800
class get wealthy, it became a power in itself

389
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.900
to rival the palace. And uh if you have

390
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.469
the creditor class wanting to rival the palace and

391
00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:49.170
even overthrow the rulers, uh well, the first thing

392
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.569
they would do would be to stop debt cancellation.

393
00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:54.729
That's what happened in antiquity, but it didn't happen

394
00:22:54.739 --> 00:22:57.910
in um uh in the near east because the

395
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.630
near east was able to prevent, to prevent an

396
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.489
independent uh creditor oligarchy from developing. We do find

397
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.770
uh cases of uh some fam creditors who got

398
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.290
very rich, got a lot of land uh from

399
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.300
uh uh that they had foreclosed on from their

400
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.589
creditors. But then uh a generation or two labor,

401
00:23:22.619 --> 00:23:25.109
we don't find them at all. Somehow they were

402
00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:28.530
treated like uh China would treat uh billionaires who

403
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.410
have a little too much money. Uh Somehow uh

404
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.089
uh the lands were all returned to their original

405
00:23:36.219 --> 00:23:39.329
uh owners and this was uh uh we uh

406
00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:44.060
uh this was spelled out in Hammurabi's debt cancellations

407
00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:47.641
and those of his uh grandsons and great grandsons

408
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:51.112
and the uh the debt cancellations are part of

409
00:23:51.121 --> 00:23:55.521
a broader restoration of order in addition to freeing

410
00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:57.541
the bond servants and saying now you don't owe

411
00:23:57.552 --> 00:23:59.281
any more money, you can go back to your

412
00:23:59.291 --> 00:24:02.862
land. Uh AND your slave girls will be returned

413
00:24:02.871 --> 00:24:06.322
to you uh from the creditor, you would also

414
00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:09.904
uh cancel. Uh YOU, you all uh cancel any

415
00:24:09.913 --> 00:24:12.183
of the lands that they lost uh that you

416
00:24:12.193 --> 00:24:14.854
would return the land to them as well as

417
00:24:14.864 --> 00:24:17.813
giving them uh the freedom. So you had debt

418
00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:22.004
cancellation. Uh uh GOING together with freeing the bond

419
00:24:22.014 --> 00:24:25.394
servants and restoring the land. And the word that

420
00:24:25.404 --> 00:24:29.593
Hammurabi used, the Babylonian word was under arm. Well,

421
00:24:29.604 --> 00:24:32.624
this is the word that uh in the Babylonian

422
00:24:32.634 --> 00:24:37.526
captivity. Uh WHEN the Jews were uh relocated to

423
00:24:37.536 --> 00:24:40.345
uh Babylon after they lost the war, they uh

424
00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:44.765
became familiar with all of these mesopotamian practices and

425
00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:47.875
brought them back uh to Judea and the Hebrew

426
00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:51.286
word uh for uh that was used in Leviticus

427
00:24:51.296 --> 00:24:55.385
25. The uh the jubilee was du and D

428
00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:58.375
is the exact cognate to Andar.

429
00:25:00.589 --> 00:25:03.130
Yes, we're also going to get a little bit

430
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.770
into the Bible later in our conversation. But uh

431
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.140
could we say then that there was historically a

432
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.640
relationship between debt and the development of wage labor?

433
00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:20.680
Well, in the sense that uh the, the first

434
00:25:20.689 --> 00:25:24.040
labor for hire was you'd make a loan to

435
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.060
the labor and he would have to uh repay

436
00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:29.680
you by working off the loan. Uh And uh

437
00:25:29.689 --> 00:25:33.540
that was basically uh how you get labor. Well,

438
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.050
pretty soon this idea of lending money and getting

439
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.939
repaid became abbreviated and uh well, we don't have

440
00:25:40.949 --> 00:25:43.459
to go through the lending pro process. We'll just

441
00:25:43.469 --> 00:25:46.275
pay you, uh you know, uh but uh, uh,

442
00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:48.775
uh, pay you for this, uh, instead of you

443
00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:51.375
having to work it off, uh, off a debt,

444
00:25:51.385 --> 00:25:53.685
you know, we'll just, we'll just, uh, uh, uh,

445
00:25:53.694 --> 00:25:56.025
instead of paying you in advance by giving you

446
00:25:56.035 --> 00:25:59.474
a loan, we'll pay you, uh, for, uh, what

447
00:25:59.484 --> 00:26:02.905
you're working on. So, it really was debt bondage.

448
00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:06.885
That, uh, was the first form of, uh, labor

449
00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:12.329
for hire and that, that evolved into it. So,

450
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:15.300
uh, getting more directly into your book, The Collapse

451
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.270
of Antiquity, you've already touched a little bit on

452
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.589
Greece there. But could you tell us how the

453
00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:27.770
rise of creditor and land holding oligarchies happen in

454
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.010
classical Greece and Rome?

455
00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:35.199
You mean uh how, how it happened there? All

456
00:26:35.209 --> 00:26:38.670
right, Greece uh was uh the, the West were

457
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.750
the barbarians uh at this time, all of this

458
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.810
uh base, all of the uh basic elements of

459
00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:49.560
uh e commerce and uh economic relationships were developed

460
00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:53.109
in Mesopotamia and the other near eastern countries. Uh

461
00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:57.500
THERE had been really bad weather around 1200 BC.

462
00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:03.699
You had a depopulation uh of uh uh the

463
00:27:03.709 --> 00:27:05.989
whole near eastern region all the way into the

464
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.530
Mediterranean and you had a population collapse. Uh For

465
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.160
instance, in, in Greece, you had the my Canaan

466
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.439
uh palace economies that used linear b uh the

467
00:27:18.449 --> 00:27:23.979
palace economies fell apart. And uh the, the, the

468
00:27:23.989 --> 00:27:28.640
local uh district managers uh who would manage a,

469
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.579
a local district on behalf of the palace ruler

470
00:27:31.589 --> 00:27:34.040
once there was no more palace ruler, uh the

471
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.719
manager would become uh the local uh king. Uh

472
00:27:37.729 --> 00:27:40.229
uh AND you could see this in, in the

473
00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:43.819
language uh that they had or there were warlords

474
00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:47.130
uh and mafia type uh of people. Well, any

475
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.319
rate by the eighth century BC. And we're talking

476
00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:54.709
about 400 years after uh there was a drought

477
00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:58.380
or uh something like uh a uh a drought

478
00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.689
when this went all the way from India, all

479
00:28:01.699 --> 00:28:04.369
the way to the Mediterranean. It looked like it

480
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.910
was a, a global phenomenon that just uh ended

481
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.339
uh whole cultures. Well, uh by, by the time

482
00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:16.579
the Syrian and the Phoenician traders began to uh

483
00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:20.040
get ships and begin to trade again. They moved

484
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.400
westward into Greece, into Italy and uh they uh

485
00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.739
the people they would deal with you, you'd land

486
00:28:27.849 --> 00:28:31.380
usually on an island right outside uh uh the

487
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.630
big city, sort of a neutral zone. And uh

488
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.709
you would, uh the people you talk to would

489
00:28:36.719 --> 00:28:40.130
be the uh local chieftains. And uh you would

490
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.969
explain to them how the financial system worked and

491
00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:45.050
said, all right, you know, we're going to trade

492
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.109
these goods for uh your goods and uh we

493
00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.010
need to be paid uh in money and uh

494
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.130
we charge interest. So this idea of charging interest

495
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.500
was brought from the near east to uh Greece

496
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.949
and Italy. But Greece and Italy didn't have any

497
00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:06.699
uh palace rulers. Uh They, because they all disappeared

498
00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:09.935
in 1200 BC. Uh They, they all they had

499
00:29:09.944 --> 00:29:12.454
was local chieftains and these were sort of ma

500
00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:16.364
uh either warlord types, uh you know, just sort

501
00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:19.584
of grabbers. So, uh uh they were the, the

502
00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:23.545
people who grabbed power either because they just took,

503
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:27.020
kept the uh uh the local uh means of

504
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.920
production. Uh WHEN the Myan palaces fell apart or

505
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.170
uh they were warlords or they were just local

506
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.119
big men, uh ambitious sort of, you know, it

507
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.939
was a free for all sort of like Russia

508
00:29:38.949 --> 00:29:42.829
after 1991. Uh And uh these are the people

509
00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:45.619
that said, well, all right, this idea of lending

510
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.390
money is very good and they began to lend

511
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.780
money uh to uh other, their countrymen uh and

512
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.949
charge interest, but there was no ruler to cancel

513
00:29:55.959 --> 00:29:59.280
the debts. And so you had uh pretty quickly

514
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.949
uh the powerful families taking over all of the

515
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:07.079
land in uh uh the Greek cities, uh Athens,

516
00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:10.719
Sparta, Corinth. Uh And uh in the various uh

517
00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:15.219
Italian cities uh uh uh whether it was uh

518
00:30:15.229 --> 00:30:19.030
Rome or the Etruscan cities or others. And these

519
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.660
cities were not very uh pleasant, uh uh pleasant

520
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.900
places to live. And uh you had uh the

521
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.089
kind uh you, you had in the West, what

522
00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:32.569
would have happened in Mesopotamia if they didn't cancel

523
00:30:32.579 --> 00:30:36.869
the debts, you had a creditor oligarchy developing. Well,

524
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.189
uh there was a revolution almost everywhere. Finally, the

525
00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:44.099
people rose up. I shouldn't say the people. Uh

526
00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:47.119
THERE were uh most of these revolutions uh like

527
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.479
in Corinth. Uh IT'S, it's uh uh organ. It's

528
00:30:50.489 --> 00:30:54.430
shown the best. Uh You had minor uh members

529
00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:58.079
of the wealthy family saying this isn't fair. Well,

530
00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.209
maybe they thought it wasn't fair that they didn't

531
00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:02.130
get as much as the richer members of the

532
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:06.176
family, but they led the populist revolution, they overthrown

533
00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:10.135
the mafia type uh dictators, by the way, uh

534
00:31:10.145 --> 00:31:13.816
uh A lot of classical historians use the word

535
00:31:13.826 --> 00:31:19.556
mafia mafiosi uh type uh uh leaders for what

536
00:31:19.566 --> 00:31:21.995
was before the eighth century. It's not my term.

537
00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:24.536
Uh I picked it up from Von W and

538
00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:26.765
other people that have, that have used it. So

539
00:31:26.865 --> 00:31:29.635
uh they would uh they would overthrow it and

540
00:31:29.645 --> 00:31:33.421
uh they would uh do essentially what the Mesopotamian

541
00:31:33.432 --> 00:31:37.082
rulers did. They say, OK, we've overthrown uh the

542
00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:39.482
uh wealthy people that have kept you in debt.

543
00:31:39.491 --> 00:31:43.151
We're canceling the debts and we're redistributing the land

544
00:31:43.161 --> 00:31:45.511
so you can all have the land and we're

545
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:47.661
gonna be good rulers. We're going to develop uh

546
00:31:47.671 --> 00:31:51.702
public infrastructure. Uh We're going to develop trade. Uh

547
00:31:51.712 --> 00:31:54.911
We're going to develop uh commerce. Uh We're, we're

548
00:31:54.921 --> 00:31:57.102
going to make you all rich. That's what happened

549
00:31:57.112 --> 00:32:01.300
in Corin uh in uh Sparta. Uh There was

550
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.979
uh a similar uh fight and uh they said,

551
00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:06.410
well, we're not only going to cancel debts, we're

552
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.729
gonna get rid of money itself, we're not going

553
00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:11.479
to use silver. Uh We are going to use

554
00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:14.739
a kind of uh iron. Uh But we just

555
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.800
to make sure that you don't think that money

556
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.380
is a commodity that you realize that money is

557
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.449
uh A P created by the public sector. Uh

558
00:32:23.469 --> 00:32:27.339
We're going to dip the iron when we make

559
00:32:27.349 --> 00:32:29.869
it in vinegar. Uh So that it's uh all

560
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.550
blistered and it's not, not practical. Uh And uh

561
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.869
so that they got rid of the uh actual

562
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:42.579
money. Although the uh the Spartan uh elites kept

563
00:32:42.589 --> 00:32:47.130
the, kept their own property in Sparta itself. And

564
00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.739
it was on the land outside of Sparta that

565
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:54.560
Sparta essentially uh conquered the neighboring uh uh uh

566
00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:58.479
uh population and made them into hills, which is

567
00:32:58.489 --> 00:33:01.040
a kind of serfdom where they had to work,

568
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.780
supplying food for uh the Spartan uh Khoo, the

569
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:10.244
equals uh uh Martin men. Well, uh finally, by

570
00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:15.005
490 BC, you had uh the, the most backward

571
00:33:15.015 --> 00:33:18.895
country in uh uh uh city state in Greece,

572
00:33:18.905 --> 00:33:22.895
uh Athens finally had its own uh revolution. Uh

573
00:33:22.974 --> 00:33:26.444
And they wanted to do in Athens what they'd

574
00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:29.074
done in these other countries. And so uh uh

575
00:33:29.084 --> 00:33:34.675
to prevent a revolution, they appointed uh solo as

576
00:33:34.685 --> 00:33:37.094
uh so as the Arcon, meaning OK, you're going

577
00:33:37.104 --> 00:33:39.089
to be the ruler, you'll settle things. Uh uh

578
00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:43.699
Solo canceled uh the debts, mainly the mortgage debts

579
00:33:43.709 --> 00:33:45.819
uh that held the people to the land. Uh

580
00:33:45.829 --> 00:33:48.939
We're still not sure exactly what happened, but he

581
00:33:48.949 --> 00:33:51.569
did cancel the debts, but he didn't redistribute the

582
00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:55.930
land and uh that disappointed the population so much

583
00:33:55.939 --> 00:33:58.449
that uh uh they sort of forced solo into

584
00:33:58.459 --> 00:34:02.040
exile. And uh the, the real fight for democracy

585
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.400
was led by uh as it is today by

586
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:09.495
people who uh the creditors call uh dictators or

587
00:34:09.504 --> 00:34:14.455
parents. Uh And that was uh uh uh uh

588
00:34:14.465 --> 00:34:18.004
the followers through the balance of the uh six

589
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:21.735
sixth centuries uh who had uh bodyguards uh uh

590
00:34:21.745 --> 00:34:24.965
and everything. Until finally, by the end of the

591
00:34:24.975 --> 00:34:28.885
sixth century, uh you had another minor member of

592
00:34:28.895 --> 00:34:31.965
one of the richest families in Greece, uh Kleist

593
00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:39.188
who was an al uh family uh doing uh

594
00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:44.330
what Stalin never really did and re reorganized uh

595
00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:48.610
the voting system and really created the Athenian democracy.

596
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.000
You uh you had uh Stalin uh Solon gave

597
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.610
uh uh when he left the Pisistratus uh was

598
00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.449
taken over, he was called a dictator because he

599
00:34:59.459 --> 00:35:03.540
was a populist and supported uh democracy for the

600
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.810
people. He was uh starting a building, he was

601
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.709
uh putting the people to work and giving them

602
00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:11.989
jobs. Uh And uh so of course, he was

603
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.800
denounced by, by the other people. Finally, uh you

604
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.530
have placed the needs that established a democracy. So

605
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.479
you, you had um but all the same you

606
00:35:21.489 --> 00:35:25.949
never had in Greece or Rome uh a ruler

607
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:28.669
that would cancel the deaths for five centuries. You

608
00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:32.120
had the populations Revo uh revolting in civil war.

609
00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:35.389
They wanted to get back to uh uh uh

610
00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:39.840
a ruler that uh was like the me, the

611
00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:44.060
mesopotamian rulers like Hammurabi or the Sumerians, the others

612
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.979
have canceled the deaths. And, and Teko never had

613
00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:51.639
that. And that's what made western civilization different from

614
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.899
uh uh the uh the Middle Eastern civilization. They

615
00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:59.739
didn't have a central ruler ruler. The uh so-called

616
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.360
democracy wanted uh a central uh uh the debts

617
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.600
to be canceled, they wanted the land to be

618
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.280
redistributed. Uh And so, uh Aristotle, when he wrote

619
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:13.120
a study of the Greek constitutions said, well, uh

620
00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:16.840
all the constitutions call themselves democratic, but they're really

621
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.419
oligarchy. Uh BECAUSE under a democracy, you're going to

622
00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:23.649
have wealthy people developing and they uh uh become

623
00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:27.530
an oligarchy and then they make themselves hereditary into

624
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.570
an aristocracy. And finally, some member of the aristocracy,

625
00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.989
fights with other members of the aristocracy and takes

626
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.840
the people into their camp. In other words, becomes

627
00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:40.239
a populist and said, hey, I want your support

628
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.629
in overthrowing this aristocracy and the whole thing starts

629
00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:44.409
all over again.

630
00:36:45.689 --> 00:36:48.330
So, uh I mean, of course, the question I'm

631
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.790
about to ask you is probably something that you

632
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.560
would be exploring more in your referred book of

633
00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.500
this trilogy. But this is uh a historical legacy

634
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.709
that we in the West got from Greece and

635
00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:09.429
Italy, specifically Roman uh was still alive. I mean,

636
00:37:09.439 --> 00:37:12.070
centuries later, right?

637
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.250
You're saying what is the legacy that we have?

638
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:16.469
Uh The

639
00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:21.919
there is this historical legacy of uh not having

640
00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:25.439
uh that consolation when it's necessary that

641
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.250
we will legacy with the dark age. You could

642
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.070
say the legacy was uh the oligarchy took over

643
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.870
Rome ended up uh conquering Greece and uh all

644
00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:38.485
the other areas. Uh And it was the most

645
00:37:38.495 --> 00:37:42.784
uh vicious oligarchy. Rome began uh uh uh essentially

646
00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:47.064
as a city of refuge, uh meaning runaways. Uh

647
00:37:47.074 --> 00:37:50.604
And in uh one of one of the reasons

648
00:37:50.614 --> 00:37:53.344
I should have said that the Babylonian rule is

649
00:37:53.354 --> 00:37:56.125
canceled, the debs is if they wouldn't have canceled

650
00:37:56.135 --> 00:37:59.274
the debts and the bond uh persons, the, the

651
00:37:59.284 --> 00:38:02.770
bond servants would have simply run away. Uh And

652
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.070
there was a labor shortage. Uh All the, in

653
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.610
archaic times, everybody really wanted to get labor. That

654
00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.709
was the golden time to be a laborer because

655
00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:14.189
everybody wanted you to be their part of their

656
00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:17.699
community. Well, uh what Rome uh said was uh

657
00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:21.040
well, we're here, we are um on the Tiber

658
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.590
River. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. Nobody

659
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.909
really wants to live here. It's uh uh there's

660
00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:28.699
a uh uh uh water is good for trade

661
00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:31.482
but not good. Uh You don't want mosquitoes uh

662
00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:34.002
around. So, how are we going to get people

663
00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:37.742
here? Well, the kings of uh of uh Rome

664
00:38:37.752 --> 00:38:40.413
said, all right, uh fugitives if you come here.

665
00:38:40.472 --> 00:38:43.383
Uh And uh you're not able to get uh

666
00:38:43.393 --> 00:38:46.833
much land for yourself or an alternative to bondage.

667
00:38:46.843 --> 00:38:51.762
And uh these other nasty Italian uh uh mafia

668
00:38:51.772 --> 00:38:54.183
uh communities that there are come on to here,

669
00:38:54.193 --> 00:38:56.492
we'll give you land, we'll, we'll treat you fairly.

670
00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:59.615
And so uh Rome became uh a magnet uh

671
00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:02.456
for people uh to grow rapidly and uh the

672
00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:06.815
kings took over. Uh BUT also you had, by

673
00:39:06.825 --> 00:39:10.815
the late uh uh sixth century, uh uh the

674
00:39:10.825 --> 00:39:14.525
late uh five hundreds, you had even Aristocrats uh

675
00:39:14.535 --> 00:39:18.075
in other Italian cities fighting with each other. And

676
00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:20.575
uh mo uh moving to Rome and uh they

677
00:39:20.585 --> 00:39:23.885
merged with other aristocrats and they overthrew the kings.

678
00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:26.790
And when they overthrew the kings, they stopped the

679
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.350
ability of kings to treat the uh population uh

680
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.540
fairly. And uh they introduced the class war and

681
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.149
immediately clamped down on the population. And uh we're

682
00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:39.300
not gonna, uh you know, if you fall into

683
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.070
debt, uh you're going to be our debt servants

684
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.629
forever. There's no reversibility of debt. If there was,

685
00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:50.229
there's no circular time, there's linear time. Uh You

686
00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:52.540
lose the land, that's it. You're not gonna get

687
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.683
it back. Well, in the 490 the uh uh

688
00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:58.923
citizens of Rome, there was a walkout. It's called

689
00:39:58.933 --> 00:40:02.272
the Secession of the Plebs in 490. And uh

690
00:40:02.282 --> 00:40:04.443
they decided to walk out and said, well, you

691
00:40:04.452 --> 00:40:05.552
know, we're not going to be a part of

692
00:40:05.562 --> 00:40:08.103
your community. Uh It, it was a nice all

693
00:40:08.193 --> 00:40:10.603
uh well, it lasted. But uh we're gonna go

694
00:40:10.613 --> 00:40:13.732
somewhere else. So there was a lot of negotiation

695
00:40:13.742 --> 00:40:15.923
and then they realized, well, where are we going

696
00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:18.593
to go? Because all the other cities around us

697
00:40:18.603 --> 00:40:22.115
are pretty rotten oligarchies too. So they came back

698
00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:25.756
with the oligarchy making promise. But an a, an

699
00:40:25.766 --> 00:40:28.375
ancient oligarchy making a promise to the people is

700
00:40:28.385 --> 00:40:30.885
sort of like the United States making a promise

701
00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:34.335
to uh other countries internationally. You know, they immediately

702
00:40:34.345 --> 00:40:37.176
broke uh uh all of their words and there

703
00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:42.726
was another uh walkout in uh about 450 BC

704
00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:45.575
and they said, look, uh we've got it right.

705
00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:48.696
We're not gonna trust you again. Uh What you

706
00:40:48.706 --> 00:40:51.689
promise us, write it all down. So they wrote

707
00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.820
the law of the 12 tables and that's where

708
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.129
they established. Here's the interest rate that you have

709
00:40:56.139 --> 00:40:58.909
to pay here are the terms. Uh uh THEY

710
00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:02.120
at least wrote everything down. Uh And what they

711
00:41:02.129 --> 00:41:05.669
wrote was a pretty oligarchic uh set of laws.

712
00:41:05.679 --> 00:41:12.330
Well, uh this uh tradition of a creditor oriented

713
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.449
laws, all debts must be paid. There's not going

714
00:41:15.459 --> 00:41:18.310
to be any debt forgiveness. Uh Once you lose

715
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.229
land or sell it, you're never going to get

716
00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:24.070
it back. Linear time. All this whole Roman spirit

717
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.070
of the law is oligarchies uh can control society.

718
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.389
Uh OR uh there's no, not ever going to

719
00:41:30.399 --> 00:41:33.989
be a democracy under our rule. That is what

720
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.310
uh uh polarized, more and more every century there

721
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.000
were revolts against uh the oligarchy and they all

722
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.729
failed because the oligarchy was uh uh controlled uh

723
00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:49.489
the uh the heavily armed uh military and uh

724
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.649
essentially political assassination again already in uh uh Rome

725
00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:57.610
uh from the same policy that the United States

726
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.570
does. If there's somebody who's uh uh advocating uh

727
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.590
uh fair, fair parade for uh for the people,

728
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.500
you know, fair deal, you assassinate him. And uh

729
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.489
the Roman history is marked with political assassination just

730
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.260
like the United States does in uh throughout Latin

731
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.610
America and other countries. And, or uh what, what

732
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.469
it uh uh Israel is just done uh uh

733
00:42:21.479 --> 00:42:26.830
against the Iranian uh uh Iranian fin uh uh

734
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.370
consulate in uh in Syria. So uh political assassination

735
00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:35.939
and finally, there was uh in the first century

736
00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:41.060
BC, there was outright war uh in uh uh

737
00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:46.600
uh the uh Cataline uh wa was a uh

738
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.070
one of the Aristocrats. Almost all the, the revolutions

739
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.959
were led by Aristocrats. Uh NOT some uh but

740
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:55.919
they would mobilize the people. Uh And uh they

741
00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:59.280
would uh get together uh and essentially take the

742
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.360
people in, into their camp as a populist and

743
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.919
try to fight, they were utterly destroyed. Uh And

744
00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:09.290
finally, uh one of the early supporters of Cataline

745
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:13.919
Julius Caesar uh organized an army uh uh marched

746
00:43:13.929 --> 00:43:17.800
on Rome uh became uh uh the leader and

747
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.879
we all know what happened to him. He was

748
00:43:19.889 --> 00:43:22.620
uh uh uh that he was killed, uh, uh,

749
00:43:22.629 --> 00:43:25.280
in the Senate. And, uh, the result is that

750
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.620
Rome got, uh, uh, essentially was, ended up the

751
00:43:29.629 --> 00:43:34.669
Roman Empire in a series of large, uh, manners

752
00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:37.820
held by the, on the land held by the

753
00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:42.080
wealthiest families. And, uh, the, uh, trade dried up

754
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:46.659
the population shrunk. And, uh, uh, you ended up

755
00:43:46.669 --> 00:43:49.090
with a dark age, uh, which is what happens

756
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.679
when you don't cancel the debts. You don't redistribute

757
00:43:51.689 --> 00:43:54.060
the land and you, uh you po uh when

758
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:58.439
a society polarizes and uh sucks all the income

759
00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:01.649
and control over labor to a narrow elite at

760
00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:05.699
the top of the pyramid, a creditor, landowning oligarchy,

761
00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.790
the results always going to be a dark age

762
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.090
because uh you've killed the internal market, you've killed

763
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.590
uh all uh forms of economic growth.

764
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:19.919
So all of these factors, political, social, economic that

765
00:44:19.929 --> 00:44:26.699
derived from this sort of progra ideology contributed ultimately

766
00:44:26.709 --> 00:44:30.219
also to the fall of the Roman Empire.

767
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.229
Correct? Yes. Yes. Uh That's what oligarchies do by

768
00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:37.139
the. So I just like, uh in the United

769
00:44:37.149 --> 00:44:41.184
States and Europe today, uh, you have uh financial

770
00:44:41.194 --> 00:44:45.964
oligarchy emerging and the result is deindustrialization because if

771
00:44:45.974 --> 00:44:48.823
you impoverish the economy, you're not going to have

772
00:44:48.833 --> 00:44:52.614
industry anymore. Uh YOU'RE going to have uh basically

773
00:44:52.624 --> 00:44:57.134
self sufficient uh uh enclaves of uh uh a

774
00:44:57.144 --> 00:45:01.503
few families, uh run everything. And uh basically the

775
00:45:01.513 --> 00:45:05.414
problem with the financial sector with predators throughout history

776
00:45:05.424 --> 00:45:08.478
is live in the short run. Uh THEY don't

777
00:45:08.488 --> 00:45:10.917
care that they're bringing a dark age. All they

778
00:45:10.927 --> 00:45:13.758
care about is right now, uh, just like corporate

779
00:45:13.768 --> 00:45:15.998
managers just care. Well, you know, what are the

780
00:45:16.008 --> 00:45:18.248
earnings going to be in the next quarter? What

781
00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:20.587
are the years earnings going to be, uh, on

782
00:45:20.597 --> 00:45:23.437
which my bonuses are based? And so they lead

783
00:45:23.447 --> 00:45:26.937
the corporation instead of using uh, the corporate profits

784
00:45:26.947 --> 00:45:30.758
to, uh, make new factories and new, new machinery,

785
00:45:30.768 --> 00:45:33.961
more labor and uh production. They say, well, we're

786
00:45:33.971 --> 00:45:36.082
not going to reinvest profits. We're not going to

787
00:45:36.092 --> 00:45:39.312
put money into research and development because we're going

788
00:45:39.322 --> 00:45:41.511
to be leaving the company by then. Let's just

789
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:44.501
use all the profits to pay dividends to push

790
00:45:44.511 --> 00:45:47.011
up the stock price. And let's use the profits

791
00:45:47.021 --> 00:45:49.662
for stock buybacks and uh we'll make the stock

792
00:45:49.672 --> 00:45:52.971
go up and our uh bonuses are based on

793
00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:55.562
what we do uh with the stock. So uh

794
00:45:55.572 --> 00:46:00.506
essentially the financial sector uh today is uh really

795
00:46:00.516 --> 00:46:03.275
doing just what uh the financial sector did in

796
00:46:03.285 --> 00:46:06.645
Roman Times. They ended up uh lending money to

797
00:46:06.656 --> 00:46:10.446
uh other parts of the richest part of the

798
00:46:10.456 --> 00:46:14.565
uh uh neighboring uh geographic area, which is Asia

799
00:46:14.575 --> 00:46:17.906
minor. Uh They essentially took over uh the, they

800
00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:21.365
looted the temples, they looted the palace uh of

801
00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:24.850
uh all the money. They, they uh uh they

802
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.959
were, they didn't what Margaret Thatcher would have done.

803
00:46:26.979 --> 00:46:31.479
They privatized all of the public uh uh utilities

804
00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:35.760
and uh essentially impoverished the population and uh uh

805
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.879
uh what they did to Asian miner. Uh THERE

806
00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:42.429
was a revolution there by Mithridates uh that, that

807
00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:46.000
uh ended up uh uh on one occasion killing

808
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:51.773
80,000 Romans who had gone uh throughout the near

809
00:46:51.783 --> 00:46:56.293
east as public and uh tax collectors or creditors

810
00:46:56.303 --> 00:47:00.093
or just advent uh financial ventures and merchants uh

811
00:47:00.104 --> 00:47:04.194
uh Rome retaliated. Uh NOT only against Asian Miner,

812
00:47:04.204 --> 00:47:07.293
but it destroyed Athens totally uh wiped it out,

813
00:47:07.354 --> 00:47:12.654
uh destroyed Sparta uh almost uh totally. Uh AND

814
00:47:12.684 --> 00:47:15.739
uh uh uh tried to lay waste uh uh

815
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.139
to the whole world. They, they did to, to

816
00:47:18.149 --> 00:47:20.360
the rest of Greece. Uh WHAT the United States

817
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.530
has done to Latin America, Libya and much of

818
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.010
the near east, you could say they were the

819
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.870
first Americans in terms of foreign policy.

820
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.590
So let me just ask you a little bit

821
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.149
about Christianity here because of course, we in the

822
00:47:36.159 --> 00:47:40.229
in the West also have uh the Christian legacy.

823
00:47:40.239 --> 00:47:45.429
But curiously enough, it seems that at least early

824
00:47:45.439 --> 00:47:51.620
Christianity and also according to some Eero and biblical

825
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:57.250
scholars, uh was more preoccupied with uh things like

826
00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:02.469
that, forgiveness than uh sin, for example. So, could

827
00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:04.969
you, could you tell us about that? How early

828
00:48:04.979 --> 00:48:08.989
Christians uh I mean, what were the main worries

829
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.469
of early Christians, let's say,

830
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.879
well, the, the early Christians were Jewish uh and

831
00:48:15.889 --> 00:48:20.189
uh uh Jesus uh uh was uh uh Jewish

832
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.280
and within Israel uh there had been a, a

833
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.320
whole fight Israel had. Yeah, it, it, it looks

834
00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.439
like from the Jewish Bible that uh the Jewish

835
00:48:29.449 --> 00:48:32.760
religion, uh and the Jewish Bible was uh the

836
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.840
product of what really was a civil war because

837
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:39.739
by the first century, uh the kings uh throughout

838
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.615
the whole uh uh but especially uh in Israel

839
00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:46.156
uh were not the kind of the kings of

840
00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:51.256
Hammurabi were uh Assyria. Assyrian kings canceled the debts.

841
00:48:51.266 --> 00:48:55.176
Babylonian kings canceled the debts, but uh not uh

842
00:48:55.206 --> 00:49:00.266
uh uh the uh Judea uh and Israel were

843
00:49:00.275 --> 00:49:02.885
uh on way on the western periphery of all

844
00:49:02.895 --> 00:49:06.501
this. And so, uh uh uh the Jewish Bible

845
00:49:06.511 --> 00:49:09.191
is sort of unique. And instead of saying here,

846
00:49:09.201 --> 00:49:11.721
uh the wonderful things that the kings did, uh

847
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:14.392
most of the kings are pretty bad. Uh And

848
00:49:14.402 --> 00:49:18.622
as a result, uh Israel broke away from uh

849
00:49:18.632 --> 00:49:21.491
uh Judea and said, uh you know, we don't

850
00:49:21.501 --> 00:49:24.572
have any uh uh you, you're not really for

851
00:49:24.582 --> 00:49:26.951
us, you're trying to just exploit us. What uh

852
00:49:26.961 --> 00:49:29.322
what do we have in the sons of Jesse

853
00:49:29.541 --> 00:49:33.038
uh meaning uh uh thing. Uh And uh you

854
00:49:33.048 --> 00:49:38.758
had uh the prophets uh uh Isaiah uh Mika,

855
00:49:38.768 --> 00:49:41.748
uh all, all of the other prophets uh denouncing

856
00:49:41.758 --> 00:49:44.768
uh the wealthy who would put uh uh plot

857
00:49:44.778 --> 00:49:47.427
to plot and house to house together in big

858
00:49:47.437 --> 00:49:49.847
estate until there was no room for people in

859
00:49:49.857 --> 00:49:53.028
the land. Uh Well, uh the result of that

860
00:49:53.038 --> 00:49:57.593
was that when the uh when the Jew lost

861
00:49:57.604 --> 00:50:01.983
the war to Babylonia, uh the wealthiest families and

862
00:50:01.993 --> 00:50:05.214
uh some uh uh most powerful uh families were

863
00:50:05.224 --> 00:50:09.573
exiled uh to Babylonia. Well, in Babylonia, uh we

864
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:13.503
have uh the cuneiform records. Uh Cornelia Wunsch has

865
00:50:13.513 --> 00:50:16.343
been uh translating all of these uh records and

866
00:50:16.354 --> 00:50:19.164
has just published a whole book uh on uh

867
00:50:19.174 --> 00:50:21.224
the Jewish life there. And you could see that

868
00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:25.229
most of the Jews pretty uh acclimatized. Uh They

869
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:28.919
uh they uh uh adopted the uh they assimilated

870
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:33.449
and uh adopted the Babylonian rules. And uh finally,

871
00:50:33.459 --> 00:50:36.699
uh you had uh the Persian Empire under Cyrus

872
00:50:36.709 --> 00:50:41.580
uh uh conquering Babylonia and throughout the ancient world

873
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.570
all the way down through the European middle ages

874
00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:50.100
when uh uh one and imperial country would conquer

875
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.639
another, they left, they didn't just kill all of

876
00:50:53.649 --> 00:50:56.889
the leaders of the country uh uh that they

877
00:50:56.899 --> 00:50:59.889
canceled only the Christians did that. Uh uh uh

878
00:50:59.899 --> 00:51:03.500
uh BEFORE there was Christianity, you would leave the

879
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:08.770
local administrators in place. And so uh uh the

880
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.790
uh the Persians uh left the Babylonian administrators in

881
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.229
place and uh and uh the uh permitted uh

882
00:51:17.239 --> 00:51:20.689
religious uh freedom, there was no attempt to say,

883
00:51:20.699 --> 00:51:23.159
you have to believe what we believe. That's uh

884
00:51:23.169 --> 00:51:26.620
Catholicism. Uh BUT that didn't exist in the ancient

885
00:51:26.629 --> 00:51:29.330
world. So, uh you had the Jews saying, well,

886
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.110
you know, we'd like to go back to uh

887
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.610
Israel. So uh around the sixth century, uh they

888
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:39.149
uh you had uh the return, Ezra and Nehemiah

889
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.300
uh uh uh uh in uh Nehemiah uh who

890
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:46.780
became sort of the local uh he was uh

891
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.179
of the local leader. Uh He, he, he, he,

892
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:52.600
his autobiography is one of the chapters in uh

893
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:56.060
the Jewish Bible. No sign of debt cancellation there.

894
00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.290
But Ezra sort of uh uh led the whole

895
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.939
group of stri scribes that was saying now let's

896
00:52:02.209 --> 00:52:05.810
really put the whole, let's uh tie everything together

897
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.879
in the whole Bible. It was there that they

898
00:52:07.889 --> 00:52:12.795
took the Babylonian under our own debt cancellation and,

899
00:52:12.805 --> 00:52:15.906
and uh translated it to roar and made it

900
00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:18.835
uh put it right in the center of Mosaic

901
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:22.156
Law in Leviticus 25. As if this is the

902
00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:24.916
command of Moses in the very beginning, you've got

903
00:52:24.926 --> 00:52:28.275
to cancel the debts uh every fif 50 years.

904
00:52:28.285 --> 00:52:31.716
And because the kings uh at that time, uh

905
00:52:31.726 --> 00:52:33.976
uh you know, the middle of the first millennium

906
00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:37.802
BC were no longer the near eastern type things.

907
00:52:37.812 --> 00:52:41.092
Uh They, they took the idea of debt cancellation

908
00:52:41.102 --> 00:52:43.721
out of the hand of rulers and put it

909
00:52:43.731 --> 00:52:46.092
in the hands of the religious uh plan, the

910
00:52:46.102 --> 00:52:49.451
religious leaders. Uh And that's why they said uh

911
00:52:49.481 --> 00:52:53.312
they uh they said uh the uh religious power

912
00:52:53.322 --> 00:52:57.741
has power over the secular rulers uh because the

913
00:52:57.751 --> 00:53:00.852
secular rulers are out for themselves. And we as

914
00:53:00.862 --> 00:53:05.429
the religious group uh are trying to uh preserve

915
00:53:05.439 --> 00:53:07.939
the fact that yes, there was a social war

916
00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:10.370
uh in the Jewish lands. And uh we uh

917
00:53:10.379 --> 00:53:16.560
we uh insist on having uh li uh preventing

918
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:20.050
our population from falling into debt bondage and losing

919
00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.169
its land. Well, uh because uh most of the

920
00:53:24.179 --> 00:53:29.219
uh Jewish uh records were not, uh kept on

921
00:53:29.229 --> 00:53:32.840
play. Uh AND uh their perish, we really don't

922
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.629
know very much about what happened from the uh

923
00:53:35.639 --> 00:53:40.570
fifth century BC down to uh Jesus's time. But

924
00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.889
uh in terms of the uh financial relationships and

925
00:53:43.899 --> 00:53:47.469
the everyday debt relationship. But uh we know when

926
00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:51.260
uh Jesus uh came to give his first sermon,

927
00:53:51.389 --> 00:53:54.696
uh uh when he went back uh uh to

928
00:53:54.706 --> 00:53:58.716
his uh home uh hometown, he uh opened uh

929
00:53:58.726 --> 00:54:02.575
the scroll of Isaiah uh talking about uh uh

930
00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:06.246
the jubilee year and said I have come to

931
00:54:06.256 --> 00:54:10.125
proclaim the J the jubilee year. He was fighting

932
00:54:10.135 --> 00:54:14.456
against uh the rabbi school. The wealthy Jews had,

933
00:54:14.466 --> 00:54:17.476
uh sort of uh done uh what almost all

934
00:54:17.552 --> 00:54:21.451
happens to religion, the wealthiest classes take over religion.

935
00:54:21.652 --> 00:54:25.731
And uh the rabbinical school, especially Hillel uh had

936
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:29.812
uh uh tried to reject the jubilee and he'd

937
00:54:29.822 --> 00:54:33.211
introduced something called the pro school. In other words,

938
00:54:33.221 --> 00:54:35.711
when you would, uh the debtor would sign an

939
00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:39.231
IOU he would sign something. I waive my rights

940
00:54:39.241 --> 00:54:42.241
under the uh jubilee rate, uh so that you

941
00:54:42.251 --> 00:54:45.669
can't do it well, uh similar uh uh way

942
00:54:45.679 --> 00:54:48.860
back in 1750 BC and the uh in the,

943
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.560
in the 1650 BC. Uh, THE creditors had tried

944
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:56.850
to have that same clause in the cuneiform documents,

945
00:54:56.929 --> 00:55:02.860
uh, especially under, uh, Hammurabi's great grandson. Um, uh,

946
00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:07.320
I, uh, great Bronson. Uh I can't pronounce the

947
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:11.060
name of it. Uh, BUT, and we have the,

948
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.229
uh, legal record and, uh, the court said this

949
00:55:14.239 --> 00:55:17.189
is illegal, you're not allowed to have to waive

950
00:55:17.199 --> 00:55:20.780
your rights. Well, in, uh, Judea, uh, they were

951
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.024
Judah, they were allowed to, uh, the rabbi said,

952
00:55:24.034 --> 00:55:27.324
uh yes, uh you can waive your rights. Jesus

953
00:55:27.334 --> 00:55:30.965
is fighting against them. And so, uh in uh

954
00:55:30.975 --> 00:55:34.695
uh the uh book of Luke, uh Luke describes,

955
00:55:34.705 --> 00:55:37.304
uh Jesus giving his speech and said, he was

956
00:55:37.314 --> 00:55:41.794
immediately attacked by uh the Pharisees uh who loved

957
00:55:41.804 --> 00:55:44.625
money. Uh Meaning that they were the wealthy class

958
00:55:44.635 --> 00:55:47.209
and they, they, there was a whole uh war

959
00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:50.659
and uh that was why uh the wealthy class

960
00:55:50.669 --> 00:55:55.179
of uh uh of uh Judah, uh I insisted,

961
00:55:55.189 --> 00:55:58.899
uh that the Romans uh uh kill, kill Jesus

962
00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:02.550
because he was uh getting the whole people back

963
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:07.129
trying to uh retain the whole spirit of Judaism

964
00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:11.235
that was in most the law. Uh And so,

965
00:56:11.245 --> 00:56:15.284
uh uh uh he, one of the speeches that's

966
00:56:15.294 --> 00:56:18.915
uh in uh the Jewish Bible is the, the

967
00:56:18.925 --> 00:56:22.445
sermon on the mount. And that's where, uh one

968
00:56:22.455 --> 00:56:25.754
of the lines is what uh uh became the

969
00:56:25.764 --> 00:56:29.114
Lord's prayer, forgive us our debts just as we

970
00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:32.669
forget, forgive the debtors. Well, you can imagine how

971
00:56:32.679 --> 00:56:38.449
this, uh, uh, once, uh, Christianity, uh, Constantine, uh,

972
00:56:38.459 --> 00:56:42.709
large, uh, the Roman women especially, uh, became Christians,

973
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:46.429
they converted the husbands, uh, Constantine made, uh, uh,

974
00:56:46.439 --> 00:56:51.010
Christianity, the, uh, Roman religion. And, but the Roman,

975
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:55.741
uh, religion again, who, who, uh, administers a religion,

976
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:59.392
the wealthiest classes, uh, uh, and, uh, the, the,

977
00:56:59.402 --> 00:57:01.392
the one, the first thing they had to do

978
00:57:01.402 --> 00:57:04.382
was let's kill all the Jews, uh, because, uh,

979
00:57:04.392 --> 00:57:08.471
we don't want anyone to have any reference uh

980
00:57:08.481 --> 00:57:12.491
uh uh to what early Christianity was. So, in

981
00:57:12.501 --> 00:57:17.011
Cyril of Alexandria, uh uh one of the authors

982
00:57:17.021 --> 00:57:20.823
of the, the concept of the Trinity uh organized

983
00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:24.253
whole teams to go throughout Alexandria, uh which was

984
00:57:24.263 --> 00:57:26.593
about one third of the population of Jewish, uh

985
00:57:26.604 --> 00:57:29.874
just trying to kill them. But Trinity was formed

986
00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:33.684
as an anti Semitic religion. Uh And because most

987
00:57:33.694 --> 00:57:37.444
of the early Christians were Jewish. Uh And so,

988
00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:39.624
uh you had under the form of the Trinity

989
00:57:39.634 --> 00:57:42.895
immediate, you had, well, what is Jesus? Well, you

990
00:57:42.906 --> 00:57:46.375
couldn't really have Jesus as an individual person who

991
00:57:46.385 --> 00:57:50.496
was leading the uh the fight for uh canceling

992
00:57:50.506 --> 00:57:53.236
the deaths. And we, we know from the, uh

993
00:57:53.246 --> 00:57:56.575
when the Romans came in to uh were threatening

994
00:57:56.696 --> 00:58:01.875
uh uh Judea, the uh uh uh the librarians

995
00:58:01.885 --> 00:58:06.199
uh in uh took uh all of the sacred

996
00:58:06.209 --> 00:58:08.909
books of Judaism uh from Jerusalem and they, they

997
00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:13.040
put them in uh uh in jars and these

998
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.260
were the dead sea thrills and we know from

999
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:17.770
the Dead Sea thrills that there was a whole

1000
00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.540
group of people, uh a widespread advocacy of debt

1001
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.780
cancellation, especially around followers of uh Melda. Uh I

1002
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.850
give all of the quotations of these documents uh

1003
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.510
in the book. Well, uh the idea was you

1004
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.189
had to get rid of the uh the, the

1005
00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:38.709
whole idea that Jesus was a human being and

1006
00:58:38.719 --> 00:58:40.909
part of a social war because we don't want

1007
00:58:40.919 --> 00:58:43.439
any history of that social war. Uh So Jesus

1008
00:58:43.449 --> 00:58:45.419
really wasn't a human being. He was part of

1009
00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:48.260
God, his body was part of God. Uh Nothing

1010
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.260
about Jewish Thera because God is God and God

1011
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:54.310
is a Christian God. Uh WHO uh Jesus uh

1012
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.830
said Saint Peter. Uh I, I give uh this,

1013
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.939
uh I uh I le I leave uh the

1014
00:59:00.949 --> 00:59:03.889
administration of the church to Saint Peter. Uh THAT

1015
00:59:03.899 --> 00:59:06.379
turned out to be a, a forgery that so

1016
00:59:06.485 --> 00:59:10.185
called donation of Constantine where the Pope said, well,

1017
00:59:10.195 --> 00:59:13.014
uh we're the, the heirs of uh uh of

1018
00:59:13.024 --> 00:59:18.195
Jesus. Well, in addition to uh uh Cyril of

1019
00:59:18.205 --> 00:59:22.784
Alexandria, you have probably the most evil uh uh

1020
00:59:22.794 --> 00:59:26.925
uh of the early Christians who really de uh

1021
00:59:26.935 --> 00:59:31.264
uh uh pushed it on a detour, Saint Augustine

1022
00:59:31.594 --> 00:59:35.389
uh there. Uh He was in North Africa and

1023
00:59:35.399 --> 00:59:38.560
uh North Africans uh had, uh the Romans had

1024
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.870
been fighting a war against uh the North African

1025
00:59:41.879 --> 00:59:44.409
uh Christians and said, you have to give us

1026
00:59:44.419 --> 00:59:46.949
your sacred books to destroy them, uh, most of

1027
00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:50.340
the people didn't, uh, uh, a few people did,

1028
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:54.290
uh, Augustine, uh, became sort of the, uh, uh,

1029
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:58.229
the pet, uh, uh, client, uh, of Rome. And,

1030
00:59:58.239 --> 01:00:00.830
uh, he, uh, called the Roman troops in, uh,

1031
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.800
you've got to kill all the Christians, uh, all

1032
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.290
of the original Christians. The ones who wouldn't give

1033
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.379
you their books, the ones who really wanted the

1034
01:00:08.389 --> 01:00:11.929
early Christianity, uh, don't, don't let them have any

1035
01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:14.520
of the churches, give us, uh give my group,

1036
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.110
their churches. Uh And uh he uh one of

1037
01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.100
the great scholars of this period. Uh Brown uh

1038
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:26.639
has uh written was called uh Constantine uh uh

1039
01:00:26.649 --> 01:00:30.500
Saint Augustine. Uh THE f really the, the first

1040
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.969
founder of the spirit of the inquisition. Uh And

1041
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.050
uh uh uh Augustine had a problem. What are

1042
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.510
we going to do with the world? With the

1043
01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.370
Lord's prayer? We can't have forgive them their debts

1044
01:00:42.379 --> 01:00:46.310
because the, that the Roman society is all based

1045
01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.639
upon predators. So, uh I didn't say, well, he

1046
01:00:49.649 --> 01:00:52.520
really didn't say that what he said was forgive

1047
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:55.110
them their sins. Well, the word for debt and

1048
01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.409
sin uh were the same in almost every language

1049
01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:02.280
uh in German, uh for instance, devoir uh in

1050
01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:06.586
French and even in, in Babylon. And you remember

1051
01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.697
at the beginning of our talk, I talked about

1052
01:01:09.106 --> 01:01:11.596
veld fines. Uh YOU would uh if you injured

1053
01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:15.237
somebody, you had to pay a fine. Uh And

1054
01:01:15.247 --> 01:01:18.156
that was told that uh the SD uh the

1055
01:01:18.166 --> 01:01:21.047
debt uh the Schult meant, ok, I've done an

1056
01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:23.636
offense. They uh they didn't really call it sin

1057
01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:26.116
in the Christian sense. It, it was an offense

1058
01:01:26.126 --> 01:01:29.626
and this money that I'm paying you is to

1059
01:01:29.636 --> 01:01:32.937
uh heal the offense to sort of cancel it

1060
01:01:32.947 --> 01:01:35.533
out. So the payment uh in the sin, they

1061
01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:37.843
use the same word for it. Uh We know

1062
01:01:37.854 --> 01:01:41.444
from the Greek translation of the Bible that indeed

1063
01:01:41.503 --> 01:01:44.604
uh Jesus is talking about canceling the Debs and

1064
01:01:44.614 --> 01:01:47.983
we know from all the other uh Jewish documentation

1065
01:01:47.993 --> 01:01:50.283
in the Dead Sea girls that uh they were

1066
01:01:50.293 --> 01:01:53.823
canceling uh the Debs. Uh But Augustine said no

1067
01:01:53.894 --> 01:01:57.924
uh there, it's really sin and sin is inborn

1068
01:01:57.934 --> 01:02:01.023
uh from we're all sinners because we've inherited it

1069
01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:04.430
from Adam. He, he rewrote all of Christianity as

1070
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.601
they were all sin, sinful. Uh And you can

1071
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:10.170
only get over it by giving your money to

1072
01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.450
the church. Uh And this ended up with uh

1073
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.500
uh the, the sale of indulgences which finally led

1074
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.861
to uh Martin Luther to break away after 1515

1075
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:24.520
in Europe. Uh But the idea that uh he

1076
01:02:24.531 --> 01:02:27.561
said uh we in Rome, we're the pathway to

1077
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:30.531
heaven. We decide who goes to heaven. It's gonna

1078
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.909
cost you money. Uh And if you give it

1079
01:02:32.919 --> 01:02:35.669
to, to us uh and then uh then it's,

1080
01:02:35.679 --> 01:02:38.550
it's OK. We can heal because we are the

1081
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.600
heirs of Christ and Christ is all about money.

1082
01:02:41.699 --> 01:02:45.159
Uh, AND, and, uh, you're all about sin. Well,

1083
01:02:45.169 --> 01:02:47.300
there was a little bit of a fight within

1084
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:51.189
the, uh, uh, uh, the Christian church and, uh,

1085
01:02:51.909 --> 01:02:54.929
you had, uh, either a Welsh or, uh, uh,

1086
01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:58.959
other, uh, British, uh, uh, theologian saying, wait a

1087
01:02:58.969 --> 01:03:02.169
minute if you do good works, uh, uh, you

1088
01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:05.100
can, uh, be a moral person and go to

1089
01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.620
heaven. You don't have to say you're still, uh,

1090
01:03:07.629 --> 01:03:09.979
a sinner no matter what, you don't have to

1091
01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:11.969
give the money to the church. You can give

1092
01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:13.989
it to the community. You can build it up

1093
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.379
with good works. No, no, have to be to

1094
01:03:16.389 --> 01:03:19.010
the church. I gotta get it. Uh I mean,

1095
01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.780
this was a totally evil person. And if you

1096
01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:26.090
read his autobiography, it's all about sexual sin and

1097
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.600
uh obsession with uh with a sin of a

1098
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:32.110
sexual form. It's just uh uh it, it, it

1099
01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.899
got perverted. Uh Fortunately, there was the real Christianity

1100
01:03:37.909 --> 01:03:40.850
uh such as uh such as survived. And that

1101
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.310
was in Constantinople and there were five patriarchates of

1102
01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.100
the Christian church. Constantinople was the main one. There

1103
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:54.120
was Alexandria. Uh And there was Antioch uh also

1104
01:03:54.129 --> 01:03:58.699
uh so uh not that Nole Jerusalem Antioch. Uh

1105
01:03:58.979 --> 01:04:05.159
And why am I blocking out uh Alex? And

1106
01:04:05.699 --> 01:04:08.010
I'm, I'm just blocking out the uh the other

1107
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.830
one. And uh but Rome was uh the least

1108
01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.570
uh important Roman sort of got depopulated. And uh

1109
01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:19.149
by the 10th century 11th century. You had the

1110
01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:22.479
local Roman families. Uh, BASICALLY the, uh, the local

1111
01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:25.830
families all throughout, uh, the West would control, uh,

1112
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.840
the, the local mayor, the local police force. They'd

1113
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.370
also, uh, appoint members of the church and the,

1114
01:04:31.379 --> 01:04:34.610
uh, the leading family. Uh, uh, THERE was AAA

1115
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.169
suburb of Rome Tusculum. And, uh, you had the,

1116
01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:42.110
uh, uh, the, uh, Tusculum Popes, uh, for, uh,

1117
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.899
uh, ruling throughout almost the entire 10th century. And

1118
01:04:46.909 --> 01:04:50.830
uh the Catholic church itself calls this the pornography,

1119
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.989
the rule of the uh the harlots. Um And

1120
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.330
uh you know, a completely decadent flat. So anyway,

1121
01:04:58.389 --> 01:05:01.149
that's what, that's what uh the result of uh

1122
01:05:01.159 --> 01:05:03.110
uh all of this was. And the West fellow

1123
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.409
fell into kind of uh uh just uh a,

1124
01:05:06.419 --> 01:05:11.209
a backwater. Uh And uh you had in the

1125
01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:19.860
uh again, constantinople, uh you had uh debt problems

1126
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:23.159
sometimes developing, especially if there was a very bad

1127
01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:27.060
winter. Uh And the crops failed. The uh the

1128
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.530
emperor would uh try to cancel the debts and

1129
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.580
the emperor did everything it could to do what

1130
01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:37.860
the Babylonian rulers did to prevent a domestic oligarchy

1131
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:40.760
from developing. Because if it did uh the, the,

1132
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.969
the wealthy families of the Byzantine Empire, uh tried

1133
01:05:44.979 --> 01:05:47.639
to get uh get labor uh get their own

1134
01:05:47.649 --> 01:05:51.139
armies and they tried to uh attack uh uh

1135
01:05:51.149 --> 01:05:54.780
the emperor in constantinople to take it over saying

1136
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.270
uh we, we, we want to run the empire,

1137
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.320
not having an empire. We want to do what

1138
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.010
the Romans did have the wealthy families take over.

1139
01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:07.310
They were defeated and uh uh in uh forgiven

1140
01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.080
their deaths. I, I sort of, uh, I have

1141
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:14.310
the last chapter on constantinople. And uh finally, uh

1142
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.370
the uh uh the emperor defeated the general. Uh

1143
01:06:18.379 --> 01:06:21.979
I invited him to a, a dinner then said,

1144
01:06:21.989 --> 01:06:24.810
you know, you don't have peace. And the emperor

1145
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.770
asked the general, you know, how can we uh

1146
01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.169
prevent this kind of uh oligarchy uh taking over?

1147
01:06:33.179 --> 01:06:35.820
Uh uh YOU know, fighting men, keep trying to

1148
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.629
take uh get the population in debt and fight

1149
01:06:38.639 --> 01:06:41.149
me. And the general said, well, you may be

1150
01:06:41.159 --> 01:06:43.560
surprised to hear a general say this, but you,

1151
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:46.252
you've got to prevent the oligarchy from getting rich.

1152
01:06:46.272 --> 01:06:48.113
Uh You've got to keep them in check, uh

1153
01:06:48.123 --> 01:06:50.873
tax them. Uh MA make sure they don't have

1154
01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:53.482
enough money to uh to do uh what they've

1155
01:06:53.492 --> 01:06:57.653
just done uh again. And uh that's uh exactly.

1156
01:06:57.663 --> 01:07:00.782
Uh BUT uh one of the tyrants na namely

1157
01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:03.492
the, the, the good guys in uh the eight,

1158
01:07:03.502 --> 01:07:07.305
seventh and sixth century BC in Greece, uh had

1159
01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:10.035
said uh uh to uh one of the rulers,

1160
01:07:10.045 --> 01:07:13.275
uh he took the ruler to uh the ruler

1161
01:07:13.285 --> 01:07:15.456
said to him. Uh YOU know, what, what should

1162
01:07:15.466 --> 01:07:19.055
I do to prevent uh uh another group of

1163
01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:22.895
these mafiosi uh oligarchs taking and uh the uh

1164
01:07:23.176 --> 01:07:28.256
the philosopher uh trusted uh uh took a side

1165
01:07:28.355 --> 01:07:32.290
and uh, uh, cut all of the grain so

1166
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.750
that it was all sort of equal and, uh

1167
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.080
in other words, make them equal. You don't want

1168
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.399
the tall green to end up dominating the others.

1169
01:07:41.409 --> 01:07:44.250
Well, uh, that was the spirit of Christian of

1170
01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.330
the real Christianity in Eastern Christianity. Uh, AND, uh,

1171
01:07:48.489 --> 01:07:52.719
as it turned, the, the 11th to 13th century,

1172
01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:57.590
saw Rome try to conquer, uh, uh, uh Eastern

1173
01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.560
Christianity and, uh, all in the middle of the

1174
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:04.229
11th century, uh they, you had the great schism

1175
01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:07.850
of uh the West saying we reject everything that

1176
01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.669
uh uh is uh eastern because that was Christian.

1177
01:08:11.679 --> 01:08:13.810
Uh We've got to have our own religion. They

1178
01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.520
also called it Christianity. Uh And uh then you

1179
01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:21.410
had the crusades essentially that were fought mainly against,

1180
01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:26.169
almost entirely against other Christian countries. So I, I

1181
01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.169
guess I gave you a long uh dynamic.

1182
01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:33.020
No, no, but that was all very interesting to,

1183
01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:36.509
to learn. So, uh for the last part of

1184
01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.979
our conversation today, I would like to ask you

1185
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:44.779
more about our contemporary societies. I mean, referring to

1186
01:08:44.879 --> 01:08:48.938
the collapse of antiquity again, uh what can we

1187
01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:53.758
learn from how things played out in ancient Greece

1188
01:08:53.769 --> 01:08:58.849
and Rome that would apply to our uh current

1189
01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:00.139
uh context.

1190
01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:05.108
Well, the Greeks uh uh had uh a much

1191
01:09:05.118 --> 01:09:09.068
more sophisticated uh economics than you had today. Uh

1192
01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:13.269
NOT as sophisticated as the Babylonians. The Babylonians actually

1193
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:16.328
had a great economic model that's far in advance

1194
01:09:16.337 --> 01:09:19.389
of any mathematical model uh that they use today.

1195
01:09:19.499 --> 01:09:22.519
Their model was quite simple. They had uh on

1196
01:09:22.528 --> 01:09:26.519
the one hand, the exponential growth of debt doubling,

1197
01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:29.269
every kind of debt is a doubling time and

1198
01:09:29.278 --> 01:09:32.758
it grows exponentially, we have the textbooks that they

1199
01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.538
taught the uh uh the students. So we know

1200
01:09:35.548 --> 01:09:38.707
exactly what they were taught. They, they also, we

1201
01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:41.837
have the uh calculations for how much does a

1202
01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:45.438
herd, uh a herd grow. It's an s curve,

1203
01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:49.890
it, it uh tapers off. Uh And so if

1204
01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.720
you have an S curve tapering off and the

1205
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.729
debts going up like this, you have the debts,

1206
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:59.560
it exceeding the ability to pay by a widening

1207
01:09:59.569 --> 01:10:02.569
amount. And either you cancel the debts or else

1208
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.910
you stifle the economy and debt deflation. Uh You

1209
01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:07.990
should have a model for that today. That's just

1210
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.020
what's happening today. But uh today you have uh

1211
01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.270
since the creditors uh run the economics department, they

1212
01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:19.839
say everything's equilibrium. Don't worry everything's going to automatically

1213
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.209
balance uh in the, the free market uh market

1214
01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.140
without government. You don't need government. Well, any anyway,

1215
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.640
the, the Greeks, uh the the Greeks uh uh

1216
01:10:29.649 --> 01:10:33.453
said the big problem in society was money lust.

1217
01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:36.303
Once you uh that uh having wealth is not

1218
01:10:36.312 --> 01:10:39.703
like having bananas. Uh uh When I took uh

1219
01:10:39.792 --> 01:10:43.853
uh an econo economics phd, we were told that

1220
01:10:43.862 --> 01:10:48.112
diminishing marginal utility and uh the first banana you

1221
01:10:48.123 --> 01:10:50.933
like each added banana gets less and less until

1222
01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.933
finally you don't want any more. Uh, AND you're

1223
01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:56.632
satiated and so you're going to leave the crop

1224
01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:59.033
free for other people that don't have bananas and

1225
01:10:59.042 --> 01:11:02.045
they're want bananas more. Uh, AND, uh, you're gonna

1226
01:11:02.056 --> 01:11:05.516
be satiated and everything and that way everybody's going

1227
01:11:05.525 --> 01:11:07.585
to end up with their chance to get rich.

1228
01:11:07.616 --> 01:11:09.655
Well, the Greek said it doesn't work that, uh,

1229
01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:12.755
for wealth that it may work that way for,

1230
01:11:12.766 --> 01:11:16.905
uh, food, but it, uh, uh wealth is addictive

1231
01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:19.355
and they had, uh all sorts of Greek words

1232
01:11:19.366 --> 01:11:23.686
for that, like money, love, uh, wealth, addiction. Uh

1233
01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:27.520
And that was the problem. And, uh, uh all

1234
01:11:27.529 --> 01:11:31.810
of Plato's Republic uh is, uh about that, uh,

1235
01:11:31.819 --> 01:11:37.129
it begins with, uh Socrates, someone asking Socrates, uh

1236
01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:40.450
uh II, I owe some money, you know, I

1237
01:11:40.459 --> 01:11:43.669
really, it's hard to repay this. Predator is such

1238
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.549
a bastard, you know, is it right that I

1239
01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.930
repay him? And Socrates said, well, suppose that, uh,

1240
01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:53.160
you'd, uh borrowed a weapon from somebody, you needed

1241
01:11:53.169 --> 01:11:55.399
a sword, uh, to fight in the army. And

1242
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.660
now, uh, then you find out that this guy

1243
01:11:57.669 --> 01:12:00.220
is a real sadist. Uh, AND he wants to

1244
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:02.620
hurt people with a weapon. Is it the right

1245
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:06.529
thing to do to give, uh back the weapon

1246
01:12:06.799 --> 01:12:09.000
uh, to him because he's gonna use it to

1247
01:12:09.009 --> 01:12:13.669
hurt people. And, uh, uh, the, uh, the person

1248
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.600
says, gee, I guess you're right. Socrates says, well,

1249
01:12:16.609 --> 01:12:19.479
it's the same thing, uh, with money, uh, if

1250
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.779
you give money back to a creditor, the more

1251
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:24.720
money he has he's going to get more and

1252
01:12:24.729 --> 01:12:28.310
more, uh, uh, debt addicted and, uh, he's going

1253
01:12:28.319 --> 01:12:30.299
to just try to run, uh, he's not going

1254
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:32.640
to look for the public good anymore. He's going

1255
01:12:32.649 --> 01:12:35.120
to do what's good for himself. Well, we had

1256
01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:38.250
to study this at the University Chicago and, uh,

1257
01:12:38.259 --> 01:12:40.700
just as they, uh, tried to say, uh, uh,

1258
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:44.740
the education, there was, uh, just an exercise in

1259
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:48.410
censorship there. Uh, uh, WHAT we were told there

1260
01:12:48.419 --> 01:12:52.450
was, uh, the Republics all about, uh, the, uh,

1261
01:12:52.459 --> 01:12:56.879
the noble dictator, uh, the, the, uh, the, uh,

1262
01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.279
the, the smart guy who's running everything and, uh,

1263
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:05.549
you really want, uh, uh AAA noble uh, dictator.

1264
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.310
Uh, AND that's not what Socrates said at all.

1265
01:13:08.549 --> 01:13:10.370
What he said is, you know, how do you

1266
01:13:10.379 --> 01:13:14.700
prevent, uh, a wealthy person from taking over society?

1267
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:17.049
He said, well, right now, uh, it's always the

1268
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.859
wealthiest person or somebody from one of the wealthy

1269
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:22.640
families that's going to end up, uh, as a

1270
01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:26.609
leader. Uh, I, if you want to avoid society,

1271
01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:30.169
being run by a wealth addicted class, you have

1272
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.330
to have, uh, the, uh, uh, the dictator or,

1273
01:13:34.339 --> 01:13:36.750
you know, whatever you call them, uh, not have

1274
01:13:36.759 --> 01:13:39.620
property of his own, not to have money of

1275
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:41.759
his own. You're gonna make sure that he lives

1276
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:44.660
nicely. You're gonna feed him, you're gonna support him.

1277
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:47.279
Uh, HE'S gonna be just a regular, he's gonna

1278
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:51.180
have what the regular citizen, uh, citizen, uh, has.

1279
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:53.379
But he's, uh, he's not going to have enough

1280
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:56.310
wealth that he gets, gets addicted to it and,

1281
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:59.080
uh, does to us what, uh, the wealthy class

1282
01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:02.589
is threatening to do. Uh, TODAY. Well, Socrates, uh,

1283
01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:07.069
most of his, uh, clients, uh, at, uh, the

1284
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.799
academy were, uh, uh, the wealthy classes they meet

1285
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:15.729
in gymnasiums. The word for school was uh in,

1286
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.890
in your, in German language and of the European

1287
01:14:18.899 --> 01:14:21.589
language with gymnasium. And it meant that that was

1288
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.439
where the wealthy people would gather uh both to

1289
01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:27.490
work out and exercise, but also to have their

1290
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.339
uh political talks. Uh And uh so that Socrates

1291
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:34.209
was, was trying to explain to them. Well, you

1292
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.729
know, uh you guys are really all sort of

1293
01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.689
uh uh well addicted. And uh anyway, he, he

1294
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.250
ended up being put to death to make a

1295
01:14:43.259 --> 01:14:46.529
long story short just and of course, uh the

1296
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.049
universe that was the one thing that the University

1297
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.290
of Chicago picked up from when they uh when

1298
01:14:52.299 --> 01:14:56.640
Chileans uh uh elected a uh socialist president uh

1299
01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.600
uh the Chicago, the Chicago school uh was brilliant

1300
01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:04.515
enough to say there's only one way to create

1301
01:15:04.524 --> 01:15:08.064
a free market. You have to kill everybody who

1302
01:15:08.075 --> 01:15:11.044
critic who says that there is an alternative. They

1303
01:15:11.055 --> 01:15:16.475
close, the Chicago boys closed every university economics Department

1304
01:15:16.484 --> 01:15:20.725
in Chile, except for the Catholic University. Uh THAT

1305
01:15:20.734 --> 01:15:25.084
taught uh uh Chicago school, uh free market, meaning

1306
01:15:25.095 --> 01:15:29.509
dictatorship, uh e economics. And uh they set a

1307
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.919
whole terrorism campaign to kill labor union leaders to

1308
01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:37.870
kill uh university progressive professors uh to kill land

1309
01:15:37.879 --> 01:15:41.220
reformers. Uh NOT only in Chile, but all throughout

1310
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:44.779
Latin America to Argentina. Uh THE death squads. Uh

1311
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:49.240
YOU can't have a uh free market limiting government

1312
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:52.765
if you don't have death squads uh doing just

1313
01:15:52.774 --> 01:15:55.274
what they did in Rome to kill all of

1314
01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:59.055
the opposition. Because once you have people understand that

1315
01:15:59.064 --> 01:16:01.444
they, uh didn't as they did in Rome. If

1316
01:16:01.455 --> 01:16:05.774
Jesus was saying, uh uh once they know there's

1317
01:16:05.785 --> 01:16:09.145
an alternative, uh then people are going to want

1318
01:16:09.154 --> 01:16:12.234
the alternative and there's going to be a revolution.

1319
01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.779
And, uh the idea of today's neo liberal history,

1320
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:20.259
they, they've rewritten uh history when, when, uh I,

1321
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:25.970
my, my Harvard group, uh from 1992 to about

1322
01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:32.520
2010, published fi uh five, colloquial rewriting the economic

1323
01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:36.600
history of the ancient, uh near East. And, uh

1324
01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:40.790
uh now all of uh the serios all uh

1325
01:16:40.799 --> 01:16:44.279
uh accept all of this. And when we begin,

1326
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:48.529
almost all of the uh uh uh economic history

1327
01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:52.009
of uh this early period was written by economists,

1328
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:56.370
not by a Serio, not by anthropologists by economists.

1329
01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:59.229
And they said, well, it's impossible for, uh, the

1330
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.450
there to have canceled the debts if you did,

1331
01:17:01.459 --> 01:17:04.140
who is going to lend money anymore. They didn't

1332
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:08.220
realize that most debts weren't lending money. They were

1333
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:11.120
accrued debts when you couldn't pay because the harvest

1334
01:17:11.129 --> 01:17:14.479
failed or you just couldn't, uh, couldn't keep up

1335
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:17.970
with your, your, your payments. Uh It's, uh they

1336
01:17:17.979 --> 01:17:21.200
believed that uh there, uh there couldn't be no

1337
01:17:21.209 --> 01:17:24.000
economy could get rich the way the near eastern

1338
01:17:24.009 --> 01:17:27.500
economy he did by canceling the debts because that

1339
01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:30.180
was a strong government and you really need uh

1340
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:34.580
a free market without any government interference, like canceling

1341
01:17:34.589 --> 01:17:38.569
the debts, redistributing the land. And if Milton Friedman

1342
01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.919
say in a modern economist, one of the students

1343
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.799
would get into a time machine and go back

1344
01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:48.209
to uh 2000 BC and Babylonia or 2500 BC

1345
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.350
and Sumer and advise uh the rule, the rulers

1346
01:17:51.359 --> 01:17:53.060
saying, you know, we're here from the future to

1347
01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.240
help you. Uh Let, let me tell you how

1348
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:58.140
to organize the society, you know, free market. Let

1349
01:17:58.149 --> 01:18:01.879
every let take that take its course. Uh Don't

1350
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.839
cancel them, don't interfere with the economy. There never

1351
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:08.879
would have been civilization. Uh And uh and the

1352
01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:11.109
question now is well, OK. Now, no, not only

1353
01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.700
would there never have been civilization but if the

1354
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:18.279
Chicago boys, the neoliberals uh and the Washington consensus

1355
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:20.279
has its way today. Are, are we going to

1356
01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:22.850
have the end of civilization or at least Western

1357
01:18:22.859 --> 01:18:27.370
civilization while the global majority goes its way? Well,

1358
01:18:27.379 --> 01:18:30.160
there again, I began to diverge uh

1359
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:34.399
related to debt. Let me ask you this question,

1360
01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:39.140
what about debt that countries owe each other? Could

1361
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:41.959
that kind of debt also be canceled?

1362
01:18:42.379 --> 01:18:46.069
Wait, what kind of debt will be canceled? Uh

1363
01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.640
DEBT that countries owe each other?

1364
01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:54.330
Well, uh you already had that occur in 1931.

1365
01:18:54.509 --> 01:18:59.490
Uh uh AFTER World War two, the uh uh

1366
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.640
United States insisted that uh the allies pay uh

1367
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:06.830
for all of the US arms exports that they'd

1368
01:19:06.839 --> 01:19:11.080
made uh before uh uh America entered World War

1369
01:19:11.089 --> 01:19:13.540
one. And so the ally said, OK, if we

1370
01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:15.439
have to pay America, we have to get the

1371
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:19.220
money from Germany and uh they imposed uh reparations

1372
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:21.750
on Germany. Uh This is the story that I've

1373
01:19:21.759 --> 01:19:25.799
talked uh described in my book, Super Imperialism. And

1374
01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:28.459
uh so the result is that this debt tangle

1375
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:32.240
ended up uh causing uh a whole breakdown, the

1376
01:19:32.250 --> 01:19:36.120
stock market crashed in 1929. Uh The economy began

1377
01:19:36.129 --> 01:19:40.060
to move into the Great Depression by 1931. Uh

1378
01:19:40.069 --> 01:19:43.569
THE uh all the governments of the creditor and

1379
01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.600
debtor countries got together and said, OK, uh we're

1380
01:19:46.609 --> 01:19:50.384
uh it's not worth creating a whole depression throughout

1381
01:19:50.395 --> 01:19:53.415
the world, the western world. Uh JUST uh uh

1382
01:19:53.424 --> 01:19:56.654
to uh uh pay the uh uh uh the

1383
01:19:56.665 --> 01:19:59.365
war debts left over from World War one. We're

1384
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:02.535
gonna have uh a moratorium on uh the war

1385
01:20:02.544 --> 01:20:05.694
debts. Well, by that time, it was uh already

1386
01:20:05.705 --> 01:20:10.290
uh too late to have uh uh uh uh

1387
01:20:10.299 --> 01:20:14.649
to prevent the, uh, depression from developing and, uh,

1388
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:18.120
the world, uh emerged in World war two, pretty

1389
01:20:18.129 --> 01:20:22.250
much, uh, without debt. Uh, AND the German economic

1390
01:20:22.259 --> 01:20:26.470
miracle in uh 1947 was when they canceled all

1391
01:20:26.479 --> 01:20:29.430
of the internal German debts. Well, that was pretty

1392
01:20:29.439 --> 01:20:32.649
easy. Uh, BECAUSE the debts were all owed to

1393
01:20:32.759 --> 01:20:35.812
people who'd been Nazis. Uh, THE rich people had

1394
01:20:35.823 --> 01:20:38.252
got their wealth during the Nazi era. So you

1395
01:20:38.263 --> 01:20:40.823
were really canceling the debts to the Nazis that

1396
01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:44.022
became uh the uh the, the only debts that

1397
01:20:44.033 --> 01:20:47.482
were kept were employer debts to their employees. And

1398
01:20:47.493 --> 01:20:50.232
everybody was allowed to keep, uh you know, uh

1399
01:20:50.243 --> 01:20:52.942
a modicum of uh a bank accounts just so

1400
01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:55.362
that they could continue to do business and start

1401
01:20:55.373 --> 01:20:58.723
again. So, uh uh you had uh the allies

1402
01:20:58.732 --> 01:21:01.783
uh cancel uh the German debts and then again,

1403
01:21:01.803 --> 01:21:03.596
uh had the debts begin to mount up from

1404
01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:09.715
1945 by 1980 already. It was obvious that the

1405
01:21:09.726 --> 01:21:12.576
uh the debts couldn't be paid. Uh I, I

1406
01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:15.186
wrote a number of reports for unit tar, the

1407
01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:18.315
United Nations Institute for training and research showing that

1408
01:21:18.485 --> 01:21:21.335
uh the debts, uh the Global South debts couldn't

1409
01:21:21.346 --> 01:21:25.835
be paid. And uh indeed, in 1982 Mexico defaulted

1410
01:21:25.846 --> 01:21:28.559
and then uh one ne Latin American country after

1411
01:21:28.568 --> 01:21:31.729
another defaulted. So under the Brady Plan, the debts

1412
01:21:31.738 --> 01:21:33.958
were written down quite a bit. So of course,

1413
01:21:33.969 --> 01:21:36.289
the debts can be written down and right now

1414
01:21:36.298 --> 01:21:39.909
we're in a situation again, uh, because of the,

1415
01:21:39.918 --> 01:21:44.668
uh, America's war, uh, NATO uh war against Russia

1416
01:21:44.679 --> 01:21:48.798
and China and Iran. Uh, YOU have uh oil

1417
01:21:48.809 --> 01:21:52.548
prices going way up, uh, interest rights, uh, going

1418
01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:54.821
way up and you have the global South and

1419
01:21:54.832 --> 01:21:58.551
many uh uh East Asian countries unable and African

1420
01:21:58.562 --> 01:22:02.341
countries uh unable to pay uh, their foreign debt.

1421
01:22:02.381 --> 01:22:06.171
Uh, SO, uh, the, at least this time they

1422
01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:09.492
don't have to let the West cancel the debts.

1423
01:22:09.501 --> 01:22:12.332
They can all, they're joining together uh in the

1424
01:22:12.341 --> 01:22:15.461
BRICS plus, uh and the whole group uh ar

1425
01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:19.062
around them about the global majority uh creating an

1426
01:22:19.071 --> 01:22:24.145
alternative set of ins, they're deol, their economies, but

1427
01:22:24.154 --> 01:22:27.044
DEOL means uh we're getting rid not only of

1428
01:22:27.055 --> 01:22:29.854
the dollar but we're of the dollar debts we

1429
01:22:29.865 --> 01:22:33.015
have. And uh we're moving towards the point where

1430
01:22:33.024 --> 01:22:36.384
there will be an alternative uh to uh the

1431
01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:39.725
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Uh And

1432
01:22:39.734 --> 01:22:42.854
uh these countries by joining together can uh just

1433
01:22:42.865 --> 01:22:45.475
repudiate uh the dollar debts and a great debt

1434
01:22:45.484 --> 01:22:49.805
cancellation. Uh So yes, of course, countries can join

1435
01:22:49.814 --> 01:22:50.214
together.

1436
01:22:51.069 --> 01:22:54.359
So let me just ask you one last question

1437
01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:58.950
then. And uh in regards to what you describe

1438
01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:02.580
the story, the history you explore in the collapse

1439
01:23:02.589 --> 01:23:08.930
of antiquity, do you see signs of similar social,

1440
01:23:08.939 --> 01:23:15.279
political and economic developments happening right now in, particularly

1441
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:18.709
in the West or what some, sometimes people call

1442
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.970
the global north at least?

1443
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:24.109
Well, it, it's become more and more obvious that

1444
01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.959
if you, uh if you don't cancel the predatory

1445
01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:31.390
debts, you're going to have debt austerity already in

1446
01:23:31.399 --> 01:23:35.410
the thirties. The idea of debt deflation uh was

1447
01:23:35.419 --> 01:23:38.359
uh voiced and we're in debt deflation again, more

1448
01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:41.390
and more of the income of the United States

1449
01:23:41.399 --> 01:23:44.850
and Europe uh is paid uh to creditors. Uh

1450
01:23:44.859 --> 01:23:49.524
AND uh predators have promoted, they've uh taken over

1451
01:23:49.535 --> 01:23:52.895
the real estate sector, the insurance sector, you have

1452
01:23:52.904 --> 01:23:55.924
really uh what I call the fire sector, finance

1453
01:23:55.935 --> 01:23:59.325
insurance and real estate are a rat a sector.

1454
01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:02.884
You have a rat, a class, including the monopolies

1455
01:24:02.895 --> 01:24:09.584
now that uh are uh all uh getting predatory

1456
01:24:09.595 --> 01:24:13.240
uh income in the uh in the west. This

1457
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:17.350
uh that we're moving into uh what uh some

1458
01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:20.379
people are calling neo feudalism uh because they, they

1459
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:22.459
can see that. Well, we're moving back into this

1460
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.890
kind of polarized economy. Uh And if you don't

1461
01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:31.979
uh uh uh prevent a financial oligarchy from emerging

1462
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:36.855
and taking over, then uh it's, you, you, you're

1463
01:24:36.866 --> 01:24:39.476
going to have that happened here to what happened.

1464
01:24:39.485 --> 01:24:41.016
Uh IN Rome, you're going to have a uh

1465
01:24:41.025 --> 01:24:43.596
a dark age when all the money is at

1466
01:24:43.605 --> 01:24:45.576
the very top of the pyramid. And you've killed

1467
01:24:45.585 --> 01:24:48.476
the domestic market, you've killed growth and uh you

1468
01:24:48.485 --> 01:24:51.576
have the population fleeing and in the Roman Empire,

1469
01:24:51.585 --> 01:24:54.386
more and more of the uh at the periphery,

1470
01:24:54.395 --> 01:24:57.746
more and more Romans were joining the barbarians. Because

1471
01:24:57.766 --> 01:25:00.091
it was the ro they were barbarians and the

1472
01:25:00.102 --> 01:25:03.231
barbarians were c more civilized. They were the German

1473
01:25:03.242 --> 01:25:06.742
tribes that were very egalitarian. They were the Germanic

1474
01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:09.812
tribes. You had a whole uh uh a whole

1475
01:25:09.821 --> 01:25:13.492
different ethic than the decadent uh Ro Roman uh

1476
01:25:13.501 --> 01:25:16.571
ethic. Well, you're having that same split today uh

1477
01:25:16.582 --> 01:25:21.972
between the, uh what uh uh the uh European

1478
01:25:22.279 --> 01:25:26.310
uh union had Joseph Burrell pos uh the uh

1479
01:25:26.319 --> 01:25:30.459
European Garden as opposed to the jungle everywhere out

1480
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:34.700
there, the jungle is uh uh really democracy. Uh

1481
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:38.740
The European Garden is autocracy. But the uh the

1482
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:41.580
Americans say that the autocracy is the demo uh

1483
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.785
democracy. Is anyone who supports the American autocracy and

1484
01:25:45.794 --> 01:25:49.714
autocracy. Is anyone uh who, who uh uh government

1485
01:25:49.725 --> 01:25:52.595
uh that plays a role in moderating and preventing

1486
01:25:52.604 --> 01:25:55.944
an oligarchy from developing uh and being what uh

1487
01:25:55.964 --> 01:25:59.274
uh the spirit of democracy is supposed to be

1488
01:25:59.285 --> 01:26:02.055
all about. So we're in a kind of world

1489
01:26:02.064 --> 01:26:05.305
of or will and uh uh double think uh

1490
01:26:05.314 --> 01:26:09.080
uh today. But uh yes, uh uh uh uh

1491
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:14.859
uh the, the way to uh uh promote this

1492
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:18.970
uh it takes a revolution. And uh the uh

1493
01:26:18.979 --> 01:26:21.959
e economic, the role of the economic uh uh

1494
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.939
uh uh profession is to say there's no alternative.

1495
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:29.899
We're in uh the end of history. End of

1496
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:33.990
history is a uh by Darwinian survival. We have

1497
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.916
uh the wealthy uh frontiers uh Wall Street City

1498
01:26:37.925 --> 01:26:42.536
of England, the Paris tours uh Frankfurt, uh, uh

1499
01:26:42.545 --> 01:26:45.655
Bank of Tokyo. Um We, this is, uh really

1500
01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:48.266
the, uh, the apex of history we've won by

1501
01:26:48.275 --> 01:26:51.136
the survival of the fittest. Uh, AND, uh, uh,

1502
01:26:51.145 --> 01:26:54.855
uh, we don't have to go anymore. And so

1503
01:26:54.866 --> 01:26:57.355
there are no alternative. Well, you have the whole

1504
01:26:57.366 --> 01:26:59.655
rest of the world now. Uh, THANKS to the,

1505
01:26:59.666 --> 01:27:02.981
uh, America, uh, the NATO war against Russia and

1506
01:27:02.992 --> 01:27:06.551
Ukraine and now, uh, the near Eastern Mass, uh,

1507
01:27:06.562 --> 01:27:09.551
you have uh uh the whole world saying uh

1508
01:27:09.562 --> 01:27:12.961
this is wrong, morally wrong. And we're gonna make

1509
01:27:12.972 --> 01:27:15.412
a new uh society. And that is the, the,

1510
01:27:15.421 --> 01:27:19.102
the, the feeling that uh there is uh something

1511
01:27:19.111 --> 01:27:22.562
morally wrong. You realize that uh what uh what

1512
01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:25.742
used to be religion in the West is economic,

1513
01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:29.828
neo liberal free markets, meaning uh free for uh

1514
01:27:29.837 --> 01:27:32.888
the oligarchy to do whatever it wants uh with

1515
01:27:32.897 --> 01:27:36.268
its riches and free from any government attempt to

1516
01:27:36.277 --> 01:27:39.587
tax or to regulate the economy, to prevent monopoly

1517
01:27:39.598 --> 01:27:43.027
rents uh to tax uh land rent. Uh AND

1518
01:27:43.038 --> 01:27:46.237
to uh make uh money and credit a public

1519
01:27:46.248 --> 01:27:49.848
function uh instead of a privatized function. So, uh

1520
01:27:49.857 --> 01:27:53.673
you're having fun finally, that uh uh awareness that

1521
01:27:53.684 --> 01:27:56.594
uh Margaret Thatcher was wrong, there is an alternative.

1522
01:27:56.764 --> 01:27:58.563
Uh And if you don't take it, you're gonna

1523
01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:01.344
end up through the west just the way England

1524
01:28:01.354 --> 01:28:04.684
ended up under Margaret Thatcher, uh and her follower

1525
01:28:04.693 --> 01:28:07.363
Tony Blair that uh tried to go even further

1526
01:28:07.374 --> 01:28:10.583
further than Thatcher did in uh uh privatizing uh

1527
01:28:10.594 --> 01:28:15.083
transportation and uh uh basically destroying the British economy.

1528
01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:20.120
So, uh I'm leaving links to your books in

1529
01:28:20.129 --> 01:28:23.069
the description box of the interview, Doctor Hudson. Would

1530
01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.799
you also just like to briefly tell people about

1531
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:30.350
what your upcoming book would be about?

1532
01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.359
Well, I just finally published all of my uh

1533
01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:38.029
academic uh art uh academic articles that I've written

1534
01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.549
um in my Harvard uh articles and others and

1535
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.310
uh uh the uh Temples of Enterprise uh where

1536
01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:49.229
I talk, I described the origin of money uh

1537
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.629
in Babylonia, the origin of interest rates, the origins

1538
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.100
of land tenure. And really the origins of the

1539
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:59.709
enterprise were organized by the temples and the palaces,

1540
01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.839
uh not by individual merchants. Uh You need a

1541
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:06.209
central organizing principle. So I published all of these,

1542
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.520
but the most accessible books are the uh clap

1543
01:29:09.529 --> 01:29:12.729
uh uh the uh collapse of Antiquity for what

1544
01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:15.319
happened in Greece and Rome and the first book

1545
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:17.799
of the series and Forgive them their debts. Where

1546
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:20.899
I talked about what uh I've described today. How

1547
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:23.870
did debts begin? How did the uh debt cancellations

1548
01:29:23.879 --> 01:29:26.620
begin? And uh uh what was Jesus really saying

1549
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:28.890
in his first sermon? And uh why did the

1550
01:29:28.899 --> 01:29:30.310
Christians hate it so much?

1551
01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:34.930
Great. So, Doctor Hudson, thank you so much again

1552
01:29:34.939 --> 01:29:38.620
for accepting the invitation. It's been an honor to

1553

1555
01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.879
Yes. Yes, I will do. That with a little

1556
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:49.120
bit of help from A I, uh, I will,

1557
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:50.899
uh, you have to look at what a I

1558
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:52.350
did. You have to go over it?

1559
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:54.970
Yes. Yes. But, but, but

1560
01:29:54.979 --> 01:29:59.560
still a human. Uh, OTHERWISE I thought of dread

1561
01:29:59.569 --> 01:30:02.069

1562
