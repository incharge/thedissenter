00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.900
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:09.430
today I'm joined by Doctor Nicola Rayani. She is

4
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.289
Professor of Evolution and Behavior at Univer at University

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.610
College London. Her research considers the evolution of cooper

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.680
operation in nature. She was elected Fellow of the

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.559
Royal Society of Biology in 2019. And we're going

8
00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.040
to talk today about her first book, The Social

9
00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:31.309
Instinct How co-operation Shaped the world. So Nicola, welcome

10
00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.000
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.849
Thanks very much for the invite. And uh yeah,

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.360
I've been looking forward to joining you.

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.889
OK, great. So let me first ask you since

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.049
this is a book basically about uh our societies

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.740
evolved about sociality. Why do you begin the book

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.740
by going all the way down to the cellular

17
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.299
level?

18
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.189
Well, I think it's kind of interesting to start

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.599
there because the book has the book has a

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.019
very obvious structure. So it starts very small, thinking

21
00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.220
about co-operation that uh happens inside the bodies of

22
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.580
multicellular organisms. And then it in each part of

23
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.339
the book, I zoom out a level and think

24
00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:18.540
about the evolution of families and then the evolution

25
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.879
of co-operation beyond the family group. And finally, in

26
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.779
the last part of the book, I talk about

27
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.639
the evolution of societies and large scale co-operation. Um

28
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.639
The reason that I wanted to have that structure

29
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.480
is that I think um for people who maybe

30
00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.879
don't know a lot about cooper operation or who

31
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.639
haven't, you know, studied it in much detail. It

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.470
would be quite easy to assume that cooper operation

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.389
was just something that happens between individuals. So it's

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.190
some kind of behavior that you see individuals doing

35
00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.730
and that's observable in some way in the real

36
00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.860
world. Uh And I don't think it's as widely

37
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.379
appreciated that actually every multicellular being on earth, every

38
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.910
living multicellular organism, whether it's a plant or an

39
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.830
animal or, or a fungi is actually created through

40
00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:20.679
co-operation and it's created through genes cooperating with one

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.229
another and cells cooperating with one another to um

42
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.889
form this collective that we call an organism or

43
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.130
an individual. And the reason that I wanted to

44
00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.729
uh have this structure and to think about this

45
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.300
sort of this, this cooper operation at these, the

46
00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.610
lowest levels if you like at the lowest levels

47
00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.350
of organization is because it helps, it helps us

48
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.649
to realize as we move through the book, these

49
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.899
very general principles that underpin co-operation at all levels

50
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.470
of life, whether we're talking about genes cooperating inside

51
00:02:55.479 --> 00:03:01.610
bodies or ants cooperating inside a a colony or

52
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.050
people cooperating inside a society. There are some kind

53
00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.990
of fundamental general principles that emerge at all these

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.229
levels of life. And that's why I wanted to

55
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.190
start with this perspective of the understanding the individual

56
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.490
as a feat of cooper operation. Um TO try

57
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.949
to bring out those commonalities and to surprise people

58
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.429
in a way,

59
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.759
right? And why do you decide to focus on

60
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.210
cooper operation? Because for example, we could also have

61
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.550
focused on competition. So why cooper?

62
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:40.669
Well, for me, co-operation and competition are two sides

63
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.050
of the same coin. Um So in, I think

64
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.990
one of the big misunderstandings in some ways about

65
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.050
the selfish gene, the book by Richard Dawkins, which

66
00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.990
is 45 years old now is that it predicts

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.100
is that selfish genes would predict selfish behavior and

68
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.270
that we would only find selfish genes inside the

69
00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:06.250
bodies of the most selfish or uh nefarious individuals.

70
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.509
And in fact that has been that is a

71
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.690
misconception and continues to be a misconception of what

72
00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.369
that gene eye's view perspective of evolution is about.

73
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750
And Dawkins himself noted in his book that in

74
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.635
many ways, the most effective ways for a gene

75
00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:26.515
to ensure that copies of itself find their way

76
00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:30.545
into future generations is to co-operate. And through this

77
00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:34.035
lens, we can see that co-operation is often a

78
00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:38.225
selfish or a self interested strategy. And so for

79
00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:43.040
me, I see focusing on co-operation is in some

80
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.709
ways, it just depends how you want to view

81
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.910
it, you can view cooper operation as being a

82
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.549
form of competition if you like, even though people

83
00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.649
don't often think of it that way. So I

84
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.510
wouldn't necessarily say that my book is only about

85
00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.390
cooper operation. It's about how cooper operation is often

86
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.690
an effective way to compete or to prosper.

87
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.279
So when trying to understand the evolution of human

88
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.450
co-operation, what would be the best uh models? I

89
00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.899
mean, in terms of other species to, to which

90
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.380
we should compare humans? I mean, would it be

91
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.079
the most closely related to us, the other great

92
00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.100
apes or others?

93
00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.160
So I think this is a really interesting question

94
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.459
and this is one, this kind of question is

95
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.769
one that's actually underwritten lots of my own academic

96
00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.559
research because many of the species that I've worked

97
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.940
on outside of my research on humans have been

98
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.679
species that not only are not very closely related

99
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.730
to us on the tree of life, but they're

100
00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:50.829
species that people probably have never even heard of.

101
00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:53.829
So things like a pied babbler, which is a

102
00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.450
bird that lives in family groups in, in the

103
00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:59.760
Kalahari desert or the cleaner fish, which is a

104
00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:02.940
fish that lives on coral reefs in the in

105
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.049
throughout the Indo Pacific. And one of the general

106
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:11.459
um underlying themes of the research that I've done

107
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.940
when I've compared the behavior of nonhuman species with

108
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.459
what we see in humans and in particular, the

109
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.820
social behavior and the co-operative behavior is that often

110
00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:26.540
we can find striking similarities in the kinds of

111
00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:31.019
behavioral outcomes that are achieved by humans and by

112
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.200
quite distantly related species like meerkats and hide babblers

113
00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:39.279
and cleaner fish. Even though we don't, we're not

114
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.839
closely related to these species. Uh And one of

115
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.769
the key points in some ways is this idea

116
00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.290
that often we might get to the same behavioral

117
00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:53.529
destination as another species. So to give an example,

118
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.010
one of the behaviors that humans are famous for

119
00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.369
is teaching and we tend to think of teaching

120
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.829
as being, you know, a quintessentially human activity. Um

121
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.589
And when we, when people started looking for examples

122
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.670
of teaching in the animal world, in the nonhuman

123
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:12.359
world, they instinctively looked for it first in species

124
00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:15.660
like chimpanzees and gorillas and the other great apes.

125
00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:18.260
But we didn't find those examples of teaching in

126
00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:21.040
those species. And in fact, the first species where

127
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:24.549
we found an example of teaching was an ant.

128
00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:27.700
And the second example was a meerkat. And so,

129
00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:29.799
and the third example actually was a work that

130
00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:32.670
I did, which was on pied babblers. One of

131
00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.679
the really interesting things. And one of the main

132
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.989
messages in my book is that often we can

133
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.649
find that humans and nonhuman species can get to

134
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.700
the same behavioral destination. So we see these commonalities,

135
00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:50.049
for example, in the fact that we teach, but

136
00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:52.170
so do meerkats and so do ants and so

137
00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:55.579
do pried babblers, but we get there via a

138
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:59.339
quite different cognitive journey to these other species. And

139
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.720
so the kind of cognition that supports teaching in

140
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.140
humans probably involves the ability to understand what a

141
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:10.519
pupil knows some kind of mind reading or what

142
00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:14.350
psychologists call theory of mind. Whereas in species like

143
00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:17.410
ants and babblers and meerkats, we don't think there's

144
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.239
that sort of cognition is happening at all to

145
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.089
facilitate teaching. And instead the teaching behavior is achieved

146
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.010
by our different cognitive route. And so I think

147
00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:33.789
often we can find similarities in the behavior we

148
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.429
observe between humans and other species in the behavioral

149
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.489
outcomes. And we ought to look for similarities and

150
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.869
behavioral outcomes where the ecology is likely to favor

151
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.659
those kinds of behaviors. And that won't always be

152
00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:50.390
in our closest living relatives that won't always be

153
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.130
in species like the chimpanzees and the other great

154
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.270
apes. But even when we do find those behavioral

155
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.909
similarities, what we then also have to ask is,

156
00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:04.169
well, how does the cognition supporting those behaviors differ?

157
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:06.130
And that's really where I think we start to

158
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.859
see points of divergence between humans and other species,

159
00:09:09.869 --> 00:09:12.340
which is not so much what we do. But

160
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:14.010
it's a, it's about how we do it and

161
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.409
it's about how we get there cognitively.

162
00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:21.770
So when talking about the evolution of co-operation, particularly

163
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.169
with evolutionary biologists, people bring to the table evolved

164
00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:31.570
mechanisms like kin selection, reciprocal altruism group selection even

165
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.929
so Uh I I mean, do you think that

166
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.789
any one of these is uh enough to explain

167
00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:43.780
the evolution of co-operation or should we unders try

168
00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:48.400
to understand different aspects of co-operation uh how they

169
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:52.909
evolve via one of these evolved mechanisms? And I

170
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:57.979
mean, particularly group selection because that's a very controversial

171
00:09:57.989 --> 00:10:01.400
topic among evolutionary biologists. I mean, what do you

172
00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:02.340
think about it?

173
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.690
So I think there is this sort of pervasive

174
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.909
assumption in a lot of the human evolution literature

175
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.530
that the two key mechanisms that support co-operation are

176
00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:18.549
either kin selection, meaning just that you help your

177
00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:21.190
relatives because you share copies of their genes. And

178
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.224
that's another way to get copies of your genes

179
00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:27.804
into the next generation or it's reciprocal altruism. And

180
00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:29.734
there is a kind of, there has been at

181
00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:31.765
least an assumption in the literature that if you

182
00:10:31.775 --> 00:10:35.034
can't explain co-operation, either with kin selection or with

183
00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:37.895
reciprocal altruism, then we should, then we should bring

184
00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:41.994
in group selection as the alternative explanation. And I

185
00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:46.265
don't, I don't fully subscribe to that view. So

186
00:10:46.275 --> 00:10:50.390
I think that kin selection is probably the most

187
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.890
important mechanism for explaining the breadth of co-operation that

188
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.599
we see on earth. So most of the co-operation

189
00:10:56.609 --> 00:11:00.520
we see in um humans but also in nonhuman

190
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.390
species occurs within the confines of family groups. And

191
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.190
there is no coincidence that we see co-operation in

192
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.049
families because there's just a much bigger incentive to

193
00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:14.820
help individuals who share copies of the, the same

194
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.640
genes that you have. And so if you were

195
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.400
going to say which which of these evolutionary mechanisms

196
00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:23.580
has the most potential for explaining most cases of

197
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.909
co-operation that we see on earth. I think in

198
00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:29.500
selection probably explains most of the examples we see

199
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.599
particularly in nonhuman species. But when we look at

200
00:11:33.979 --> 00:11:38.890
between unrelated individuals where we know that kin selection

201
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.900
can't be at work. I think it's very short

202
00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:44.950
sighted to assume that the only other mechanism at

203
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.020
our disposal to explain this co-operation is reciprocal altruism.

204
00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:52.929
And we know that there are many, many mechanisms

205
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.359
that can support co-operation between non relatives, um things

206
00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:02.190
like punishment and um reputation based partner of choice

207
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.869
or concern for reputation. And so I don't think

208
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.190
we necessarily have to reflexively decide that it's either

209
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.530
con selection or it's reciprocal altruism or else let's

210
00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:16.359
bring in group selection. Um So I think there

211
00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:20.450
are multiple mechanisms that are really important for understanding

212
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.320
how co-operation evolves. Um Interdependence is arguably even more

213
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.510
important than reciprocal altruism in a lot of cases

214
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.039
where individuals have a stake in one another's fitness.

215
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:35.659
And so they're incentivized to help their interaction partners,

216
00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:39.700
even if there's no uh no scope for repayment

217
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.150
from those partners. I think now we there are

218
00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:44.330
lots of mechanisms we know about that can support

219
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.690
cooper operation and group selection is just one of

220
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.929
those and arguably the least parsimonious given what we

221
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.489
know about how evolution works

222
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.549
and what are families from an evolutionary perspective?

223
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.440
So a family, I think a family is a

224
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.409
special kind of social group. So it's a stable

225
00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:17.140
social group, um obviously usually comprised of genealogical relatives.

226
00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:19.880
Um In our own case, I think we tend

227
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.090
to think of families as being nuclear families, mum,

228
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.770
dad and the kids. Um BUT in fact, nuclear

229
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.760
families are a bit of an outlier for in,

230
00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:33.215
in nature, but also in our own species. The

231
00:13:33.224 --> 00:13:35.594
nuclear family is a bit of an outlier when

232
00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:39.025
you consider our long history on this planet. And

233
00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:42.465
also if you think outside of the western model

234
00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:45.534
of society and look more broadly at other cultures,

235
00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:49.265
the western model of the nuclear family is really

236
00:13:49.275 --> 00:13:53.599
quite unusual and where we see family life in

237
00:13:53.609 --> 00:13:57.070
humans, but also in other species, which are often

238
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.369
called co-operative breeders, family tends to be based on

239
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.020
a more extended notion of family. So you often

240
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.830
have um a breeding pair or the mother and

241
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.059
father and then several other individuals, relatives who might

242
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.830
live in the same stable social group and might

243
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.880
all contribute to raising offspring within that group.

244
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.309
So since you mentioned the nuclear family, and because

245
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.080
this ties back to questions that people nowadays are

246
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.419
discussing particularly in politics about the role that the

247
00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:34.909
nuclear family plays and how important it is. I

248
00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:39.140
mean, since we have such high degrees of cooper

249
00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:43.679
breathing, particularly looking cross culturally and back in time,

250
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.419
I mean, uh I is it really that important

251
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:52.510
for Children to have at home, both a mother

252
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.770
and a father or, I mean, is it at

253
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.960
least one of them essential or could, can they

254
00:14:57.969 --> 00:15:02.299
be replaced by other people or other? I mean,

255
00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:05.809
family and perhaps friends and perhaps even in the

256
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.000
case of, of modern societies, other people from certain

257
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.200
institutions.

258
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.760
So I think this is one question which has

259
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.440
been massively thrown into sharp relief by the pandemic

260
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.880
that we're currently experiencing. And for anyone like me

261
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.400
who has, who lives in a western nuclear family,

262
00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:29.719
where you have a mum and dad and Children

263
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:34.219
at home, the experience of having school closures and

264
00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:37.890
the usual um sources of help, the way that

265
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.909
we outsource our childcare to these institutionalized um forms

266
00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:46.590
of childcare has really exposed just how dependent we

267
00:15:46.599 --> 00:15:49.599
are on help to in order to be able

268
00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:53.109
to successfully raise offspring. And I think this is

269
00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.770
a, there is a more general point here like

270
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.327
you said, which is that there is an ideology

271
00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:01.767
and it is an ideology in the West that

272
00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:04.966
the mother is the, she ought to be the

273
00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:09.486
exclusive caregiver for her offspring and is the irreplaceable

274
00:16:09.497 --> 00:16:12.377
caregiver for her offspring. And that if a mother,

275
00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:16.206
for example, outsources that childcare by sending her child

276
00:16:16.216 --> 00:16:20.026
to nursery when they're too young or, or outsourcing

277
00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:23.484
it to other forms of, of institutionalized child, then

278
00:16:23.494 --> 00:16:26.333
she might be wreaking some kind of emotional damage

279
00:16:26.343 --> 00:16:30.153
or harm onto her child. And I think that

280
00:16:30.164 --> 00:16:34.364
that view is pernicious, not just because it enforces

281
00:16:34.374 --> 00:16:37.304
a patriarchal norm of women staying at home to

282
00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.044
look after Children and, and, and these things, but

283
00:16:40.054 --> 00:16:43.963
because it actually has no bearing on what we

284
00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:47.963
know about the reality of how humans evolved, which

285
00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:51.700
is that we evolved in extended family groups where

286
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.591
Children would have been raised by many, many different

287
00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:57.601
individuals and not just by the mother. And often

288
00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:00.161
not even the mother would not even have been

289
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:03.700
necessarily the primary caregiver. Um For a lot of

290
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.500
the time Children would have been raised by their

291
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.480
older siblings, by their grandparents, by various other adults

292
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.949
in around aunts, uncles and so on. Um And

293
00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.829
this idea that Children need to form this bond

294
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.329
with one individual in order to develop a secure

295
00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.729
attachment and that if that is somehow disrupted, that

296
00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:27.689
the child will go on to have emotional and

297
00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:33.569
behavioral problems, really has no empirical support. And also

298
00:17:33.579 --> 00:17:36.069
is just not in keeping with our view of

299
00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:38.949
with our, our understanding of how humans evolved. And

300
00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.859
the fact that Children have always grown up being

301
00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:46.680
looked after by multiple different caregivers. Um And the

302
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:49.349
reason we probably don't, we have the, we're able

303
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.420
to have these nuclear families or we're able to

304
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.729
persist in these nuclear families in the West is

305
00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:57.260
that we outsource that childcare nowadays to these various

306
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.150
institutions. And that's how, you know, that's we out,

307
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.974
we send our Children to school, you know, things

308
00:18:02.984 --> 00:18:05.635
like this. So I think it's in some ways,

309
00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:07.744
one of the messages in the book that I

310
00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:10.275
write in in the chapter on childcare is that

311
00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:14.435
the an evolutionary perspective would suggest that it's completely

312
00:18:14.444 --> 00:18:16.905
fine to send your Children to daycare. That's a,

313
00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:20.795
a very normal situation for a young human child

314
00:18:20.805 --> 00:18:23.574
to be immersed in, to be surrounded by other

315
00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:26.515
Children and to be looked after by multiple different

316
00:18:26.525 --> 00:18:28.714
caregivers, not just the mother.

317
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.689
So another question since we have so much cooperating

318
00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:39.209
co-operative breeding in humans and in the case of

319
00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:45.069
men, uh we have paternity, uncertainty. Why is it

320
00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:50.030
that paternal investment in humans evolved? I mean, I

321
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.599
I'm asking you that also because many times people

322
00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:57.390
say, and I'm not completely sure if this is

323
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.979
true that in comparing to other species, human males

324
00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:06.709
are sort of outliers in how much they invest

325
00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:07.829
in their Children.

326
00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:11.680
So you're right that humans are a bit unusual

327
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:15.160
as far as mammals go in, that males are

328
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.800
involved often in helping to raise the offspring. That's

329
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.729
not a human, that's not a universal. So there

330
00:19:21.739 --> 00:19:25.750
is some cross cultural variation in how involved fathers

331
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.459
are with raising their offspring and sometimes sometimes fathers

332
00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:31.900
aren't really involved at all. There are some societies

333
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.329
like the Da Toga in Tanzania where men are

334
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.800
really not involved at all in raising their offspring.

335
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.160
And there are other societies um like for example,

336
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.410
the, the matrilineal society called the um Mosi society

337
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.300
in China, where men actually have much more to

338
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.089
do with their sister's Children than they do with

339
00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:54.349
their own Children. So they're much more involved in

340
00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.540
raising their nieces and nephews than they are in

341
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.300
raising their own um offspring. So it's not a

342
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.494
hu it's not a universal, but there is a

343
00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:08.175
general pattern that, that human males are typically more

344
00:20:08.185 --> 00:20:11.844
involved in raising offspring than the average male mammal

345
00:20:11.854 --> 00:20:15.875
is. Um AND you mentioned paternity uncertainty. And I

346
00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:19.734
think for humans actually, as far as uh again

347
00:20:19.744 --> 00:20:23.354
in relation to other mammal species, paternity uncertainty for

348
00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:28.760
humans is typically relatively low. So our best evidence,

349
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.800
even though it's very difficult to be certain, indicates

350
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:37.800
that humans probably evolved um to uh uh to

351
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:43.199
be socially and sexually monogamous females probably weren't mating

352
00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:46.599
with multiple males at the same time. And we

353
00:20:46.609 --> 00:20:49.290
can infer this based on looking at things like

354
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.709
relative, the size of the testicles relative to the

355
00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:57.375
body size in humans and other ape species. The

356
00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:00.214
idea being that if females are what we call

357
00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:03.805
promiscuous in that they mate with multiple males, um

358
00:21:03.814 --> 00:21:07.005
during a single Easter cycle, males ought to grow

359
00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:09.474
bigger balls because they need to produce more sperm

360
00:21:09.484 --> 00:21:12.015
to be able to compete in sperm competition with

361
00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:17.219
other males. Human males, uh their rela their testy

362
00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:19.829
size relative to their body size is much closer

363
00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:23.270
to what we would expect. Um IF humans mating

364
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.800
system as ancestrally was more at the monogamous end

365
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.849
of the scale. And that implies that a relatively

366
00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:33.680
high degree of paternity certainty in humans compared to

367
00:21:33.689 --> 00:21:36.119
something like a chimpanzee, where females are much more

368
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.910
promiscuous and do mate with many males in the

369
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.140
group um within a single Easter cycle. Uh And

370
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.670
so, I think, um in part, we can understand

371
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.260
this evolution of paternal care through this, through there

372
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.969
being an increased certainty for human males that, that,

373
00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.910
that Children that they raise with their um opposite

374
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.250
sex partner are theirs. Um And also the fact

375
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.949
that humans evolved in much more difficult environments than

376
00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:09.479
the environments that are characterized by, by the great

377
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:13.469
apes that are alive today. And mothers really needed

378
00:22:13.479 --> 00:22:16.790
help in the production of young, they needed help

379
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.650
from fathers and other family members if they were

380
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.890
going to be able to successfully raise young. And

381
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.390
that's another really important reason why we see paternal

382
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.939
investment in humans and not so much in the

383
00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:33.189
other great ape species where mothers are much more

384
00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:37.500
able to raise offspring without assistance from other individuals.

385
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.849
Mhm. So I've already talked several times about grandmothers

386
00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:44.839
on the show. So I would like to ask

387
00:22:44.849 --> 00:22:48.170
you specifically about this since as far as we

388
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.310
know, it was women who tended to move to

389
00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:56.869
their husband's household when they married. I mean, why

390
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.280
is it that it is maternal grandmothers that tend

391
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.770
to invest more in their grandchildren than paternal grandmothers

392
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.339
and not the other way around considering that then

393
00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:12.900
the Children would be living in their father's household.

394
00:23:13.439 --> 00:23:16.050
Yeah, that's, that's a really interesting question. And it's

395
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.170
one that when, when I first started to learn

396
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.630
about these uh reproductive conflicts that prompted the evolution

397
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.000
of menopause. That was a question that I also

398
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.420
had as well because in some ways, you, your

399
00:23:29.469 --> 00:23:32.780
default assumption is that the younger female has moved

400
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.859
to live with the husband's uh family. And so

401
00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:40.824
the nearest available grandmother to help is gonna be

402
00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:43.135
the paternal grandmother. So why isn't she, why are

403
00:23:43.145 --> 00:23:48.074
paternal grandmothers less decisive for the survival of offspring

404
00:23:48.084 --> 00:23:51.665
and for the fecundity of females than maternal grandmothers?

405
00:23:51.854 --> 00:23:54.935
Um And it I asked Mike Can about this.

406
00:23:54.944 --> 00:23:57.045
He is the guy who he's one of the

407
00:23:57.055 --> 00:24:00.125
evolutionary biologists who has been very heavily involved in

408
00:24:00.135 --> 00:24:04.015
developing the theoretical models on the evolution of menopause.

409
00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:08.150
And he, his, he, his view was that the

410
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.300
model is correct. We fe we do see female

411
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.729
bias dispersal such that females are moving to live

412
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.810
with their husband's family and they're in closer proximity

413
00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:21.520
to their mother-in-law than they are to their own

414
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.219
mother. But as long as they don't move too

415
00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:27.140
far away, as long as that dispersal distance isn't

416
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.050
too far, then the maternal grandmother can still can

417
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.180
still manage to help her daughter um in rai

418
00:24:34.209 --> 00:24:37.630
with raising offspring and anything that that entails. And

419
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.449
so I think in my mind, at least I'd

420
00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:42.079
kind of always assumed that this dispersal was happening

421
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:44.699
over a really vast distance. And so, you know,

422
00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:46.719
you're leaving home and that's it, you're never gonna

423
00:24:46.729 --> 00:24:48.540
see them again. But I think probably the dis

424
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.505
the distances that we're talking about are not as

425
00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:55.875
prohibitive for allowing maternal grandmothers to still be involved

426
00:24:56.104 --> 00:24:59.334
in helping their daughters to raise young. And in

427
00:24:59.344 --> 00:25:01.515
fact, there are some data showing that when the

428
00:25:01.525 --> 00:25:04.635
distance moved by the younger female is far enough

429
00:25:04.645 --> 00:25:07.824
such that their, their mother can no longer help,

430
00:25:07.854 --> 00:25:12.104
then they, they actually experience reduced bund and reduced

431
00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:14.875
survival of their offspring because they don't have that

432
00:25:14.885 --> 00:25:17.864
assistance from their own mothers in producing young.

433
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:22.500
Yeah, it's interesting. I also have that idea that

434
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.979
when they moved, it was so far away that

435
00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:29.869
perhaps maternal grandmothers wouldn't be able to help there.

436
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.040
And I was even asking myself if we could

437
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:37.060
talk about male fill of pater in humans, but

438
00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:38.380
perhaps not.

439
00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:43.069
I think we don't, I think basically, uh I'm

440
00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:45.300
not an expert in this but the, as far

441
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.199
as we know, um I think our best estimates

442
00:25:48.209 --> 00:25:52.310
are that dispersal in ancestral human populations was female

443
00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:55.920
biased. And so, and I think the, the models

444
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.430
of the evolution of menopause and the reproductive conflicts

445
00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:04.209
and how those are resolved through relatedness, asymmetries between

446
00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:08.270
uh the paternal mother in law, the paternal grandmother

447
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.579
and the younger female makes sense under this framework

448
00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:16.660
of female biased dispersal. So I think that, um

449
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.420
I guess, I don't know, maybe new data will

450
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.949
come and things will be overturned. But my, I,

451
00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:24.989
at the moment, I sort of accept this consensus

452
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.680
that the dispersal in ancestral human populations was female

453
00:26:29.689 --> 00:26:30.520
biased.

454
00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:34.530
Right. So, I mean, but, but in the case

455
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.910
of grandfathers, do they play any role whatsoever? Why

456
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.290
is it that men have also such long lifespans

457
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.130
on average?

458
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.739
So there's um an evolutionary demographer called Rebecca Seer,

459
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:55.489
who's done lots of work on um who keeps

460
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.609
Children alive. That's the title of one of her

461
00:26:57.619 --> 00:27:01.530
papers who keeps Children alive and based on meta

462
00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:04.760
analysis of lots of different studies, um as you

463
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.380
might expect the most important person for keeping Children

464
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.560
alive in the first years of life is the

465
00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:14.280
mother, fathers have a much less decisive role to

466
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.689
play in the survival of their offspring. The presence

467
00:27:17.699 --> 00:27:20.560
of a maternal grandmother often has a positive effect,

468
00:27:20.869 --> 00:27:25.239
but the presence of grandfathers is really not decisive

469
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.030
at all for keeping Children alive. And so the

470
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.030
inference um from these, from these studies is that

471
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.400
grandfathers aren't really doing that much. Um AT least

472
00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.530
in these um in these studies for which we

473
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.189
have data, grandfathers aren't doing that much to keep

474
00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:47.762
their grandchildren alive, to improve the survival of their,

475
00:27:47.772 --> 00:27:51.363
of their grandchildren. And so yes, there is a,

476
00:27:51.373 --> 00:27:54.343
a question of why do you know, why do

477
00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:57.593
men get to then have this extended lifespan? And

478
00:27:57.603 --> 00:27:59.623
I think one of the most obvious answers that

479
00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:02.822
I've seen uh that makes sense is that a

480
00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:07.822
man can still continue to accrue reproductive success quite

481
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:11.442
late into his life. Um And without a substantial

482
00:28:11.453 --> 00:28:14.656
amount of investment, unlike, unlike women who have to,

483
00:28:14.845 --> 00:28:17.725
you know, get pregnant and just stay a baby

484
00:28:17.735 --> 00:28:20.776
and then um lactate after the baby is born,

485
00:28:21.076 --> 00:28:24.536
the investment involved for a male is much, much

486
00:28:24.546 --> 00:28:27.145
less. And so it could, it can simply be

487
00:28:27.156 --> 00:28:31.515
like these opportunities to continue to accrue reproductive success,

488
00:28:31.526 --> 00:28:35.615
can help to select um for a long lifespan

489
00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:37.265
in men as well as in women.

490
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:42.949
Mhm. So moving from families, why is it that

491
00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:46.619
it is so common from for humans to help

492
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.030
others they are unrelated to?

493
00:28:50.849 --> 00:28:53.569
So, yeah, I mean, this is a really big

494
00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:57.069
question and I guess whenever we ask a why

495
00:28:57.079 --> 00:29:01.280
question in evolutionary biology, we have to always recognize

496
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.969
that there are two different, broadly speaking, two different

497
00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:06.989
kinds of explanation that we could offer. So, on

498
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.459
the one hand, we can offer what we call

499
00:29:09.469 --> 00:29:13.689
proximate level explanations and they're simply concerned with how

500
00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:16.910
the behavior comes about what the motives are or

501
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.319
the maybe the physiological mechanisms that bring that behavior

502
00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:24.060
about. And we can also ask um what we

503
00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:27.189
call um Well, sorry, we can also provide what

504
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:30.219
we call ultimate level explanations. And those are more

505
00:29:30.229 --> 00:29:34.680
concerned with the evolutionary significance of the behavior. And

506
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:37.630
so when we ask why humans help strangers, if

507
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.160
we were to offer proximate level explanations, we might

508
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.319
be in the realm of thinking about things like

509
00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:45.680
warm glow, it feels good to help other people,

510
00:29:45.689 --> 00:29:49.469
or maybe we have a norm, psychology. And in

511
00:29:49.479 --> 00:29:52.000
the society that we live in, there's a norm

512
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.810
which dictates that you ought to help, you know,

513
00:29:54.819 --> 00:29:56.699
help people if you can, even if you don't

514
00:29:56.709 --> 00:30:00.219
know them. Um There, there are a bunch of

515
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.989
um proximate level explanations that you could offer to

516
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.839
explain why people might help others. And I really

517
00:30:06.849 --> 00:30:08.939
don't think it's as simple as saying, here's the

518
00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:11.819
reason there are, there are maybe, I don't know

519
00:30:11.829 --> 00:30:15.479
25 or 30 different kinds of proximate level explanation.

520
00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:17.880
Maybe more that you could offer to, to, to

521
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.979
that in answer to that question. If you want

522
00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:23.660
to give an ultimate level explanation of why people

523
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.849
help. Well, broadly speaking, we would say that um

524
00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.130
the tendency to help other individuals, if it has

525
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.670
any genetic basis would be under positive selection if

526
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.099
it increases the individual's inclusive fitness. So if it,

527
00:30:41.109 --> 00:30:44.089
if it generates some benefits in terms of survival

528
00:30:44.099 --> 00:30:48.359
or reproductive success, and there are a few evolutionary

529
00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:51.670
routes by which that could be achieved, for example,

530
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.760
um if you help other individuals, you might improve

531
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.209
your reputation and then you might then improve your

532
00:30:59.219 --> 00:31:02.040
standing or your social position, you might be more

533
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.770
likely to get helped, um, by other people when

534
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.920
you need it. Given that you have a reputation

535
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.219
for being a helpful person who is normally doing

536
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:13.599
the right thing for others, you might um, avoid

537
00:31:13.609 --> 00:31:16.199
being punished by other people if you, if you

538
00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:19.119
help in certain scenarios or if you don't defect

539
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.160
in certain scenarios. Um, THERE again, just like with

540
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.510
the proximate level of answers, there are, there are

541
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:29.520
multiple different routes by which a tendency to help

542
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.400
others could, could be reconciled with benefits at the

543
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.439
individual level. And you could see how it could

544
00:31:35.449 --> 00:31:37.479
be under positive selection.

545
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.359
Mhm. So if one of people's concerns is their

546
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:46.569
reputation, what about when they perform good deeds that

547
00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:49.900
are hidden from others? I mean, what do, why

548
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.189
do we do that? And what do we have

549
00:31:52.199 --> 00:31:53.280
to gain from it?

550
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.890
So, one of the really important things to bear

551
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.530
in mind when we're thinking about things like why

552
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.280
does a human, why do people help other people?

553
00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:04.060
Like I said, one, we can think about these

554
00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:06.819
two different kinds of explanation which we call proximate

555
00:32:06.829 --> 00:32:10.979
and ultimate. And often people don't often have to

556
00:32:10.989 --> 00:32:15.439
be aware of the ultimate level um of the

557
00:32:15.449 --> 00:32:18.329
ultimate function of the behavior for the behavior to

558
00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:21.719
be under positive selection. And so, um if we

559
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.930
take a completely different example, just because sometimes it's

560
00:32:24.939 --> 00:32:28.420
easier to think about something that's slightly different. If

561
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.560
you were to say why do people have sex?

562
00:32:31.709 --> 00:32:34.829
Well, on a proximate level, people have sex because

563
00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:37.550
they find it, um, you know, they enjoy it

564
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.229
or they desire to have it or they find,

565
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:42.910
you know, they find it subjectively rewarding. The ultimate

566
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.989
reason sex exists and the ultimate function of sex

567
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.719
is, or at least one ultimate function is to

568
00:32:48.729 --> 00:32:51.550
produce offspring. It's a pretty direct means to increase

569
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.260
reproductive success. That doesn't mean that every time we

570
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.910
have sex we're kind of thinking about, I'm gonna

571
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.319
get reproductive success. Now, like people, the proximate and

572
00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:04.729
the ultimate reasons why behavior exists can be completely

573
00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:07.670
separate. And often in our mind, we're not even

574
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.750
aware of the ultimate reason why we do something.

575
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.020
And so if you say something like why do

576
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:17.160
people give anonymously well for many people helping others

577
00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.079
or donating to charity or giving in an anonymous

578
00:33:20.089 --> 00:33:24.310
way feels very subjectively rewarding. It's a phenomenon that

579
00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:27.229
economists have called the warm glow of giving. And

580
00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:29.099
it, you know, makes you feel all fuzzy and

581
00:33:29.109 --> 00:33:32.150
nice inside to know that you've helped somebody. Um

582
00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:37.250
And that fuzzy warm feeling is evolution's way of

583
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:41.180
getting you to do something that on average is

584
00:33:41.189 --> 00:33:45.160
in your long term interest that on average might

585
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.079
be expected to result in reputation benefits or any

586
00:33:49.089 --> 00:33:52.170
other host of benefits that might occur because of

587
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:56.540
you performing a helpful action. And if, if occasionally

588
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.099
that doesn't happen, that doesn't mean that the whole

589
00:33:59.109 --> 00:34:03.060
strategy is, is under negative selection. It's a evolution

590
00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:07.189
works on averages, it works on average outcomes. Um

591
00:34:07.199 --> 00:34:10.800
And sometimes the reason why we do something is

592
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.760
really quite different to the evolutionary reason that that

593
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.550
behavior exists if that makes

594
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.239
sense. Yes, it makes perfect sense. But in the

595
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.060
book, you also talk about how people tend to

596
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:27.250
be uncharitable toward those who do good deeds. So,

597
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.550
I mean, why is that

598
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.100
then? Yeah. So that's another thing that I always

599
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.969
wanted to come to. So thanks for asking that

600
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:36.340
question. So one of the unusual things about human

601
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:41.320
psychology is that we don't just, we're not stuck

602
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:46.250
with observing behavior and having to assume that the

603
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.929
behaviors that we observe, that the intentions and the

604
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:53.929
outcomes are always perfectly aligned. So humans have this

605
00:34:53.938 --> 00:34:57.770
very sort of sophisticated form of cognition that some

606
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.580
psychological theory of mind that allows us to look

607
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.850
under the hood. When we see somebody doing something,

608
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.280
for example, giving to charity, we can look under

609
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.699
the hood and we can, we can actually entertain

610
00:35:12.709 --> 00:35:16.760
the possibility that the reason that someone's doing something

611
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:21.580
might be different to the reason that they, that

612
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.939
they are trying to signal. So for example, when

613
00:35:24.949 --> 00:35:28.399
someone gives to charity, we we know that often

614
00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:32.699
doing charitable acts can result in reputation benefits. And

615
00:35:32.709 --> 00:35:35.340
so when we see someone doing a charitable thing,

616
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.979
we can also ask ourselves, well, is the reason

617
00:35:38.989 --> 00:35:42.459
the person is giving to charity? Is it because

618
00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:45.600
they want to help that beneficiary or is it

619
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:48.959
because they actually want to improve their own image

620
00:35:48.969 --> 00:35:51.149
or their own appearance or how they look to

621
00:35:51.159 --> 00:35:55.610
other people? And this kind of skepticism is a

622
00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:58.219
uniquely human trait. I think it's one that we

623
00:35:58.229 --> 00:36:03.179
don't share with any other nonhuman species and it

624
00:36:03.189 --> 00:36:06.870
actually can result in some quite strange outcomes which

625
00:36:06.879 --> 00:36:11.010
is that often doing good doesn't lead to looking

626
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.219
good because people can be suspicious of the reason

627
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:15.969
why you're doing it. And if we suspect that

628
00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:19.129
people are acting with these calculated or self serving

629
00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:23.129
motives in mind, then we frequently withhold reputation benefits.

630
00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:27.459
And we don't, um, we don't afford that individual,

631
00:36:27.469 --> 00:36:30.620
the higher status that you might normally expect to

632
00:36:30.629 --> 00:36:33.780
result from doing these charitable things. And so in

633
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.879
some ways, you can then get into these counter

634
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:41.620
cycles of individuals actually hiding their altruistic behavior, for

635
00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:45.800
example, by donating anonymously or, um, something like that

636
00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:48.709
so that they don't invite this skepticism or this

637
00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:52.580
suspicion from other people. There's actually a really lovely

638
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.080
quote, um from Oscar Wilde, which I think really

639
00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:59.110
sums it up nicely, which is, it's something like

640
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.070
the nicest feeling in the world is to donate

641
00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.500
anonymously, but have somebody else find out about it.

642
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.229
And the reason that it's the nicest feeling in

643
00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:09.574
the world, it's because of course, if they think

644
00:37:09.584 --> 00:37:12.725
you're doing it anonymously, then all the skepticism that

645
00:37:12.735 --> 00:37:17.034
results from looking under the hood is vastly reduced

646
00:37:17.044 --> 00:37:20.495
because, uh, the, you know, there's no, it seems

647
00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:23.225
far less calculated when you do it sort of

648
00:37:23.235 --> 00:37:24.004
anonymously.

649
00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:29.100
So, but taking into account all of the benefits

650
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.870
we might get from helping other people talking from

651
00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:38.060
approximate level, perhaps just feeling good and ultimately, perhaps

652
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.860
even increasing our fitness. Can we say that people

653
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:48.870
are really altruistic or is helping behavior? Ultimately selfish?

654
00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:54.070
I think on a proximate psychological level, lots of

655
00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:57.010
what you would call helping behavior or altruistic behavior

656
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:02.750
is psychologically altruistic. It's, it's motivated from a genuine

657
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.780
desire to help other people or a genuine enjoyment

658
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.409
from, you know, doing the right thing. And so

659
00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:11.850
I, and I think this is where often I

660
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.620
run into, um or I get challenged by people

661
00:38:15.629 --> 00:38:17.379
because they think that you're trying to take the

662
00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:20.770
altruism out of altruism in a way by suggesting

663
00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.699
that um helping behavior can ultimately be explained in

664
00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:29.489
terms of benefits to the helpful individual. People will

665
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.820
often mistakenly assume that that means that all helpful

666
00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.179
behavior is performed in a calculated manner and with

667
00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:39.889
those benefits in mind. And that's not at all

668
00:38:39.899 --> 00:38:44.229
what an evolutionary perspective would say. So the evolutionary

669
00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:47.284
perspective to, to allow us for the fact that

670
00:38:47.294 --> 00:38:51.155
helping behavior can be psychologically pure can be very,

671
00:38:51.165 --> 00:38:57.435
very genuinely altruistic with no real calculated um uh

672
00:38:57.445 --> 00:39:02.594
desire to improve one's own position, supporting it. But

673
00:39:02.604 --> 00:39:07.334
that doesn't change the fact that those, those psychological

674
00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:13.090
motives, those proximate motives have probably been selected for

675
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.790
because ultimately in an evolutionary sense, performing helpful behaviors

676
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.020
or being co-operative is often the best way to

677
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:29.610
ensure evolutionary success. And so, yes, I think altruism

678
00:39:29.929 --> 00:39:32.820
a lot of the time is uh can be

679
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.500
understood in terms of self interest. If what you

680
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.300
mean is the self interest, the gene's own selfish

681
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.860
interest. But I don't think that that means that

682
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:46.500
all altruism is knowingly or calculatedly selfish.

683
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:51.219
So, could you tell us about interdependence?

684
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.040
Yeah. So I think, I mean, I mentioned at

685
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.179
the start that I think this is sort of

686
00:39:56.189 --> 00:40:01.459
a a neglected mechanism for supporting cooper operation relative

687
00:40:01.469 --> 00:40:06.189
to something like reciprocal altruism. Um Interdependence is just

688
00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:09.060
the idea that you have a stake in your

689
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:13.949
partner's well being or fitness more strictly speaking. Um

690
00:40:13.959 --> 00:40:17.790
I illustrate the idea of interdependence in the book

691
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.570
using a toy example, which is imagine if you

692
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:25.129
were in a rowing boat with um one other

693
00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:28.550
person and the boat springs a leak and the

694
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.949
boat's filling up with water and you both need

695
00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:34.199
to bail out the water to, you know, in

696
00:40:34.209 --> 00:40:37.040
order for the boat not to sink. Now, if

697
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.540
you, if you were the kind of uh prepared

698
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.169
individual on the boat and you brought one chocolate

699
00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:45.310
bar, but your friend didn't have a chocolate bar

700
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.459
with them, it could actually be in your own

701
00:40:48.469 --> 00:40:51.989
interest to share that chocolate with your friend to

702
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.459
the extent that that allows them to keep on

703
00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:58.000
bailing out the boat. If we assume that both

704
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.500
of you are needed to bail out the boat

705
00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.570
in order to stop it sinking, then you suddenly

706
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.050
become really interdependent and it can be in your

707
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.540
own best interest to help your interdependent partner. Even

708
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.429
if there's no expectation of reciprocity at that time,

709
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.060
simply because your partner, your own survival or your

710
00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.709
own well being is highly dependent on your partner's

711
00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:21.689
presence and your partner's um being there. And so

712
00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:25.149
this is the idea of interdependence and for many

713
00:41:25.235 --> 00:41:29.405
issues that live in groups or that have stable

714
00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:33.435
social interactions or repeated social interactions with the same

715
00:41:33.445 --> 00:41:36.735
individuals, it probably makes quite a lot of sense

716
00:41:36.745 --> 00:41:40.715
to think about these interaction partners as being interdependent

717
00:41:40.925 --> 00:41:45.215
rather than simply being to individuals that w that

718
00:41:45.225 --> 00:41:51.415
support cooper operation through um a highly dogmatic form

719
00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:54.850
of reciprocal altruism like tit for tat and the

720
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.750
difference between those two things is that in tit

721
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.050
for tat, it only benefits me to help you

722
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.250
if I think you're gonna help me in return.

723
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.929
And if I help you and you don't help

724
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:08.179
me, then I've just wasted my investment. If we're

725
00:42:08.189 --> 00:42:11.179
interdependent, it can benefit me to help you even

726
00:42:11.189 --> 00:42:13.189
if you don't help me in return. And I

727
00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:19.449
think that that idea of it um unconditional helping

728
00:42:19.459 --> 00:42:22.750
within these sort of established relationships is much more

729
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.639
in line with what we see in nature. And

730
00:42:24.649 --> 00:42:29.409
these relationships probably are often much more interdependent than

731
00:42:29.419 --> 00:42:32.050
we have previously um assumed.

732
00:42:33.919 --> 00:42:37.449
And and why do we care so much about

733
00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:39.760
what other people think of us?

734
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.429
Well, for humans, I think that we are all

735
00:42:44.439 --> 00:42:49.560
very, very sensitive to our image or our reputation.

736
00:42:49.929 --> 00:42:52.360
And some of the reasons for that are that

737
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:57.209
individuals that gain a good reputation are often more

738
00:42:57.219 --> 00:43:00.510
likely to be chosen as interaction partners. So if

739
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.949
you in experimental settings and also in real world

740
00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:07.659
settings, the most generous individuals are often the people

741
00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:10.949
that um in an experiment, people say they want

742
00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:13.379
to choose them as a partner in real world

743
00:43:13.389 --> 00:43:19.030
scenarios, those often occupy more central social network positions,

744
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.169
they have more social capital. Um And they're also

745
00:43:22.179 --> 00:43:26.679
more likely to receive support themselves if they fall

746
00:43:26.689 --> 00:43:28.750
ill or if they are unable to meet their

747
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.120
needs. For whatever reason, the individuals that have accrued,

748
00:43:32.129 --> 00:43:35.270
a good reputation are more likely to receive help

749
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.550
from others when they need it. And I think

750
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.620
there are uh this um this sensitivity to reputation

751
00:43:42.629 --> 00:43:46.489
can be explained in terms of our dependence on

752
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.719
one another and our dependence on our social connections

753
00:43:49.729 --> 00:43:53.370
to, to survive and to, to meet our daily

754
00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:58.719
requirements. And for sure, like the humans are massively

755
00:43:58.729 --> 00:44:02.550
concerned with our reputation and we don't really see

756
00:44:02.679 --> 00:44:07.000
much evidence of that in any other species apart

757
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.330
from the cleaner fish um system that I've worked

758
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.479
on with red one Bahari. So I tell you,

759
00:44:13.489 --> 00:44:14.399
a bit more about it.

760
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.169
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I have them on

761
00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:18.860
the show and we talked a little bit about

762
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.409
that. But yeah, please go ahead.

763
00:44:20.709 --> 00:44:23.949
So it's kind of again, it's this idea of

764
00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:27.850
the behavioral destination and the journey because cleaner fish

765
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.870
do show concern for reputation, but they do the

766
00:44:30.879 --> 00:44:34.090
cognitive journey they take to exhibit this concern for

767
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.610
reputation is very different to the cognitive journey that

768
00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.060
humans use to show concern for reputation. So briefly,

769
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.780
um, cleaner fish live on coral reefs and they

770
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.939
offer a cleaning service to their clients, which involves

771
00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:50.639
removing parasites from the surface of the skin. But

772
00:44:50.649 --> 00:44:53.560
there's a conflict between the cleaners and the clients

773
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.080
because the cleaners would actually prefer to eat living

774
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:01.340
tissues, mucus and scales um and not to eat

775
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.419
the active parasites. Now, some of the clients that

776
00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:08.800
a cleaner fish interacts with have a large home

777
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.479
range and that means that they have access to

778
00:45:11.489 --> 00:45:14.939
multiple cleaning stations within their home range and that

779
00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:17.770
means that they can afford to be fussy. So

780
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.649
if they, if they go to a cleaning station

781
00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:22.419
and they arrive there and they see something ending

782
00:45:22.429 --> 00:45:25.709
badly, they see the cleaner fish being chased by

783
00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:27.820
the current clients or they see the current clients

784
00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.969
swimming away very quickly, then the fussy client will,

785
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:34.090
can think, ok, I won't stay here. I'll go

786
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.770
some, I'll go to this other place that I

787
00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.300
know about this other cleaning station. Strangely enough, Cleaner

788
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.399
Fish seem to be aware when they're being watched

789
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:45.370
by these, what we call fussy or visitor clients.

790
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:51.169
And they are actually more cooper or they offer

791
00:45:51.179 --> 00:45:54.350
a better service to their current clients when they're

792
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.149
being watched by the fussy or the visitor client.

793
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:01.899
And this demonstrates a rudimentary concern for reputation in

794
00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:06.449
clean official caring about what other individuals think. And

795
00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:09.010
of course, in the cleaner fish, the cognition that

796
00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.239
supports this is not the ability to take perspective,

797
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.030
to understand what the client is thinking or to

798
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.870
impute beliefs to the client or anything like this.

799
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.320
It can simply be learned through trial and error

800
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.340
that if I do, if I cheat, then those

801
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.790
kinds of clients always swim away. So therefore, I

802
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.745
won't, I'll X parasites and um they learn through

803
00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:33.945
trial and error or through associative learning what behaviors

804
00:46:33.955 --> 00:46:36.965
bring about the rewards that they're seeking. And so

805
00:46:36.975 --> 00:46:39.995
it just again, it's this idea of thinking about

806
00:46:40.004 --> 00:46:44.264
the same behaviors but different cognition supporting those those

807
00:46:44.274 --> 00:46:46.594
same sort of behavioral outcomes.

808
00:46:47.669 --> 00:46:50.139
So at the same time, we also have lots

809
00:46:50.149 --> 00:46:53.229
of social comparison. I mean, we compare ourselves to

810
00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:56.580
others a lot. And I would imagine that particularly

811
00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.909
in circumstances where there's lots of inequality that would

812
00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:05.459
have negative psychological impacts on people. So I, I

813
00:47:05.469 --> 00:47:09.370
mean, in what way is the social comparison affect

814
00:47:09.379 --> 00:47:10.570
our lives?

815
00:47:11.419 --> 00:47:15.010
Yeah. Again, it's a super interesting question and I

816
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:19.120
think it's one where there's not actually, there's, there's,

817
00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:21.590
I wouldn't say there's a consensus yet in the

818
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.719
field as to whether social comparison is uniquely human

819
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:29.439
or not. So one way that social comparison can

820
00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:33.379
manifest is as a concern for fairness or disliking

821
00:47:33.409 --> 00:47:37.100
getting rewards that are less than what another individual

822
00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.739
gets. Um And in the lab, you can measure

823
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.739
this by asking whether individuals will refuse a reward

824
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.949
if a partner gets something better. And this can

825
00:47:46.959 --> 00:47:49.649
be a test of what we call inequity aversion.

826
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.500
Now, we know that young Children are usually very

827
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.139
averse to inequity and anyone who's spent any time

828
00:47:57.149 --> 00:47:59.060
with a young child will have heard them shout.

829
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:01.729
Oh, that's not fair. And this kind of tendency

830
00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:05.000
to appreciate what's fair and what's not fair comes

831
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.719
online at about four or five years old and

832
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:10.179
Children really start to be able to be sensitive

833
00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:13.429
to, I'm getting one thing and you're getting four

834
00:48:13.439 --> 00:48:16.540
things and that's not fair and they will actually

835
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:20.719
refuse. They will sacrifice their one sticker or their

836
00:48:20.729 --> 00:48:24.010
one sweet to prevent the partner from getting more

837
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.689
than them. When people have done similar studies with

838
00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:31.760
nonhuman primates and with other animals, the results are

839
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:36.189
much more mixed. And in my view, I don't

840
00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:39.110
think that the evidence is very strong to suggest

841
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.350
that other species have a concern for fairness. And

842
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.139
I think that many of the results in this

843
00:48:47.149 --> 00:48:52.310
field are more consistent with much simpler explanations of

844
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.540
um of of the cognition that supports rejecting unfair

845
00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.790
outcomes. For example, it can be due to frustration

846
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.340
at seeing something you want, that you can't get

847
00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:07.989
or having your expectations violated. Like you see that

848
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.409
one individual gets four, but you get one. And

849
00:49:10.419 --> 00:49:13.739
so you have it, it's not necessarily a social

850
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.830
comparison that we're seeing in, in other species in

851
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.750
the same way that we, that we see in

852
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.560
humans. Um And I think this concern for fairness

853
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.610
and this meritocratic psychology, if you like this idea

854
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.679
that things ought to be fair. And that uh

855
00:49:29.689 --> 00:49:32.959
for example, if we work together to achieve a

856
00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:36.350
joint outcome, then we ought to share the spoils

857
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.959
of that outcome where I shouldn't just take everything

858
00:49:38.969 --> 00:49:41.873
for myself and leave you with nothing, right? This,

859
00:49:41.883 --> 00:49:45.143
this is the kind of um psychology and the

860
00:49:45.153 --> 00:49:47.353
kind of behavior that a concern for fairness can

861
00:49:47.363 --> 00:49:50.123
support. And it's really a point where we really

862
00:49:50.133 --> 00:49:55.153
see quite strong divergence between humans and uh in

863
00:49:55.163 --> 00:50:00.532
particular chimpanzees where for example, even human Children who

864
00:50:00.542 --> 00:50:04.676
work together to get a reward will then voluntarily

865
00:50:04.686 --> 00:50:07.375
split that reward with the partner that they worked

866
00:50:07.385 --> 00:50:11.196
to get the reward with. Whereas in chimpanzees, if

867
00:50:11.206 --> 00:50:13.275
they, they will work together to get a reward,

868
00:50:13.285 --> 00:50:15.575
if they have to, but you never see the

869
00:50:15.585 --> 00:50:18.906
in the one individual then giving half to the

870
00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:21.216
other one that helped it. If they can monopolize

871
00:50:21.226 --> 00:50:23.885
the reward, they will monopolize it for themselves. And

872
00:50:23.895 --> 00:50:29.090
so you can see how this non meritocratic um

873
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.090
principle could be a real impediment to collaboration because

874
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.300
in a way, what's the point of working with

875
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.810
you on a task? If we at the end

876
00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.870
of it, you, I, you just keep everything for

877
00:50:37.879 --> 00:50:40.260
yourself and I don't get anything. And so I

878
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.120
think this kind of psychology, this c this concern

879
00:50:43.129 --> 00:50:46.300
for fairness which you call social comparison is all

880
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.860
part of the same thing. But it's a really

881
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:54.530
crucial foundation of our collaborative natures actually, and our,

882
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.560
our ability to work together to achieve joint success

883
00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.090
and to motivate individuals to work together, to achieve

884
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.060
joint success. And I think that is a real

885
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:10.750
point of divergence between humans and the other great

886
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.370
apes.

887
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.570
So talking about unfairness, this ability, we have to

888
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.689
join together and rebel against tyrannical leaders, for example,

889
00:51:20.719 --> 00:51:24.389
is it uniquely human? Do we also find it

890
00:51:24.399 --> 00:51:28.040
in other great apes, for example? And if not,

891
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.689
uh in what ways does it allow for us

892
00:51:30.699 --> 00:51:35.270
to affect social structures that we don't really find

893
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.699
in other great apes?

894
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.840
I think among the apes, it's quite unique. It's

895
00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:44.330
what Christopher Berm has called the reverse dominance hierarchy

896
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.139
where um individuals resist the actions of dominant or

897
00:51:49.149 --> 00:51:54.020
big shot um individuals and instead they work together

898
00:51:54.149 --> 00:51:57.919
to prevent any selfish minority from gaining an unfair

899
00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:01.459
advantage. Um And this is part of what why

900
00:52:01.469 --> 00:52:05.530
human societies are often described as being egalitarian. Unlike

901
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.540
many of the other great ape societies that are

902
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:12.489
often much more hierarchical, much more despotic and where

903
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.350
an alpha male often gets a great, much greater

904
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.169
share of reproduction than the other males in the

905
00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:22.610
group. How having said that I don't think it's

906
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.129
unique to humans because there are, I mean, when

907
00:52:26.139 --> 00:52:28.550
we, as I said, at the start, the reason

908
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.989
why I started the book by thinking about co-operation

909
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.629
inside our bodies is that I said that some

910
00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:37.600
of the common principles that we saw in the

911
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.969
evolution of co-operation to form individuals, we would also

912
00:52:41.979 --> 00:52:45.610
see at different levels or different scales of um

913
00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:49.570
evolution. And one of those general principles is this

914
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:54.260
idea of the collective pulling against the might of

915
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:57.179
any selfish entity that tries to gain an unfair

916
00:52:57.189 --> 00:53:00.889
advantage. And one place where we see that principle

917
00:53:00.899 --> 00:53:04.959
in action is actually inside our bodies where all

918
00:53:04.969 --> 00:53:08.340
the genes form what has been called a parliament

919
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.929
of the genes where they, they all work to

920
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.649
together in some ways to prevent the actions of

921
00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:19.580
any selfish genetic element or any selfish gene that

922
00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:23.540
tries to over replicate itself relative to the others.

923
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.280
They were the the rest of the genome works

924
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:29.620
together to prevent any of those selfish entities from

925
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.959
having their way and from disrupting the um the

926
00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:39.310
the stability of the collective in some social insect

927
00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:44.020
species. You see workers who work together to collectively

928
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:48.629
police the actions of any single worker who tries

929
00:53:48.639 --> 00:53:51.899
to lay eggs in the society. So sometimes worker

930
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.270
ants or worker bees can lay under fertilized eggs

931
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.189
that will develop into males. But the other workers

932
00:53:58.199 --> 00:54:00.489
in the society will often eat those eggs, they'll

933
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.449
cannibalize them. And that's called worker policing. And again,

934
00:54:03.459 --> 00:54:07.270
you see the might of the collective at work

935
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.469
in holding the kind of the interests of selfish

936
00:54:11.919 --> 00:54:16.419
entities, selfish genes, selfish individuals in check. And so

937
00:54:16.739 --> 00:54:20.020
I actually think that that pattern of the collective

938
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.169
a bit like a tug of war. The collective

939
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:24.659
on one end of the rope pulling against the

940
00:54:24.669 --> 00:54:27.290
in the individual selfish elements. On the other end

941
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.909
is a real common theme that we see at

942
00:54:29.919 --> 00:54:35.360
all levels of life and the transitions to greater

943
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:40.770
complexity, the evolutionary transitions to greater complexity occur when

944
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:45.120
that collective is able to overwhelm the interests of

945
00:54:45.129 --> 00:54:48.040
the selfish, uh the the the sort of selfish

946
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:48.949
entities.

947
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.850
So we're reaching our time limit. So, uh so

948
00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.300
let me just ask you one last question with

949
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.250
all of this in mind. I mean, with what

950
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.929
we know about the evolution of human cooper operation

951
00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:05.479
and how it works? Is it possible for us

952
00:55:05.489 --> 00:55:10.050
to foster uh large scale cooper operation? Like for

953
00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:14.449
example, nowadays, we have issues to tackle like climate

954
00:55:14.459 --> 00:55:19.280
change, which demand, I mean, international Co Ordination. Is

955
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:23.179
there something that you wrote about in your book

956
00:55:23.189 --> 00:55:26.860
or uh somewhere else about human cooper operation that

957
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.159
we can use with that with that goal in

958
00:55:30.169 --> 00:55:30.620
mind.

959
00:55:31.379 --> 00:55:36.909
So I think that many of the massive global

960
00:55:36.919 --> 00:55:39.770
problems that we face today are problems of failed

961
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.209
co-operation and they are problems that require us to

962
00:55:44.449 --> 00:55:49.429
co-operate at global scales. And it's not obvious that

963
00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:52.550
this is something that we're especially good at. So

964
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.345
we're what one problem with global cooper operation in

965
00:55:56.355 --> 00:55:59.105
a way is that it's constantly at risk of

966
00:55:59.115 --> 00:56:04.406
being undermined by co-operation at lower levels and co-operation

967
00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:09.756
that's easier to achieve. So, for example, um nepotism

968
00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:13.506
and corruption and bribery are all forms of local

969
00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:16.746
co-operation that are quite natural to us in some

970
00:56:16.756 --> 00:56:20.931
ways, nepotism is helping us family corruption or things

971
00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:23.072
like that or can be helping your friends. I

972
00:56:23.082 --> 00:56:24.912
mean, these are forms of cooper operation and they

973
00:56:24.922 --> 00:56:27.531
are, they come much more easily to us in

974
00:56:27.541 --> 00:56:31.961
some respects than cooperating at a global scale with

975
00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:34.231
people that we don't know that we might never

976
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:37.652
meet. Um And so I don't think it's a

977
00:56:37.662 --> 00:56:43.860
given that we will necessarily be able to resolve

978
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:47.080
the global challenges that we face. And I certainly

979
00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.620
am not gonna sit here and tell you that

980
00:56:48.629 --> 00:56:51.830
I have the answers. But II, I also don't

981
00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.810
think, I don't think it's totally out of our

982
00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.989
grasp to do it. But I think it, it

983
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.870
in it will involve us learning how to co-operate

984
00:56:59.879 --> 00:57:04.850
at a scale that we've never really before managed

985
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:10.580
to do effectively. And so I guess it's for

986
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:12.709
me, I think it's still really an open question

987
00:57:12.719 --> 00:57:16.770
how the human story really ends and what, whether

988
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:21.419
we managed to over climate disaster and, and you

989
00:57:21.429 --> 00:57:25.330
know, o overcome future pandemics that we're going to

990
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.620
experience and things like this, I think we can

991
00:57:27.629 --> 00:57:29.949
do it. Um But whether we will do it,

992
00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:32.389
I think is up to us.

993
00:57:33.889 --> 00:57:37.100
OK. So, uh the book is again, the Social

994
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.550
Instinct of cooper operation shaped the world. Uh Where

995
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.750
can people find you on the internet?

996
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.159
Um I am probably most easy to find on

997
00:57:47.169 --> 00:57:50.840
Twitter where I my handle is at Nicola Rajani.

998
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:53.649
My full name, I have a website called the

999
00:57:53.659 --> 00:57:57.000

1000
00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:00.050
University College London. And yeah, you can find me

1001
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.260
there.

1002
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.409
OK. So it's been a real pleasure to talk
