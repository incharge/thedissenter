00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.930
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.699
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.609
joined for a second time by Dr Gordon Ingram.

4
00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.750
He is now senior lecturer in Psychology at RMIT

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.909
University Vietnam. And until recently, he was at the

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.049
Univers the, at the Universidad de Los Andes in

7
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.719
Colombia. And today we're focusing on his book, Adolescent

8
00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:27.510
Use of New Media and internet Technologies, debating Risks

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
and opportunities in the digital age. And of course,

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.639
I'm leaving also the link to our first interview

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.250
on the show in the description. So Dr Ingram,

12
00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.599
welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.240
to talk to you.

14
00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:42.259
Thank, thank you Ricardo and thanks a lot for

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.340
the invitation and for having me back. It's a

16
00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:47.810
great honor coming considering some of the names you've

17
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.369
had on the show. So, thanks a lot.

18
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.849
Yeah. No, it's uh totally my pleasure. And uh

19
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459
in fact, when I, as I was saying off

20
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.150
record, when I got across your book, I was

21
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.700
really happy because I've been uh I've already had

22
00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.199
uh actually a couple of conversations on the show

23
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.919
about some of these topics and people tend to

24
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.730
come from one extreme or the other when approaching

25
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:15.120
the potential psychological effects of new media, the internet

26
00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:17.900
and other kinds of new technologies. And I think

27
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.559
that your book is very balanced uh what in

28
00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.930
its approach. So te tell us actually about the

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.690
approach that you have in the book to studying

30
00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:32.750
the effects or the potential effects of new media

31
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.190
and internet technologies and uh how it compares to

32
00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.949
perhaps some of the more uh I don't know,

33
00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.589
typical or mainstream approaches that we see that tend

34
00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:48.650
to be based on moral panics, fear mongering and

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.510
stuff like that.

36
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:53.440
Ok. Well, I guess, um like uh as we

37
00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:56.879
were talking in, in the previous interview, um which

38
00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.699
I really enjoyed by the way and, and, and

39
00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.349
thanks again for um doing the interview so well

40
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.910
that the first time I thought it was really,

41
00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:06.779
really good. Uh But uh I always sort of

42
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.119
come at psychology from an evolutionary point of view.

43
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.559
So when you're looking at new technology, I think

44
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.229
it's natural to have the assumption that we evolved

45
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.889
in a different environment, you know, uh um uh

46
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:22.000
to be cosmides, talk about the environment of evolutionary

47
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.279
adaptive. This obviously, uh and this didn't include new

48
00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.860
technology. So it doesn't seem, you know, coming at

49
00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.449
it from that point of view, it doesn't seem

50
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.509
implausible that new technology could cause mental health problems.

51
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.339
The same way that say junk food, lack of

52
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.380
exercise causes us physical health problems. Uh And I

53
00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.960
think maybe that causes me to take a different

54
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.759
point of view from some other social scientists who

55
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.369
might maybe start from a more blank slate point

56
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.699
of view. So they tend to think, well, if

57
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.419
Children grow up with new technology, this is what's

58
00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.570
normal for them. And there's no reason why it

59
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.389
should be any more harmful than any other kind

60
00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.500
of culture that, that Children grew up, grew up

61
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.729
on. So there's peop I think sometimes if you

62
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.940
take a blank state of view, you might be

63
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:11.029
quite skeptical of people who are suggesting special risks

64
00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.470
of new technology and think, well, they're just engaging

65
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.850
in moral panic because the digital world is very

66
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.350
different, different to the world that they grew up

67
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.020
in. So it seems kind of unnatural and threatening

68
00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.119
to them. But at the same time, I think

69
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.029
also I'm coming at it from the point of

70
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.399
view, you know, influenced by people like Joe Henry

71
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.990
K who, who see uh the human adaptation is

72
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.440
mostly about culture. So yeah, we are very flexible.

73
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.240
So there may be risks but not necessarily huge

74
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.589
risks. I think we're capable of adapting to new

75
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.270
technology just as we adapted to lots of other

76
00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.160
cultural technologies over time.

77
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.580
And so why do you focus in the book

78
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.679
on adolescents specifically? I mean, is it just because

79
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.350
you tend to focus your research on adolescents or

80
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.220
is there any other special reason for focusing on

81
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.360
adolescents in this specific case and not, for example,

82
00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.389
adults or Children.

83
00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.639
Yeah. Um, WELL, I think, I mean, it, first

84
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.460
of all, it, it, it perhaps should emphasize that

85
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.740
new technology is not, not just about adolescence and

86
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.480
some, for some reason, they tend to kind of

87
00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:19.589
bear the brunt of the, the moral panics and

88
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.350
so on or maybe go into that a bit

89
00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:25.290
later. But, but, um, obviously all ages these days

90
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.880
are using technology and, you know, down from age

91
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.760
one really to, to, to age 90 or whatever,

92
00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:36.079
everyone's using internet tech technology, right. Um, BUT I

93
00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:39.269
think it's pretty clear that adolescents and young adults

94
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.820
maybe going up to, you know, the mid twenties

95
00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:45.630
are really like the driving force in new technology

96
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.059
adoption because older people, we tend to have our

97
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.149
own set way of doing things. Um, WE do

98
00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.910
adapt to new technology eventually, but it takes us

99
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.750
longer because of the kind of inertia of, of

100
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.700
different habits that we, we built up over our

101
00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:02.589
lifespan. Uh, WHEREAS adolescents are going in with a,

102
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.260
with a more open mind, they're experimenting with everything

103
00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.929
and, and they'll, they'll, you know, master this new

104
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.250
technology and adapt it to their own uses, uh

105
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.839
much more, much more easily. Uh And if you

106
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.500
compare them with younger Children, younger Children don't have

107
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.690
as much freedom to explore new technology, to use

108
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.690
it to develop new social relationships like teenagers do

109
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.380
so I think adolescents are kind of in that

110
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.649
sweet spot for, for a new technology uh adoption.

111
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.600
And then the second reason really is that adolescents

112
00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:36.369
are uniquely vulnerable because they're kind of separating emotionally

113
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.209
from their families from the kind of dependence on

114
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.809
their families, they're developing their own identity in terms

115
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.260
of the brain, the brain is still going through

116
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:46.619
a lot of changes up until the mid twenties.

117
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.910
Um So this means that they're at a point

118
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.540
in life where they tend to suffer a lot

119
00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:55.220
of psychosocial problems. Adolescents have the highest rates of

120
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.890
depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, delinquency, substance abuse, you

121
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.089
name it basically, almost any mental health problem or

122
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.260
behavioral problem. Adolescents have the kind of highest rates

123
00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.170
of it. So um that means that they, if

124
00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:15.559
there's any kind of effect of online actions on

125
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.750
these mental health problems, they'll probably be at their

126
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.440
most, the the strongest effects will really be an

127
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.959
adolescent. So for both, both those reasons, I think

128
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.649
it makes sense to focus on that age group.

129
00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:29.489
So something that I mentioned in my first question

130
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.679
and you also talk about in your book is

131
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.000
or are moral panics? And I I guess it's

132
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.190
also interesting to address that here because uh your

133
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.540
book is not only focused on the potential psychological

134
00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.799
effects that new media and internet technologies might have

135
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:53.089
on adolescent specifically, but also uh in understanding uh

136
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.250
why people approach this topic the way they do

137
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.450
usually. So to start off with, what is a

138
00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:06.369
moral panic, what characterizes a moral panic? Well, it's

139
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.929
a concept

140
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.829
that really has been used more in sociology than

141
00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.200
in psychology. Uh, AND there's an awful lot written

142
00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:16.630
about moral panics and in sociology, it basically is

143
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.220
a concern about certain kinds of behavior in a

144
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.609
society, it tends to appear quite suddenly. So, you

145
00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.269
know, it's a concern that wasn't there, you know,

146
00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.390
the previous year or two years ago. Uh AND

147
00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.040
it's shared across a broad section of society. So

148
00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:34.079
it's not just religious fundamentalists or whatever, it's so

149
00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:36.679
many groups of people are concerned about it. It's

150
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.519
not, doesn't tend to be based on hard evidence.

151
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:43.290
Um BUT more on anecdotes. So something like, you

152
00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:45.959
know, say the concern about COVID-19 a couple of

153
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.559
years ago wouldn't count really as a moral panic

154
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.260
because there was a new disease there that was

155
00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.679
actually killing people. So it's not just something that

156
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.279
people have, have kinda have kind of taken to

157
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.850
based on anecdotes. Um And finally, it tends to

158
00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:01.779
disappear almost as quickly as it appeared. So a

159
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.329
good example would be, for example, in the nineties.

160
00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:07.329
Um I remember there was a lot of panic

161
00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:11.809
about new drugs like ecstasy, for example, young people

162
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.660
going out to raves, taking these drugs and maybe

163
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.630
dying from dehydration, that sort of thing. And so

164
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.100
there's a lot of media stories about this and

165
00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:21.000
then a couple of years later, you know, it

166
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.510
just sort of became part of the accepted kind

167
00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.649
of youth subculture that young people went out and

168
00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:27.589
took these drugs and you didn't see the same

169
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.950
kind of media interest in it. So that was

170
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.989
a kind of often drugs like that are, are

171
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.520
kind of classic example of a moral panic that,

172
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.340
that takes hold

173
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.729
and why is it that moral panics so many

174
00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:43.729
times focus on young people. Why young people specifically?

175
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.109
Well, I'm actually writing uh uh a theoretical article

176
00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:49.830
about or trying to write a theoretical article about

177
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.349
that at the moment. So, um it's, it's, it's

178
00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:54.880
very interesting, I think because if you look at

179
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.270
the sociologists, the sociological literature, they don't really tend

180
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.950
to focus much on the, the content of moral

181
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.619
panics. What they're interested in is the kind of

182
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.690
social reaction, you know, the politics behind it, the

183
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.489
different social groups, how they're, how they're, um, how

184
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.239
they're responding to the moral panic as it were.

185
00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:17.900
Um And so what I was interested in when

186
00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.900
I looked at different examples of moral panics was

187
00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:23.559
that they nearly always seemed to concern young people

188
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.679
uh more than other groups of people and often

189
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.299
were to do with new technology, new cultural practices,

190
00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:30.960
which explains why the moral panic just suddenly appears

191
00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:33.320
out of nowhere because it's something that people weren't

192
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.859
really doing before. So I think what I try

193
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:37.070
to do in the, in the article is I'm

194
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.820
trying to look at it from a cultural evolutionary

195
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.369
point of view and say, um, young people are

196
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.630
the ones driving cultural change. And this is something

197
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.690
that can be maybe threatening to older generations. So

198
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.729
it's, it's often the older generations who are particularly

199
00:09:50.739 --> 00:09:52.820
engaging in the panic. And I think there's a

200
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.770
sound reason for that, which is that older people

201
00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:59.200
have adapted their behavior, adapted their practices to a

202
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.760
certain cultural environment. And then when they see young

203
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.390
people changing that environment, it's, there's a kind of

204
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.700
concern. Well, I taught my, my Children or we

205
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.109
taught the younger generation a certain set of skills,

206
00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:13.200
these skills are not gonna be useless because everything

207
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.450
is changing. They're adopting these new uh ways which

208
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.250
are often associated with other social groups, uh you

209
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.750
know, other ethnic groups sometimes. So it's, it's something

210
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.190
which can be threatening in terms of, of feeling

211
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.510
that the skills that you taught your Children or

212
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.890
the younger generation are not going to be applicable

213
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.669
in the new digital world. So I think that,

214
00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:33.369
and, and by the way, do you think that

215
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.890
could also apply to themselves? I mean, perhaps that

216
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.000
they themselves feel that they are no longer adapted

217
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.599
to the new world they're living

218
00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:46.929
in. Well, I think it psychologically it's, it's definitely

219
00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:49.979
probably generating some strong emotions. I think that explains

220
00:10:49.989 --> 00:10:52.229
a lot, the emotional charge with, with the moral

221
00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:55.539
panic is that it's all very strange, unfamiliar and

222
00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:57.119
and there's something threatening about it. You know, I

223
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.099
think as humans, like I said, we, we evolved

224
00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:02.669
to live in a cultural environment to identify with

225
00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.260
the cultural practices of our kind of ethnic group.

226
00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:07.330
And so when you, when you see these new

227
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.479
cultural practices coming in, maybe it, it can be

228
00:11:09.489 --> 00:11:12.200
linked you a lot of moral panics can also

229
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.109
have to do with immigrants and, and, and it

230
00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:16.659
can be, can be linked to this concern about

231
00:11:16.669 --> 00:11:19.640
losing your own cultural practices, being replaced with another

232
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.460
group's cultural practices, which I think it makes sense.

233
00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:24.710
We'd be a adapted to be concerned about that

234
00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:24.869
really

235
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.950
and uh relevant to our conversation today. Why are

236
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.700
these moral panics so many times focused specifically on

237
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.179
new technologies or cultural practices?

238
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.340
Um But again, I, I think it's about cultural

239
00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:44.799
change. So it's when there's something unfamiliar, it, it's

240
00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:47.059
seen as kind of alien in some way, what's

241
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.799
new is also seen as somehow alien as different.

242
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.940
Uh And what you notice as well. Another thing

243
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.239
you notice with, with these things with, with these

244
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.520
panics about new technologies, it's not just about any

245
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.289
kind of technologies. It's there's often sort of recurring

246
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:07.549
themes in these moral panics. So things that really

247
00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:12.049
activate strong emotions. So things like suicide, drugs, sexual

248
00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:16.330
abuse, religious indoctrination, they're often sort of connected with

249
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.599
the use of, of new technology in some way.

250
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:20.869
Uh And it seemed, I think the idea is

251
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.020
that with this kind of these interactions that young

252
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.929
people are engaging in online, they're not as kind

253
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.429
of insulated from negative influences about these sorts of

254
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.049
behaviors that they would have been in the power

255
00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:34.770
and the kind of idealized past that the older

256
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.559
generation is thinking of where the community kind of

257
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.090
had control of the younger people and protected them

258
00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:42.580
to some extent from, from these kind of damaging

259
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.890
interactions. So I think that's driving a lot of

260
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.599
these concerns about new technology as well.

261
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.419
Uh And by the way, it is, of course,

262
00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:54.280
uh doesn't apply only to newer technologies like we

263
00:12:54.289 --> 00:12:56.440
have now the internet and so on, this is

264
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.840
a very, or seems to be a very old

265
00:12:58.849 --> 00:13:03.599
phenomenon of older people reacting badly to new technology

266
00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:07.880
because I've listened to podcasts and read books about,

267
00:13:07.989 --> 00:13:12.234
since the 19 century people having bad reactions to

268
00:13:12.244 --> 00:13:17.075
romance novels, mirrors teddy bears, cars, bicycles. I mean,

269
00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:19.065
basically everything out there.

270
00:13:19.695 --> 00:13:21.945
And yeah, that's a really good point and, and,

271
00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.375
and that's, that kind of feeds the sort of

272
00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:27.854
standard liberal dismissal of these fears. Oh, well, you

273
00:13:27.864 --> 00:13:30.125
know, people have always been having moral panics. It's

274
00:13:30.135 --> 00:13:31.784
just that you're stuck in your own ways and

275
00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:35.315
stuff, but I'm not sure if it totally kind

276
00:13:35.325 --> 00:13:37.715
of negates the, the, the, the problems of it

277
00:13:37.724 --> 00:13:40.820
because, because I mean, one of the examples, uh

278
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.929
I think, I think Christopher Ferguson in, in one

279
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.299
of his articles, talks about this or, or his

280
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:48.739
book talks about, uh for example, the panic about

281
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.979
the uh Gutenberg printing press and when people could

282
00:13:51.989 --> 00:13:54.809
print the Bible in German or French or whatever

283
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.900
language and every day people could read it. And

284
00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:01.419
the Catholic establishment got very, very panicked by this.

285
00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:04.250
But if you think about it, that that panic

286
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.179
wasn't entirely unreasonable because obviously the Gutenberg Grinding Press

287
00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:12.070
led to the growth of protestantism. And, you know,

288
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.280
this everyday kind of engagement with religion that the

289
00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:18.229
Catholics were really trying to, trying to get, trying

290
00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:19.739
to stop, you know, they, they wanted to sort

291
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.239
of have a monopoly on, on religious practice. So

292
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.640
their fear in, in, in to some extent was,

293
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.760
was, was quite reasonable. And I think, um, as,

294
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.070
as scientists, we really need to think about, uh,

295
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.950
you know, are we just dismissing people's fears or

296
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.219
are we acknowledging that, that there is some kind

297
00:14:36.229 --> 00:14:38.200
of reason why they, why, why they, why they

298
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.020
have problems with this, with these kind of changes

299
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.400
that, that technology is, is, is wreaking upon society?

300
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.400
And so what would you say would be a

301
00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:52.289
proper scientific response to moral panics in society? Because

302
00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:56.000
I guess that the two extreme responses would be

303
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.530
to just completely dismiss it because, oh, it's just

304
00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:02.784
a moral panic. It doesn't matter or to sort

305
00:15:02.794 --> 00:15:06.135
of jump on the bandwagon of the moral panic

306
00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:09.315
and go ahead with it and, and basically say

307
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.794
that, oh, yeah, it is completely supported by the

308
00:15:12.804 --> 00:15:17.075
scientific evidence, even if it is weak. Right? So

309
00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:19.554
how should scientists react to them?

310
00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:22.510
Yeah, I, I think you're totally right. The reaction

311
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.919
has been very polarized. Um I think there's also

312
00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:30.320
sometimes a different stream discipline. So I get the

313
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.190
sense that in psychiatry, they're a bit more sympathetic

314
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.229
to the idea that new technology causes mental problems.

315
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.099
A lot of psychologists have been more skeptical. Uh

316
00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:41.049
And so you can get a lot of criticism

317
00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:43.950
kind of across disciplinary boundaries, which is interesting as

318
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.330
well. But, but you're right, there is um people

319
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.400
like J Twang, for example, in psychiatry is maybe

320
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.049
sometimes has been accused of, of cherry picking the

321
00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:56.510
data, you know, focusing on the results of the

322
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.099
studies which show harm in ignoring the ones that

323
00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:01.619
don't. Um On the other hand, you have people

324
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.390
in psychology like Chris Ferguson, Linda Kay who basically

325
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.710
are almost uh reading between the lines, almost accusing

326
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.330
um people like twang who are, who are proposing

327
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.400
a danger um at or, or um or um

328
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.320
uh it's getting the name that's Bradman, I think

329
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.570
is another one in, in, in the US. But

330
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.229
they uh they are accusing them of, of basically

331
00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:28.479
almost, you know, making up the, the risk to

332
00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:32.010
or emphasizing exaggerating the risk to, to sell books.

333
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.210
And I, I think essentially, and I think this

334
00:16:35.219 --> 00:16:39.809
is, you know, I, I think there's room to,

335
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.619
to acknowledge that probably both sides are, are acting

336
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.169
in good faith and, and are just seeing kind

337
00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:48.320
of different aspects of the picture. Uh And we

338
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.380
can be a bit more reasonable and just look

339
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.150
at the evidence and take a more evidence based

340
00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:55.090
approach, acknowledge that there may be certain risks. Uh

341
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.140
BUT probably in the public mind, they have become

342
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.890
a bit exaggerated because of the tendency to moral

343
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.919
panic uh that I mentioned, but we can't just

344
00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:07.719
dismiss these, uh, these moral panics. I think sometimes

345
00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.719
the term moral panic is, is used as a

346
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.729
way to shut down debate and just, uh, you

347
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:14.598
know, you're being unreasonable, you're engaging in moral panic.

348
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.108
And it's not acknowledging that people do have certain

349
00:17:18.118 --> 00:17:21.949
fears which are quite reasonable given our evolutionary history

350
00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:24.439
as cultural animals, as I tried to explain in

351
00:17:24.449 --> 00:17:25.858
the, in the previous, the previous ones.

352
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.119
Yeah. Actually, one of the reactions I tend to

353
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.810
like the most are from people like Stuart Rie

354
00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:38.133
and other Zoo. For example, when it comes to

355
00:17:38.272 --> 00:17:43.312
the potential psychological effects of Instagram and social media

356
00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:47.062
on adolescents and particularly girls, I mean, they've looked

357
00:17:47.072 --> 00:17:51.192
at the evidence and when they write articles about

358
00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:55.243
it, uh, usually the conclusion they write there is

359
00:17:55.253 --> 00:17:58.306
that we're not, I mean, it's sort of a

360
00:17:58.316 --> 00:18:02.355
mixed bag, but the evidence in favor of them

361
00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:06.375
of there really being negative psychological effects tends to

362
00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:10.156
be weak but we're not sure. I mean, the,

363
00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:14.375
the moral panic probably is not warranted, but at

364
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.796
this point we can't really say much about it.

365
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.390
Well, that, that's

366
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.699
what, um, it, it's one thing that interests me

367
00:18:22.709 --> 00:18:26.150
is that often people like that are, are much

368
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.069
more reasonable in the published articles than if you

369
00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:31.150
actually follow them on Twitter and, and things like

370
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.510
that. They can be a bit more, a bit

371
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.589
more kind of nasty in, in what they say

372
00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.689
in, in social media, which is interesting in itself,

373
00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:40.119
you know, maybe it's just a kind of off

374
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.489
the cuff response. They're not putting as much thought

375
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.819
into it as, as when they write an academic

376
00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:48.589
article. But you do see some statements basically sort

377
00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.800
of saying, oh, this is all a myth and,

378
00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:53.410
well, actually, you know, the, the there is some

379
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.170
kind of evidence that kind of indicates that there

380
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.819
are some risks. You can't just say that there's

381
00:18:56.829 --> 00:18:59.540
no evidence at all, but they, they do in

382
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.790
some of the less kind of guarded statements you

383
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.579
will, you will find people, uh, especially, uh, someone

384
00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:06.900
like Chris Ferguson is very kind of competent on,

385
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.760
on Twitter will, will, will say a lot of,

386
00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:12.060
uh, a lot of quite strong things on there.

387
00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:15.420
No. Yeah, I've read Doctor Ferguson on the show

388
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:21.939
and these very feisty words. So, uh, we'll, we'll

389
00:19:21.949 --> 00:19:25.699
get more into the social media stuff later on.

390
00:19:25.709 --> 00:19:28.180
But, uh, just before we get into the specific

391
00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:31.410
topics that you explore in the book, you focus

392
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.489
broadly on three different types of risk, young people's

393
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.290
identity, the types of content that uh they access

394
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.760
and social relationships. So why did you pick these

395
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.770
three specifically? Um I guess I

396
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.579
basically, they, they come when I was thinking of

397
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.380
a way to kind of structure the different types

398
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.489
of risks, I guess I was thinking about uh

399
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.540
maybe the kind of level of of interaction involved

400
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.790
uh the kind of different types of social interaction

401
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.949
really. So the first one I saw was a

402
00:20:05.959 --> 00:20:11.949
kind of cultural identity. So um for example, indoctrinate,

403
00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:15.150
if you think of like indoctrination into a certain

404
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.550
group kind of behavior. So obviously an obvious example

405
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.910
would be like political or religious radicalization. But also

406
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.010
if you think about the availability, for example of

407
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.979
um kind of different cultural subcultural groups. So groups

408
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:32.349
where they kind of advocate suicide that you do

409
00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:35.439
unfortunately get group groups where people kind of give

410
00:20:35.449 --> 00:20:37.579
tips for suicide and this sort of thing or

411
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:40.810
even like pro self harm uh or uh pro

412
00:20:41.069 --> 00:20:43.640
anorexia. So these sort of things where uh the

413
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.839
the online experience kind of facilitates someone kind of

414
00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.199
choosing a certain kind of identity, which could actually

415
00:20:50.209 --> 00:20:54.160
be quite damaging to them. Uh Secondly, just in

416
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:59.020
terms of passive consumption of content, so uh things

417
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.689
like uh violent video games, they might have damaging

418
00:21:01.699 --> 00:21:06.260
effects, uh pornography, particularly extreme pornography, obviously could have

419
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.619
certain damaging effects without any kind of social interaction.

420
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.550
It's simply through consuming content. And then finally, the

421
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.489
level of kind of interpersonal interaction where the online

422
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.719
media might facilitate some forms of exploitation. And there's

423
00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:24.000
lots of different forms of of exploitation, even kind

424
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.310
of economic exploitation sometimes. But I guess the classic

425
00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:30.869
examples would be like cyber bullying or online sexual

426
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.930
abuse. So basically those kind of three levels of

427
00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:38.449
kind of community or cultural identity, passive consumption of

428
00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:41.900
content or or interpersonal one on one kind of

429
00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.540
interaction,

430
00:21:43.349 --> 00:21:45.939
cyber bullying, by the way, is something that we

431
00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:48.810
talked about in our first interview. So for the

432
00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:51.859
audience, if you're interested, please go and watch that

433
00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:55.869
one. Uh So let's start then here in terms

434
00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.810
of the topics with self-concept and self-esteem in Netherlands.

435
00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:03.000
So uh first of all, uh tell us a

436
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.229
little bit about what these terms mean and then

437
00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:09.910
how do they play out online?

438
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.390
Well, that's a great question and um self concept

439
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.790
is basically basically kind of identity. So it's like

440
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.339
kind of what kind of person do you see

441
00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:22.959
yourself as? And it gets into, you know, it

442
00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:25.319
kind of links both personality, you know, what, what,

443
00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:27.729
how you sort of see your own behavior, how

444
00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:30.449
you see other people perceiving you and also you

445
00:22:30.459 --> 00:22:34.130
maybe kind of subculture cultural identity. So whether someone's

446
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.000
a goth or a, a jock or a nerd,

447
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.640
you know, it's kind of so the high school

448
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.660
subculture kind of things um and self esteem, I

449
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.079
think is most people understand. But self esteem is,

450
00:22:46.089 --> 00:22:48.969
is kind of whether you see how, how, whether

451
00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:52.079
you uh see other people viewing you positively or

452
00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:54.680
negatively. So both of them are kind of linked

453
00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:57.699
with how you think of other people perceiving you.

454
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.199
And this is something that's quite new in adolescence.

455
00:23:00.209 --> 00:23:03.979
Basically, young Children have the the great luxury of

456
00:23:03.989 --> 00:23:07.079
not, not having to think very much about what

457
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:08.579
other people are thinking about them, right? But then

458
00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:11.339
eventually you start thinking, hm, actually, you know, that

459
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:13.589
person has a certain image of me and it's

460
00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:15.989
positive or negative. And when you start having to

461
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.449
do that over and over again, for all the

462
00:23:17.459 --> 00:23:19.140
people around you, it can, it can get quite

463
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.020
overwhelming obviously for adolescents, it's quite new to them.

464
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.060
But

465
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.060
basically you get that sort of an age where

466
00:23:25.069 --> 00:23:28.180
you notice that reputation matters.

467
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.459
Exactly. Exactly. And, and again, that's, um, that's, uh,

468
00:23:32.469 --> 00:23:35.910
that's very uh adaptive and, and I think we

469
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.680
talked about that in the last interview as well.

470
00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:40.469
It's something that's unique to humans, really this kind

471
00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:43.290
of this kind of consciousness of their reputation in

472
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.160
the whole social group. Um And pro probably had,

473
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.000
you know, important uh inhibit inhibitory effects on, on,

474
00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.109
on our behavior um in terms of the effects

475
00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:58.189
of the online environment on this. Um I think

476
00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:00.449
it's, it's a very good question and, and this

477
00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:02.760
is why I get a bit, ok, there are

478
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.890
people exaggerating the risks. It's true. But I also

479
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.880
get a bit a bit frustrated with people just

480
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.459
dismissing the risks out of hand because we really

481
00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:11.300
don't know as, as you said about Stuart Ritchie

482
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.310
concluding in his articles, we just don't have enough

483
00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:16.930
evidence now to be really sure about the answer

484
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.994
and probably it is gonna have profound effects, not

485
00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:25.055
necessarily damaging effects, but profound effects on how we

486
00:24:25.064 --> 00:24:28.104
conceive of, of our self concept or self esteem,

487
00:24:28.114 --> 00:24:30.824
et cetera. So if you look at adolescents, they're

488
00:24:30.834 --> 00:24:33.234
obviously in a sensitive period, they're going through massive

489
00:24:33.244 --> 00:24:36.665
changes in the self concept, the self esteem, they

490
00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.675
tend to suffer actually from a kind of cognitive

491
00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:43.625
illusion where they overestimate. Uh BECAUSE this, this is

492
00:24:43.635 --> 00:24:46.055
kind of a common kind of cognitive bias, right?

493
00:24:46.064 --> 00:24:48.380
When, when something is new to you, you, you

494
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.969
think about it too much. So because they've gone

495
00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:53.760
from not thinking at all about how other people

496
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.760
are, how much other people are thinking about them,

497
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.349
they tend to go too much in the other

498
00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:00.510
direction and think that other people are thinking about

499
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.810
them all the time. Whereas obviously they're not, I

500
00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:04.890
mean, their parents are are thinking about their kids,

501
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.630
but most of the time, you know, they're, they're

502
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.540
thinking about their job or, you know, other things

503
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.250
as well. They're not just thinking about the kids

504
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.930
all the time and that's even more true, obviously,

505
00:25:11.939 --> 00:25:14.930
for, for people who aren't related to them. So

506
00:25:14.939 --> 00:25:17.310
you know, they, they're, they're friends also have other

507
00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:19.430
friends. They're not just thinking about one friend all

508
00:25:19.439 --> 00:25:22.849
the time. They're not necessarily offended by something they've

509
00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:26.219
done, et cetera, et cetera. And so they, adolescents

510
00:25:26.229 --> 00:25:29.130
can get overly self conscious because they suffer from

511
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.109
this illusion that other people are always judging, always

512
00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:35.319
observing the behavior, always analyzing their behavior when really

513
00:25:35.329 --> 00:25:37.430
they aren't, you know, devoting so much time for

514
00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:37.520
it.

515
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.260
That sounds very similar to the spotlight effect. Right.

516
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.930
Yeah, I think it's a, it's a, it's a

517
00:25:43.939 --> 00:25:45.829
kind of version of that. Yeah, it is. But

518
00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:48.550
it's particularly, um, there is a term for it

519
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.750
in, in adolescence as well, which I've momentarily forgotten

520
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.280
but it is in, it is in the book,

521
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.359
if you, if you look it up. So, um,

522
00:25:55.369 --> 00:25:58.400
they, uh, they basically have this kind of bias

523
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.780
towards, towards sort of feeling themselves more observed than

524
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.270
they actually are. Uh, AND I think it's interesting

525
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.660
to think about how that will interact with online

526
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.579
interactions because it does kind of give you maybe

527
00:26:11.589 --> 00:26:14.209
a biased view as well, but it can maybe

528
00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:17.109
give you kind of more information about how other

529
00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:19.339
people are actually judging you. So if you're constantly

530
00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:22.359
posting photos saying different things, you can sort of

531
00:26:22.369 --> 00:26:25.010
see how people are reacting to you and it's

532
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.040
not all sort of just left in people's heads

533
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.599
and in ephemeral verbal conversations, you can actually think

534
00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:33.349
about it and sort of judge the reaction that

535
00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:36.329
your your actions are having on, on other people.

536
00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:39.140
So I think this will give in some ways.

537
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.839
I think it it could actually be positive. It

538
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.079
could help adolescents to get more socially mature and

539
00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:46.920
and understand the effects of their actions and their

540
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.300
image presentation as on other people. But also in

541
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.160
certain individuals, it could be problematic because if they're

542
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.420
very sensitive, they could take certain kinds of reactions

543
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.510
quite badly online.

544
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.920
And are there any important gender differences in online

545
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.699
identity?

546
00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:07.810
Oh for sure. Um Remember though um the all

547
00:27:07.819 --> 00:27:10.790
gender differences are are statistical rather than absolute because

548
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.290
I think there's a tendency uh you know, the

549
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.380
people outside academic circles can interpret, interpret differences between

550
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.010
girls and boys in essentialist kind of ways as

551
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.599
if so. So I'm not saying here that all

552
00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:25.630
girls are one way and all boys another

553
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.439
way. Yeah, I mean, we have to keep in

554
00:27:27.449 --> 00:27:30.650
mind that these are always average differences and there's

555
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.130
lots of overwhelm.

556
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.420
Yeah. And I know you know that but just

557
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.939
in, in terms of one set of viewers to

558
00:27:37.099 --> 00:27:38.729
to get the the wrong impression of what I'm

559
00:27:38.739 --> 00:27:40.930
saying. But sure, but I think generally we can

560
00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:44.560
look at some general statistical differences. So girls tend

561
00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:48.150
to spend more time over uh interacting over pure

562
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.530
social networks like uh Instagram, Snapchat, et cetera. Boys

563
00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:56.199
can still have a lot of social interaction online

564
00:27:56.209 --> 00:27:59.119
but relatively will be more through the medium of

565
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.609
gaming. And of course, there are plenty of girls

566
00:28:01.619 --> 00:28:03.770
who enjoy gaming as well. But in terms of

567
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.650
statistical differences, boys will be more through gaming. Uh

568
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.550
GIRLS more through sort of pure social networks and,

569
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.939
and girls tend to emphasize visual self pre presentation

570
00:28:13.949 --> 00:28:17.280
more while boys focus on their accomplishments, competing in

571
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.910
things like games, et cetera. Uh YOU can see

572
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.310
this very clearly in the, in the, in the

573
00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:23.869
case of online dating as well. Kind of um

574
00:28:23.989 --> 00:28:25.459
when we get on to maybe talk a bit

575
00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:26.900
about online dating later,

576
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.209
which actually follows the lines of what would be

577
00:28:30.219 --> 00:28:32.790
predicted by evolutionary theory,

578
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.410
right. Yeah, this kind of uh I think this

579
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.750
is one area where the evolutionary predictions have been

580
00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.219
quite well borne out. So there's uh um uh

581
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.930
uh some uh some study by Frank mcandrew, for

582
00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:49.579
example, for an early study of Facebook use where

583
00:28:49.589 --> 00:28:53.079
they made some pretty clearly pretty good evolutionary driven

584
00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:56.030
hypotheses and found some pretty solid evidence that girls

585
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.780
and boys were using Facebook in very, in very

586
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.239
different ways. And I think it also explains the

587
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.699
the the the kind of visual presentation in girls

588
00:29:05.709 --> 00:29:08.390
and their dominance in this sort of pure social

589
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.170
network space. Kind of explains maybe as well why

590
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.040
Instagram has become more popular than Facebook uh among

591
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.319
young people? Because if you look at Instagram, the

592
00:29:17.329 --> 00:29:20.119
image is very much the kind of center of

593
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.619
it there is text there and it, you know,

594
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.069
the textural interaction can be very important on Instagram

595
00:29:26.079 --> 00:29:28.439
as well, but it's like it's secondary to the

596
00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:30.119
presentation of the image. And I think that makes

597
00:29:30.775 --> 00:29:34.275
suits girls better than the kind of more text

598
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.964
driven uh interface that, that Facebook.

599
00:29:37.094 --> 00:29:40.974
Yeah, those long written essays or texts or texts

600
00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:43.614
is something that you would find more on Facebook.

601
00:29:43.994 --> 00:29:44.344
Yeah,

602
00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:48.035
exactly. Exactly. Um MEANWHILE, with, if you look at

603
00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:50.265
games, what are the kind of most popular games

604
00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:52.875
these days, there's been an evolution in the sort

605
00:29:52.885 --> 00:29:54.885
of games that boys are playing. They tend to

606
00:29:54.895 --> 00:29:57.515
be things like for Fortnite or Valorant, which are

607
00:29:57.525 --> 00:30:01.109
very kind of social experiences, but they're different kind

608
00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:03.219
of social experience than a social network because they're

609
00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:05.910
more team based. So it's more that you're kind

610
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.229
of cooperating with other people competing against other teams.

611
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.489
So you are learning social skills, you're engaging in

612
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.430
social interaction. But it's always for the purpose of

613
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:17.589
getting achievements in the game, which is very different

614
00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:19.510
from how girls are interacting online.

615
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:24.469
We'll talk more about gaming uh in a bit.

616
00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:28.989
But another problem or worry that many people have

617
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.390
has to do with screen time. And I guess

618
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.949
that in this particular case, people also worry about

619
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:37.150
scree screen time when it comes to infants and

620
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.699
young Children. But here we're focusing on adolescents. So

621
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.989
do we know if screen time really has any

622
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.520
relationship with well-being? Does it have an impact on

623
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.130
well-being.

624
00:30:49.189 --> 00:30:51.560
Well, there's been an awful lot of debate about

625
00:30:51.569 --> 00:30:54.310
this as you probably, you probably know. And the

626
00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:57.729
consensus is that any effects are, are pretty small.

627
00:30:57.739 --> 00:30:59.310
So there's one area where there does seem to

628
00:30:59.319 --> 00:31:02.540
be more moral panic than is really warranted by

629
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.119
the data. Um, AND, and I think most, almost

630
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.130
everyone would agree these days that it doesn't make

631
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.449
much sense to focus on screen time in the

632
00:31:11.459 --> 00:31:15.390
absolute, there was like an American Society of psychiatrists

633
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.199
that used to recommend uh um a two plus

634
00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:21.040
two rule, you know, sort of two hours a

635
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:25.079
day and then incrementing that for each age or

636
00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:27.319
something like that from two years of age. But

637
00:31:27.329 --> 00:31:28.819
they kind of abandoned that sort of thing now

638
00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:31.489
because they recognize, you know, if you're doing, say

639
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.800
a zoom call with your grandparents, if the child's

640
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.890
doing a zoom call with their grandparents, you don't

641
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.380
really have to worry about how much time they're

642
00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.680
spending. Zoom calling their grandparents. You know, this is

643
00:31:40.689 --> 00:31:45.060
pretty clearly a positive social interaction. So, um I

644
00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:47.449
think it very much the focus is now much

645
00:31:47.459 --> 00:31:49.540
more on what, what Children are doing with their

646
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.750
time online. Um, OBVIOUSLY there are extremes. So if

647
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.920
a teenager is spending 18 or 20 hours a

648
00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.979
day on that, and there are teenagers who spend

649
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:02.339
18 or 20 hours a day online. Unfortunately, this,

650
00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:04.739
this is, this is a thing. It's hard to

651
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.800
see how that can be good. For them really

652
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.989
because you know, it's obviously going to interfere with

653
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.319
sleeping, eating and bathing, et cetera. So then they're

654
00:32:13.329 --> 00:32:16.630
not really doing enough things off outside the screen

655
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.250
time that they should be doing. But likewise, we

656
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.609
have to look at the other extreme as well,

657
00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:22.890
someone's spending and, and often people have found this

658
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.130
kind of U shaped curve where you find negative

659
00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.270
effects for both, for both ends. And if someone's

660
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.839
spending zero hours online, what you get is, is

661
00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:33.640
this person, how is this gonna person gonna be

662
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.599
seen by other kids? The this teenager, you know,

663
00:32:36.609 --> 00:32:38.869
they're not gonna have the same cultural references, they're

664
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.910
not gonna be able to interact, they're gonna be

665
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.290
missing out on a lot of the online interactions

666
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.290
that, that the other teams are, are engaging in.

667
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.630
So that's not gonna be very good for them,

668
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.979
good for them either. So, uh I think the

669
00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:53.300
extremes tend to be, tend to be quite bad,

670
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.550
but in the middle, it's not so much how

671
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.890
much time they're spending online as whether they're engaging

672
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.099
in positive activities and whether they also have positive

673
00:33:01.109 --> 00:33:04.890
activities outside of, of screen time. So whether they're

674
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.770
also doing exercise, meeting up with friends, you know,

675
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.300
uh going to, to see music or, or, or,

676
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.689
or other cultural community activities. And if they're still

677
00:33:14.699 --> 00:33:16.420
getting plenty of those opportunities, I don't think it

678
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.839
really matters a great deal whether they're spending, you

679
00:33:19.849 --> 00:33:21.560
know, 10 hours a week or 20 hours a

680
00:33:21.569 --> 00:33:23.859
week online. It's, it's just kind of lost in

681
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:25.729
the, in the noise room. Yeah.

682
00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:28.829
So another thing that we've already touched on a

683
00:33:28.839 --> 00:33:32.489
little bit earlier. And actually this is very interesting

684
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.430
because back in September, October 2021 there was a

685
00:33:36.439 --> 00:33:40.520
data leak from Instagram that even again people like

686
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.209
Stuart Ritchie wrote about and what he said back

687
00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:46.489
then I remember it was something along the lines

688
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.135
of, oh yeah, we can't really tell from these

689
00:33:50.145 --> 00:33:55.295
data that there's any negative psychological effects of Instagram

690
00:33:55.305 --> 00:34:00.135
on girls specifically. But what do we know about

691
00:34:00.145 --> 00:34:04.204
the effects of Instagram use on body image? And

692
00:34:04.214 --> 00:34:06.854
I guess in this case, it would apply mostly

693
00:34:06.864 --> 00:34:08.635
to girls so

694
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.810
well that that's something I might, I might take

695
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.889
issue with actually. And, and I think, I think

696
00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:18.399
there's been a lot of focus on girls um

697
00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.129
which is interesting, you have to think culturally why

698
00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.199
has there been this this this kind of focus

699
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:25.719
on on girls? Maybe because like I was saying,

700
00:34:25.728 --> 00:34:28.668
we know that girls tend to present themselves more,

701
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.520
more visually. So it seems natural that there might

702
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.149
be a special effect on on girls. But actually,

703
00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.708
there has been a ton of study on a

704
00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:38.850
ton of studies on Instagram and body image in

705
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.179
the last few years. And yet we still don't

706
00:34:42.188 --> 00:34:44.149
seem to know very much there isn't you, you

707
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.500
look at the evidence, it's kind of like, like

708
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.438
like Richie says, it's kind of like me basically

709
00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.809
this, there's not much, there's not much there. Um

710
00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:54.648
And again, I think it's because there's so many

711
00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:57.878
different ways of using Instagram basically. So if a

712
00:34:57.888 --> 00:35:01.218
teenage girl is sort of doom scrolling as, as

713
00:35:01.229 --> 00:35:04.049
we say, you know, through, through pictures of skinny

714
00:35:04.059 --> 00:35:08.099
models, you know, interacting very passively and just thinking,

715
00:35:08.108 --> 00:35:10.388
oh, you know, I'm so fat compared to, compared

716
00:35:10.398 --> 00:35:12.468
to these girls that I see online clearly, that

717
00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:14.968
can be a negative experience for her. But then

718
00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:18.249
there are also plenty of people using Instagram. Um

719
00:35:18.259 --> 00:35:22.080
YOU must have heard the term fits. So when

720
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.310
people are following people to get exercise tips or

721
00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.310
diet tips, uh and they're also using it as

722
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.229
motivation. So they're seeing people that they respect who

723
00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:33.199
are going out and exercising early in the morning

724
00:35:33.209 --> 00:35:35.570
thinking actually, you know, I should do that that's

725
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.149
working for them. I should do that as well.

726
00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:39.580
So it can be like a really strong motivation

727
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.090
to, to, to get this visual evidence that people

728
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.070
are actually engaging in this behavior. So it very

729
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.120
much depends on the person and how they're using

730
00:35:48.129 --> 00:35:50.370
uh Instagram as to whether they're using it positively

731
00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:52.489
or negatively. And it's very hard to get at

732
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.229
this quantitatively. Maybe with qualitative studies, you can say

733
00:35:56.239 --> 00:35:58.699
this is working for people. This this aspect is

734
00:35:58.709 --> 00:36:01.439
problematic, but it's very hard to scale that up

735
00:36:01.449 --> 00:36:04.060
to a proper quantitative study. And, and really sort

736
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.770
of see what's positive for people, what's negative for

737
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.459
people and going back to the to the gender

738
00:36:09.469 --> 00:36:13.550
issues. Um What you notice is, is a lot

739
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.209
of the, the early studies on Instagram only included

740
00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:19.800
female participants. They, they actually just didn't bother looking

741
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.300
at, at males. Since then. There have been some

742
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:25.699
other studies with men finding that they actually share

743
00:36:25.709 --> 00:36:26.810
a lot of the can share a lot of

744
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.080
the same problems positively with, with body image that,

745
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.040
that, that they actually it can make them less

746
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.610
satisfied with their own body if they, if they're

747
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.790
constantly being exposed to, to kind of alpha male,

748
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.669
both sort of figures online. And um when you

749
00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:44.100
look at studies that most of the studies that

750
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.969
I've seen that compared including a couple of my

751
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:48.719
own students who, who did um studies of Instagram

752
00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:52.389
use in Colombia. And when there basically weren't any

753
00:36:52.399 --> 00:36:54.399
gender effects, I mean, and, and a lot of

754
00:36:54.409 --> 00:36:57.149
published studies are the same that you don't see

755
00:36:57.159 --> 00:37:00.629
that girls are necessarily more con concerned about their

756
00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:03.389
body image uh than men are uh in relation

757
00:37:03.399 --> 00:37:06.209
to Instagram use. So um I think it is

758
00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:08.510
kind of culture bias to think this is particularly

759
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.389
damaging to girls, which may maybe it isn't necessarily

760
00:37:11.399 --> 00:37:11.860
the case.

761
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.209
Yeah. And, and actually that's a very interesting point

762
00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:17.770
because uh I mean, if we look across the

763
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.189
internet, uh it's also very frequent for us to

764
00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:27.120
see uh I mean, content targeting men and, uh,

765
00:37:27.129 --> 00:37:31.100
uh, I, I mean, pictures of blood. Yeah. And,

766
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:35.080
and things related to levels of muscle mass and

767
00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.110
all of that. So, yeah, I mean, it would

768
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.409
be at least intuitive to, to a certain extent,

769
00:37:40.419 --> 00:37:44.205
to expect that at least certain men would perhaps

770
00:37:44.215 --> 00:37:47.344
feel more insecure with their bodies if they think

771
00:37:47.354 --> 00:37:50.395
that those bodies that they see on Instagram or

772
00:37:50.405 --> 00:37:53.844
elsewhere would be the ideal or the ones that

773
00:37:54.034 --> 00:37:55.544
women or girls tend

774
00:37:55.554 --> 00:37:59.145
to are attracted to. Exactly. Yeah. And um and

775
00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:01.304
maybe it wasn't something that they thought very much

776
00:38:01.314 --> 00:38:04.064
about, you know, girls were already thinking a lot

777
00:38:04.074 --> 00:38:06.475
about their body image but men before it became

778
00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:08.334
so kind of in their face with Instagram maybe

779
00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:10.215
weren't thinking about it. So, so that could be

780
00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:10.645
a problem as well.

781
00:38:11.469 --> 00:38:15.850
So another thing that people have been worrying a

782
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.159
lot about and going back to Jin Twenge and

783
00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:22.139
I guess Jonathan Haidt as well has to do

784
00:38:22.149 --> 00:38:26.570
with the impacts of social media on self esteem

785
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.709
and depression and, and also on the extreme end

786
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:34.495
uh se side. So what do we know about

787
00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:37.344
it at this moment? I mean, sh should we

788
00:38:37.354 --> 00:38:42.925
really worry that much about the potential negative psychological

789
00:38:42.935 --> 00:38:47.415
effects that social media might have, particularly when it

790
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:51.135
comes to these issues, depression suicide and so on?

791
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.149
Well, I think that there's some really elegant series

792
00:38:55.159 --> 00:38:56.879
in that area. I remember some years ago, my

793
00:38:56.889 --> 00:39:00.429
friend uh Charlotte, please published a really great evolutionary

794
00:39:00.439 --> 00:39:03.959
hypothesis about social media use and depression and, and

795
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:07.209
how depression might be linked to negative social comparison.

796
00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:08.820
So it, it, it makes a lot of sense

797
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.669
theoretically. But when you actually look at the data,

798
00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:15.350
it's not that there isn't that much data to

799
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.629
support it. Again, it it seems to be this

800
00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:20.979
kind of U shaped thing and that the extremes

801
00:39:21.169 --> 00:39:24.090
might be particularly bad. But if you're saying is

802
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.090
spending say seven hours a week on social media

803
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.479
versus 14 hours a week, you know, both are

804
00:39:30.489 --> 00:39:32.719
kind of in the normal range generally. What's bad

805
00:39:32.729 --> 00:39:35.419
for mental health is doing things which are outside

806
00:39:35.429 --> 00:39:37.860
of the normal range of behavior. So as long

807
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.080
as you're kind of keeping things fairly normal living

808
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.790
a a fairly normal life, you probably aren't gonna

809
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.149
have too many, too many mental health problems as

810
00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:48.040
well. The psycho that I read that most of

811
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.800
the psycho psychological evidence in that area anyway. So

812
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.840
I think um even with the extremes, the problem

813
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.939
is as well that there isn't necessarily causal evidence.

814
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.780
So people tend to report a correlation as if

815
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.899
it was evidence for a causal effect of social

816
00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:08.899
media use. But in fact, of course, it could

817
00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:10.540
be the other way around. It could be that

818
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.639
the fact that someone is already starting to have

819
00:40:12.649 --> 00:40:15.389
mental health problems is what causes them to use

820
00:40:15.399 --> 00:40:18.000
social media in a in a very extreme sort

821
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.129
of way. So for me, I, I tend to

822
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.100
take a very pragmatic approach to, to academia these

823
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.479
days. And it, it ii, I would prefer to

824
00:40:26.489 --> 00:40:28.449
kind of almost forget about the causal question because

825
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:30.260
I don't think we're ever going to work out

826
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.659
the causality in a way that everyone's happy and

827
00:40:32.669 --> 00:40:34.909
everyone is satisfied about it and everyone agrees on

828
00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:37.060
it. So I would kind of tend to say,

829
00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:39.520
well, it is important to look at how someone's

830
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.760
using the internet. But the extreme forms of internet

831
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.989
use might be more useful as a kind of

832
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.209
warning sign that someone could be having or about

833
00:40:48.219 --> 00:40:51.909
to have some sort of mental health problems. So

834
00:40:51.919 --> 00:40:54.260
if you, if you find, for example, I know

835
00:40:54.929 --> 00:40:58.199
certain people like they're always kind of, you know,

836
00:40:58.209 --> 00:41:00.979
you message them and they respond instantly or you,

837
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.469
you leave a Facebook comment and, and they're instantly

838
00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:05.629
kind of responding to it and you think you

839
00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:07.280
could think, you know, why is that, why is

840
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.780
that person, you know, so kind of plugged in

841
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.760
online that they're, they may be a bit obsessive

842
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.919
about instantly responding when looking at the phone, constantly

843
00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:17.870
checking the phone that the um the kind of

844
00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:21.649
nomo phobias, it's called the smartphone addiction. Yeah. And

845
00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:24.320
maybe that's indicative of, of something they're kind of

846
00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.149
trying to escape from in the, in the offline

847
00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:28.889
world. Maybe they're not as, as kind of immersed

848
00:41:28.899 --> 00:41:31.149
as they should be always in, in their interactions

849
00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:33.370
with the people around them in the offline world.

850
00:41:33.379 --> 00:41:35.149
So that could be something that, that's kind of

851
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.090
a sign of a sign of risk in their,

852
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.419
in their offline social interactions. But then conversely, if

853
00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:43.239
someone is using social media a lot and then

854
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.709
one day and I've seen people do this as

855
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:47.250
well. There's a, I'm leaving Facebook, you know, I've

856
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.379
had enough of Twitter and I'm just going and,

857
00:41:49.389 --> 00:41:50.590
and that's actually been a big part of their

858
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.860
life and then they just suddenly just cut that

859
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.870
off. I mean, I don't nothing wrong with, you

860
00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.389
know, decreasing your use over time. But may, maybe

861
00:41:57.399 --> 00:41:58.840
it's a bit of a warning sign if someone

862
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.479
is just going to zero social media use as

863
00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:04.149
well and maybe that it would be a good

864
00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:06.620
idea to reach out to that person, maybe make

865
00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:08.179
a phone call to them a few days later

866
00:42:08.189 --> 00:42:10.379
and just kind of check that they're, they're feeling

867
00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:11.959
ok and that sort of thing, you know, because

868
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.969
so I think I would prefer to see these

869
00:42:13.979 --> 00:42:16.129
kind of extremes of internet use it not as

870
00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:18.949
so much in causal terms and more kind of

871
00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:22.219
possible indicators or warning signs that, that, that something

872
00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:23.590
might be wrong there. Did you see what I

873
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:23.860
mean?

874
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.449
No. And I mean, here I'm just going to

875
00:42:27.459 --> 00:42:31.209
comment uh to make a comment because, uh, it

876
00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:36.030
bothers me quite a bit when people focus solely

877
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.530
on social media and are a little bit obsessed

878
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.889
about it when it comes to the rising rates

879
00:42:42.899 --> 00:42:46.520
of depression and suicide among young people. Because, I

880
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.354
mean, aren't there other alternative or competing hypothesis to

881
00:42:51.364 --> 00:42:55.895
consider here? Like, for example, the social economic, political

882
00:42:55.905 --> 00:42:59.334
context that we're living in, I mean, the future

883
00:42:59.344 --> 00:43:03.514
is very uncertain. We've had economic crisis. Uh uh

884
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:07.155
I mean, jobs are less secure. So I, I

885
00:43:07.165 --> 00:43:10.635
mean, I guess that there would be other factors

886
00:43:10.645 --> 00:43:13.179
to consider here. You totally

887
00:43:13.189 --> 00:43:15.379
anticipated what I was about to say though, actually

888
00:43:15.389 --> 00:43:19.800
about, about suicide in, in particular. Um YOU know,

889
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.830
a lot of the discussion about suicide tends to

890
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.040
be anecdotal. Uh YOU know, say someone was on

891
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.750
a, an online group discussing suicide and then killed

892
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.020
themselves or someone was being cyberbullied and then killed

893
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.860
themselves. The problem is you don't, you don't know,

894
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.330
it's impossible to know for sure that that person

895
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.830
wouldn't have killed themselves if, if they hadn't been

896
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.810
engaging in those, in those online activities. And when

897
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.120
you look at the quantitative data, um exactly what

898
00:43:45.129 --> 00:43:48.050
you were saying, there's social and economic factors, particularly

899
00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.810
the economy, there seems to be a much stronger

900
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.449
link between levels of suicide and whether the economy

901
00:43:53.459 --> 00:43:56.010
is doing well or doing badly than with the

902
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.699
introduction of social media. Um There's much, much clearer

903
00:43:59.709 --> 00:44:01.669
signal in, in the data, I think for the,

904
00:44:01.919 --> 00:44:03.629
for the effect. So you could say, if you

905
00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:05.810
really want to do something about suicides don't go

906
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.320
attacking social networks, focus on, on getting the economy

907
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.610
better or maybe making more opportunities because young people

908
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.969
are always saying, you know, and, and, and it's

909
00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:19.899
very true that the, the opportunities for, for work

910
00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:21.979
and for security in the, in the labor market

911
00:44:21.989 --> 00:44:24.760
aren't there that, that, that we're there uh in

912
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.370
their parents' time or their grandparents time. So maybe

913
00:44:27.379 --> 00:44:29.629
we should be to, to really combat suicide. We

914
00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:32.600
should be focusing on creating those kind of opportunities

915
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.760
and giving young people a sense of a, a

916
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.489
productive future that they can have rather than rather

917
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.060
than focusing on social networks.

918
00:44:40.189 --> 00:44:44.010
So uh another topic then is there such a

919
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.389
thing as internet addiction? I mean, and if there

920
00:44:48.399 --> 00:44:52.419
is what would be the criteria here to classify,

921
00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:56.060
be a particular behavior as internet addiction,

922
00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.659
I think that this is very um kind of

923
00:44:59.669 --> 00:45:03.179
controversial idea and that there's been controversy about being

924
00:45:03.189 --> 00:45:07.550
included in the World Health Organization, uh manual, you

925
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.479
know, disorders. Um I personally think that the concept

926
00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:14.479
makes sense. It does exist, but a lot of

927
00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:17.199
people are, are really implacably opposed to the, the

928
00:45:17.209 --> 00:45:20.040
very concept of the behavioral addiction. They want to

929
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.610
reserve the term basically for substance, substance addictions. Um

930
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.239
And I don't think we, we're gonna resolve that

931
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.870
debate anytime, anytime soon. I think people are very

932
00:45:28.879 --> 00:45:32.719
kind entrenched in those positions, but I think both

933
00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:35.560
both sides would agree that it's not just about

934
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.600
how much time, you know, again thinking of screen

935
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:41.399
time, addiction isn't just about how much time that

936
00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:44.879
you spend online. Um It's, it's more about whether

937
00:45:44.889 --> 00:45:48.790
it's interfering with other aspects of your life uh

938
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.919
and how good or bad you feel about the

939
00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:53.719
activity. The problem is that when people are measuring

940
00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:56.350
uh you know, the negative effects, they tend to

941
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.270
focus on the time and not whether someone is,

942
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.389
is using the internet in, in problematic ways, which

943
00:46:02.399 --> 00:46:04.949
might be a better indicator really of, of, of,

944
00:46:04.959 --> 00:46:08.409
you know, potential negative effects. So for example, if

945
00:46:08.419 --> 00:46:11.870
you think of um something which is pretty controversial,

946
00:46:11.879 --> 00:46:15.979
whether someone can be addicted to online porn, it

947
00:46:15.989 --> 00:46:18.379
probably depends a lot on the kind of social

948
00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:20.739
context. Right? In fact, there's uh uh some studies

949
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.929
have shown, um, it's someone's religious from a religious,

950
00:46:24.939 --> 00:46:27.969
strongly religious upbringing. It's more damaging for them to

951
00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:30.379
use online porn than, than someone who's not from

952
00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:31.649
a religious background.

953
00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:35.020
So, and actually, actually that bit, I've had an

954
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:39.090
interview two years ago with Doctor Nicole Rosi and

955
00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.090
she has done work on that and at least

956
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.840
according to her work and her conclusions, it seems

957
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:49.495
that it, it is tied a lot to moral

958
00:46:49.504 --> 00:46:54.864
considerations, right? And mo most people who present themselves

959
00:46:54.875 --> 00:46:59.125
or claim that they are foreign ethics that are

960
00:46:59.135 --> 00:47:00.544
religious. So,

961
00:47:00.554 --> 00:47:03.125
uh and they may even have issues with, you

962
00:47:03.135 --> 00:47:05.514
know, masturbation and that sort of thing because it's

963
00:47:05.524 --> 00:47:07.254
because they see it as a kind of something

964
00:47:07.264 --> 00:47:09.364
that, that is prohibited in the Bible or whatever.

965
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:12.090
So, um, I think that kind of context and

966
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.239
also, you know, you got to look at whether

967
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.969
someone's married or not. For example, if someone is

968
00:47:17.979 --> 00:47:20.250
using porn, only a couple of nights a week,

969
00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.050
but it's when the wife has gone to bed

970
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.560
and so they're losing sleep because of it. They're

971
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.889
feeling guilty because of it. They may have more

972
00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:31.899
negative effects from that than a single guy who's

973
00:47:31.909 --> 00:47:33.350
just using it in the early evening when he

974
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.850
comes home from work. And it's just a kind

975
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.320
of way of relaxing after work. You know what

976
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.179
I mean? So it's, you've got to look at

977
00:47:40.189 --> 00:47:42.389
the social context and it's not just about how

978
00:47:42.399 --> 00:47:45.709
much, you know, how many hours someone is engaging

979
00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:48.810
in a certain social activity, it's about whether they

980
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.969
feel a compulsion to do it, whether they feel

981
00:47:50.979 --> 00:47:53.300
that it's interfering with other aspects of their life.

982
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.459
And, and I think everyone can agree that that's

983
00:47:55.469 --> 00:47:58.979
the kind of the damaging aspect of it, whether

984
00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:01.120
or not we call it addiction. It's whether someone

985
00:48:01.129 --> 00:48:03.540
is, feels that it's having negative effects on their

986
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.340
life or whether no, it's just something I do

987
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.520
to, to relax and I'm not really worried about

988
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.290
it, that, that really makes it damaging or not.

989
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.000
Uh But uh if it's the case that many

990
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:18.159
people who say that they suffer from porn addiction

991
00:48:18.169 --> 00:48:22.590
are religious, I mean, would we then conclude that

992
00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:26.139
the problem there is the access to the program

993
00:48:26.495 --> 00:48:29.715
gray or the religious beca because, I mean, of

994
00:48:29.725 --> 00:48:33.114
course, it's affecting their lives, it's affecting their mental

995
00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:36.975
well being. But wouldn't we say then that it's

996
00:48:36.985 --> 00:48:42.114
mostly because of them having those moral values or?

997
00:48:42.584 --> 00:48:46.929
Well, I don't think it's, it does, um, come

998
00:48:46.939 --> 00:48:49.850
play a part in, in the propensity to see.

999
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.709
But I don't think it's necessary, you know, it's

1000
00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:55.290
necessary to be religious to, to have problems with

1001
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.889
addict. And you could also look at, say gambling

1002
00:48:56.899 --> 00:49:00.010
addiction, you'd probably find kind of similar phenomenon there.

1003
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.760
It might be more common for religious people to

1004
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:04.969
say they have, they have an issue with that.

1005
00:49:04.979 --> 00:49:06.860
But I think it means you've got to look

1006
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:08.820
at the whole social context when you're treating someone

1007
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.310
right. And not just say you can't just sort

1008
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.709
of have a cut off and it's amazing how

1009
00:49:12.719 --> 00:49:15.760
many empirical studies will have a cut off of

1010
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.030
a number. Oh, if they're doing this activity more

1011
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.050
than three hours per day, it's, it's problematic then.

1012
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.689
No, it, it's, you got to look at the,

1013
00:49:22.699 --> 00:49:25.050
the social context and that the person is in

1014
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.350
to say whether the, the addiction is something that's

1015
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.520
going to be problematic for them or not. And

1016
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.129
I think really we need to listen to people

1017
00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:34.540
more who are actually engaging in the activities and,

1018
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:37.379
and take a more, um, a less kind of

1019
00:49:37.389 --> 00:49:40.629
number crunchy approach and more kind of pragmatic, you

1020
00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:42.370
know, what are the problems that this person is,

1021
00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:43.709
is facing in this situation?

1022
00:49:44.229 --> 00:49:47.020
So, let's talk a little bit about gaming here,

1023
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:51.370
uh particularly online social gaming and the social bit

1024
00:49:51.379 --> 00:49:53.689
here is very important because there are games that

1025
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:57.050
we play alone. So I guess the effects here

1026
00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.969
wouldn't be the same. So, but when it comes

1027
00:49:59.979 --> 00:50:02.860
to online social gaming, what do you think are

1028
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:08.129
the most interesting psychological aspects to uh explore here?

1029
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.500
Well, I think that would, that would probably be

1030
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.969
an interview. So there's so much you can look

1031
00:50:13.979 --> 00:50:16.070
at. Um ONE of the things we've looked at

1032
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.300
a lot is prestige. So the the, you know,

1033
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.550
the importance of with, with some of my students

1034
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.879
at Los Angeles, we looked at the prestige and

1035
00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:25.919
online gaming and you know how uh boys in

1036
00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:28.790
particular might be kind of driven to by evolutionary

1037
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.479
pressures to kind of have this competition for prestige,

1038
00:50:31.489 --> 00:50:33.020
which explains a lot of the, the sort of

1039
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.850
behavior in the games. Um But I think for

1040
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.669
me that if I could pick one thing to

1041
00:50:38.679 --> 00:50:42.429
investigate, it would be gender, probably because uh I

1042
00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:45.860
think that the special identity of female gamers is

1043
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.060
really interesting because it's something that's becoming much more

1044
00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:49.840
common. If you remember back to the eighties and

1045
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:52.860
nineties gaming was seen as something very male, a

1046
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.199
very male activity. It still is probably a little

1047
00:50:55.209 --> 00:50:58.780
more male than female. But I think females make

1048
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.620
up something like 40% of, of committed gamers. Now.

1049
00:51:01.629 --> 00:51:04.219
It's becoming much more, uh, much more common for

1050
00:51:04.229 --> 00:51:07.860
women and girls to, to engage in. So I

1051
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:10.550
think it would be really interesting to see how

1052
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.270
they navigate being a female gamer. Do they? We've

1053
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.389
seen evidence for my students that they do suffer

1054
00:51:16.399 --> 00:51:20.669
discrimination. Men still make comments about, go, you know,

1055
00:51:20.679 --> 00:51:23.429
oh, they're, they're only good for playing a healer,

1056
00:51:23.439 --> 00:51:24.939
that sort of thing. They're not, they're not good

1057
00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:26.739
as a fighter. So you do, you do see

1058
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.054
quite a lot of sexism still? So it would

1059
00:51:29.064 --> 00:51:31.495
be interesting to see how they, how they kind

1060
00:51:31.504 --> 00:51:34.014
of deal with discrimination and what they get out

1061
00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:36.475
of gaming. Do they get the same things that,

1062
00:51:36.485 --> 00:51:38.834
that males get out of gaming or are they

1063
00:51:38.844 --> 00:51:41.875
getting something different out of gaming? Uh And why

1064
00:51:41.885 --> 00:51:44.014
is it such an important part of their identity?

1065
00:51:44.024 --> 00:51:45.695
You know, how do they, they kind of navigate

1066
00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:48.945
that identity? So, shout out to any uh potential

1067
00:51:48.955 --> 00:51:51.395
uh postgraduate students if you want to, if you

1068
00:51:51.405 --> 00:51:52.645
want to come and work with me on, on

1069
00:51:52.655 --> 00:51:54.675
that topic, I'd be really fascinated to do kind

1070
00:51:54.685 --> 00:51:56.995
of mixed method study of female gamers. And it

1071
00:51:57.004 --> 00:51:58.175
would be really, really cool.

1072
00:51:58.939 --> 00:52:03.439
And so just to tackle another moral panic, what

1073
00:52:03.449 --> 00:52:07.620
about violent video games? Do they really lead to

1074
00:52:07.629 --> 00:52:11.889
any sort of violent behavior? Or is there not

1075
00:52:11.899 --> 00:52:14.040
enough evidence to support that.

1076
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.530
Well, I think II I spent quite a lot

1077
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.649
of time that in the book and I genuinely

1078
00:52:18.659 --> 00:52:21.229
came at it with an open mind and because

1079
00:52:21.239 --> 00:52:23.179
it was, you know, as I say, the, the

1080
00:52:23.189 --> 00:52:25.229
positions were so polarized, it was hard to, to

1081
00:52:25.239 --> 00:52:28.310
see, you know, straight off with who was right.

1082
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:32.239
But, um it does, after reviewing all the evidence

1083
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.669
of over, you know, decades of analysis of this

1084
00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:37.229
question, it does seem like a fairly clear cut

1085
00:52:37.239 --> 00:52:39.270
example of a, of a moral panic. I think

1086
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.320
so. And it is something which has gone down

1087
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:44.120
over time, you know. So back in with Columbine

1088
00:52:44.129 --> 00:52:47.629
in the nineties, people were taking quite seriously the

1089
00:52:47.639 --> 00:52:50.179
idea that video games were causing these shootings. It

1090
00:52:50.189 --> 00:52:51.540
does seem to have kind of fallen out of

1091
00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.570
the discourse a bit these days. And I think

1092
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.129
Ferguson in particular is very convincing, sing on this.

1093
00:52:57.139 --> 00:52:59.780
He's basically pretty much devoted most of his, his

1094
00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.270
career to debunking us.

1095
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.889
By the way, when it came to Columbine, there

1096
00:53:04.899 --> 00:53:08.669
were, there were also people who said that the

1097
00:53:08.679 --> 00:53:11.870
culprit was, uh, Marilyn Manson and violent.

1098
00:53:13.409 --> 00:53:15.639
Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking that when you said

1099
00:53:15.649 --> 00:53:18.300
as well about other moral panics in history, you

1100
00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:20.840
know, there's a lot of history of rock music,

1101
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.620
rap music as well. You know, people say, oh,

1102
00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:26.389
this is gonna, is going to corrupt the minds

1103
00:53:26.399 --> 00:53:30.189
of our youth and so on. But, um, but,

1104
00:53:30.199 --> 00:53:33.199
uh, I think that the most, the most convincing

1105
00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:36.270
piece of evidence for me was, uh, the, the

1106
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.449
overall rates of, of aggression and violent behavior in

1107
00:53:39.459 --> 00:53:42.149
society. If you look at the last 30 years,

1108
00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.320
they've basically gone on quite a steep decline, at

1109
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:49.860
least in, in developed societies. And it's, it's, it's

1110
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.860
hard to square that with the, obviously the huge

1111
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:55.409
growth in popularity in violent games. You know, if

1112
00:53:55.419 --> 00:53:57.360
they really were making people more violent, wouldn't we

1113
00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.790
have seen exactly the opposite that, that rates of

1114
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.979
interpersonal aggression would have gone up. So if anything,

1115
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:05.370
they may, it, it more tends to support the

1116
00:54:05.379 --> 00:54:07.969
kind of the, the opposite theory, which is that

1117
00:54:07.979 --> 00:54:09.889
there can be an outlet for aggression and actually

1118
00:54:09.899 --> 00:54:12.629
people can work off the the frustrations on these

1119
00:54:12.639 --> 00:54:16.449
games instead of being aggressive in interpersonal ways. Uh

1120
00:54:16.459 --> 00:54:20.560
And I think that another convincing piece of data

1121
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:25.360
is uh Ferguson's analysis of, of mass shooters where

1122
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:29.100
he shows that actually, um although some of them

1123
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.850
played, uh uh you know, uh first person shooter

1124
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.969
video games, this is if anything lower than the

1125
00:54:35.979 --> 00:54:39.560
rate in the general population. So again, that supports

1126
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.649
the theory that no, maybe that these things are

1127
00:54:41.659 --> 00:54:44.820
actually if anything helping people deal with their aggression

1128
00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.100
and not, and, and it's the people who, who

1129
00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.000
avoid them, who may actually uh in some cases

1130
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.729
are more problems. So, um I think the only

1131
00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:56.030
way that it, it's plausible that they may have

1132
00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:00.080
an effect is perhaps by improving the accuracy. So,

1133
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:02.270
if people have that should be nothing because it's

1134
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.719
quite serious. But if, if people have been, uh,

1135
00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:07.479
uh, practicing a lot of first person shooter games,

1136
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.929
if they're in an actual mass shooting situation, they

1137
00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:12.169
may actually kill more people because they're just used

1138
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:14.719
to, more used to, to pressing the trigger, aiming

1139
00:55:14.729 --> 00:55:18.429
and firing. But that doesn't really seem worth kind

1140
00:55:18.439 --> 00:55:22.360
of focusing legislation on in, in contrast with maybe

1141
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:26.169
restricting the availability of, of, of weapons to people

1142
00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:27.979
who are mentally unstable and that sort of thing.

1143
00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:32.110
Yeah. Uh So we've already touched a little bit

1144
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:37.090
on pornography earlier, but apart from the addiction side

1145
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:41.600
of things, what about some of its other supposed

1146
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.979
harmful effects on people's sexual lives? I mean, does

1147
00:55:44.989 --> 00:55:46.959
it have any or

1148
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:52.600
again another controversial subject? Uh And one that's difficult

1149
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.520
to, there's a lot of people arguing very, very

1150
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:59.370
different things. Uh And the other great difficulty with

1151
00:55:59.379 --> 00:56:03.510
investigating pornography, particularly with adolescence is it's there's a

1152
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.830
real lack of studies on it. Um PARTICULARLY with

1153
00:56:07.199 --> 00:56:10.060
underage people because there are obviously ethical, huge ethical

1154
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:14.429
difficulties with doing. So there's some questionnaire based studies.

1155
00:56:14.439 --> 00:56:15.979
But when at the level of, you know, in

1156
00:56:15.989 --> 00:56:20.110
depth interviews or, and especially experimental studies, I mean,

1157
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.030
it basically just can't, there's no way in an

1158
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.610
experimental situation that you can show pornographic material to

1159
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.500
a minor even though that we know that most

1160
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.610
particularly underage males most underage males above about 14

1161
00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.060
years of age are watching pornography all the time,

1162
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:39.129
but you can't actually study the effects of it

1163
00:56:39.139 --> 00:56:41.139
in a lab. So that does lead to huge

1164
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:45.679
kind of evidence. Uh, EVIDENCE gap really. Um, I

1165
00:56:45.689 --> 00:56:48.979
think there are some legitimate concerns there. Um, THERE'S

1166
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:52.699
not a huge, uh, as with screen time and,

1167
00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:56.010
and violent video games, there's not really much evidence

1168
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.340
or depression as well. There's not really much evidence

1169
00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.919
that, you know, say watching a certain number of

1170
00:57:00.929 --> 00:57:05.709
hours per week, more than another person really uh

1171
00:57:05.719 --> 00:57:07.870
affects your sex life or anything else in, in

1172
00:57:07.879 --> 00:57:10.110
any other way. I I think one of the

1173
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.270
concerns with adolescents in particular is though, is that

1174
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.229
they might be getting a lot of their sexual

1175
00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:19.770
education basically from porn, which obviously is a concern

1176
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:24.090
because porn is not particularly realistic in his depiction

1177
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.270
of real sexual relationships. So there is some evidence

1178
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.070
from positive studies that they may uh that young

1179
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.889
boys or adolescent boys may be pressuring sexual partners

1180
00:57:36.899 --> 00:57:40.679
into repeating certain things that they've seen online. And

1181
00:57:40.689 --> 00:57:42.939
this obviously can be quite distressing for the girls

1182
00:57:42.949 --> 00:57:46.129
and lead to frustrations in the relationship. And it's

1183
00:57:46.139 --> 00:57:48.610
not a particularly positive thing in terms of their,

1184
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.610
in terms of their sort of learning romantic relationships

1185
00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.620
and so on. So I think that is a

1186
00:57:54.629 --> 00:57:56.120
genuine extent. I don't think we should sort of

1187
00:57:56.129 --> 00:57:59.520
dismiss that concern out of hand because it's very,

1188
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.570
it because of it, because of the ethical problems,

1189
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.449
it's impossible to show that that doesn't have harmful

1190
00:58:04.459 --> 00:58:06.189
effects. Right. So we can't be sure that it

1191
00:58:06.199 --> 00:58:08.300
doesn't have harmful effects. So I don't think we

1192
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.909
should just dismiss that sort of concern, but in

1193
00:58:10.919 --> 00:58:14.260
terms of things like, uh, you know, more severe

1194
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:17.000
problems like sexual assault, there isn't really any hard

1195
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:21.649
evidence that, um, most porn use will affect rates

1196
00:58:21.659 --> 00:58:23.469
of sexual assault, which is sometimes, you know, kind

1197
00:58:23.479 --> 00:58:26.290
of a criticism of fem of some feminists, not

1198
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.820
all feminists, but that some feminists will make of

1199
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.679
a p some feminists are actually quite prop use,

1200
00:58:31.689 --> 00:58:34.199
but some will make the criticism that, you know,

1201
00:58:34.209 --> 00:58:36.489
it could, it could lead to more sexual violence,

1202
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.189
more sexual assault. There isn't much evidence for that

1203
00:58:39.199 --> 00:58:42.129
except in some studies, I did notice when they

1204
00:58:42.139 --> 00:58:44.899
focused on violent porn use, they did seem in

1205
00:58:44.909 --> 00:58:47.209
some of the meta analysis when they kind of

1206
00:58:47.219 --> 00:58:50.050
controlled for that. It did seem that that might

1207
00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.840
be again, maybe not causal but maybe a warning

1208
00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:55.669
sign. Uh IF someone is, is watching a lot

1209
00:58:55.679 --> 00:58:57.610
of of violent porn that they may be a

1210
00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.330
possible possible offender.

1211
00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:03.250
So if I remember correctly in the conversation I

1212
00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.570
had with Doctor Nicole Rosy again. Um I think

1213
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:09.679
that when I asked her if porn could have

1214
00:59:09.689 --> 00:59:15.159
any harmful psychological effects or harm relationship specifically. And

1215
00:59:15.169 --> 00:59:19.820
here we're focusing mostly on heterosexual relationships. She said

1216
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:24.419
that it could have a negative effects in the

1217
00:59:24.429 --> 00:59:29.695
sense that if the, if, for example, the, the

1218
00:59:29.705 --> 00:59:34.895
man is watching pornography and then, uh, his partner

1219
00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:38.014
knows, then the woman might get a little bit

1220
00:59:38.024 --> 00:59:41.895
insecure because of the, let's say the kinds of

1221
00:59:41.905 --> 00:59:47.165
women, uh, the, the, uh, her partner is exposed

1222
00:59:47.175 --> 00:59:49.764
to. So, I mean, she might get in insecure

1223
00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:53.685
because she doesn't look like them, she doesn't perform

1224
00:59:53.695 --> 00:59:56.655
like them and stuff like that. So that's something

1225
00:59:56.665 --> 00:59:57.804
that she mentioned

1226
00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:01.290
or even see it as cheating. I'm sure some

1227
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.159
women um do do see it as a kind

1228
01:00:04.169 --> 01:00:06.320
of as a kind of cheating uh or some

1229
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.199
men. That's why I think as well that um

1230
01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:10.429
it's not only with religious people that you might

1231
01:00:10.439 --> 01:00:13.370
get uh kind of kind of negative feelings about

1232
01:00:13.379 --> 01:00:17.250
porn news because you could have someone who feels

1233
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.120
like, you know, compelled to watch porn, but at

1234
01:00:19.129 --> 01:00:20.790
the same time, they feel like they're kind of

1235
01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.310
cheating on their partner by doing it. So I

1236
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.719
think you need, you do need to look at

1237
01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:27.290
the complexity of the, of the social relationship. On

1238
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.030
the other hand, you do get couples um who

1239
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.879
will watch porn together and enjoy it. So it,

1240
01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:34.969
it does very much depend on the, on the,

1241
01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:37.949
on the social context and that's why it's difficult

1242
01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:41.040
to really find patterns in the quantitative data because

1243
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:43.689
you're kind of averaging a whole lot of positive,

1244
01:00:43.699 --> 01:00:46.580
negative, neutral situations and there's, there's just not much

1245
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.350
signal in the data.

1246
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:51.030
So one thing also that I would like to

1247
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.790
ask you about is uh privacy. Of course, this

1248
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.189
is something that, for example, people work in the

1249
01:00:57.199 --> 01:01:00.129
ethics of technology, talk a lot about. But that's

1250
01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:04.020
from a philosophical perspective, but from a more psychological

1251
01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:09.540
perspective, are there risks to privacy associated with content

1252
01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:10.209
sharing?

1253
01:01:12.159 --> 01:01:15.870
Um I think obviously there, there are a lot

1254
01:01:15.879 --> 01:01:19.159
of risks. Um And there's a lot been written

1255
01:01:19.169 --> 01:01:22.639
about them. Uh The one in terms of, of

1256
01:01:22.649 --> 01:01:24.679
picking out one of the things that really stood

1257
01:01:24.689 --> 01:01:26.149
out to me when it was, when I was

1258
01:01:26.159 --> 01:01:27.889
doing a lot of reading for the, for the

1259
01:01:27.899 --> 01:01:29.870
book. Uh And I remember it is kind of

1260
01:01:29.879 --> 01:01:31.639
one of the most kind of distressing things I

1261
01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:34.310
was reading about uh in connection with privacy in

1262
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.370
particular was uh revenge porn. So there are some

1263
01:01:38.379 --> 01:01:44.060
really horrifying stories um of, of, you know, women

1264
01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.770
who, who'd had stuff shared, including by, you know,

1265
01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:48.830
their current husband and, and, and this sort of

1266
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.560
thing. So it really brought home that a lot

1267
01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:55.290
of the debate about privacy and people being exploited

1268
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.149
online through having open privacy and this sort of

1269
01:01:58.159 --> 01:02:00.639
thing. It, it's kind of missing the point, which

1270
01:02:00.649 --> 01:02:02.810
is a lot of this online abuse is, is

1271
01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.669
by uh people who, who know you, right? So,

1272
01:02:06.709 --> 01:02:08.610
uh es especially in the, in the case of

1273
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.709
women, it tends to be by ex-partners or even

1274
01:02:11.719 --> 01:02:15.709
current partners Uh and so to me, I, I

1275
01:02:15.719 --> 01:02:18.679
would tend to, to actually, I think there's a

1276
01:02:18.689 --> 01:02:22.429
lot being written about privacy. I think teens and

1277
01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.340
young people these days are actually very conscious of

1278
01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:26.419
privacy. They kind of grow up like it. Like

1279
01:02:26.429 --> 01:02:28.379
we were saying, at the start, they're very concerned

1280
01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:31.250
naturally about their reputation. So they very quickly learn

1281
01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.070
and, you know, they're very savvy about the controls

1282
01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.280
and things. They very quickly learn how to restrict

1283
01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:39.100
content to certain people and so on. Um I

1284
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:41.239
would, I would say that we should focus more

1285
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:45.229
on abuse by, you know, within social relationships and

1286
01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:49.350
really, you know, criminalize more that kind of online

1287
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.429
abuse, you know, sharing images without someone's consent, uh

1288
01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:56.489
you know, very delicate, uh very sensitive images without

1289
01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.780
someone, someone's consent is something that has been criminalized

1290
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:04.899
in certain jurisdictions, but it's still very piecemeal in,

1291
01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:07.449
in terms of, of where it's illegal, where not.

1292
01:03:07.739 --> 01:03:09.820
Uh And I think we really need to reach

1293
01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:12.840
more in, in international standards on, on dealing with

1294
01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.760
that as a, as a kind of crime, almost

1295
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:18.310
equivalent to in-person sexual abuse.

1296
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.889
Yeah, when it comes to the criminology side of

1297
01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:26.129
things, that's actually a recurrent theme about how many

1298
01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:29.790
types of abuse out there online and offline actually

1299
01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.610
occur between uh people that have a, a close

1300
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.469
relationship than between strangers.

1301
01:03:37.729 --> 01:03:40.370
Exactly. Exactly. And, and, and so privacy is kind

1302
01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:43.479
of irrelevant because you trust that person, you share

1303
01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:45.870
things with them and, and then, you know, the

1304
01:03:45.879 --> 01:03:49.129
relationship goes so, and suddenly they, they, they're really,

1305
01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:50.780
uh kind of abusing you online. So,

1306
01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.760
so, uh another thing that sometimes people worry about

1307
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:59.570
is the negative effects that the use of technology

1308
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.679
might have on education. But actually, uh what do

1309
01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:08.879
we know about? Perhaps the advantages that, uh, the

1310
01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:13.679
lessons Children can take uh from new technologies because

1311
01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:15.560
the, there are some. Right.

1312
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:18.629
Yeah. II, I would love to see more research

1313
01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:20.489
on that and, and in general on the, um

1314
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.399
I think a lot of the debate has focused

1315
01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:26.610
on the negative aspects of internet use. You know,

1316
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.689
I, I came of age in the, in the

1317
01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:31.209
nineties, there was a lot of optimism about, about

1318
01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:33.389
the internet. And sometimes I wonder where did all

1319
01:04:33.399 --> 01:04:35.570
that go? Now all you hear is like, oh,

1320
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.120
the internet is making people depressed, is making people

1321
01:04:39.129 --> 01:04:42.770
suicidal, et cetera, et cetera. And, and it's, well,

1322
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.179
you know, it has, it still has a lot

1323
01:04:44.189 --> 01:04:45.929
of potential. I think it still has an incredible

1324
01:04:45.939 --> 01:04:49.100
potential for bringing, bringing people together. Uh AND one

1325
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.600
of the ways you can see that quite clearly

1326
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.949
is in, in education, um the problem is a

1327
01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:56.669
lot of the research has been on educational intervention.

1328
01:04:56.679 --> 01:04:59.379
So someone will say, well, you know, we used

1329
01:04:59.389 --> 01:05:02.439
a Facebook group in my classroom to teach a

1330
01:05:02.449 --> 01:05:05.229
foreign language and, and this sort of thing and

1331
01:05:05.239 --> 01:05:07.389
really what I think is lacking is, is an

1332
01:05:07.399 --> 01:05:11.679
understanding of the, you know, the basic research of

1333
01:05:11.689 --> 01:05:15.899
how uh students uh including both high school students

1334
01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:19.129
and, and university students that are really using technology

1335
01:05:19.139 --> 01:05:21.689
to help their learning. Because with my other hat,

1336
01:05:21.699 --> 01:05:23.770
as a, as a university teacher, I really noticed

1337
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.169
that students will use technology in a way that

1338
01:05:27.179 --> 01:05:29.399
wasn't really available to me when I was at,

1339
01:05:29.409 --> 01:05:32.090
at college. So they will have a whatsapp group

1340
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.540
when they have like a group assignment, have a

1341
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.169
whatsapp group and they will kind of allocate the

1342
01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:37.770
tasks out. And so they're really using technology in

1343
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.370
a very organic way to kinda share the knowledge

1344
01:05:40.379 --> 01:05:41.989
in their, in their social group and help the

1345
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.939
learning. And there's some evidence this may even sort

1346
01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:47.139
of flatten out some of the differences in in

1347
01:05:47.149 --> 01:05:49.810
attainment. So, you know, the the great majority of

1348
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.320
the class is actually reaching a, a kind of

1349
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.020
slightly higher level than they would have before before

1350
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:59.459
technology. And they're really just, just AAA lack of

1351
01:05:59.469 --> 01:06:01.580
basic research on, on how students are doing that

1352
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.979
and and whether it's possible for us to work

1353
01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:06.399
with that because we tend to just as, as

1354
01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:08.560
university teachers and I'm sure even more as high

1355
01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:12.239
school teachers just ignore this kind of back channel

1356
01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:14.520
behind the scenes learning that's taken place in the

1357
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:16.889
social groups. And if there's some way that you

1358
01:06:16.899 --> 01:06:18.629
could kind of tap into that and kind of

1359
01:06:18.639 --> 01:06:21.949
help certain students lead sort of mini groups and

1360
01:06:21.959 --> 01:06:24.649
use technology to kind of mentor other students I

1361
01:06:24.659 --> 01:06:26.949
think could be really, really interesting. But I've never

1362
01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:29.899
really seen any research but just looking into the

1363
01:06:29.909 --> 01:06:31.699
the kind of basic social interest because it's so

1364
01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:34.149
private, right? A lot, a lot of this social

1365
01:06:34.159 --> 01:06:36.429
network use, especially with something like whatsapp is just,

1366
01:06:36.899 --> 01:06:39.110
it's just really hidden and, and really difficult together.

1367
01:06:40.199 --> 01:06:43.340
So let's talk a little bit about online dating

1368
01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:46.750
apps. That's something that people in recent years like.

1369
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:54.320
Yeah, sure. So are there also any important gender

1370
01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:57.500
differences here in terms of uh its use?

1371
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.669
Yeah. Again, um we're in uh I did a

1372
01:07:02.679 --> 01:07:06.219
study myself on Tinder with actually some, it was

1373
01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:08.409
driven by some undergraduate students who wanted to do,

1374
01:07:08.419 --> 01:07:10.040
like uh we kind of developed a lot of

1375
01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:14.350
their, their uh their sort of semester project and

1376
01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.199
um uh with my, with my long term collaborator,

1377
01:07:17.209 --> 01:07:19.620
Antonio Oliveira de Rosa as well, who has been

1378
01:07:19.629 --> 01:07:22.810
a really, really good collaborator with me. Um So

1379
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.110
we had some evolutionary hypotheses, not all of them

1380
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.149
were, were supportive, but um some of them were,

1381
01:07:28.159 --> 01:07:31.179
were pretty well supported. So, uh if you look

1382
01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:34.350
at um the photos that people are posting on

1383
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.429
Tinder, women tended to show off basically their whole

1384
01:07:37.439 --> 01:07:40.810
body. So sort of advertising, if you wanna take

1385
01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.959
a kind of a kind of traditional evolutionary psychology

1386
01:07:43.969 --> 01:07:45.639
approach, it's easier to see why they want to

1387
01:07:45.649 --> 01:07:47.939
sort of might want to sort of advertise that

1388
01:07:47.949 --> 01:07:51.639
sort of aspect of their fitness. Whereas men were

1389
01:07:51.649 --> 01:07:54.250
really, were not showing the, I mean, women do

1390
01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.159
things that use the, the mirror selfies so that

1391
01:07:56.169 --> 01:07:57.860
they use a mirror to show their whole body.

1392
01:07:57.979 --> 01:08:00.850
Um, MIRROR selfies are quite a, uh, my, my,

1393
01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.209
my wife actually told me off once for, for

1394
01:08:03.219 --> 01:08:06.520
posting on myself. She said no, only girls do

1395
01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:09.429
that, only girls and gay men do that basically.

1396
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.570
So, you know, it's um it, it, it's, it's

1397
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.120
not something that men tend to do if you

1398
01:08:14.129 --> 01:08:15.739
look at the sort of photos that men were,

1399
01:08:15.985 --> 01:08:18.604
I think tend to be just the face or

1400
01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:20.765
um if it was the whole body, it was

1401
01:08:20.774 --> 01:08:23.035
with something like cuddling a dog or something, you

1402
01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:24.305
know, to show, you know, I have a nice

1403
01:08:24.314 --> 01:08:25.104
kind of sensitive

1404
01:08:25.115 --> 01:08:28.564
or perhaps more focused on the upper body,

1405
01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.734
right? Yeah, maybe a bit more on the upper

1406
01:08:30.745 --> 01:08:32.384
body but not, you know, so much showing the

1407
01:08:32.395 --> 01:08:36.805
body more themselves with something. So for example, with

1408
01:08:36.814 --> 01:08:40.634
a nice car or with the Eiffel Tower, you

1409
01:08:40.645 --> 01:08:43.075
know, just showing you can think of it as

1410
01:08:43.084 --> 01:08:46.490
showing their resources, right? So travel, travel is like,

1411
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.229
I've got the resources to go off to another

1412
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.649
country and, and take a picture of myself there

1413
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.120
or maybe getting a university degree, that sort of

1414
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:56.270
thing. And also they tended to include more text.

1415
01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.830
So they would have more information about their educational

1416
01:08:58.839 --> 01:09:02.629
background. I'm an engineer or their profession, you know,

1417
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.000
their, their current job basically. Um, WHAT I'd be

1418
01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.310
really interested in looking at and there was a

1419
01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:11.479
study out a couple of months ago on the

1420
01:09:11.488 --> 01:09:14.679
linguistic uh interaction. So I think there's even more

1421
01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:18.219
differences once the match has been made, um, there's

1422
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:20.608
a lot of differences between, you know, who's kind

1423
01:09:20.618 --> 01:09:23.488
of leading the conversation, that sort of thing and,

1424
01:09:23.499 --> 01:09:26.008
and the kind of different linguistic strategies that maybe

1425
01:09:26.179 --> 01:09:28.068
the two sides have. But again, this is quite

1426
01:09:28.078 --> 01:09:30.508
hidden. So there isn't a lot of a lot

1427
01:09:30.519 --> 01:09:31.398
of evidence on them.

1428
01:09:32.019 --> 01:09:36.139
Yeah. But uh do we see any changes uh

1429
01:09:36.148 --> 01:09:41.639
as young people gain more experience interacting with potential

1430
01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:45.738
partners in terms of their behavior in online dating

1431
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:46.238
apps?

1432
01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:49.629
I think this is, this is definitely like a

1433
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.459
topic for for future research and future research needs

1434
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:55.830
to look at. I think the key question here

1435
01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:58.359
is how will the new normal of online dating?

1436
01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:01.490
Because there's evidence that it has almost become the

1437
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.990
norm and almost the majority of people meet, meet

1438
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.390
new romantic partners online and how will it affect

1439
01:10:08.399 --> 01:10:11.430
the the process of gaining experience of of gender

1440
01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:13.890
partners? Are people going to have more partners on

1441
01:10:13.899 --> 01:10:15.640
average before they settle down? I think that would

1442
01:10:15.649 --> 01:10:18.680
be quite a reasonable hypothesis, but we, we just

1443
01:10:18.689 --> 01:10:20.990
don't know at the moment whether online dating is

1444
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.359
going to gonna lead to people taking longer going

1445
01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:27.450
through this bigger kind of potential market of, of,

1446
01:10:27.459 --> 01:10:30.520
of partners before they settle on a long term

1447
01:10:30.529 --> 01:10:33.000
partner. And also there's a question of if you

1448
01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:35.040
meet your partner online, does that mean you're more

1449
01:10:35.049 --> 01:10:39.080
likely to start looking around when you become dissatisfied

1450
01:10:39.089 --> 01:10:40.839
with your partner? Thinking? Well, I met them online.

1451
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.669
There were loads of others that I could have

1452
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.669
ended up with. So maybe I'll go and take

1453
01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.919
a look at this. I could end up with

1454
01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:48.399
someone better if I if I go back to

1455
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:51.479
the online market. So it's very difficult to answer

1456
01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:54.560
those questions because really you need, we, we need

1457
01:10:54.569 --> 01:10:57.330
to start looking at and I'm not really aware

1458
01:10:57.339 --> 01:11:00.279
of any really long term longitudinal studies in this

1459
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.149
area, but that's what you need to really answer

1460
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.390
those questions is kind of large scale long term

1461
01:11:05.399 --> 01:11:08.790
longitudinal studies which are very costly and, and obviously

1462
01:11:08.799 --> 01:11:10.609
time consuming to work out.

1463
01:11:11.109 --> 01:11:14.080
But at least at this moment, I mean, when

1464
01:11:14.089 --> 01:11:18.410
you hear perhaps some more conservative people claiming that

1465
01:11:18.419 --> 01:11:24.169
perhaps uh online dating apps promote hookup culture and

1466
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:28.270
uh short term relationships. I mean, at least as

1467
01:11:28.279 --> 01:11:31.569
far as we know, I mean, we don't know

1468
01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.939
actually. Right. I, I

1469
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:36.040
think, I think it's a reasonable with like with

1470
01:11:36.049 --> 01:11:37.029
a lot of these things, I think it's a

1471
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.620
reasonable hypothesis, but you can also see the political

1472
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:43.520
reasons they would have for saying that. So sure,

1473
01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.509
I think, yeah, but so like I tend to

1474
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.439
get dissatisfied with people who, who just have a

1475
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:52.669
knee jerk response. So, ah, no, that's crap. You

1476
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.680
know, because I, I think they're just responding to

1477
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:56.720
the politics mostly and I think it is a

1478
01:11:56.729 --> 01:12:00.439
reasonable hypothesis but actually answering the question would be,

1479
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:04.180
would, would be very time consuming and costly to

1480
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.859
do properly.

1481
01:12:05.649 --> 01:12:08.939
And so, uh, and there are, there also cultural

1482
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:11.870
and personality differences to consider here.

1483
01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:16.580
Um, Again, this is, I think this is one

1484
01:12:16.589 --> 01:12:20.120
mostly for it. It's amazing. I mean, there is

1485
01:12:20.129 --> 01:12:22.729
a lot of research on online dating, but a

1486
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.129
lot of it just seems to be kind of

1487
01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.620
scratching the surface so you can get, you know,

1488
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:29.950
online dating in Turkey, online dating in the Philippines,

1489
01:12:29.959 --> 01:12:32.370
whatever. But there's a little, there, there's very little

1490
01:12:32.379 --> 01:12:34.660
which is actually really putting everything together or say

1491
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:38.740
doing a systematic comparison between eight different countries. There

1492
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.890
just doesn't seem to be that kind of level

1493
01:12:40.899 --> 01:12:43.569
of, of analysis. But you would expect, yeah, there

1494
01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.129
would be a lot of, a lot of differences

1495
01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:48.790
also with personality. Again, I've seen very little in

1496
01:12:48.799 --> 01:12:51.759
personality, but you would imagine I would, I would

1497
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:54.049
predict that there would be a lot of personality

1498
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:57.930
differences. A problem there is obviously with self report.

1499
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.459
Um It's, if you're dealing with self report, there's

1500
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:03.569
gonna be a lot of bias. A lot of

1501
01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.669
social presentation bias. When you, when you're talking about

1502
01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.359
something like online dating, that's why with our study,

1503
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:12.310
we were more just based on analyzing the profiles

1504
01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:14.419
and the kind of differences in the profiles because

1505
01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:16.520
it, it's a sort of area where, where people

1506
01:13:16.529 --> 01:13:19.229
are gonna, gonna really bias their, their presentation of

1507
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.660
what they're doing quite a lot, I think.

1508
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:24.700
Well, well, actually one very interesting thing I talked

1509
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:29.609
about. I talked recently with, uh, an evolutionary psychologist

1510
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:35.160
from Brazil and he did work on uh behavior

1511
01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:38.845
in online dating apps in Brazil specifically. So I'm

1512
01:13:38.854 --> 01:13:42.165
not sure if this would generalize to other countries.

1513
01:13:42.174 --> 01:13:45.334
And he told me that at least people uh

1514
01:13:45.345 --> 01:13:49.714
online dating app users in Brazil tend to score

1515
01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:53.915
higher on socio sexuality than the non users.

1516
01:13:53.924 --> 01:13:59.674
Oh yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah, we definitely predict that

1517
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.265
uh we did a, did a study with Antonio

1518
01:14:02.274 --> 01:14:07.149
on, on socio sexuality as well um on how

1519
01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.169
people kind of evaluate different faces, but we didn't

1520
01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.029
kind of get, we didn't really support that there

1521
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.470
wasn't much difference basically in socio sexuality. But yeah,

1522
01:14:15.479 --> 01:14:18.160
we definitely, and I think our members, I don't

1523
01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:19.810
know if it was the same guy that you

1524
01:14:19.819 --> 01:14:22.220
were talking about. But I remember a study saying

1525
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:24.830
that showing that Tinder users were more likely to

1526
01:14:24.839 --> 01:14:28.250
score score highly on sos I, I think so

1527
01:14:28.259 --> 01:14:32.450
because um it's just that you're kind of you're

1528
01:14:32.459 --> 01:14:35.399
kind of looking for. Yeah, again, again, this is

1529
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:38.339
maybe sort of short term mating strategy based was

1530
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.069
a short term mating strategy isn't it? But then

1531
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.580
these days it's not, uh it's not uncommon to

1532
01:14:43.589 --> 01:14:45.370
uh to, to, to, you know, meet your, your

1533
01:14:45.379 --> 01:14:48.750
wife on Tinder. So it has become much more,

1534
01:14:48.759 --> 01:14:49.779
uh much more common.

1535
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.620
So, as I said earlier in our first conversation,

1536
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:57.419
we talked a lot about cyberbullying, but just to

1537
01:14:57.430 --> 01:15:00.720
perhaps recap uh a little bit what we talked

1538
01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:03.459
about back then and perhaps there's also five years

1539
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:07.120
on new information about it. So, in what ways

1540
01:15:07.129 --> 01:15:12.410
does it differ from offline bullying? Well, it can

1541
01:15:12.419 --> 01:15:12.930
be

1542
01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:15.009
um one of the ways that the difference differs

1543
01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.350
obviously is that you, you can always feel vulnerable

1544
01:15:18.359 --> 01:15:19.870
to it. I think that's one of the hardest

1545
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.339
aspects to deal with. Uh So if you receive

1546
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.419
a message at home where you, you're kind of

1547
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:27.580
used to feeling safe, you know, in your own

1548
01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.709
bedroom and then suddenly a message pops up on

1549
01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.270
your phone and you're, you're feeling bad. Th this

1550
01:15:32.279 --> 01:15:34.509
can be quite psychologically distressing, but I think they

1551
01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.069
can feel there's nowhere to get away from it.

1552
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:43.750
Um Another um another uh uh distressing aspect can

1553
01:15:43.759 --> 01:15:46.720
be the kind of online uh dog pal kind

1554
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:49.390
of thing where, where you get sort of uh

1555
01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:52.020
a lot of people engaging, sort of joining in

1556
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:54.709
piling on the, the bullying and, and that can

1557
01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.609
be one of the most distressing forms. So for

1558
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.410
example, if you have a video that's shared against

1559
01:15:59.419 --> 01:16:02.160
someone's will and then it goes viral and even

1560
01:16:02.169 --> 01:16:04.250
people who don't know you've never met, you are

1561
01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.850
kind of mocking you online. I think that can

1562
01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:09.589
be, be very distressing, particularly for adolescents who have

1563
01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.290
this kind of this bias to focus on the

1564
01:16:12.299 --> 01:16:14.810
reputation and how other people are, are evaluating them.

1565
01:16:14.819 --> 01:16:17.220
They, they're very vulnerable to that. On the other

1566
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:20.910
hand, there is, I've seen evidence that, um, not

1567
01:16:20.919 --> 01:16:24.209
everyone agrees that cyber you, the kind of image

1568
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.959
that the public image that presented of cyberbullying is

1569
01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:29.410
that it's almost worse than, than, than traditional good

1570
01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:32.290
old physical bullying. But actually, if you look at

1571
01:16:32.299 --> 01:16:36.009
uh, at victims a lot, particularly boys often tend

1572
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.089
to say that actually they find physical bullying worse

1573
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.620
because you have that uh you have the kind

1574
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:44.759
of physical fear factor. So the bigger boy is

1575
01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:46.540
slapping you around the head or whatever, you can

1576
01:16:46.549 --> 01:16:48.459
actually almost fear for your life a bit. You

1577
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.919
know, how far is this guy gonna go? You

1578
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:53.439
know, and it can be quite, quite intimidating. Whereas,

1579
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.919
you know, boys particularly will often take the, the

1580
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.520
cyber thing kinda, you know, they'll just ignore it,

1581
01:16:58.529 --> 01:17:01.549
just block the person, just ignore the messages. And

1582
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.259
then I, I think it depends a lot on,

1583
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.129
on the severity. Again, if, if lots of people

1584
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.540
are joining in and you feel lots of people

1585
01:17:06.549 --> 01:17:08.660
are ganging up on you online, that can maybe

1586
01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:11.379
be worse. But if it's just one idiot kind

1587
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:13.939
of sending you stupid messages it's just, you can,

1588
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:16.060
maybe it's not as damaging as people think it

1589
01:17:16.069 --> 01:17:18.879
is. So, I think in itself again, you got

1590
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:20.500
to look at the specifics of the act and

1591
01:17:20.509 --> 01:17:23.529
in itself it isn't necessarily more or less damaging,

1592
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:23.740
really.

1593
01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.109
Yeah. But perhaps one of the more complicated things

1594
01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.200
there would be that it's potentially something that would

1595
01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:34.709
go around 24 7. Right. Because, I mean, if

1596
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.680
it occurs at school, it only occurs when you're

1597
01:17:37.689 --> 01:17:41.709
there but if it's online it can occur anytime.

1598
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.930
Yeah, that,

1599
01:17:41.939 --> 01:17:43.799
that, that, yeah, like I was saying that that's

1600
01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:47.009
definitely, but it, it's kind of swinging some roundabouts

1601
01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.479
a bit because then you don't have usually at

1602
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.979
the same level of a physical threat. I think

1603
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.080
one of the, you know, one of the most

1604
01:17:53.089 --> 01:17:56.799
sinister things people can do is sometimes sort of

1605
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:01.430
turn the online physicals, I've heard cases of say,

1606
01:18:01.439 --> 01:18:05.560
delivering a pizza, uh, or, or delivering other things

1607
01:18:05.569 --> 01:18:08.009
to the person or the, um, or what do

1608
01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.660
they call it? The, the swap where they do

1609
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:12.879
the swatting. So then they actually like, uh, uh,

1610
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:15.879
um, say that they're suspecting someone of a serious

1611
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:18.240
crime and, and the, and the police can actually

1612
01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.700
send a swat team around and, you know, that,

1613
01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.020
that, that's when it, it, it, it, you know,

1614
01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:24.600
it may be the most sort of serious form

1615
01:18:24.609 --> 01:18:26.740
of online or the, or the kind of doxing

1616
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:31.770
where you're like, releasing someone's, uh, you know, with,

1617
01:18:31.779 --> 01:18:33.799
with, yeah, not so much with young people, but

1618
01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.689
you get that with, with old, with adults on,

1619
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.649
on Twitter and with, with someone who is sort

1620
01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.779
of famous or something like that. But um but

1621
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:43.879
yeah, the, the, you know, the, the, the kind,

1622
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:49.799
the kind of making the uh the that sort

1623
01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:51.830
of crossing the line between the virtual and physical

1624
01:18:51.839 --> 01:18:54.979
maybe can be quite intimidating thinking also maybe like

1625
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:58.399
sort of surveillance photos posting those that sort of

1626
01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:01.220
thing. So, you know, that that can be maybe

1627
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:02.790
where it becomes extremely threatening. Yeah.

1628
01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:07.439
So on a more positive note, now, what are

1629
01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:11.950
some of the benefits and opportunities on the internet

1630
01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:16.140
when it comes to intergroup and cross cultural contacts?

1631
01:19:17.939 --> 01:19:19.500
Well, I think uh with the, with the kind

1632
01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:23.700
of more anonymous forms of communication, text based communication,

1633
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:27.180
there's evidence that can be quite good for promoting

1634
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:31.479
intergroup contact uh in the early stages. Uh BECAUSE

1635
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:33.490
one of the problems, if you, if you kind

1636
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.680
of have two groups who've been engaged in conflict,

1637
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.520
say, you know, we've got obvious example at the

1638
01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:42.669
moment with uh with Jews and, and, and Palestinians

1639
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.009
in Israel where, you know, you can imagine at

1640
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.390
the moment, it would be be almost impossible to

1641
01:19:47.399 --> 01:19:48.950
get them in a room together. And if things

1642
01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:52.850
are quite um if things are very uh kind

1643
01:19:52.859 --> 01:19:56.419
of sensitive, you can actually get uh an unfortunate

1644
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:58.759
phenomenon when you try and get contact between groups

1645
01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:00.439
in the, in the offline world that they can

1646
01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:02.899
actually polarize and, and end up actually have a

1647
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:05.140
big argument and, and they come away almost. Uh

1648
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:07.290
THERE have been examples of workshops like that where

1649
01:20:07.299 --> 01:20:11.240
they, the groups unfortunately came away almost more polarized

1650
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:14.819
than they were before punta. So one, there is

1651
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:18.609
evidence that sometimes having the initial contact online because

1652
01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.109
it kind of removes the uh the kind of

1653
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.240
salience of the cultural differences. You know, you don't

1654
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.220
see the immediate visual difference that someone is wearing

1655
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:30.459
different clothes, different hairstyle or whatever. Uh And you

1656
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:31.919
can just kind of talk about the things that

1657
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.259
connect you. So you kind of have, I guess

1658
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.830
it's a bit like the sort of interactions and

1659
01:20:36.839 --> 01:20:40.100
online dating where you have the hyper personalization where

1660
01:20:40.109 --> 01:20:41.899
you tend to sort of see the positive aspects.

1661
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.279
So you can actually get that bias with the

1662
01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:47.509
intergroup communication as well. Um But I would say

1663
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.279
you probably do need to have physical to get

1664
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:51.439
a really true and group contact, you would need

1665
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.560
to have still need to have physical contact at

1666
01:20:54.569 --> 01:20:56.370
some point. Uh And I think it would be

1667
01:20:56.379 --> 01:20:59.549
interesting to think about um the use of video

1668
01:20:59.919 --> 01:21:01.910
uh video chat as a kind of halfway house.

1669
01:21:01.919 --> 01:21:04.649
So you could kind of start with text based

1670
01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.709
contact, then move to kind of having people have

1671
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.250
a big zoom meeting or something before you actually

1672
01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:12.330
bring them together and, and, and, and that could

1673
01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:14.839
be a way of ensuring that the physical contact

1674
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.430
is kind of safer because they've had all this

1675
01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:19.109
interaction by text and video beforehand.

1676
01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:24.270
So another thing now that I think is very

1677
01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:28.819
interesting from a psychological perspective is do we know

1678
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:35.470
in what ways interpersonal interactions online differ from offline

1679
01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:38.899
interactions? And, and I mean, if there are differences,

1680
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:42.515
do you think that for example, when certain people

1681
01:21:42.524 --> 01:21:46.435
worry that if someone spends too much time on

1682
01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:49.674
the internet, even if they are interacting with other

1683
01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:53.575
people on social gaming, for example, that that might

1684
01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:57.714
damage their social skills because they are not interacting

1685
01:21:57.785 --> 01:22:02.750
face to face. For example, I think that's become

1686
01:22:02.759 --> 01:22:06.609
less of a concern as the interactions become more

1687
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.270
immersive. So these days, we have to, you have

1688
01:22:09.279 --> 01:22:14.200
to really distinguishing text based audio video communication. Um

1689
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:15.819
I really think, you know, it's not all the

1690
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:18.430
same thing. Uh And, and a lot of the

1691
01:22:18.439 --> 01:22:21.750
classic studies from the early days of cyber psychology

1692
01:22:21.759 --> 01:22:23.089
can almost seem a bit out of date because

1693
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.629
they focused on text based online communication. So they

1694
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.899
say, you know, it's more anonymous, it's more asynchronous,

1695
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:34.890
particularly the asynchrony now doesn't seem much of a

1696
01:22:34.899 --> 01:22:38.540
factor uh at all because, you know, we're all

1697
01:22:38.549 --> 01:22:42.569
used to like immediate responses by whatsapp video calls.

1698
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:47.500
So this idea that um you had theories like

1699
01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:52.180
reduced cues theory, uh hyper personalization, which I think

1700
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:54.839
don't apply nearly as much to, to video based

1701
01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:58.779
uh communication. So I think before you jump to

1702
01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:01.060
conclusions about the effects, you should sort of see

1703
01:23:01.069 --> 01:23:04.310
how someone is usually interacting online. If they're doing

1704
01:23:04.319 --> 01:23:06.549
it in a text based way, then you might

1705
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.709
still have concerns about the social skills, about the

1706
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.850
idealization of the people they meet online, et cetera.

1707
01:23:13.109 --> 01:23:16.430
But uh I noticed, for example, uh when, when

1708
01:23:16.439 --> 01:23:19.759
my sons are playing uh you know, games like

1709
01:23:19.770 --> 01:23:24.759
valorant or Overwatch, they usually communicating by voice. And

1710
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:26.910
they, you know, it seems to me that that

1711
01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:30.430
is could be pretty uh pretty useful as actually

1712
01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:32.620
a way of kind of learning to work in

1713
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:34.910
a group, learning to develop a strategy together. It's

1714
01:23:34.919 --> 01:23:36.310
not some, not the kind of experience that I

1715
01:23:36.319 --> 01:23:38.180
had as a as a teenager and it might

1716
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:40.100
have been quite useful for me in terms of

1717
01:23:40.109 --> 01:23:42.609
developing my social skills if I was able to,

1718
01:23:42.759 --> 01:23:44.390
to look at working in a team like that.

1719
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.660
So it's not at all the case that online

1720
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:53.700
people cannot develop their social skills, right? They, they

1721
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:55.859
can at least in certain context.

1722
01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.339
Yeah, I mean, again, I think as, as in

1723
01:23:58.350 --> 01:24:00.029
a lot of these areas, the hard evidence is

1724
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.910
really lacking. But I think potentially um you know,

1725
01:24:04.919 --> 01:24:07.500
it, it it's maybe not, not to the same

1726
01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.490
extent as if they're regularly playing in a football

1727
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:14.660
team, but it's very different from, from the kind

1728
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:19.459
of image how, how people, how teenage boys do

1729
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:21.959
gaming these days, I think is very different from

1730
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:24.640
the traditional image of a nerd kind of sitting

1731
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:26.240
in the basement. I think there's a lot more

1732
01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:29.520
social act interaction than, than older people might realize

1733
01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:29.919
going on.

1734
01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:34.169
And so uh I think that you, you've already

1735
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:37.890
sort of answered this earlier, but uh looking at

1736
01:24:37.899 --> 01:24:42.200
most of the risks that people tend to associate

1737
01:24:42.209 --> 01:24:46.759
with the internet technologies. Do you think that overall

1738
01:24:46.799 --> 01:24:49.160
they are exaggerated or

1739
01:24:49.169 --> 01:24:54.609
not? I think it depends uh on uh on

1740
01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.109
the group. I mean, just by the general public,

1741
01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.890
I would say, yeah, probably there is some exaggeration.

1742
01:25:00.899 --> 01:25:06.979
Um YOU know, just iiii I sometimes have slight

1743
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:10.899
arguments with my wife about her daughter's screen news.

1744
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:12.399
She's like, I don't know, she's like stuck at

1745
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.180
her phone all the time and it's like, well,

1746
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:17.660
so are we, you know, so it, it seems

1747
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:20.000
straight. Why do people worry so much about again?

1748
01:25:20.009 --> 01:25:23.029
It's this kind of protection of overprotection of Children

1749
01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:26.069
thinking about them as particularly vulnerable to these cultural

1750
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:28.390
influences, I think, which is quite natural. But why

1751
01:25:28.399 --> 01:25:30.759
are particularly worried about Children and adolescents and they're

1752
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:32.839
not worried about adults using cell phones all the

1753
01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:34.919
time, you know. So it, it, I think it

1754
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.680
is, it is the new normal and, and you

1755
01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:40.250
know, it's not going away. So I think there

1756
01:25:40.259 --> 01:25:42.770
is an exaggeration of, of the risk by older

1757
01:25:42.779 --> 01:25:46.859
generations. But in terms of some of the scientists,

1758
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.890
I think, do downplay the risks, maybe a bit

1759
01:25:48.899 --> 01:25:52.129
more than, than they should do. Uh ESPECIALLY in

1760
01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.620
more informal communications, as I was saying, like on,

1761
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:58.140
on Twitter and so on. And um especially policy,

1762
01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:02.600
I would like to see more attention being paid

1763
01:26:02.609 --> 01:26:06.100
by policymakers and in terms of not just leaving

1764
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:08.229
everything to the market, but actually thinking, you know,

1765
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.000
how can we influence without destroying people's freedom of

1766
01:26:11.009 --> 01:26:14.049
speech? But how can we maybe kind of nudge

1767
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.649
or, or tilt the kind of online experience so

1768
01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.220
that it is a bit more positive for people.

1769
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:20.810
And I think there is people are starting to

1770
01:26:20.819 --> 01:26:23.220
look at an example would be the five rights

1771
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:27.879
foundation uh Sonia Livingstone, uh professor at LSE in

1772
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:30.770
London. Um It's been really involved in setting that

1773
01:26:30.779 --> 01:26:34.560
up and they're really like pressuring governments to kind

1774
01:26:34.569 --> 01:26:37.020
of work with the industry to kind of create

1775
01:26:37.029 --> 01:26:39.680
a safer environment for kids online. But they uh

1776
01:26:39.689 --> 01:26:42.709
yeah, there, there, there needs to be more of

1777
01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.950
that. I think more, more governments really trying to

1778
01:26:44.959 --> 01:26:47.839
trying to influence the experience that kids are having

1779
01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:48.160
online.

1780
01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.660
Uh And with the goal of in mind of

1781
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:55.790
financing adolescents, well being, what would you say are

1782
01:26:55.799 --> 01:27:01.120
perhaps some of the messages guidelines that people should

1783
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:04.109
take from your book when it comes to communicating

1784
01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.500
about potential online risks, identifying, for example, at risk

1785
01:27:09.509 --> 01:27:11.439
individuals and so on.

1786
01:27:12.459 --> 01:27:15.870
I think, I think it's difficult because as I

1787
01:27:15.879 --> 01:27:19.080
was saying, adolescents often do, um, they kind of

1788
01:27:19.089 --> 01:27:20.700
withdraw from their parents. But I think this is

1789
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:23.100
quite natural and you don't as a parent, you

1790
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:25.720
know, I've got a 20 year old, uh, and

1791
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:27.540
an 18 year old as well as a six

1792
01:27:27.549 --> 01:27:31.859
year old and, and I don't know, I can't

1793
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:34.589
honestly say I've had, you know, I'm vaguely aware

1794
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.620
of what my sons do online but I haven't

1795
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:38.600
had many kind of in depth conversations. So I

1796
01:27:38.609 --> 01:27:40.310
have to hold my hand up and, and, and

1797
01:27:40.319 --> 01:27:42.479
admit that, but I think you need try and

1798
01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.490
be aware of, you know, what sort of, you

1799
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.430
know, I know what games they like, we have

1800
01:27:46.439 --> 01:27:49.580
conversations about that sort of thing. Um So try

1801
01:27:49.589 --> 01:27:50.779
and be aware of, you know, what sort of

1802
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:53.549
things they're into online. At least I do think

1803
01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.609
though. But as I was saying, I, I think

1804
01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.810
a lot of responsibilities is put on to parents

1805
01:27:58.819 --> 01:28:01.490
and, and this is maybe this kind of individualistic

1806
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.919
Western society kind of thing. We, we obviously don't

1807
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:06.439
want to go all the way to kind of

1808
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:10.830
China model totally controlling people's internet life. But I

1809
01:28:10.839 --> 01:28:13.049
do one of the things I suggest um at

1810
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.899
the end of the book is to do with

1811
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:18.629
algorithms, you know, the the companies like Meta and

1812
01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.720
Google use all these algorithms to kind of control

1813
01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:24.089
what they're showing to us. But it's very much

1814
01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:27.350
just sort of market driven driven by advertisers, sponsored

1815
01:28:27.359 --> 01:28:30.040
content and so on. I think they could be

1816
01:28:30.049 --> 01:28:32.060
doing more and I think they are starting to

1817
01:28:32.069 --> 01:28:33.319
do this but they could be doing more with

1818
01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:35.399
algorithms to actually make the internet a bit of

1819
01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:38.669
a safer environment. I'm very surprised sometimes when I,

1820
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.270
when my daughter, my six year old daughter is

1821
01:28:40.279 --> 01:28:42.649
watching youtube and some of the things that pop

1822
01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:46.180
up in recommendations that's not appropriate for a six

1823
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:47.930
year old kid to be watching. You know, and

1824
01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:52.830
so, you know, surely we have enough sophisticated, enough

1825
01:28:52.839 --> 01:28:55.060
algorithms these days. It can be pretty obvious when

1826
01:28:55.069 --> 01:28:57.020
I look at her youtube history, it's pretty obvious

1827
01:28:57.029 --> 01:28:59.160
that it's a, a six year old girl's youtube

1828
01:28:59.169 --> 01:29:01.720
history, right? So they could be doing a better

1829
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:04.629
job I think of, you know, not, not recommending

1830
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.060
them videos which are, which are really not appropriate

1831
01:29:07.069 --> 01:29:09.740
for, for that age group. And, and II, I

1832
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.080
think they do, there's a bit of kind of

1833
01:29:12.089 --> 01:29:14.100
holding up their hands, you know, freedom of freedom

1834
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:16.229
of speech. You know, we're not gonna control what,

1835
01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.580
what people view, but they could be a bit

1836
01:29:17.589 --> 01:29:20.560
more proactive about creating a safer experience for kids.

1837
01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.979
I think maybe applies more to younger kids than

1838
01:29:23.009 --> 01:29:26.740
a adolescents. But also, um, you know, if you

1839
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:29.290
think about things like, uh, extreme pornography and so

1840
01:29:29.299 --> 01:29:32.129
on, they could probably be restricting those from adolescence

1841
01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.970
as well, quite more productively.

1842
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:38.319
Yeah. And do you think that knowledge about, uh,

1843
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:43.040
adolescents use of internet technologies could also apply in

1844
01:29:43.049 --> 01:29:46.350
a clinical context. And if so how

1845
01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.479
well I'm not a clinician. So it's hard to,

1846
01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.189
hard to answer that, I think. Um, YEAH, I

1847
01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.609
mean, I, I do think uh it could help

1848
01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.609
in terms of just not, like I said, some

1849
01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.160
psychiatrists maybe take a, a bit of a knee

1850
01:30:02.169 --> 01:30:04.620
jerk response. Oh, you know, it can't be good

1851
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:07.279
that, that, that adolescents are spending all the time

1852
01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:10.770
on the cell phone and not engaging with, you

1853
01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:13.939
know, offline personal relationships with their families. But like

1854
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.359
I say, it's been, it's always been a natural

1855
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:19.129
feature of adolescence. So you tend to withdraw from

1856
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.859
your family, spend a lot of time up in

1857
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.140
your bedroom, you know, and, and I think the

1858
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:25.250
cell phone is just a kind of modern version

1859
01:30:25.259 --> 01:30:27.310
of that really. So I don't think it's intrinsically

1860
01:30:27.319 --> 01:30:32.180
bad. I think um what, what maybe reading the

1861
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:34.310
book could give them would be an understanding of

1862
01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:38.410
what kinds of usage might be particularly damaging to

1863
01:30:38.419 --> 01:30:41.330
adolescents because of the particular vulnerabilities in the sex.

1864
01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:44.200
The chapter on relationships. I talk about them learning

1865
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:46.370
about new sexual relationships and that sort of thing

1866
01:30:46.379 --> 01:30:49.279
and, and how there could be particular risks uh

1867
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:52.220
for certain groups and that the same thing with

1868
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:54.470
um body image eating disorders and so on. So

1869
01:30:54.479 --> 01:30:58.120
there are particular vulnerabilities associated with particular types of

1870
01:30:58.129 --> 01:31:00.209
usage. But again, it's, it would be very much

1871
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:02.250
I would stress the importance of working on a

1872
01:31:02.259 --> 01:31:05.069
case by case basis, looking at the overall social

1873
01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.169
context of the person.

1874
01:31:07.439 --> 01:31:10.500
So one last question, then do you have any

1875
01:31:10.509 --> 01:31:14.629
ideas about how internet use might change in the

1876
01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.509
future? And if so where do you think this

1877
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.020
change might stem from? I mean, would it be

1878
01:31:21.029 --> 01:31:25.819
from, for example, people becoming more aware of how

1879
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:29.569
they use the internet and perhaps the more positive

1880
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.729
and negative ways they can do it and perhaps

1881
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.700
becoming a little bit more literate about it.

1882
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:43.509
Um, MAYBE, I think, I think you can see

1883
01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:50.060
with any new technology when people start, when people

1884
01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:51.479
first use it, there's a kind of lack of

1885
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:55.399
norms and, uh you know, there's a time when

1886
01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:59.470
people, it takes time for people to, to work

1887
01:31:59.479 --> 01:32:01.740
out. I, I think I've seen it's a bit

1888
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:05.830
anecdotal but, you know, people always complain about uh

1889
01:32:05.839 --> 01:32:08.359
the amount of kind of trash talking that takes

1890
01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:11.529
place on Twitter and, and youtube and so on.

1891
01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.509
I have to say my impression is that that

1892
01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.450
that's, and it would be really fascinating to look

1893
01:32:16.459 --> 01:32:18.390
at, you know, the historical records and look at

1894
01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.770
it over time. But I think it's actually gets

1895
01:32:20.779 --> 01:32:22.509
a bit, it's got a bit less frequent over

1896
01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.830
time as people, it always sticks in people's minds,

1897
01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:26.740
right. So they, they just notice it and think

1898
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.979
that it's happening more. But I, I think that

1899
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:32.660
gradually people adapt and, and kind of develop norms

1900
01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:35.020
for kind of etiquette really for, for kind of

1901
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:38.970
influencing these interactions um in, in terms of other

1902
01:32:38.979 --> 01:32:43.209
things that are changing, I think. Uh IT was

1903
01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.910
uh a bit embarrassing to me that Chat G

1904
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:47.709
BT came out just as my book was being

1905
01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:50.879
published because there's nothing in there about A I

1906
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:53.069
at all, basically a little bit of algorithms in

1907
01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.830
the conclusion. But um obviously, if I was writing

1908
01:32:55.839 --> 01:32:57.450
it now, I would spend a lot of time

1909
01:32:57.459 --> 01:33:00.919
talking about chat G BT, especially in educational contexts,

1910
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:04.060
how that's gonna gonna change things. Um So that

1911
01:33:04.069 --> 01:33:06.330
would be a big area where I think um

1912
01:33:06.339 --> 01:33:08.810
it's gonna have really far reaching changes in how

1913
01:33:08.819 --> 01:33:12.770
people uh interact online and offline even as well

1914
01:33:12.779 --> 01:33:19.040
probably. Um And in terms of video communication, I

1915
01:33:19.049 --> 01:33:23.140
think that's something that's less heralded, heralded, heralded than

1916
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:25.959
A I, but it's becoming so much more the

1917
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:29.399
norm just to have video based interactions, especially with

1918
01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:34.939
young people. And um I think, uh for example,

1919
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:37.350
in Vietnam, they, they don't use whatsapp so much.

1920
01:33:37.359 --> 01:33:40.149
There's another tool they have here called Zalu, which

1921
01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.990
is actually more based, I think it's quite common

1922
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.009
in other countries in Southeast Asia, um which is

1923
01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.379
more based on video communication. So it's, I think

1924
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:50.540
eventually you could see how it might almost replace

1925
01:33:50.549 --> 01:33:53.250
chatting quite a lot. And I think that could

1926
01:33:53.259 --> 01:33:57.430
have quite far reaching effects on uh on how,

1927
01:33:57.899 --> 01:34:00.830
how uh how, how we're actually engaging in, in

1928
01:34:01.459 --> 01:34:04.950
interactions. Uh They can feel more, real, less kind

1929
01:34:04.959 --> 01:34:07.290
of a technological interaction and more like a normal

1930
01:34:07.299 --> 01:34:10.319
natural kind of interaction. Uh I think from the

1931
01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:14.259
point of view of education as well, um, it's

1932
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.430
a little bit worrying because you do sort of

1933
01:34:16.439 --> 01:34:19.790
wonder if, if reading is eventually going to disappear

1934
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:24.729
because ST students very much, you know, are, are,

1935
01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.759
um, they, they're kind of, uh, they're keen to

1936
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:30.229
just watch videos. Right. Well, it's good for you

1937
01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.089
for people like you, I suppose they keen to

1938
01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:37.299
watch videos instead of, instead of reading articles. Um,

1939
01:34:37.319 --> 01:34:40.890
AND also they will use, uh, you know, something

1940
01:34:40.899 --> 01:34:43.390
like chat G BT, something called Chat Beat PDF

1941
01:34:43.399 --> 01:34:45.930
where you feed it an article. Uh AND it'll

1942
01:34:45.939 --> 01:34:47.939
like just, it'll answer the questions that you have

1943
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:51.609
about the article. So I, I do, it's not

1944
01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.560
inconceivable but literacy rates could actually go down. And

1945
01:34:55.569 --> 01:34:56.950
if you're looking at sort of 100 years in

1946
01:34:56.959 --> 01:34:58.759
the future as, as people just get used to

1947
01:34:58.770 --> 01:35:00.839
kind of doing everything by video and you sort

1948
01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:03.379
of think, well, what effects will that on society?

1949
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:05.779
Like I talked about the, the printing press, it

1950
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:07.919
could be very, very similar kind of level of

1951
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.069
effects on society, I think

1952
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.379
actually something that I've heard about recently is that

1953
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:17.580
some people fear that young people will also lose

1954
01:35:17.589 --> 01:35:22.240
their handwriting skills because they no longer write by

1955
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.810
hand.

1956
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:28.000
Yeah. And I noticed in my, in my, in

1957
01:35:28.009 --> 01:35:31.330
my daughter's school they told her like proper handwriting.

1958
01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:33.589
And it seemed to me actually that made it

1959
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.620
more difficult for her to learn the letters and

1960
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.359
things than if they just because right from the

1961
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:39.350
beginning, sort of age five or six, they're teaching

1962
01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.439
them proper 100 it just, just traditional, it's a

1963
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:44.490
traditional Catholic school. That's what the way they do

1964
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.490
things. But you'd think it would be kind of

1965
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:50.180
easier just to learn on a keyboard just because

1966
01:35:50.189 --> 01:35:52.740
she's so used to kind of like seeing, seeing

1967
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:55.819
words on the, on the smartphone. But yeah, it's

1968
01:35:56.339 --> 01:35:58.810
so and then you've got the reverse flynn effect,

1969
01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:01.160
right? That you must have heard of that where

1970
01:36:01.529 --> 01:36:04.370
um so it seems like the the IQ games

1971
01:36:04.379 --> 01:36:06.140
in most of the 20th century are actually going

1972
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:09.240
into reverse and kind of controversial to blame that

1973
01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:13.080
on smartphones. But you do, you do wonder what

1974
01:36:13.089 --> 01:36:15.430
else exactly would have, would have caused it if

1975
01:36:15.439 --> 01:36:17.919
it wasn't this, this kind of not needing to

1976
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:20.319
depend on writing so much because you've actually got

1977
01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:23.189
um got more direct ways of communicating with

1978
01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.350
people. So I guess that uh let's see how

1979
01:36:27.359 --> 01:36:30.430
things go. And now with a I particularly it's

1980
01:36:30.439 --> 01:36:35.270
sort of a brave new world, right? OK. So

1981
01:36:35.279 --> 01:36:38.220
the book is again, adolescent use of new media

1982
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:41.790
and internet technologies, debating risks and opportunities in the

1983
01:36:41.799 --> 01:36:44.250
digital age. And I'm leaving a link to it

1984
01:36:44.259 --> 01:36:46.919
in the description of the interview. And Dr Ingram,

1985
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:49.149
apart from the book, would you like to tell

1986
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.470
people where they can find you when your work

1987
01:36:51.479 --> 01:36:52.430
on the internet?

1988
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.830
Um, OH, I was, I didn't really expect it.

1989
01:36:58.839 --> 01:37:00.600
I mean, if you go to my Google Scholar

1990
01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.319
page, I don't know if you can link to

1991
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.720
that or if

1992
01:37:02.729 --> 01:37:04.600
you, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can, I

1993
01:37:04.609 --> 01:37:06.890
can if you search for Gordon in room, uh,

1994
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:09.979
Los Andes, uh it should, it should come up.

1995
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:12.620
So, but yeah, I've got all my articles on

1996
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:14.819
uh on Google on the Google Scholar page.

1997
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:18.509
Ok, great. So thank you so much again for

1998
01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.140
taking the time to come on the show. As

1999
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:22.129
I said at the beginning, I really loved the

2000
01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:24.609
book. So it was really fun to talk to

2001
01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.709
you about it. Thank you. Thanks

2002
01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.569
a lot. Very nice to be to have you

2003
01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.629
on the record and uh I look forward to

2004
01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.209
catching up with some of your other interviews. Thank

2005
01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:32.390
