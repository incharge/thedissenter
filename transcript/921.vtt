00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.880
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lops. And

3
00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:09.430
today I'm joined by Dr Alva Noe. He's professor

4
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.130
and Chair of Philosophy at the University of California

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.680
Berkeley. He is the author of many books. And

6
00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:19.049
today we're talking about his latest one, the entanglement,

7
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.409
how art and philosophy make us what we are.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.700
So, Doctor Noah, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:26.819
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.379
Thank you very much for inviting me.

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.439
So the first question I would like to ask

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
you is um since you are, I guess we

13
00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:41.970
could say mostly a philosopher of mind, what got

14
00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.380
you interested also in art and what is art

15
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.279
for you and how do you approach it in

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.200
the book specifically?

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yeah. Thank you very much. That's, that's in a

18
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.709
way the uh it's both a personal question about

19
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.220
me, but in some ways, it really gets us

20
00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.380
right to the very heart of the book. Um

21
00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:04.559
There's different ways I can answer it. Um One

22
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.169
is that sort of biographically, my first book was

23
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.400
called action and Perception. And the central theme of

24
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.580
action and perception was the idea that that um

25
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.430
the best sort of, by a lot, the best

26
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.989
biological way to think about perceptual consciousness is as

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.330
something that the animal accomplishes or achieves and that

28
00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:29.959
it does so against the background of its situation

29
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510
and the environment for humans, that also means the

30
00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:35.870
cultural environment. Um So this sort of idea which

31
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.190
is sometimes called an uh the the inactive approach

32
00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:45.279
to perception, places great emphasis on um the animal's

33
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.150
embodiment and the animal's skills or the person's embodiment

34
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.900
and the person's skills um perception isn't something that

35
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.160
happens inside of us. It's something we do. And

36
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.500
to my um great surprise, I received a lot

37
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.970
of um responses to the book from people working

38
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.270
in the arts, especially people working in the performing

39
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.720
arts, dancers, uh choreographers, but not only dancers and

40
00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.729
choreographers, also painters and sculptors and, and other kinds

41
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.500
of artists. Um And they all were in sort

42
00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.970
of interested as, as a community they were interested

43
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:31.639
in, in seeing what my approach to perception offer

44
00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.500
them, how it supported their understanding of their own

45
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:40.550
work. But I immediately became interested in these conversations

46
00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.289
with the question. Well, what, what do they have

47
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.389
to teach me about the phenomenon that interests me,

48
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.229
what are they doing anyway? What is, what is

49
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.000
this work of, of, of artists? What is, is

50
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.639
it, are they just making decorations? Are they making

51
00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.710
pretty things? Are they? I mean, what, what are,

52
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.419
what are they doing especially since they take themselves

53
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:04.619
very seriously. And uh uh and we take the

54
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.619
arts very seriously. So this got me interested in

55
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.360
the question, what is, what is art and what

56
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.190
is the source of its value? And my, my

57
00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.210
first attempt to explore that was in my book,

58
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.309
Strange Tools, which was published at the very end

59
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.279
of 2015 Strange Tools, subtitle Art and Human Nature.

60
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.130
Um And in that book, I really asked the

61
00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.050
question, what is our, what, why does it matter

62
00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.149
to us and what does the fact that it

63
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.479
matters to us? Tell us about ourselves? Mhm. Um

64
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.800
The, the current book, um the Entanglement goes way

65
00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:44.839
beyond uh Strange Tools and it's been kind of

66
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.470
a, a transformative experience for me writing it. Um

67
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.770
But um to come back to your, your question,

68
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.619
you can think about the question, what is art

69
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.809
kind of anthropologically? Mhm. Um Or if you like

70
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.320
philosophically and, and the contrast I have in mind

71
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.389
there is in one sense, we all know what

72
00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:13.970
art is, we can just refer to it. There's,

73
00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.559
there's painting and there's music and there's film and

74
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.540
there's dance and there's pottery and there's um you

75
00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:24.420
know, installation art and I'm, I'm forgetting one, I'm

76
00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:28.760
sure. But, but art is this specific set of

77
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.089
making activities that preoccupy human beings pretty much everywhere

78
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.709
and pretty much always. Um So there's a, there's

79
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.010
probably if you think of art in terms of

80
00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:43.119
those collections of, of things that we do playing

81
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.220
the drums, playing the flute, writing novels, with all

82
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.779
of all of that is art. There's probably not

83
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.950
any straightforward way of, of uh defining what art

84
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.109
is. It's just simply, it's all of that. And

85
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.320
so that's what I mean by an anthropological approach.

86
00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:58.790
You just kind of we all kind of know

87
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.660
roughly what we're talking about when we're talking about

88
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.799
the arts. Um Can you go deeper, can you

89
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:10.160
say something more, more um profound about what art

90
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.869
is, why it, why it matters to us? And

91
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.829
I think you can um I'll tell you my

92
00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.000
bottom line, but in a way how you get

93
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.119
to the bottom line is the more interesting question.

94
00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:28.970
I think that art is uh art, arts, the

95
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.690
arts are practices and their practices through which we

96
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.549
reorganize ourselves. And even I would go so far

97
00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:49.109
as to say, liberate ourselves from the habits and

98
00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:58.269
other systems of organization, cultural, biological, emotional linguistic that

99
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.160
in some sense, hold us captive. And I mean,

100
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.059
I could say one more thing about that. Um

101
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.769
You know, the thing is one of the beautiful

102
00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.760
things about art and what makes art puzzling is

103
00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:18.420
that on the face of it materially speaking, it

104
00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:22.760
really looks no different from other forms of technological

105
00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:28.040
manufacture and making, you know, um people make things

106
00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:30.760
I make, you know, somebody manufactured this glass of

107
00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:34.609
water. Um THE, the pen, the computer, the telephone

108
00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.149
the systems that we're using right now, the clothes

109
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.410
that we're wearing all of this is made and

110
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.160
art is just more stuff that we make. So,

111
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.500
one of the interesting questions is how does the

112
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.880
making, the dedicated dedication to making in the sphere

113
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.269
of art differ from the dedication to making in

114
00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:01.950
the sphere of manufacture or industry or technology? And

115
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:06.339
um answering that question is the key. Mhm

116
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.940
So you mentioned many different things there and we'll

117
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.179
certainly get through them in our conversation. But uh

118
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.690
the question I have now is then art is

119
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.890
much more than, at least in your perception, much

120
00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.839
more than uh than just a cultural curiosity. As

121
00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:30.359
many people would probably think of it.

122
00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:33.640
Right. Right. I guess there, there would be a

123
00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:37.489
view according to which, you know, there's the important,

124
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.369
the really important things in life, food and security

125
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.910
and shelter. And um and only once a society

126
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.290
gets to a certain stage of security and wealth,

127
00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:51.019
do you have time for art? Art is this

128
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:54.380
kind of, it's an extra, it comes, it comes

129
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.369
after and you can do without it. No, the

130
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.359
view that I try to develop in this book,

131
00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:06.899
the arguments I make is that there is nothing

132
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.459
which is recognizably a human form of life that

133
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:19.739
doesn't have art. And that's because art is um

134
00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:24.829
in some ways, I want to say it's both

135
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.839
and a response to the human condition and a

136
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.690
precondition of the human condition. Um We, we make

137
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:41.719
art to, to cope with the challenges of our

138
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:48.460
own existence. But art then changes the character of

139
00:08:48.469 --> 00:08:53.390
our own existence. Um And this, by the way,

140
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.719
a phrase that I use throughout the book is

141
00:08:56.729 --> 00:08:58.960
II, I speak of the entanglement of life and

142
00:08:58.969 --> 00:09:01.330
art and in a way this is the kind

143
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.780
of the core thought there art starts from life.

144
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.450
Mhm By that, I, I don't mean that art

145
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.450
is about life in a kind of semantic sense.

146
00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:19.030
Some artist, I make a picture of you and

147
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:21.070
then it's about you and it's about something I

148
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.020
experienced in my living world. Um But I mean,

149
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:29.349
something more like we make art out of life

150
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:34.450
or life gives art its raw materials. But the

151
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.750
very act of bringing those raw materials into focus

152
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.619
in the way that art lets us do gives

153
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.909
us resources. This is I'm speaking very abstractly now

154
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:47.369
I can give examples later but gives us ex

155
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:54.780
example, gives us resources for living differently so that

156
00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:58.000
we make art out of life. But then life

157
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.909
becomes something new in an art world and then

158
00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:04.659
art becomes something new given that the change in

159
00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:09.619
life and you get a kind of historical circular

160
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.270
pattern of making and remaking and making and remaking.

161
00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:18.840
Um WHERE we face a kind of almost paradoxical

162
00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:26.000
conclusion, which is that um we are somehow by

163
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.510
nature bound up with art. But by that very

164
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.619
fact alone, it's no longer quite appropriate to speak

165
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.479
of our nature at all because our nature is

166
00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:40.780
changing. Um And there's even a sense in which

167
00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:44.020
a AAA rigorous meaningful sense in which we are

168
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.570
ourselves artworks.

169
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.820
So could you give us perhaps some examples of

170
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:57.849
how that entanglement between life and art plays out?

171
00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:04.109
Yeah. Um I'll give you two. I discuss a

172
00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:06.640
number of different examples in the book, but I'll

173
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.440
give you, I'll give you two right now. Um

174
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.590
One is a kind of fairly straightforward one. Um

175
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:25.169
TICK tick dancing, it's tempting to think of dancing

176
00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:28.440
as a sort of a natural human capacity. Um

177
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.510
OR at least it seems to be universal in

178
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.130
human societies and, and if you think about dancing,

179
00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:45.489
it um it serves all sorts of psychological slash

180
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.570
anthropological functions. People dance at weddings or funerals or

181
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.280
they dance in clubs and when they dance at

182
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.590
clubs, it's partly social and it's about communication and

183
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:58.229
maybe about courtship or about, you know, romance or

184
00:11:58.239 --> 00:12:01.010
it can dance. Dance can be many, many different

185
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.140
things, but it's always something it's dancing is always

186
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.710
bound up with needs. Dancing is also very interesting

187
00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:11.880
because it's um it, when people dance, whether in

188
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.140
a club or at a party, they feel um

189
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.599
they get caught up in the dancing, the dancing

190
00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:23.340
has a kind of bodily entrainment to it. You,

191
00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:26.179
you, you, you don't, you don't dance in a

192
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.049
deliberate controlled way if you dance. Well, at all,

193
00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:31.049
you let the dance just happen and you just

194
00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:34.380
move, you let the the demands of the situation,

195
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.729
the partner of the music they govern you. So

196
00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:40.929
dance is a very interesting, a cognitively, extremely interesting

197
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.369
thing that people do. Um But now what about

198
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.809
the art of dancing? What about choreography, the kind

199
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.580
of thing that happens on the stage, right? Well,

200
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:58.179
choreography is, I would say it's dancing severed from

201
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.489
the way in which it's ordinarily embedded in our

202
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.000
lives. Um The dancers on the stage are not

203
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.760
wooing, they're not courting, they're not um they're not.

204
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.450
Well, what they're doing is an interesting question. But

205
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.690
one of the, one of the things that I

206
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.750
would say about what they're doing is that they're

207
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.020
putting, they're displaying dancing itself. There's this thing we

208
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.039
do, it's called dancing. And then the, the art,

209
00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:25.159
the art dancers are putting that thing. We do

210
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.830
itself on the stage and saying this is dancing

211
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:32.830
and so in effect, they're putting us on the

212
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.859
stage as people who are habitually culturally organized by

213
00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:43.679
dancing. Um So I, I see a difference between

214
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.219
dance. Sometimes I say dance with a capital D

215
00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:52.900
and dancing. Mhm Dancing is embedded in our culture

216
00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:56.359
and our psychology and our economy of living dance

217
00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:59.969
is this kind of representation of this thing that

218
00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:07.299
we do when we're dancing. But the image that

219
00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:10.309
dancing gives us, excuse me, the image that choreography

220
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.510
gives us that dance with the capital D gives

221
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.619
us of what we do when we're dancing then

222
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.090
becomes a template or a model or even a

223
00:14:20.099 --> 00:14:25.030
kind of score for how to dance. So that

224
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:28.099
how we spontaneously dance you or I when we're

225
00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:32.460
at a party or celebration or in a nightclub

226
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.979
ends up being influenced by the art of dance.

227
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.190
But then the art of dance is concerned with

228
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.359
the way in which dancing organizes us and our

229
00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:46.950
lives. So the art of dance will then be

230
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.349
influenced by the changes in the way we dance.

231
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.479
And so you get a kind of a loop

232
00:14:53.039 --> 00:15:00.150
of the representation of dancing, altering dancing and dancing,

233
00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:03.539
giving rise to new pictures or models or templates

234
00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:09.479
or scores of what dancing can be. No, you

235
00:15:09.489 --> 00:15:12.380
might think. Yes. Well, there's the kind of natural

236
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.109
phenomenon of dancing at the core and then there's

237
00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:17.099
this kind of cultural play that has happened on

238
00:15:17.109 --> 00:15:19.270
top of it. But those are now in tango,

239
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.969
they cannot really any longer be disentangled except in

240
00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:26.359
thought. Now what it is to be a human

241
00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:29.830
being who dances is to be a human being

242
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.190
whose sense of what it is they're doing has

243
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.349
been made available to them through art over long

244
00:15:37.359 --> 00:15:42.919
periods of time. So dance and dancing, art and

245
00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:48.210
life have become inextricably entangled. And this is something

246
00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:50.869
we live each of us individually. In the first

247
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.929
person, you know, you watch, I talk in the

248
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.440
book. But I imagine a little girl dancing by

249
00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.080
herself in a room to music. What she's doing

250
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:06.099
is is informed by a whole set of ideas

251
00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:09.419
and images about what she's doing. This is called

252
00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:12.010
dancing. Dancing looks like this. This is not dancing.

253
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.150
That that's something else. This is how one dances,

254
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:18.130
this is how dancing looks to other people. So

255
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.179
that there's an interesting way that the girl might

256
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.030
just think, oh, put on the music and dance.

257
00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:24.510
No thought at all. But in an interesting way,

258
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:32.109
I think she embodies or incorporates a whole art

259
00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:36.880
history which, which is not ever finished. So that's

260
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:50.169
one example. Um Now that's another another example um

261
00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:57.700
is um it, it's, it's actually slightly more complicated.

262
00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.479
Um But I'll see if I can get a

263
00:16:59.489 --> 00:17:01.140
simple version of it and we can get into

264
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.699
complications if we need to. But um if I

265
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:07.400
show you a photograph of my son, this is

266
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.030
my kid. It's on my Facebook page. It's in

267
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.229
my fa family photo album here. This is my

268
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:19.178
son. My, my photograph is functioning, I believe as

269
00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:22.448
a tool or instrument for display. It's serving a

270
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.839
playing a role in the communication. I'm letting you

271
00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:31.050
see something, I'm showing you something I'm framing um

272
00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:37.439
a kind of extension. This is the Edinburgh Castle,

273
00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:41.189
you know, or this is what the uh lounge

274
00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:45.069
looks like at the Lisbon airport. We use pictures

275
00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:47.739
to show and we use pictures to show for

276
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.640
all sorts of reasons. I can go online and

277
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.380
buy a coat, looking at the pictures of the

278
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.459
coat and I can zoom in and zoom out

279
00:17:56.469 --> 00:17:58.170
or choose this color or that color. Look at

280
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.229
this model. Is that model or every week I

281
00:18:01.239 --> 00:18:03.939
get in the mail from my supermarket. The, the,

282
00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:07.079
the latest deals on chicken and broccoli and there's

283
00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:09.310
pictures, there's pictures of chicken, there's pictures of broccoli

284
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.060
pictures function in a kind of social economy of

285
00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:16.130
communication. Now, I think actually there's a very interesting

286
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.579
set of questions there about how depiction works, how

287
00:18:18.589 --> 00:18:22.709
pictures work and I have ideas about that. But,

288
00:18:22.829 --> 00:18:26.930
but what I'm interested now is the fact that

289
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.250
when I make, when I make an art picture,

290
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.170
I'm no longer just playing the game of showing

291
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.160
you something because the interesting thing about an art

292
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.810
picture and this is analogous to the dancing situation.

293
00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:49.760
The interesting thing about an art picture is there

294
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.839
is no one right way to see it. There

295
00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:54.329
is no one thing it is showing. It doesn't

296
00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:56.959
have a caption that exhausts what it is of

297
00:18:57.609 --> 00:19:06.300
it. It, it resists um being reduced to a

298
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.000
function. It has no, there is no user manual

299
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.770
that tells you what it is or how to

300
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.500
use it or how to make sense of it.

301
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:19.430
The what the picture does the eye picture is,

302
00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:23.099
it takes itself as a picture and extracts it

303
00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:28.050
from the cultural communicative background against which pictures normally

304
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.839
have a depict function. And thus it throws you

305
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.920
the person looking at this work of art back

306
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:43.760
on yourself to interrogate yourself about the role that

307
00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:50.020
ordinary non art pictures have in your life. Um

308
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.099
How pictures shape what we think it is to

309
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.180
look at something or how pictures shape what it

310
00:19:57.189 --> 00:20:01.219
is we think to show something or how pictures

311
00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:04.579
affect our, our feelings about other people or how

312
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:06.890
we use pictures in different ways than we use

313
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.069
in person viewing. So all of a sudden this

314
00:20:09.079 --> 00:20:17.219
work of art has the capacity to what seen

315
00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:21.290
and being seen and looking and showing and the

316
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.119
role these play the meaning these have in our

317
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:29.550
lives themselves on display. Just as the choreographer puts

318
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.920
dancing on display, the the picture puts all the

319
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.869
different things that pictures can mean for us or

320
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.150
the things that are depicted can mean for us.

321
00:20:38.589 --> 00:20:41.540
Like how I feel about the one depicted, my

322
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.030
daughter or God, how, how do we process what

323
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.819
we see? And the work of art then gives

324
00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:52.770
us an opportunity. Um The picture gives us an

325
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.000
opportunity if you like to uncover the place of

326
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:03.199
pictures in our lives. Um And that then in

327
00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:08.910
turn, I believe changes. So what we take for

328
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.790
granted about pictures in our lives and lets us

329
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.939
have different and new attitudes, not just to pictures,

330
00:21:15.949 --> 00:21:18.920
but also to seeing or to showing or to

331
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.599
communicating with pictures and thus you get an entanglement

332
00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:24.160
of the art of pictures in our lives with

333
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.250
pictures. And when you, when you remind yourself that

334
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.209
we've been making and using pictures to show since

335
00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:35.599
prehistoric times, the claim I would make is that

336
00:21:35.609 --> 00:21:39.959
our very conceptions, I, I don't say concept are

337
00:21:39.969 --> 00:21:43.900
very conceptions of what seeing is and visual life

338
00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:47.609
is, have been made and remade through picture making

339
00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:50.859
practices and in particular art making practices with pictures

340
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:53.750
over and over and over and over again. It's

341
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.099
another example. So then, and this starts to get

342
00:21:57.109 --> 00:22:00.670
very exciting for a philosopher because now you come

343
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.510
along and you're a cognitive scientist and you want

344
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.060
to study vision and you think that there is

345
00:22:04.069 --> 00:22:08.609
this fixed stable thing called seeing? Mhm But do

346
00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:13.589
we actually know what seeing is independently of that

347
00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:19.729
generative work of re understanding what we're doing when

348
00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:24.430
we see that is shaped in part by pictorial?

349
00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:31.119
And so give, given what you're what you just

350
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.089
said there. Uh HOW does that all tie to

351
00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:41.060
questions surrounding human nature? First of all, I guess

352
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.560
what is human nature? Because many times when we

353
00:22:44.569 --> 00:22:49.069
use that term, people are referring to something like

354
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.670
um some sort of innate psychology that we are

355
00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.819
born with something that is unchangeable, something that is

356
00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:06.099
sometimes probably the result of our evolutionary history. But

357
00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:10.349
in this particular case, by adding art and then

358
00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:15.729
later on, we'll also get into philosophy, what kind

359
00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:20.660
of picture. Do we get about how we should

360
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.839
understand human

361
00:23:22.849 --> 00:23:27.160
nature? This is the hardest question. Um BECAUSE it's

362
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.339
not, it's not that I really want to deny

363
00:23:29.349 --> 00:23:34.469
human nature. It's that I want us to recognize

364
00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:44.290
the always already already problematic nature of human nature.

365
00:23:44.849 --> 00:23:49.829
And in particular, I want to say that human

366
00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:53.189
nature is an aesthetic problem. And let me see

367
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:57.219
if I can explain that. OK. Um I mean,

368
00:23:57.229 --> 00:23:59.300
I mean, actually, first of all, as a preliminary

369
00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.939
for your, for your audience, I should say, and

370
00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:04.280
this is this, I think is not an original

371
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:09.630
idea to me. Um And is not um even

372
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.719
all that controversial anymore. Um I think we all

373
00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:21.640
recognize how human life is scaffolded by culture and

374
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:27.500
technology. Um We, we can do things you and

375
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:33.209
I not because we're so smart, but because we

376
00:24:33.219 --> 00:24:35.829
are members of a community that gives us the

377
00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:38.819
instruments to do it. So we don't catch our

378
00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:41.589
own food, we don't make our own clothing, we

379
00:24:41.599 --> 00:24:46.069
don't um solve our own survival problems. We, we

380
00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:53.810
rest on um a, an existing network of knowledge

381
00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:56.000
and technology that lets us be the way we

382
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.079
live. And this, you know, this goes down to

383
00:24:59.089 --> 00:25:03.290
very profound levels. Um We use writing and language

384
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.349
to think with. So our very cognitive powers are,

385
00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:11.099
are extended uh as the image goes through um

386
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.229
through technology. Um So, in some sense, we already

387
00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:21.920
know that human nature is the stuff of change

388
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.949
and evolution because all of this is evolving and

389
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:30.780
changing. Um In fact, if you, if you think

390
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:36.910
of leading sort of accounts of human evolutionary origins,

391
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.750
what seems clear is that most of the primary

392
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.500
mutations responsible for modern Homo SAPIEN were done a

393
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:57.000
few 100,000 years ago at least. Um So all

394
00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.479
the stuff that we've made since then, language, dress,

395
00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:05.489
culture, communication, all of that can't be explained just

396
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.760
with reference to the mutations, that stuff that has

397
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.760
been done through collectives of, of this particular ape

398
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:18.579
that we are over, over time. So, um so

399
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.329
already we're, we're at a step of removal from

400
00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:28.239
a certain kind of naive biological reductionism on any

401
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.680
I think persuasive conception of the human mind and

402
00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:36.819
the human life. Um What I believe is further

403
00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:48.239
the case is that human beings resist the ways

404
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:55.109
they find themselves organized by habit, organized by technology,

405
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.520
the technology we speak of technology. But what is

406
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:03.640
a technology? A tool is just the physical component

407
00:27:03.719 --> 00:27:10.890
of a suite of ability, skills, practices, techniques, habits.

408
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.209
So if I can write with a pen, if

409
00:27:13.219 --> 00:27:15.569
I can type on a keyboard, I have Inc

410
00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:17.449
Corp, I have been shaped, I've been molded, I

411
00:27:17.459 --> 00:27:21.849
have been controlled by the keyboard so you can

412
00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:25.839
see it. Um Or the pen, the pen is

413
00:27:25.849 --> 00:27:27.819
designed for my hand and my hand learns to

414
00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:29.619
be a different kind of thing with the pen.

415
00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:32.560
I think that art and philosophy will come to

416
00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:39.449
philosophy, you said mhm are ways that we put

417
00:27:39.459 --> 00:27:45.589
ourselves on display for ourselves and, and let us

418
00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:53.040
make changes, let us resist forms of habitual organization.

419
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.260
So, and that's, that's the work of art, that's

420
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.630
the work of philosophy and that's, that's resistance to

421
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.790
technology, that's resistance to culture in a way. It's,

422
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.890
it's paradox because we think of art as culture.

423
00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:10.650
But in a way I'm saying art is anti

424
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.290
culture, art says no to what culture defines us

425
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.060
as culture says, this is how you walk. This

426
00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:20.640
is how you talk. This is how you look,

427
00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:25.569
this is how you feel. And art says no,

428
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.709
art gives us different ways of walking, talking, looking,

429
00:28:29.719 --> 00:28:35.119
thinking, feeling um which then in turn changes that

430
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.569
so does this mean there's no such thing as

431
00:28:42.579 --> 00:28:46.180
the science of human life? No, but it means

432
00:28:46.189 --> 00:28:49.939
that there's a place inside life for the aesthetic.

433
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:54.380
And I think it has historically been extremely difficult

434
00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:59.079
and maybe even it's finally impossible. I'm not sure

435
00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:02.760
but extremely difficult for science for what we call

436
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:12.810
experimental or empirical science to comprehend the aesthetic and

437
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:15.339
it's in a limit place in our lives. Now,

438
00:29:15.349 --> 00:29:18.079
let, let me say why? Why I say that?

439
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:25.540
Um I actually already gave this example, take the

440
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:30.670
question of perceptual consciousness. So scientists say, OK, consciousness,

441
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.170
it happens in the brain, we can explore its

442
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.969
neural correlates, we can use brain imaging and different

443
00:29:36.979 --> 00:29:39.670
theories of the brain and different theories of cognitive

444
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.949
psychology to model what goes on in the brain

445
00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:47.520
when you see, right? But that takes for granted

446
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.479
that we know what seeing is. And I submit

447
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:59.800
that there are no final settled unproblematic ways of

448
00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:05.199
answering the question. What do you see? Now, scientists

449
00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:11.500
for, for experimental purposes may choose to operationalize the

450
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.750
notion of seeing this way or that way and

451
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.660
that's fine. But you and I are the subjects

452
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:22.339
of seeing, always realize that there's more that we're

453
00:30:22.349 --> 00:30:25.420
not saying is that we're leaving something out. So

454
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.170
right now, I I see the screen but I

455
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.369
also see the background. Now, do I see all

456
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.810
the detail in the background or do I see

457
00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:34.180
some of the detail in the background? Do I

458
00:30:34.189 --> 00:30:36.560
only see what I care about? But also my

459
00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:41.390
vis my experience right now, it's guided by interest

460
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.459
concern what we're doing. It's not separate from our

461
00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:50.439
communication. It's also not not separate from emotions that

462
00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:53.680
I have or curiosities that I have or uh

463
00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:55.660
you know, a desire to promote my book or

464
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.949
a desire to explain these ideas or desire to

465
00:30:57.959 --> 00:31:00.209
come across in a good way. I mean, this

466
00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:05.349
is very, very complicated what set of relationships I

467
00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:08.459
have to my circumstances that I would describe by

468
00:31:08.469 --> 00:31:12.310
saying, you know, I see your image on the

469
00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:14.280
screen, but I see your image on the screen

470
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:22.030
as a kind of uh cliche or minimal uh

471
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.599
under under description of what I see. And my

472
00:31:27.609 --> 00:31:31.660
claim is that our relationship to our own experience

473
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.010
is a little bit like our relation to a

474
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.479
work of art. There's no one exhaustive way to

475
00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:41.839
characterize its meaning. And moreover, the very activity of

476
00:31:43.849 --> 00:31:47.780
thinking about our experience, like thinking about the work

477
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.270
of art changes how we experience the work of

478
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.689
art and changes how we experience ourselves. And I

479
00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:57.400
think that's true for all of the fundamental human

480
00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:02.040
categories. Uh It's true for emotion, it's true for

481
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.619
perception, it's true for consciousness, it's true for feeling.

482
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.599
It's true for affect. I even think it's true

483
00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:09.890
for, for rationality. It's true for, for for reason

484
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:19.119
itself, which means that um science rests on this

485
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:26.869
molten unstable, constantly changing, legitimately contestable domain of the

486
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:38.729
human. And uh that's, that's an important limitation. It

487
00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:44.910
means I think that a certain kind of positive

488
00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:49.040
knowledge such as we have in physics or chemistry

489
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.949
is not going to be available to us in

490
00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:53.430
psychology or cognitive science.

491
00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.989
So, uh I mean, I guess that you've already

492
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.949
addressed there at least a little bit the question

493
00:33:04.959 --> 00:33:12.109
of uh in your view, why probably disciplines like

494
00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:17.229
psychology, cognitive science and other sciences of the mind

495
00:33:17.699 --> 00:33:22.660
are not fully equipped to for uh to give

496
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:28.290
us a complete understanding of our human experience, human

497
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.959
psychology and so on. But then uh could we

498
00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:39.949
get that full picture by adding this understanding of

499
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:45.800
art and philosophy that you present in the book.

500
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.239
And if so, and if so what kind of

501
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:54.550
understanding would this be, if not a strictly scientific

502
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:54.920
one?

503
00:33:56.239 --> 00:34:02.739
Right. It's interesting. We, you know, we, we assume

504
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.790
it's a very funny and bizarre idea that one

505
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.829
would, uh, that one would think that all knowledge

506
00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:15.839
and all experience could be packed into the shape

507
00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:19.309
of science. Science is itself a particular mode of

508
00:34:19.319 --> 00:34:23.378
human life and inquiry. And when you're, you know,

509
00:34:23.388 --> 00:34:28.580
when you're um ta talking to your kid at

510
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.889
dinner, your relation to your child is not the

511
00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:37.270
relation, you have to an empirical phenomenon. Uh You're

512
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.020
in a relationship with your child and your concerns

513
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.368
as a parent. I'm just saying that as an

514
00:34:42.378 --> 00:34:44.539
example, I don't know whether you have Children, but

515
00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:47.447
um your concerns as a parent are as much

516
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:49.358
as you care about what's best for your child

517
00:34:49.368 --> 00:34:51.128
and what science will tell you what's best for

518
00:34:51.138 --> 00:34:53.608
your child. Your concerns as a parent are not

519
00:34:54.370 --> 00:35:00.520
epistemological in that sense. Um And so much of

520
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:07.820
human life has nothing to do with um with

521
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.739
uh with what we do when we're in the

522
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.340
laboratory. Um And one of the curious things that

523
00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.629
philosophy has done is it's opened up this thought

524
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:28.899
that somehow the truest mode of human relationship with

525
00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:31.899
the world around us is something like that of

526
00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:35.679
the scientists relation to the scientific object. Maybe, maybe

527
00:35:35.689 --> 00:35:38.419
this goes back to, to Descartes. I it may

528
00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:42.370
go back farther. But um you know, in the

529
00:35:42.379 --> 00:35:45.959
book, I talk about the contrast between between Descartes

530
00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:55.969
and Vica um uh for Des Cartes, the scientific

531
00:35:55.979 --> 00:36:02.590
method, the geometrical method is, is the basis is

532
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.850
the fundamental mode of knowing Vico, who I'm, I'm

533
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.629
not an expert on and I rely heavily on

534
00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:14.209
secondary sources in my understanding of Vico. But Vico

535
00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:18.149
is um especially I might say a lovely book

536
00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:25.949
about him by Jurgen Trabant. Um uh Vico is

537
00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:32.810
a uh is a person who thinks of poetry

538
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.370
and wit and style and irony as the basic

539
00:36:37.379 --> 00:36:44.179
modality of human knowing. Um And there's a kind

540
00:36:44.189 --> 00:36:51.139
of comprehension, a kind of deep, intellectually rigorous comprehension

541
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.100
that has to do with language, words, with the

542
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.570
play of the intellect, not the deduction, but the

543
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.020
flirtation. It's a, it's, it's real. I don't know

544
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.699
if he would have said that actually, but it's,

545
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.379
but not the deduction, but the um the ironic

546
00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:16.639
play of, of storytelling. Um And it's, it's interesting

547
00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:24.110
because obviously we need both, we need both, both,

548
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.719
both complement each other. But um so the idea

549
00:37:28.729 --> 00:37:33.739
that there's no place for the kind of special

550
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.840
work we do when we do science is, is

551
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.879
a form of irrational is, but the idea that

552
00:37:40.889 --> 00:37:46.570
all human knowledge should take that form is I

553
00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:53.169
think an equally benighted form of misunderstanding. And it's

554
00:37:53.179 --> 00:37:58.239
one which interestingly, uh it strikes me that it's

555
00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:02.090
one that we're confronting in a very interesting way

556
00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:08.689
in the intellectual space surrounding artificial intelligence, um which

557
00:38:08.699 --> 00:38:11.350
is its whole separate topic. Uh We can put

558
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.409
to one side. But um but so one last

559
00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:16.389
thing then, then I'll shut up because II, I

560
00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:19.060
do give two long answers. I apologize. But the,

561
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.679
I think another name for that space or method

562
00:38:27.689 --> 00:38:37.409
of inquiry, which is necessary and complementary to, to

563
00:38:37.419 --> 00:38:45.290
natural science is philosophy and dark. So, um it's,

564
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.929
I think that there's a way in which um

565
00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:57.780
what philosophy and art aim at doing is not

566
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:04.750
um taking questions for granted and looking for the

567
00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:11.229
solutions, but they explore the questions we've neglected or

568
00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:13.669
they um you know, a quote that I give

569
00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:17.739
in the book comes from, from the American writer

570
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:24.830
James Baldwin is that art uncovers the questions that

571
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.699
have been hidden by the answers. So, and I

572
00:39:28.709 --> 00:39:30.760
think something like that is true of philosophy as

573
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:37.239
well. It's, it's not the answers, it's, it's, it's

574
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:42.780
um what the answers hide from view. Um And

575
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.250
one of the interesting things about a work of

576
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.060
art and this is this is a really important

577
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.310
piece of phenomenological data. One of the really interesting

578
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.300
things about a work of art is it's there

579
00:39:54.310 --> 00:40:00.449
for you on display. It's nothing is hidden as

580
00:40:00.459 --> 00:40:02.979
Liechtenstein might have said it's just, it hangs there,

581
00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:09.879
it sits there and yet you cannot really see

582
00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:16.030
it, it defies straightforward, seeing it, it makes you

583
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.850
do something in order to see it. So for

584
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.449
me and this is, I haven't had a chance

585
00:40:21.459 --> 00:40:24.649
to say this yet in our conversation, but it's,

586
00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.810
it's, it's crucial. I think um I think you

587
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.050
appreciate this based on your reading of the book.

588
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.290
But I offer a new definition of the aesthetic

589
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.989
in this book or not a new definition. I,

590
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.229
I offer a way of thinking about the aesthetic,

591
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:45.879
which I think is somewhat novel. And for me,

592
00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:53.979
the aesthetic denotes the work we do of trying

593
00:40:53.989 --> 00:40:57.689
to see what we cannot see or of trying

594
00:40:57.699 --> 00:41:00.750
to bring into focus, what is open to view,

595
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:07.389
but somehow cut off from it. Aesthetics names the

596
00:41:07.399 --> 00:41:10.350
movement from not perceiving, to perceiving or not seeing,

597
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.340
to seeing or perceiving or seeing to seeing or

598
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:22.770
perceiving differently. And uh that's the work that, that

599
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.959
Plato did and that's the work that Kunz did

600
00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:26.500
and that's the work that Hagel did. And that's

601
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.439
the work that Wittgenstein did and that's the work

602
00:41:28.449 --> 00:41:30.199
that Frager did and that's the work that, that

603
00:41:30.209 --> 00:41:34.030
all great philosophers really aim at not new data,

604
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.340
not new facts and but new ways of seeing

605
00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.600
what was there all along or which is just

606
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:49.260
to say works about or philosophical work invites you

607
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.800
to make changes to yourself so that you can

608
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.560
come into a relationship with what is there all

609
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.080
about. And my view is that you can't, you

610
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.340
can't eliminate that. I mean, you li you can

611
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.689
close down every art department and every philosophy department

612
00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:06.250
and only fund engineering and physics departments, but you

613
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.729
can't get rid of art and philosophy because art

614
00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:15.709
and philosophy are prior to physics, um physics is

615
00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:19.520
seeking the explanation, art and philosophy are about perception.

616
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.800
They're about a more immediate kind of, of knowledge.

617
00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:25.850
Um Yeah.

618
00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:32.090
So let me ask you one question about philosophy

619
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.639
just to clarify this point because it's actually something

620
00:42:36.649 --> 00:42:41.000
that uh I mean, I'm not sure uh what

621
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:45.429
is your precise idea here. But when you use

622
00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:49.530
the word philosophy, when you talk about philosophy here

623
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.929
in our conversation, and also in your book, are

624
00:42:52.939 --> 00:43:00.189
you referring to what uh philosophers, academic philosophers or

625
00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:05.389
any other sort of professional philosophers uh do? Or

626
00:43:05.399 --> 00:43:10.979
is it a broader activity that people who are

627
00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:16.439
not professionally, philosophers can also do and can also

628
00:43:16.449 --> 00:43:20.610
experience through, I don't know, thought processes, processes of

629
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:27.360
reflection about their own condition about what kinds of

630
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:34.270
questions might raise uh about the existence or anything

631
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.929
else uh around

632
00:43:35.939 --> 00:43:40.969
them. Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful question. Exactly goes right to

633
00:43:40.979 --> 00:43:46.020
the very heart of the issue. Um It reminds

634
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.179
me of where our conversation began with my distinguishing

635
00:43:49.189 --> 00:43:52.699
uh anthropological sense of what art is from a

636
00:43:52.709 --> 00:43:55.199
more philosophical sense. And I think exactly the same

637
00:43:55.209 --> 00:43:57.479
point can be made about philosophy, you can think

638
00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.750
of, you can think of philosophy as whatever it

639
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.870
is that is taught in philosophy department. So whatever

640
00:44:02.879 --> 00:44:04.540
it is that is published by books that are

641
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.439
categorized as philosophy books. Um And in that sense,

642
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:12.010
and that does kind of give you a nice

643
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.659
way of picking out what it is. And if

644
00:44:13.669 --> 00:44:16.250
you're, if you're a person out there in the

645
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.350
world who's never had the privilege of studying philosophy,

646
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.350
that's a useful way of thinking about what philosophy

647
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.750
is. This is your opportunity to, you go to

648
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.320
a university and you meet people who are dedicated

649
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.060
to this work. Um And that's a very valuable

650
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:34.219
thing, but I would say two things first that

651
00:44:35.179 --> 00:44:39.110
um there's an additional further sense in which philosophy

652
00:44:39.639 --> 00:44:47.550
is a certain style of intellectual work. And that

653
00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:53.550
although academic philosophers do that work, uh that work

654
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.989
is not confined to the work of professional philosophers.

655
00:44:58.639 --> 00:45:07.590
And I would say that philosophy um uh philosophical

656
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:20.639
problems presents itself potentially at least in every walk

657
00:45:20.649 --> 00:45:27.679
of life and in every domain. So to make

658
00:45:27.699 --> 00:45:34.229
AAA I think a fairly uncontroversial point, um there

659
00:45:34.239 --> 00:45:37.070
is philosophy done by people who are empirical sciences.

660
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.300
No many people believe. And I would agree that

661
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:47.699
some of Einstein's most important breakthroughs were philosophical in

662
00:45:47.709 --> 00:45:52.129
the sense that he wasn't discovering a piece of

663
00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:57.129
information about simultaneity. He was really asking us to

664
00:45:57.139 --> 00:45:58.989
get to the heart of what we think we

665
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.360
mean when we speak of two events as being

666
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:05.449
simultaneous. He was doing a kind of conceptual analysis

667
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.510
which for me and I have a kind of

668
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.629
platonic view of this is a kind of reminding

669
00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:14.189
ourselves of how our concepts work and of, of

670
00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:16.350
what our, how our concepts relate to each other.

671
00:46:16.969 --> 00:46:21.149
So similarly, I think a lot of the work

672
00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:26.090
that counts as cognitive science, whether you think of,

673
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.770
of uh work by linguists like Noam Chomsky or

674
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.209
work by vision scientists like David Maher or James

675
00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:41.229
Gibson uh has aspects that I just straight philosophy.

676
00:46:41.989 --> 00:46:44.189
You see this in mathematics. I think a lot

677
00:46:44.199 --> 00:46:49.939
of a lot of mathematics or like take Fraga's

678
00:46:49.949 --> 00:46:53.239
anxieties about what numbers were, those were philosophical anxieties

679
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.100
about the the ontology of number. So I say

680
00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:00.889
all this just because philosophical problems aren't the private

681
00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:03.929
property of card carrying academic professors of philosophy. You

682
00:47:03.939 --> 00:47:07.010
can be a mathematician or a neuroscientist or a

683
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.889
linguist or a computer scientist and engage with philosophy.

684
00:47:11.899 --> 00:47:16.790
So, moreover, I think we engage in philosophy all

685
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.510
the time when we uh outside of intellectual life

686
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:32.340
altogether, when we uh when we interrogate our lives

687
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:39.810
and our values and our choices um ethics is

688
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.840
not confined to the academy. Ethical problems are, are

689
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.919
real problems and they're philosophical problems. So what's the

690
00:47:47.929 --> 00:47:50.810
definition of a philosophical problem then for me, I

691
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.580
mean, I, I don't have a, a perfect answer,

692
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:58.300
but it's gonna be something like this. Philosophical questions

693
00:48:00.209 --> 00:48:06.399
are questions that are substantial and significant, but for

694
00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:12.020
which there are no decision procedures or there are

695
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.489
no settled ways of answering them. So, you know,

696
00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:20.199
I think a classical example is an ethical kind

697
00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:24.219
of where people have different ethical views. There's a

698
00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:28.550
real disagreement and it matters, but there isn't a

699
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.610
method for deciding it's, and that's what I would

700
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.659
say is so there's, there is, I mean, there

701
00:48:36.669 --> 00:48:41.399
is a method for, for, for engaging intellectual exchange

702
00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:47.100
and argument, but there's no method for deciding um

703
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.120
in the way that there is inside well-developed empirical

704
00:48:51.129 --> 00:48:56.310
theory. Um Now what I, the way I just

705
00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:04.429
define philosophical problem is precisely the way um can't

706
00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:09.479
defined an aesthetic problem. The thing about aesthetics is

707
00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:21.620
um different people can have different aesthetic responses and

708
00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:25.409
there's no way of deciding in advance as it

709
00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:30.899
were, who's right and who's wrong. And yet, according

710
00:49:30.909 --> 00:49:34.879
to Kant, the disagreement is inters subjectively significant, actual

711
00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:38.360
disagreement. It's not like I like vanilla, you like

712
00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:43.080
chocolate. It's like no chocolate is better than vanilla.

713
00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:46.280
And it's, we can, we, we can argue about

714
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:52.199
that. Um um uh And people do argue about

715
00:49:52.209 --> 00:49:55.560
it and they do change their minds over time,

716
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:59.229
not because there's a Qed. So I think it

717
00:49:59.239 --> 00:50:02.949
was actually Gilbert Ryle who said no philosophical argument

718
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:12.459
ends with a Qed. Thus, it prove um I

719
00:50:12.469 --> 00:50:15.879
agree with that. Now, let me just let me

720
00:50:15.889 --> 00:50:19.800
say something else. A very interesting question. What the

721
00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:24.629
way I've just characterized philosophy is how that stands

722
00:50:24.639 --> 00:50:27.780
in relation to the actual practice of professional philosophers

723
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:34.129
um at universities. Um Is this a revisionist analysis

724
00:50:34.139 --> 00:50:37.020
or am I saying that there's what, what, how

725
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:40.250
does, how does, how does that, that go? And

726
00:50:41.719 --> 00:50:47.100
um I guess I would say something like this,

727
00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:52.699
the final value of the work done by philosophers

728
00:50:53.949 --> 00:51:04.899
at universities like my own is the way it

729
00:51:08.229 --> 00:51:11.939
enables the kind of change and transformation that I'm

730
00:51:11.949 --> 00:51:16.330
talking about. Whether or not that's the conscious aim

731
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.540
or objective of the philosophers in question and whether

732
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:27.570
or not they have that particular self understanding. So,

733
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.479
you know, these days, I think especially in the

734
00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:42.699
analytic philosophical world, there's a huge pressure to model

735
00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:46.909
philosophy on the model of the sciences. So to

736
00:51:46.919 --> 00:51:49.219
give, to give an example, it is rarely discussed.

737
00:51:49.229 --> 00:51:53.600
But I think it's very interesting. Yes, in science,

738
00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:57.310
you write abstracts of articles and people can search

739
00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.350
abstracts and that's very useful because if I wanna

740
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.790
start working on a certain protein, I wanna search

741
00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.350
and find out who else has worked on that

742
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.770
protein and be sure I've read everything that's ever

743
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.169
been written about it. And so now we abstract

744
00:52:14.179 --> 00:52:17.620
philosophy papers too. If you try to publish philosophical

745
00:52:17.629 --> 00:52:22.870
article, you need to submit an abstract. But a

746
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:27.340
philosophy paper cannot be summed up as a simple

747
00:52:28.159 --> 00:52:32.939
finding or abstracted claim because there are none in

748
00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:36.820
philosophy that is in philosophy. The the very meaning

749
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.300
of the claim is always what the paper is

750
00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:44.719
about. Philosophy literally doesn't have a bottom line. It's

751
00:52:44.899 --> 00:52:49.050
it's always an interrogation. The meaning of the bottom

752
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.550
line depends on all the conversation and reasoning that

753
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.340
gets you there, which is why we can read

754
00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:01.679
Kant without agreeing with Kant. We don't say, oh,

755
00:53:01.689 --> 00:53:05.060
he was mistaken. Therefore, we don't read him or

756
00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.689
Plato is mistaken. Therefore, we don't read him or,

757
00:53:09.149 --> 00:53:11.419
you know, Bertrand Russell was mistaken. Therefore, we don't

758
00:53:11.429 --> 00:53:16.449
read him. And there's a way in which the

759
00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:19.860
category of mistake is not even relevant. What we're

760
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:24.459
interested in is whether the work they're doing helps

761
00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:31.209
us with the problems we have. And that depends

762
00:53:31.219 --> 00:53:34.000
on the work we do with the text. And

763
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.699
there is nothing to do with the bottom line.

764
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.929
I mean, it doesn't to do with the bottom

765
00:53:36.939 --> 00:53:38.239
line, but it has to do with how we

766
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:43.149
reach the bottom line, you know, are mathematical propositions

767
00:53:43.159 --> 00:53:49.550
synthetic a priori. Well, what the really interesting question

768
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.979
is not whether co was right or wrong? But

769
00:53:50.989 --> 00:53:53.290
what does that mean? What does it mean to

770
00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.629
say that the synthetic opera? Why would one say

771
00:53:55.639 --> 00:53:57.790
that? What is one trying to, what is the

772
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.409
insight one is trying to capture, capture when you

773
00:54:00.419 --> 00:54:04.449
say that? And then you can go further, you

774
00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:07.600
say, well, it means we don't, we don't use

775
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.729
ordinary empirical methods for verifying mathematical statements. Well, that's

776
00:54:11.739 --> 00:54:16.090
true. Um So why aren't they, why aren't they

777
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.139
just here? Well, and yet they seem to be

778
00:54:21.159 --> 00:54:25.169
substantial, not merely logical, they seem to be telling

779
00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:27.870
us about something they seem to have content. Oh

780
00:54:27.879 --> 00:54:30.959
OK. So they're synthetic. And so then you tell

781
00:54:30.969 --> 00:54:32.790
Mr, but then there's, you can get into the

782
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.110
discussions and maybe that is, or it isn't a

783
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.729
useful way of summing it up. Most people these

784
00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:41.989
days I think, don't argue for the view that

785
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.070
mathematics is synthetic or p why not. Um Anyway,

786
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.350
so, so one of the ideas I play with

787
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.899
in the book, which is kind of a uh

788
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.399
a whimsical idea. But I think there's, there's really

789
00:54:57.409 --> 00:54:59.679
some truth to it is I think of a

790
00:54:59.689 --> 00:55:04.800
philosophical text is like a musical score. And when

791
00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.629
I teach my students a philosophical text, I'm teaching

792
00:55:07.639 --> 00:55:12.760
them not to know what the author believed, but

793
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.739
I'm teaching them to play the score, to play

794
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:22.340
along, to play with, to make, to make philosophy,

795
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:30.919
with this, this, this, these resources and you know,

796
00:55:33.139 --> 00:55:36.260
finally the, the the students are gonna tell me

797
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.429
whether it's meaningful to them and they either will

798
00:55:39.439 --> 00:55:43.360
or will not keep playing philosophers grow out of

799
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:47.989
fashion. You know, when I was a student starting

800
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.050
my graduate studies, you couldn't have a philosophical, philosophical

801
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.939
conversation about anything without talking about Donald Davidson. Mm

802
00:55:57.989 --> 00:56:01.510
Or, or, or coin, I don't often hear people

803
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:05.659
refer to Quan and Davidson these days, not because

804
00:56:05.669 --> 00:56:09.899
their work is any less important as it once

805
00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:12.610
was, but people are less interested in playing it.

806
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.050
They wanna play other music now they wanna play

807
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:20.750
other styles of, of thinking. Now, I might, I

808
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.360
might not be correct about that, but that's a,

809
00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:27.040
I'm giving that as an example. Um Kant has

810
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.449
stayed in fashion ever since he, ever since he

811
00:56:30.459 --> 00:56:37.280
appeared Hager Nietzsche. These guys, they're, they're like, always

812
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:43.629
popular. Why? Because they're right. And what we talk

813
00:56:43.639 --> 00:56:47.810
about the difference between analytic and continental philosophy, that's

814
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.979
the most to anybody who's outside of philosophy, that's

815
00:56:50.989 --> 00:56:53.659
the stupidest thing that there could possibly be like

816
00:56:53.939 --> 00:56:57.000
or for that matter, Western philosophy versus world philosophy.

817
00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:03.479
Why, why should, why should we only care about

818
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.060
philosophy in one language or in one tradition? That's

819
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:11.399
silly. Um On the other hand, if you think

820
00:57:11.409 --> 00:57:14.979
of it, is it like music? Well, people live

821
00:57:14.989 --> 00:57:17.909
inside their musical cultures, they live inside their artistic

822
00:57:17.919 --> 00:57:20.820
cultures. I can't, I don't know how to speak

823
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.540
Chinese and I don't know how to play Chinese

824
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:26.959
philosophy. I mean, that's in, that's I don't mean

825
00:57:26.969 --> 00:57:29.860
to be making an argument for uh or like

826
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:34.219
ignorance. But on the other hand, people specialize people

827
00:57:34.229 --> 00:57:36.840
live inside the, the places where they find themselves.

828
00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:42.469
Um And in doing so, they also expand. So

829
00:57:42.479 --> 00:57:53.250
European philosophy is, is not confined to Europe. So

830
00:57:53.439 --> 00:57:56.679
let me ask you one question, I think that

831
00:57:56.689 --> 00:58:00.350
you've already been touching on this throughout our conversation.

832
00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:05.810
But when it comes to science, specifically taking into

833
00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.719
account the sort of a framework that you present

834
00:58:10.729 --> 00:58:14.250
in the book. And since science itself is also,

835
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.330
of course, a human endeavor then um how does

836
00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:25.600
it relate to philosophy, to art? And I, is

837
00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:30.610
there space for uh art, for example, in the

838
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:35.260
very practice of science or not?

839
00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:39.939
Yeah. Um So I'm thinking about it because it's

840
00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:44.250
um I, I really don't wanna say no to

841
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.939
science, I wanna say yes to art and yes

842
00:58:47.949 --> 00:58:53.449
to philosophy. And I think that um I mean,

843
00:58:53.459 --> 00:58:55.469
I think that there, I mean, in the book,

844
00:58:55.479 --> 00:58:58.639
the way I explore this is I want to

845
00:58:58.649 --> 00:59:04.350
differentiate art um from life or arts, from technology.

846
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.439
And I wanted different which means like I differentiate

847
00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:14.419
art from design. Um And I differentiate philosophy from

848
00:59:14.429 --> 00:59:25.979
science, but these are entangled, right? Um There is,

849
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.209
there is no science without philosophy and there is

850
00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:39.979
no philosophy without science. Um Not just because some

851
00:59:39.989 --> 00:59:43.340
philosophers are sometimes interested in empirical questions or some

852
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:48.139
scientists are sometimes interested in philosophical questions, but because

853
00:59:50.679 --> 00:59:59.209
science and philosophy are different neighborhoods or sort of

854
00:59:59.219 --> 01:00:03.850
different ends of a spectrum to change the metaphor.

855
01:00:06.899 --> 01:00:09.590
And they, they have there's also neighborhoods where they're

856
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.810
very near to each other. So some philosophical work

857
01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:20.989
just is not in interestingly or meaningfully different from

858
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.310
empirical scientific work and vice versa. Um So notice

859
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.870
I'm not saying, oh yeah, scientists should study art

860
01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:34.000
because it'll be a useful method for their scientific

861
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:37.270
work that may or may not sometimes be true.

862
01:00:37.879 --> 01:00:44.550
Um I mean, a very interesting domain kind of

863
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.830
problem that comes up in science is uh is

864
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.250
visualization. Um WHETHER a scientist is trying to visualize

865
01:00:54.260 --> 01:01:00.209
a black hole with a picture or visualize or

866
01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:02.949
in some sense, represent the structure of a protein

867
01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:13.989
molecule or whether they want to um represent how

868
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.699
the brain is built. I mean, an interesting example

869
01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:28.169
is uh Gogi and Kahar one, the Nobel Prize

870
01:01:28.639 --> 01:01:31.959
essentially for making good pictures of cells. They just

871
01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:33.909
took pictures of cells, they figured out how to

872
01:01:33.919 --> 01:01:36.959
do it, but they didn't just photograph the cell.

873
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.120
They Dr Ramon Khal drew the sir and his

874
01:01:42.129 --> 01:01:48.840
drawings were theoretically informed explanations of how the cells

875
01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:53.760
worked. So he's a, he really understood the dendritic

876
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:58.239
and the the the the axonic structure and the

877
01:01:58.689 --> 01:02:03.629
um the cell body versus these, these, these fingerings

878
01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:10.100
that that come out. Um So in a way,

879
01:02:10.379 --> 01:02:13.030
all he did was help you see something that

880
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.590
was there, which is very close to my definition

881
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.389
of what an artistic project is. And he certainly,

882
01:02:19.399 --> 01:02:22.399
apparently from what I understand about uh Ramon Kaha,

883
01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:26.280
uh Santiago Monica's life as if he, he wanted

884
01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:28.050
to be an artist. And his father said, no,

885
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.389
his father said you have to stay in the

886
01:02:29.399 --> 01:02:32.310
family business, which is medicine. So he found a

887
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.929
way to be an artist in medicine and these

888
01:02:35.939 --> 01:02:38.719
drawings of his, I'm sure you've seen them. Now

889
01:02:38.729 --> 01:02:41.600
there's now some beautiful books available, the new production,

890
01:02:41.909 --> 01:02:47.899
um these are puzzling drawing. Now, I mean, they're

891
01:02:47.909 --> 01:02:51.729
interesting drawings. Now, for me, I said at the

892
01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:55.070
outset that the difference between an art drawing and

893
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.320
a and a and a mere pictorial drawing is

894
01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:02.419
that a mere pictorial drawing has a function, it's

895
01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:05.310
of something and you read the caption and that

896
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.239
tells you what it's of and this is a

897
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:13.129
representation of that. Um So if you stick strictly

898
01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:18.820
to that definition, then, then uh Ramonica has work

899
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:25.330
is not artwork, it's illustration. OK. But is it

900
01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.479
only that, is it ever, only one thing are

901
01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:32.360
things ever? Only one thing? This is a really

902
01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:36.979
interesting point because um this is a feature of

903
01:03:36.989 --> 01:03:45.600
the entanglement. So take, take the great paintings of

904
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:50.199
renaissance churches in a, in a sense, they have

905
01:03:50.209 --> 01:03:53.620
a caption. These are illustrations of stories from the

906
01:03:53.629 --> 01:04:00.379
Bible for illiterate people. These are precisely didactic, functional

907
01:04:00.389 --> 01:04:07.179
tools for indoctrination. But they're not only that they're

908
01:04:07.189 --> 01:04:10.780
never, they're never only that. I mean, sometimes they

909
01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:12.600
are only that and then they're not very artistically

910
01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:17.409
interesting. But the reason why we why even non-christian

911
01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:21.659
people, non-religious people visit those churches today is because

912
01:04:21.669 --> 01:04:25.379
they're not only that. Mhm And that might be

913
01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:28.860
true of Kahal Ramon Kala as well, which is

914
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:35.149
interesting. Um So I don't want to be dogmatic

915
01:04:35.629 --> 01:04:37.330
and this is why I use this metaphor of

916
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.850
the entanglement because it, it allows you to see

917
01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.989
how two things can become one thing even though

918
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.120
there are two things.

919
01:04:49.379 --> 01:04:53.159
So uh, I have one last topic that I

920
01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:55.879
would like to explore with you here today. I'm

921
01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:58.790
not sure if this will be necessarily my last

922
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.669
question or not. But let's see. So, e even

923
01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:06.820
before we started recording, we were talking a little

924
01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.590
bit and one of the subjects that we touched

925
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.159
on that we, I thought would be very interesting

926
01:05:14.169 --> 01:05:18.040
to bring back here to the interview was that,

927
01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:22.840
um, across the world at the moment, at least,

928
01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:26.300
and you were talking about there in the US?

929
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.760
And I said that here in Portugal is more

930
01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:32.219
or less the same. People are feeling this sense

931
01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:36.469
of uneasiness. We think that or we look at

932
01:05:36.479 --> 01:05:40.939
things as very fragile. Uh I mean, the economic

933
01:05:40.949 --> 01:05:46.649
situation, the political context, new wars breaking out climate

934
01:05:46.659 --> 01:05:51.219
change and so on, everything seems very unstable. And

935
01:05:51.229 --> 01:05:56.520
the reason why I'm bringing this to the conversation

936
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:59.879
is that, uh I mean, is there any way

937
01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:06.510
by which we can understand uh our current state

938
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.929
and the way we react, reacting to things, our

939
01:06:09.939 --> 01:06:13.979
sense of uneasiness and so on through the kind

940
01:06:13.989 --> 01:06:17.830
of framework that you bring to your

941
01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.179
book? Yeah, I'm, I'm glad you bring this up.

942
01:06:23.189 --> 01:06:25.840
It's something I've been thinking a lot about. One

943
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:29.250
of, one of my favorite texts in this vicinity

944
01:06:29.989 --> 01:06:33.330
is Hussars, this the um the crisis of the

945
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.439
European Sciences. Um I don't know if this is

946
01:06:37.449 --> 01:06:40.080
a book that, you know, um it was published

947
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:43.010
in the, it was written in the late 19

948
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:49.790
thirties. After Hal was already in exile, he was

949
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.919
forced into exile, lost his professorship because he was

950
01:06:52.929 --> 01:06:57.379
Jewish. And in under national socialism, he couldn't, he

951
01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:03.959
couldn't teach. Um HE was in Prague, I think

952
01:07:03.969 --> 01:07:08.290
when he wrote, when he wrote this book and

953
01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:13.399
you know, the, the Second World War was on

954
01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:22.590
the horizon, Confronting Germany Europe and the World. And

955
01:07:24.379 --> 01:07:32.310
in that book, whose role makes by my reading

956
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:41.719
at least a wild clam, he says that the

957
01:07:41.729 --> 01:07:44.620
problem that the world is facing is a philosophical

958
01:07:44.629 --> 01:07:49.449
problem. You know, here's Germany getting ready to invade

959
01:07:49.459 --> 01:07:51.840
all of Europe. He himself has been deprived of

960
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:57.030
his position. Anti-semitism is run amok and the problem

961
01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.750
is philosophical and specifically, he thought it was a

962
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.550
problem with European science, a philosophical problem about science.

963
01:08:06.729 --> 01:08:12.439
Mm um And then further what the problem was

964
01:08:12.449 --> 01:08:17.459
for hu was not that science was too insufficient

965
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.169
or too weak, but that it was too strong,

966
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:24.209
it was too powerful, it was too effective. Science

967
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.009
was taken over everything and every space seemed to

968
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.639
be a scientific space. Um But Huso said that

969
01:08:32.648 --> 01:08:39.490
that the kinds of standards of precision positivity that

970
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:49.149
science offers us don't apply to ourselves. Just as

971
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.770
I've been arguing, they don't apply to consciousness subjectivity,

972
01:08:54.930 --> 01:09:02.979
they don't apply to reason itself. Now, how you

973
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.600
get from there to the Second World War is

974
01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.220
that's a kind of a what I'm not sure

975
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:09.120
this, that's the direction I want to go in.

976
01:09:09.859 --> 01:09:13.729
But our cultural moment strikes me as very, very

977
01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:25.910
similar to his we science is immensely prestigious in

978
01:09:25.919 --> 01:09:33.417
our world today. And yet the fundamental picture of

979
01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:37.600
human life that science offers, it is very limited.

980
01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.649
I mean, there are different, there are different offerings.

981
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.640
There's the evolutionary perspective, according to which we're genes,

982
01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.140
there's the sort of the neuroscientific perspective according to

983
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:54.318
which we're just brain cells. There's the kind of

984
01:09:54.329 --> 01:09:59.009
computational perspective according to which we're just algorithms. Um

985
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.109
But I think that there's something dissatisfying and unbelievable

986
01:10:09.319 --> 01:10:13.759
that the embodied socially situated historical beings that we

987
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:17.040
are could be just brain cells or just genes

988
01:10:17.049 --> 01:10:21.270
or just algorithms. And um and that then in

989
01:10:21.279 --> 01:10:33.189
turn, I think maybe breeds anti scientific suspicion because

990
01:10:33.419 --> 01:10:35.319
there's a kind of way in which science is

991
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:39.790
making claims that are not believable. So, and maybe

992
01:10:39.799 --> 01:10:43.310
that feeds crisis, I'm not sure, certainly one of

993
01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:46.680
the different crises we face when you think about

994
01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:50.390
the climate crisis is how many people deny the

995
01:10:50.399 --> 01:10:57.009
climate crisis. Um OR um you know, we saw,

996
01:10:57.259 --> 01:11:01.140
we saw during the pandemic how many people denied

997
01:11:02.169 --> 01:11:08.689
the uh the necessity and efficacy of vaccine, um

998
01:11:12.029 --> 01:11:15.890
religious religious fundamentalists around the world, you know, deny

999
01:11:15.899 --> 01:11:21.209
evolution, they deny anything. And uh and in one

1000
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.490
sense, don't get me wrong. I'm I, I speak

1001
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.689
as a, as a lover of science. Um IN

1002
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:32.339
one sense, I think they are rightly castigated as

1003
01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:37.330
ignorant and idiotic. These people who, who attack science

1004
01:11:37.339 --> 01:11:42.910
in that way, but not entirely because science as

1005
01:11:42.919 --> 01:11:46.790
hr feared, knows no bounds and seems to be

1006
01:11:46.799 --> 01:11:49.310
the only game in town. But the, but these

1007
01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:52.870
important questions that matter to us about values, subjectivity,

1008
01:11:52.879 --> 01:11:59.379
consciousness, rationality, these questions are not scientist questions, but

1009
01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:01.979
how do we answer them? Well, they're philosophies questions.

1010
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:07.660
They're arts questions. So again, I, I would be

1011
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:11.209
embarrassed to argue that art and philosophy can save

1012
01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.950
us. You know, that, that, that, that, that um

1013
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:19.160
that we can, you know that art and philosophy

1014
01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:23.000
are gonna cure the climate crisis. No, obviously not,

1015
01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.629
you need science for that, but science alone can't

1016
01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.520
do it either. Art and philosophy are, are part

1017
01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:38.660
of a solution. And um so in a, in

1018
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:42.240
one way, I'm very, you can think of my

1019
01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.490
book. It has many I'm doing, I'm doing different

1020
01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.020
things in the book. But one of the things

1021
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:51.859
I'm doing is I'm making an argument against uh

1022
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:58.720
the sort of the stem worldview, science, technology, engineering,

1023
01:12:58.729 --> 01:13:04.049
mathematics as if that's, that's, that's the important thing

1024
01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:10.180
and I appreciate that um not everybody can be

1025
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:14.149
a philosopher, not everybody can be an artist, just

1026
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.709
as not everybody can be a science or an

1027
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.390
engineer or a scientist or an engineer. But um

1028
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.620
it does seem to me that um if we

1029
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:25.379
neglect science and our, our situation is very helpless,

1030
01:13:26.589 --> 01:13:29.310
excuse me for neglect philosophy and art, the situation

1031
01:13:29.319 --> 01:13:34.080
is very helpless. So,

1032
01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:38.660
yeah, so perhaps that would be a good note

1033
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.680
to end on. Uh THE book is again the

1034
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:43.080
entanglement, sorry,

1035
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:46.850
a very sad and depressing note, I suppose. But

1036
01:13:46.859 --> 01:13:48.290
in a way, I mean, it to be a

1037
01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:51.830
positive, a positive note and I'm singing the praises

1038
01:13:51.839 --> 01:13:53.000
of art and philosophy.

1039
01:13:54.459 --> 01:14:00.069
Yes. So the book is again the entanglement how

1040
01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.069
art and philosophy make us what we are. I'm

1041
01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.060
leaving a link with in the description box of

1042
01:14:07.069 --> 01:14:11.029
the interview and doctor. No. Uh Just before we

1043
01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.919
go apart from the book, would you like to

1044
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:16.990
tell people where they can find you when your

1045
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.390
work on the internet?

1046
01:14:19.069 --> 01:14:23.439
Oh, yeah, thank you. I had a uh um

1047
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:26.029

1048
01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.240

1051
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.259

1052
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:47.049

01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:05.569

show. I really love the book so I can't

1063
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:24.299
recommend it enough to my audience. And I hope

1064
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:28.040
that everyone out there that will eventually listen to

1065
01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:30.979
