00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.190
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.050
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loops. And

3
00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.529
today I'm joined by Doctor Sudan Krishna Ryan. He

4
00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.460
is associate professor in Political Science at a University

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.190
in Denmark. His research agenda seeks to understand and

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.530
explain political regime instability. And today we're going to

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.670
talk about democratic regimes, autocratic regimes, their instability and

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.990
stability and citizen support for democracy. So Doctor Krish

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.459
Krishna Rayan, welcome to the show. It's a big

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.540
pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.189
Yeah. Thanks for, for having me and thank you

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.509
Ricardo for, for doing this show. I think it's

13
00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:47.159
important that we disseminate our research to, to a

14
00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:49.810
broad audience. Uh AND series like yours are a

15
00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.849
vital part of this. So, so thank you as

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.270
well.

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.549
Well, thank you for the kind words and it's

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.060
my pleasure. So let me start by asking you

19
00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.509
a basic question, I guess. So, from the perspective

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.830
of political science, what is democracy? I mean, how

21
00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:11.389
does a political scientist define democracy?

22
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.069
Yeah, that's uh probably one of the, the toughest

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.180
questions to ask because there are almost as many

24
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.669
definitions of democracy as you have scholars of democracy,

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.510
people disagree heavily about what is democracy, how should

26
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:32.290
we define this very contested concept? Um I think

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.489
in its, in its broadest sense, you would argue

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.919
that democracy is ruled by the people, right? So

29
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.610
you and me, ordinary citizens, we decide who our

30
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.410
leaders are. Um But beyond this very general understanding,

31
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:50.209
people disagree heavily about what is democracy. Uh Right

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.830
now, there seems to be some kind of consensus

33
00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:55.699
that we have to start somewhere. Uh And where

34
00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.489
we start is usually with the most famous democracy

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.750
scholar Robert Dahl, who argues that democracy or poli

36
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:07.620
archy as he calls it consists of seven attributes,

37
00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.839
you need seven attributes in a country before you

38
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.330
can call you self and electoral democracy. And those

39
00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.179
seven are, first of all, you need control over

40
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.559
the government by elected officials. So you elect some

41
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.910
leaders and they could then run the government. That's

42
00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.169
like the first criterion. Um Then you also need

43
00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.339
free and fair elections obviously. So no cheating, no

44
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.350
unfair elections, it should be free and fair elections.

45
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.330
That's the second thing you need in the country.

46
00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.809
You also need the third thing namely inclusive suffrage.

47
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.970
So all adults should be able to, to vote.

48
00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.610
Uh And you also need the right to run

49
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
for office. That's 1/4 thing. So all adults should

50
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.660
be able to run for office if they wish

51
00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.419
to do so. So there should be competition for,

52
00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.460
for power. The fifth is that there should be

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.559
freedom of expression. So you should be able to

54
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.889
say whatever you want. No censorship. Uh AND it

55
00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.220
should also be, this is the sixth freedom of

56
00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.220
information. So you should be allowed to read any

57
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.100
books you want. What's the news you want? Uh

58
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.380
READ newspapers you want, there should be no blocking

59
00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.720
of information. And finally you need freedom of association.

60
00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.539
So if you're dissatisfied and you want to go

61
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.429
protest, you should be allowed to do that. So

62
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.529
this is what we agree on right now is

63
00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.610
like the electoral core of democracy. If you don't

64
00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.259
have these things, then you're not a democracy at

65
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.990
all, then you're an autocracy. But if you have

66
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.960
these seven attributes, then you would be called some

67
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.690
kind of electoral democracy, then you have like the

68
00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.690
core attributes of what you could call a democracy.

69
00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.750
This does not mean that you cannot become even

70
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.080
more democratic. So you could add different dimensions to

71
00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.639
this core element of democracy. So for example, you

72
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.869
could add a liberal component, you could have uh

73
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.250
rule of law, you could have horizontal accountability, then

74
00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.580
you would be a liberal democracy like Denmark, for

75
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.589
example, you could also improve your democracy in terms

76
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.259
of deliberation. So you could be better at discussing

77
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.130
politics among each other. Uh Then you would have

78
00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.059
a more deliberative democracy. You would also have uh

79
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.160
improvements on the participatory dimensions. So more people engage

80
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.649
in democracy, more people engage in voting, in parties

81
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.658
and so on and so forth, then you have

82
00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:21.738
a more participatory democracy. So the idea is that

83
00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:25.308
you have this electoral core, the dials attributes on

84
00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.588
which you can then add other elements to become

85
00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:30.838
even more democratic. But most would agree that if

86
00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:33.898
you don't have these electoral components, then you're not

87
00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:36.098
in democracy. If you have them, then you have

88
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.558
the electoral components of what you would term democracy.

89
00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.239
So I think this is where we have some

90
00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.128
kind of consensus right now.

91
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.190
But aren't there uh a few countries? I mean,

92
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.890
first of all, perhaps I should ask you, is

93
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.899
are there any countries out there which fulfill all

94
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.779
of those criteria? And I if not, I mean,

95
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.390
aren't there perhaps a few countries that we still

96
00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:11.739
consider democratic even though they do not perfectly uh

97
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.100
fulfill all of those criteria?

98
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.140
Yeah, I mean, we have many countries who fulfill

99
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.929
like Daal's criteria, the 71. BUT then when you

100
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.279
add even higher criterias, then it becomes fewer and

101
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.160
fewer countries, right? So there's like a, a reverse

102
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.459
trade off. So uh the more attributes you add

103
00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.799
the less countries, what to these standards, right? Um

104
00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.690
But in general you say that the world's most

105
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.109
democratic countries would be countries like Denmark, Sweden, Norway,

106
00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:47.429
Finland, uh Ireland, Canada, uh countries like this generally

107
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.630
live up to many of these very high standards.

108
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.019
And then you have countries that have some defects

109
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.480
uh but are still very democratic. I mean, uh

110
00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:02.209
UK the US uh Spain Italy, France, Germany who

111
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.200
are also very democratic countries but, but like some,

112
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:07.059
some of these attributes and then of course, you

113
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.140
have countries that are like close to being autocratic

114
00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.309
uh where there's a debate. Is it auto autocracy

115
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.470
now? Is democracy? Uh I mean, Poland Hungary, Turkey,

116
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.929
India, you have these countries that are borderline between

117
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.029
autocracy and democracy. So you have like a whole

118
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.429
specter of countries where for some, you, you know,

119
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.480
these are democratic countries but for others, you, you

120
00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.769
disagree some think they are some think they are

121
00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.239
not. Um And then you clearly have some countries

122
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.420
that are clearly autocratic, right? North Korea, Syria countries

123
00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.140
like that. So there's a spectrum of countries. Uh

124
00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:46.339
SOME are more democratic than others and some we

125
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.519
disagree with uh among each other.

126
00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.399
Yeah, I was just trying to understand if, for

127
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.899
example, a particular country does not uh have all

128
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.359
of those seven basic attributes. If we can still

129
00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:04.279
uh consider it a democracy as I think we

130
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.019
do with some countries, right?

131
00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:10.179
Yeah, I mean, so Dar Dar would say if

132
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.890
you don't have all seven, then you do not

133
00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.579
live up to these standards, right? So take Turkey,

134
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.920
for example, I mean, uh many would take Dar's

135
00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:21.420
criteria and say Turkey is no longer a democracy

136
00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:24.540
because uh you don't have the freedom of information.

137
00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:27.390
You don't have the freedom of expression, for example,

138
00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.809
in Turkey right now. So they have moved from

139
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.929
being a democracy to being an autocracy now. Uh

140
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.760
So that's an example of a country that has

141
00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:36.440
moved in the wrong direction in terms of DAS

142
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.690
attributes. So, so yeah, uh Dal would say you

143
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.450
need all seven before you can call yourself uh

144
00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:45.109
uh what he calls poli achy, but this is

145
00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:47.649
what we would term democracy in our conversation.

146
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.049
So when it comes to understanding uh how and

147
00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:57.809
why people support democratic regimes and I will get

148
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.529
into that into how important is it, it is

149
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.130
for democracies to have the support of their own

150
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.320
citizens. But how do people form democratic support? Do

151
00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:12.010
we know that?

152
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.750
Yeah, I mean, um it also differs in terms

153
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.859
of where you live, right? So if you take

154
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:24.109
old Western democracies, uh many people are just brought

155
00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.670
up by, by democracy, right? They, they have been

156
00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:30.279
internalized throughout their lives. That democracy is the only

157
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.590
game in town. Uh Democracy is the only correct

158
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.330
way to rule a country. Uh So many Western

159
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.380
democracies, democracy hold what we might term intrinsic value.

160
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.020
So it's good in itself. So no matter how

161
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.359
it performs, people think democracy is the only correct

162
00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:50.770
way to govern a society. It's the only socially

163
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.809
accepted form of government basically in newer democracies, in

164
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.729
younger democracies, you don't have this internalization. So here

165
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.419
democracy is more uh instrumental in a way it

166
00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:05.109
relies on performance legitimacy. So as long as it

167
00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:08.979
performs well, people support it. But if it one

168
00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:12.229
day stops performing, then people turn their backs to,

169
00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:15.530
to democracy. So here it's more instrumental, it's a

170
00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:19.000
lighter version of democratic support. So there's this difference

171
00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:22.619
and it depends among other things on whether you

172
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.419
live in an old democracy, like in many Western

173
00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:28.940
countries or whether you have just started living in

174
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.599
a democracy. So it depends on, on that among

175
00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:32.190
other things.

176
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:37.309
So let me ask you about one specific factor

177
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.739
that might play a role here. Uh IS democratic

178
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.539
support influenced in any way by economic experiences in

179
00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:46.659
early life.

180
00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:51.979
Uh Yeah, in general, uh events in early life

181
00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:56.830
are very important for, for your support for democracy.

182
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.619
Uh There are scholars who actually started this in,

183
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.950
in quite interesting projects, for example, as a scholar

184
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.099
from Glasgow and Ginor, together with other colleagues Finkel

185
00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:10.090
and others who have a large project on this.

186
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.289
Uh And what they argue and what they find

187
00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:15.859
is that there is some kind of nostalgia for

188
00:10:15.869 --> 00:10:18.830
the good old days. So uh if you have,

189
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.630
if you're brought up during a period of autocracy,

190
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.909
it could be in Tunisia or Eastern Germany and

191
00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:27.530
you now live in a democracy. Many people for

192
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:29.880
that generation actually think back on the good old

193
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.469
days when things were simpler, more stable, think back

194
00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:35.830
to the autocratic days and actually long for that.

195
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.369
Uh um And you can find the same thing

196
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.299
just in reverse if you was brought up in

197
00:10:41.309 --> 00:10:43.669
a democracy, now, live on autocracy. You could also

198
00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.659
argue that it would be the same pattern. Uh

199
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.020
So basically, the idea is that people long back

200
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.900
to what they had during the childhood. If they

201
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:54.119
had a good experience with that, then they have

202
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.820
this nostri that, that sticks throughout their lives. So

203
00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:02.099
your experiences ear early in your, in your childhood

204
00:11:02.109 --> 00:11:05.150
in your young youth period are very important for,

205
00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:07.349
for how you think about regimes later on in

206
00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:10.789
your life. So there's definitely a close relationship here.

207
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.260
So if in your early years you live in

208
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.520
an autocracy, you can still long for uh going

209
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.539
back to it even though it might have had

210
00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.489
certain issues.

211
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.400
Yeah. So, I mean, so the authors here, they

212
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:31.000
have tested this in Tunisia, for example. Uh Tunisia

213
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.169
is an interesting case because it was for long

214
00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.140
uh an autocracy, right? And then after the Arab

215
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.380
Arab Spring, uh it became a democracy. Uh But

216
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.669
despite this, despite the freedoms that people certainly got

217
00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:47.859
a large proportion of citizens actually long back to

218
00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:50.599
the life they had uh back in the good

219
00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:53.630
old autocratic days, not all, but that's a significant

220
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.849
part who thought this way. Uh So, so, yeah,

221
00:11:56.859 --> 00:11:59.590
despite the fact that democracy brings something, uh uh

222
00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:04.280
some people have this autocratic nostalgia um that we

223
00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:05.450
should be aware of.

224
00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:10.020
Mhm And with that in mind. Uh Of course,

225
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.229
people are worried about this or sometimes worry about

226
00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:19.159
this. I, if uh people, citizens in western democracies

227
00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:23.909
really do support democracy, do we know if they

228
00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.020
do? What do we know about that?

229
00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:29.179
Yeah. So, I mean, that's, that's a good question.

230
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.690
That's also what I research on these days. So

231
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.729
we, if you ask people directly, do you support

232
00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:41.200
democracy? Uh Almost all say yes. Uh So almost

233
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.989
all say yes, I support democracy very much. Um

234
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.070
And I think they actually mean it, I think

235
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.760
it's in, especially in western democracies, it's in people's

236
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.559
core values to support democracy. Uh So people in

237
00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:55.969
western democracies at least want to live in a

238
00:12:55.979 --> 00:12:59.530
democracy, they want freedom, they want all the things

239
00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:01.780
that come with living in a democracy. So people

240
00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:05.190
mean it when they say yes, I support democracy,

241
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.900
but you also have to separate support for democracy

242
00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:13.640
from satisfaction with democracy. Often these things get conflated

243
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.390
because you can easily on the one hand support

244
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.119
democracy and think this is the only way, only

245
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.299
good way to go on a society. And on

246
00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:24.049
the other hand, be very dissatisfied with how it

247
00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:26.390
actually works in your country. Um So you can

248
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.609
support democracy and be dissatisfied with how it works

249
00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:32.500
in your country. You can easily have both intimates.

250
00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:35.690
We need to be careful not to conflate these

251
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.479
two sentiments. Uh You can have one and also

252
00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:41.760
have the other. Uh BUT if you talk about

253
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.780
support for democracy, then yes, during the last 50

254
00:13:45.789 --> 00:13:48.119
years, if you ask people year after year, it's

255
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.159
very, very stable, very, very high. Most people in

256
00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:55.770
western societies support democracy. We demand a lot from

257
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.989
democracy. We are becoming more and more critical. Uh

258
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.260
We hold it to higher, higher esteem. So we

259
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.549
want more and more from it and therefore many

260
00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:06.950
get dissatisfied, but we support democracy. That's very clear.

261
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.510
We want to live in democracy, at least in,

262
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.789
in western societies.

263
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.330
But about the second point, you mentioned there about

264
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.359
people being satisfied or not with democracy. Do we

265
00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:21.849
know anything about that? I mean, because even though

266
00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:25.950
people uh say that they support democracy, do we

267
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.169
know if they are really satisfied with living in

268
00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:33.140
a democratic regime or at least with certain practices

269
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.520
that they see occurring in democracy?

270
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.809
Yes. So that's the thing. So uh many are,

271
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.510
are dissatisfied with democracy but it's actually fewer than

272
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.890
we think. Uh If you look at the uh

273
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.559
the data, at least for Europe for the last

274
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.219
50 years in most countries, satisfaction with democracy goes

275
00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:55.030
up actually. Uh But you don't hear much about

276
00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:58.520
this because the media like to portray the negative

277
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.900
stories. That's the one that's the one people want

278
00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:03.020
to read about and hear about. But it is

279
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.559
actually a positive story that satisfaction with democracy. Although

280
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.169
low in some countries is going up in most

281
00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:13.119
places, we are getting more satisfied uh Despite what

282
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.239
we hear in mainstream media. So, so I think

283
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.190
that's always important to say that yes, democracy has

284
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.960
its problems. We need to keep improving it. We

285
00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:23.599
need to take care of those who are not

286
00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:27.070
satisfied with democracy. But it is a fact that

287
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.679
more and more people in most European democracies at

288
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.270
least are getting more satisfied with democracy. It might

289
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.330
be a different story in other places like in

290
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.880
us and, and in in more developing democracies, but

291
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.260
at least in Europe uh in most countries, people

292
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.010
are getting more satisfied, not less with the democracies.

293
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.260
And I think that's important also to mention.

294
00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:53.270
So that, that's really interesting because many people worry

295
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.960
uh about the rise of certain extreme right wing

296
00:15:57.969 --> 00:16:02.830
parties in certain European countries. And sometimes people point

297
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.570
to things like uh the 2008 economic crisis and

298
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.010
more recently, inflation and also the COVID pandemic and

299
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.609
all of that. And uh they say or suggest

300
00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:17.359
that people uh are not, are no longer that

301
00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:21.044
satisfied with democracy. But according to what you're saying,

302
00:16:21.054 --> 00:16:25.835
across most, at least European countries, even with all

303
00:16:25.844 --> 00:16:28.385
of that over time, people are saying that they

304
00:16:28.395 --> 00:16:31.724
are more satisfied with democracy.

305
00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.265
Actually, we saw a quite sharp dip after the

306
00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:38.445
2008 crisis. So that's important to mention. So in

307
00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:42.135
almost all countries, it went sharply down to 2008

308
00:16:42.145 --> 00:16:45.585
and the following years. But now, given the recoveries

309
00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:48.205
in most countries is rising again. So this is

310
00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:52.210
so that's an important qualification to make that 2008

311
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:56.059
to 2011 12 was a sharp decline in satisfaction

312
00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.260
with democracy across all, almost all countries. But we're

313
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.299
getting back to the level in most countries before

314
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:06.890
the crisis and actually beyond that level. Uh But

315
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.280
it's also important to say, I'm not saying that

316
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.680
there are no problems with democracies, right? I mean,

317
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:14.290
uh we citizens, we we do act uh in

318
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.969
inconsistent ways uh in many ways. So, so my

319
00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:20.050
point here is that the problem is not lack

320
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.979
of support for democracy. The problem is not dissatisfaction

321
00:17:23.989 --> 00:17:27.140
with democracy. The problem is that we as ordinary

322
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.310
citizens are quite inconsistent with our democratic values. So

323
00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:33.829
as I said, when we are asked directly to

324
00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:37.400
support democracy, then we say yes, but when we

325
00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.260
then have to act on this, then we are

326
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:43.229
quite inconsistent. Um uh The scholars who started this

327
00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.170
in a very nice way. Uh The two scholars

328
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.140
from Yale, uh Matt Graham and Milan Soli who,

329
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.560
who in a quite forceful uh high contribution article

330
00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:55.479
showed that people are very inconsistent in terms of

331
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:58.219
the democratic values. Um And what you should try

332
00:17:58.229 --> 00:18:01.180
to imagine here is uh try imagine that your

333
00:18:01.189 --> 00:18:06.520
politician or your party uh is acting undemocratically. So

334
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.079
you have your party, your politician, he or she

335
00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.229
gives you all the policies, you want, you get

336
00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:13.989
taxes, you want, you get the social spending, you

337
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.979
want, you get the immigration policy, you want, you

338
00:18:15.989 --> 00:18:18.390
get the health care, you want, you get the

339
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.109
climate policy, you want, you get everything you want

340
00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:25.810
politically. However, this party of yours is acting undemocratically,

341
00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:29.729
he's violating core democratic rules and norms. Would you

342
00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:33.579
then in this situation, vote for the opposition, would

343
00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:36.390
you reject your party and vote for the opposition?

344
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.209
You should, if you are a Democrat, right? Like

345
00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:41.079
small d Democrat, if you, if you really believe

346
00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:43.790
in democracy, you should punish your party despite all

347
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.160
the politics you get and vote for the opposition.

348
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.260
But the thing is very few will do this.

349
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.329
When push comes to show we are not willing,

350
00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:55.699
at least most are not willing to punish our

351
00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:59.670
parties because we are partisans first and Democrats only

352
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.239
second. So when politics conflict with democracy, then politics

353
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.390
win. And this is a problem in our society

354
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.329
is that we do support democracy, we do, we

355
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.939
are pretty satisfied with it. But when it clashes

356
00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:15.680
with other values like political values, then politics wins.

357
00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:17.939
And this is the problem uh in many Western

358
00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:21.319
democracies that when push comes to show we are

359
00:19:21.329 --> 00:19:24.839
not willing to act consistently on our democratic values.

360
00:19:24.849 --> 00:19:27.260
We are likely to, to put all our values

361
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.739
above democracy, for example, getting the politics we want.

362
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.630
And this is one of the reasons why undemocratic

363
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.459
politicians can get away with it because their voters

364
00:19:36.469 --> 00:19:39.150
don't punish them because politics is more important for

365
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.680
most.

366
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.170
So, that's one of the main reasons why sometimes

367
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.479
people support undemocratic behavior.

368
00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:52.930
Yeah, definitely. So, uh, if Trump does something, uh,

369
00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:56.500
well then, uh, Trump voters, they, they will just

370
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.069
accept it because, uh, they, they will never vote

371
00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:01.510
for the Democrats. Politics is more important for them

372
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.119
than, than, uh, getting the democracy. Right. Uh, AND

373
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.859
this goes for both sides. It's not just a

374
00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:08.979
right wing thing. Uh It's both on the left

375
00:20:08.989 --> 00:20:12.680
and the right. We are willing to uh accept

376
00:20:12.689 --> 00:20:15.380
undemocratic behavior from our politicians as long as we

377
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.569
get the policies we want because that's more important

378
00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:20.050
for us. Um And that's one of the main

379
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.380
challenges in in western democracies. Um And then people

380
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.239
can ask, so how can people live with themselves?

381
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.869
How can they cope with this situation? Right? Uh

382
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.599
And people have many coping mechanisms to, to accept

383
00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.209
that they do what they do. Um And a

384
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:40.010
lot of research have examined how people actually deal

385
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.199
with this tense situation. It must be to accept

386
00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:46.880
an undemocratic politician. Uh If I should just mention

387
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:52.089
41 reason would be simply the people acknowledge, yes,

388
00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:55.920
I'm supporting an undemocratic candidate, but this candidate or

389
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.329
this party gives me the policies I want. So

390
00:20:58.339 --> 00:20:59.939
you just do it with open eyes, you just

391
00:20:59.949 --> 00:21:02.770
accept that politics is more important for you than

392
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.280
democracy. That's one way to, to cope with this

393
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.939
just to do it with, with eyes wide open

394
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.680
a second opportunity. A possibility is to rationalize what

395
00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:15.689
you mean by democracy and non democracy. So this

396
00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:18.449
is what I do in my research. So what

397
00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:20.770
I find is that when people are confronted with

398
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.180
undemocratic behavior from their side, so again, imagine your

399
00:21:24.189 --> 00:21:28.719
party or your politician acting undemocratically, then most people

400
00:21:28.729 --> 00:21:32.180
will actually just argue that this is not undemocratic.

401
00:21:32.189 --> 00:21:35.310
They rationalize, they tell themselves that this behavior that

402
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.390
objectively might be undemocratic. They convince themselves that this

403
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.670
is not undemocratic. It, it follows all democratic rules

404
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.989
and norms. So they are not uh selling democracy

405
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.469
to get policy. They're actually getting both democracy and

406
00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:52.459
politics because it's not undemocratic. So they keep simply

407
00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:56.479
rationalized and tell themselves that a certain undemocratic behavior

408
00:21:56.489 --> 00:22:02.329
is perfectly democratic. A third way is to accept

409
00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:06.589
that yes, I am supporting uh an undemocratic candidate,

410
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.119
but I'm not voting for the opposition because they

411
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.449
will be even worse. Uh If I vote for

412
00:22:12.459 --> 00:22:15.530
the opposition, then they would violate democracy even more

413
00:22:15.739 --> 00:22:18.280
and then democracy is doomed. So I support my

414
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.930
candidate despite his or her flaws because the other

415
00:22:21.939 --> 00:22:24.270
side would be even more undemocratic. It would be

416
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.530
even worse for democracy. So I'm kind of saving

417
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.920
democracy by sticking to my candidate. That's the third

418
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.859
way people cope with this by telling themselves that

419
00:22:32.869 --> 00:22:36.819
the other side is worse. 1/4 and final way

420
00:22:36.829 --> 00:22:40.319
they can cope with. This is by uh telling

421
00:22:40.329 --> 00:22:43.060
themselves that democracy is very strong. I mean, at

422
00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:46.569
least in western democracies, people don't think many don't

423
00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:48.589
think that their democracies can break down. I mean,

424
00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:50.130
they've been used to living in democracy for their

425
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.189
whole lives so they don't know how fragile democracy

426
00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:56.170
is in reality. Uh So by telling yourself that

427
00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.119
democracy is strong, uh you can easily accept supporting

428
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.790
one or two undemocratic candidates, right? It doesn't matter.

429
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.560
Uh DEMOCRACY will, will stay despite the fact that

430
00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:07.969
you vote for this undemocratic candidate. Uh So that's

431
00:23:07.979 --> 00:23:10.689
like the fourth way to cope with this situation

432
00:23:10.699 --> 00:23:13.949
is by telling yourself that democracy can with uh

433
00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:18.310
withstand these candidates without any problems. Democracy is strong

434
00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:22.339
voting once or twice for this candidate does not

435
00:23:22.349 --> 00:23:25.530
make a difference. So, so there are many coping

436
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.750
mechanisms, these are just four of them, but uh

437
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.270
they show how people can uh live with themselves

438
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.219
despite the fact that they vote for un democratic

439
00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:36.439
candidates from time to time. So

440
00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:43.079
people are good at rationalizing their inconsistent positions to

441
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.060
democracy.

442
00:23:44.449 --> 00:23:46.390
Yeah, there are many ways to, to do so.

443
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:46.640
Yeah.

444
00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:51.310
So uh it's one thing for people to support

445
00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:55.020
democracy and be satisfied or not with it to

446
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:59.339
different degrees. But uh one thing that uh some

447
00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:02.270
people also suggest is for us to try to

448
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.619
intervene and improve citizens democratic values. I mean, is

449
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.010
it possible to do that? At least from a

450
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.550
scientific perspective. Are there any evidence-based interventions out there?

451
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.040
Uh There are few, but we don't know much

452
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.640
about this right now. So we are slowly getting

453
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.719
the diagnosis. Right. Right. So we are slowly understanding

454
00:24:26.729 --> 00:24:29.520
what the problem is. Uh But we are very,

455
00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:32.699
it's very early days for the intervention research. Uh

456
00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:35.500
It's right now, people are trying to work on

457
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.170
this, trying to find out. So what can we

458
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.640
do about it? How can we make people not

459
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.160
vote for democratic candidates? How can we make people

460
00:24:42.209 --> 00:24:46.339
stick to the democratic core values? Um uh So

461
00:24:46.349 --> 00:24:48.000
we don't know much about it right now. Uh

462
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.050
We know a bit and I can explain that

463
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.900
to you. So one thing we can do at

464
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.130
least on the long term, uh it's education, right?

465
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.099
So back to the and Neo and Finkel and

466
00:24:59.109 --> 00:25:02.329
those uh those guys in that team, they show

467
00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:06.449
that civic education, democracy, education actually works. Uh You

468
00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:10.839
can educate people in understanding democracy, valuing democracy uh

469
00:25:10.849 --> 00:25:13.719
preferably at an early age in their lives. And

470
00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:15.729
that actually works in terms of getting people to

471
00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:18.540
become more democratic later in life. Uh This is

472
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.489
like the long term intervention, right? Uh We can

473
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.770
also do something on the short term now and

474
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.790
here. Uh But this is where we really don't

475
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.530
know much. Uh For example, there's this quite impressive

476
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.829
mega study done by a team from Stanford University.

477
00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:38.760
Uh uh Wil Robb Willer and colleagues, what they

478
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.780
did is that they acknowledged that we don't know

479
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.010
anything about this. So they invited scholars, ordinary citizens

480
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:50.359
practitioners to submit intervention suggestions to them. Uh They

481
00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:54.510
got more than 400 then they chose the 25

482
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.609
best or most promising interventions and tried to test

483
00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:59.640
them in the real world or test them in,

484
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.640
in a big online sample of uh representative sample

485
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.699
of Americans to see which of these 25 interventions

486
00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:12.420
worked. Unfortunately. Uh So almost all of these interventions

487
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.449
worked in all the outcomes. They worked in terms

488
00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:18.609
of reducing polarization, for example. So that's great but

489
00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:22.699
almost non worked in terms of improving democratic norms,

490
00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:25.810
almost non worked in terms of making people stick

491
00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:29.920
to democracy uh and reject on democratic behavior. Uh

492
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.140
So that's a sad story, a sad part of

493
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.650
it. And it shows that we know very little

494
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.790
about this. Um There were two interventions that worked.

495
00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:41.130
Uh ONE that worked was by telling people or

496
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.339
by like correcting the misbelief about the other side.

497
00:26:44.349 --> 00:26:46.439
So telling them that the other side is not

498
00:26:46.449 --> 00:26:48.369
worse. So as I told before, this is one

499
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.670
of the coping mechanisms, we support undemocratic behavior because

500
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.189
we think the other side is worse and therefore

501
00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:56.760
we stick to our candidate. But this is not

502
00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.339
the case. I mean, the other side is not

503
00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:00.890
worse. Uh This, these are the facts that show

504
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.599
this. So uh our political opponents are not more

505
00:27:03.609 --> 00:27:06.089
undemocratic than we are. They are as democratic and

506
00:27:06.099 --> 00:27:08.689
like democracy as much as we do. And if

507
00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:10.630
people are being told this, if people are being

508
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.349
told that the other side is not worse, they

509
00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:15.579
love democracy as much as you do, then you

510
00:27:15.589 --> 00:27:19.349
yourself become less willing to support undemocratic behavior. Um

511
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:21.180
And that actually works. So that's an intervention that

512
00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:24.750
works to, to tell people that uh we all

513
00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:27.890
appreciate to live in democracy and therefore we should

514
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.839
stick to it. So by telling that the other

515
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:32.900
side is not worse, you yourself become less uh

516
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.150
undemocratic in a sense. Another intervention that worked uh

517
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.750
uh is related to the the last force coping

518
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.660
mechanism, namely this idea that democracy is strong and

519
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.290
and not fragile because what they did here is

520
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.349
that they showed a, a bunch of videos to

521
00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:53.569
respond. Uh A bunch of videos showing democracies in

522
00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:58.069
trouble. So democracy being attacked by coups, uh January

523
00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.560
6th footage uh stuff like that. So showing a

524
00:28:00.569 --> 00:28:04.069
lot of videos of democracies in troubles. Uh AND

525
00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:06.439
what this had an effect was that it showed

526
00:28:06.449 --> 00:28:10.839
that democracies are not immune to these kind of

527
00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:14.079
troubles, it could happen in your country. And after

528
00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:16.989
watching these videos, the treatment group were less willing

529
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.329
to support violations of democracy compared to the control

530
00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:23.020
group. So it also worked in terms of improving

531
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.239
our democratic norms. So these are like the two

532
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.310
interventions so far we know works but apart from

533
00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:31.410
this, we know very little about how we can

534
00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.160
make people stick to the democratic values. So we

535
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.719
need to do more research and maybe in one

536
00:28:37.729 --> 00:28:39.920
or two years, uh I can tell you more

537
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.560
about this.

538
00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:44.140
Yeah. Uh But do you have any idea about

539
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:49.810
exactly what kind of research we would need specifically

540
00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:54.150
and what kind of knowledge we, we would need

541
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.469
to have when it comes to developing more and

542
00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:04.670
better science based interventions to improving uh citizens, democratic

543
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.339
values.

544
00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:09.969
Yeah. So I personally, I think we should focus

545
00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:13.069
on the coping mechanisms, right? So we need to

546
00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.869
take them one at a time and say, OK,

547
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.239
how do people cope with the fact that they

548
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.650
support on democratic candidates? And then we should try

549
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.130
to block these coping mechanisms, right? So those two

550
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.040
that worked, worked in terms of one of these

551
00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.630
four coping mechanisms I showed you. So that would

552
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.469
be my suggestion to start with how do people

553
00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:36.750
overcome this dilemma and then try to block that

554
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.839
ability to overcome that dilemma. So they have to

555
00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:41.550
reject our democratic behavior because we want people to

556
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.430
act democratically, right? Uh I think that's one way

557
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.290
another way is also to acknowledge that this is

558
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.219
not a fringe phenomenon. We have this idea that

559
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.189
those citizens who do this are on the flanks.

560
00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:56.839
Like I say, extreme citizens on the right wing

561
00:29:56.849 --> 00:29:59.000
or extreme left. These are the people we need

562
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.020
to educate, right? But research showed that this is

563
00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.719
you and me, I mean, ordinary citizens, uh we

564
00:30:04.729 --> 00:30:06.750
all do this from time to time. We all

565
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.280
have these biases inherent in us. So we shouldn't

566
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.280
think that this is something other people do. We

567
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.020
do it ourselves. We need to acknowledge that this

568
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.010
is a mass phenomenon we like if not all,

569
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.300
then most of us are inconsistent when push comes

570
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.619
to show and we need to acknowledge this. So

571
00:30:23.869 --> 00:30:27.790
intervention should be aimed at the broad population, not

572
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.930
just those on the fringes, you could easily think

573
00:30:30.939 --> 00:30:36.920
that. And then yeah, we need uh clear control

574
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.979
treatment trials. Uh So what people do right now

575
00:30:39.989 --> 00:30:42.449
is online surveys. I think we should, we need

576
00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:44.099
more of that. So we have a control group

577
00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:46.489
and then we have a treatment group who undergo

578
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.310
one kind of treatment. So it could be watching

579
00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:51.099
a video or, or reading some kind of information

580
00:30:51.109 --> 00:30:54.530
or, or doing something else and then to see

581
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.670
the effects compared to the control group. So we

582
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.969
need more of that kind of studies in order

583
00:30:58.979 --> 00:31:01.459
to be smart on this very important topic.

584
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.109
So uh uh when it comes to people satisfaction,

585
00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:09.170
satisfaction with democracy, I would like to ask you

586
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.439
one specific question. So uh do we know if

587
00:31:12.449 --> 00:31:18.329
national elections are unequivocally good for that? For people's

588
00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:20.079
satisfaction with democracy?

589
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:25.880
That's a good question because uh uh one solution

590
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.530
many people suggest is to make citizens participate more

591
00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.969
on democracy. There's this idea that the more participation,

592
00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:35.589
the better. Uh BUT I'm not sure this is

593
00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:37.510
the right way to go and you see this

594
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.829
with national elections because it, it all depends on

595
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.680
the experiences you have when you participate in the

596
00:31:43.689 --> 00:31:47.800
democratic process, if you have good experiences, then that

597
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.199
sentiment sticks in the years to come and you

598
00:31:50.209 --> 00:31:53.239
become more satisfied with democracy. If you had bad

599
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.780
experiences, last time you participated in the democratic process,

600
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.150
then that bad sentiment sticks and you get more

601
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.050
dissatisfied with democracy and you see this with the

602
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.660
elections. So if your last election took place during

603
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.000
uh uh economic growth period, then you are more

604
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.359
satisfied with democracy in the years to come regardless

605
00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:16.349
of how the economy performs afterwards. On the other

606
00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:19.550
hand, last time you went to the polls, if

607
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.790
there was a period of economic crisis and you

608
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.239
had a bad experience that day, you, you had

609
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.959
bad sentiment when you participate in democracy, then that

610
00:32:26.969 --> 00:32:29.699
bad feeling sticks in the years to come again,

611
00:32:29.729 --> 00:32:33.060
regardless of how the economy performs. So it all

612
00:32:33.069 --> 00:32:35.540
depends, it depends on whether you had good or

613
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.790
bad experiences. Last time you participated in the democratic

614
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.140
process and that sentiment is likely to stick until

615
00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.989
next time you, you go vote for example. So,

616
00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.310
so it all depends.

617
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.479
Uh YOU mentioned economic crisis there and earlier in

618
00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:54.680
our conversation, uh I brought to the table the

619
00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:59.500
2008 economic crisis very briefly. So why is it

620
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:05.180
that sometimes economic crisis lead to democratic breakdown and

621
00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:06.800
sometimes they don't.

622
00:33:07.939 --> 00:33:10.969
Yeah. So economic crisis is probably one of the

623
00:33:11.319 --> 00:33:15.599
most destabilizing events we know of uh in terms

624
00:33:15.609 --> 00:33:18.520
of regime stability. Uh AND one of the reasons

625
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.339
is at least in, in, in many places around

626
00:33:22.349 --> 00:33:26.030
the world, people want basic necessities, right? I mean,

627
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.869
they want to have a job, they want to

628
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.160
be able to provide for the families, they want

629
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.410
to uh have a decent living basically. And during

630
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.579
an economic crisis, these things are, are threatened, you

631
00:33:39.589 --> 00:33:42.030
might lose your job, you might not be able

632
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.959
to put food on the table to provide for

633
00:33:43.969 --> 00:33:46.560
your family. And when that happened, you turn your

634
00:33:46.569 --> 00:33:49.119
anger towards the regime and it goes both ways,

635
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.750
both for autocracies and democracies. Uh YOU get dissatisfied

636
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.079
and maybe you even will challenge the regime. Maybe

637
00:33:56.089 --> 00:33:58.510
you go to the street in a protest or

638
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.300
at least you don't do anything if others try

639
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.579
to topple the regime. So economic crisis are perhaps

640
00:34:03.589 --> 00:34:07.780
the most destabilizing events because it makes people very

641
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.719
angry and very dissatisfied with whatever regime they have.

642
00:34:11.408 --> 00:34:16.039
Mhm. And what other factors apart from economic crisis?

643
00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:19.108
Explain democratic breakdown.

644
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.280
Yes, I mean, uh age I think is uh

645
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:28.708
perhaps one of the strongest expenditure factors. So the

646
00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.110
older the democracy, the more stable it is the

647
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.228
younger the democracy, the more unstable and more likely

648
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.280
to break down. It is uh so regime stability

649
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:43.149
take many years to, to kind of build up.

650
00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.429
Um uh A good example is uh the interwar

651
00:34:46.438 --> 00:34:49.310
period. So the period between the 1st and 2nd

652
00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.529
World War, uh so at the end of the

653
00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:55.089
first world war, almost all countries in Europe were

654
00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:59.458
democracies. When the second world war started, half of

655
00:34:59.468 --> 00:35:01.968
the continent's democracies broke down. So it's a very,

656
00:35:01.979 --> 00:35:05.718
very neat laboratory to understand why some democracies broke

657
00:35:05.729 --> 00:35:08.718
down while others didn't. And what we see here

658
00:35:08.729 --> 00:35:12.479
is that all those countries, all those democracies that

659
00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:15.549
were democracy prior to First World War. So we

660
00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:19.989
could call them relatively old democracies. They all survived

661
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.229
without exception, all those who broke down were new

662
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:28.270
democracies. So countries that only became democracy after first

663
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.129
World war, Germany, uh Italy, Spain uh countries like

664
00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:36.199
that. Um um Not to say that all young

665
00:35:36.209 --> 00:35:39.040
democracies broke down. We had some young democracies who

666
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:42.500
survived uh Finland, for example. Uh But it is

667
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.889
a very, very strong relationship. Um So the age

668
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:49.310
of democracy or autocracy is very important, the older

669
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.790
you are, the more stable you are basically. Um

670
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.510
So that's uh that's important to know. Uh Then

671
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.929
of course, economic crisis as we talked about. Uh

672
00:35:57.399 --> 00:36:00.000
BUT having a stable party system and strong civil

673
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.639
society is also a good thing if you want

674
00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:06.310
a stable democracy. Um And then I think it's

675
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.290
also important to mention external influence. So uh if

676
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.449
you are in a democratic neighborhood, if you have

677
00:36:12.459 --> 00:36:15.750
a good democratic superpower next to you, that also

678
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.889
makes your country more democratic. Uh On the other

679
00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:20.889
hand, if you have like an autocratic superpower next

680
00:36:20.899 --> 00:36:24.399
door, like like China or Russia, then it's much

681
00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:26.719
harder for you all to say, sustain your democracy

682
00:36:26.729 --> 00:36:30.139
because then you have this autocratic influence coming every

683
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:35.000
day constantly from this autocratic superpower. So geography and

684
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.310
international factors also matters a lot in terms of

685
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.679
your survival chances.

686
00:36:39.879 --> 00:36:43.959
So just a second ago, when I asked you

687
00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:47.149
about the effects of economic crisis, you also mentioned

688
00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:51.219
there that even in autocracies, they can sometimes lead

689
00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:56.800
to regime instability. So, but what happens specifically when

690
00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:01.629
autocratic leaders are exposed to economic crisis or how

691
00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:03.219
do they deal with it?

692
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.429
Yes, in many ways, it's kind of the same

693
00:37:06.439 --> 00:37:10.139
scenario, right? I mean, uh if an autocracy is

694
00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:14.419
experiencing crisis, they also face dissatisfaction from their citizens

695
00:37:14.429 --> 00:37:16.899
because they want the same thing. Uh People still

696
00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:19.590
want bread on the table to provide for the

697
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.610
families a decent job. Uh So they also get

698
00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:27.409
the same challenges. Uh Often it is in different

699
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:31.479
ways because autopsies are better at uh uh suppressing,

700
00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:34.169
at least tough autopsies are better at suppressing the

701
00:37:34.179 --> 00:37:37.020
center from below. Uh uh But perhaps they are

702
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.850
more vulnerable to other types of breakdowns like coups,

703
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.199
for example. So historically, coups has been the number

704
00:37:43.209 --> 00:37:46.320
one way to, to topple many, many regimes around

705
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.310
the world. Uh So the leaders removed from by

706
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.909
the military or all those within the state. So

707
00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:55.500
the point is they are also vulnerable during times

708
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.959
of economic crisis, but they can also shield themselves.

709
00:37:57.969 --> 00:38:00.409
I mean, democracies don't break down every time there's

710
00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:03.189
a crisis and likewise, autocracies don't break down every

711
00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:06.000
time there's a crisis, they can shield themselves. For

712
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.239
example, if they have natural resources, uh oil, uh

713
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:13.219
diamonds, stuff like that, then they ensure this constant

714
00:38:13.229 --> 00:38:16.179
flow of money despite being in an economic crisis.

715
00:38:16.189 --> 00:38:18.189
And if they have this constant flow of money,

716
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.879
then they can still pay off the core supporters

717
00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:23.780
of the regime and stay stable despite the crisis.

718
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:27.770
So some autocracies are very stable despite the fact

719
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.750
that they might have a crisis, especially if they

720
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.629
have other sources of income, natural resource being one

721
00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:35.080
of the most important ones.

722
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.530
Mhm. So, I mean, when it comes to shielding

723
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:44.610
themselves from, for example, revolutions, coups and assassination attempts,

724
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.520
it's um uh many times a matter of having

725
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.360
enough resources to do it.

726
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.550
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And preferably resources that are unrelated

727
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.530
to the broad society. So no matter whether you're

728
00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.629
having a crisis or not, you'll get your oil

729
00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:04.340
income, right? I mean, uh oil country still need

730
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.760
to buy the oil. So it's relatively unrelated to

731
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.340
an economic crisis where you get your oil income

732
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.110
or not. Uh So having this source of income

733
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.209
that is unrelated to the broader societal economy, that's

734
00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:19.909
preferable as an autocrat because then you ensure a

735
00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:21.969
stable inflow of money that you can use to

736
00:39:21.979 --> 00:39:25.790
pay off your key supporters uh during this tough

737
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.939
time. So that's a very important shield.

738
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.760
OK. So Doctor Krishna Rayan, uh just before we

739
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.590
go, uh I, I mean, e even before I

740
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.280
ask you, where can people find you on the

741
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.189
internet? Would you like to tell us what are

742
00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:44.320
you working on at the moment and what work

743
00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.479
you will be doing in the near future?

744
00:39:47.649 --> 00:39:51.120
Yes, I'm actually working on this intervention aspect. As

745
00:39:51.129 --> 00:39:53.330
I said, we don't know much about what can

746
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.129
we do about this situation, right? In democracies, especially

747
00:39:57.139 --> 00:40:00.060
in western democracies, the fact that people are very

748
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.629
inconsistent, they say they value democracy, but then they

749
00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:07.969
still support undemocratic candidates and many does. So how

750
00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:11.050
can we intervene and prevent this from happening? So

751
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.199
this is what I'm working on right now. Uh

752
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.290
And this very early days also in my research,

753
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.770
so I don't have any concrete results right now,

754
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.260
perhaps in a year or two. But I'm also,

755
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.530
I've also jumped into this question right now because

756
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.479
I think it's one of the most uh important

757
00:40:27.489 --> 00:40:30.580
and vital questions to ask uh in democracies today,

758
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.429
how can we help people? How can we empower

759
00:40:33.439 --> 00:40:36.100
people to resist undemocratic behavior? So this is what

760
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.500
I do right now.

761
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.449
OK. And where can people find your work on

762
00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:42.270
the internet.

763
00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:45.709
Uh I mean, I have my web page student

764
00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:48.179
dot DK. Uh So it's just my name dot

765
00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:51.500
DK so that uh uh that should be straightforward.

766
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.949
I have all my papers articles in there. Um

767
00:40:55.149 --> 00:40:58.000
And then also at the conferences, uh I'm going

768
00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.320
to, to Glasgow for IP S A conference uh

769
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.399
uh in June. Uh So, yeah, there, I'm also

770
00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:08.000
available. Um I write me an email.

771
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.340
