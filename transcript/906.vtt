00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.189
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.929
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loops.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.948
And today I'm joined by Doctor Sudan Krishna Ryan.

4
00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:13.460
He is associate professor in Political Science at a University

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.190
in Denmark. His research agenda seeks to understand and

6
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.530
explain political regime instability. And today we're going to

7
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.298
talk about democratic regimes, autocratic regimes, their instability

8
00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:33.750
and stability and citizen support for democracy. So Doctor

9
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:36.189
Krish Krishna Rayan, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.590
a big pleasure to everyone. Yeah. Thanks for

11
00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:41.950
, for having me and thank you Ricardo for,

12
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.029
for doing this show. I think it's important that

13
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.270
we disseminate our research to, to a broad audience

14
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:50.450
. Uh and series like yours are a vital part

15
00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.270
of this. So, so thank you as well

16
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.348
. Well, thank you for the kind words and

17
00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.539
it's my pleasure. So let me start by asking

18
00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:00.899
you a basic question, I guess. So,

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.230
from the perspective of political science, what is democracy

20
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.549
? I mean, how does a political scientist define

21
00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:15.430
democracy? Yeah, that's uh probably one of the

22
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.388
, the toughest questions to ask because there are almost

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.909
as many definitions of democracy as you have scholars of

24
00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:26.180
democracy, people disagree heavily about what is democracy,

25
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.888
how should we define this very contested concept? Um

26
00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:33.909
I think in its, in its broadest sense,

27
00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:37.028
you would argue that democracy is ruled by the people

28
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.969
, right? So you and me, ordinary citizens

29
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.528
, we decide who our leaders are. Um But

30
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.209
beyond this very general understanding, people disagree heavily about

31
00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.969
what is democracy. Uh Right now, there seems

32
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.808
to be some kind of consensus that we have to

33
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.959
start somewhere. Uh And where we start is usually

34
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.019
with the most famous democracy scholar Robert Dahl, who

35
00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:04.859
argues that democracy or poli archy as he calls it

36
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.960
consists of seven attributes, you need seven attributes in

37
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.349
a country before you can call you self and electoral

38
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.689
democracy. And those seven are, first of all

39
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.899
, you need control over the government by elected officials

40
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.808
. So you elect some leaders and they could then

41
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.490
run the government. That's like the first criterion.

42
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.788
Um Then you also need free and fair elections obviously

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.278
. So no cheating, no unfair elections, it

44
00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:30.960
should be free and fair elections. That's the second

45
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.889
thing you need in the country. You also need

46
00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.278
the third thing namely inclusive suffrage. So all adults

47
00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:39.500
should be able to, to vote. Uh And

48
00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:42.118
you also need the right to run for office.

49
00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.000
That's 1/4 thing. So all adults should be able

50
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:46.258
to run for office if they wish to do so

51
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.409
. So there should be competition for, for power

52
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.058
. The fifth is that there should be freedom of

53
00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.679
expression. So you should be able to say whatever

54
00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.050
you want. No censorship. Uh and it should

55
00:02:59.058 --> 00:03:00.979
also be, this is the sixth freedom of information

56
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.580
. So you should be allowed to read any books

57
00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:07.099
you want. What's the news you want? Uh

58
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.379
read newspapers you want, there should be no blocking

59
00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.719
of information. And finally you need freedom of association

60
00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:15.538
. So if you're dissatisfied and you want to go

61
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.500
protest, you should be allowed to do that.

62
00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.528
So this is what we agree on right now is

63
00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:23.610
like the electoral core of democracy. If you don't

64
00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:25.258
have these things, then you're not a democracy at

65
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.788
all, then you're an autocracy. But if you

66
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.808
have these seven attributes, then you would be called

67
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.580
some kind of electoral democracy, then you have like

68
00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:38.689
the core attributes of what you could call a democracy

69
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.750
. This does not mean that you cannot become even

70
00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:45.080
more democratic. So you could add different dimensions to

71
00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:46.550
this core element of democracy. So for example,

72
00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:50.849
you could add a liberal component, you could have

73
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.778
uh rule of law, you could have horizontal accountability

74
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.278
, then you would be a liberal democracy like Denmark

75
00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.210
, for example, you could also improve your democracy

76
00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.569
in terms of deliberation. So you could be better

77
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.758
at discussing politics among each other. Uh Then you

78
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.849
would have a more deliberative democracy. You would also

79
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.300
have uh improvements on the participatory dimensions. So more

80
00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.770
people engage in democracy, more people engage in voting

81
00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:16.730
, in parties and so on and so forth,

82
00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:20.177
then you have a more participatory democracy. So the

83
00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:23.648
idea is that you have this electoral core, the

84
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.139
dials attributes on which you can then add other elements

85
00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:30.509
to become even more democratic. But most would agree

86
00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:32.569
that if you don't have these electoral components, then

87
00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.427
you're not in democracy. If you have them,

88
00:04:34.437 --> 00:04:38.127
then you have the electoral components of what you would

89
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.829
term democracy. So I think this is where we

90
00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:46.600
have some kind of consensus right now. But aren't

91
00:04:46.608 --> 00:04:48.588
there uh a few countries? I mean, first

92
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.889
of all, perhaps I should ask you, is

93
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:58.269
are there any countries out there which fulfill all of

94
00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:00.778
those criteria? And I if not, I mean

95
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.389
, aren't there perhaps a few countries that we still

96
00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:12.579
consider democratic even though they do not perfectly uh fulfill

97
00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:15.660
all of those criteria? Yeah, I mean,

98
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.608
we have many countries who fulfill like Daal's criteria,

99
00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:23.428
the 71. but then when you add even higher

100
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.869
criterias, then it becomes fewer and fewer countries,

101
00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.619
right? So there's like a, a reverse trade

102
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.759
off. So uh the more attributes you add the

103
00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:33.379
less countries, what to these standards, right?

104
00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.689
Um But in general you say that the world's most

105
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.220
democratic countries would be countries like Denmark, Sweden,

106
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.819
Norway, Finland, uh Ireland, Canada, uh

107
00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:48.319
countries like this generally live up to many of these

108
00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:51.238
very high standards. And then you have countries that

109
00:05:51.588 --> 00:05:56.600
have some defects uh but are still very democratic.

110
00:05:56.608 --> 00:06:00.410
I mean, uh UK the US uh Spain Italy

111
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.579
, France, Germany who are also very democratic countries

112
00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:05.350
but, but like some, some of these attributes

113
00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:08.319
and then of course, you have countries that are

114
00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.220
like close to being autocratic uh where there's a debate

115
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.980
. Is it auto autocracy now? Is democracy?

116
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.988
Uh I mean, Poland Hungary, Turkey, India

117
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.480
, you have these countries that are borderline between autocracy

118
00:06:21.488 --> 00:06:24.428
and democracy. So you have like a whole specter

119
00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.428
of countries where for some, you, you know

120
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.250
, these are democratic countries but for others, you

121
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:31.689
, you disagree some think they are some think they

122
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.829
are not. Um And then you clearly have some

123
00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:39.139
countries that are clearly autocratic, right? North Korea

124
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.399
, Syria countries like that. So there's a spectrum

125
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.519
of countries. Uh some are more democratic than others

126
00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:47.519
and some we disagree with uh among each other.

127
00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.040
Yeah, I was just trying to understand if,

128
00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:55.488
for example, a particular country does not uh have

129
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.519
all of those seven basic attributes. If we can

130
00:06:59.528 --> 00:07:03.278
still uh consider it a democracy as I think we

131
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.259
do with some countries, right? Yeah, I

132
00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.500
mean, so Dar Dar would say if you don't

133
00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.189
have all seven, then you do not live up

134
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.579
to these standards, right? So take Turkey,

135
00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:17.600
for example, I mean, uh many would take

136
00:07:17.858 --> 00:07:20.420
Dar's criteria and say Turkey is no longer a democracy

137
00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:24.540
because uh you don't have the freedom of information.

138
00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:27.389
You don't have the freedom of expression, for example

139
00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.639
, in Turkey right now. So they have moved

140
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:30.910
from being a democracy to being an autocracy now.

141
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.759
Uh So that's an example of a country that has

142
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.160
moved in the wrong direction in terms of DAS attributes

143
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.548
. So, so yeah, uh Dal would say

144
00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.449
you need all seven before you can call yourself uh

145
00:07:43.048 --> 00:07:45.108
uh what he calls poli achy, but this is

146
00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:48.569
what we would term democracy in our conversation. So

147
00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:54.579
when it comes to understanding uh how and why people

148
00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:59.250
support democratic regimes and I will get into that into

149
00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.040
how important is it, it is for democracies to

150
00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:07.119
have the support of their own citizens. But how

151
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:11.009
do people form democratic support? Do we know that

152
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.139
? Yeah, I mean, um it also differs

153
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.608
in terms of where you live, right? So

154
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:22.540
if you take old Western democracies, uh many people

155
00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:26.278
are just brought up by, by democracy, right

156
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.100
? They, they have been internalized throughout their lives

157
00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:31.290
. That democracy is the only game in town.

158
00:08:31.298 --> 00:08:33.288
Uh Democracy is the only correct way to rule a

159
00:08:33.298 --> 00:08:37.779
country. Uh So many Western democracies, democracy hold

160
00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:41.969
what we might term intrinsic value. So it's good

161
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.979
in itself. So no matter how it performs,

162
00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:48.149
people think democracy is the only correct way to govern

163
00:08:48.158 --> 00:08:50.529
a society. It's the only socially accepted form of

164
00:08:50.538 --> 00:08:54.619
government basically in newer democracies, in younger democracies,

165
00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:58.908
you don't have this internalization. So here democracy is

166
00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:03.599
more uh instrumental in a way it relies on performance

167
00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.450
legitimacy. So as long as it performs well,

168
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.830
people support it. But if it one day stops

169
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.349
performing, then people turn their backs to, to

170
00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:15.529
democracy. So here it's more instrumental, it's a

171
00:09:15.538 --> 00:09:18.000
lighter version of democratic support. So there's this difference

172
00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:22.859
and it depends among other things on whether you live

173
00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:26.109
in an old democracy, like in many Western countries

174
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.750
or whether you have just started living in a democracy

175
00:09:28.908 --> 00:09:31.820
. So it depends on, on that among other

176
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.460
things. So let me ask you about one specific

177
00:09:35.469 --> 00:09:39.019
factor that might play a role here. Uh is

178
00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:45.538
democratic support influenced in any way by economic experiences in

179
00:09:45.548 --> 00:09:50.460
early life. Uh Yeah, in general, uh

180
00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:54.479
events in early life are very important for, for

181
00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:58.548
your support for democracy. Uh There are scholars who

182
00:09:58.558 --> 00:10:00.928
actually started this in, in quite interesting projects,

183
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.500
for example, as a scholar from Glasgow and Ginor

184
00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:07.408
, together with other colleagues Finkel and others who have

185
00:10:07.418 --> 00:10:11.190
a large project on this. Uh And what they

186
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.820
argue and what they find is that there is some

187
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.340
kind of nostalgia for the good old days. So

188
00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:20.330
uh if you have, if you're brought up during

189
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.048
a period of autocracy, it could be in Tunisia

190
00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:26.538
or Eastern Germany and you now live in a democracy

191
00:10:26.678 --> 00:10:28.340
. Many people for that generation actually think back on

192
00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:31.658
the good old days when things were simpler, more

193
00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:33.869
stable, think back to the autocratic days and actually

194
00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:37.750
long for that. Uh um And you can find

195
00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:41.048
the same thing just in reverse if you was brought

196
00:10:41.058 --> 00:10:43.200
up in a democracy, now, live on autocracy

197
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:43.538
. You could also argue that it would be the

198
00:10:43.548 --> 00:10:46.428
same pattern. Uh So basically, the idea is

199
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.279
that people long back to what they had during the

200
00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:52.379
childhood. If they had a good experience with that

201
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:56.269
, then they have this nostri that, that sticks

202
00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:00.668
throughout their lives. So your experiences ear early in

203
00:11:00.678 --> 00:11:03.788
your, in your childhood in your young youth period

204
00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:05.029
are very important for, for how you think about

205
00:11:05.038 --> 00:11:09.109
regimes later on in your life. So there's definitely

206
00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:13.599
a close relationship here. So if in your early

207
00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:18.379
years you live in an autocracy, you can still

208
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:22.739
long for uh going back to it even though it

209
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.048
might have had certain issues. Yeah. So,

210
00:11:26.058 --> 00:11:28.538
I mean, so the authors here, they have

211
00:11:28.548 --> 00:11:31.000
tested this in Tunisia, for example. Uh Tunisia

212
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:33.519
is an interesting case because it was for long uh

213
00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:37.139
an autocracy, right? And then after the Arab

214
00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:39.580
Arab Spring, uh it became a democracy. Uh

215
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.190
But despite this, despite the freedoms that people certainly

216
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.859
got a large proportion of citizens actually long back to

217
00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:50.908
the life they had uh back in the good old

218
00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:52.629
autocratic days, not all, but that's a significant

219
00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:56.649
part who thought this way. Uh So, so

220
00:11:56.658 --> 00:11:58.250
, yeah, despite the fact that democracy brings something

221
00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:03.840
, uh uh some people have this autocratic nostalgia um

222
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:07.500
that we should be aware of. Mhm And with

223
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:11.259
that in mind. Uh Of course, people are

224
00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:13.830
worried about this or sometimes worry about this. I

225
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.879
, if uh people, citizens in western democracies really

226
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:24.330
do support democracy, do we know if they do

227
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.279
? What do we know about that? Yeah.

228
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:28.840
So, I mean, that's, that's a good

229
00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:31.399
question. That's also what I research on these days

230
00:12:31.408 --> 00:12:33.808
. So we, if you ask people directly,

231
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.340
do you support democracy? Uh Almost all say yes

232
00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:41.820
. Uh So almost all say yes, I support

233
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.168
democracy very much. Um And I think they actually

234
00:12:46.178 --> 00:12:48.129
mean it, I think it's in, especially in

235
00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:50.239
western democracies, it's in people's core values to support

236
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.200
democracy. Uh So people in western democracies at least

237
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.788
want to live in a democracy, they want freedom

238
00:12:56.798 --> 00:13:00.418
, they want all the things that come with living

239
00:13:00.428 --> 00:13:01.840
in a democracy. So people mean it when they

240
00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:05.330
say yes, I support democracy, but you also

241
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.690
have to separate support for democracy from satisfaction with democracy

242
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.950
. Often these things get conflated because you can easily

243
00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:16.739
on the one hand support democracy and think this is

244
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.869
the only way, only good way to go on

245
00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:22.178
a society. And on the other hand, be

246
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.668
very dissatisfied with how it actually works in your country

247
00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:28.779
. Um So you can support democracy and be dissatisfied

248
00:13:28.788 --> 00:13:31.009
with how it works in your country. You can

249
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.489
easily have both intimates. We need to be careful

250
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.058
not to conflate these two sentiments. Uh You can

251
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:41.038
have one and also have the other. Uh but

252
00:13:41.048 --> 00:13:43.678
if you talk about support for democracy, then yes

253
00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:46.570
, during the last 50 years, if you ask

254
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.158
people year after year, it's very, very stable

255
00:13:48.168 --> 00:13:50.609
, very, very high. Most people in western

256
00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:56.330
societies support democracy. We demand a lot from democracy

257
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:56.989
. We are becoming more and more critical. Uh

258
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.070
We hold it to higher, higher esteem. So

259
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.548
we want more and more from it and therefore many

260
00:14:03.558 --> 00:14:05.500
get dissatisfied, but we support democracy. That's very

261
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:09.000
clear. We want to live in democracy, at

262
00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.158
least in, in western societies. But about the

263
00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:16.479
second point, you mentioned there about people being satisfied

264
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:20.609
or not with democracy. Do we know anything about

265
00:14:20.619 --> 00:14:22.808
that? I mean, because even though people uh

266
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.269
say that they support democracy, do we know if

267
00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:30.519
they are really satisfied with living in a democratic regime

268
00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:33.418
or at least with certain practices that they see occurring

269
00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:35.960
in democracy? Yes. So that's the thing.

270
00:14:35.969 --> 00:14:41.690
So uh many are, are dissatisfied with democracy but

271
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.029
it's actually fewer than we think. Uh If you

272
00:14:43.038 --> 00:14:46.149
look at the uh the data, at least for

273
00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:50.519
Europe for the last 50 years in most countries,

274
00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:54.099
satisfaction with democracy goes up actually. Uh But you

275
00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:56.000
don't hear much about this because the media like to

276
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.158
portray the negative stories. That's the one that's the

277
00:15:00.168 --> 00:15:01.168
one people want to read about and hear about.

278
00:15:01.178 --> 00:15:05.359
But it is actually a positive story that satisfaction with

279
00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:07.820
democracy. Although low in some countries is going up

280
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.349
in most places, we are getting more satisfied uh

281
00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:15.570
Despite what we hear in mainstream media. So,

282
00:15:15.859 --> 00:15:18.428
so I think that's always important to say that yes

283
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.200
, democracy has its problems. We need to keep

284
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.250
improving it. We need to take care of those

285
00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:26.269
who are not satisfied with democracy. But it is

286
00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:28.029
a fact that more and more people in most European

287
00:15:28.038 --> 00:15:31.389
democracies at least are getting more satisfied with democracy.

288
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.259
It might be a different story in other places like

289
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:37.700
in us and, and in in more developing democracies

290
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.940
, but at least in Europe uh in most countries

291
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.279
, people are getting more satisfied, not less with

292
00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:46.599
the democracies. And I think that's important also to

293
00:15:46.609 --> 00:15:50.678
mention. So that, that's really interesting because many

294
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:56.759
people worry uh about the rise of certain extreme right

295
00:15:56.769 --> 00:16:02.288
wing parties in certain European countries. And sometimes people

296
00:16:02.298 --> 00:16:06.570
point to things like uh the 2008 economic crisis and

297
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.009
more recently, inflation and also the COVID pandemic and

298
00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:12.609
all of that. And uh they say or suggest

299
00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:17.359
that people uh are not, are no longer that

300
00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:21.043
satisfied with democracy. But according to what you're saying

301
00:16:21.053 --> 00:16:25.303
, across most, at least European countries, even

302
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:27.024
with all of that over time, people are saying

303
00:16:27.033 --> 00:16:32.594
that they are more satisfied with democracy. Actually,

304
00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:36.625
we saw a quite sharp dip after the 2008 crisis

305
00:16:36.634 --> 00:16:37.965
. So that's important to mention. So in almost

306
00:16:37.974 --> 00:16:41.293
all countries, it went sharply down to 2008 and

307
00:16:41.303 --> 00:16:45.585
the following years. But now, given the recoveries

308
00:16:45.594 --> 00:16:48.205
in most countries is rising again. So this is

309
00:16:48.678 --> 00:16:52.259
so that's an important qualification to make that 2008 to

310
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:56.849
2011 12 was a sharp decline in satisfaction with democracy

311
00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:00.509
across all, almost all countries. But we're getting

312
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:03.798
back to the level in most countries before the crisis

313
00:17:03.808 --> 00:17:07.150
and actually beyond that level. Uh But it's also

314
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.439
important to say, I'm not saying that there are

315
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:10.680
no problems with democracies, right? I mean,

316
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:14.289
uh we citizens, we we do act uh in

317
00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:17.809
inconsistent ways uh in many ways. So, so

318
00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:19.049
my point here is that the problem is not lack

319
00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:22.979
of support for democracy. The problem is not dissatisfaction

320
00:17:22.989 --> 00:17:26.140
with democracy. The problem is that we as ordinary

321
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.309
citizens are quite inconsistent with our democratic values. So

322
00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.828
as I said, when we are asked directly to

323
00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:37.299
support democracy, then we say yes, but when

324
00:17:37.309 --> 00:17:38.209
we then have to act on this, then we

325
00:17:38.219 --> 00:17:41.949
are quite inconsistent. Um uh The scholars who started

326
00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:44.769
this in a very nice way. Uh The two

327
00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:47.519
scholars from Yale, uh Matt Graham and Milan Soli

328
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:52.039
who, who in a quite forceful uh high contribution

329
00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:55.479
article showed that people are very inconsistent in terms of

330
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:57.219
the democratic values. Um And what you should try

331
00:17:57.229 --> 00:18:02.279
to imagine here is uh try imagine that your politician

332
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:06.618
or your party uh is acting undemocratically. So you

333
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.078
have your party, your politician, he or she

334
00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.809
gives you all the policies, you want, you

335
00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:12.509
get taxes, you want, you get the social

336
00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:15.459
spending, you want, you get the immigration policy

337
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:15.969
, you want, you get the health care,

338
00:18:15.979 --> 00:18:18.608
you want, you get the climate policy, you

339
00:18:18.618 --> 00:18:22.029
want, you get everything you want politically. However

340
00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:26.068
, this party of yours is acting undemocratically, he's

341
00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:29.989
violating core democratic rules and norms. Would you then

342
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.578
in this situation, vote for the opposition, would

343
00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:36.390
you reject your party and vote for the opposition?

344
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.019
You should, if you are a Democrat, right

345
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:40.519
? Like small d Democrat, if you, if

346
00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:41.519
you really believe in democracy, you should punish your

347
00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:45.479
party despite all the politics you get and vote for

348
00:18:45.489 --> 00:18:48.338
the opposition. But the thing is very few will

349
00:18:48.348 --> 00:18:52.088
do this. When push comes to show we are

350
00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:55.150
not willing, at least most are not willing to

351
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.390
punish our parties because we are partisans first and Democrats

352
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.420
only second. So when politics conflict with democracy,

353
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.660
then politics win. And this is a problem in

354
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.489
our society is that we do support democracy, we

355
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.140
do, we are pretty satisfied with it. But

356
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.439
when it clashes with other values like political values,

357
00:19:14.449 --> 00:19:17.059
then politics wins. And this is the problem uh

358
00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:19.670
in many Western democracies that when push comes to show

359
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:23.380
we are not willing to act consistently on our democratic

360
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.868
values. We are likely to, to put all

361
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.160
our values above democracy, for example, getting the

362
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.709
politics we want. And this is one of the

363
00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:36.019
reasons why undemocratic politicians can get away with it because

364
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.009
their voters don't punish them because politics is more important

365
00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:41.519
for most. So, that's one of the main

366
00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:48.640
reasons why sometimes people support undemocratic behavior. Yeah,

367
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.910
definitely. So, uh, if Trump does something

368
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.108
, uh, well then, uh, Trump voters

369
00:19:55.118 --> 00:19:56.598
, they, they will just accept it because,

370
00:19:56.608 --> 00:19:59.469
uh, they, they will never vote for the

371
00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:00.868
Democrats. Politics is more important for them than,

372
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.608
than, uh, getting the democracy. Right.

373
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.469
Uh, and this goes for both sides. It's

374
00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:07.410
not just a right wing thing. Uh It's both

375
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.430
on the left and the right. We are willing

376
00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:15.150
to uh accept undemocratic behavior from our politicians as long

377
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.170
as we get the policies we want because that's more

378
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.848
important for us. Um And that's one of the

379
00:20:18.858 --> 00:20:23.118
main challenges in in western democracies. Um And then

380
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.779
people can ask, so how can people live with

381
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:29.219
themselves? How can they cope with this situation?

382
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:32.910
Right? Uh And people have many coping mechanisms to

383
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.949
, to accept that they do what they do.

384
00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:38.469
Um And a lot of research have examined how people

385
00:20:38.479 --> 00:20:41.420
actually deal with this tense situation. It must be

386
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.118
to accept an undemocratic politician. Uh If I should

387
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:51.709
just mention 41 reason would be simply the people acknowledge

388
00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:53.910
, yes, I'm supporting an undemocratic candidate, but

389
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.838
this candidate or this party gives me the policies I

390
00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:59.640
want. So you just do it with open eyes

391
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.049
, you just accept that politics is more important for

392
00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:03.670
you than democracy. That's one way to, to

393
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.709
cope with this just to do it with, with

394
00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:11.410
eyes wide open a second opportunity. A possibility is

395
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.410
to rationalize what you mean by democracy and non democracy

396
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.348
. So this is what I do in my research

397
00:21:17.358 --> 00:21:18.939
. So what I find is that when people are

398
00:21:18.949 --> 00:21:22.309
confronted with undemocratic behavior from their side, so again

399
00:21:22.318 --> 00:21:26.699
, imagine your party or your politician acting undemocratically,

400
00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:30.160
then most people will actually just argue that this is

401
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.049
not undemocratic. They rationalize, they tell themselves that

402
00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:37.900
this behavior that objectively might be undemocratic. They convince

403
00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.818
themselves that this is not undemocratic. It, it

404
00:21:38.828 --> 00:21:42.568
follows all democratic rules and norms. So they are

405
00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:47.019
not uh selling democracy to get policy. They're actually

406
00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:49.949
getting both democracy and politics because it's not undemocratic.

407
00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:53.680
So they keep simply rationalized and tell themselves that a

408
00:21:53.900 --> 00:22:00.130
certain undemocratic behavior is perfectly democratic. A third way

409
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.608
is to accept that yes, I am supporting uh

410
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.650
an undemocratic candidate, but I'm not voting for the

411
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.130
opposition because they will be even worse. Uh If

412
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.239
I vote for the opposition, then they would violate

413
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.549
democracy even more and then democracy is doomed. So

414
00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:21.559
I support my candidate despite his or her flaws because

415
00:22:21.568 --> 00:22:22.989
the other side would be even more undemocratic. It

416
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.039
would be even worse for democracy. So I'm kind

417
00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:29.640
of saving democracy by sticking to my candidate. That's

418
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.699
the third way people cope with this by telling themselves

419
00:22:32.709 --> 00:22:36.578
that the other side is worse. 1/4 and final

420
00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.680
way they can cope with. This is by uh

421
00:22:38.689 --> 00:22:41.910
telling themselves that democracy is very strong. I mean

422
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.009
, at least in western democracies, people don't think

423
00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:48.239
many don't think that their democracies can break down.

424
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.939
I mean, they've been used to living in democracy

425
00:22:48.949 --> 00:22:52.719
for their whole lives so they don't know how fragile

426
00:22:52.729 --> 00:22:56.130
democracy is in reality. Uh So by telling yourself

427
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.578
that democracy is strong, uh you can easily accept

428
00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:00.979
supporting one or two undemocratic candidates, right? It

429
00:23:00.989 --> 00:23:04.130
doesn't matter. Uh democracy will, will stay despite

430
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.449
the fact that you vote for this undemocratic candidate.

431
00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:10.029
Uh So that's like the fourth way to cope with

432
00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:12.420
this situation is by telling yourself that democracy can with

433
00:23:12.939 --> 00:23:17.729
uh withstand these candidates without any problems. Democracy is

434
00:23:17.739 --> 00:23:22.338
strong voting once or twice for this candidate does not

435
00:23:22.348 --> 00:23:25.160
make a difference. So, so there are many

436
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.219
coping mechanisms, these are just four of them,

437
00:23:26.229 --> 00:23:30.858
but uh they show how people can uh live with

438
00:23:30.868 --> 00:23:33.219
themselves despite the fact that they vote for un democratic

439
00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:37.309
candidates from time to time. So people are good

440
00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:44.529
at rationalizing their inconsistent positions to democracy. Yeah,

441
00:23:44.539 --> 00:23:45.390
there are many ways to, to do so.

442
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.509
Yeah. So uh it's one thing for people to

443
00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:55.019
support democracy and be satisfied or not with it to

444
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:59.338
different degrees. But uh one thing that uh some

445
00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:03.390
people also suggest is for us to try to intervene

446
00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:07.618
and improve citizens democratic values. I mean, is

447
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.009
it possible to do that? At least from a

448
00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:15.549
scientific perspective. Are there any evidence-based interventions out there

449
00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:18.650
? Uh There are few, but we don't know

450
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.279
much about this right now. So we are slowly

451
00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:25.400
getting the diagnosis. Right. Right. So we

452
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.549
are slowly understanding what the problem is. Uh But

453
00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:30.459
we are very, it's very early days for the

454
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.799
intervention research. Uh It's right now, people are

455
00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:36.709
trying to work on this, trying to find out

456
00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:37.078
. So what can we do about it? How

457
00:24:37.088 --> 00:24:40.959
can we make people not vote for democratic candidates?

458
00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:44.078
How can we make people stick to the democratic core

459
00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:47.368
values? Um uh So we don't know much about

460
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.739
it right now. Uh We know a bit and

461
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.420
I can explain that to you. So one thing

462
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.229
we can do at least on the long term,

463
00:24:53.239 --> 00:24:56.479
uh it's education, right? So back to the

464
00:24:56.489 --> 00:25:00.920
and Neo and Finkel and those uh those guys in

465
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.338
that team, they show that civic education, democracy

466
00:25:03.348 --> 00:25:07.489
, education actually works. Uh You can educate people

467
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.989
in understanding democracy, valuing democracy uh preferably at an

468
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.430
early age in their lives. And that actually works

469
00:25:14.439 --> 00:25:17.180
in terms of getting people to become more democratic later

470
00:25:17.189 --> 00:25:18.900
in life. Uh This is like the long term

471
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:22.328
intervention, right? Uh We can also do something

472
00:25:22.338 --> 00:25:25.689
on the short term now and here. Uh But

473
00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:26.809
this is where we really don't know much. Uh

474
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.779
For example, there's this quite impressive mega study done

475
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:34.910
by a team from Stanford University. Uh uh Wil

476
00:25:36.098 --> 00:25:38.348
Robb Willer and colleagues, what they did is that

477
00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:41.640
they acknowledged that we don't know anything about this.

478
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:47.608
So they invited scholars, ordinary citizens practitioners to submit

479
00:25:47.618 --> 00:25:49.930
intervention suggestions to them. Uh They got more than

480
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:55.979
400 then they chose the 25 best or most promising

481
00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.880
interventions and tried to test them in the real world

482
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.189
or test them in, in a big online sample

483
00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:04.150
of uh representative sample of Americans to see which of

484
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:11.199
these 25 interventions worked. Unfortunately. Uh So almost

485
00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:14.170
all of these interventions worked in all the outcomes.

486
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.160
They worked in terms of reducing polarization, for example

487
00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:19.769
. So that's great but almost non worked in terms

488
00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:23.299
of improving democratic norms, almost non worked in terms

489
00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:27.509
of making people stick to democracy uh and reject on

490
00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:30.459
democratic behavior. Uh So that's a sad story,

491
00:26:30.469 --> 00:26:32.848
a sad part of it. And it shows that

492
00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:34.519
we know very little about this. Um There were

493
00:26:34.529 --> 00:26:38.699
two interventions that worked. Uh one that worked was

494
00:26:38.709 --> 00:26:42.828
by telling people or by like correcting the misbelief about

495
00:26:42.838 --> 00:26:45.890
the other side. So telling them that the other

496
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.939
side is not worse. So as I told before

497
00:26:47.949 --> 00:26:48.729
, this is one of the coping mechanisms, we

498
00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:52.279
support undemocratic behavior because we think the other side is

499
00:26:52.289 --> 00:26:56.318
worse and therefore we stick to our candidate. But

500
00:26:56.328 --> 00:26:56.640
this is not the case. I mean, the

501
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.959
other side is not worse. Uh This, these

502
00:26:59.969 --> 00:27:02.199
are the facts that show this. So uh our

503
00:27:02.209 --> 00:27:03.769
political opponents are not more undemocratic than we are.

504
00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:07.519
They are as democratic and like democracy as much as

505
00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:08.920
we do. And if people are being told this

506
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:11.578
, if people are being told that the other side

507
00:27:11.588 --> 00:27:12.799
is not worse, they love democracy as much as

508
00:27:12.809 --> 00:27:17.519
you do, then you yourself become less willing to

509
00:27:17.529 --> 00:27:19.180
support undemocratic behavior. Um And that actually works.

510
00:27:19.189 --> 00:27:22.799
So that's an intervention that works to, to tell

511
00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:26.118
people that uh we all appreciate to live in democracy

512
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:27.979
and therefore we should stick to it. So by

513
00:27:27.989 --> 00:27:30.250
telling that the other side is not worse, you

514
00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:34.650
yourself become less uh undemocratic in a sense. Another

515
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.150
intervention that worked uh uh is related to the the

516
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.289
last force coping mechanism, namely this idea that democracy

517
00:27:42.299 --> 00:27:45.910
is strong and and not fragile because what they did

518
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.640
here is that they showed a, a bunch of

519
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.750
videos to respond. Uh a bunch of videos showing

520
00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:56.130
democracies in trouble. So democracy being attacked by coups

521
00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.019
, uh January 6th footage uh stuff like that.

522
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:02.650
So showing a lot of videos of democracies in troubles

523
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.838
. Uh and what this had an effect was that

524
00:28:04.848 --> 00:28:10.750
it showed that democracies are not immune to these kind

525
00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:12.130
of troubles, it could happen in your country.

526
00:28:12.618 --> 00:28:15.318
And after watching these videos, the treatment group were

527
00:28:15.328 --> 00:28:18.750
less willing to support violations of democracy compared to the

528
00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:22.368
control group. So it also worked in terms of

529
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.000
improving our democratic norms. So these are like the

530
00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:29.309
two interventions so far we know works but apart from

531
00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:30.410
this, we know very little about how we can

532
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.160
make people stick to the democratic values. So we

533
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.750
need to do more research and maybe in one or

534
00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:40.170
two years, uh I can tell you more about

535
00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.209
this. Yeah. Uh But do you have any

536
00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:48.500
idea about exactly what kind of research we would need

537
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:52.828
specifically and what kind of knowledge we, we would

538
00:28:52.838 --> 00:28:57.469
need to have when it comes to developing more and

539
00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:03.670
better science based interventions to improving uh citizens, democratic

540
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.299
values. Yeah. So I personally, I think

541
00:29:07.309 --> 00:29:11.170
we should focus on the coping mechanisms, right?

542
00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.380
So we need to take them one at a time

543
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.348
and say, OK, how do people cope with

544
00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:18.949
the fact that they support on democratic candidates? And

545
00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:22.239
then we should try to block these coping mechanisms,

546
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.818
right? So those two that worked, worked in

547
00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:27.459
terms of one of these four coping mechanisms I showed

548
00:29:27.469 --> 00:29:30.890
you. So that would be my suggestion to start

549
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.489
with how do people overcome this dilemma and then try

550
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.489
to block that ability to overcome that dilemma. So

551
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.920
they have to reject our democratic behavior because we want

552
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.328
people to act democratically, right? Uh I think

553
00:29:44.338 --> 00:29:47.969
that's one way another way is also to acknowledge that

554
00:29:47.979 --> 00:29:49.289
this is not a fringe phenomenon. We have this

555
00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:52.608
idea that those citizens who do this are on the

556
00:29:52.618 --> 00:29:56.338
flanks. Like I say, extreme citizens on the

557
00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:57.689
right wing or extreme left. These are the people

558
00:29:57.699 --> 00:30:00.578
we need to educate, right? But research showed

559
00:30:00.588 --> 00:30:02.828
that this is you and me, I mean,

560
00:30:02.838 --> 00:30:04.900
ordinary citizens, uh we all do this from time

561
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.469
to time. We all have these biases inherent in

562
00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:10.559
us. So we shouldn't think that this is something

563
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.900
other people do. We do it ourselves. We

564
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.699
need to acknowledge that this is a mass phenomenon we

565
00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:18.640
like if not all, then most of us are

566
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.500
inconsistent when push comes to show and we need to

567
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:26.049
acknowledge this. So intervention should be aimed at the

568
00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:29.858
broad population, not just those on the fringes,

569
00:30:29.868 --> 00:30:33.068
you could easily think that. And then yeah,

570
00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:37.989
we need uh clear control treatment trials. Uh So

571
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.299
what people do right now is online surveys. I

572
00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:42.029
think we should, we need more of that.

573
00:30:42.039 --> 00:30:44.598
So we have a control group and then we have

574
00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:47.568
a treatment group who undergo one kind of treatment.

575
00:30:47.578 --> 00:30:48.368
So it could be watching a video or, or

576
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.269
reading some kind of information or, or doing something

577
00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:55.818
else and then to see the effects compared to the

578
00:30:55.828 --> 00:30:56.848
control group. So we need more of that kind

579
00:30:56.858 --> 00:31:00.519
of studies in order to be smart on this very

580
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:03.618
important topic. So uh uh when it comes to

581
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.618
people satisfaction, satisfaction with democracy, I would like

582
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.719
to ask you one specific question. So uh do

583
00:31:11.729 --> 00:31:17.410
we know if national elections are unequivocally good for that

584
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.699
? For people's satisfaction with democracy? That's a good

585
00:31:21.709 --> 00:31:26.368
question because uh uh one solution many people suggest is

586
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.750
to make citizens participate more on democracy. There's this

587
00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:33.189
idea that the more participation, the better. Uh

588
00:31:33.199 --> 00:31:36.209
but I'm not sure this is the right way to

589
00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:38.430
go and you see this with national elections because it

590
00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:41.759
, it all depends on the experiences you have when

591
00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:45.989
you participate in the democratic process, if you have

592
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.549
good experiences, then that sentiment sticks in the years

593
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:52.098
to come and you become more satisfied with democracy.

594
00:31:52.219 --> 00:31:55.279
If you had bad experiences, last time you participated

595
00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:59.029
in the democratic process, then that bad sentiment sticks

596
00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:01.750
and you get more dissatisfied with democracy and you see

597
00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:05.519
this with the elections. So if your last election

598
00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:08.559
took place during uh uh economic growth period, then

599
00:32:08.568 --> 00:32:10.920
you are more satisfied with democracy in the years to

600
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.029
come regardless of how the economy performs afterwards. On

601
00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:17.400
the other hand, last time you went to the

602
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.430
polls, if there was a period of economic crisis

603
00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.900
and you had a bad experience that day, you

604
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.519
, you had bad sentiment when you participate in democracy

605
00:32:25.529 --> 00:32:28.890
, then that bad feeling sticks in the years to

606
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.838
come again, regardless of how the economy performs.

607
00:32:31.529 --> 00:32:34.719
So it all depends, it depends on whether you

608
00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:37.199
had good or bad experiences. Last time you participated

609
00:32:37.209 --> 00:32:40.180
in the democratic process and that sentiment is likely to

610
00:32:40.189 --> 00:32:44.088
stick until next time you, you go vote for

611
00:32:44.098 --> 00:32:46.059
example. So, so it all depends. Uh

612
00:32:46.449 --> 00:32:52.549
you mentioned economic crisis there and earlier in our conversation

613
00:32:52.858 --> 00:32:55.049
, uh I brought to the table the 2008 economic

614
00:32:55.059 --> 00:33:00.000
crisis very briefly. So why is it that sometimes

615
00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:06.799
economic crisis lead to democratic breakdown and sometimes they don't

616
00:33:07.939 --> 00:33:09.469
. Yeah. So economic crisis is probably one of

617
00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:15.598
the most destabilizing events we know of uh in terms

618
00:33:15.608 --> 00:33:17.519
of regime stability. Uh and one of the reasons

619
00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:22.049
is at least in, in, in many places

620
00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:24.650
around the world, people want basic necessities, right

621
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.630
? I mean, they want to have a job

622
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.959
, they want to be able to provide for the

623
00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:34.739
families, they want to uh have a decent living

624
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.818
basically. And during an economic crisis, these things

625
00:33:37.828 --> 00:33:39.519
are, are threatened, you might lose your job

626
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:43.029
, you might not be able to put food on

627
00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:45.219
the table to provide for your family. And when

628
00:33:45.229 --> 00:33:46.969
that happened, you turn your anger towards the regime

629
00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:50.338
and it goes both ways, both for autocracies and

630
00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:52.848
democracies. Uh you get dissatisfied and maybe you even

631
00:33:53.809 --> 00:33:55.880
will challenge the regime. Maybe you go to the

632
00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.309
street in a protest or at least you don't do

633
00:33:59.318 --> 00:34:00.689
anything if others try to topple the regime. So

634
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:06.640
economic crisis are perhaps the most destabilizing events because it

635
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.250
makes people very angry and very dissatisfied with whatever regime

636
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.427
they have. Mhm. And what other factors apart

637
00:34:14.438 --> 00:34:20.860
from economic crisis? Explain democratic breakdown. Yes,

638
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:24.070
I mean, uh age I think is uh perhaps

639
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:29.148
one of the strongest expenditure factors. So the older

640
00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.469
the democracy, the more stable it is the younger

641
00:34:31.478 --> 00:34:35.349
the democracy, the more unstable and more likely to

642
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.789
break down. It is uh so regime stability take

643
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.148
many years to, to kind of build up.

644
00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.869
Um uh a good example is uh the interwar period

645
00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:49.590
. So the period between the 1st and 2nd World

646
00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.829
War, uh so at the end of the first

647
00:34:51.838 --> 00:34:55.208
world war, almost all countries in Europe were democracies

648
00:34:55.918 --> 00:34:59.458
. When the second world war started, half of

649
00:34:59.467 --> 00:35:00.967
the continent's democracies broke down. So it's a very

650
00:35:00.978 --> 00:35:05.717
, very neat laboratory to understand why some democracies broke

651
00:35:05.728 --> 00:35:07.717
down while others didn't. And what we see here

652
00:35:07.728 --> 00:35:12.478
is that all those countries, all those democracies that

653
00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:15.548
were democracy prior to First World War. So we

654
00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:19.989
could call them relatively old democracies. They all survived

655
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.228
without exception, all those who broke down were new

656
00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:28.269
democracies. So countries that only became democracy after first

657
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.300
World war, Germany, uh Italy, Spain uh

658
00:35:31.309 --> 00:35:35.478
countries like that. Um um Not to say that

659
00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:37.449
all young democracies broke down. We had some young

660
00:35:37.458 --> 00:35:40.519
democracies who survived uh Finland, for example. Uh

661
00:35:40.869 --> 00:35:44.280
But it is a very, very strong relationship.

662
00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:46.958
Um So the age of democracy or autocracy is very

663
00:35:46.969 --> 00:35:50.688
important, the older you are, the more stable

664
00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:52.050
you are basically. Um So that's uh that's important

665
00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:54.590
to know. Uh Then of course, economic crisis

666
00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:58.708
as we talked about. Uh but having a stable

667
00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:00.000
party system and strong civil society is also a good

668
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.949
thing if you want a stable democracy. Um And

669
00:36:04.958 --> 00:36:07.619
then I think it's also important to mention external influence

670
00:36:07.628 --> 00:36:10.958
. So uh if you are in a democratic neighborhood

671
00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:14.820
, if you have a good democratic superpower next to

672
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:16.320
you, that also makes your country more democratic.

673
00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:17.599
Uh On the other hand, if you have like

674
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:22.070
an autocratic superpower next door, like like China or

675
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.418
Russia, then it's much harder for you all to

676
00:36:24.429 --> 00:36:27.539
say, sustain your democracy because then you have this

677
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:32.099
autocratic influence coming every day constantly from this autocratic superpower

678
00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:36.780
. So geography and international factors also matters a lot

679
00:36:36.789 --> 00:36:42.199
in terms of your survival chances. So just a

680
00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:44.860
second ago, when I asked you about the effects

681
00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.478
of economic crisis, you also mentioned there that even

682
00:36:47.489 --> 00:36:52.340
in autocracies, they can sometimes lead to regime instability

683
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:58.500
. So, but what happens specifically when autocratic leaders

684
00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.708
are exposed to economic crisis or how do they deal

685
00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:05.639
with it? Yes, in many ways, it's

686
00:37:05.648 --> 00:37:07.750
kind of the same scenario, right? I mean

687
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:10.398
, uh if an autocracy is experiencing crisis, they

688
00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:15.159
also face dissatisfaction from their citizens because they want the

689
00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:17.378
same thing. Uh People still want bread on the

690
00:37:17.389 --> 00:37:21.179
table to provide for the families a decent job.

691
00:37:21.188 --> 00:37:24.438
Uh So they also get the same challenges. Uh

692
00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:29.128
Often it is in different ways because autopsies are better

693
00:37:29.139 --> 00:37:32.110
at uh uh suppressing, at least tough autopsies are

694
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:36.110
better at suppressing the center from below. Uh uh

695
00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:37.449
But perhaps they are more vulnerable to other types of

696
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:40.510
breakdowns like coups, for example. So historically,

697
00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:43.949
coups has been the number one way to, to

698
00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:46.309
topple many, many regimes around the world. Uh

699
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:50.688
So the leaders removed from by the military or all

700
00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:52.590
those within the state. So the point is they

701
00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:55.519
are also vulnerable during times of economic crisis, but

702
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.039
they can also shield themselves. I mean, democracies

703
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.800
don't break down every time there's a crisis and likewise

704
00:38:00.809 --> 00:38:04.010
, autocracies don't break down every time there's a crisis

705
00:38:04.019 --> 00:38:06.489
, they can shield themselves. For example, if

706
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.280
they have natural resources, uh oil, uh diamonds

707
00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:13.219
, stuff like that, then they ensure this constant

708
00:38:13.228 --> 00:38:15.179
flow of money despite being in an economic crisis.

709
00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:17.188
And if they have this constant flow of money,

710
00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.039
then they can still pay off the core supporters of

711
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.349
the regime and stay stable despite the crisis. So

712
00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:27.978
some autocracies are very stable despite the fact that they

713
00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:30.739
might have a crisis, especially if they have other

714
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.769
sources of income, natural resource being one of the

715
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.070
most important ones. Mhm. So, I mean

716
00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:38.978
, when it comes to shielding themselves from, for

717
00:38:38.989 --> 00:38:45.070
example, revolutions, coups and assassination attempts, it's

718
00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:50.199
um uh many times a matter of having enough resources

719
00:38:50.208 --> 00:38:52.500
to do it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

720
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:58.128
And preferably resources that are unrelated to the broad society

721
00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:00.309
. So no matter whether you're having a crisis or

722
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.329
not, you'll get your oil income, right?

723
00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.648
I mean, uh oil country still need to buy

724
00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:07.360
the oil. So it's relatively unrelated to an economic

725
00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:09.958
crisis where you get your oil income or not.

726
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:14.110
Uh So having this source of income that is unrelated

727
00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:17.409
to the broader societal economy, that's preferable as an

728
00:39:17.418 --> 00:39:21.159
autocrat because then you ensure a stable inflow of money

729
00:39:21.168 --> 00:39:23.489
that you can use to pay off your key supporters

730
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.030
uh during this tough time. So that's a very

731
00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:30.128
important shield. OK. So Doctor Krishna Rayan,

732
00:39:30.139 --> 00:39:34.239
uh just before we go, uh I, I

733
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.168
mean, e even before I ask you, where

734
00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:37.000
can people find you on the internet? Would you

735
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.849
like to tell us what are you working on at

736
00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.429
the moment and what work you will be doing in

737
00:39:45.438 --> 00:39:49.110
the near future? Yes, I'm actually working on

738
00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:51.929
this intervention aspect. As I said, we don't

739
00:39:51.938 --> 00:39:54.760
know much about what can we do about this situation

740
00:39:54.769 --> 00:39:58.128
, right? In democracies, especially in western democracies

741
00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:00.309
, the fact that people are very inconsistent, they

742
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.340
say they value democracy, but then they still support

743
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:07.648
undemocratic candidates and many does. So how can we

744
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.349
intervene and prevent this from happening? So this is

745
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.168
what I'm working on right now. Uh And this

746
00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:15.619
very early days also in my research, so I

747
00:40:15.628 --> 00:40:19.389
don't have any concrete results right now, perhaps in

748
00:40:19.398 --> 00:40:22.530
a year or two. But I'm also, I've

749
00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:23.849
also jumped into this question right now because I think

750
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.340
it's one of the most uh important and vital questions

751
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:30.409
to ask uh in democracies today, how can we

752
00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:34.458
help people? How can we empower people to resist

753
00:40:34.469 --> 00:40:37.139
undemocratic behavior? So this is what I do right

754
00:40:37.148 --> 00:40:39.840
now. OK. And where can people find your

755
00:40:39.849 --> 00:40:43.938
work on the internet. Uh I mean, I

756
00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:46.119
have my web page student dot DK. Uh So

757
00:40:46.128 --> 00:40:49.829
it's just my name dot DK so that uh uh

758
00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:52.719
that should be straightforward. I have all my papers

759
00:40:52.728 --> 00:40:55.139
articles in there. Um And then also at the

760
00:40:55.148 --> 00:40:59.199
conferences, uh I'm going to, to Glasgow for

761
00:40:59.208 --> 00:41:01.809
IP S A conference uh uh in June. Uh

762
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.228
So, yeah, there, I'm also available.

763
00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:08.418
