Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.920
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.810
today I'm joined by Doctor Gwendolyn Dals. She is

4
00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.529
Professor of Philosophy at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

5
00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.010
and host of the Goodies in the Details podcast.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.639
And today we're talking about existentialism, feminism, the philosophy

7
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.979
of Simone de Beauvoir and other related topics. So,

8
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.389
Doctor Toski, welcome to the show. It's a huge

9
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.319
pleasure to have you

10
00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.440
everyone. Thank you for having me.

11
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.080
So let me just start by asking you sort

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.389
of a more general question. So you're a philosopher

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.419
and people who are not philosophers themselves or might

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.029
not think that philosophy? Is that interesting of a

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.619
subject? What would you tell them when it comes

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.319
to the role that philosophy plays in your own

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.319
personal life? And it, and that it can also

18
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.720
play in people's lives more generally.

19
00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:07.469
Yeah, I think i it, it's a good question

20
00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:09.219
to start out. A lot of times when I

21
00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:13.738
say I study philosophy or I teach philosophy, there

22
00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.789
will be some random person who say, oh philosophy,

23
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.549
there's like no right answer and then I have

24
00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:22.679
to stop and say OK, let's examine that claim.

25
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.010
Let's do philosophy here. If there is no right

26
00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:32.099
answer, then you're presupposing a definition of right in

27
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.830
order for you to make that claim. So if

28
00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.000
there is no right answer, then that claim could

29
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.330
not possibly be right. So that's what philosophy does

30
00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:44.769
philosophy examines the ideas that underscore our view of

31
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.370
the world, our assumptions about the world. Philosophy is

32
00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.644
ultimately a wonderment. How does this work? How, how

33
00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:53.764
does that work? I also talk about it in

34
00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:56.514
terms of problem solving, but it's a unique type

35
00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.644
of problem solving. So for example, I have my

36
00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:02.525
phone here. If we were to say, does this

37
00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.565
phone exist? It would be a very short conversation.

38
00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:07.654
Um If we were in person, we could use

39
00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.125
the five senses, you can hear it, I guess,

40
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.225
smell it, see it all the five senses to

41
00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:15.615
establish that this is here. Now, if I want

42
00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:19.669
to ask the question, what is justice that requires

43
00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.589
a different set of thinking skills? We do not

44
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.119
have the five senses to come to a conclusion

45
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.389
because it doesn't occupy space. So I say philosophy

46
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:31.110
is problem solving for things that don't occupy space.

47
00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.059
Like what is justice? What is beauty? What is

48
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.190
goodness? Um What does it mean to be virtuous,

49
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.800
to be a good person? What is good character?

50
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.699
And so those are the types of things that

51
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.250
philosophy deals with. And when we have an understanding

52
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.250
of that like justice or rightness or wrongness that

53
00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.009
underscores the way we can address things in our

54
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.570
everyday lives, how we teach our Children, for instance,

55
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.289
you know, do not steal. I mean, why, why

56
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.904
not really like philosophy can answer the question of

57
00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:04.375
where do we get these ideas? But the same

58
00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.904
thing with our own judicial system in a court

59
00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:09.675
of law, it's important to be able to establish

60
00:03:09.684 --> 00:03:13.205
the distinction between rightness and wrongness before law can

61
00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.725
even be established.

62
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.500
So uh I'm a big fan of your podcast.

63
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.500
Goodies in the details. I've listened to a lot

64
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.279
of uh its episodes. I mean, not all of

65
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.220
them, of course, but lots of them. And uh

66
00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.009
I would like to ask you what goals did

67
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.720
you have in mind when you started your podcast?

68
00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.190
I mean, did you have specific goals in mind

69
00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.259
and why do you explore the kinds of topics

70
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.289
you explore there and try to expose them to

71
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.899
a more to a wider audience?

72
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.990
Yeah, I mean, it started out really as a

73
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.649
hunch. So in teaching philosophy, I have a lot

74
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.210
of students who come through for General General Ed,

75
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.410
meaning that the university requires them no matter what

76
00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.070
your major is to take a few subjects outside

77
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.160
of your major. The overwhelming majority of my students

78
00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.830
in my philosophy classes are in that camp where

79
00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:15.490
they're majoring in something like engineering or literature, but

80
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.459
they have to squeeze in an extra class. So

81
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.920
I would have these wonderful conversations with my students

82
00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:25.079
at the end of the semester long after the

83
00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:27.380
semester, I'd get these emails saying they saw this

84
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.369
movie that reminded me, that reminded them of something

85
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.790
from our class. Just there was a lot of

86
00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:36.119
joy in being introduced to the subject. And so

87
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.000
I had a hunch of why do we need

88
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.119
to gate keep gatekeep this behind the university walls.

89
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.399
This should be available for everyone. Now, it was

90
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.500
just a hunch to go ahead and tackle these

91
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.549
philosophical issues that we do on goodies in the

92
00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:52.760
details. But shortly in it caught on to a

93
00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:56.549
broad audience, which is what I wanted. But I

94
00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.269
didn't, I didn't really expect that. And so the

95
00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.510
success of the podcast has been very exciting where

96
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:07.350
we have academics from different areas. We have people

97
00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:11.959
from medicine to comedy and entertainment, come on and

98
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.339
we want to get to the ideas that underscore

99
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.140
their work and the purpose of the show. I

100
00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:20.299
think first of all, it's personal enjoyment. I can't,

101
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.670
I can't get around that if someone would be

102
00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:22.959
like, why do you do this? I'm like, because

103
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.359
it makes me happy. It's just an absolute delight

104
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.549
to be able to tap into some of the

105
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:33.029
best talent and have an hour of their time

106
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.549
to discuss their work. But the other thing that

107
00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:40.529
Rudy, my co-host Rudy Salo and I, we genuinely

108
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.579
believe that one of the pillars to happiness and

109
00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:47.230
to enjoying one's life is intellectual growth, that foundation

110
00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:49.899
of curiosity. And so a lot of times when

111
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.380
people talk about happiness and this is 100% correct.

112
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.750
We talk about the physical like move, take a

113
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.940
walk, we talk about the spiritual, which appeals to

114
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.709
a lot, a lot of people. Um WE talk

115
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.179
about emotional things and relationships. All of those are

116
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.859
part and parcel of a good life in addition

117
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:14.010
to curiosity and intellectual development. Another thing that we

118
00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:16.859
really want to have is our goal is that

119
00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.910
when somebody listens to the episode that they learn

120
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.359
something that they didn't know, they didn't know. And

121
00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:23.899
we always say that that's in the spirit of

122
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.500
Socrates. One of the greatest lessons I think that

123
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.410
we learn from Socrates is this idea that when

124
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.480
you dialogue with others, when you have this mission

125
00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:39.269
for self improvement, that it requires engagement with others

126
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.890
and not just a retreat from the world, but

127
00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:44.600
the more you learn, then the more humble you

128
00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:47.839
become not arrogant, arrogance comes from when you think

129
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.500
you know everything humility and curiosity and joy come

130
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.279
from learning more and then knowing that there's more

131
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.519
to learn. And so that's what Rudy and I

132
00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.119
are doing for ourselves. And we want the audience

133
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.070
to be on that journey with us.

134
00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:06.739
Great. So, I mean, the questions I'm going to

135
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.359
ask you are most of them. At least you

136
00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:14.200
explore in your podcast. And a, as a philosopher,

137
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:18.309
of course, there are an immense amount of topics

138
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.190
that you could be interested in. But uh I

139
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.100
noticed that you are particularly interested in existentialism and

140
00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:29.779
more specifically the philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir. So

141
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.760
what got you interested in existentialism? And then her

142
00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:36.730
specifically,

143
00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.880
I, I think I was in graduate school and

144
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.640
I was assigned something by the philosopher Kirkegaard. I

145
00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:47.230
think it was either or and after coming from

146
00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:53.839
a tradition of analytic philosophy, um I, I was

147
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.700
stunned when I was reading care, I was that

148
00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:01.519
I didn't know that this type of thinking existed.

149
00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:03.940
Now. One of the things that I've loved that

150
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.070
ever since I was a child is that I

151
00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.540
am a bookworm. I am constantly reading fiction. It

152
00:08:09.549 --> 00:08:12.269
is how I unwind the way people do. Netflix

153
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:14.570
Binges for instance, is what I'll do with like

154
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:18.760
mystery genres. Um I'm completely in love with them.

155
00:08:19.109 --> 00:08:23.179
So I had always separated that love for fiction

156
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.769
from my enjoyment of philosophy. I loved the analytic

157
00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.260
tradition of thinking about what is justice or how

158
00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:32.830
do you put together, um you know, arguments and

159
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.760
how do you dismantle arguments? It's a different type

160
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.679
of thinking. It's more of like a mathematical type

161
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.080
thinking. Whereas fiction was for my imagination and joy.

162
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.450
When I came across Kirkegaard, it was the first

163
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.320
time that I saw you could do both. Uh

164
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.549
I think my daughter is gonna come in the

165
00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.530
books that you could actually do both. And um

166
00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.679
what I was gonna say before I, before I

167
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.710
take off, um is that with Kirkegaard, the way

168
00:08:57.719 --> 00:09:01.210
in which he approached philosophy was, he saw the

169
00:09:01.219 --> 00:09:06.260
analytic tradition and he was saying, we still need

170
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.270
to know what it means to be human. That

171
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.000
philosophy is avoiding the most interesting question. He said,

172
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.030
subjectivity is the case in point. It doesn't mean

173
00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:20.390
that everything is subjective. It's that the most unique

174
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.109
and interesting thing about our existence is not discovering

175
00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:27.780
absolutes, but it's an understanding our unique position and

176
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:30.390
the way in which we experience the world. And

177
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.950
he used pseudonyms and a bit of fiction in

178
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.210
order to come across in order to make that

179
00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:38.650
point. And then I started to study that tradition

180
00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:40.130
and I fell in love with Simone de Boire.

181
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.049
So then what got me into Simone de Bois?

182
00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.270
I remember it specifically. Now people, some people might

183
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.840
not know this people outside of academia. But um

184
00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:54.479
philosophy is a male dominated field. I never even

185
00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.744
read any women philosophy. It wasn't until I was

186
00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:00.554
in my first year of my master's program that

187
00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:04.114
I asked a professor, what um are there any

188
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.674
female philosophers like I didn't even know that if

189
00:10:06.684 --> 00:10:10.034
they existed or not. And so he gave me

190
00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:12.765
a little book by um Hannah and that was

191
00:10:12.775 --> 00:10:15.434
my first introduction to being like, oh women philosophers

192
00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:18.830
do exist. Then fast forward about another year. It

193
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.510
was a summer holiday, a summer break and I

194
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.640
decided to sit down and read the work of

195
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.349
Simon de be before. I thought, who is this

196
00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.270
woman? So I did it on my own. Never

197
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.700
from a class or anything like that. And the

198
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.849
first thing I picked up was her fiction. All

199
00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:36.159
Men are Mortal. And I remember being at a

200
00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:40.520
cafe and getting that and I didn't, I didn't

201
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.520
move. I was just so stunned and so intrigued

202
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.320
by this novel that then I had to read

203
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.840
everything else by her. And I think that what

204
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.039
it wasn't just that she was a woman philosopher.

205
00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:55.200
It wasn't just that she was an existentialist. I

206
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.440
think the fact that she was also in literature

207
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.520
and writing fiction in order to be philosophical was

208
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.119
what really interested me.

209
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.969
Mhm. No, I, I have to tell you that

210
00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:10.609
I'm also very much into existentialism and Simone de

211
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.590
Beauvoir specifically is probably in the top three of

212
00:11:14.599 --> 00:11:17.940
my favorite philosophers. I mean, number one is diogenes,

213
00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.880
number two is Nietzsche. And then probably Simone de

214
00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:25.510
Beauvoir. I, I mean, Nietzsche, it, it's not because

215
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.505
he's a man, of course, because it doesn't matter

216
00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:30.265
to me at all if someone is a man

217
00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:33.544
or a woman philosopher. But uh I just like

218
00:11:33.554 --> 00:11:37.054
him a little bit better than the bavois perhaps

219
00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:42.244
because he was very influential for uh French existentialists.

220
00:11:42.255 --> 00:11:45.455
But a anyway, uh I, I th those are

221
00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:48.945
my preferences and the respect of bois very, very,

222
00:11:48.955 --> 00:11:52.859
very much. And, uh talking about that, well, you're

223
00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:57.630
also interested in feminism. Where would you place the,

224
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.900
the bois in the history of feminism? I mean,

225
00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:04.229
how important would you say she is in that

226
00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:08.570
history? And in what ways do you think feminism

227
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.000
would intersect with existentialism?

228
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.530
Yeah, I think she is, she's extremely, extremely important.

229
00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:20.940
Um, I would say one of the first works

230
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.580
of feminist writing in philosophy. Um It might go

231
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.510
back to a thinker by the name of Mary

232
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.010
Wilson Craft. And I always tell my students, I

233
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.570
say you may not have heard of Mary Wilson

234
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.900
Craft, but you've definitely heard of her daughter. So

235
00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:37.520
Mary Wilson Craft was writing in the late 17

236
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.340
hundreds. And it makes sense that in the West,

237
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:44.119
we, you had this upheaval of the American revolution,

238
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.500
the French revolution, there was this upheaval in the

239
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.780
west of we can govern ourselves. And Mary Wilson

240
00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:52.809
craft was very much situated in that time frame

241
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.609
and writing that women ought to have the right

242
00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:58.710
to education. And in order for her to even

243
00:12:58.719 --> 00:13:00.630
make the point that women should be able to

244
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.869
be educated, she had to backtrack about a lot

245
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.539
of assumptions about women based on the body into

246
00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:09.760
which they were born, namely this idea that for

247
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.010
a woman to be virtuous or good meant that

248
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.530
she was obedient. And Mary Wilson Craft was saying,

249
00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:18.859
but that's not what virtue is virtue, by definition

250
00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:23.520
is using reason to make ethical decisions. If you

251
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.409
deprive a woman of education, you're depriving her of

252
00:13:26.419 --> 00:13:29.599
reason. Therefore, you're depriving her of the possibility of

253
00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:33.210
being virtuous. So Mary Wilson craft really laid out

254
00:13:33.219 --> 00:13:37.520
this argument of the problems of presupposing what a

255
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.349
person is capable of based on the body in

256
00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:42.400
which they were born. And she did that using

257
00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:46.750
virtue theory. 200 years later, you have Simone de

258
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.859
Bois and Simon Bear is in that same vein.

259
00:13:51.869 --> 00:13:57.349
But she's really picking apart this idea of existentialism

260
00:13:57.359 --> 00:14:02.969
that in, in existentialism, she is rejecting the idea

261
00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:07.219
of order. She's rejecting the idea that there is

262
00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:13.169
human nature. She is um an advocate for freedom

263
00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.184
that we always have choice, but something that she

264
00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:19.315
was able to accomplish that her male counterparts, people

265
00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.744
like. So people like Kamu were not able to

266
00:14:21.755 --> 00:14:25.905
accomplish is that she really um drove home the

267
00:14:25.914 --> 00:14:30.715
importance of being in a body. And the history

268
00:14:30.724 --> 00:14:36.065
of philosophy with male thinkers have not had taken

269
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:40.179
for granted the the body. And it took somebody

270
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.369
who was kind of on the outside of the

271
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.650
tradition like Simone de Boire to be like, no,

272
00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:46.260
wait, I have to interact in a world. I

273
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.349
can't, I'm not just a mind, I'm not just

274
00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:51.539
a floating thought bubble that is being rational. I

275
00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:54.380
have to interact in a world that is hostile

276
00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:57.215
to me that is telling me what I can

277
00:14:57.224 --> 00:14:59.765
and cannot do that has created a bunch of

278
00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:03.484
rules for way I'm supposed to behave. So women

279
00:15:03.494 --> 00:15:07.565
would have this extra existential trek if you will,

280
00:15:07.604 --> 00:15:10.645
that they're not just thrown into existence, but they're

281
00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:14.284
thrown into a world that is not structured for

282
00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:16.364
them. And so in order for them to be

283
00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:20.609
successful, they have these extra hurdles that is extremely

284
00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:24.869
important. The Simone de Bobois prioritized the way in

285
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.619
which we are in a body. AND that is

286
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.679
how our freedom is engaged with that extra caveat.

287
00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:35.780
And the reason why bobois is so important is

288
00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:38.179
because you can even look at the trajectory of

289
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.760
feminist thought where it still has that same principle

290
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.719
of let's have um a conversation, an authentic conversation

291
00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:49.349
about what it is like to be born in

292
00:15:49.359 --> 00:15:53.320
a body and that that body is interacting or

293
00:15:53.330 --> 00:16:00.109
being commented on treated legally, socially, economically different. And

294
00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:02.400
that opened up the doors for a lot of

295
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:05.479
work, especially for women of color who have said,

296
00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:08.080
wait, the way that the world treats us is

297
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.570
different from, let's say a white woman. But we're

298
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.400
able to kind of have conversations and understand that

299
00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:17.880
reality, I think because Beauvoir was putting into the

300
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.900
ethos if you will, that it is relevant, that

301
00:16:21.909 --> 00:16:24.400
it is relevant. We can't just talk about, oh,

302
00:16:24.409 --> 00:16:26.650
you know, you are free to make decisions to

303
00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:28.799
do whatever you want. No, that we kind of

304
00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:31.530
find out who we are in situation and some

305
00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:36.159
situations are more complex or cause more of an

306
00:16:36.169 --> 00:16:40.159
obstacle than other situations. So as a woman, for

307
00:16:40.169 --> 00:16:43.840
instance, in my little girl, I have different um

308
00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:48.729
obstacles in the world than Amanda. And this um

309
00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:52.590
can be like just in terms of the way

310
00:16:52.599 --> 00:16:54.659
that I'm treated, let's say, historically, the way that

311
00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:59.789
women are treated economically in athletics, in medicine. And

312
00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:02.210
that's something to take into account when we're figuring

313
00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:04.489
out our existence. So I think Simone de bois

314
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.140
and feminism are, they're very, very relevant. They're very,

315
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.880
they're very important. And I love how Simone De

316
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.199
Boar puts existentialism as the lens for feminism where

317
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:21.560
she's still highlighting the importance of subjectivity and the

318
00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:25.510
way in which, um, the uniqueness of our existence.

319
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.140
And if, if, is it OK, if I give

320
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.329
an example, because there's a novella by far that

321
00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:33.229
I'm in love with and it's, that drives home

322
00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:36.310
this point to me. Now, this is a novella

323
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:40.290
called The Woman Destroyed. And when I first read

324
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.010
it, when I was in graduate school, it didn't

325
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.699
really resonate with me. Um, I loved all men

326
00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:47.770
are mortal. I loved the Mandarins. And then of

327
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.819
course, her philosophical pieces like the second sex and,

328
00:17:51.829 --> 00:17:56.329
um, the ethics of ambiguity. But later I reread

329
00:17:56.339 --> 00:17:59.579
The Woman Destroyed. And I thought, hm, it gave

330
00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:04.709
me pause. Now I'm 46 20 years away, over

331
00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:06.750
20 years from the first time I read it

332
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.609
and I read it over and over again, for

333
00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:10.800
one of the classes that I teach. And without

334
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.739
exception, every time I read it, I have to

335
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.520
sit down and be alone with myself because I

336
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.560
am just astonished at what she accomplished in this

337
00:18:19.569 --> 00:18:22.000
novella and why I didn't get it when I

338
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.839
was in my twenties. And at the time that

339
00:18:24.849 --> 00:18:28.689
Beauvoir published this, she was, she was older. And

340
00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:32.109
so she's writing um in a diary format, the

341
00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:37.709
trajectory of the demise of a woman who this

342
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:41.160
woman, Monique is writing a diary about how her

343
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.150
life is falling apart. Her kids are grown and

344
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.520
her husband is moving on with the mistress and

345
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.040
she doesn't know what to do. And so this

346
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:56.079
question of destroyed is so important because you have

347
00:18:56.089 --> 00:18:58.319
to ask yourself what is being destroyed? Is it

348
00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:02.030
the version of herself or is she destroyed? And

349
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.359
the reason why it always resonates with me now

350
00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:06.829
is because there's such a difference between being a

351
00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:08.920
feminist in your twenties to being a feminist in

352
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.160
your forties. When you're a feminist in your twenties,

353
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.640
you're rejecting this idea that you're only good for

354
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.319
X, that you're only good for reproduction. For instance,

355
00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:21.000
you're only good as a wife and a mother

356
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.780
in your forties. You're rejecting the idea that you're

357
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.989
not good at all because you're past the the

358
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.349
baby making point. So the feminist in her forties

359
00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:35.530
is has a different calling being like I still

360
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.810
matter. I still exist. Whereas in your twenties. You're

361
00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:41.969
like, I don't just exist for you in your

362
00:19:41.979 --> 00:19:45.089
forties, fifties, sixties, you're arguing that you still matter

363
00:19:45.349 --> 00:19:50.040
because everything is placed on that baby making era.

364
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.589
The goodness of women and the tragedy of the

365
00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:58.489
woman destroyed is that Monique bought into the idea

366
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.729
that that was her value and she's finding out

367
00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.319
that it's not and everybody's moving on. Her kids

368
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.969
are moving on. Her husband is moving on. And

369
00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:10.290
I think it's such an important lesson because it

370
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.810
is this idea of accepting that there is truth

371
00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.319
in our choices. But also trying to sit back

372
00:20:17.329 --> 00:20:19.859
and wonder what choice was mine. Am I just

373
00:20:19.869 --> 00:20:23.180
living according to what other people decided was of

374
00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:26.410
value for me. How do we find out what

375
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.250
is valuable? And then also we have that opportunity

376
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.900
to grow and change just because you thought something

377
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.930
was really cool in your twenties, doesn't mean it

378
00:20:33.939 --> 00:20:36.489
still has to be cool in your forties. You

379
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.989
can, you can do whatever you want. You can

380
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.890
train to run a marathon, you can redefine yourself.

381
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.189
You can say, you know what I'm gonna learn

382
00:20:44.199 --> 00:20:45.829
how to cook. I've never cooked before. You can

383
00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:48.239
say I'm gonna learn Sanskrit. I don't know like

384
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.510
there are all of these possibilities and what it

385
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.609
means to be human. And the scary part in

386
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.410
the novella, The woman destroyed is how often we

387
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.609
ignore all of the possibilities and potential for our

388
00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:03.630
life. We're not just a thing. We're not just

389
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.979
a role and that is an existentialist and a

390
00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:09.900
feminist position. And also keeping in mind that Simone

391
00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:11.359
Bobo was born, I wanna say it was like

392
00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:16.020
1908, 1906 or 1908. That her love of literature

393
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.969
and philosophy, she didn't have a huge catalog of

394
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:24.979
women to read. So what she did is she

395
00:21:24.989 --> 00:21:27.660
starts to introduce different female characters who have different

396
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.439
points of view. Whereas before her, a lot of

397
00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:32.719
female characters, when they were introduced, the fact that

398
00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:35.739
they were women was the character that that's it.

399
00:21:36.199 --> 00:21:38.890
But what Simone Du Boi in her, in her

400
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.939
novels and novellas is giving different, different character traits

401
00:21:42.949 --> 00:21:46.229
to different women. And she's doing that and pioneering

402
00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:51.229
that there wasn't that much to go on with

403
00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:54.829
writers before her. There's a few but not that

404
00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:55.310
many.

405
00:21:56.239 --> 00:21:59.119
Mhm. You know, one thing that I find really

406
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.099
interesting about all of this is the ways in

407
00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:07.589
which, uh feminism might intersect with the existentialism, existentialism

408
00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:12.030
in its more individualistic aspects. Because when it comes

409
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.199
to the feminist side of things, it seems to

410
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:18.640
me that there are these sort of common experiences

411
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:23.500
that someone who identifies, uh, within the social category

412
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:29.140
of women, uh, tend to experience collectively. But also,

413
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.689
uh, there are individual traits that different women have

414
00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:38.760
and that's where each of them might develop differently,

415
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.569
even though they might share a common experiences, socially,

416
00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:45.550
politically, et cetera.

417
00:22:47.109 --> 00:22:50.569
Yeah. Well, I mean, in the United States there's

418
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.459
definitely, um, I wanna figure out how to say

419
00:22:55.469 --> 00:22:58.339
this. There's, uh, I'll just give the example of

420
00:22:58.349 --> 00:23:02.920
white women and black women, American women. Um, THERE'S

421
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.619
a really different experience of the world and something

422
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.260
that a lot of black women writers and thinkers

423
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.540
have tried to and I think successfully, I don't

424
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.969
want to say just tried but to really, um

425
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:21.819
flesh out that distinction, that importance and that it's

426
00:23:21.829 --> 00:23:24.369
not, you know, it's not nothing, it's, it's treated

427
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.270
differently. You know, women are treated differently economically in

428
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.390
interpersonal relationships. And so I think that what existentialism

429
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.390
allows us to do is to step away from

430
00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.130
categorizing and really respecting and honoring that there are

431
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.800
um different uh different things in life where there's

432
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.829
different rules. There's a lot of rules that people

433
00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:50.770
are supposed to be following that are simply the

434
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.640
creation of man, you know, and it, it can

435
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.319
change. But I think that existentialism gives us that

436
00:23:57.329 --> 00:24:01.239
space to appreciate and acknowledge that when somebody is

437
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.739
saying this is my experience of the world to

438
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.319
take that seriously.

439
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.599
What does it mean to not really being born

440
00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:15.520
a woman but becoming a woman? What does that

441
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.410
mean? It is, you know, I, I'm wondering if

442
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.349
anybody really did that before her. And it's so

443
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:27.329
funny today that this book when she wrote that

444
00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:30.369
is 80 years ago and today in the United

445
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.390
States, there's a lot of tension over this idea

446
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.880
of what do you mean, what is a woman

447
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.770
like, kind of mocking this idea when it comes

448
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:42.890
to um issues with um transgender, transgender people. And

449
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.010
I'm thinking before I raised this 80 years ago

450
00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:54.239
and it's what she is talking about. I'm afraid

451
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.180
I'm gonna, I'm gonna like Buzzfeed this make it

452
00:24:56.189 --> 00:24:59.099
too small. But it is so interesting that the

453
00:24:59.109 --> 00:25:01.540
idea of what it means to be a woman

454
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.959
cannot just be reduced to physicality. It is something

455
00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:11.939
or biology. It is a cultural thing. And I

456
00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:14.500
know today there's a lot of resistance to that

457
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:22.060
because of the issues of transgender. Um But I

458
00:25:22.069 --> 00:25:25.400
mean, all you have to do is go around

459
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.339
the world and see what it means to be

460
00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:31.660
a woman. You can see that there are different

461
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.250
expectations, there are all these cultural things that are

462
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.819
embedded. Um And if we say that like, like

463
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:40.329
today, if you were to say, well, what is

464
00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:41.959
a man? And you were to describe a man

465
00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:44.739
as like with short hair and wears pants. That's

466
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.439
absurd. I can show you a picture of people

467
00:25:47.449 --> 00:25:50.579
throughout history of men who are definitely men, but

468
00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:53.010
that is not the costume they were wearing at

469
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.979
the time. So what she is saying is that

470
00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:58.979
to be a woman is not the same thing

471
00:25:58.989 --> 00:26:02.449
as female, which is an idea of the biology.

472
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.900
But the woman is a type of what Judith

473
00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.619
Butler would call a type of performance or presentation.

474
00:26:08.949 --> 00:26:14.319
Um It's abiding by a lot of rules. This

475
00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:16.180
is really important. I'm trying to collect my thoughts

476
00:26:16.189 --> 00:26:17.739
on this because this actually reminds me of what

477
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.619
Mary Woolton Craft couple 100 years later was trying

478
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.119
to say, is that trying to make a person

479
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.660
fit into what you think is natural, is problematic.

480
00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:34.180
And that's what Boudoir is also tackling is that

481
00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:39.680
women are reduced to nature, They're naturally X or

482
00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:43.510
they're naturally Y. And it's incredibly problematic because there's

483
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.910
no evidence as to what the nature of a

484
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.329
woman is. So if somebody wants to um say,

485
00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:54.469
well, women are naturally, you know, mothers or instinctual

486
00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:57.420
or they naturally want to have Children or they

487
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:02.010
should have Children because that is natural. And you

488
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.689
notice that that always goes for women. We don't

489
00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:08.880
talk about men naturally that way. In the same

490
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.969
way, men, naturally, we say like, oh they're, they're

491
00:27:11.979 --> 00:27:14.790
rational. They naturally want to go and create and

492
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.380
build. But women are supposed to be making babies

493
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.160
because they have that capacity. So this is one

494
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.329
of the problems with it. And this is definitely

495
00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:25.930
me being influenced by Simon de bei is that

496
00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:29.069
because you have the biological capacity for something, it

497
00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:32.500
doesn't follow that you should do that. We're putting

498
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:37.729
that burden on women, you have the biological capacity

499
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:41.130
for lots of things. The human brain, for instance,

500
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.300
has the biological capacity to know several different languages

501
00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:49.290
would we tell men you should or you, you

502
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:53.550
ought to know six different languages fluently because it's

503
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.329
naturally you're capable of doing that. Therefore, you're wrong

504
00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:58.750
and not doing it. Or here's another thing, the

505
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.890
human body is capable of long distance movement. That's

506
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.239
one of the distinguishing traits of Homo SAPIEN. How

507
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.739
many marathons have you done? It's natural. You should

508
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.300
do that. No, it's, but we're so comfortable saying

509
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.319
that because women have this biological capacity that then

510
00:28:14.329 --> 00:28:16.439
they should do it. But we don't do that

511
00:28:16.449 --> 00:28:19.959
burden in any other way. We, you know, the

512
00:28:19.969 --> 00:28:21.660
reason why I don't do marathons because I don't

513
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.359
want to. But that is not how I want

514
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.560
to spend my life. I can't imagine if somebody

515
00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:28.109
were to be like, but you should be, you

516
00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:29.619
ought to, it's moral for you to do it

517
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.939
because it's natural. No. So why would we do

518
00:28:31.949 --> 00:28:34.430
that when it comes to Children? And we don't

519
00:28:34.439 --> 00:28:36.729
do that for men. Men are the causal factors

520
00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:39.390
for pregnancy. We don't say like, oh, you were

521
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.930
supposed to be doing that. We never reduce men

522
00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:44.449
to their biological capacity in the way in which

523
00:28:44.459 --> 00:28:47.339
we do that to women. So that's where I

524
00:28:47.349 --> 00:28:51.109
think um this idea of becoming a woman is

525
00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:55.589
really saying you're culturally ascribing to all of the

526
00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:58.109
do s and don't of that society in that

527
00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.229
given time frame.

528
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.650
Yeah, I, I mean, I guess that if we

529
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.589
would uh equate uh good with what is natural,

530
00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:11.069
then we would get into very muddy waters because

531
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:16.699
it's also natural for women to very frequently die

532
00:29:16.709 --> 00:29:20.750
when giving birth. It's also natural for infants to

533
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.839
die during birth. It's also natural for people to

534
00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:27.189
die at 35 or 40 years old. So,

535
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.839
well, what you put there, that's, that's the other

536
00:29:30.849 --> 00:29:33.849
very interesting thing to me is this assumption that

537
00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:38.170
nature or natural is goodness because though all of

538
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.199
human history, what we have done is try to

539
00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:43.780
interrupt nature. That's what technology is. That's what medicine

540
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.560
is. So we don't look at um a hurricane

541
00:29:47.569 --> 00:29:49.449
and be like, that's natural is good. Don't do

542
00:29:49.459 --> 00:29:51.079
anything or we don't look at cancer and be

543
00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:54.760
like it's natural. Everything that we do is to

544
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.314
interrupt the natural course of thing. I mean, even

545
00:29:58.324 --> 00:30:01.025
us having this conversation, it's not natural for the

546
00:30:01.035 --> 00:30:05.074
internet like doing this. So I don't know why

547
00:30:05.084 --> 00:30:08.214
there is there is that presupposition built in there

548
00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:11.974
in terms of natural, that is never really addressed

549
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:14.744
or explained because in other areas of our life,

550
00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.675
we don't really put it up here. We're trying

551
00:30:16.685 --> 00:30:21.750
to do everything to not be natural and Yeah.

552
00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:23.859
Yeah, you're absolutely right. Spot on.

553
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.609
And what does it mean to live uh particularly

554
00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:33.020
from an existentialist perspective, authentically, what does it mean

555
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.099
to be authentic

556
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.040
from an existential point of view? Authenticity? And I

557
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.729
like the word authenticity as opposed to rightness or

558
00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:47.339
wrongness. Um WHAT it means to be human. So

559
00:30:47.349 --> 00:30:49.569
it's kind of tricky because the existential have to

560
00:30:49.579 --> 00:30:52.810
come up with a definition at the same time

561
00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:55.630
saying that they want to avoid definitions and absolutes.

562
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.810
So they came up with something that can encompass

563
00:30:57.819 --> 00:31:01.500
all humans. There is the fact of your existence,

564
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.459
namely when you were born, the body in which

565
00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:08.439
you were born into your first language, geography, economic

566
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:10.660
bracket. Like there are all these facts of your

567
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:15.280
existence, your nationality. And that's part of what it

568
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.540
means to be human, that you have these facts.

569
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:21.300
Then there's also the reality of being human is

570
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.579
transcendence, which means that you're not just the physical

571
00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:29.670
facts of your existence, you can do more. What

572
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.989
it means to live authentically is to accept these

573
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.939
two parts of your existence. So for example, if

574
00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:37.890
I were to say that, oh, I can't study

575
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.739
philosophy, I'm just a woman because it's a male

576
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.540
dominated field that would be bad faith that wouldn't

577
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.030
be authentic. I would be denying something that I

578
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.030
really enjoy. The transcendence is that it is possible

579
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.780
for me to study more and to do more

580
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.670
to not just be in this state of knowledge,

581
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.709
but to do more. That would mean being being

582
00:31:55.719 --> 00:31:58.530
authentic, would be understanding that I really love philosophy

583
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.989
and to pursue it more, it would be bad

584
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.910
faith to say I'm just a woman that means

585
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.780
I'm forgetting the transcendence part of my existence. And

586
00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.500
just relying on the facts of my existence. It

587
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.699
would also be inauthentic for me to say, you

588
00:32:11.709 --> 00:32:14.689
know what I can be in the W NBA,

589
00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:18.609
the women's national basketball association. I'm 53 and I'm

590
00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:21.819
terrible at sports. That would be me saying like,

591
00:32:21.829 --> 00:32:23.140
yeah, I can do it. That would be me

592
00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.060
being like all transcendence and not facts of my

593
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:29.635
existence. So to be authentic is to be in

594
00:32:29.645 --> 00:32:32.454
accepting of those two parts of what it means

595
00:32:32.464 --> 00:32:35.185
to be human. Don't say that you can't just

596
00:32:35.194 --> 00:32:39.275
do something because of, you know, the just, just

597
00:32:39.285 --> 00:32:41.635
because of the the age and the time in

598
00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:44.714
which you were born, um have some kind of

599
00:32:44.724 --> 00:32:47.324
love and appreciation for the time in which you

600
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:49.234
were born, the body into which you were born,

601
00:32:49.515 --> 00:32:52.444
but never use that as a limit to the

602
00:32:52.454 --> 00:32:59.050
things that we're capable of doing, creating, projecting ourselves.

603
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.859
She Beauvoir wrote about that action is project. We

604
00:33:03.869 --> 00:33:06.479
are literally projecting ourselves onto the world when you

605
00:33:06.489 --> 00:33:08.760
create something, when I do the podcast, when I

606
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:10.979
do good is in the details. I'm projecting myself.

607
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:14.109
I'm doing the project, putting my stamp on something

608
00:33:14.119 --> 00:33:16.300
new in the world as are you by doing

609
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.780
this? So those are the types of things that

610
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.150
it we want to take into consideration. What does

611
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.180
it mean to be authentic? Am I just living

612
00:33:25.189 --> 00:33:28.060
according to a cultural norm to that, that I

613
00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:32.020
didn't create, that I didn't invent um and to

614
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.000
find happiness in that way, like again, that was

615
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.699
Monique's downfall in the woman destroyed, she just subscribed

616
00:33:37.709 --> 00:33:40.869
to cultural norms and that was it. Um SO

617
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:46.599
authentic is when you can have that space and

618
00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:51.599
think about um what it is that you enjoy.

619
00:33:51.609 --> 00:33:55.530
What do you want to think about? Um Are

620
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.380
you saying that you like something, you're doing something

621
00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.550
just because somebody else said for you to do

622
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.089
it? That's what it means to be authentic, I

623
00:34:01.099 --> 00:34:01.500
think.

624
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.329
And apart from being, from being authentic, what does

625
00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:10.639
it mean to lead a good life, how do

626
00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:13.699
we determine what a good life is? I mean,

627
00:34:13.708 --> 00:34:16.688
is that something that I can do individually for

628
00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.929
myself or do I have to follow a specific

629
00:34:20.938 --> 00:34:23.080
steps to find that out?

630
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.070
I think this is something where I'll get into,

631
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.208
um the philosophy because the philosophy of Kamu really,

632
00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.918
really stood out to me. I also fell in

633
00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.899
love with his work. Um One of his, you

634
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.978
know, famous works in terms of fiction is, um

635
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.429
is the stranger. It's like it's a staple that's

636
00:34:43.438 --> 00:34:45.989
read in high school. I have to tell you,

637
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.320
I fell in love with Kim's work when it

638
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:52.139
came to the novella, um the fall. And it's

639
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:54.260
another one of those books that I've read over

640
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.800
and over again. And I always have to sit

641
00:34:55.810 --> 00:35:01.310
with myself afterwards. And also the Myth of Sisyphus.

642
00:35:02.379 --> 00:35:06.570
I'm gonna yield to Kamu here where he is

643
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.260
talking about living, living well or enjoying your life

644
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.820
requires letting go of this idea of order in

645
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.540
the world. He talks about the absurdity of existence,

646
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.550
not as a negative thing, but he says you

647
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.649
have to breathe with the absurd and it can

648
00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:27.449
strike anybody at a street corner. And that for

649
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:31.260
me was a really beautiful and interesting um view

650
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.060
of existence. If we are trapped in this idea

651
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.139
of order, this is the way things should be.

652
00:35:38.149 --> 00:35:41.659
We are going to suffer a lot because the

653
00:35:41.669 --> 00:35:44.379
reality of things is that, that's not the way

654
00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:47.469
life goes. Like if somebody passes away at a

655
00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:50.179
young age and we say, or they shouldn't have

656
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:53.530
or it's not supposed to be that way. While

657
00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:59.959
the death is tragic. Obviously, if you are trapped

658
00:35:59.969 --> 00:36:02.129
in this idea of, that's the way that wasn't

659
00:36:02.139 --> 00:36:05.560
supposed to happen, you're gonna have a bigger existential

660
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.709
hurdle than if you accept that the world is

661
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:13.729
a contradiction has absurdities. And then when you breathe

662
00:36:13.739 --> 00:36:16.530
with it, you're able to have more freedom and

663
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.459
more happiness. And at the end of the myth

664
00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:22.350
of Sisyphus, something that really caught me. I had

665
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.050
to sit and like, think what the hell is

666
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.550
Kamu talking about. But for any of your, for

667
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.010
any of your listeners, the myth of Sisyphus is

668
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.300
the ancient Greek myth where Sisyphus is condemned for

669
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.030
all eternity to push a boulder up a hill.

670
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.560
Only for when he gets up, it falls down

671
00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.860
and then he has to go and push it

672
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.370
back up for all eternity, pushing this boulder up

673
00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:46.070
the hill. And Kamu challenges us to think about

674
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.629
our own boulders if you will. And Kamu also

675
00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:52.179
says at the end of the myth of Sisyphus,

676
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.929
after this analysis of it, we must imagine Sisyphus

677
00:36:55.939 --> 00:36:59.379
happy. And I am telling you, I don't, I

678
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:03.679
didn't see how, how and when it dawned on

679
00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:06.429
me, the one thing that Sisyphus is in control

680
00:37:06.439 --> 00:37:08.760
of is the way in which he views that

681
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:13.489
situation, the gods were gonna punish him by giving

682
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.570
him something that they thought would be miserable. But,

683
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.250
but Sisyphus is still in charge of the way

684
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.810
in which he thinks he goes down that hill

685
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.729
the way he pushes it up, he still has

686
00:37:25.739 --> 00:37:29.550
control and freedom in those moments. And that's what

687
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.290
it means. I think for authentic living to enjoy

688
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.379
your life, you cannot be condemned. You have to

689
00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:43.530
allow that space that you have the freedom to

690
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:49.189
interpret whatever situation you are in. You don't have

691
00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:54.120
to take somebody's harsh words, for instance, as a

692
00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:57.459
declaration of who you are, you can say that

693
00:37:57.469 --> 00:37:59.909
person's crazy and toxic and I'm going to withdraw

694
00:37:59.919 --> 00:38:02.830
all my energy instead of focusing in on what

695
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.679
somebody else wants to tell you when somebody else

696
00:38:04.689 --> 00:38:06.750
wants to tell you what your value is or

697
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.409
what you're supposed to do, you can exit that

698
00:38:10.419 --> 00:38:13.159
and think differently of it and think differently about

699
00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:16.080
what your potential or possibility is what you want

700
00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.110
to do with your time. So, I think, uh,

701
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.860
excuse me, I think that living well and good

702
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.600
is to, um, be engaged in the way in

703
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:32.570
which you're participating in the world. Be engaged. Don't,

704
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.419
um, don't be afraid of limitations that other people

705
00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:37.870
want to put on you. Right. Like if somebody

706
00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:39.979
says you're too old to do something like you're

707
00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:43.290
too old to learn how to do blank, forget

708
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.189
it. You're not, you can do whatever you want.

709
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.959
It is such a strange feeling when you just,

710
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.540
it hits you. Like Camus said, you can be

711
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.629
at the street corner and the absurd hits you

712
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.370
when it hits you that you can do whatever

713
00:38:57.379 --> 00:39:01.209
you want, you can think however you want. And

714
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.239
when you are honest about that, then you're able

715
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.919
to be more receptive to other people's humanity as

716
00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.709
well. When other people feel stuck or if they're

717
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:12.370
in a system that is trying to pin them

718
00:39:12.379 --> 00:39:15.399
down when you understand the value of freedom and

719
00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:18.280
that space for thinking, then you're able to appreciate

720
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.840
people when they are in a situation where somebody

721
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.159
is trying to put them down and to try

722
00:39:23.169 --> 00:39:25.560
to assist in that freedom and alleviate and alleviate

723
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.350
that pain or that injustice, I think.

724
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.100
Great. So I guess this is a good point

725
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.679
to ask you about uh let's say a, a

726
00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:40.350
question related to how we uh relate to other

727
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.040
people because of course, human life is not just

728
00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.679
about us as individuals, but also there's a big

729
00:39:46.689 --> 00:39:50.060
element of our social lives, how we relate to

730
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.280
other people in different ways. And I know that

731
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.610
you teach, for example, courses on the philosophy of

732
00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.620
sex and love. That's a very big component of

733
00:39:59.629 --> 00:40:02.729
how we relate to other people. So, I mean,

734
00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:07.389
from perhaps again, an existentialist perspective, what would you

735
00:40:07.399 --> 00:40:10.879
say? Uh HOW do you look at how the

736
00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:14.270
sexes relate to one another and the role that

737
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.449
things like love, romance and sex play in our

738
00:40:18.459 --> 00:40:19.010
lives?

739
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.669
Yeah, it's, you know, there's been recently a lot

740
00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:26.429
of work on um I know it's an American

741
00:40:26.439 --> 00:40:29.149
culture I can't speak for, for other um other

742
00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:30.770
areas of the world, but that there's been a

743
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.830
bit of a demise. Um There has been this

744
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.409
perceived threat to men and what is considered to

745
00:40:40.419 --> 00:40:45.110
be masculine. And so there's been this backlash of

746
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.679
um of of anger um uh between, between the

747
00:40:49.689 --> 00:40:55.419
sexes in terms of heterosexual relationships. And because there's

748
00:40:55.429 --> 00:40:59.149
been this upheaval in the United States of this

749
00:40:59.159 --> 00:41:01.479
questioning of just the very things that we've been

750
00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:05.179
talking about. Like, do I have to get married?

751
00:41:05.189 --> 00:41:07.540
Do I have to have Children by this age?

752
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.629
Um Can I take care of myself? And so

753
00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.729
there have been a lot of shifts and I

754
00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.300
want to say a lot of it came from

755
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.139
the seventies and that, and this is so again,

756
00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:22.540
I wanna make sure that I'm clarifying, this is

757
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.350
in American law. But, um, there was a big

758
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.790
shift, I wanna say it was at the very

759
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.709
end of the sixties, one of the biggest shifts

760
00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:32.709
when it came to relationships is that in some

761
00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:35.959
states it was up to the states who they

762
00:41:35.969 --> 00:41:38.959
would marry. So it could be illegal to be,

763
00:41:38.969 --> 00:41:40.870
or it could be perfectly legal to be in

764
00:41:40.879 --> 00:41:43.689
a state where the judge would not marry you

765
00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:46.439
based on race. And that was just in a

766
00:41:46.449 --> 00:41:50.659
few states, not every state, the Supreme Court ruled

767
00:41:50.669 --> 00:41:53.354
that that was illegal in all 50 states. That

768
00:41:53.364 --> 00:41:55.645
was a really big shift in the understanding of

769
00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:59.794
love because remember law is the expression of our

770
00:41:59.804 --> 00:42:03.854
values. And so when the law made it, that

771
00:42:03.864 --> 00:42:06.294
it is legal for you to marry somebody that

772
00:42:06.304 --> 00:42:09.774
is not of the same race, um that started

773
00:42:09.784 --> 00:42:13.804
to put into motion, this idea that you are

774
00:42:13.814 --> 00:42:17.004
allowed to love and to be engaged with people

775
00:42:17.014 --> 00:42:20.860
of your choosing. Like this restriction is lifted. It's

776
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.239
not, you know, it would be considered illegal. It

777
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.979
would be considered in this country. Very dangerous for

778
00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:28.959
black men to be in relationships with white women.

779
00:42:28.969 --> 00:42:31.169
It would be a threat to their lives. That's

780
00:42:31.179 --> 00:42:34.340
how serious it was. So, just on the cusp

781
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.320
of the seventies, you have this big shift in

782
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.149
what is legally allowed in relationships then. You have

783
00:42:40.159 --> 00:42:42.949
this big shift where Title nine is introduced and

784
00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:46.510
Title nine in the seventies said that any public

785
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.149
institution had to give an equal amount of funding

786
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.909
to women's groups, sports as to men. So the

787
00:42:52.919 --> 00:42:56.429
concept of the female athlete is really born because

788
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:59.360
before that women could play sports, but there was

789
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.989
no coach, there was no team, there were no

790
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.219
uniforms, there was no equipment now that exists. And

791
00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:08.209
now all of a sudden young girls in, let's

792
00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:10.889
say, junior high and high school, they have something

793
00:43:10.899 --> 00:43:13.840
to do after school. They're not just thinking about

794
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.080
their boyfriends, they're not just thinking about how pretty

795
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.100
they are for their boyfriends. They're thinking about a

796
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.330
personal goal where they're working with other young women

797
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.719
to achieve something that's huge. That changes the mindset.

798
00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:28.639
Right. All of a sudden women have something other

799
00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:31.120
to do than worry about their boyfriends or if

800
00:43:31.129 --> 00:43:34.000
they're gonna be picked to be married or whatever

801
00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:38.340
they have goals now that belong to them. Um,

802
00:43:38.459 --> 00:43:40.409
AND then the other change is that in the

803
00:43:40.419 --> 00:43:43.469
late seventies, women could have their own checking account,

804
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.600
their own banking account. This changes everything. Oh, and

805
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.770
no fault, divorce. I'm sorry. Also, this means that

806
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.350
women, well, you could leave a marriage based on

807
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.510
the fact that you don't want to be there

808
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.729
anymore before that you could only get a divorce

809
00:43:59.739 --> 00:44:02.090
if you could prove and it would be up

810
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.810
to a judge to decide that your spouse did

811
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.239
something wrong. You would have to prove that. So,

812
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.919
uh, and it didn't go over well, like there

813
00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:14.300
were some judges that would say things to women.

814
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:17.050
Like, well, he only hit you twice. You know,

815
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.260
like it would be up to a judge to

816
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.560
decide if you could leave a marriage. So no

817
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.590
fault, divorce, meaning that you don't have to prove

818
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.520
this. Something did something wrong. You can simply just

819
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.360
leave exit that relationship because you don't want to

820
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:34.580
be in it anymore. Those things changed the trajectory

821
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:42.399
of relationships because relationships before then depended on economics.

822
00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:44.969
Meaning you did not necessarily have to love who

823
00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:47.479
you were married to. You just had to be

824
00:44:47.489 --> 00:44:50.409
provided for women had to be provided for by

825
00:44:50.419 --> 00:44:52.510
their husbands. And if the husbands wanted to climb

826
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.260
the corporate ladder, they had to show that they

827
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:57.800
were protecting a wife and kids. So people, the

828
00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.179
desire or attraction was not part of the equation.

829
00:45:00.189 --> 00:45:05.370
It was just economic survival. You remove economic survival

830
00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:06.590
because all of a sudden women can have their

831
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.469
own checking accounts. Um Women do not have to

832
00:45:09.479 --> 00:45:12.330
be married in order for economic survival, they can

833
00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.679
have their own goals. All of a sudden men

834
00:45:15.689 --> 00:45:21.090
are like they making money is not sufficient for

835
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.850
them to have a wife and for women like

836
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.780
they have all these other choices. And so I,

837
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:32.709
I don't know, I think that that made improvements.

838
00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:34.449
This is my point of view. But some people

839
00:45:34.459 --> 00:45:37.030
say that was a detriment to relationships from my

840
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.189
point of view. The fact that when you are

841
00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:42.659
with somebody, it is not because you have to,

842
00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:45.070
but it is because you want to. And the

843
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.179
fact that you can exit that relationship is actually

844
00:45:49.189 --> 00:45:53.149
what gives that relationship its value. Knowing that every

845
00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:56.419
day when you wake up, you are choosing to

846
00:45:56.429 --> 00:45:58.639
be with that person and respecting the fact that

847
00:45:58.649 --> 00:46:01.459
that person is choosing to be with you. That

848
00:46:01.469 --> 00:46:03.280
is what gives its value. The fact that they

849
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:06.360
could choose not to. The fact that when they

850
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:09.560
are with you every single day is a testament

851
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.540
to their appreciation and reaffirming the choice. It's not

852
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.389
that you just got married one day, but you

853
00:46:15.399 --> 00:46:17.800
don't have to think about it anymore. It's the

854
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.120
fact that yeah, you do and you constantly have

855
00:46:20.129 --> 00:46:22.439
to work together and evolve is what gives it

856
00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:26.790
its value. And so the dynamics have shifted. And

857
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.360
like I said, there's a lot of people who

858
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.330
are not on board with this shift. They want

859
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.510
to say that women are just good for making

860
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.370
babies and for taking care of the home. And

861
00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:40.870
then when they say things like that, women will

862
00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:43.469
say this too. This isn't just men when they

863
00:46:43.479 --> 00:46:47.719
say things like that, then people are saying, well,

864
00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.489
you know, you're just not valuing my choice. I

865
00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:56.500
mean, I think there's also this unnecessary tension by

866
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.489
suggesting that women who want to be, stay at

867
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.689
home moms and take care of their Children and

868
00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:04.669
they enjoy the domestic labor and they enjoy taking

869
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:08.590
care of their man that somehow that is um

870
00:47:08.699 --> 00:47:11.010
negated or not of value or they're not allowed

871
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.790
to want everything all at once. Like have the

872
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.340
career, have the Children, have the hubby. Like there

873
00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.620
doesn't need to be that tension. I think the

874
00:47:18.629 --> 00:47:22.979
most important thing is you allow people to discover

875
00:47:22.989 --> 00:47:25.290
what works for them and there shouldn't be a

876
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.860
legal hurdle from that. So the most important thing

877
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.760
is the legal hurdles removed, saying that a woman

878
00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.620
like couldn't exit a relationship or couldn't have particular

879
00:47:34.629 --> 00:47:37.469
jobs. That's the most important thing. But culturally is

880
00:47:37.479 --> 00:47:40.429
taking some time to pick up on that one

881
00:47:40.439 --> 00:47:43.370
second. There we go. Ok.

882
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.080
Uh Yeah. So, uh I mean, there are many

883
00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:49.750
aspects to all of this. I'm going to comment

884
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.620
on a few of them and please feel free

885
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:53.669
to comment on what I'm about to say. But

886
00:47:53.679 --> 00:47:56.399
I guess that first of all, uh I think

887
00:47:56.409 --> 00:47:58.709
it's a bit silly for people to just assume

888
00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:03.010
that women back in the fifties, sixties and even

889
00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:08.083
before that were happy, just Gao's wives because we

890
00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:12.103
know that many of them took psychiatric pills and

891
00:48:12.113 --> 00:48:16.742
got drunk because they couldn't stand their marriages anymore,

892
00:48:16.752 --> 00:48:20.062
but they just couldn't opt out of them. And

893
00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:22.163
then, I mean, when it comes to this more

894
00:48:22.173 --> 00:48:26.032
recent backlash of course, I think it derives very

895
00:48:26.042 --> 00:48:29.926
much from the sort of uh uh cultural norms,

896
00:48:29.936 --> 00:48:33.125
uh uh this cultural legacy that we have from

897
00:48:33.135 --> 00:48:37.775
these gender roles that were established decades ago, centuries

898
00:48:37.785 --> 00:48:41.525
ago. And we also, we still live with that,

899
00:48:41.535 --> 00:48:44.406
or at least people still have that in their

900
00:48:44.416 --> 00:48:48.246
minds collectively. But also, I guess that another aspect

901
00:48:48.256 --> 00:48:52.459
to consider here is the fact that uh economics,

902
00:48:52.469 --> 00:48:56.550
it changed a lot, particularly after the 2008 economic

903
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.850
crisis. I mean, it's much harder now for people

904
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.340
to get stable jobs to get a good income.

905
00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:07.870
And also that also influences people settling down or

906
00:49:07.879 --> 00:49:11.219
getting partners. Because I mean, I always look back

907
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.844
to Japan, for example, in the late eighties, early

908
00:49:14.854 --> 00:49:18.885
nineties where they had a big economic crisis. And

909
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:23.044
it was exactly at that point where marriage rates

910
00:49:23.054 --> 00:49:27.534
started plummeting and we have much, many more single

911
00:49:27.544 --> 00:49:32.094
people now because before that people went to university

912
00:49:32.104 --> 00:49:35.915
and then they had a guaranteed job because there

913
00:49:35.925 --> 00:49:41.149
were this sort of uh private public relations between

914
00:49:41.159 --> 00:49:44.199
the state and certain big companies in Japan. So

915
00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:48.969
whoever finished university until up, the late eighties would

916
00:49:48.979 --> 00:49:53.159
have a guaranteed job for life. So it would

917
00:49:53.169 --> 00:49:56.129
be almost impossible for them to be fired and

918
00:49:56.139 --> 00:49:58.840
all of that. So there's also that component. And

919
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.510
also, I mean, I think there's also component of

920
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.659
since women started going to university and they found

921
00:50:06.669 --> 00:50:09.800
out that they could have their own careers or

922
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.260
own, earn their own money. They could be more

923
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:18.679
independent and many women nowadays just report that they

924
00:50:18.689 --> 00:50:21.500
like that kind of thing. I mean, they like

925
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.830
to be independently, they like to earn their own

926
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.409
money. And so many women nowadays just look for

927
00:50:28.419 --> 00:50:33.070
things in their partners beyond them, earning more than

928
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.159
them or something like that. And if men get

929
00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:40.800
into this sort of red pill, black pill men

930
00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.870
movement on the internet and so on, then they

931
00:50:43.879 --> 00:50:46.070
hear all the time that it's all because of

932
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.354
feminists, all of women being hyper grams or something

933
00:50:51.364 --> 00:50:54.925
like that, then perhaps they don't develop the sorts

934
00:50:54.935 --> 00:51:00.195
of traits that women, many women nowadays prefer. I

935
00:51:00.205 --> 00:51:01.985
mean, I don't know, what do you think about

936
00:51:01.995 --> 00:51:02.534
all of that?

937
00:51:02.985 --> 00:51:04.925
I do. It's I think one of the mistakes

938
00:51:04.935 --> 00:51:06.844
and this is one of the issues with the

939
00:51:06.854 --> 00:51:10.389
whole nature thing or one becomes a woman. Um

940
00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:13.879
The, the idea is that there was just this,

941
00:51:13.889 --> 00:51:16.060
you know, binary idea of what it meant to

942
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.780
be a man versus a woman. And what we're

943
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:21.889
finding is that actually this is from Mary Wilson

944
00:51:21.949 --> 00:51:24.169
craft to Simon de bois is that a lot

945
00:51:24.179 --> 00:51:26.350
of the things that were deemed masculine are just

946
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.030
human. And so like me studying philosophy is not

947
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.310
me being masculine, it's me being human or you

948
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.159
know, this idea, like you said, independent, that's not

949
00:51:36.169 --> 00:51:39.770
being masculine, that's just being human. That's what human

950
00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.909
beings crave they like creativity. Um They do like

951
00:51:43.919 --> 00:51:48.169
family relationships. So by the same token, um men

952
00:51:48.179 --> 00:51:53.209
who enjoy being fathers, taking care of their babies,

953
00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:57.500
taking care of their Children. Um YOU know, the

954
00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:01.620
that they're not being feminine, they're being human. That's

955
00:52:01.629 --> 00:52:04.090
what it means to be a parent. So a

956
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.209
lot of these ideas about what constitutes femininity and

957
00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:10.229
masculinity. If you notice a lot of the stuff

958
00:52:10.239 --> 00:52:14.060
that's described as masculine is actually human. And then

959
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:18.000
what is described as feminine is almost animal, like,

960
00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:19.959
like the way we would describe a dog as

961
00:52:19.969 --> 00:52:25.080
being good dog, a great pet. Um OBEDIENT does

962
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.209
what it's a, it has all these lessons. But

963
00:52:27.219 --> 00:52:30.459
what it takes to become feminine to become a

964
00:52:30.469 --> 00:52:34.229
woman requires a lot of training. So for example,

965
00:52:34.239 --> 00:52:35.620
I have a daughter as you've seen her like

966
00:52:35.629 --> 00:52:38.719
run around and everything. She is no different from

967
00:52:38.729 --> 00:52:41.225
the little boys in her preschool just wants to

968
00:52:41.235 --> 00:52:44.524
run around, makes messes falls down, wants to climb

969
00:52:44.534 --> 00:52:49.375
stuff that is just human over time. What people

970
00:52:49.385 --> 00:52:52.514
will do is they'll start to say like quite,

971
00:52:52.524 --> 00:52:55.864
quite, you know, they'll try to, you know, quiet

972
00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:57.354
her or say why don't you play with the

973
00:52:57.364 --> 00:53:00.985
doll instead of the ball like start they so

974
00:53:00.995 --> 00:53:08.070
being feminine requires not taking up space, it requires

975
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:12.399
being small, being quiet and that is antihuman and

976
00:53:12.409 --> 00:53:17.350
that is training like that's what that is. And

977
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.189
I think the same thing for young men told

978
00:53:21.199 --> 00:53:25.469
not to cry. Now, crying is a human emotion

979
00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:28.610
but being told not to, requires a lot of

980
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.449
training and a lot of stuffing down of feelings

981
00:53:32.459 --> 00:53:37.030
that ends up exploding. So this, you know what

982
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.709
war was suggesting? This idea of, you know, becoming

983
00:53:40.719 --> 00:53:44.129
a woman is really led to the trajectory of

984
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:50.649
masculine and feminine. When we just scratch the surface,

985
00:53:51.679 --> 00:53:55.179
it's not a natural state at all. It's, it's

986
00:53:55.189 --> 00:53:58.239
not. Um, NOW there are all by the same

987
00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.189
token I happen to like a lot of things

988
00:54:01.199 --> 00:54:03.350
that are feminine. I mean, I get my nails

989
00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.159
done, I get my hair done. I, I like

990
00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:08.610
pink. I can't help it. I just do, I

991
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.340
will always, I will like pink. Um There are

992
00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.379
things like that. There are things like that but

993
00:54:13.389 --> 00:54:16.540
I can't be, I don't want to be pigeonholed

994
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:19.810
in that I'm not allowed to because I'm because

995
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.770
I'm a feminist or something like that. You know

996
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.409
what I mean? Um I think that we just

997
00:54:25.419 --> 00:54:29.919
have to give people the space to be and

998
00:54:29.929 --> 00:54:32.239
the thread when I thought about it with this

999
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:37.000
backlash. Um I haven't totally understood it. Like why

1000
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:40.479
is it that people are so upset when men

1001
00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:43.189
will be a little bit more feminine or women

1002
00:54:43.199 --> 00:54:45.280
are a bit more masculine? Like why are people

1003
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:48.800
so angry about that? And I think it has

1004
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:53.270
to do with, in an economic structure. It has

1005
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.459
to do with power that femininity is not, it

1006
00:54:56.469 --> 00:55:01.169
does not yield like any kind of economic power.

1007
00:55:01.179 --> 00:55:03.989
And so when a man displays anything that would

1008
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.649
be deemed feminine, it is such a, it's such

1009
00:55:06.659 --> 00:55:09.669
an insult, a loss of power or if women

1010
00:55:09.679 --> 00:55:13.000
display any masculine traits, it's a trend to take

1011
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:17.389
of power when really what we are doing is

1012
00:55:17.399 --> 00:55:20.370
we're just being like, that's what it is. It's

1013
00:55:20.379 --> 00:55:23.370
not trying to like me having my own checking

1014
00:55:23.379 --> 00:55:27.770
account, producing a podcast, getting sponsors making money from

1015
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.469
that. And then also being in the university system

1016
00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:33.370
is not me trying to claim power from somebody

1017
00:55:33.379 --> 00:55:35.929
else. I'm not trying to take away from anybody.

1018
00:55:35.939 --> 00:55:39.810
It is just me expressing myself and same thing

1019
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.250
with, I think that's what Bobo was really advocating

1020
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.429
for. When you read her work. It's not um

1021
00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:50.010
a lot of it is following the trappings of

1022
00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.770
not being authentic. It's not like this girl power

1023
00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.320
thing of wonder woman and women taking over or

1024
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.669
anything like that. When you read her stuff, it's

1025
00:55:58.679 --> 00:56:02.409
cautionary to see what happens when you don't live

1026
00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:06.149
your authentic stealth. Yeah, I think I lost, I

1027
00:56:06.159 --> 00:56:08.229
think I lost the, the original question there. I

1028
00:56:08.239 --> 00:56:09.219
hope that works.

1029
00:56:09.229 --> 00:56:12.050
Uh No, I mean, I just put on the

1030
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.659
table several different thoughts that I have about where

1031
00:56:15.669 --> 00:56:18.489
this backlash comes from and what led to the

1032
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:22.879
sort of dating slash mating con context that we

1033
00:56:22.889 --> 00:56:25.969
live in right now. And uh I just wanted

1034
00:56:25.979 --> 00:56:27.489
for you to comment on that. I mean,

1035
00:56:27.915 --> 00:56:30.165
yeah, it's huge. Well, I'll, I'll give you one,

1036
00:56:30.175 --> 00:56:32.885
I'll give you one example. And this was so,

1037
00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:34.774
this was so disturbing and so upsetting and I

1038
00:56:34.784 --> 00:56:37.314
brought it up with my class because the philosophy

1039
00:56:37.324 --> 00:56:40.064
of sex and love class, the subtitle of it

1040
00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:43.004
is current debates and sexuality, which means that whatever

1041
00:56:43.014 --> 00:56:44.935
is going on in the news, I didn't realize

1042
00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:46.205
there was so much sex in the news. But

1043
00:56:46.215 --> 00:56:48.185
there is like, ever since I've been teaching this

1044
00:56:48.195 --> 00:56:50.364
class, I like something comes up all the time,

1045
00:56:50.685 --> 00:56:53.645
but this came up. This is really, really disturbing

1046
00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.689
and it generated new laws as a result of

1047
00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:59.870
this. But you know, Taylor Swift is like after

1048
00:56:59.879 --> 00:57:02.000
Time magazine's People of the year, she's on top

1049
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:06.610
of her game, right? And what was the backlash

1050
00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:11.750
to that? Somebody decided to generate a I um

1051
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.090
pornographic images of her and put it on the

1052
00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.669
internet and it took a good, like it took

1053
00:57:16.679 --> 00:57:18.580
a good like 10 to 12 hours before that

1054
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.270
was taken down. That is now illegal right now.

1055
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.050
They have to create a law to say it

1056
00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:31.419
is illegal to make pornographic images of somebody. And

1057
00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:36.449
but the the pornographic images were extremely demeaning in

1058
00:57:36.459 --> 00:57:40.439
a sexual manner. And that is the backlash that

1059
00:57:40.449 --> 00:57:43.409
Taylor Swift got for what, what did she do?

1060
00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:47.459
What was her crime being a successful woman in

1061
00:57:47.469 --> 00:57:50.659
her industry? That's the crime. So how are we

1062
00:57:50.669 --> 00:57:53.310
gonna get back at her. We're gonna show what

1063
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.899
it looks for her to be in not just

1064
00:57:55.909 --> 00:57:59.770
sexual but in demeaning to reduce her to an

1065
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.489
animal status as something that is to be used.

1066
00:58:03.129 --> 00:58:07.709
That is the kind of backlash that, that people,

1067
00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:11.739
that people get. And it's similar with, with racism

1068
00:58:12.149 --> 00:58:15.350
that when somebody is at the top of their

1069
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.830
game, then you'll notice that the reply will be

1070
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.969
reducing, that person will be like going to some

1071
00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:27.560
sort of a racial or ethnic slur. And here

1072
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.830
is the thing or when it comes to sexism,

1073
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.969
racism or ethnic type of slurs, the one thing

1074
00:58:33.979 --> 00:58:37.409
that we can say when that happens is it,

1075
00:58:37.419 --> 00:58:41.129
that means the person who's throwing that out has

1076
00:58:41.139 --> 00:58:45.250
nothing. They have nothing, they've got nothing to say

1077
00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:51.090
except for that except for something that is, it's

1078
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:54.229
an effort to try to bring somebody down when

1079
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:56.689
you've got no reason to put them down. It

1080
00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:59.969
shows that you've got nothing up here because what

1081
00:58:59.979 --> 00:59:03.239
is the argument against Taylor Swift? Right? What is

1082
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.959
the argument when it comes to, let's just say

1083
00:59:04.969 --> 00:59:09.540
like Beyonce is also an extremely talented artist and

1084
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:13.639
it's just extraordinary what, what is left but some

1085
00:59:13.649 --> 00:59:17.629
sort of a combination of racism and sexism and

1086
00:59:17.639 --> 00:59:20.219
why it means you've got nothing, it means you

1087
00:59:20.229 --> 00:59:23.830
have nothing intellectual to say. Um And we saw

1088
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.250
that with, um you know, we've seen that with

1089
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:31.909
uh different figures, whether it's political or athletes when

1090
00:59:31.919 --> 00:59:34.750
that stuff comes out, I would really like for

1091
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.100
it to stop. But when that stuff comes out,

1092
00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.370
it also just goes to show the terrible weakness

1093
00:59:40.379 --> 00:59:42.969
in whatever the backlash is. And this attempt to

1094
00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:46.870
hold on to power because it's always going back

1095
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:48.979
to some sort of a power structure that is

1096
00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:52.989
being eradicated and which we realized that power structure

1097
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.750
was based on nothing like when it comes to

1098
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.659
racism, that power structure was based on a perceived

1099
00:59:58.669 --> 01:00:05.399
hierarchy that was arbitrary, arbitrary. And when somebody wants

1100
01:00:05.409 --> 01:00:08.000
to go back to that by using those kinds

1101
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:11.330
of that kind of language, they in existential terms,

1102
01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.439
they are not being authentic to themselves. They're appealing

1103
01:00:13.449 --> 01:00:16.179
to a structure that is just nothing like it's

1104
01:00:16.189 --> 01:00:18.850
just nothing but that's the kind of thing that

1105
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:24.860
when we're talking about sexuality um and backlash when

1106
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.969
women are just claiming their own space, when people

1107
01:00:27.979 --> 01:00:31.100
of color are just claiming their own space, just

1108
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.500
claiming to take up space in their talent. Um

1109
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:38.419
The resistance to that gets uglier, the more powerful

1110
01:00:38.429 --> 01:00:42.139
they are. But that ugliness also tells us how

1111
01:00:42.149 --> 01:00:44.500
much that needs to be eradicated as well and

1112
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:45.500
how weak it is.

1113
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.820
Uh So I I was also interested in hearing

1114
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:54.840
your thoughts about um the sex industry and sex

1115
01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.159
workers because I know that uh for example, among

1116
01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:02.790
feminists, this is also a very contentious topic. There

1117
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.110
are more, I mean, I know that these are

1118
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.780
not the precise terms but I, I will call

1119
01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:14.290
them sex positive and sex negative feminists. Feminists who

1120
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.600
are completely against the sex industry, pornography, prostitution and

1121
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:23.219
all of that and others that, uh, are not

1122
01:01:23.229 --> 01:01:27.449
against it. Uh, uh, THEY are not necessarily for,

1123
01:01:27.459 --> 01:01:30.239
but they are not against it. So, where do

1124
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:33.580
you stand on that topic since we're also talking

1125
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.820
here about, uh, sex?

1126
01:01:37.209 --> 01:01:41.280
Yes, I think, um, there is a lot, there

1127
01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.790
is a lot to, to unpack with this topic.

1128
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.879
I thought about it in the United States. It's,

1129
01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:49.590
um, it's illegal. I think when it comes to

1130
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.719
sex work, I think the parameters are when it

1131
01:01:52.729 --> 01:01:55.379
comes to, um, if it's ok if I'm explicit

1132
01:01:55.389 --> 01:01:58.030
but I think it's, uh, any kind of penetration,

1133
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.540
I think any kind of exchange of fluids, then

1134
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.120
that's when it is illegal. But if it is,

1135
01:02:04.129 --> 01:02:05.889
um, if that does not take place then it's

1136
01:02:05.899 --> 01:02:10.780
legal. So you can, um, do like internet type

1137
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:14.060
stuff. You can, um, be a stripper ad, you

1138
01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:17.270
know, dancer. Like that's all legal. It's all under

1139
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.010
the umbrella of sex work though, is essentially when

1140
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.750
it's some sort of an exchange for money for

1141
01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.860
some sort of sexual gratification pleasure and some of

1142
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:28.209
it is illegal. Some of it is not. And

1143
01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:30.340
I've been thinking about why is it that sex

1144
01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.120
work, um, let's say when it comes to something

1145
01:02:32.129 --> 01:02:36.489
like prostitution, why is that illegal? Because normally when

1146
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.030
it comes to something needs to be illegal, it

1147
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.520
presupposes there's some sort of harm involved. Any law

1148
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:46.280
you look at is um an attempt to alleviate

1149
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.510
or prevent or minimize harm. So when you look

1150
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.959
at business is legal and sex is legal, so

1151
01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.479
why would it be illegal to mix the two

1152
01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:58.580
of them? And I was trying to find the

1153
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:02.300
harm and I found it, but it's not a

1154
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.510
war. I think this is my theory. I think

1155
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.800
that what it is that when it comes to

1156
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:13.030
women's sexuality, um the man historically is always benefited.

1157
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.199
So let's just say in a western wedding ceremony,

1158
01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:18.409
you've got the woman is in white for the

1159
01:03:18.419 --> 01:03:23.159
bride that's to represent her virginity. But that's sexual,

1160
01:03:23.169 --> 01:03:26.090
that's she's pure. She's in the white and then

1161
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.639
her father is walking her down to give her

1162
01:03:28.649 --> 01:03:32.199
away. So he is, she is the property of

1163
01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:35.209
her father and she is pure and he's got

1164
01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:37.889
this hot commodity that he's walking down the aisle

1165
01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:41.669
and then is asked who takes her? And it's

1166
01:03:41.679 --> 01:03:45.709
the next man and then her name is transferred

1167
01:03:45.719 --> 01:03:48.530
from her father's to her new husband. It's a

1168
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.649
transfer property. Don't mention this. If anybody is getting

1169
01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:53.370
married any time soon, it'll ruin it. I don't

1170
01:03:53.379 --> 01:03:55.610
think that women who are genuinely excited to get

1171
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.340
married now or like I can't wait to be

1172
01:03:57.350 --> 01:03:59.850
like transferred. You know, and I don't think dads

1173
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.800
who are so proud to be walking their daughter

1174
01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:05.439
down the aisle are like misogynistic people. Like I'm

1175
01:04:05.449 --> 01:04:08.709
just talking about the tradition itself. How I'm gonna

1176
01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:10.449
get back to this is that you can see

1177
01:04:10.459 --> 01:04:13.570
that um men are the ones who have been

1178
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.600
exchanging the woman when women are getting money for

1179
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:24.949
theirselves. That's the offense. Women are now trading their

1180
01:04:24.959 --> 01:04:28.520
sexuality and they are the recipients of the funds

1181
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:32.199
for that, not somebody else. And I think that

1182
01:04:32.209 --> 01:04:36.600
is the offense. Um I think that when it

1183
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:40.719
comes to, when it comes to sex work, um

1184
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.120
the other thing we need to keep in mind

1185
01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.620
is that it's the women who are shamed. It's

1186
01:04:46.629 --> 01:04:49.560
mostly women, men do. Um There are male sex

1187
01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:52.899
workers, but it is primarily women because it is,

1188
01:04:52.909 --> 01:04:56.370
uh it's primarily a male clientele because men are

1189
01:04:56.379 --> 01:04:59.550
the one who are seeking that out more. Um

1190
01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.040
And the women are the ones who are shamed

1191
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.280
for it because of the idea that they're not

1192
01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.310
supposed to want sex, they're not supposed to get

1193
01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.159
money for it, but men are not shamed in

1194
01:05:10.169 --> 01:05:12.439
the same way because we treat men as though

1195
01:05:12.449 --> 01:05:17.860
it makes sense that they're sexual. So I think

1196
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.699
that when it comes to our attitudes of sex

1197
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:21.760
work, we have to really pay attention to. First

1198
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:24.399
of all, it makes a lot of money. That's

1199
01:05:24.409 --> 01:05:29.689
the reality. We women who are on only fans

1200
01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:33.060
or they are, you know, they're, they're making a

1201
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:37.310
lot of money through sex work. And that also

1202
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.389
seems to be the other offense. And if you

1203
01:05:40.399 --> 01:05:43.250
really want to do something about sex work or

1204
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:48.709
minimize it, you have to make other options appealing.

1205
01:05:49.719 --> 01:05:51.860
I mean, if it, if you can make more

1206
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:57.620
money in sex work, then you can, um, getting

1207
01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:01.820
over 100 grand in debt from an education or

1208
01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.199
to become a lawyer or a doctor, you know,

1209
01:06:04.209 --> 01:06:07.689
like, or to be a teacher. Right. Like you

1210
01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:10.060
have to make the other things more appealing. I

1211
01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.340
would like to get rid of the shame around

1212
01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:16.379
it. But I also have to be um completely

1213
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:20.540
like honest. This is a complicated topic. I absolutely

1214
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:24.399
despise the idea of shaming a woman um who

1215
01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:26.820
is making, who is making money. I also want

1216
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:29.280
for her to be protected legally because that's also

1217
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:32.840
vulnerable for abusive situations. And if you're already doing

1218
01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:35.199
something illegal, it's infinitely more difficult to go to

1219
01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:37.560
the police and say get protection because in the

1220
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.969
United States that's illegal. Um If they are killed,

1221
01:06:42.979 --> 01:06:46.639
right, nobody's looking for them. There's so that kind

1222
01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:52.719
of thing. Absolutely. Um Crushes me. I can see

1223
01:06:52.729 --> 01:06:54.959
it in our own American politics right now. The

1224
01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:58.389
way that this trial of Donald Trump is being

1225
01:06:58.399 --> 01:07:02.030
handled, um that both left wing and right wing

1226
01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.219
media are disparaging. Stormy Daniels, who is the adult

1227
01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:09.760
film actress. That's kind of the impetus of all

1228
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:14.070
of this and both the liberal left. They will

1229
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.260
always say porn star, Stormy Daniels and why are

1230
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:20.020
they doing that? They are highlighting the fact that

1231
01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:24.300
she is in sex work to embarrass Trump. I

1232
01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:25.949
am not a fan of Trump by the way

1233
01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:29.719
to be clear. But if Stormy Daniels had any

1234
01:07:29.729 --> 01:07:32.899
other profession, if she was a dentist, do you

1235
01:07:32.909 --> 01:07:35.209
think, how often do you think they'd mentioned dentist,

1236
01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:39.780
Stormy Daniels and her case c they're using, they're

1237
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:45.899
using that they're degrading her, the implication to embarrass

1238
01:07:45.909 --> 01:07:48.540
him And right wing media is doing the same

1239
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:51.760
thing. They are talking about her as a porn

1240
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:55.820
star in order to embarrass and diminish her credibility.

1241
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:59.050
That why would he be with her? And so

1242
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.030
in the way in this climate, if you were

1243
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.959
in sex work, you are less than human, you

1244
01:08:03.969 --> 01:08:07.909
are not protected. And I'm it, that's awful. And

1245
01:08:07.919 --> 01:08:09.639
then when you make a lot of money at

1246
01:08:09.649 --> 01:08:15.000
it, then you're even more despised. So this is

1247
01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:16.399
the complexity of it. So I want to be

1248
01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:18.990
100% transparent. I also I have a daughter, you

1249
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.720
know, the one that you've been seeing running around.

1250
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.500
If she were to say this is what she

1251
01:08:22.509 --> 01:08:24.390
wants to do for a living, for a profession,

1252
01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:29.020
I would want her to do something else. So

1253
01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:32.129
that's the complexity of it, right? Like if I'm

1254
01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.620
being transparent, I don't want any woman to be

1255
01:08:34.629 --> 01:08:36.009
in danger. I don't want any woman to be

1256
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.120
shamed. Um And at the same time, it's not

1257
01:08:39.129 --> 01:08:41.310
a profession that I think that I would want

1258
01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.890
my daughter to aspire to. So that's why I

1259
01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:46.410
have to be completely honest and then I have

1260
01:08:46.419 --> 01:08:49.600
to think about why. And it's because maybe this

1261
01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:51.509
is like the second wave versus the third wave

1262
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.029
feminism. Right? There's a part of me that would

1263
01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.770
just, um, that I, I think that there would

1264
01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:05.370
just be um more to, more, to enjoy out

1265
01:09:05.379 --> 01:09:11.620
of life. Um, SO I, at the same time,

1266
01:09:11.629 --> 01:09:13.790
I never like, I, I don't know, it's, it's

1267
01:09:13.799 --> 01:09:16.830
a complicated issue and I think that it's important,

1268
01:09:16.839 --> 01:09:19.290
I mean, that, that I am transparent about that.

1269
01:09:19.299 --> 01:09:22.770
Like I can't, I can't run around and um

1270
01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:26.089
pretend as though that is something that I would,

1271
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.879
that I, I would say that I want for

1272
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.450
my daughter to aspire to in the same way

1273
01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:34.450
I want for her to aspire to other professions.

1274
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:37.850
So, but what I would love to do is

1275
01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:42.979
um just create a society where that is beneficial

1276
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:47.100
where that is a path or that men have

1277
01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:51.944
authentic relationships with women in their lives where um

1278
01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.265
but you know, it's like, well, what, what is

1279
01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.665
the draw to sex work? Why are you spending

1280
01:09:56.674 --> 01:09:59.314
your money on this? What, what is going on?

1281
01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:01.935
Is there some way for you to get that

1282
01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:04.134
in your interpersonal life? To be honest about your

1283
01:10:04.145 --> 01:10:06.745
own sexuality, to be honest about what you want

1284
01:10:06.754 --> 01:10:09.035
in the bedroom so that you don't need to

1285
01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:12.265
go outside of a relationship to go pay for

1286
01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:16.854
it out elsewhere. Like there's also so much um

1287
01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:22.200
There's also so much that's closed in relationships like

1288
01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:25.080
I'll, I'll give you an example when this is

1289
01:10:25.089 --> 01:10:27.620
early on and good is in the details. I

1290
01:10:27.629 --> 01:10:30.839
was in touch with a professional Dominatrix and she

1291
01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:34.149
had a, a dungeon in um in downtown L

1292
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.950
A and she invited for me to come and

1293
01:10:36.959 --> 01:10:39.879
interview her and she has a phd in psychology

1294
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:42.689
and she and I are about the same age.

1295
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.859
And um I invited my friend who is also

1296
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.589
in academia that I met through Simone de Bois

1297
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.020
conferences, Dr Ellie Anderson and Ellie now has her

1298
01:10:52.029 --> 01:10:55.870
own fantastic podcast called overthink. That's also philosophy based.

1299
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:58.879
And so I asked Ellie if she would come

1300
01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:01.020
with me because Rudy, you know, Rudy is very

1301
01:11:01.029 --> 01:11:03.689
conservative and he's a big wig lawyer. He, he's

1302
01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.959
like, I'm, this is not for me and I'm

1303
01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:08.109
like, I, I study philosophy, I can do this.

1304
01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.029
So um and I was also curious, right? I

1305
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.089
was just totally curious. So here's a woman this

1306
01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.290
is under the umbrella of sex work. She's a

1307
01:11:15.299 --> 01:11:18.220
phd in psychology and she has a place and

1308
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:21.549
toys and yeah, I wanna go see. But something

1309
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.729
that really stood out to me was that all

1310
01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.810
of the evidence of um being more honest with

1311
01:11:27.819 --> 01:11:30.470
your sexuality. And if it includes the Deviant stuff

1312
01:11:30.479 --> 01:11:34.209
like B DS M that when people are allowed

1313
01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.330
to express that they are healthier and happier in

1314
01:11:36.339 --> 01:11:40.439
their everyday lives and that she has men who

1315
01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:44.350
she is the only person in a lot of

1316
01:11:44.359 --> 01:11:47.959
men's lives who are familiar or know what their

1317
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:51.399
needs are and what they want. And she's able

1318
01:11:51.439 --> 01:11:56.089
to offer that to them with 100% secrecy privacy.

1319
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.009
But they are able to explore a part of

1320
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.500
themselves with this woman that they're not able to

1321
01:12:01.509 --> 01:12:04.240
anywhere else. And so I think to me that's

1322
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.279
one of the issues, especially when it comes to

1323
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:09.250
these ideas about masculinity and femininity. What is it

1324
01:12:09.259 --> 01:12:12.569
that men are afraid to admit that they want

1325
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.379
from a partner and the more open you are,

1326
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.640
then you can find the right partner or partners

1327
01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:20.009
if you want an open relationship, a poly amorous

1328
01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.970
relationship, um a non monogamous relationship, but you still

1329
01:12:23.979 --> 01:12:25.790
want your person but you want all these other

1330
01:12:25.799 --> 01:12:29.859
things. And so that's also important when we're talking

1331
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:32.450
about sex work. I think that our fascination and

1332
01:12:32.459 --> 01:12:35.589
our demonizing on the women who are making money

1333
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.290
is, is one of the biggest cultural problems. Um

1334
01:12:39.979 --> 01:12:44.000
But it's also why, um why is, is the

1335
01:12:44.009 --> 01:12:46.029
industry there in the first place and have an

1336
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.120
open and honest conversation about that?

1337
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:52.330
Yeah. So, uh let me just quickly give my

1338
01:12:52.339 --> 01:12:55.560
two cents on the topic and please, if you

1339
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.609
agree or disagree with anything, I'm about to say,

1340
01:12:58.759 --> 01:13:02.120
uh tell me so, but uh uh I mean,

1341
01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:04.850
this is a, a very complex topic. I agree

1342
01:13:04.859 --> 01:13:08.419
with you but, uh, I'd rather turn on it

1343
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:12.720
from both sides of the aisle. The feminists who

1344
01:13:12.729 --> 01:13:14.799
are in favor of it, the feminists who are

1345
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:18.439
against it and also some empirical research and I

1346
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.950
guess that, uh, the, the ideas that come to

1347
01:13:21.959 --> 01:13:26.549
mind the are that, of course, there's the harm

1348
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.009
side of it. And I guess that with that

1349
01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.729
in mind, at least in certain circumstances, it would

1350
01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.299
be good for it to be legalized because that

1351
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:38.870
way it's easier for sex workers to get access

1352
01:13:38.879 --> 01:13:44.790
to help, to denounce particular situations, to persecute particular

1353
01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:46.839
people and so on. It's easier for them to

1354
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:50.649
do that that way. And also when it comes

1355
01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.569
to, I, I heard this is very interesting. I've

1356
01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:58.140
heard, uh, a discussion one time between only fans

1357
01:13:58.149 --> 01:14:01.270
girls. It was three of them, they were debating

1358
01:14:01.279 --> 01:14:05.089
a conservative guy and one of them said that

1359
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:09.979
he asked them, oh, would you if, if you

1360
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:12.330
met a girl? And she was saying that she

1361
01:14:12.339 --> 01:14:15.370
would like to be only friends cam girl or

1362
01:14:15.379 --> 01:14:18.140
something like that, would you, what would you tell

1363
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:22.310
her? And she was very honest and sad. Well,

1364
01:14:22.319 --> 01:14:24.120
I, I guess I would tell her that it

1365
01:14:24.129 --> 01:14:28.910
would depend on her personality traits because I like

1366
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:31.509
being an only fans girl, but it's because of

1367
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.370
my personality. So I don't know exactly what kinds

1368
01:14:35.379 --> 01:14:38.430
of traits she was referring. To, I would imagine

1369
01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:42.549
like uh in the case of being an escort

1370
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:47.350
scoring high on socio sexuality, like liking to be

1371
01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:52.189
with multiple uncommitted partners, something like that. Or perhaps

1372
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.629
when it comes to personality traits being more open

1373
01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.229
to experience something like that, I, I mean, I

1374
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.830
don't know the exact details there. Uh AND then

1375
01:15:02.109 --> 01:15:06.779
when it comes to uh things I've read from

1376
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:11.129
sex workers themselves, of course, there's a multitude of

1377
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:15.060
different experiences that they report. They report, but some

1378
01:15:15.069 --> 01:15:20.350
of them actually report positive experiences with their clients

1379
01:15:20.359 --> 01:15:23.555
and some of them, even men, for example, when

1380
01:15:23.564 --> 01:15:27.305
it comes to clients with certain needs, men with

1381
01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:31.205
disabilities, for example, that they are the only way

1382
01:15:31.214 --> 01:15:35.634
they can have access to sex and be sexually

1383
01:15:35.645 --> 01:15:39.924
satisfied because otherwise it's virtually impossible for them to

1384
01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:44.225
have sex with women or with whatever kinds of

1385
01:15:44.234 --> 01:15:49.950
partners they prefer. Uh And then there's also organizations

1386
01:15:49.959 --> 01:15:53.129
out there, like for example, I've, I've read about

1387
01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.799
organizations in the UK and the US, specifically in

1388
01:15:56.810 --> 01:16:01.529
Las Vegas, I think where ex prostitutes organize and

1389
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.229
they go out on the streets and they identify

1390
01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:09.229
if people who are selling sex and they approach

1391
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.169
them and give them a pamphlet or something like

1392
01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.350
that. And so you look, if you are ready

1393
01:16:15.359 --> 01:16:19.669
or if you'd like to leave this business, your

1394
01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.229
work, then come to us, we will help you.

1395
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.390
So I think that's also very positive. Uh I

1396
01:16:26.399 --> 01:16:29.770
I mean, those are just the immediate thoughts that

1397
01:16:29.779 --> 01:16:32.439
come to my mind. There would be many, many

1398
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:36.069
other things to talk about. But uh, what do

1399
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.399
you think of that?

1400
01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:42.330
Yeah, I think um, one of the, see in

1401
01:16:42.339 --> 01:16:44.410
the United States there are also um we just

1402
01:16:44.419 --> 01:16:48.419
have weird feelings around sex and sexuality. And so

1403
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:53.060
this idea of it being a, just um this

1404
01:16:53.069 --> 01:16:57.129
idea of it being like, um a fun or

1405
01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:03.140
pleasurable experience. Like there's something very funny about um

1406
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:12.089
hi about um about American culture where we just,

1407
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:15.169
we make, we make sex sound like it's just

1408
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:18.509
completely private and dirty and there's only one way

1409
01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.149
to do it and things like that. And so

1410
01:17:21.419 --> 01:17:24.250
when I think that's also why sex work um

1411
01:17:24.259 --> 01:17:27.529
has become so or is so popular, it's because

1412
01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:31.000
that's not the way that that's not the way

1413
01:17:31.009 --> 01:17:33.950
that sex works. It's not just like this, it's

1414
01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:36.310
not just to make a baby real fast. And

1415
01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.379
then that's the end of the story. You know,

1416
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:40.750
there's a way, there's, there's a lot of closeness,

1417
01:17:40.759 --> 01:17:44.709
there's communication, there's playfulness and we don't ever talk

1418
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.109
about sex in that way. In fact, um a

1419
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.910
lot of places in the United States, if you

1420
01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.899
get sex education, it's really just describing a fertilized

1421
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:54.830
egg. It's not actually talking about sex. And so

1422
01:17:54.839 --> 01:17:57.950
people are just confused and not understanding or they're

1423
01:17:57.959 --> 01:18:00.109
taught that it is just some dirty thing that

1424
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.430
you're only, maybe only supposed to experience with one

1425
01:18:02.439 --> 01:18:05.899
person. And so then you have like, you know

1426
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.459
what you're talking about where there's this um people

1427
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:11.319
are enjoying themselves and there's this playfulness to it.

1428
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:14.089
And one woman who was in sex work, she

1429
01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.049
described it to me. She said I provide an

1430
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.540
experience like, like a, like a masseuse she was

1431
01:18:18.549 --> 01:18:21.250
describing and I thought I'd never looked at it

1432
01:18:21.259 --> 01:18:26.979
that way. Um But I think that one of

1433
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:29.000
the assumptions is that um people who are in

1434
01:18:29.009 --> 01:18:31.600
it need to be rescued and they don't want

1435
01:18:31.609 --> 01:18:34.229
to, but there's a lot of women. Um AND

1436
01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.399
men as well that this is something they want

1437
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.470
to do. The money is good. It's fun, it's

1438
01:18:38.479 --> 01:18:42.330
playful and they enjoy it. Um So I think

1439
01:18:42.339 --> 01:18:45.060
that again, one of the things that I think

1440
01:18:45.069 --> 01:18:47.430
when we start to have a better idea about

1441
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:51.580
sex education and the value of healthy self, sexual

1442
01:18:51.589 --> 01:18:54.649
relationships and by value, I mean that it's a

1443
01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:58.020
form of communication, closeness, a way to understand yourselves.

1444
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:02.100
It's a very human thing. Then you can start

1445
01:19:02.109 --> 01:19:05.314
to see the decrease of the phenomenon or the

1446
01:19:05.325 --> 01:19:08.674
allure of sex work as a profession. Like there

1447
01:19:08.685 --> 01:19:10.125
are so many things that need to be in

1448
01:19:10.134 --> 01:19:13.575
place. But as long as we are secretive about

1449
01:19:13.584 --> 01:19:16.194
sex or talk about it as though like certain

1450
01:19:16.205 --> 01:19:19.334
positions or certain ways of doing it or wrong,

1451
01:19:19.725 --> 01:19:23.700
you're always gonna have that sex work where people

1452
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:25.979
are going to find it and, you know, you

1453
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:29.259
seek it out, they're gonna do it when people

1454
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:31.790
are not open. Um, BUT I do think the

1455
01:19:31.799 --> 01:19:35.939
idea of being rescued, I don't think that applies

1456
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:39.250
to everyone in, in sex work. And so,

1457
01:19:39.259 --> 01:19:42.680
isn't it also a little bit condescending or can

1458
01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:44.729
be a little bit condescending?

1459
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:48.089
Yeah. Yeah, because some women, like, I mean, I

1460
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.770
think, I know what show you're talking about where

1461
01:19:49.779 --> 01:19:51.720
they have, they have a conservative person and they

1462
01:19:51.729 --> 01:19:54.680
have sex workers on their only fans and there's

1463
01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:57.410
just kind of, there's just such a disconnect. It's,

1464
01:19:57.419 --> 01:19:59.669
I mean, as far as a show, I guess

1465
01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.720
it works because you've got like, these two, um,

1466
01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:05.290
opposite sides of the spectrum. But what I have

1467
01:20:05.299 --> 01:20:08.129
noticed with shows like that is that the men

1468
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:11.149
seem so comfortable in the way in which they

1469
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.770
disparage the women, the way they talk about them.

1470
01:20:14.779 --> 01:20:18.529
Like Candace Owens who is a conservative thinker. She

1471
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.500
was on a show like that and she said

1472
01:20:20.509 --> 01:20:23.629
to these women, um, I think your whole life

1473
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.850
is fascinating. It's ho flash and, you know, whole

1474
01:20:27.859 --> 01:20:31.250
short for a slang for horror. And I, I

1475
01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:33.540
was just stunned, this is a woman who talks

1476
01:20:33.549 --> 01:20:36.589
about her Christianity and she's sitting there and talking

1477
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.549
about women as though they are nothing to their

1478
01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:42.970
faces. And it was just like, it was just

1479
01:20:42.979 --> 01:20:46.189
extraordinary to me that she felt so comfortable in

1480
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.859
talking to these women and just to their face

1481
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:51.250
calling them that, um, and it's a way to

1482
01:20:51.259 --> 01:20:55.310
just flatten somebody's personality. So women who engage in

1483
01:20:55.319 --> 01:20:58.160
sex work, women who make money from that, uh,

1484
01:20:58.169 --> 01:21:01.919
don't forget. Like they also have friends, they have

1485
01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:04.379
family members. Um, THEY also want to go to

1486
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:06.450
the movies. Maybe they thought the end of Game

1487
01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:09.620
of Thrones sucked too. Like they, they have all

1488
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:12.060
these other parts to them and we're willing to

1489
01:21:12.069 --> 01:21:15.129
do that from any, for any other employment. Right.

1490
01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:18.080
Like, I think, I mean, my students know for

1491
01:21:18.089 --> 01:21:20.859
instance that when I'm on campus and I'm teaching

1492
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:22.879
and I'm the professor that is just one way

1493
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:25.689
of me being. But I clearly am a mom

1494
01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.689
also. I'm also a partner. I'm somebody who likes

1495
01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.399
to cook every once in a while and somebody

1496
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:31.770
likes to go on hikes every once in a

1497
01:21:31.779 --> 01:21:33.680
while. Like there are all these other aspects to

1498
01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:37.759
my personality. Um, WE know that for every worker,

1499
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.549
we know that when you go to a restaurant

1500
01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.950
and you're, you know, you're ordering something from a

1501
01:21:42.959 --> 01:21:45.310
server, you know, that they have an end to

1502
01:21:45.319 --> 01:21:47.779
their shift that their whole life isn't about bringing

1503
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:50.649
you food. But Candace Owens and some of these

1504
01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:53.819
other thinkers are perfectly comfortable in treating a woman

1505
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:57.529
who is making money and actually has work hours

1506
01:21:57.569 --> 01:21:59.890
as though that's her entire life and she has

1507
01:21:59.899 --> 01:22:02.350
nothing else outside of that and therefore it's ok

1508
01:22:02.359 --> 01:22:04.169
to talk about her, like she is a thing.

1509
01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.990
So, or he, you know, like I said, men

1510
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.140
are, men do this as well. It's mostly women

1511
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:10.120
but men do it as well.

1512
01:22:10.129 --> 01:22:13.290
Also. Sorry for interrupting. But I guess that when

1513
01:22:13.299 --> 01:22:17.819
it comes specifically to conservative women and some of

1514
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:22.720
the sex negative feminists are also conservative is that

1515
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:27.200
they look at sex, uh, female sex workers as

1516
01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:28.120
competition.

1517
01:22:29.299 --> 01:22:31.149
I think that's part of it. I think it's

1518
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.200
because, I mean, that's who their husbands are going

1519
01:22:33.209 --> 01:22:36.100
to, right? Like that's, I think that's part of

1520
01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:40.200
the, I think that's part of it. And I

1521
01:22:40.209 --> 01:22:43.339
think one of the under um the other like

1522
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:47.169
myths that have been taught to women, um is

1523
01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:50.220
that your power is in your sexuality and in

1524
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:54.220
your appearance and women who have bought into, that

1525
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.379
are the ones who are angry, right? Like, uh

1526
01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.419
but the truth of the matter is that that's

1527
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:03.310
not your, your power doesn't come from your physical

1528
01:23:03.319 --> 01:23:07.350
appearance. Your power comes from, from your capacity for

1529
01:23:07.359 --> 01:23:11.910
empathy, listening, learning, being curious, that's genuine power. Even

1530
01:23:11.919 --> 01:23:14.020
financial power, right? Like a lot of women are

1531
01:23:14.029 --> 01:23:16.330
bought into this idea that if you spend all

1532
01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:20.649
your money on plastic surgery or expensive bags, you're

1533
01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.069
gonna be more powerful because your power is in

1534
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.220
your looks. When actually if you took that financial

1535
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:28.779
money, you took that money and invested it, bought

1536
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:31.450
more property. For instance, you've got a lot more

1537
01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:35.819
power. So we've convinced women that power is in

1538
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:38.859
their capacity to look young and to be an

1539
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:42.700
object of desire. And if you buy into that,

1540
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:45.220
then you're gonna be angry at women who have

1541
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:48.370
successfully become an object of desire. You're gonna be

1542
01:23:48.379 --> 01:23:51.060
pissed at them because you're perceiving that that is

1543
01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:54.709
power and that's not, it's not power.

1544
01:23:56.529 --> 01:24:00.120
Great. So, Doctor Dolsky, I'm getting really mindful of

1545
01:24:00.129 --> 01:24:03.270
your time. So perhaps it's better for us to

1546
01:24:03.279 --> 01:24:06.220
wrap up the interview here. Maybe if you're open

1547
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:08.589
to it somewhere in the future, we can do

1548
01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.339
a second

1549
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:11.740
episode and I'll have a better, I'll have a

1550
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:12.680
better backdrop.

1551
01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:18.359
Uh So just really quickly before we go, where

1552
01:24:18.370 --> 01:24:21.859
can people find you on the internet? And in

1553
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:26.299
which places can they find your goodies in the

1554
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:27.540
