00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.759
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loops.

3
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.880
And today I'm joined by Doctor Joshua Nobi. He

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.800
is Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics and Psychology at Yale

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.158
University. A lot of his recent research has been

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.469
concerned with the impact of people's moral judgments on their

7
00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:23.638
intuitions about questions that might initially appear to be entirely

8
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.719
independent of morality. But as we're going to talk

9
00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.339
about today, apparently they are not. So Josh

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.259
, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.859
everyone. Thanks Ricardo. It's really good to be

12
00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:39.500
here. So I would like to start by asking

13
00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:46.179
you about experimental philosophy. So what is experimental philosophy

14
00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:50.189
? Really? And how does it differ from,

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.270
let's say armchair philosophy? Yeah. Awesome question.

16
00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:58.649
So experimental philosophy is the field that started around 20

17
00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.759
years ago in the beginning of the 21st century.

18
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.069
And it's a field that really is the merger of

19
00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.349
two different things. So on one hand, it

20
00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.719
uses these methods that are the methods we see all

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.290
the time in psychology. So we run experiments that

22
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.870
very much look like psychology experiments and use the same

23
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.010
statistics, the same kinds of experimental designs that you

24
00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.028
see all the time in the field of psychology.

25
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.948
But at a kind of theoretical level, it's really

26
00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.230
very closely connected to philosophy. So there's this tradition

27
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.159
in philosophy, going back thousands of years of thinking

28
00:01:30.168 --> 00:01:33.689
about, for example, thought experiments where if you

29
00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:36.388
open up some work from Plato, you'll see him

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.739
thinking. OK, let's talk about the concept of

31
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.189
justice. Um Now consider this case, would you

32
00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:44.088
say that's justice? Now, what about this,

33
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.959
this justice and gradually trying to understand what justice is

34
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.180
by considering thought experiments of that type. So experimental

35
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.459
philosophy is a field that kind of merges those two

36
00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.120
things. So it's a field that's drawing on this

37
00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.138
very long tradition within philosophy of trying to understand these

38
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.019
concepts using this particular kind of approach to understanding them

39
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.028
and the methods that we see in psychology of just

40
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.610
running systematic experiments, analyzing them using data and so

41
00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:12.719
forth. So what you see in an experimental philosophy

42
00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.750
study is something that might look a little bit like

43
00:02:14.758 --> 00:02:16.750
what Plato is doing in some sense except for that

44
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.008
instead of um just seeing well, consider this case

45
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.118
surely. In that case, people would say this

46
00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.403
, it's we say consider this, we recruited 1000

47
00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:29.264
participants, they were randomly assigned to conditions in a

48
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.324
three by two design. We analyzed what their responses

49
00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:35.663
were and we can see that people's responses are affected

50
00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.014
by these factors. Now we're trying to develop a

51
00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:42.284
deeper understanding of what's going on within people's minds that

52
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.544
shapes those judgments, what's going on in human cognition

53
00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:49.469
that makes them have the judgments they do. But

54
00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.429
how does it differ from science? I mean,

55
00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.550
if in terms of methodology, it seems so similar

56
00:02:55.558 --> 00:03:00.860
to what we see across several different sciences, then

57
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.189
why isn't it uh also science? Why is it

58
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.389
still philosophy? That's a great question. And I

59
00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.599
think that the answer is that we should all think

60
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.599
less about that. So if you, if you

61
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.830
look at what's actually happening with this field of the

62
00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:20.439
experimental philosphy experimental philosophy studies are just being published in

63
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.788
the same journals that or every other cognitive science um

64
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.500
kind of paper is being published in. So for

65
00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:28.330
example, the journal Cognition, which is one of

66
00:03:28.338 --> 00:03:30.679
the leading journals in the field of cognitive science,

67
00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.849
a quantitative study of where experimental philosophy papers get published

68
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.020
, showed that one of the most common places to

69
00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.770
publish them is cognition. And when you send a

70
00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:40.659
paper to cognition, they don't do some special philosophy

71
00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.819
way of thinking about it. They're just thinking about

72
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.508
it as a contribution to cognitive science. So it's

73
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.550
not as though there's some kind of sharp divide that

74
00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:53.308
we really want to say we are not scientists,

75
00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.990
we're philosophers and the things we're doing are not contributions

76
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.949
to science, they are contributions to philosophy, which

77
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.710
is something separate. But although there's no sharp divide

78
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.949
like that, I really feel like there is an

79
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.429
important difference that there really is something different about what's

80
00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.189
going on. So if you think about, for

81
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.919
example, this field that's at the intersection of psychology

82
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.649
and economics in which people are trying to study what's

83
00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.139
going on in people's minds that affects their economic decision

84
00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.350
making. And there are people working in that field

85
00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:23.129
who are psychologists and there are people working in that

86
00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.100
field who are economists. I mean, it's not

87
00:04:26.108 --> 00:04:27.678
like there are two separate fields. I mean,

88
00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.470
there is a field of studying this but still there's

89
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.670
a difference that when an economist studies those questions,

90
00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:34.939
it's different than when a psychologist studies, those questions

91
00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.720
that economists are drawing this whole theoretical tradition that they

92
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.879
, when they were um grad students, they were

93
00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.928
like studying real analysis and like um microeconomic theory and

94
00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.358
and then they're bringing to bear that whole tradition on

95
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:53.290
these questions. I mean, you think about what's

96
00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:55.338
going on in experimental philosophy, I feel like you

97
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.048
see something really similar that it it might not be

98
00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.899
a rigid dichotomy between what we're doing and what people

99
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.199
outside of philosophy are doing. But there's something really

100
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:05.858
clear if you open up one of these papers,

101
00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.470
you can tell it's written by a philosopher that it's

102
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.290
drawing on this kind of really rich theoretical tradition that

103
00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:15.730
all of us in philosophy have been steeped in from

104
00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:19.338
our undergraduate to graduate school through all of the um

105
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.329
interactions we're having now in philosophy departments and the research

106
00:05:24.338 --> 00:05:26.129
we're doing is really coming out of that, that

107
00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.449
we've been thinking about Aristotle for decades. And the

108
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.988
study we're doing is very much influenced by that whole

109
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.459
tradition, right? But I mean, I guess

110
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.858
that this also puts into perspective, the relationship between

111
00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:44.449
science and philosophy because in many ways there, there's

112
00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:47.540
not and uh there's uh there should, there should

113
00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:53.459
necessarily be a strict division between the, let's say

114
00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:56.345
two fields of knowledge. I mean, historically speaking

115
00:05:56.355 --> 00:06:00.144
, of course, science even derived from philosophy.

116
00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:04.475
But nowadays, even when people try to make a

117
00:06:04.483 --> 00:06:09.125
strict division and say that philosophy is from the humanities

118
00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.744
, and then we have the sciences which are two

119
00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.894
separate things. Uh It doesn't have to be like

120
00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:19.035
that, right? We I really strongly agree that

121
00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:24.069
a lot of times experimental philosophy is presented as something

122
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.899
new as the it's kind of rebelling against the tradition

123
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.709
of philosophy. But I completely agree with what you

124
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.178
just said, it should be seen instead as something

125
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:35.178
old that if you look at um what was going

126
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.819
on in the 19th century in philosophy. When you

127
00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:42.709
think about these figures like Karl Marx Friedrich, Nietzsche

128
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.129
Jon Stewart Mill, these people were very concerned with

129
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.939
empirical questions, questions about what human beings are really

130
00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.259
like. And then they were trying to explore all

131
00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:57.470
those empirical questions using all the methods that were available

132
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.470
at that time to explore those questions and then there

133
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.069
was kind of this new fangled revolution against all of

134
00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.939
that, that people start to say all that stuff

135
00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.588
that people traditionally did in philosophy. That's not even

136
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.139
philosophy, that's just science, philosophy. Is this

137
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.619
other thing that you can do from your armchair without

138
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:16.910
even um engaging with empirical data. And I think

139
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.649
that that revolution against the traditional way of doing philosophy

140
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.149
was just totally mistaken. There was never anything wrong

141
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.678
with the traditional way of doing philosophy, that what

142
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.528
those people were doing in the 19th century was just

143
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.059
totally right. And we should just go back.

144
00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:33.850
It was the exactly the right approach that we should

145
00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:39.019
have this met mode of inquiry where we're not um

146
00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:43.139
distinguishing really strictly between these different things. We're trying

147
00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.829
to go after these questions with all the methods at

148
00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:47.970
our disposal. And we're exploring questions that are kind

149
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.899
of recognizably philosophical. But we're exploring those questions by

150
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.798
engaging with all the empirical data we can get that

151
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.449
will help us answer them. So after that introduction

152
00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:05.319
, let's get into some of the topics you explore

153
00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:09.500
in your work. So first of all, what

154
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.759
is belief, what is belief? But in the

155
00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:15.678
work that we've done on this topic, what we're

156
00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.879
concerned with is how ordinary people figure out what other

157
00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:22.639
people believe. So, um there's something in our

158
00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:28.500
minds that allows us to figure out what other people

159
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:33.038
believe about. So if I um am uh thinking

160
00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:35.259
about another person, I might think. Um Even

161
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:37.440
though I'm right here in my office, she doesn't

162
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.279
know that she thinks that I'm at home. So

163
00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:43.639
she believes that I'm at home. I know a

164
00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.769
question arises like, uh about how to understand the

165
00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:50.509
concept how people think about. So, here's what

166
00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:52.029
we thought about that. Here's what we argue for

167
00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:56.808
, with regard to that question that are more basic

168
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.168
way of that human beings make sense of why other

169
00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:01.099
people do the things they do is not in terms

170
00:09:01.109 --> 00:09:03.379
of what they believe in terms of what they know

171
00:09:03.969 --> 00:09:07.500
. So the normal way of thinking about things is

172
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:09.288
that I would just think, ok, you know

173
00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:09.899
, I'm right now, I'm in my office.

174
00:09:09.908 --> 00:09:13.349
Does she know that or not? And that way

175
00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:16.200
of thinking about things, thinking about what other people

176
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.479
know is something that's really fundamental and so fundamental that

177
00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:22.739
it's very much shared with our other, with other

178
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.609
primates and presumably with our common ancestor, with those

179
00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:28.989
other primates and something that's just totally automatic. It

180
00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:31.399
, it as soon as you see someone else and

181
00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:33.379
you're seeing like what they're looking at and what they're

182
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.558
not looking at, you immediately are aware of which

183
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.119
things they know and which things they don't know.

184
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.519
And then the suggestion we had is that this ability

185
00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:43.599
that human beings have to think that other people could

186
00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:46.580
believe something that's not true. That should be seen

187
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.788
as this fancy extra ability like something that only human

188
00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:52.779
beings have, other primates don't have it. So

189
00:09:52.849 --> 00:09:56.859
this suggestion, we're making a sort of a reversal

190
00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:58.330
of the way cognitive scientists have often thought about this

191
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.340
. The cognitive scientists have often thought the most basic

192
00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:03.599
aspect of how we make sense of other people's minds

193
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:05.210
is by thinking about what they believe and what they

194
00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.599
want. And then we're suggesting, no, it's

195
00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:09.639
the most basic way of thinking about it is in

196
00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:13.509
terms of what people know and what they want and

197
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:16.889
then what they believe is when you're doing that you're

198
00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.639
doing, like, just a very sophisticated thing that

199
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:20.940
goes beyond the way people normally understand each other.

200
00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:28.759
But how should we go about distinguishing between belief and

201
00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.440
knowledge? I mean, what does really count as

202
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:37.099
knowledge? Oh. So, um, maybe a

203
00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:39.269
helpful thing to think about in terms of what things

204
00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:41.558
really come to his knowledge is to understand that what

205
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.658
knowledge is, is not just the same thing as

206
00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:46.359
beliefs that happen to be true. Mhm. So

207
00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:50.700
, suppose there's an object and it's aimed at particular

208
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.700
place and then the object is like moving all around

209
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.440
while I'm not looking at it, it's moving all

210
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.139
, it's moving here, it's moving there and then

211
00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:00.899
just randomly it happens to move back to the exact

212
00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:03.308
place that it was when I was, when I

213
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.070
was looking at it, then if I hadn't been

214
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.750
looking at it this whole time, I might believe

215
00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.808
it's in this place and it really is in this

216
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.330
place. But I don't know, it's in this

217
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.269
place. It's just, I was just lucky.

218
00:11:15.178 --> 00:11:16.308
So, in a case like that, you might

219
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.479
think, I believe it. And it's true,

220
00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:24.080
but I don't actually know it. So, the

221
00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:26.058
, the key idea now that we were introducing is

222
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.330
that, um, that this ability to figure out

223
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.320
which things people know and which they don't know,

224
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:35.178
this is something shared with our, with other primates

225
00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.668
and this ability to figure out what things people believe

226
00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:43.460
is not. So suppose you do it um this

227
00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.629
task now with a chimpanzee. So um I put

228
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:50.000
something in this, in this place and you're watching

229
00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.428
me put it in this place and then you look

230
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.219
away. So just try it out so our viewers

231
00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:56.509
can see. OK. Can you look away for

232
00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.119
a second? Yeah. OK. So now while

233
00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:01.418
you're looking at it just stays in this place and

234
00:12:01.428 --> 00:12:03.200
now it's in this place, you can't, you

235
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.158
can't see it. Now turn back. OK.

236
00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:07.399
Now once you turn back, I as the other

237
00:12:07.408 --> 00:12:11.359
, um as a chimpanzee would expect that when you're

238
00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:11.759
trying to get it, say it's a piece of

239
00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:15.158
food that you'd look here and you wouldn't look here

240
00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:16.879
but not consider a different kind of case. So

241
00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:20.320
suppose I put the object in this place and then

242
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.739
you look away. Now, while you're looking late

243
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.379
, let's try, can you demonstrate while you're looking

244
00:12:24.418 --> 00:12:26.149
at the object moves all around, it's moving,

245
00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:28.440
it's moving, it's here, it's here. Ok

246
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.969
. Now, look back. So now just by

247
00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:35.308
chance it happened to end up in the same place

248
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.908
that it was when you looked away. Another question

249
00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:41.460
is where does the chimpanzee expect you to go when

250
00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.629
you're trying to find it? And the answer is

251
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.200
chimpanzees are just completely a chance. They think it's

252
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.149
totally random which place you go. So that seems

253
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:52.009
to indicate chimpanzees can figure out which things you know

254
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:54.879
, but they can't figure out which things you believe

255
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:56.450
, you believe it's here, but you don't know

256
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.139
it's here. So they have no idea where you

257
00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:01.859
think it is. Yeah. And from the perspective

258
00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:07.779
of cognitive science, what is more basic representations of

259
00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:13.538
knowledge or representations of belief? And that at least

260
00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:15.678
what we suggest. And this is in a paper

261
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.668
that's where the lead author is, Jonathan Phillips is

262
00:13:18.678 --> 00:13:22.469
that the more basic thing is knowledge. And in

263
00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:24.908
that way, we're sort of going against what a

264
00:13:24.918 --> 00:13:28.279
lot of cognitive scientists have traditionally thought like that.

265
00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:30.899
A lot of cognitive scientists traditionally thought if you want

266
00:13:30.908 --> 00:13:33.849
to understand basically how I make sense of your mind

267
00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:37.099
, the most basic thing to understand is how I

268
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:41.109
figure out what you think. And then our suggestion

269
00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:43.379
is people can figure out what you think, but

270
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:46.129
that's not the thing they're using most generally. Maybe

271
00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:48.619
they use that in cases where something weird is happening

272
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:50.808
. And so they can't use their more basic approach

273
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.369
and the more basic approach is to figure out what

274
00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:56.808
, you know. So I don't know if this

275
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.820
will be a helpful example. But um, I

276
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.739
, if we're going to your home and we're just

277
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.450
walking on the street, I immediately have this sense

278
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.298
that, you know, where your home is and

279
00:14:07.308 --> 00:14:11.788
then my ability to think about the fact that you

280
00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:13.009
know, where your home is. So we're gonna

281
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.538
go to the right place, doesn't rely in any

282
00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:16.700
way on my ability to attribute beliefs to you,

283
00:14:20.418 --> 00:14:22.788
right? So, uh uh and le let's now

284
00:14:22.798 --> 00:14:28.129
talk a little bit about uh causal judgments and norm

285
00:14:28.139 --> 00:14:31.879
violations because you've done some work on that. So

286
00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:37.109
do norm violations interact with causal judgments. And if

287
00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:41.119
so how, yeah, so a lot of studies

288
00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:43.509
show that um when you're judging whether one thing caused

289
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:48.399
another thing, then people tend to think that people's

290
00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.639
judgments about whether this cause that depend on whether they

291
00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:52.869
think that this thing is right or wrong or good

292
00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:54.658
or bad. So you, I'll just give an

293
00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:58.558
example to explain it. So imagine that you're in

294
00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:01.820
the philosophy department and the receptionist has a, has

295
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.308
some pens on her desk. So now, um

296
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.649
the there are like two pens on her desk and

297
00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:11.460
the rule of the department is that administrative assistants are

298
00:15:11.469 --> 00:15:13.229
allowed to take the pens, but professors are not

299
00:15:13.239 --> 00:15:13.700
supposed to take pens from the desk, they're just

300
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.369
supposed to bring their own pens. So I mentioned

301
00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:22.029
one day the administrative assistant and Professor Smith are walking

302
00:15:22.038 --> 00:15:24.690
by the desk and they just each take a pen

303
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.538
. So the administrative assistant takes a pen just like

304
00:15:26.548 --> 00:15:28.889
she's supposed to. And Professor Smith also takes a

305
00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.090
pen even though she's totally not supposed to and she's

306
00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:35.668
just completely violating this rule. Now, after they've

307
00:15:35.678 --> 00:15:37.928
both done that, um, there's no pens on

308
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.548
the desk. And so when the receptionist gets a

309
00:15:39.558 --> 00:15:41.739
call, she has a problem, she has no

310
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.750
pen to like, take down the message to know

311
00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:48.239
who caused the problem. In that case, participants

312
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.899
overwhelmingly to say that the recept that the Professor Smith

313
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.519
caused the problem, but the administrative assistant did not

314
00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:56.690
cause the problem. And then in that case,

315
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.979
they're making a causal judgment. They're just judging whether

316
00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:00.548
one thing caused another, but their judgment about whether

317
00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:03.288
something caused something else seems to be shaped in some

318
00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:07.000
way by their judgments of which things are right or

319
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:10.389
wrong to do. And then over the past few

320
00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.129
years, we've been doing all these different kinds of

321
00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:17.830
research to explain why that's happened and why does that

322
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.418
happen? Well, there are a number of different

323
00:16:19.428 --> 00:16:22.849
theories and um it could turn out that our theory

324
00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:25.668
is wrong, but the theory that we adopt is

325
00:16:25.678 --> 00:16:30.908
that it depends is that people's moral judgments are shaping

326
00:16:30.918 --> 00:16:33.769
which possibilities they think of. So in the case

327
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:37.590
that I just described what happened in the actual world

328
00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:40.190
was that the administrative assistant took a pen and Professor

329
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.599
Smith took a pen. But you could imagine other

330
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:45.529
possibilities, what we call counter factuals. You could

331
00:16:45.538 --> 00:16:48.830
just imagine other things that could have happened. So

332
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.599
one thing you could imagine is the administrative assistant could

333
00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:53.340
have just not taken a pen, even though there

334
00:16:53.349 --> 00:16:56.298
was no reason for her to do that. And

335
00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:57.479
the professor could have taken a pen. And then

336
00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:00.109
in that case, the problem wouldn't have occurred.

337
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.509
But you would tend not to think about that possibility

338
00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.880
because why would the administrative system of not taking that

339
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.739
? And then another possibility you could consider is,

340
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.279
for example, the administrative system takes a pen and

341
00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:12.709
the professor doesn't take a pen. In that case

342
00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:17.208
, also, the problem wouldn't have occurred, but

343
00:17:17.218 --> 00:17:18.928
there's just a much higher probability that you think of

344
00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.489
that possibility, the possibility in which people do what

345
00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:25.900
they're supposed to do. And so we developed this

346
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.848
theory according to that, which is science probabilities to

347
00:17:29.858 --> 00:17:33.118
different thoughts. So if you mentioned different things,

348
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.029
you could possibly think, then there's a probability of

349
00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.088
thinking certain things and a probability of other thinking other

350
00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.608
things and they're different, there are different potential probabilities

351
00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.809
and then the degree to which you end up regarding

352
00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:47.509
certain things as causes can be defined in it mathematically

353
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.608
in terms of those probabilities. So in the case

354
00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:52.068
that I just told you given the exact way it

355
00:17:52.078 --> 00:17:55.568
works because there was a higher probability of thinking about

356
00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:56.809
cases in which the professor doesn't take a pen and

357
00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.910
in the case in which the administrative assistant doesn't take

358
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.029
a pen, you would more say the professor across

359
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.920
the public. Mhm. Uh, so, uh

360
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.170
, we're going to talk more about the work you've

361
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.868
been doing on, uh, how morality and moral

362
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.660
appraisals affect or at least influence how we think.

363
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.900
Uh, but, uh, I, I mean

364
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.209
, let me ask you another question to introduce a

365
00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:26.420
topic that also we sort of related to that.

366
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:32.059
So people have this idea or concept of the true

367
00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:34.368
self. So, what is that? What does

368
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.019
that mean? Exactly. Oh, yeah, it's

369
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:38.719
a, it's a really good question. Try to

370
00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:42.029
understand what it really is. So there's a very

371
00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:45.699
straightforward sense of which it seems like people have it

372
00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.509
though. Like, so for example, um,

373
00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:51.328
suppose that, uh, you are faced with this

374
00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:53.598
conflict, which is that you want to have,

375
00:18:53.608 --> 00:18:56.890
you, you're, um, addicted to heroin and

376
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.430
you want to have some heroin, but also at

377
00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:02.618
the very time you want to get clean and then

378
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.160
there's this conflict between you. Now suppose you end

379
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.400
up yielding to the temptation to do more heroin and

380
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.709
then you abandon the desire to get clean. A

381
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.509
lot of people would think that decision that you did

382
00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:17.250
chose, it doesn't reflect what you really want deep

383
00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:19.739
down inside something like you're betraying your true self.

384
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:22.439
And then by contrast, if you chose the opposite

385
00:19:22.449 --> 00:19:26.180
option, if you said I'm going to, um

386
00:19:26.449 --> 00:19:29.608
, uh, just not do this heroin, I'm

387
00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:30.439
gonna get clean and I get a jug and I

388
00:19:30.449 --> 00:19:33.430
get back with, if you did that, no

389
00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:36.259
one would say you're betraying your true self because deep

390
00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:37.338
down inside what you really wanted to do was to

391
00:19:37.348 --> 00:19:41.949
have no heroin. So in that case, people

392
00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:44.500
have a very clear intuition about which one is the

393
00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:45.618
thing that your true self is calling you to it

394
00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:48.920
. And then there's a much more difficult question,

395
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.068
which is what does that mean? Like what,

396
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.078
what is it that makes us think that one is

397
00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:56.779
the one that's your true self, right? Uh

398
00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.818
And I, and I mean, is it that

399
00:19:59.828 --> 00:20:03.900
there are any universals when it comes to how people

400
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.239
think about the true self? Well, we do

401
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.818
find actually that there's something strikingly systematic that you see

402
00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:14.779
across many different people and many different cultures. And

403
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:17.939
that is that when there's a conflict between two different

404
00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:19.029
things. So part of you is drawn toward one

405
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.000
thing and part of you is drawn to the other

406
00:20:22.219 --> 00:20:25.670
people show a very striking tendency to think that the

407
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.949
one person you really are deep down inside the real

408
00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:32.098
you is the thing that's to the thing that they

409
00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:33.660
think is good. So in the case that I

410
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.549
just described, if you think that during heroin is

411
00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:38.838
bad, you'd be less likely to think that that's

412
00:20:38.848 --> 00:20:41.838
, that your real self. So if different people

413
00:20:41.848 --> 00:20:45.660
have totally opposite views about what is good, then

414
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.719
those different people will have totally opposite views about who

415
00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:52.170
you really are deep down inside. Like if,

416
00:20:52.598 --> 00:20:55.250
if you're caught between A and B and some people

417
00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:56.838
think A is the good thing and some people think

418
00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:57.779
B is the good thing, the people who think

419
00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:00.439
A is the good thing will say deep down inside

420
00:21:00.449 --> 00:21:03.170
the real Ricardo is struggling toward A and the other

421
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.380
people who think B is the good thing will think

422
00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:08.608
deep down in his true self. The real Ricardo

423
00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:11.420
is the thing that's been drawing him to be.

424
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.689
And what about the misanthrope specifically? Do they also

425
00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:22.729
think that the true self is uh is good or

426
00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:26.930
not? Yeah. So some people have this tendency

427
00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:30.640
that they think people are bad. So if you

428
00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.539
just ask them on um explicit questions, like,

429
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:34.009
do you agree with the following statement? You just

430
00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:37.269
can't really trust people, they're gonna do bad stuff

431
00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:41.000
to you, then they say, yeah, people

432
00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.759
are terrible. So now the question is they still

433
00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:45.969
think that the true self is good. So in

434
00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:49.289
um some research that was led by Julian Deres,

435
00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:52.890
we, we looked at that question and what we

436
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.920
did was um we told, told participants about a

437
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.068
story about someone who's caught between two things. So

438
00:21:57.078 --> 00:22:00.449
they have a desire to do the morally good thing

439
00:22:00.459 --> 00:22:00.880
and they have a desire to do the morally bad

440
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.739
thing. And then participants were randomly assigned to one

441
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.390
of two questions. So one question is given that

442
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.459
people are copying these two things. Which one do

443
00:22:11.469 --> 00:22:15.068
you predict they'll actually do if someone's copying these two

444
00:22:15.078 --> 00:22:15.318
things, you know, what do you think he's

445
00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:18.608
gonna do? And then it's pretty unsurprising the people

446
00:22:18.618 --> 00:22:22.219
who are very low in misanthropy say he's gonna do

447
00:22:22.229 --> 00:22:22.539
the good thing. And the people who are high

448
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:25.719
in misanthropy say he's gonna do the bad thing.

449
00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:29.799
But then by contrast, we say, um OK

450
00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:30.759
, there are these two things I'm not asking you

451
00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:33.799
which one he's gonna do. I'm asking you which

452
00:22:33.809 --> 00:22:36.568
one is his true self. Then the people who

453
00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:38.059
are low in misanthropy and the people who are high

454
00:22:38.068 --> 00:22:41.769
in misanthropy both say the true self is the one

455
00:22:41.779 --> 00:22:45.818
drawing him toward what's good. So misanthropes think you're

456
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.469
, they, they still think deep down you're good

457
00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:51.289
. They just think you're not gonna do the thing

458
00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:52.250
that your true self is calling you to do.

459
00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:57.439
But do we know why? That's the case?

460
00:22:57.449 --> 00:23:00.858
I mean, why, even though they still think

461
00:23:00.868 --> 00:23:03.719
that the true self is good, uh they don't

462
00:23:03.729 --> 00:23:07.479
expect that people will behave in a good way.

463
00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:11.479
Why is that? That's really fascinating question. And

464
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.769
it really gets to a deep question of what this

465
00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:18.630
thing even is like, what, what is it

466
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.229
to say that someone has a true self. It

467
00:23:21.239 --> 00:23:23.500
doesn't seem to be something that we're using to predict

468
00:23:23.509 --> 00:23:26.969
what they're actually going to do. It seems to

469
00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:30.160
be something else. I think maybe this won't answer

470
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.140
your question, but maybe just to give a sense

471
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.199
of what this judgment is, it would be helpful

472
00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:37.519
to give an example one of our studies. So

473
00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:38.709
this is a study that was led by George Newman

474
00:23:38.979 --> 00:23:41.328
. And in this study, participants were told about

475
00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:45.509
this guy Mark and there were two different conditions in

476
00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:49.328
one condition. Participants were told Mark as an evangelical

477
00:23:49.338 --> 00:23:52.059
preacher and he travels around the world brings people this

478
00:23:52.068 --> 00:23:56.890
message that homosexuality is a sin and you can be

479
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.410
redeemed from that sin through the power of Jesus.

480
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.858
If you pray, you can like rid yourself of

481
00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:04.219
homosexuality. And then marcus' problem, which is that

482
00:24:04.229 --> 00:24:07.199
he himself is actually gay. And so he himself

483
00:24:07.209 --> 00:24:10.500
is really drawn to other men. And then he

484
00:24:10.509 --> 00:24:11.719
describes this in his speeches and acknowledges it as part

485
00:24:11.729 --> 00:24:15.920
of his own personal struggle. So there's a struggle

486
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.920
within Mark. Um He has desire to be with

487
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.578
other man and he's a belief that it's morally wrong

488
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.279
. So which part is his true self? In

489
00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:26.880
that case, I just described liberal participants to tend

490
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.180
to say Marx, true yourself is the part that

491
00:24:30.189 --> 00:24:33.368
um is being drawn to other men. And the

492
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.140
conservatives tend to say Mars yourself is the part that

493
00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.939
believes that it's morally wrong. I know if you

494
00:24:37.959 --> 00:24:40.699
can kind of feel that intuitively. But now suppose

495
00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:42.279
we switch it. So now we're gonna say America

496
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:45.640
is this person who travels all around the world,

497
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.229
bringing to people this message that people of all sexual

498
00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:52.630
orientations should be treated equally. And then he teaches

499
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.160
people techniques that they can use to treat gay people

500
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.328
with respect. But Mark himself has a problem and

501
00:24:59.338 --> 00:25:02.380
the problem is that he himself finds himself feeling disgusted

502
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.279
by gay people. And then he acknowledges this fully

503
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:07.979
and just recognized it as a part of his own

504
00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:11.269
personal struggle. So now again, his emotions and

505
00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.189
his moral beliefs are are out of um fighting against

506
00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:15.019
each other, but now in the opposite direction.

507
00:25:15.969 --> 00:25:18.189
So this time, which do people think it's,

508
00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:21.809
is his true self? Here, it's reversed.

509
00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:23.469
The liberals tend to say is more a belief that

510
00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:26.239
you should treat people with all sexual orientations equally.

511
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.769
That's his true self. If you could just get

512
00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:30.939
rid of this disgust, then he'd be able to

513
00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:33.130
more fully express the person, he was all alone

514
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.959
. And then the conservatives tend to say that emotion

515
00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:38.009
of disgust, that is his true self. And

516
00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:40.469
if you could get rid of the moral belief,

517
00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:41.209
then you'd be able to express the person he really

518
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:45.029
is all about. So now we face this question

519
00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:45.739
, which is the question that you just posed,

520
00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:48.180
you know, how do we make sense of what

521
00:25:48.189 --> 00:25:52.500
this thing is? It doesn't seem to be something

522
00:25:52.509 --> 00:25:53.500
that people are using to predict what Mark is going

523
00:25:53.509 --> 00:25:56.049
to do. It seems to be playing some other

524
00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:59.049
role in their way of thinking about who Mark really

525
00:25:59.059 --> 00:26:04.059
is. But then, uh, people's own moral

526
00:26:04.068 --> 00:26:10.650
values influence how they think about the true self.

527
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.368
And what they say is the true self of someone

528
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:21.000
they are evaluating. Yeah, exactly. And people's

529
00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:23.479
moral beliefs affect that and then it doesn't seem to

530
00:26:23.489 --> 00:26:26.368
be that they only affects judgments about the true self

531
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.250
, let's say of a human being, they seem

532
00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:30.750
to also affect judgments about the essence of other things

533
00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:33.640
other than human beings. So say, there's some

534
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.118
band you like and now suppose the band has different

535
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.729
albums over time. See, their first album was

536
00:26:40.739 --> 00:26:44.140
really amazing. And then by the third album they've

537
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.910
, like, totally sold out and then the,

538
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.068
the band is just like, doing some, like

539
00:26:48.078 --> 00:26:52.709
, corporate schlock to sell more records. Yeah.

540
00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:55.059
I thought you could ask the question, like all

541
00:26:55.068 --> 00:26:57.509
those different albums, which one reflects, like what

542
00:26:57.519 --> 00:27:00.640
this band is really all about. Like the true

543
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.410
essence of this band. Then you get the same

544
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.328
effect that people say, whichever is the best one

545
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.170
that's what affects like the real essence of the band

546
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.858
. No one ever thinks, um, the schlocky

547
00:27:11.868 --> 00:27:15.989
corporate stuff. That's what the band was really all

548
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.130
about. And then they were betraying their true essence

549
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.729
in their first album when they created this amazing music

550
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.000
, we're supposed to think about the essence of the

551
00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:26.699
United States. So the United States has done various

552
00:27:26.709 --> 00:27:29.809
different things. For example, there's maybe a lot

553
00:27:29.818 --> 00:27:32.318
of freedom, but there's also a lot of racism

554
00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:33.459
. And then you might ask the question, you

555
00:27:33.469 --> 00:27:36.549
know, what's the real essence of the United States

556
00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:37.989
? What's the United States really all about? And

557
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.078
then different people have different views about which things about

558
00:27:41.088 --> 00:27:41.858
the United States are the good ones and which are

559
00:27:41.868 --> 00:27:45.479
the bad ones. But people seem to think whichever

560
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:48.969
is the good thing about the United States. That's

561
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:51.699
what the United States is really all about. So

562
00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:53.338
this thing that we see for judgments about the true

563
00:27:53.348 --> 00:27:56.489
self, it seems like it arises for judgments about

564
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.719
the self, arises for like what you are really

565
00:27:59.729 --> 00:28:02.140
all about, but not just because you're because of

566
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.420
you, because you're a human being, it also

567
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.900
arises for nations, for bands, for all sorts

568
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.789
of different things. Like if I write a philosophy

569
00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:14.368
paper and it has different sections and some are good

570
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.979
and some are bad, whichever section you think is

571
00:28:15.989 --> 00:28:18.420
the good one, you'll think that's the real heart

572
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.818
of what my paper is really all about. And

573
00:28:22.828 --> 00:28:25.750
, uh, I mean, I asked you if

574
00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:29.939
uh moral beliefs influence the way people think about the

575
00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:33.509
true self of a particular somebody. So, but

576
00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:36.900
uh, does it work also the other way around

577
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.640
? I mean, do beliefs about the true self

578
00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:44.309
influence moral judgment. That's a great question. We

579
00:28:45.189 --> 00:28:48.380
, we have some evidence in recent work with Michael

580
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.118
printing that seems to suggest that, that they do

581
00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:53.469
. So, the basic idea would be, um

582
00:28:53.809 --> 00:28:57.759
, suppose, for example, that, um someone

583
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.410
is, um, he's caught between two different kind

584
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.670
of romantic interests like a woman is trying to choose

585
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.348
between two different men. And then suppose you learn

586
00:29:07.689 --> 00:29:10.660
, she's drawn to one and she's also drawn to

587
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.689
the other, but deep down in her truest heart

588
00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:15.598
, she's more drawn to this one and less to

589
00:29:15.608 --> 00:29:18.779
that one that makes people think that this one is

590
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:22.880
actually the good person that people think the thing that

591
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.910
your true self is drawing you toward. Probably that

592
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.289
thing is good. And it feels like a,

593
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.180
like a really fundamental kind of heuristic that people use

594
00:29:36.189 --> 00:29:38.598
sometimes in their own decision making that, that when

595
00:29:38.608 --> 00:29:41.250
they're trying to figure out what's right, they seem

596
00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:45.150
to be drawn to the thought that whatever their truest

597
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.650
deepest self is pulling them toward, that must really

598
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.719
be the right thing. Mhm. And I mean

599
00:29:52.729 --> 00:29:59.328
, do judgments moral judgments regarding uh the goodness or

600
00:29:59.338 --> 00:30:03.868
the badness of someone's behavior, have any influence in

601
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.140
how we think about them being happy or not,

602
00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.189
or if they deserve praise or blame, that is

603
00:30:12.199 --> 00:30:18.289
uh thinking about a particular agent's behavior in moral terms

604
00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:21.759
, also influence how we think about it in terms

605
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:26.939
of some other psychological dimensions like happiness, praise blame

606
00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:30.358
. And so on, we, we get these

607
00:30:30.368 --> 00:30:33.049
very strong effects for happiness. So an obvious thought

608
00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:34.979
you might have about what it is to be happy

609
00:30:34.989 --> 00:30:37.709
. Is it being happy? It just means feeling

610
00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:41.118
really good all the time, not feeling bad.

611
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.858
And I don't know, thinking your life is going

612
00:30:41.868 --> 00:30:45.140
well, this is about his mental states that you

613
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.368
have. But for some reason, we're finding that

614
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:52.140
people's moral judgments affect whether you see someone's happy or

615
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.680
not. So imagine two different cases. So imagine

616
00:30:56.479 --> 00:30:57.500
this person who feels really good all the time,

617
00:30:57.509 --> 00:31:00.618
doesn't feel bad and thinks her life is going great

618
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.328
. And the reason is she's like a high school

619
00:31:03.338 --> 00:31:07.338
student who is um really uh has close friends in

620
00:31:07.348 --> 00:31:10.180
her high school and is like working to help the

621
00:31:10.189 --> 00:31:11.598
disadvantaged, like on her spare time and it's a

622
00:31:11.608 --> 00:31:15.098
good relationship with her parents and so forth. Then

623
00:31:15.108 --> 00:31:18.430
people think she's truly happy but not consider a different

624
00:31:18.439 --> 00:31:21.098
person I met with someone who's more like Regina George

625
00:31:21.108 --> 00:31:23.380
, the character from mean girls. So she feels

626
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.309
really good and she doesn't feel bad and she thinks

627
00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:27.279
her life is going great. And the reason is

628
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:30.130
because she's the most popular kid in the class.

629
00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:33.318
And whenever anyone else tries to challenge her or something

630
00:31:33.328 --> 00:31:37.088
, she just like insults them and demeans them and

631
00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:40.430
just dominates everyone. She has no real friends,

632
00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:42.299
no real interests doesn't really care about anything. And

633
00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:45.410
it's just trying to like, get to the top

634
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.509
of this popularity contest, then people feel when you

635
00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:51.900
give that case a little, I much more torn

636
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.709
about whether the person is happy. So a lot

637
00:31:52.719 --> 00:31:55.549
of people seem to have this feeling like, well

638
00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.170
, there's clearly a sense in which she's happy.

639
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.828
You just said she feels good. But on the

640
00:31:59.838 --> 00:32:00.449
other hand, they feel like no, but there's

641
00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:02.539
some deeper sense of when she doesn't feel happy at

642
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:05.769
all in some sense, what she has is not

643
00:32:05.779 --> 00:32:08.930
true happiness where true happiness seems to be something that

644
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.759
you can laugh even if you're feeling pretty great.

645
00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:16.729
Uh But uh I mean, when it comes to

646
00:32:16.739 --> 00:32:22.759
happiness, this is, I guess a complicated concept

647
00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:25.838
, isn't it the case that conceptions of happiness vary

648
00:32:25.848 --> 00:32:30.910
cross culturally. We don't find that in the studies

649
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.269
that we've done. So you work with Yang,

650
00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:37.410
we um why we and she translated all of this

651
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.969
into Chinese and then just ran all these cases in

652
00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:45.328
um in China with Chinese people. And then we

653
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:49.848
find exactly the same thing arising that people say the

654
00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:52.410
person who's morally bad isn't really happy. And then

655
00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:58.098
, and then tried it with Children. So um

656
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.500
if you imagine like just asking the same kind of

657
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:02.500
question to a four year old, and then we

658
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:06.009
find again the same thing, Children also show the

659
00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:08.269
same effect. So overall, it seems like what

660
00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:12.769
, what's going on is that this effect seems to

661
00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:15.930
be not something that's just arising I don't know because

662
00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:17.769
of certain weird idiosyncrasies of what's going on in western

663
00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:21.358
culture, in the 20 twenties. It's something that

664
00:33:22.229 --> 00:33:24.019
is in very young Children before they've had the chance

665
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:27.219
to kind of learn all the subtleties of exactly how

666
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:29.920
words are used. And it's something that arises across

667
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.239
very different cultures. It's a very good question why

668
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.229
it's happening, but it doesn't seem to be happening

669
00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:38.019
because it's something more like about, um kind of

670
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:42.380
just uh certain books we happen to have read or

671
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.489
certain ways we happen to use this one word.

672
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.739
Uh And I, I would like to ask you

673
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.578
now about uh folk morality. Do, do people

674
00:33:52.588 --> 00:33:57.509
, for example, tend to believe in objective moral

675
00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:00.568
truths? Yeah, that's a great question. So

676
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:04.489
in, in philosophy, there's been a really long

677
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.148
and profound question uh inquiry into the question are their

678
00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:12.148
moral truths objective? Could there really be a fact

679
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.708
of the matter about some moral question? And within

680
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:15.840
philosophy, there's some people who think the answer is

681
00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:17.789
yes and some people who think the answer is no

682
00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.188
. But typically people on both sides of that dispute

683
00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.000
say that ordinary folks think the answer is definitely yes

684
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.909
. So the people who say that the answer is

685
00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:30.250
yes, they were defending the ordinary view and the

686
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.869
people who say the answer is no, say the

687
00:34:31.878 --> 00:34:35.378
ordinary view is wrong. There aren't objective well truths

688
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.608
in the way people think they ordinarily are. But

689
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:39.579
why do people say that just try asking a few

690
00:34:39.588 --> 00:34:44.298
people around you. And you'll find immediately that people

691
00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:46.927
don't always say that their objective moral is pe different

692
00:34:46.938 --> 00:34:50.539
people you ask will give you different answers and different

693
00:34:50.548 --> 00:34:52.278
questions, the ways of asking the question will give

694
00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:55.197
you different answers. It seems like what's happening and

695
00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:57.588
you could see this. I think immediately if you

696
00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:00.867
just asked a few friends is that people regard this

697
00:35:00.878 --> 00:35:04.769
as a confusing question that they think it's a difficult

698
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.708
question to answer and they're kind of drawn in competing

699
00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:09.878
directions. So we ran a whole series of studies

700
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.208
and that's what they seem to show that um people

701
00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:15.978
are confused about this. It's like difficult and de

702
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:17.869
depending on various things that you do, you can

703
00:35:17.878 --> 00:35:22.309
kind of push people in very different directions. But

704
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.128
uh I, I mean, o of course,

705
00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:28.199
I don't know if you controlled for these in those

706
00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:32.188
studies but uh the way people think about morality and

707
00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:36.938
moral proofs as being objective or not, this,

708
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:39.070
is it influence or do you know if it's influenced

709
00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:45.708
in any way by uh political beliefs? For example

710
00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:46.989
, I mean, beca because the there's this,

711
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.280
sometimes we hear this idea that uh conservative people when

712
00:35:53.289 --> 00:36:00.458
compared to liberal people would believe more in objective moral

713
00:36:00.469 --> 00:36:04.159
truths. But I, I don't know if that

714
00:36:04.168 --> 00:36:08.978
has any scientific or experimental philosophical support to it or

715
00:36:08.989 --> 00:36:12.780
not. Yeah, that is true. So in

716
00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:14.949
studies by this is not my own work. But

717
00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:17.360
in studies by Louis SS, he finds this correlation

718
00:36:17.688 --> 00:36:22.300
that more conservative people more believe in objective moral truths

719
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:25.599
and more liberal people less believe in objective moral truths

720
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:30.599
. So that's just a correlation. It doesn't mean

721
00:36:30.898 --> 00:36:34.699
that the political beliefs are affecting the, um,

722
00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:37.519
the beliefs about the nature of normality. It could

723
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.599
be a different way where there's some deeper fact about

724
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.619
a person and that affects your political beliefs and it

725
00:36:42.628 --> 00:36:45.530
also just affects your beliefs about morality. But in

726
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.438
any case, you're totally right, though different people

727
00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:51.458
with different political beliefs tend to have different beliefs about

728
00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:54.289
whether they're objective morals. Uh, and so,

729
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.489
but when it comes to moral relativism, do we

730
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.239
have any idea about how prevalent it is among people

731
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.079
and, uh, across different cultures? I mean

732
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.570
, is it that it's very common or not?

733
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.860
Yes. So in studies to address this question,

734
00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:17.539
we try, um, uh, to test whether

735
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.849
people are moral relatives by giving them the, the

736
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.750
following kind of cases. So they're gonna be three

737
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.188
different conditions. And so imagine there's some person in

738
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:28.659
, I don't know, New Jersey and this person

739
00:37:28.668 --> 00:37:30.478
does something like, for example, he murders his

740
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:35.648
own child. And now suppose that you say that

741
00:37:35.659 --> 00:37:37.039
what he did was morally wrong. And then I

742
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.320
say what he did is totally fine. And then

743
00:37:39.329 --> 00:37:43.239
participants are asked the question given that Ricardo and Josh

744
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.059
said, opposite things about this does one of them

745
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.949
have to be wrong, Ricardo or Josh or could

746
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:49.929
it be that neither of them is wrong? And

747
00:37:49.938 --> 00:37:52.090
then in that case, participants overwhelmingly say one of

748
00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:54.398
us has to be wrong. Ok. Now consider

749
00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:58.449
a different case, suppose there's discrepancies in New Jersey

750
00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:01.418
, then he murders his own child. And then

751
00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:05.659
I say that, um, what that, what

752
00:38:05.668 --> 00:38:07.679
he did is morally wrong. And then there's someone

753
00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:08.699
else in a completely different culture, say this is

754
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:12.469
the hunter gatherer living in the Amazon. And then

755
00:38:12.478 --> 00:38:15.188
that person says what this person did isn't wrong at

756
00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:17.079
all. It's totally fine. Then given that I

757
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.809
said this thing and this other person from his other

758
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.978
cultures said the opposite. Does one of us have

759
00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:22.458
to be wrong? Or could we both be right

760
00:38:23.389 --> 00:38:25.489
on that case, people are right about at the

761
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.648
midpoint of the scale. So in that case,

762
00:38:30.128 --> 00:38:31.898
participants don't say definitely one of you has to be

763
00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:35.969
wrong or definitely could be that you're neither of you

764
00:38:35.978 --> 00:38:37.659
is wrong. They're kind of like neither here nor

765
00:38:37.668 --> 00:38:39.320
there. Now consider a third condition. That's like

766
00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:44.179
an even more distinct culture. So ma that there

767
00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:46.708
are these extraterrestrial beings, they're called the PS and

768
00:38:46.869 --> 00:38:49.610
the P tars don't have any of the interest that

769
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:51.090
we have. They're not, they don't care about

770
00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:54.128
like love and friendship and like um helping others.

771
00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:57.550
None of that, all they care about is maximizing

772
00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:00.208
the total number of Pentagons in the universe. And

773
00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:00.969
then, for example, if one of them becomes

774
00:39:00.978 --> 00:39:05.070
too old and tired and sick to accomplish this task

775
00:39:05.148 --> 00:39:06.829
, they just kill that and just turn him into

776
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.280
a Pentagon and then none of them see anything wrong

777
00:39:08.289 --> 00:39:12.079
with that. No, I mentioned that this person

778
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.550
in New Jersey kills his own child and I say

779
00:39:14.559 --> 00:39:15.829
that's really morally bad. And one of the panthers

780
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.489
says, no, it's totally fine. There's nothing

781
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.269
bad about it at all. Then in that case

782
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.679
, does one of us have to be wrong me

783
00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:23.760
or the Panther or could it be that neither of

784
00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:25.969
us is wrong in that kind of case, participants

785
00:39:25.978 --> 00:39:29.019
tend to say neither of you has to be wrong

786
00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.070
. So it's a little bit unclear what to make

787
00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:35.860
of this and different um philosophers have had very different

788
00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:37.208
thoughts about it, but it seems to at least

789
00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:42.579
suggest there, there's something that draws us toward thinking

790
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:45.438
in a relativist way as we start thinking about um

791
00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:49.148
judges who are more and more different from each other

792
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.320
. Mhm. Uh So it seems that also that

793
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:58.989
uh people consistently make sense of moral events in terms

794
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.938
of agents and patients do, do we know why

795
00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:07.699
? That's the case? So right there, there's

796
00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:09.110
really important work, not, not by me,

797
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.628
that's indicating it a really fundamental aspect of how people

798
00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:15.570
think about moral situations is that there is kind of

799
00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:21.039
true rules, there's the role of the agent and

800
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.199
the role of the patient So I don't know if

801
00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:30.329
um if the Russian army killed some innocent people in

802
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.840
a Ukrainian town, then the Russian army would be

803
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:34.550
the agent and the innocent people who got killed will

804
00:40:34.559 --> 00:40:37.860
be the patient. And then uh research on this

805
00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:40.510
topic has explored these two rules, these fundamental rules

806
00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:44.760
and morality and uh how things like that work.

807
00:40:44.769 --> 00:40:46.398
Like, for example, some research seems to suggest

808
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.889
that it's very hard to see someone as occupying bulls

809
00:40:49.898 --> 00:40:51.829
ws like in two different events. They, they

810
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.289
would be hard in the case. I just described

811
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.869
to think that for example, the um people would

812
00:40:55.878 --> 00:40:59.780
tend not to think that those people were the victims

813
00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:00.780
of the Russian army, but also they themselves are

814
00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:05.228
perpetrators who harm other people within their towns, right

815
00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:07.969
? So then the question arises, why does morality

816
00:41:07.978 --> 00:41:09.659
work like that? Why do we have these two

817
00:41:09.668 --> 00:41:14.320
fundamental rules? And one possible answer you could give

818
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:15.780
is that it's just because it's something about morality,

819
00:41:15.789 --> 00:41:19.579
morality is like that. But at least what we

820
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.360
suggested was may, maybe it's not, maybe the

821
00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:24.269
reason that things work that way is because it's something

822
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.188
much more general about human cognition, how the human

823
00:41:28.199 --> 00:41:31.438
mind works. There people tend to think about agents

824
00:41:31.449 --> 00:41:35.898
and patients or sometimes they're called agents and themes in

825
00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:38.000
general. And some evidence from that comes from like

826
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:42.760
the structure of human language that if you think about

827
00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:45.679
um which thing goes in the subject position of a

828
00:41:45.688 --> 00:41:46.530
sentence and which thing goes in the object position of

829
00:41:46.539 --> 00:41:50.809
the sentence? It it's, it's not random.

830
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.300
It always seems to be the agent and the patient

831
00:41:52.418 --> 00:41:54.199
. So just to give you a sense of what

832
00:41:54.208 --> 00:41:57.610
I mean, you know how we have the word

833
00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:00.918
, for example. Um Great. So you couldn't

834
00:42:00.929 --> 00:42:04.918
say like I broke his bone and that would mean

835
00:42:04.929 --> 00:42:07.500
like that I was the one who caused the bone

836
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.739
to break or like John broke Fred's bone or we

837
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:13.019
could have like um hurt like John hurt Fred.

838
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.079
But no, I imagine we tried to create a

839
00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.530
verb that's like the reverse of hurt. It's called

840
00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:21.708
a Schmidt. And then John Schmidt uh Fred Schmit

841
00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:23.340
did um John just means the same thing as John

842
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:28.300
hurt. Fred that no language has a word that

843
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:30.059
works like that and you can kind of feel it

844
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:32.840
immediately like that we could never have that, that

845
00:42:32.849 --> 00:42:37.289
verb could never exist. So it feels like there's

846
00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.059
this very basic connection we have uh idea we have

847
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.079
about agency and patient is such that we're always gonna

848
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.958
put the agent and subject position and the patient or

849
00:42:45.969 --> 00:42:49.550
in this is sometimes called the theme in the object

850
00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:53.418
position. Mhm uh And since we're talking here about

851
00:42:53.429 --> 00:42:59.228
uh folk philosophy, what tend to be people's ideas

852
00:42:59.239 --> 00:43:00.820
about free will, I mean, is the belief

853
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:06.148
in free will, a human universal. Well,

854
00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:07.610
it, it, it's really interesting that what you

855
00:43:07.619 --> 00:43:09.769
find if you ask people in the United States about

856
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.840
free, well, like say we just looked around

857
00:43:12.849 --> 00:43:16.929
here is that people find it confusing. So um

858
00:43:16.938 --> 00:43:22.010
if you ask like folks right around here, if

859
00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:23.329
I ask them certain kinds of questions, what I

860
00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.829
get is that people would immediately recognize that that's like

861
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.110
a really confusing question and then they're like torn in

862
00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:31.329
different directions. Some people would say one thing,

863
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.250
some people say another thing, a lot of people

864
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.489
would just openly admit that that's like a really hard

865
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.260
problem. So that like you said about universality,

866
00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:44.438
a really question now is um is is why why

867
00:43:44.449 --> 00:43:47.269
do people find it confusing around here? And when

868
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.148
I was um first starting to work on this issue

869
00:43:51.409 --> 00:43:52.909
, uh what I thought the answer was is that

870
00:43:53.648 --> 00:43:58.590
it's due in part certain very specific kind of talks

871
00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:00.898
about Western culture that make us find it confusing.

872
00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:02.659
But also, I mean, people in Western culture

873
00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:07.148
and then, and then I was totally wrong.

874
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:12.269
So I um started researching this topic with um my

875
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.570
colleague Sean Nichols who had the opposite guess about what

876
00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:16.659
was right? And I just got completely owned it

877
00:44:16.668 --> 00:44:19.969
is in no way. Did that turn out to

878
00:44:19.978 --> 00:44:22.418
be true? What happened instead was that this kind

879
00:44:22.429 --> 00:44:25.019
of intuition that we, these kind of intuitions that

880
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.320
we have in in Western culture that are pulling us

881
00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:30.239
in opposite directions and confusing us and making the question

882
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:35.639
seem like a really puzzling one those arise really universally

883
00:44:36.019 --> 00:44:37.739
. So in in a beautiful recent study where the

884
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:42.260
first author was Ivar Henkin, um participants were recruited

885
00:44:42.269 --> 00:44:45.289
from all different places across the world and given questions

886
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.320
about free will. And if you look at the

887
00:44:46.329 --> 00:44:47.889
Western culture, what you find is that people are

888
00:44:47.898 --> 00:44:50.639
very divided. Some people say one thing, some

889
00:44:50.648 --> 00:44:52.398
people say the other, it's obviously a really confusing

890
00:44:52.409 --> 00:44:55.559
question. And then that exact same confusion arose in

891
00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.438
every world region that they looked at every different continent

892
00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:01.659
showed the same confusion with the same kind of percentage

893
00:45:01.668 --> 00:45:04.539
of people saying one thing and saying the other thing

894
00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:07.949
. So it's really like this feeling we have that

895
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.860
but it's confusing that it's puzzling that there's something going

896
00:45:12.869 --> 00:45:15.349
wrong when we think about free will. It's not

897
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.369
because of something about our weird culture. It's because

898
00:45:20.378 --> 00:45:25.019
of something about human way of understanding action. But

899
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:29.099
I I mean when you mentioned there that uh when

900
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.769
you ask people certain questions, you get the sense

901
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.418
that they are a bit confused about free will.

902
00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:39.360
Could you give us examples of some of those questions

903
00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:42.989
just for us to get a better sense of what

904
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.208
we're talking about here? Absolutely. So in one

905
00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:47.599
of the early studies we did about this, we

906
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.559
were interested in the question, what do people think

907
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.519
when I think about this kind of question abstractly just

908
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.780
like theoretically? And what did you think about this

909
00:45:55.789 --> 00:45:59.219
question? And the thing about individual cases with individual

910
00:45:59.228 --> 00:46:01.269
behaviors. OK. So to address this question,

911
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.559
we told people about this imaginary universe, we called

912
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.519
it universe a and we said like, OK,

913
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.250
imagine in this, this imaginary universe is totally deterministic

914
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.800
. So what that means is everything that happens was

915
00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:15.728
completely caused by the thing that happened before, which

916
00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:16.969
was completely caused by the thing that happened before that

917
00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:19.898
it's clearly caused by the thing that happened before that

918
00:46:19.909 --> 00:46:21.800
all the way back to the very beginning of the

919
00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:23.648
universe. So if you consider how things were,

920
00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:27.128
you know, one second after the universe first began

921
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.378
, that completely caused the thing that would happen next

922
00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:30.418
and next and next. So that given the way

923
00:46:30.429 --> 00:46:32.489
things were at the very beginning of the universe and

924
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.269
given the laws of physics in this universe, you

925
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.168
and I would have to be having this conversation right

926
00:46:37.179 --> 00:46:39.369
now. It could be like in principle predicted from

927
00:46:39.378 --> 00:46:42.099
the 1st, 2nd after the universe we have.

928
00:46:42.909 --> 00:46:44.628
So OK, do you understand this idea of the

929
00:46:44.639 --> 00:46:45.119
universe? All right, people get this. I

930
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:47.929
got. Yeah. And then we said no,

931
00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:52.820
um here's a question and then were split into two

932
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:55.489
conditions in one condition. They got an abstract question

933
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.110
. The abstract question was, can anyone in this

934
00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:01.530
universe ever be morally responsible for anything they ever do

935
00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.300
? And an overwhelmingly participant saying no in this universe

936
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:08.769
that you described universe, a no one can ever

937
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:12.519
be more responsible for anything. It's just not possible

938
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.590
. Determinist the universe. That's what philosophers call incompatible

939
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:20.750
with. It's called incompatible because it's saying moral responsibility

940
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.849
is incompatible with determinism. Then in the other people

941
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.628
got a very different question. It was a concrete

942
00:47:25.639 --> 00:47:29.260
question. So participants, which will imagine one guy

943
00:47:29.269 --> 00:47:31.239
in that universe, a guy in universe a he

944
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.449
falls in love with his secretary and he wants to

945
00:47:34.458 --> 00:47:36.550
like leave his wife and family for a secretary.

946
00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.289
So he sets up an inn device in his basement

947
00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:42.378
that burns down the house and kills his own wife

948
00:47:42.389 --> 00:47:45.610
and Children. Is that guy more than responsible that

949
00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:47.239
guy in universe A is he morally responsible for what

950
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:51.668
he did? And their participants overwhelmingly say yes.

951
00:47:52.329 --> 00:47:55.309
So these are obviously like logically inconsistent participants are saying

952
00:47:57.478 --> 00:47:59.280
in universe A in the abstract, no one can

953
00:47:59.289 --> 00:48:00.309
ever be more responsible for anything they do. But

954
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.449
they're also saying that one guy who was in universe

955
00:48:02.458 --> 00:48:05.898
A is totally more responsible for this one thing that

956
00:48:05.909 --> 00:48:09.559
he did. So, a and since we've been

957
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:15.438
talking about moral judgments and how they affect or influence

958
00:48:15.449 --> 00:48:19.219
, uh thinking about different topics, uh The uh

959
00:48:19.228 --> 00:48:22.550
what uh is it the case that what you just

960
00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:29.418
mentioned there points to uh moral judgment also influencing how

961
00:48:29.429 --> 00:48:30.628
we think about free will. I mean, in

962
00:48:30.639 --> 00:48:35.610
that particular case, uh is, should we conclude

963
00:48:35.619 --> 00:48:39.519
that if people want to blame someone, they tend

964
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:45.708
to attribute free will to their actions? Yeah.

965
00:48:45.719 --> 00:48:46.418
At first I thought that was right. The thing

966
00:48:46.429 --> 00:48:50.320
that you just said and then in, in a

967
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:52.840
really beautiful series of studies, Florent Cage showed that

968
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:57.179
it, it's not right. So there really is

969
00:48:57.188 --> 00:49:00.820
a difference between concrete things and abstract things. So

970
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:06.550
when it's concrete, people think it's due to um

971
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:10.539
to your um uh when it's concrete, they think

972
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:13.269
that you, you're, you're responsible for it and

973
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.708
you do it freely and when it's abstract, I

974
00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:16.239
think you don't, but it's not due to,

975
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.320
for example, you being really upset about the thing

976
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:22.438
the person did and really wanting to blame them.

977
00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:25.159
So for example, if you start dialing down how

978
00:49:25.168 --> 00:49:28.599
bad it is to something that's just kind of like

979
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.159
feels bad in the kind of a technical sense,

980
00:49:30.168 --> 00:49:32.398
but isn't really like something that people would be outraged

981
00:49:32.409 --> 00:49:36.389
by like in my example, people still think the

982
00:49:36.398 --> 00:49:38.360
person is more the responsible and then coal looked at

983
00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:43.539
people who have frontal temporal dementia. And so as

984
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:45.360
a result of this um disorder, they don't feel

985
00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:47.769
angry at people in the same way they normally would

986
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:51.309
in cases like this and those people have been shown

987
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.349
to have very different judgments about certain kinds of matters

988
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.820
. But unless they show the exact same pattern of

989
00:49:55.829 --> 00:50:00.869
judgments. So if things like it's really something about

990
00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:05.329
the concreteness, it's about thinking about an individual,

991
00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.199
human being doing an individual thing and it's not something

992
00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:10.918
about um the rage that you feel against this person

993
00:50:10.929 --> 00:50:15.918
who killed his own Children but OK, whatever it

994
00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:21.909
is behind it, uh we see these occurring cross

995
00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:23.389
culturally. I mean, do people tend to,

996
00:50:23.628 --> 00:50:29.500
when they are presented with abstract or concrete scenarios,

997
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.750
do they tend to think about them in similar ways

998
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:38.789
? Cross culturally. We, we do. Yeah

999
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.559
, it looks like we do. So we do

1000
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:45.269
find in one study that participants in the abstract think

1001
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.780
about these things in, in a similar way cross

1002
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:52.070
culturally. And then we also find in the um

1003
00:50:53.128 --> 00:50:55.519
this isn't, so that was in the um uh

1004
00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:00.128
Sarkissian Nicholson, I did. And then in the

1005
00:51:00.139 --> 00:51:01.878
study that I just mentioned from Heine Kanen, participants

1006
00:51:01.889 --> 00:51:06.159
are given like a little concrete vignette that's designed in

1007
00:51:06.168 --> 00:51:07.909
such a way that, that it's confusing, you

1008
00:51:07.918 --> 00:51:09.773
know, different people say different things in the United

1009
00:51:09.784 --> 00:51:12.715
States. People are very divided, you know,

1010
00:51:12.724 --> 00:51:14.574
half the people say one thing and half the people

1011
00:51:14.583 --> 00:51:15.293
say another thing. And then if you look at

1012
00:51:15.304 --> 00:51:17.103
China, people are also very divided. If you

1013
00:51:17.114 --> 00:51:20.304
look at different countries in Africa, people are also

1014
00:51:20.313 --> 00:51:22.394
very divided there. It feels like that division is

1015
00:51:22.405 --> 00:51:25.344
itself something that's called that we're seeing across many different

1016
00:51:25.353 --> 00:51:30.418
cultures. I find they're quite striking like that.

1017
00:51:30.329 --> 00:51:35.019
If you think about what you might expect to be

1018
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:37.369
the same across cultures, you might think there are

1019
00:51:37.378 --> 00:51:40.489
these things that are really fundamental to just being able

1020
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.148
to survive in our world. Like things like,

1021
00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:46.559
for example, judgments about how it's appropriate to treat

1022
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.289
your own Children or something like that, that you

1023
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.619
could imagine in no culture would people think it's OK

1024
00:51:52.628 --> 00:51:53.840
to do certain terrible things to their Children? And

1025
00:51:53.849 --> 00:51:57.179
that would be a universal thought. What we're seeing

1026
00:51:57.188 --> 00:52:01.340
here is these very obscure seeming like metaphysical questions about

1027
00:52:01.769 --> 00:52:06.519
free will. Judgments on these questions seem to be

1028
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.449
universal. And that, that seems like a really

1029
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.938
puzzling phenomenon that it's the kind of thing you might

1030
00:52:10.949 --> 00:52:14.579
have thought would vary considerably and that there would be

1031
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:16.458
no reason to expect that you kind of be built

1032
00:52:16.469 --> 00:52:20.570
to the nature of our cognition to give similar judgments

1033
00:52:20.579 --> 00:52:24.909
on questions like those. So uh and I mean

1034
00:52:24.978 --> 00:52:30.938
, when it comes to finding these universals, these

1035
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:35.510
human universals, when it comes to philosophical intuitions and

1036
00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:37.949
we're going to get into some more of them,

1037
00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:40.918
we talked about free will here. Uh Do you

1038
00:52:40.929 --> 00:52:44.949
also, are you also interested in trying to understand

1039
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:50.789
where do those universals come from? If for example

1040
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.469
, they are the result of evolution by natural selection

1041
00:52:54.478 --> 00:53:00.349
operating on a cognitive level or some other thing?

1042
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.860
Yeah. A absolutely. So we, we would

1043
00:53:04.869 --> 00:53:07.349
absolutely want to know why these things seem to arise

1044
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.309
across cultures. So maybe it's too much to say

1045
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.530
these things are universal. It's not that we would

1046
00:53:12.539 --> 00:53:14.409
really have evidence for that, you know, from

1047
00:53:14.418 --> 00:53:17.619
any study. But I think that they're surprisingly stable

1048
00:53:19.099 --> 00:53:22.398
and you know, a really difficult question arises as

1049
00:53:22.409 --> 00:53:24.849
to why they would be so stable. So maybe

1050
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.750
it would be helpful to give an example of the

1051
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.599
kind of thing that just feels like super weird and

1052
00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:31.929
kind of like just a very strange quirk, but

1053
00:53:31.938 --> 00:53:36.688
turns out to be surprisingly stable across cultures. So

1054
00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:38.449
this is an effect that was first discovered by um

1055
00:53:38.458 --> 00:53:42.478
Wesley Buck Walter and James Beanie. And then these

1056
00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:45.000
cross cultural studies were done by um mj Kim and

1057
00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:50.030
Yuan, y So what we Lee Buchalter and James

1058
00:53:50.039 --> 00:53:52.458
BB were just interested in when people think, you

1059
00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:53.389
know, something versus just really something, it turns

1060
00:53:53.398 --> 00:53:54.628
out to be true, like in the case that

1061
00:53:54.639 --> 00:53:58.260
I just described before, you know, so they

1062
00:53:58.269 --> 00:54:00.010
had the idea that maybe mortality affects it. So

1063
00:54:00.159 --> 00:54:02.030
here's the kind of study that they ran in one

1064
00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:06.809
condition, someone's the mayor of a town and um

1065
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.188
he gets some uh has a meeting with someone who's

1066
00:54:09.199 --> 00:54:12.648
like, you know, one of his employees and

1067
00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:14.369
the employee says, ok, we've got this new

1068
00:54:14.378 --> 00:54:17.260
policy that we're considering and this new policy is going

1069
00:54:17.269 --> 00:54:20.789
to really increase campaign contributions to you. So you're

1070
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.860
gonna make tons of money and it's also going to

1071
00:54:23.869 --> 00:54:27.360
bring jobs to people from the town. And then

1072
00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:29.079
he says, I don't really care about bringing jobs

1073
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.539
to people in this town. All I want to

1074
00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.208
do is just get as much money as possible for

1075
00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:35.219
myself. So he says, to um sign this

1076
00:54:35.228 --> 00:54:37.800
contract that's going to adopt the policy. So he

1077
00:54:37.809 --> 00:54:39.378
goes in to sign the contract and then as he's

1078
00:54:39.389 --> 00:54:42.570
just about to sign it, the corporation switches it

1079
00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.840
for a completely different contract. So the contract he

1080
00:54:44.849 --> 00:54:45.489
signed is not at all the one that he thought

1081
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.978
he was gonna sign. But then it turned out

1082
00:54:47.989 --> 00:54:50.918
that that other contract, the one he really did

1083
00:54:50.929 --> 00:54:52.280
sign, ends up bringing jobs to people in this

1084
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.469
town. So he believed he would bring jobs to

1085
00:54:54.478 --> 00:54:57.550
people in town and he did bring jobs to the

1086
00:54:57.559 --> 00:54:59.860
people in town. Did he know that he was

1087
00:54:59.869 --> 00:55:01.059
gonna bring jobs to the people in town. In

1088
00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:04.500
that case, most people say no, ok.

1089
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.489
Now consider another case. The assistant comes to the

1090
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.918
mayor and says, we've got this new policy.

1091
00:55:09.079 --> 00:55:10.829
It's gonna make huge amounts of money for you.

1092
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.989
So you'll get all these campaign contributions, but it's

1093
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.110
also gonna cut jobs for people in the town.

1094
00:55:15.199 --> 00:55:17.030
So people in the town are gonna really be hurt

1095
00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:20.148
by this policy. And the they says, I

1096
00:55:20.159 --> 00:55:22.019
don't care about the people in the town. I

1097
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:22.429
know they're gonna cut, you know, it's gonna

1098
00:55:22.438 --> 00:55:24.110
cut their jobs, but I don't care about that

1099
00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:27.039
. Let's just go ahead and, and do this

1100
00:55:27.059 --> 00:55:29.469
. So he goes to sign the contract and then

1101
00:55:29.478 --> 00:55:30.159
the corporation, he's gonna sign the contract to it

1102
00:55:30.168 --> 00:55:34.039
switches out for a different contract. So the one

1103
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.050
he's signing has all different provisions says all different stuff

1104
00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:38.849
. But that other country does end up cutting jobs

1105
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:42.679
to the town. Did he know that he was

1106
00:55:42.688 --> 00:55:44.418
going to cut jobs to people in the town?

1107
00:55:44.969 --> 00:55:47.090
In that case, people say yes, that just

1108
00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:50.719
feels like a really weird, like quirky thing about

1109
00:55:50.728 --> 00:55:53.478
our way of understanding knowledge. And then um Kim

1110
00:55:53.489 --> 00:55:58.128
and um Yuan studied that same thing by translating all

1111
00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:00.219
of these vignettes. I just gave you into Korean

1112
00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:01.369
and Chinese and then running them on Korean and Chinese

1113
00:56:01.378 --> 00:56:06.429
people. And the same thing happens among participants in

1114
00:56:06.438 --> 00:56:09.539
South Korea and China. So why would that be

1115
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:13.059
? It? It feels like this weird thing I

1116
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.228
just told you, it doesn't feel like we would

1117
00:56:15.239 --> 00:56:19.820
have evolved to have that exact quality, this quality

1118
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:22.769
of making knowledge judgments based on morality. It,

1119
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.898
I don't know if it, if it's somehow in

1120
00:56:25.909 --> 00:56:30.119
some way built into us innately, it must be

1121
00:56:30.128 --> 00:56:32.349
that somehow just the side effect or byproduct's of other

1122
00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:36.110
cognitive capacities we have that serve some other use.

1123
00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.820
It's very hard to see what might be going on

1124
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:40.050
here. I feel like it's very puzzling why these

1125
00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:45.070
things we're seeing are happening across different cultures. OK

1126
00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:47.320
. So they could still be the result or a

1127
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:53.039
by-product of certain uh cognitive adaptations, but they are

1128
00:56:53.050 --> 00:57:00.659
not necessarily adaptations themselves or are not necessarily evolved themselves

1129
00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:02.809
. It feels very unlikely in the case that I

1130
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:08.139
just told you that human beings there was selective pressure

1131
00:57:08.989 --> 00:57:12.668
for making knowledge judgments in a way that's infused by

1132
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:15.769
morality. I mean, that one thing doesn't seem

1133
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.610
like it was really being selected for. It could

1134
00:57:17.619 --> 00:57:22.789
be that our judgments about that one thing are the

1135
00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.949
product of these cognitive processes and those processes were selected

1136
00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:29.228
for in some way. But those processes also do

1137
00:57:29.239 --> 00:57:31.510
other things that seems like it could make sense.

1138
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.320
It could be that there's convergent cultural evolution. It's

1139
00:57:37.329 --> 00:57:39.340
a very complex problem to understand why these things are

1140
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:45.030
so stable across cultures. Mhm But uh I asked

1141
00:57:45.039 --> 00:57:49.269
you as an example about uh free will but have

1142
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.360
you or some of your other colleagues in experimental philosophy

1143
00:57:53.449 --> 00:58:00.648
uh studied uh people's philosophical intuitions in general? I

1144
00:58:00.659 --> 00:58:02.840
mean, and if so do they tend to vary

1145
00:58:02.849 --> 00:58:07.148
a lot or are they stable across, for example

1146
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:13.188
, demographic groups and situations? Well, that's a

1147
00:58:13.199 --> 00:58:15.409
wonderful question. So first of all, obviously,

1148
00:58:15.418 --> 00:58:17.639
the answer is that in some ways they're stable and

1149
00:58:17.648 --> 00:58:20.000
in some ways they're different. I mean, we

1150
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:22.320
could have known that before we ran any studies there

1151
00:58:22.329 --> 00:58:25.349
. It's not that there's no differences ever between cultures

1152
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:29.398
on anything and there's no differences I don't know between

1153
00:58:29.409 --> 00:58:31.809
genders on anything. And it's also not that every

1154
00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.719
single thing is totally different between cultures and between genders

1155
00:58:36.369 --> 00:58:38.260
and then different people have different opinions about how to

1156
00:58:38.269 --> 00:58:40.750
understand what, what we actually discovered. I mean

1157
00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:45.260
, given that we found that some things differ and

1158
00:58:45.269 --> 00:58:46.208
some things stay the same. You know, what

1159
00:58:46.219 --> 00:58:49.978
should we be struck by my own opinion? And

1160
00:58:49.989 --> 00:58:51.938
this is certainly a matter of debate. Is that

1161
00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:53.349
what we should really be struck by is just how

1162
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:58.688
similar everything is that it's not that everything stayed the

1163
00:58:58.699 --> 00:59:00.769
same, it's not that everything was different, but

1164
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:06.659
overall things were just amazingly amazingly similar. So just

1165
00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:08.099
to give an example, there was a really nice

1166
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:12.110
paper by Edelberg Thompson and Nus that looked at a

1167
00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:14.898
whole bunch of different things that people thought might differ

1168
00:59:14.909 --> 00:59:20.860
across genders. So these were all um uh effects

1169
00:59:20.878 --> 00:59:22.228
that someone had actually said in existing literature. I

1170
00:59:22.239 --> 00:59:25.139
said this is going to differ between men and women

1171
00:59:25.809 --> 00:59:28.510
. And then for all of them, I think

1172
00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:31.349
it was maybe 21 different things or 18 different things

1173
00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.969
. Some of them like that, that they checked

1174
00:59:32.978 --> 00:59:37.478
whether there was a difference and it's not that they

1175
00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:39.579
found no differences, it's that they found one difference

1176
00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:45.418
. So approximately what they found is one intuitions on

1177
00:59:45.429 --> 00:59:47.309
one thing did differ between men and women and on

1178
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:50.369
the other, you know, around 19, all

1179
00:59:50.378 --> 00:59:53.389
of those were the same. So that doesn't mean

1180
00:59:53.398 --> 00:59:55.590
there are no differences, there are differences. But

1181
00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:59.219
overall, the message seems to be, these things

1182
00:59:59.228 --> 00:60:02.409
are really, really similar. And then I feel

1183
00:60:02.418 --> 00:60:07.438
like what, what we're seeing especially is um if

1184
00:60:07.449 --> 00:60:12.168
you consider certain kinds of um moral judgments, for

1185
00:60:12.179 --> 00:60:15.159
example, or judgments about religious things are, are

1186
00:60:15.168 --> 00:60:17.309
explicitly transmitted to people. Like people, like your

1187
00:60:17.320 --> 00:60:22.389
parents tell you about morality. Yeah. Then obviously

1188
00:60:22.398 --> 00:60:24.648
we get cross cultural differences on those things. So

1189
00:60:24.889 --> 00:60:28.289
. Mhm. So, if you grew up in

1190
00:60:28.300 --> 00:60:30.030
Iowa or you grew up in Brazil, you're gonna

1191
00:60:30.039 --> 00:60:32.570
have different judgments about morality and it's really obvious why

1192
00:60:32.579 --> 00:60:35.449
it's like, people are just explicitly telling you about

1193
00:60:35.458 --> 00:60:38.769
morality. But most things that philosophers study are things

1194
00:60:38.780 --> 00:60:40.639
that no one ever tells you about. Like when

1195
00:60:40.648 --> 00:60:44.039
you're growing up, no one ever says, you

1196
00:60:44.050 --> 00:60:45.438
know, I just really want you to understand that

1197
00:60:46.168 --> 00:60:50.610
whether someone has knowledge depends in part on whether something

1198
00:60:50.619 --> 00:60:52.708
is morally good or morally bad. Like then you

1199
00:60:52.719 --> 00:60:53.418
just kind of pick stuff up but no one ever

1200
00:60:53.429 --> 00:60:57.019
talks about it and on those things, the things

1201
00:60:57.030 --> 00:60:59.570
that no one ever talks about, we really seem

1202
00:60:59.579 --> 00:61:05.610
to be getting amazing degrees of sonari. Yeah,

1203
00:61:05.619 --> 00:61:07.500
that, that's very interesting. And I, and

1204
00:61:07.510 --> 00:61:10.070
I mean, another interesting question, I guess about

1205
00:61:10.079 --> 00:61:13.688
all of these that we've been talk about we've been

1206
00:61:13.699 --> 00:61:19.219
talking about is so this is about folk philosophy.

1207
00:61:19.228 --> 00:61:22.809
But I mean, philosophers themselves are also people.

1208
00:61:22.820 --> 00:61:27.070
So I mean, when it comes to uh the

1209
00:61:27.079 --> 00:61:31.083
variation, specifically, the variation we find across different

1210
00:61:31.094 --> 00:61:35.934
groups of people, do you think that by having

1211
00:61:35.945 --> 00:61:40.514
an understanding of what's behind that variation, we could

1212
00:61:40.523 --> 00:61:47.204
also have a better understanding of why professional philosophers differ

1213
00:61:47.215 --> 00:61:52.083
in their views of different philosophical topics? You mean

1214
00:61:52.094 --> 00:61:54.853
why different philosophers have different views, maybe we can

1215
00:61:54.894 --> 00:61:59.030
understand it. Yeah, that's a great question.

1216
00:61:59.039 --> 00:62:01.030
So, um the, the first answer is,

1217
00:62:01.039 --> 00:62:02.360
I, I don't know, I don't know the

1218
00:62:02.369 --> 00:62:06.938
answer to the question. And then, um there

1219
00:62:06.949 --> 00:62:08.610
, there has been some research that tries to get

1220
00:62:08.619 --> 00:62:13.869
out why different philosophers have different views and whether it

1221
00:62:13.878 --> 00:62:16.340
has to do with differences between the, the different

1222
00:62:16.349 --> 00:62:20.539
philosophers and then I'll just talk a little bit about

1223
00:62:20.550 --> 00:62:23.449
what has been found. So, in a really

1224
00:62:23.458 --> 00:62:27.070
nice study by Yaden, the result was that one

1225
00:62:27.079 --> 00:62:30.378
result was that demographic factors don't predict it. So

1226
00:62:30.760 --> 00:62:32.800
different philosophers think different stuff. I don't know about

1227
00:62:32.809 --> 00:62:36.239
free will, about whether morality is objective and so

1228
00:62:36.250 --> 00:62:37.639
forth. And then different philosophers are, you know

1229
00:62:37.648 --> 00:62:42.519
, themselves from, from different cultures. And so

1230
00:62:42.530 --> 00:62:44.289
some are men, some are women, some are

1231
00:62:44.300 --> 00:62:47.250
non-binary like that doesn't predict their judgments. Then a

1232
00:62:47.260 --> 00:62:51.739
separate question was for example, whether facts but their

1233
00:62:51.750 --> 00:62:54.559
personalities affect their, their judgments about these things.

1234
00:62:54.739 --> 00:62:59.579
And overall, I would say um in the study

1235
00:62:59.590 --> 00:63:04.300
of philosophers, they mostly didn't. So, so

1236
00:63:04.478 --> 00:63:07.378
facts about like what kind of person you are have

1237
00:63:07.389 --> 00:63:08.878
overall, I would say very little impact on,

1238
00:63:09.289 --> 00:63:14.128
on what your philosophical views were but not exclusively.

1239
00:63:14.219 --> 00:63:16.869
So for example, if you ask professional philosophers,

1240
00:63:16.929 --> 00:63:21.139
whether they do drugs, so do you use recreational

1241
00:63:21.148 --> 00:63:22.739
drugs? And then you ask them, are there

1242
00:63:22.750 --> 00:63:25.570
objective truths about art like which art is better and

1243
00:63:25.579 --> 00:63:29.269
which art is worse? Those two things are correlated

1244
00:63:29.280 --> 00:63:30.148
. So the more drugs you use, the less

1245
00:63:30.159 --> 00:63:32.809
you think there is like objective truths about art and

1246
00:63:32.820 --> 00:63:36.780
that seems to be totally real. So there is

1247
00:63:36.789 --> 00:63:38.329
no, in just in that case, for example

1248
00:63:38.340 --> 00:63:43.409
, certain kinds of correlations between your personality or the

1249
00:63:43.418 --> 00:63:45.659
kind of life you're living in your philosophical. And

1250
00:63:45.719 --> 00:63:49.579
then in a series of studies that feel really funny

1251
00:63:49.590 --> 00:63:52.760
to me, Nick Bird was looking at um the

1252
00:63:52.769 --> 00:63:58.179
relationship between uh like being reflective in the sense that

1253
00:63:58.188 --> 00:64:00.148
for example, you can solve certain logical problems correctly

1254
00:64:00.409 --> 00:64:04.239
and um and having certain answers to philosophical questions,

1255
00:64:04.250 --> 00:64:06.139
but then this might not seem very surprising. But

1256
00:64:06.418 --> 00:64:09.530
um if you ask ordinary folks say, you,

1257
00:64:09.539 --> 00:64:12.438
you just go into like a classroom and you give

1258
00:64:12.449 --> 00:64:14.639
everyone like a bunch of logic puzzles and you can

1259
00:64:14.648 --> 00:64:15.760
see who's better, who gets the best right answer

1260
00:64:15.769 --> 00:64:18.579
and who gets the wrong answer. Then what you

1261
00:64:18.590 --> 00:64:23.760
find is that um that predicts uh judgments about certain

1262
00:64:23.769 --> 00:64:26.789
philosophical questions. So just as an example, um

1263
00:64:27.119 --> 00:64:28.760
in the case that I gave you earlier where I

1264
00:64:28.769 --> 00:64:32.070
was seeing like um imagine that this person who kills

1265
00:64:32.079 --> 00:64:34.898
his wife and family, the, the more you

1266
00:64:34.909 --> 00:64:36.889
um get logic, right, the more you think

1267
00:64:36.898 --> 00:64:40.329
he's not more responsible for what he did. OK

1268
00:64:40.340 --> 00:64:42.429
. So this is the weird thing that Bird discovered

1269
00:64:42.789 --> 00:64:45.300
if you know, run it on philosophers. So

1270
00:64:45.309 --> 00:64:48.369
you're running it on or philosophy professors. It still

1271
00:64:48.378 --> 00:64:51.860
happens that the philosophy professors who get the logic problems

1272
00:64:51.869 --> 00:64:54.938
, right? Tend to have different answers than the

1273
00:64:54.949 --> 00:64:59.030
philosophy professors who don't. So that feels like a

1274
00:64:59.039 --> 00:65:01.168
very strange fact. But he did find it.

1275
00:65:01.780 --> 00:65:05.050
I, I think that the, the, the

1276
00:65:05.059 --> 00:65:09.429
broader answer to your question is that I, I

1277
00:65:09.438 --> 00:65:14.168
think as a philosopher, when I consider these questions

1278
00:65:14.179 --> 00:65:15.418
, like the age old questions of philosophy that people

1279
00:65:15.429 --> 00:65:18.369
have been discussing for thousands of years, I feel

1280
00:65:18.378 --> 00:65:20.909
torn, like I feel drawn in one direction and

1281
00:65:20.918 --> 00:65:23.878
drawn in another. And then eventually I might make

1282
00:65:23.889 --> 00:65:25.250
up my mind like maybe I'm torn. But I

1283
00:65:25.260 --> 00:65:28.530
decided on this. I think one question you could

1284
00:65:28.539 --> 00:65:30.639
ask is do these theories explain why I eventually decided

1285
00:65:30.648 --> 00:65:32.849
on this? And someone else decides on that another

1286
00:65:32.860 --> 00:65:34.659
question you ask, you could ask is do these

1287
00:65:34.668 --> 00:65:36.800
theories explain why both of us are torn in the

1288
00:65:36.809 --> 00:65:40.820
first place? I think it's definitely the second,

1289
00:65:40.829 --> 00:65:45.489
but at the very least we're really getting some explanation

1290
00:65:45.510 --> 00:65:48.679
of, of why people feel confused, if not

1291
00:65:48.688 --> 00:65:51.000
an explanation of why different people resolve the confusion in

1292
00:65:51.010 --> 00:65:55.239
different ways. Mhm But I mean, do you

1293
00:65:55.250 --> 00:66:00.840
think we should at least expect that individual differences in

1294
00:66:00.849 --> 00:66:06.438
cognition wherever they stem from, would have an impact

1295
00:66:06.449 --> 00:66:13.250
on uh philosopher's views or not? Yeah. Well

1296
00:66:14.000 --> 00:66:15.728
, this in the street that I was just talking

1297
00:66:15.739 --> 00:66:18.219
about, it's sort of a mixed band in that

1298
00:66:18.269 --> 00:66:20.699
. What the study did is it looks at a

1299
00:66:20.708 --> 00:66:24.969
very large number of different philosophical views and a very

1300
00:66:24.978 --> 00:66:29.610
large number of um individual differences in human cognition and

1301
00:66:29.708 --> 00:66:32.510
overwhelmingly, the individual difference, variables don't predict their

1302
00:66:32.519 --> 00:66:34.329
philosophical views. So if you could consider all the

1303
00:66:34.340 --> 00:66:38.929
possible pairs, just overwhelmingly, there's no prediction.

1304
00:66:39.128 --> 00:66:41.139
And then if you look at most of the philosophical

1305
00:66:41.148 --> 00:66:42.938
views, what you find is that none of the

1306
00:66:42.949 --> 00:66:45.110
individual, different variables predict them. But, but

1307
00:66:45.119 --> 00:66:49.030
even though that's true, um we do find that

1308
00:66:49.039 --> 00:66:53.269
some philosophical views are predicted by some individual differences.

1309
00:66:53.489 --> 00:66:57.090
And the one example that I just gave was um

1310
00:66:57.449 --> 00:67:00.039
beliefs about what their objective truths about what's artistically good

1311
00:67:00.050 --> 00:67:02.389
really are predicted by something. I, I think

1312
00:67:02.398 --> 00:67:10.300
we might find other similar things like it, it

1313
00:67:10.309 --> 00:67:12.909
might be that there are some things going on.

1314
00:67:12.918 --> 00:67:15.550
It doesn't feel like that's gonna be like this overwhelming

1315
00:67:15.559 --> 00:67:17.929
thing that there's like a kind of personality that draws

1316
00:67:17.938 --> 00:67:21.079
you toward something or something else. Maybe there's personalities

1317
00:67:21.090 --> 00:67:24.489
that draw you towards certain methods. I don't know

1318
00:67:24.500 --> 00:67:27.418
what it will turn out to be true. Ok

1319
00:67:27.429 --> 00:67:30.320
. So, uh now to also try to get

1320
00:67:30.329 --> 00:67:33.550
into the production of scientific knowledge and since we've been

1321
00:67:33.559 --> 00:67:38.519
talking about moral judgment a lot, uh do we

1322
00:67:38.530 --> 00:67:43.500
know if uh people's moral judgments also influence the intuitions

1323
00:67:43.510 --> 00:67:47.949
they hold uh in folk psychology and moral cognition,

1324
00:67:47.969 --> 00:67:50.208
for example. Oh, yeah. Well, a

1325
00:67:50.409 --> 00:67:55.260
really surprising result that we get again and again is

1326
00:67:55.269 --> 00:67:59.958
that um moral intuitions affect what's called folk psychology.

1327
00:67:59.969 --> 00:68:01.878
So, folk psychology is the ability to just figure

1328
00:68:01.889 --> 00:68:04.159
out what's going on in other people's minds, like

1329
00:68:04.168 --> 00:68:06.869
what people are. So, the example I gave

1330
00:68:06.878 --> 00:68:11.648
before was about the true self that, um,

1331
00:68:12.228 --> 00:68:15.070
when you're, whether you, what you think is

1332
00:68:15.079 --> 00:68:16.060
morally good or morally bad affects what you think is

1333
00:68:16.069 --> 00:68:18.628
going on deep down in the other percent. But

1334
00:68:18.640 --> 00:68:21.319
maybe the most well known, um, uh,

1335
00:68:21.338 --> 00:68:24.399
result I have along those lines is not, not

1336
00:68:24.409 --> 00:68:26.878
about the true self. It's about just whether someone

1337
00:68:26.890 --> 00:68:29.520
did something intentionally like did they do it on purpose

1338
00:68:29.810 --> 00:68:31.239
? So I'll just give you two different cases and

1339
00:68:31.250 --> 00:68:33.350
they're just gonna do for morally. So here's the

1340
00:68:33.359 --> 00:68:35.708
first case. So imagine the vice president of a

1341
00:68:35.720 --> 00:68:38.539
company goes to the CEO. It's OK. We've

1342
00:68:38.548 --> 00:68:41.069
got this new policy. It's gonna make huge amounts

1343
00:68:41.079 --> 00:68:43.430
of money for our company, but it's also gonna

1344
00:68:43.439 --> 00:68:45.470
harm the environment. And the CEO says, look

1345
00:68:45.479 --> 00:68:46.838
, I know it's gonna harm the environment. I

1346
00:68:46.850 --> 00:68:48.548
don't care at all about that. All I care

1347
00:68:48.560 --> 00:68:50.668
about is just making as much money as we possibly

1348
00:68:50.680 --> 00:68:54.369
can. So let's implement the policy. So they

1349
00:68:54.378 --> 00:68:56.649
implement the policy and then sure enough, it harms

1350
00:68:56.659 --> 00:68:59.890
the environment and the participants are asked, did the

1351
00:68:59.899 --> 00:69:01.609
CEO do it on purpose? Did this CEO do

1352
00:69:01.619 --> 00:69:04.359
it intentionally? And there are people overwhelmingly say yes

1353
00:69:04.369 --> 00:69:06.449
, the CEO did it intentionally if you ask them

1354
00:69:06.458 --> 00:69:10.149
why most participants say something like, well, he

1355
00:69:10.159 --> 00:69:13.100
totally knew that he was gonna harm the environment and

1356
00:69:13.109 --> 00:69:15.060
then he did it anyway. But we thought maybe

1357
00:69:15.069 --> 00:69:16.909
there's something more going on. It's not just about

1358
00:69:16.918 --> 00:69:19.359
the knowledge. So suppose you just changed the word

1359
00:69:19.369 --> 00:69:21.100
harm to help. So we're gonna leave everything else

1360
00:69:21.109 --> 00:69:24.020
the same. Ok. The vice president goes to

1361
00:69:24.029 --> 00:69:26.619
the CEO and says we've got this new policy,

1362
00:69:26.628 --> 00:69:28.739
it's gonna make huge amounts of money for our company

1363
00:69:28.829 --> 00:69:30.489
and it's also gonna help the environment. And the

1364
00:69:30.500 --> 00:69:32.128
CEO says, look, you know, it's gonna

1365
00:69:32.140 --> 00:69:34.109
help the environment, but I don't care at all

1366
00:69:34.119 --> 00:69:36.208
about that. All I care about is just making

1367
00:69:36.220 --> 00:69:39.569
as much money as we possibly can. So let's

1368
00:69:39.579 --> 00:69:42.699
implement the policy so they implement the policy and then

1369
00:69:42.708 --> 00:69:44.560
sure enough, it helps the environment. Did he

1370
00:69:44.569 --> 00:69:47.009
help the environment? Intentionally? Other participants overwhelmingly saying

1371
00:69:47.020 --> 00:69:50.279
no. So thinking about those two cases, it

1372
00:69:50.289 --> 00:69:53.579
feels like this really weird thing is going on that

1373
00:69:53.588 --> 00:69:55.609
the only difference between them is that one is about

1374
00:69:55.619 --> 00:69:57.739
doing something bad and one is about doing something good

1375
00:69:58.168 --> 00:70:00.310
. The question people are being asked isn't about like

1376
00:70:00.810 --> 00:70:02.039
whether they deserve blame or praise or anything like that

1377
00:70:02.048 --> 00:70:03.199
. It's just being asked, did they do it

1378
00:70:03.208 --> 00:70:08.168
on purpose and judgments of whether it's bad or good

1379
00:70:08.180 --> 00:70:10.319
or somehow affecting judgments about whether you did it on

1380
00:70:10.329 --> 00:70:15.949
purpose. And so I if moral judgments influence the

1381
00:70:15.958 --> 00:70:23.180
intuitions people hold when it comes to psychology, can

1382
00:70:23.189 --> 00:70:28.020
that also translate into the production of scientific knowledge?

1383
00:70:28.029 --> 00:70:32.918
I mean, can moral judgments also affect the scientists

1384
00:70:32.930 --> 00:70:38.079
themselves. Oh, yeah. So you mean when

1385
00:70:38.088 --> 00:70:41.250
scientists are trying to answer these questions, maybe they

1386
00:70:41.259 --> 00:70:44.659
themselves are kind of being driven. Yeah, that's

1387
00:70:44.668 --> 00:70:46.949
a really wonderful question. And, um, what

1388
00:70:46.958 --> 00:70:49.548
, what we really want to know to answer your

1389
00:70:49.560 --> 00:70:55.470
question is like something like when you, if you

1390
00:70:55.479 --> 00:70:58.208
look at the actual evolution of research programs are those

1391
00:70:58.220 --> 00:71:01.259
research programs being driven by, by these moral judgments

1392
00:71:01.458 --> 00:71:04.208
? And it's very hard for us to do that

1393
00:71:04.220 --> 00:71:06.470
to study that question. And the reason is it

1394
00:71:06.479 --> 00:71:09.069
is hard to run an experiment. Like you'd want

1395
00:71:09.079 --> 00:71:11.208
to be like, OK, we randomly sign different

1396
00:71:11.220 --> 00:71:14.359
scientific research programs to different moral statuses. But we

1397
00:71:14.369 --> 00:71:16.399
can't do anything like that scientific research programs just happen

1398
00:71:16.409 --> 00:71:18.289
. However they happen, then we can just study

1399
00:71:18.298 --> 00:71:21.079
them. Mhm The thing that we did and I'm

1400
00:71:21.088 --> 00:71:24.619
not sure if this is this might really not help

1401
00:71:24.628 --> 00:71:26.680
to in a deeper way, answer your question.

1402
00:71:26.979 --> 00:71:30.640
You should just run experiments where we ask scientists questions

1403
00:71:30.259 --> 00:71:34.159
. So we, we um we just had scientists

1404
00:71:34.298 --> 00:71:36.060
and then we're asking them like, consider this case

1405
00:71:36.069 --> 00:71:38.750
, can you apply this concept to this case?

1406
00:71:38.850 --> 00:71:41.119
And then we do get effects of morality. So

1407
00:71:41.128 --> 00:71:42.899
I'll just give you one of these things. So

1408
00:71:42.909 --> 00:71:45.699
we ask people about the concept of being innate.

1409
00:71:45.810 --> 00:71:49.100
And then, um and then, uh we said

1410
00:71:49.149 --> 00:71:51.649
, um we give them different questions and then we

1411
00:71:51.659 --> 00:71:56.439
asked these scientists like biologists, linguists, psychologists in

1412
00:71:56.449 --> 00:71:59.649
these different cases is this thing in it. And

1413
00:71:59.659 --> 00:72:01.359
then what we do see is the effect of morality

1414
00:72:01.659 --> 00:72:03.680
. So, um, well, here's an example

1415
00:72:03.750 --> 00:72:05.838
, participants were told, imagine there's this trait,

1416
00:72:05.850 --> 00:72:10.189
it's called trait X. And now imagine people's genes

1417
00:72:10.199 --> 00:72:12.270
are such that if any, if their parents ever

1418
00:72:12.279 --> 00:72:15.958
treat them with kindness, then um they're gonna develop

1419
00:72:15.970 --> 00:72:17.829
trade X. But everyone's parents treat them with kindness

1420
00:72:17.838 --> 00:72:21.000
at least sometimes. So everyone develops trade X is

1421
00:72:21.009 --> 00:72:24.899
trade X in it and their participants tend to say

1422
00:72:24.909 --> 00:72:27.539
yes. And now, I mean, the person

1423
00:72:27.548 --> 00:72:29.128
was in the other condition were given the sy case

1424
00:72:29.140 --> 00:72:30.750
, they were told, imagine there's trait, it's

1425
00:72:30.759 --> 00:72:32.640
called trade X. And people's genes are such that

1426
00:72:32.649 --> 00:72:34.529
if their parents are ever mean to them, they'll

1427
00:72:34.539 --> 00:72:38.199
develop trade act, but everyone's parents are mean to

1428
00:72:38.208 --> 00:72:40.759
them at least sometimes. So everyone develops trade X

1429
00:72:40.949 --> 00:72:43.708
is trade act in the and their participants seem to

1430
00:72:43.720 --> 00:72:47.079
say no about participants. I don't mean like um

1431
00:72:47.088 --> 00:72:48.899
just, you know, random people on the street

1432
00:72:48.909 --> 00:72:51.529
. I mean, these are psychologists, linguists,

1433
00:72:51.539 --> 00:72:55.878
biologists, people who are using this concept. So

1434
00:72:56.239 --> 00:72:59.609
at least in their answers to these questions, these

1435
00:72:59.619 --> 00:73:04.859
scientists judgments are being affected by immorality. So I

1436
00:73:04.869 --> 00:73:08.439
, I mean, at uh can we at least

1437
00:73:08.449 --> 00:73:15.338
say that um scientists are not immune to their own

1438
00:73:15.350 --> 00:73:20.168
moral judgments when they are producing knowledge? Right.

1439
00:73:20.270 --> 00:73:23.500
Yeah. Well, we can definitely say that there's

1440
00:73:23.509 --> 00:73:27.560
not something within the minds of the individual scientists that

1441
00:73:27.770 --> 00:73:30.109
makes this not have an effect. And then the

1442
00:73:30.119 --> 00:73:33.449
key question that we would face if we really wanted

1443
00:73:33.458 --> 00:73:35.739
to answer your question. And I'm not sure if

1444
00:73:35.750 --> 00:73:40.009
our data speak to your larger question is not a

1445
00:73:40.020 --> 00:73:41.539
question about what's going on in the mind of each

1446
00:73:41.548 --> 00:73:45.720
individual scientist, but a question about the larger kind

1447
00:73:45.729 --> 00:73:48.350
of social structures that allow scientific research to progress.

1448
00:73:48.378 --> 00:73:51.759
So it's not like um when you're trained as a

1449
00:73:51.770 --> 00:73:55.279
scientist, you develop some special thing in your brain

1450
00:73:55.289 --> 00:73:57.939
that allows you to not have morality influence it,

1451
00:73:57.949 --> 00:74:00.789
that is not happening. So if there was some

1452
00:74:00.798 --> 00:74:04.628
way that morality would not influence things or not influence

1453
00:74:04.640 --> 00:74:08.890
it in quite the same way or, or have

1454
00:74:08.899 --> 00:74:11.128
a decreased influence or anything like that, it,

1455
00:74:11.140 --> 00:74:14.390
it wouldn't be something in the mind of the individual

1456
00:74:14.399 --> 00:74:16.418
scientists. It would have to be something in the

1457
00:74:16.430 --> 00:74:20.109
whole way that science is structured. Like for example

1458
00:74:20.119 --> 00:74:24.850
, the fact that that um you're not just seeing

1459
00:74:24.859 --> 00:74:27.500
stuff, you're trying to get it um published in

1460
00:74:27.509 --> 00:74:30.250
a journal and the peer reviewers on that journal might

1461
00:74:30.259 --> 00:74:32.859
have different moral judgments than you. And so you're

1462
00:74:33.168 --> 00:74:35.470
the way that you're gonna paper is gonna eventually turn

1463
00:74:35.479 --> 00:74:38.329
out is not going to be just a pure reflection

1464
00:74:38.338 --> 00:74:41.329
of your own moral judgments, but also of this

1465
00:74:41.338 --> 00:74:45.000
larger um interpersonal structure that involves people with very different

1466
00:74:45.009 --> 00:74:48.689
moral judgments, all kind of working together to eventually

1467
00:74:48.699 --> 00:74:51.789
create a series of publications that actually get published in

1468
00:74:51.798 --> 00:74:56.600
journals. Mhm. No, I also asked you

1469
00:74:56.609 --> 00:75:00.509
about that because people today are discussing a lot,

1470
00:75:00.520 --> 00:75:04.708
the potential effects that, uh, moral values and

1471
00:75:04.720 --> 00:75:08.668
political values more specifically of, of course, the

1472
00:75:08.680 --> 00:75:14.069
relationship between morality and politics is not, uh,

1473
00:75:14.458 --> 00:75:17.404
completely well under, I mean, I've talked with

1474
00:75:17.414 --> 00:75:21.694
political scientists and political psychologists on the show and it's

1475
00:75:21.704 --> 00:75:28.634
complicated to really understand what's the real relationship between morality

1476
00:75:28.645 --> 00:75:30.744
and politics or moral values and political values. But

1477
00:75:30.753 --> 00:75:34.975
anyway, people uh now uh nowadays are discussing a

1478
00:75:34.984 --> 00:75:44.079
lot uh the potential negative impacts of uh certain political

1479
00:75:44.088 --> 00:75:47.759
ideologies within academia and so on. And I mean

1480
00:75:47.770 --> 00:75:51.060
, I was trying to understand if some of your

1481
00:75:51.069 --> 00:75:56.899
work when it comes in this case, not necessarily

1482
00:75:57.060 --> 00:76:00.009
having to do with politics, but more with moral

1483
00:76:00.020 --> 00:76:04.079
judgment if it would tell us something or have something

1484
00:76:04.088 --> 00:76:09.479
to perhaps add to depth discussion and to what extent

1485
00:76:09.489 --> 00:76:15.579
we should or shouldn't be worried about uh people's beliefs

1486
00:76:15.588 --> 00:76:19.548
basically. Yeah, our, our work con the

1487
00:76:19.560 --> 00:76:21.509
work some of the work that we've done recently contributes

1488
00:76:21.520 --> 00:76:25.390
to that question in a very small way. So

1489
00:76:25.689 --> 00:76:27.958
if you will be disappointed with a very small contribution

1490
00:76:27.970 --> 00:76:29.449
, we may maybe it will be helpful, maybe

1491
00:76:29.458 --> 00:76:32.689
be interesting. So um one question that people have

1492
00:76:32.699 --> 00:76:36.588
often um been troubled by is the question about the

1493
00:76:36.600 --> 00:76:43.489
influence of essentialism on prejudice. So the thought is

1494
00:76:43.500 --> 00:76:46.770
um uh people have certain kind of scientific beliefs um

1495
00:76:46.779 --> 00:76:48.600
by, by scientifically I don't mean, um,

1496
00:76:48.609 --> 00:76:51.060
beliefs of people who are scientists. I meant,

1497
00:76:51.279 --> 00:76:53.729
like, if you're just an ordinary person you have

1498
00:76:53.739 --> 00:76:55.520
scientific beliefs because I don't know, you go to

1499
00:76:55.529 --> 00:76:57.020
high school, you just start to develop, like

1500
00:76:57.029 --> 00:77:00.239
, beliefs about scientific questions. Mhm. One kind

1501
00:77:00.250 --> 00:77:01.159
of belief that you could have is what people sometimes

1502
00:77:01.168 --> 00:77:03.418
call an essentialist belief. So you could think.

1503
00:77:03.649 --> 00:77:05.779
Um, I don't know. For example, I

1504
00:77:05.789 --> 00:77:10.060
, I'm Jewish and some people think, um,

1505
00:77:10.069 --> 00:77:13.989
there's some sort of like, um, Jewish essence

1506
00:77:14.000 --> 00:77:15.458
that's sort of like biological, that all Jewish people

1507
00:77:15.470 --> 00:77:18.798
have and differentiates them from not Jewish people. And

1508
00:77:18.810 --> 00:77:24.088
then it's been a real concern in our field that

1509
00:77:24.100 --> 00:77:28.039
, um, those beliefs, essentialist beliefs might give

1510
00:77:28.048 --> 00:77:30.430
rise to prejudice. The, the more you centralize

1511
00:77:30.439 --> 00:77:31.759
a certain group, like, for example, the

1512
00:77:31.770 --> 00:77:33.930
more you think there's like a Jewish essence, the

1513
00:77:33.939 --> 00:77:36.180
more you'll be prejudiced against that group, for example

1514
00:77:36.189 --> 00:77:39.878
, the more you'll be anti-semitic. So, thought

1515
00:77:39.890 --> 00:77:42.208
that was right. Then you might think instead of

1516
00:77:42.220 --> 00:77:44.350
just seeing whatever we think is true about these kind

1517
00:77:44.359 --> 00:77:46.789
of questions regarding genetic basis of racial groups or something

1518
00:77:46.798 --> 00:77:49.750
like that. We have a real reason, a

1519
00:77:49.759 --> 00:77:53.600
, a moral reason to not say certain things because

1520
00:77:53.609 --> 00:77:56.640
seeing those things might increase prejudice, increase discrimination,

1521
00:77:56.708 --> 00:77:58.949
which I find it to be a very plausible view

1522
00:77:59.430 --> 00:78:01.640
. So, um, April Ba and I,

1523
00:78:02.069 --> 00:78:05.289
we thought that view was right. And so we

1524
00:78:05.298 --> 00:78:08.369
, um, we wanted to, uh, sort

1525
00:78:08.378 --> 00:78:10.720
of build on it and extend it in certain ways

1526
00:78:10.939 --> 00:78:12.779
. And so we ran a whole series of studies

1527
00:78:12.789 --> 00:78:15.520
in which we have manipulated the degree to which people

1528
00:78:15.529 --> 00:78:17.779
thought there was kind of a genetic essence of a

1529
00:78:17.789 --> 00:78:20.378
particular social group. And then we checked to see

1530
00:78:20.390 --> 00:78:24.680
whether there was a downstream effect on, on prejudice

1531
00:78:24.689 --> 00:78:27.159
or stereotyping. And in all of the studies,

1532
00:78:27.168 --> 00:78:28.789
again and again, we found the same result.

1533
00:78:28.869 --> 00:78:30.338
So here's what the result is. First of all

1534
00:78:30.350 --> 00:78:32.609
, there is a correlation between those two things.

1535
00:78:32.619 --> 00:78:38.270
So the more people centralize, the more they think

1536
00:78:38.279 --> 00:78:40.359
, the more they are prejudiced against those other groups

1537
00:78:40.369 --> 00:78:43.060
. So in my example, Judaism idea would be

1538
00:78:43.869 --> 00:78:45.439
um if you looked across a whole bunch of different

1539
00:78:45.449 --> 00:78:46.750
people and you measured whether they think there's like a

1540
00:78:46.759 --> 00:78:49.979
genetic basis of being Jewish, though the person,

1541
00:78:49.989 --> 00:78:53.789
people who more think there is are gonna be more

1542
00:78:53.798 --> 00:78:55.470
anti Semitic than the people who less think there is

1543
00:78:56.020 --> 00:78:58.600
. The second thing we found is that if you

1544
00:78:58.609 --> 00:79:01.239
change people's essentialism, like for example, we make

1545
00:79:01.250 --> 00:79:03.640
people more essentialist or make them less essentialist that has

1546
00:79:03.649 --> 00:79:06.259
no effect at all on how prejudiced they are.

1547
00:79:08.699 --> 00:79:11.939
So what those two things together seem to suggest is

1548
00:79:11.949 --> 00:79:14.159
that the causal arrow is going the other way.

1549
00:79:15.588 --> 00:79:17.250
So if you think about, I don't know,

1550
00:79:17.259 --> 00:79:20.569
Hitler was very anti Semitic and also thought there was

1551
00:79:20.579 --> 00:79:25.500
like this essential, essential aspect of Judi. So

1552
00:79:25.509 --> 00:79:27.378
what I say you could think is just for whatever

1553
00:79:27.390 --> 00:79:30.279
reason she just happened to think there's like this,

1554
00:79:30.509 --> 00:79:34.250
um, heritable genetic thing and then that caused him

1555
00:79:34.259 --> 00:79:38.128
to be anti Semitic. But maybe it's the other

1556
00:79:38.140 --> 00:79:41.088
way, it's that for whatever reason, he hated

1557
00:79:41.100 --> 00:79:43.890
this group of people and then he hitting this group

1558
00:79:43.899 --> 00:79:47.159
of people led him to think this weird stuff.

1559
00:79:47.168 --> 00:79:51.579
Like, so then if we could somehow make him

1560
00:79:51.588 --> 00:79:55.159
stop believing all of that weird stuff, like about

1561
00:79:55.378 --> 00:79:58.479
heritability or something, it, it wouldn't make him

1562
00:79:58.489 --> 00:80:00.958
be less an anti Semitic. It's only, it's

1563
00:80:00.970 --> 00:80:01.088
the other way. If we could make him less

1564
00:80:01.100 --> 00:80:03.418
anti-semitic, then it would make him less involved in

1565
00:80:03.430 --> 00:80:09.970
this weird stuff. So this one thing seemed to

1566
00:80:09.979 --> 00:80:13.539
suggest it's really going the other way. It's not

1567
00:80:13.548 --> 00:80:16.470
that people's scientific beliefs are having these downstream impacts on

1568
00:80:16.479 --> 00:80:18.759
their moral judgments. It's that people's moral judgments are

1569
00:80:18.770 --> 00:80:24.520
having these downstream impacts on their scientific beliefs. That

1570
00:80:24.529 --> 00:80:27.739
, that's, that's really fascinating. So, uh

1571
00:80:27.750 --> 00:80:30.279
I mean, uh yeah, because we tend to

1572
00:80:30.289 --> 00:80:34.529
have this idea that if people are essentialist, then

1573
00:80:34.720 --> 00:80:42.409
that cause that causes their uh beliefs, their discriminatory

1574
00:80:42.418 --> 00:80:45.509
or hateful be beliefs. But then what you're saying

1575
00:80:45.520 --> 00:80:49.229
there is that it could be the other way around

1576
00:80:49.239 --> 00:80:55.640
that people already have those beliefs and then uh that

1577
00:80:55.649 --> 00:81:00.689
would cause them to be essentially sort, we centralize

1578
00:81:00.699 --> 00:81:03.289
certain groups of people. Yeah, that's the result

1579
00:81:03.298 --> 00:81:06.100
we're getting, we very much expected it to be

1580
00:81:06.109 --> 00:81:08.529
the other way, the way that you said.

1581
00:81:08.819 --> 00:81:11.649
But I don't confirm what we thought, like,

1582
00:81:11.659 --> 00:81:13.720
it really feels like. Yeah, if, if

1583
00:81:13.729 --> 00:81:15.180
we took some very racist people and all we did

1584
00:81:15.189 --> 00:81:17.259
was say, um, you know, here's some

1585
00:81:17.270 --> 00:81:20.588
interesting results about genetics or something like that and then

1586
00:81:20.600 --> 00:81:23.350
suppose that they were very convinced they were like,

1587
00:81:23.359 --> 00:81:24.939
oh, yeah, I really appreciate all this genetic

1588
00:81:24.949 --> 00:81:27.680
information. Sound. That sounds totally right. That

1589
00:81:27.689 --> 00:81:29.798
wouldn't make them less racist. It's just, it's

1590
00:81:29.810 --> 00:81:30.539
, it's like, that's not the thing that would

1591
00:81:30.548 --> 00:81:33.479
actually change the, the degree to which they're doing

1592
00:81:33.489 --> 00:81:38.418
racist things. Yeah, that's very interesting. So

1593
00:81:38.569 --> 00:81:41.729
, uh I have a couple of more questions uh

1594
00:81:41.739 --> 00:81:47.048
now regarding how people understand truth itself, so does

1595
00:81:47.060 --> 00:81:50.520
the way people interact socially? I mean, if

1596
00:81:50.529 --> 00:81:57.109
they are cooperating or competing, more influence how they

1597
00:81:57.119 --> 00:82:01.369
comes through truth in terms of subjectivity or objectivity.

1598
00:82:01.979 --> 00:82:03.609
Yeah, this really relates to the topic we were

1599
00:82:03.619 --> 00:82:05.390
talking about a really long time ago, we were

1600
00:82:05.399 --> 00:82:09.239
talking about whether people think there even is an objective

1601
00:82:09.250 --> 00:82:11.259
, the right answer to a question. So in

1602
00:82:11.270 --> 00:82:14.609
these studies with Matthew Fisher, we had participants randomly

1603
00:82:14.619 --> 00:82:16.088
assigned to two groups. So in one group,

1604
00:82:16.270 --> 00:82:18.729
they were told, OK, you're gonna talk with

1605
00:82:18.739 --> 00:82:21.079
someone who has the opposite opinion of you on some

1606
00:82:21.088 --> 00:82:24.859
, on this topic. So um for example,

1607
00:82:24.869 --> 00:82:26.850
if you're pro choice, this other person will be

1608
00:82:26.859 --> 00:82:29.399
pro-life or if you're in favor of the death penalty

1609
00:82:29.409 --> 00:82:30.939
, this other person will be opposed to the death

1610
00:82:30.949 --> 00:82:32.708
penalty. And then, and they really are talking

1611
00:82:33.338 --> 00:82:35.899
, they really are engaged in this discussion with this

1612
00:82:35.909 --> 00:82:38.989
other person. They're doing it on the internet,

1613
00:82:39.000 --> 00:82:41.338
like through this kind of chat service. And then

1614
00:82:41.640 --> 00:82:43.949
in one group we said, um, so what

1615
00:82:43.958 --> 00:82:45.659
you have to do is like, win the argument

1616
00:82:45.668 --> 00:82:46.739
. Like, um this other person is gonna argue

1617
00:82:46.750 --> 00:82:48.939
, say for the pro life position, you have

1618
00:82:48.949 --> 00:82:51.958
to like beat them and, and win for the

1619
00:82:51.970 --> 00:82:56.029
um pro choice position. But in the other condition

1620
00:82:56.039 --> 00:82:58.739
, he said, um this other person has the

1621
00:82:58.750 --> 00:83:00.289
opposite view of you. And we want you to

1622
00:83:00.298 --> 00:83:02.869
like, try to understand this other person and for

1623
00:83:02.878 --> 00:83:05.640
you and this other person to kind of corporate to

1624
00:83:05.649 --> 00:83:08.970
each understand where the other one is coming from.

1625
00:83:08.979 --> 00:83:10.810
Like why do they think the things they do?

1626
00:83:10.819 --> 00:83:13.899
Like what's their perspective and so forth? So then

1627
00:83:13.909 --> 00:83:16.789
participants um are just like having a conversation where they're

1628
00:83:16.798 --> 00:83:18.470
like writing back and forth to each other in this

1629
00:83:18.479 --> 00:83:21.609
way, either to defeat the other or to um

1630
00:83:21.619 --> 00:83:25.949
understand the other. And then after silver, then

1631
00:83:25.958 --> 00:83:28.289
we ask the kind of question we talked about earlier

1632
00:83:28.298 --> 00:83:30.619
, is there really a truth about this question?

1633
00:83:30.029 --> 00:83:34.289
So say about the abortion question, is there really

1634
00:83:34.298 --> 00:83:38.680
a right answer between pro life and portraits? And

1635
00:83:38.689 --> 00:83:40.449
what we find is that the more you're in a

1636
00:83:40.458 --> 00:83:42.869
competitive interaction where you're trying to like defeat the other

1637
00:83:42.878 --> 00:83:45.560
person, the more you think there is an objective

1638
00:83:45.569 --> 00:83:47.109
answer. And when you're in a co-operative interaction.

1639
00:83:47.119 --> 00:83:48.649
We're trying to understand the other person, the more

1640
00:83:48.659 --> 00:83:55.399
you think there isn't even a correct. And so

1641
00:83:55.409 --> 00:83:58.220
with that in mind, uh my last question will

1642
00:83:58.229 --> 00:84:04.279
be then can politics and specifically political polarization change our

1643
00:84:04.289 --> 00:84:09.229
understanding of truth? That's a great question. I

1644
00:84:09.239 --> 00:84:11.180
, I don't know the answer to your question,

1645
00:84:11.189 --> 00:84:12.989
but I'm even though I don't know, I'm just

1646
00:84:13.000 --> 00:84:15.689
gonna make a, make a guess. So,

1647
00:84:15.119 --> 00:84:19.489
um right now, what we find is that um

1648
00:84:19.859 --> 00:84:23.689
uh well, there's a correlation that the, the

1649
00:84:23.699 --> 00:84:26.009
more people are divided about some question, the more

1650
00:84:26.020 --> 00:84:28.489
people think there's no objectively right answer to it.

1651
00:84:28.689 --> 00:84:30.390
So, um if you ask, is there a

1652
00:84:30.399 --> 00:84:32.529
right answer about whether murder is morally wrong? People

1653
00:84:32.539 --> 00:84:34.239
think there is, if you ask is the right

1654
00:84:34.250 --> 00:84:36.649
answer about whether abortion is morally wrong. People tend

1655
00:84:36.659 --> 00:84:41.458
to think that there's not. And then, although

1656
00:84:41.470 --> 00:84:43.439
we don't have any data to suggest this, my

1657
00:84:43.449 --> 00:84:47.338
guess is that that effect arises because people are able

1658
00:84:47.350 --> 00:84:49.239
to think about people on the opposite side of this

1659
00:84:49.250 --> 00:84:51.319
issue in a certain way, they're able to like

1660
00:84:51.649 --> 00:84:54.909
kind of take the perspective of the that person and

1661
00:84:54.918 --> 00:84:57.750
care about that person and so forth. But if

1662
00:84:57.759 --> 00:85:00.668
polarization continues to grow, so that we're really forming

1663
00:85:00.680 --> 00:85:03.199
almost like two nations where people never interact with each

1664
00:85:03.208 --> 00:85:04.569
other and never talk with each other. They don't

1665
00:85:04.579 --> 00:85:06.909
even care whether the other person likes them and they're

1666
00:85:06.918 --> 00:85:09.729
just each talking with people on their own side of

1667
00:85:09.739 --> 00:85:11.930
the aisle and not connecting with people. Not yet

1668
00:85:12.759 --> 00:85:15.100
. My guess would be that it will gradually change

1669
00:85:15.109 --> 00:85:16.588
. And this tendency that we see right now,

1670
00:85:16.600 --> 00:85:19.750
if people say maybe that person isn't actually wrong,

1671
00:85:19.759 --> 00:85:23.628
maybe there's no truth of the matter that will decrease

1672
00:85:23.640 --> 00:85:26.069
and then people will start to see there's only one

1673
00:85:26.079 --> 00:85:27.979
truth and it's our truth. We're the ones who

1674
00:85:27.989 --> 00:85:31.319
are right and most people are. Ok, great

1675
00:85:31.329 --> 00:85:34.140
. So, uh Josh, just before we go

1676
00:85:34.149 --> 00:85:36.579
, would you like to tell people where they can

1677
00:85:36.588 --> 00:85:40.869
find you and your work on the internet? Oh

1678
00:85:40.878 --> 00:85:43.640
, I don't know. I mean, uh wait

1679
00:85:43.649 --> 00:85:45.958
, that's a great question. You, I guess

1680
00:85:45.619 --> 00:85:47.298
maybe you, I mean, you could just go

1681
00:85:47.310 --> 00:85:49.418
to my website but that might not be much fun

1682
00:85:49.430 --> 00:85:51.859
. Maybe a fun thing to do would be if

1683
00:85:51.869 --> 00:85:56.029
you look up experimental philosophy on, on youtube,

1684
00:85:56.128 --> 00:86:00.000
you can find uh videos of that are explaining different

1685
00:86:00.009 --> 00:86:02.159
experimental philosophy studies and that's sort of where people are

1686
00:86:02.168 --> 00:86:04.439
acting out these little stories that I just told you

1687
00:86:04.449 --> 00:86:08.430
and that might be much more enjoyable. OK,

1688
00:86:08.439 --> 00:86:11.350
great. So, thank you so much for taking

1689
00:86:11.359 --> 00:86:13.720
the time to come on the show. It's been

1690
00:86:13.729 --> 00:86:15.029
real fun to talk to you. Thank you so

1691
00:86:15.039 --> 00:86:18.359
much. I really appreciate this. Hi guys.

1692
00:86:18.369 --> 00:86:21.069
Thank you for watching this interview until the end.
