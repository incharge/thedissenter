00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.920
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loops. And

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.989
today I'm joined by Doctor Joshua Nobi. He is

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.800
Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics and Psychology at Yale

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.158
University. A lot of his recent research has been

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.159
concerned with the impact of people's moral judgments on

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.010
their intuitions about questions that might initially appear to

8
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.340
be entirely independent of morality. But as we're going

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.520
to talk about today, apparently they are not. So

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.259
Josh, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

11
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.759
everyone.

12
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:36.119
Thanks Ricardo. It's really good to be here.

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.029
So I would like to start by asking you

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.159
about experimental philosophy. So what is experimental philosophy? Really?

15
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.459
And how does it differ from, let's say armchair

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.430
philosophy?

17
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.569
Yeah. Awesome question. So experimental philosophy is the field

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.669
that started around 20 years ago in the beginning

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.040
of the 21st century. And it's a field that

20
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.169
really is the merger of two different things. So

21
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.599
on one hand, it uses these methods that are

22
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.519
the methods we see all the time in psychology.

23
00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.239
So we run experiments that very much look like

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.730
psychology experiments and use the same statistics, the same

25
00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.470
kinds of experimental designs that you see all the

26
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.300
time in the field of psychology. But at a

27
00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:25.250
kind of theoretical level, it's really very closely connected

28
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.589
to philosophy. So there's this tradition in philosophy, going

29
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.900
back thousands of years of thinking about, for example,

30
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.709
thought experiments where if you open up some work

31
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.940
from Plato, you'll see him thinking. OK, let's talk

32
00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:41.580
about the concept of justice. Um Now consider this

33
00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:43.720
case, would you say that's justice? Now, what about

34
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.989
this, this justice and gradually trying to understand what

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.319
justice is by considering thought experiments of that type.

36
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.500
So experimental philosophy is a field that kind of

37
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.440
merges those two things. So it's a field that's

38
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.250
drawing on this very long tradition within philosophy of

39
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.180
trying to understand these concepts using this particular kind

40
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.860
of approach to understanding them and the methods that

41
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.599
we see in psychology of just running systematic experiments,

42
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.500
analyzing them using data and so forth. So what

43
00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.339
you see in an experimental philosophy study is something

44
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.259
that might look a little bit like what Plato

45
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.380
is doing in some sense except for that instead

46
00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.479
of um just seeing well, consider this case surely.

47
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.610
In that case, people would say this, it's we

48
00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.304
say consider this, we recruited 1000 participants, they were

49
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:29.835
randomly assigned to conditions in a three by two

50
00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:33.145
design. We analyzed what their responses were and we

51
00:02:33.154 --> 00:02:36.065
can see that people's responses are affected by these

52
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:39.225
factors. Now we're trying to develop a deeper understanding

53
00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:42.744
of what's going on within people's minds that shapes

54
00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:45.904
those judgments, what's going on in human cognition that

55
00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:47.345
makes them have the judgments they do.

56
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.429
But how does it differ from science? I mean,

57
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.550
if in terms of methodology, it seems so similar

58
00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.860
to what we see across several different sciences, then

59
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.190
why isn't it uh also science? Why is it

60
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.929
still philosophy?

61
00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.000
That's a great question. And I think that the

62
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.389
answer is that we should all think less about

63
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.070
that. So if you, if you look at what's

64
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.880
actually happening with this field of the experimental philosphy

65
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.539
experimental philosophy studies are just being published in the

66
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.789
same journals that or every other cognitive science um

67
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.500
kind of paper is being published in. So for

68
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.449
example, the journal Cognition, which is one of the

69
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.639
leading journals in the field of cognitive science, a

70
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.850
quantitative study of where experimental philosophy papers get published,

71
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.020
showed that one of the most common places to

72
00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:38.770
publish them is cognition. And when you send a

73
00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.660
paper to cognition, they don't do some special philosophy

74
00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.820
way of thinking about it. They're just thinking about

75
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.509
it as a contribution to cognitive science. So it's

76
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.410
not as though there's some kind of sharp divide

77
00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.779
that we really want to say we are not

78
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.330
scientists, we're philosophers and the things we're doing are

79
00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.789
not contributions to science, they are contributions to philosophy,

80
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.309
which is something separate. But although there's no sharp

81
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.850
divide like that, I really feel like there is

82
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.059
an important difference that there really is something different

83
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.070
about what's going on. So if you think about,

84
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.270
for example, this field that's at the intersection of

85
00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.070
psychology and economics in which people are trying to

86
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.130
study what's going on in people's minds that affects

87
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.779
their economic decision making. And there are people working

88
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.519
in that field who are psychologists and there are

89
00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.089
people working in that field who are economists. I

90
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.540
mean, it's not like there are two separate fields.

91
00:04:27.549 --> 00:04:29.570
I mean, there is a field of studying this

92
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.750
but still there's a difference that when an economist

93
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.029
studies those questions, it's different than when a psychologist

94
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.769
studies, those questions that economists are drawing this whole

95
00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:42.029
theoretical tradition that they, when they were um grad

96
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.519
students, they were like studying real analysis and like

97
00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:49.559
um microeconomic theory and and then they're bringing to

98
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.739
bear that whole tradition on these questions. I mean,

99
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.799
you think about what's going on in experimental philosophy,

100
00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.000
I feel like you see something really similar that

101
00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.420
it it might not be a rigid dichotomy between

102
00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:02.769
what we're doing and what people outside of philosophy

103
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.769
are doing. But there's something really clear if you

104
00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.739
open up one of these papers, you can tell

105
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.079
it's written by a philosopher that it's drawing on

106
00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.549
this kind of really rich theoretical tradition that all

107
00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.730
of us in philosophy have been steeped in from

108
00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:20.149
our undergraduate to graduate school through all of the

109
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.489
um interactions we're having now in philosophy departments and

110
00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:25.739
the research we're doing is really coming out of

111
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.630
that, that we've been thinking about Aristotle for decades.

112
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.480
And the study we're doing is very much influenced

113
00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:32.529
by that whole tradition,

114
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.779
right? But I mean, I guess that this also

115
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.220
puts into perspective, the relationship between science and philosophy

116
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.269
because in many ways there, there's not and uh

117
00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.809
there's uh there should, there should necessarily be a

118
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.424
strict division between the, let's say two fields of

119
00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:58.154
knowledge. I mean, historically speaking, of course, science even

120
00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:04.535
derived from philosophy. But nowadays, even when people try

121
00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:07.904
to make a strict division and say that philosophy

122
00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:10.274
is from the humanities, and then we have the

123
00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:15.195
sciences which are two separate things. Uh It doesn't

124
00:06:15.204 --> 00:06:17.274
have to be like that,

125
00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:20.394
right? We I really strongly agree that a lot

126
00:06:20.404 --> 00:06:24.640
of times experimental philosophy is presented as something new

127
00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.899
as the it's kind of rebelling against the tradition

128
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.709
of philosophy. But I completely agree with what you

129
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.179
just said, it should be seen instead as something

130
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.899
old that if you look at um what was

131
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.700
going on in the 19th century in philosophy. When

132
00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:42.429
you think about these figures like Karl Marx Friedrich,

133
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.559
Nietzsche Jon Stewart Mill, these people were very concerned

134
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.739
with empirical questions, questions about what human beings are

135
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.079
really like. And then they were trying to explore

136
00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.880
all those empirical questions using all the methods that

137
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.679
were available at that time to explore those questions

138
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.700
and then there was kind of this new fangled

139
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.200
revolution against all of that, that people start to

140
00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:07.010
say all that stuff that people traditionally did in

141
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:10.929
philosophy. That's not even philosophy, that's just science, philosophy.

142
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.470
Is this other thing that you can do from

143
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.309
your armchair without even um engaging with empirical data.

144
00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:20.010
And I think that that revolution against the traditional

145
00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:23.130
way of doing philosophy was just totally mistaken. There

146
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.959
was never anything wrong with the traditional way of

147
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.570
doing philosophy, that what those people were doing in

148
00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:30.940
the 19th century was just totally right. And we

149
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.190
should just go back. It was the exactly the

150
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.820
right approach that we should have this met mode

151
00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:41.269
of inquiry where we're not um distinguishing really strictly

152
00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.679
between these different things. We're trying to go after

153
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.940
these questions with all the methods at our disposal.

154
00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:50.140
And we're exploring questions that are kind of recognizably

155
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:54.619
philosophical. But we're exploring those questions by engaging with

156
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.920
all the empirical data we can get that will

157
00:07:56.929 --> 00:07:57.980
help us answer them.

158
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.579
So after that introduction, let's get into some of

159
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:08.089
the topics you explore in your work. So first

160
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.970
of all, what is belief,

161
00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:14.450
what is belief? But in the work that we've

162
00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.730
done on this topic, what we're concerned with is

163
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:20.730
how ordinary people figure out what other people believe.

164
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.350
So, um there's something in our minds that allows

165
00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.079
us to figure out what other people believe about.

166
00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:33.489
So if I um am uh thinking about another

167
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.919
person, I might think. Um Even though I'm right

168
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.119
here in my office, she doesn't know that she

169
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.159
thinks that I'm at home. So she believes that

170
00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.359
I'm at home. I know a question arises like,

171
00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:47.739
uh about how to understand the concept how people

172
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.570
think about. So, here's what we thought about that.

173
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.750
Here's what we argue for, with regard to that

174
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.179
question that are more basic way of that human

175
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.530
beings make sense of why other people do the

176
00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:02.309
things they do is not in terms of what

177
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.520
they believe in terms of what they know. So

178
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:07.650
the normal way of thinking about things is that

179
00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:09.880
I would just think, ok, you know, I'm right

180
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.929
now, I'm in my office. Does she know that

181
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.049
or not? And that way of thinking about things,

182
00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:17.760
thinking about what other people know is something that's

183
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.950
really fundamental and so fundamental that it's very much

184
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.909
shared with our other, with other primates and presumably

185
00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:26.809
with our common ancestor, with those other primates and

186
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.940
something that's just totally automatic. It, it as soon

187
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.320
as you see someone else and you're seeing like

188
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.890
what they're looking at and what they're not looking

189
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.859
at, you immediately are aware of which things they

190
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:38.059
know and which things they don't know. And then

191
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.640
the suggestion we had is that this ability that

192
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.599
human beings have to think that other people could

193
00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:46.580
believe something that's not true. That should be seen

194
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.489
as this fancy extra ability like something that only

195
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.780
human beings have, other primates don't have it. So

196
00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:56.859
this suggestion, we're making a sort of a reversal

197
00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:58.919
of the way cognitive scientists have often thought about

198
00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:01.969
this. The cognitive scientists have often thought the most

199
00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:03.940
basic aspect of how we make sense of other

200
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.890
people's minds is by thinking about what they believe

201
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.239
and what they want. And then we're suggesting, no,

202
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.020
it's the most basic way of thinking about it

203
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.250
is in terms of what people know and what

204
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.059
they want and then what they believe is when

205
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.609
you're doing that you're doing, like, just a very

206
00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:21.109
sophisticated thing that goes beyond the way people normally

207
00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:21.940
understand each other.

208
00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:28.479
But how should we go about distinguishing between belief

209
00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:32.440
and knowledge? I mean, what does really count as

210
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.119
knowledge?

211
00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:38.109
Oh. So, um, maybe a helpful thing to think

212
00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.679
about in terms of what things really come to

213
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.380
his knowledge is to understand that what knowledge is,

214
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.179
is not just the same thing as beliefs that

215
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.570
happen to be true. Mhm. So, suppose there's an

216
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.969
object and it's aimed at particular place and then

217
00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:55.070
the object is like moving all around while I'm

218
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.789
not looking at it, it's moving all, it's moving

219
00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:59.450
here, it's moving there and then just randomly it

220
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.650
happens to move back to the exact place that

221
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:03.770
it was when I was, when I was looking

222
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.419
at it, then if I hadn't been looking at

223
00:11:06.429 --> 00:11:08.969
it this whole time, I might believe it's in

224
00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:11.169
this place and it really is in this place.

225
00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:13.010
But I don't know, it's in this place. It's

226
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.599
just, I was just lucky. So, in a case

227
00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.599
like that, you might think, I believe it. And

228
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:23.219
it's true, but I don't actually know it. So,

229
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.900
the, the key idea now that we were introducing

230
00:11:26.909 --> 00:11:31.330
is that, um, that this ability to figure out

231
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.320
which things people know and which they don't know,

232
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.179
this is something shared with our, with other primates

233
00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:38.179
and this ability to figure out what things people

234
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.869
believe is not. So suppose you do it um

235
00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:47.299
this task now with a chimpanzee. So um I

236
00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:49.650
put something in this, in this place and you're

237
00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:52.200
watching me put it in this place and then

238
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.809
you look away. So just try it out so

239
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.349
our viewers can see. OK. Can you look away

240
00:11:56.359 --> 00:11:59.219
for a second? Yeah. OK. So now while you're

241
00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:01.419
looking at it just stays in this place and

242
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.460
now it's in this place, you can't, you can't

243
00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:05.780
see it. Now turn back. OK. Now once you

244
00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:08.940
turn back, I as the other, um as a

245
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.940
chimpanzee would expect that when you're trying to get

246
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.520
it, say it's a piece of food that you'd

247
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.030
look here and you wouldn't look here but not

248
00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:18.919
consider a different kind of case. So suppose I

249
00:12:18.929 --> 00:12:20.469
put the object in this place and then you

250
00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:23.429
look away. Now, while you're looking late, let's try,

251
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.020
can you demonstrate while you're looking at the object

252
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.340
moves all around, it's moving, it's moving, it's here,

253
00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:32.809
it's here. Ok. Now, look back. So now just

254
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.349
by chance it happened to end up in the

255
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:37.830
same place that it was when you looked away.

256
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.840
Another question is where does the chimpanzee expect you

257
00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:43.119
to go when you're trying to find it? And

258
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.520
the answer is chimpanzees are just completely a chance.

259
00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:47.609
They think it's totally random which place you go.

260
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.200
So that seems to indicate chimpanzees can figure out

261
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.960
which things you know, but they can't figure out

262
00:12:53.969 --> 00:12:55.880
which things you believe, you believe it's here, but

263
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.369
you don't know it's here. So they have no

264
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.780
idea where you think it is.

265
00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:05.400
Yeah. And from the perspective of cognitive science, what

266
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:11.130
is more basic representations of knowledge or representations of

267
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.840
belief? And that at least what we suggest. And

268
00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.690
this is in a paper that's where the lead

269
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.250
author is, Jonathan Phillips is that the more basic

270
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.260
thing is knowledge. And in that way, we're sort

271
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.010
of going against what a lot of cognitive scientists

272
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.969
have traditionally thought like that. A lot of cognitive

273
00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:31.880
scientists traditionally thought if you want to understand basically

274
00:13:32.989 --> 00:13:35.700
how I make sense of your mind, the most

275
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.450
basic thing to understand is how I figure out

276
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.770
what you think. And then our suggestion is people

277
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.849
can figure out what you think, but that's not

278
00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:47.429
the thing they're using most generally. Maybe they use

279
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.729
that in cases where something weird is happening. And

280
00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:51.950
so they can't use their more basic approach and

281
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.369
the more basic approach is to figure out what,

282
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.869
you know. So I don't know if this will

283
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.869
be a helpful example. But um, I, if we're

284
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.049
going to your home and we're just walking on

285
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.880
the street, I immediately have this sense that, you

286
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.289
know, where your home is and then my ability

287
00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:12.109
to think about the fact that you know, where

288
00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:13.359
your home is. So we're gonna go to the

289
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:15.960
right place, doesn't rely in any way on my

290
00:14:15.969 --> 00:14:21.140
ability to attribute beliefs to you, right?

291
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.169
So, uh uh and le let's now talk a

292
00:14:24.179 --> 00:14:28.900
little bit about uh causal judgments and norm violations

293
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:32.679
because you've done some work on that. So do

294
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.679
norm violations interact with causal judgments. And if so

295
00:14:37.729 --> 00:14:41.789
how, yeah, so a lot of studies show that

296
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.830
um when you're judging whether one thing caused another

297
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.789
thing, then people tend to think that people's judgments

298
00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:50.640
about whether this cause that depend on whether they

299
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.609
think that this thing is right or wrong or

300
00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:54.659
good or bad. So you, I'll just give an

301
00:14:54.669 --> 00:14:58.559
example to explain it. So imagine that you're in

302
00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:01.820
the philosophy department and the receptionist has a, has

303
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.809
some pens on her desk. So now, um the

304
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.650
there are like two pens on her desk and

305
00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:11.380
the rule of the department is that administrative assistants

306
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.059
are allowed to take the pens, but professors are

307
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.580
not supposed to take pens from the desk, they're

308
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.770
just supposed to bring their own pens. So I

309
00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:21.280
mentioned one day the administrative assistant and Professor Smith

310
00:15:21.289 --> 00:15:24.039
are walking by the desk and they just each

311
00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:27.020
take a pen. So the administrative assistant takes a

312
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.349
pen just like she's supposed to. And Professor Smith

313
00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:31.359
also takes a pen even though she's totally not

314
00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:33.710
supposed to and she's just completely violating this rule.

315
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:37.549
Now, after they've both done that, um, there's no

316
00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:40.359
pens on the desk. And so when the receptionist

317
00:15:40.369 --> 00:15:41.570
gets a call, she has a problem, she has

318
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.530
no pen to like, take down the message to

319
00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:48.239
know who caused the problem. In that case, participants

320
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.659
overwhelmingly to say that the recept that the Professor

321
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:53.280
Smith caused the problem, but the administrative assistant did

322
00:15:53.289 --> 00:15:56.690
not cause the problem. And then in that case,

323
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.979
they're making a causal judgment. They're just judging whether

324
00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:01.549
one thing caused another, but their judgment about whether

325
00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:04.109
something caused something else seems to be shaped in

326
00:16:04.119 --> 00:16:06.640
some way by their judgments of which things are

327
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.000
right or wrong to do. And then over the

328
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.900
past few years, we've been doing all these different

329
00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:14.030
kinds of research to explain why that's happened

330
00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:18.390
and why does that happen?

331
00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:21.239
Well, there are a number of different theories and

332
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.969
um it could turn out that our theory is

333
00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:25.809
wrong, but the theory that we adopt is that

334
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.909
it depends is that people's moral judgments are shaping

335
00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:34.770
which possibilities they think of. So in the case

336
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.260
that I just described what happened in the actual

337
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.590
world was that the administrative assistant took a pen

338
00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:42.090
and Professor Smith took a pen. But you could

339
00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:45.429
imagine other possibilities, what we call counter factuals. You

340
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.510
could just imagine other things that could have happened.

341
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.950
So one thing you could imagine is the administrative

342
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.169
assistant could have just not taken a pen, even

343
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.190
though there was no reason for her to do

344
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.869
that. And the professor could have taken a pen.

345
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.630
And then in that case, the problem wouldn't have

346
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.789
occurred. But you would tend not to think about

347
00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:05.339
that possibility because why would the administrative system of

348
00:17:05.348 --> 00:17:07.939
not taking that? And then another possibility you could

349
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:10.380
consider is, for example, the administrative system takes a

350
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.209
pen and the professor doesn't take a pen. In

351
00:17:13.219 --> 00:17:17.208
that case, also, the problem wouldn't have occurred, but

352
00:17:17.218 --> 00:17:19.648
there's just a much higher probability that you think

353
00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:22.348
of that possibility, the possibility in which people do

354
00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:25.510
what they're supposed to do. And so we developed

355
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.770
this theory according to that, which is science probabilities

356
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.119
to different thoughts. So if you mentioned different things,

357
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.030
you could possibly think, then there's a probability of

358
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.880
thinking certain things and a probability of other thinking

359
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.770
other things and they're different, there are different potential

360
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.089
probabilities and then the degree to which you end

361
00:17:43.099 --> 00:17:46.369
up regarding certain things as causes can be defined

362
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.239
in it mathematically in terms of those probabilities. So

363
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.449
in the case that I just told you given

364
00:17:51.459 --> 00:17:53.959
the exact way it works because there was a

365
00:17:53.969 --> 00:17:56.739
higher probability of thinking about cases in which the

366
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.199
professor doesn't take a pen and in the case

367
00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:00.209
in which the administrative assistant doesn't take a pen,

368
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.530
you would more say the professor across the public.

369
00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:04.939
Mhm. Uh,

370
00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:08.619
SO, uh, we're going to talk more about the

371
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.180
work you've been doing on, uh, how morality and

372
00:18:13.189 --> 00:18:17.819
moral appraisals affect or at least influence how we

373
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:21.319
think. Uh, BUT, uh, I, I mean, let me

374
00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:25.459
ask you another question to introduce a topic that

375
00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:28.819
also we sort of related to that. So people

376
00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:33.089
have this idea or concept of the true self.

377
00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:36.599
So, what is that? What does that mean? Exactly.

378
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.329
Oh, yeah, it's a, it's a really good question.

379
00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:42.689
Try to understand what it really is. So there's

380
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:44.530
a very straightforward sense of which it seems like

381
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.510
people have it though. Like, so for example, um,

382
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.359
suppose that, uh, you are faced with this conflict,

383
00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:55.569
which is that you want to have, you, you're,

384
00:18:55.579 --> 00:18:57.729
um, addicted to heroin and you want to have

385
00:18:57.739 --> 00:19:00.979
some heroin, but also at the very time you

386
00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:03.339
want to get clean and then there's this conflict

387
00:19:03.349 --> 00:19:07.099
between you. Now suppose you end up yielding to

388
00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:09.989
the temptation to do more heroin and then you

389
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.239
abandon the desire to get clean. A lot of

390
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.030
people would think that decision that you did chose,

391
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.500
it doesn't reflect what you really want deep down

392
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.359
inside something like you're betraying your true self. And

393
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.250
then by contrast, if you chose the opposite option,

394
00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:28.530
if you said I'm going to, um, uh, just

395
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.430
not do this heroin, I'm gonna get clean and

396
00:19:30.439 --> 00:19:32.140
I get a jug and I get back with,

397
00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:34.430
if you did that, no one would say you're

398
00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.939
betraying your true self because deep down inside what

399
00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:38.739
you really wanted to do was to have no

400
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.439
heroin. So in that case, people have a very

401
00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:44.839
clear intuition about which one is the thing that

402
00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:47.180
your true self is calling you to it. And

403
00:19:47.189 --> 00:19:49.449
then there's a much more difficult question, which is

404
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.209
what does that mean? Like what, what is it

405
00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:54.400
that makes us think that one is the one

406
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.530
that's your true self,

407
00:19:55.849 --> 00:19:59.180
right? Uh And I, and I mean, is it

408
00:19:59.189 --> 00:20:03.099
that there are any universals when it comes to

409
00:20:03.109 --> 00:20:06.489
how people think about the true self?

410
00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:10.319
Well, we do find actually that there's something strikingly

411
00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:13.119
systematic that you see across many different people and

412
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.239
many different cultures. And that is that when there's

413
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.130
a conflict between two different things. So part of

414
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.979
you is drawn toward one thing and part of

415
00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:22.859
you is drawn to the other people show a

416
00:20:22.869 --> 00:20:26.439
very striking tendency to think that the one person

417
00:20:26.449 --> 00:20:29.560
you really are deep down inside the real you

418
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.099
is the thing that's to the thing that they

419
00:20:32.109 --> 00:20:34.660
think is good. So in the case that I

420
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.550
just described, if you think that during heroin is

421
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.839
bad, you'd be less likely to think that that's,

422
00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:43.079
that your real self. So if different people have

423
00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:46.829
totally opposite views about what is good, then those

424
00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:49.719
different people will have totally opposite views about who

425
00:20:49.729 --> 00:20:52.750
you really are deep down inside. Like if, if

426
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.250
you're caught between A and B and some people

427
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.680
think A is the good thing and some people

428
00:20:56.689 --> 00:20:58.510
think B is the good thing, the people who

429
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.699
think A is the good thing will say deep

430
00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:03.520
down inside the real Ricardo is struggling toward A

431
00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:05.420
and the other people who think B is the

432
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.239
good thing will think deep down in his true

433
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.319
self. The real Ricardo is the thing that's been

434
00:21:10.329 --> 00:21:11.420
drawing him to be.

435
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.689
And what about the misanthrope specifically? Do they also

436
00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:23.310
think that the true self is uh is good

437
00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.069
or not?

438
00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:28.290
Yeah. So some people have this tendency that they

439
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.060
think people are bad. So if you just ask

440
00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:33.939
them on um explicit questions, like, do you agree

441
00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:35.680
with the following statement? You just can't really trust

442
00:21:35.689 --> 00:21:38.239
people, they're gonna do bad stuff to you, then

443
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.689
they say, yeah, people are terrible. So now the

444
00:21:42.699 --> 00:21:44.819
question is they still think that the true self

445
00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:48.800
is good. So in um some research that was

446
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.369
led by Julian Deres, we, we looked at that

447
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.680
question and what we did was um we told,

448
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:57.030
told participants about a story about someone who's caught

449
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.030
between two things. So they have a desire to

450
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.890
do the morally good thing and they have a

451
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.199
desire to do the morally bad thing. And then

452
00:22:03.209 --> 00:22:05.770
participants were randomly assigned to one of two questions.

453
00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:10.449
So one question is given that people are copying

454
00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:13.010
these two things. Which one do you predict they'll

455
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.699
actually do if someone's copying these two things, you

456
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.449
know, what do you think he's gonna do? And

457
00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:20.040
then it's pretty unsurprising the people who are very

458
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.619
low in misanthropy say he's gonna do the good

459
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.339
thing. And the people who are high in misanthropy

460
00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:26.829
say he's gonna do the bad thing. But then

461
00:22:26.969 --> 00:22:30.199
by contrast, we say, um OK, there are these

462
00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:32.260
two things I'm not asking you which one he's

463
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.260
gonna do. I'm asking you which one is his

464
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.089
true self. Then the people who are low in

465
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:39.869
misanthropy and the people who are high in misanthropy

466
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.089
both say the true self is the one drawing

467
00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:47.349
him toward what's good. So misanthropes think you're, they,

468
00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:49.859
they still think deep down you're good. They just

469
00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.780
think you're not gonna do the thing that your

470
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.250
true self is calling you to do.

471
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.489
But do we know why? That's the case? I

472
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.239
mean, why, even though they still think that the

473
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.660
true self is good, uh they don't expect that

474
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.699
people will behave in a good way. Why is

475
00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:10.030
that?

476
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.709
That's really fascinating question. And it really gets to

477
00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:16.670
a deep question of what this thing even is

478
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.599
like, what, what is it to say that someone

479
00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:22.040
has a true self. It doesn't seem to be

480
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.150
something that we're using to predict what they're actually

481
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.900
going to do. It seems to be something else.

482
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.859
I think maybe this won't answer your question, but

483
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:33.959
maybe just to give a sense of what this

484
00:23:33.969 --> 00:23:35.489
judgment is, it would be helpful to give an

485
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.880
example one of our studies. So this is a

486
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.280
study that was led by George Newman. And in

487
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.400
this study, participants were told about this guy Mark

488
00:23:43.459 --> 00:23:46.119
and there were two different conditions in one condition.

489
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:50.930
Participants were told Mark as an evangelical preacher and

490
00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:53.770
he travels around the world brings people this message

491
00:23:53.949 --> 00:23:56.890
that homosexuality is a sin and you can be

492
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.410
redeemed from that sin through the power of Jesus.

493
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.859
If you pray, you can like rid yourself of

494
00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:05.420
homosexuality. And then marcus' problem, which is that he

495
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.239
himself is actually gay. And so he himself is

496
00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.939
really drawn to other men. And then he describes

497
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.719
this in his speeches and acknowledges it as part

498
00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:15.920
of his own personal struggle. So there's a struggle

499
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.920
within Mark. Um He has desire to be with

500
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.150
other man and he's a belief that it's morally

501
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.280
wrong. So which part is his true self? In

502
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.880
that case, I just described liberal participants to tend

503
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.180
to say Marx, true yourself is the part that

504
00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:33.369
um is being drawn to other men. And the

505
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.020
conservatives tend to say Mars yourself is the part

506
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.910
that believes that it's morally wrong. I know if

507
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.319
you can kind of feel that intuitively. But now

508
00:24:40.329 --> 00:24:42.939
suppose we switch it. So now we're gonna say

509
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:44.959
America is this person who travels all around the

510
00:24:44.969 --> 00:24:48.430
world, bringing to people this message that people of

511
00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:51.979
all sexual orientations should be treated equally. And then

512
00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:54.900
he teaches people techniques that they can use to

513
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.569
treat gay people with respect. But Mark himself has

514
00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:00.640
a problem and the problem is that he himself

515
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.109
finds himself feeling disgusted by gay people. And then

516
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.239
he acknowledges this fully and just recognized it as

517
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.339
a part of his own personal struggle. So now

518
00:25:09.349 --> 00:25:12.790
again, his emotions and his moral beliefs are are

519
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.949
out of um fighting against each other, but now

520
00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:18.550
in the opposite direction. So this time, which do

521
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.089
people think it's, is his true self? Here, it's

522
00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:23.920
reversed. The liberals tend to say is more a

523
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.229
belief that you should treat people with all sexual

524
00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:28.469
orientations equally. That's his true self. If you could

525
00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:30.719
just get rid of this disgust, then he'd be

526
00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.510
able to more fully express the person, he was

527
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.910
all alone. And then the conservatives tend to say

528
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.910
that emotion of disgust, that is his true self.

529
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.099
And if you could get rid of the moral

530
00:25:40.109 --> 00:25:41.829
belief, then you'd be able to express the person

531
00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:44.430
he really is all about. So now we face

532
00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.180
this question, which is the question that you just

533
00:25:46.189 --> 00:25:48.979
posed, you know, how do we make sense of

534
00:25:48.989 --> 00:25:52.040
what this thing is? It doesn't seem to be

535
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.150
something that people are using to predict what Mark

536
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.500
is going to do. It seems to be playing

537
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.339
some other role in their way of thinking about

538
00:25:58.349 --> 00:25:59.380
who Mark really is.

539
00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:07.500
But then, uh, people's own moral values influence how

540
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.390
they think about the true self. And what they

541
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.069
say is the true self of someone they are

542
00:26:16.189 --> 00:26:17.130
evaluating.

543
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:23.300
Yeah, exactly. And people's moral beliefs affect that and

544
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.260
then it doesn't seem to be that they only

545
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.780
affects judgments about the true self, let's say of

546
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.400
a human being, they seem to also affect judgments

547
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.359
about the essence of other things other than human

548
00:26:32.369 --> 00:26:36.160
beings. So say, there's some band you like and

549
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.270
now suppose the band has different albums over time.

550
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.780
See, their first album was really amazing. And then

551
00:26:42.829 --> 00:26:45.500
by the third album they've, like, totally sold out

552
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.420
and then the, the band is just like, doing

553
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.709
some, like, corporate schlock to sell more records. Yeah.

554
00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:55.060
I thought you could ask the question, like all

555
00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:58.699
those different albums, which one reflects, like what this

556
00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:01.030
band is really all about. Like the true essence

557
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.219
of this band. Then you get the same effect

558
00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:07.760
that people say, whichever is the best one that's

559
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.170
what affects like the real essence of the band.

560
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.300
No one ever thinks, um, the schlocky corporate stuff.

561
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.479
That's what the band was really all about. And

562
00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:18.369
then they were betraying their true essence in their

563
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.589
first album when they created this amazing music, we're

564
00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:23.380
supposed to think about the essence of the United

565
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.959
States. So the United States has done various different

566
00:27:26.969 --> 00:27:30.680
things. For example, there's maybe a lot of freedom,

567
00:27:30.689 --> 00:27:33.079
but there's also a lot of racism. And then

568
00:27:33.089 --> 00:27:35.079
you might ask the question, you know, what's the

569
00:27:35.089 --> 00:27:37.219
real essence of the United States? What's the United

570
00:27:37.229 --> 00:27:39.739
States really all about? And then different people have

571
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.729
different views about which things about the United States

572
00:27:41.739 --> 00:27:43.199
are the good ones and which are the bad

573
00:27:43.209 --> 00:27:46.670
ones. But people seem to think whichever is the

574
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.209
good thing about the United States. That's what the

575
00:27:49.219 --> 00:27:52.739
United States is really all about. So this thing

576
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.849
that we see for judgments about the true self,

577
00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.589
it seems like it arises for judgments about the

578
00:27:57.599 --> 00:27:59.829
self, arises for like what you are really all

579
00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:02.349
about, but not just because you're because of you,

580
00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:06.160
because you're a human being, it also arises for

581
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.979
nations, for bands, for all sorts of different things.

582
00:28:09.989 --> 00:28:12.609
Like if I write a philosophy paper and it

583
00:28:12.619 --> 00:28:14.650
has different sections and some are good and some

584
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.329
are bad, whichever section you think is the good

585
00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:19.699
one, you'll think that's the real heart of what

586
00:28:19.709 --> 00:28:20.979
my paper is really all about.

587
00:28:22.969 --> 00:28:25.770
And, uh, I mean, I asked you if uh

588
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.939
moral beliefs influence the way people think about the

589
00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:34.530
true self of a particular somebody. So, but uh,

590
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.920
does it work also the other way around? I

591
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.400
mean, do beliefs about the true self influence moral

592
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.010
judgment. That's

593
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.079
a great question. We, we have some evidence in

594
00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:49.949
recent work with Michael printing that seems to suggest

595
00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:53.739
that, that they do. So, the basic idea would

596
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:59.680
be, um, suppose, for example, that, um someone is,

597
00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:03.030
um, he's caught between two different kind of romantic

598
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.020
interests like a woman is trying to choose between

599
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.069
two different men. And then suppose you learn, she's

600
00:29:09.079 --> 00:29:10.829
drawn to one and she's also drawn to the

601
00:29:10.839 --> 00:29:14.069
other, but deep down in her truest heart, she's

602
00:29:14.079 --> 00:29:15.790
more drawn to this one and less to that

603
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.780
one that makes people think that this one is

604
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.770
actually the good person that people think the thing

605
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.520
that your true self is drawing you toward. Probably

606
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:32.290
that thing is good. And it feels like a,

607
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.050
like a really fundamental kind of heuristic that people

608
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.439
use sometimes in their own decision making that, that

609
00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:42.030
when they're trying to figure out what's right, they

610
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.489
seem to be drawn to the thought that whatever

611
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.079
their truest deepest self is pulling them toward, that

612
00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:52.420
must really be the right thing. Mhm.

613
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.750
And I mean, do judgments moral judgments regarding uh

614
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.359
the goodness or the badness of someone's behavior, have

615
00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:07.449
any influence in how we think about them being

616
00:30:07.459 --> 00:30:11.890
happy or not, or if they deserve praise or

617
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.010
blame, that is uh thinking about a particular agent's

618
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.839
behavior in moral terms, also influence how we think

619
00:30:19.849 --> 00:30:24.829
about it in terms of some other psychological dimensions

620
00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:28.560
like happiness, praise blame. And so on,

621
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:32.619
we, we get these very strong effects for happiness.

622
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.849
So an obvious thought you might have about what

623
00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:37.020
it is to be happy. Is it being happy?

624
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.880
It just means feeling really good all the time,

625
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.239
not feeling bad. And I don't know, thinking your

626
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.630
life is going well, this is about his mental

627
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.260
states that you have. But for some reason, we're

628
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.300
finding that people's moral judgments affect whether you see

629
00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:54.430
someone's happy or not. So imagine two different cases.

630
00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:58.079
So imagine this person who feels really good all

631
00:30:58.089 --> 00:30:59.920
the time, doesn't feel bad and thinks her life

632
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.849
is going great. And the reason is she's like

633
00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:05.780
a high school student who is um really uh

634
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.359
has close friends in her high school and is

635
00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:11.619
like working to help the disadvantaged, like on her

636
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.489
spare time and it's a good relationship with her

637
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.260
parents and so forth. Then people think she's truly

638
00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.489
happy but not consider a different person I met

639
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.569
with someone who's more like Regina George, the character

640
00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:25.079
from mean girls. So she feels really good and

641
00:31:25.089 --> 00:31:26.630
she doesn't feel bad and she thinks her life

642
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.099
is going great. And the reason is because she's

643
00:31:29.109 --> 00:31:32.380
the most popular kid in the class. And whenever

644
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.500
anyone else tries to challenge her or something, she

645
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.270
just like insults them and demeans them and just

646
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.949
dominates everyone. She has no real friends, no real

647
00:31:40.959 --> 00:31:43.630
interests doesn't really care about anything. And it's just

648
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.699
trying to like, get to the top of this

649
00:31:45.709 --> 00:31:49.900
popularity contest, then people feel when you give that

650
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.380
case a little, I much more torn about whether

651
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.040
the person is happy. So a lot of people

652
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.989
seem to have this feeling like, well, there's clearly

653
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.640
a sense in which she's happy. You just said

654
00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.239
she feels good. But on the other hand, they

655
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.319
feel like no, but there's some deeper sense of

656
00:32:02.329 --> 00:32:04.650
when she doesn't feel happy at all in some

657
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.000
sense, what she has is not true happiness where

658
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.099
true happiness seems to be something that you can

659
00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:12.760
laugh even if you're feeling pretty great.

660
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.729
Uh But uh I mean, when it comes to

661
00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:23.349
happiness, this is, I guess a complicated concept, isn't

662
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:27.329
it the case that conceptions of happiness vary cross

663
00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:28.060
culturally.

664
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.310
We don't find that in the studies that we've

665
00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:35.560
done. So you work with Yang, we um why

666
00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:38.569
we and she translated all of this into Chinese

667
00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:42.290
and then just ran all these cases in um

668
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.760
in China with Chinese people. And then we find

669
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.849
exactly the same thing arising that people say the

670
00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:53.410
person who's morally bad isn't really happy. And then,

671
00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:58.459
and then tried it with Children. So um if

672
00:32:58.469 --> 00:33:00.500
you imagine like just asking the same kind of

673
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.500
question to a four year old, and then we

674
00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.010
find again the same thing, Children also show the

675
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.469
same effect. So overall, it seems like what, what's

676
00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:13.300
going on is that this effect seems to be

677
00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:15.930
not something that's just arising I don't know because

678
00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:18.390
of certain weird idiosyncrasies of what's going on in

679
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.359
western culture, in the 20 twenties. It's something that

680
00:33:22.229 --> 00:33:24.439
is in very young Children before they've had the

681
00:33:24.449 --> 00:33:26.640
chance to kind of learn all the subtleties of

682
00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.050
exactly how words are used. And it's something that

683
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.510
arises across very different cultures. It's a very good

684
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.680
question why it's happening, but it doesn't seem to

685
00:33:35.689 --> 00:33:38.359
be happening because it's something more like about, um

686
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.640
kind of just uh certain books we happen to

687
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.729
have read or certain ways we happen to use

688
00:33:43.739 --> 00:33:44.489
this one word.

689
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.739
Uh And I, I would like to ask you

690
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:53.780
now about uh folk morality. Do, do people, for

691
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.180
example, tend to believe in objective moral truths?

692
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.030
Yeah, that's a great question. So in, in philosophy,

693
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.599
there's been a really long and profound question uh

694
00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:10.610
inquiry into the question are their moral truths objective?

695
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.560
Could there really be a fact of the matter

696
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.899
about some moral question? And within philosophy, there's some

697
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.360
people who think the answer is yes and some

698
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.040
people who think the answer is no. But typically

699
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.389
people on both sides of that dispute say that

700
00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:26.610
ordinary folks think the answer is definitely yes. So

701
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.239
the people who say that the answer is yes,

702
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.610
they were defending the ordinary view and the people

703
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.219
who say the answer is no, say the ordinary

704
00:34:33.228 --> 00:34:35.429
view is wrong. There aren't objective well truths in

705
00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:37.947
the way people think they ordinarily are. But why

706
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:40.579
do people say that just try asking a few

707
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:44.299
people around you. And you'll find immediately that people

708
00:34:44.309 --> 00:34:47.579
don't always say that their objective moral is pe

709
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:50.029
different people you ask will give you different answers

710
00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:52.358
and different questions, the ways of asking the question

711
00:34:52.858 --> 00:34:55.188
will give you different answers. It seems like what's

712
00:34:55.197 --> 00:34:57.448
happening and you could see this. I think immediately

713
00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.648
if you just asked a few friends is that

714
00:34:59.928 --> 00:35:03.419
people regard this as a confusing question that they

715
00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:06.389
think it's a difficult question to answer and they're

716
00:35:06.399 --> 00:35:09.469
kind of drawn in competing directions. So we ran

717
00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:11.649
a whole series of studies and that's what they

718
00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:15.020
seem to show that um people are confused about

719
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.010
this. It's like difficult and de depending on various

720
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.290
things that you do, you can kind of push

721
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.820
people in very different directions.

722
00:35:22.449 --> 00:35:25.209
But uh I, I mean, o of course, I

723
00:35:25.219 --> 00:35:28.199
don't know if you controlled for these in those

724
00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:32.860
studies but uh the way people think about morality

725
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.939
and moral proofs as being objective or not, this,

726
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:39.330
is it influence or do you know if it's

727
00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:45.070
influenced in any way by uh political beliefs? For

728
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.870
example, I mean, beca because the there's this, sometimes

729
00:35:48.879 --> 00:35:54.280
we hear this idea that uh conservative people when

730
00:35:54.290 --> 00:36:00.659
compared to liberal people would believe more in objective

731
00:36:00.669 --> 00:36:04.159
moral truths. But I, I don't know if that

732
00:36:04.169 --> 00:36:09.770
has any scientific or experimental philosophical support to it

733
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:09.979
or

734
00:36:09.989 --> 00:36:13.439
not. Yeah, that is true. So in studies by

735
00:36:13.449 --> 00:36:15.340
this is not my own work. But in studies

736
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:19.899
by Louis SS, he finds this correlation that more

737
00:36:19.909 --> 00:36:23.750
conservative people more believe in objective moral truths and

738
00:36:23.879 --> 00:36:26.600
more liberal people less believe in objective moral truths.

739
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.159
So that's just a correlation. It doesn't mean that

740
00:36:31.169 --> 00:36:35.760
the political beliefs are affecting the, um, the beliefs

741
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.639
about the nature of normality. It could be a

742
00:36:37.649 --> 00:36:39.620
different way where there's some deeper fact about a

743
00:36:39.629 --> 00:36:42.620
person and that affects your political beliefs and it

744
00:36:42.629 --> 00:36:45.530
also just affects your beliefs about morality. But in

745
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.570
any case, you're totally right, though different people with

746
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.459
different political beliefs tend to have different beliefs about

747
00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:52.760
whether they're objective morals.

748
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.570
Uh, AND so, but when it comes to moral

749
00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.459
relativism, do we have any idea about how prevalent

750
00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:06.820
it is among people and, uh, across different cultures?

751
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.050
I mean, is it that it's very common or

752
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:14.860
not? Yes. So in studies to address this question,

753
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:18.850
we try, um, uh, to test whether people are

754
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.379
moral relatives by giving them the, the following kind

755
00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:24.010
of cases. So they're gonna be three different conditions.

756
00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.439
And so imagine there's some person in, I don't

757
00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:29.699
know, New Jersey and this person does something like,

758
00:37:29.709 --> 00:37:33.320
for example, he murders his own child. And now

759
00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:36.320
suppose that you say that what he did was

760
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.600
morally wrong. And then I say what he did

761
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.379
is totally fine. And then participants are asked the

762
00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:44.080
question given that Ricardo and Josh said, opposite things

763
00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.399
about this does one of them have to be

764
00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:48.270
wrong, Ricardo or Josh or could it be that

765
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.669
neither of them is wrong? And then in that

766
00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:53.419
case, participants overwhelmingly say one of us has to

767
00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:56.570
be wrong. Ok. Now consider a different case, suppose

768
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.659
there's discrepancies in New Jersey, then he murders his

769
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:05.340
own child. And then I say that, um, what

770
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.280
that, what he did is morally wrong. And then

771
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.399
there's someone else in a completely different culture, say

772
00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:11.639
this is the hunter gatherer living in the Amazon.

773
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.659
And then that person says what this person did

774
00:38:14.669 --> 00:38:17.770
isn't wrong at all. It's totally fine. Then given

775
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.419
that I said this thing and this other person

776
00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:21.629
from his other cultures said the opposite. Does one

777
00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:22.810
of us have to be wrong? Or could we

778
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.020
both be right on that case, people are right

779
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.979
about at the midpoint of the scale. So in

780
00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:32.639
that case, participants don't say definitely one of you

781
00:38:32.649 --> 00:38:35.120
has to be wrong or definitely could be that

782
00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:36.770
you're neither of you is wrong. They're kind of

783
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.520
like neither here nor there. Now consider a third

784
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.659
condition. That's like an even more distinct culture. So

785
00:38:42.669 --> 00:38:46.080
ma that there are these extraterrestrial beings, they're called

786
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.020
the PS and the P tars don't have any

787
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.469
of the interest that we have. They're not, they

788
00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:53.800
don't care about like love and friendship and like

789
00:38:53.969 --> 00:38:56.520
um helping others. None of that, all they care

790
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.939
about is maximizing the total number of Pentagons in

791
00:38:58.949 --> 00:39:01.389
the universe. And then, for example, if one of

792
00:39:01.399 --> 00:39:04.050
them becomes too old and tired and sick to

793
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.330
accomplish this task, they just kill that and just

794
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.649
turn him into a Pentagon and then none of

795
00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:11.520
them see anything wrong with that. No, I mentioned

796
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.139
that this person in New Jersey kills his own

797
00:39:13.149 --> 00:39:16.189
child and I say that's really morally bad. And

798
00:39:16.199 --> 00:39:18.120
one of the panthers says, no, it's totally fine.

799
00:39:18.129 --> 00:39:20.760
There's nothing bad about it at all. Then in

800
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.199
that case, does one of us have to be

801
00:39:22.209 --> 00:39:24.270
wrong me or the Panther or could it be

802
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.280
that neither of us is wrong in that kind

803
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.300
of case, participants tend to say neither of you

804
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:32.070
has to be wrong. So it's a little bit

805
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.469
unclear what to make of this and different um

806
00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:37.030
philosophers have had very different thoughts about it, but

807
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.550
it seems to at least suggest there, there's something

808
00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.790
that draws us toward thinking in a relativist way

809
00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:47.239
as we start thinking about um judges who are

810
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.330
more and more different from each other. Mhm.

811
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.169
Uh So it seems that also that uh people

812
00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:59.570
consistently make sense of moral events in terms of

813
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.409
agents and patients do, do we know why? That's

814
00:40:04.419 --> 00:40:05.080
the case?

815
00:40:06.139 --> 00:40:09.459
So right there, there's really important work, not, not

816
00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:14.080
by me, that's indicating it a really fundamental aspect

817
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.090
of how people think about moral situations is that

818
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.189
there is kind of true rules, there's the role

819
00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:22.169
of the agent and the role of the patient

820
00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:27.360
So I don't know if um if the Russian

821
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.639
army killed some innocent people in a Ukrainian town,

822
00:40:31.649 --> 00:40:33.409
then the Russian army would be the agent and

823
00:40:33.419 --> 00:40:34.760
the innocent people who got killed will be the

824
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.489
patient. And then uh research on this topic has

825
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.330
explored these two rules, these fundamental rules and morality

826
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.030
and uh how things like that work. Like, for

827
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.969
example, some research seems to suggest that it's very

828
00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:50.350
hard to see someone as occupying bulls ws like

829
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.250
in two different events. They, they would be hard

830
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.689
in the case. I just described to think that

831
00:40:54.699 --> 00:40:57.290
for example, the um people would tend not to

832
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.969
think that those people were the victims of the

833
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:02.580
Russian army, but also they themselves are perpetrators who

834
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.459
harm other people within their towns, right? So then

835
00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:09.580
the question arises, why does morality work like that?

836
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.580
Why do we have these two fundamental rules? And

837
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.350
one possible answer you could give is that it's

838
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.570
just because it's something about morality, morality is like

839
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.239
that. But at least what we suggested was may,

840
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.300
maybe it's not, maybe the reason that things work

841
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.949
that way is because it's something much more general

842
00:41:25.959 --> 00:41:29.709
about human cognition, how the human mind works. There

843
00:41:30.679 --> 00:41:33.379
people tend to think about agents and patients or

844
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.209
sometimes they're called agents and themes in general. And

845
00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:39.639
some evidence from that comes from like the structure

846
00:41:39.649 --> 00:41:43.439
of human language that if you think about um

847
00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:45.679
which thing goes in the subject position of a

848
00:41:45.689 --> 00:41:47.459
sentence and which thing goes in the object position

849
00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:50.969
of the sentence? It it's, it's not random. It

850
00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:53.300
always seems to be the agent and the patient.

851
00:41:53.419 --> 00:41:55.199
So just to give you a sense of what

852
00:41:55.209 --> 00:41:57.610
I mean, you know how we have the word,

853
00:41:57.739 --> 00:42:02.500
for example. Um Great. So you couldn't say like

854
00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.179
I broke his bone and that would mean like

855
00:42:05.399 --> 00:42:07.500
that I was the one who caused the bone

856
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.429
to break or like John broke Fred's bone or

857
00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:12.770
we could have like um hurt like John hurt

858
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.060
Fred. But no, I imagine we tried to create

859
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.219
a verb that's like the reverse of hurt. It's

860
00:42:17.229 --> 00:42:21.560
called a Schmidt. And then John Schmidt uh Fred

861
00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.689
Schmit did um John just means the same thing

862
00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:27.639
as John hurt. Fred that no language has a

863
00:42:27.649 --> 00:42:29.739
word that works like that and you can kind

864
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.060
of feel it immediately like that we could never

865
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.739
have that, that verb could never exist. So it

866
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:40.169
feels like there's this very basic connection we have

867
00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:42.550
uh idea we have about agency and patient is

868
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.050
such that we're always gonna put the agent and

869
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.199
subject position and the patient or in this is

870
00:42:47.209 --> 00:42:49.919
sometimes called the theme in the object position.

871
00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:54.439
Mhm uh And since we're talking here about uh

872
00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:59.780
folk philosophy, what tend to be people's ideas about

873
00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.399
free will, I mean, is the belief in free

874
00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:04.580
will, a human universal.

875
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:08.610
Well, it, it, it's really interesting that what you

876
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.429
find if you ask people in the United States

877
00:43:10.439 --> 00:43:12.840
about free, well, like say we just looked around

878
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:17.929
here is that people find it confusing. So um

879
00:43:17.939 --> 00:43:22.010
if you ask like folks right around here, if

880
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.330
I ask them certain kinds of questions, what I

881
00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.689
get is that people would immediately recognize that that's

882
00:43:27.699 --> 00:43:29.639
like a really confusing question and then they're like

883
00:43:29.649 --> 00:43:32.100
torn in different directions. Some people would say one

884
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.040
thing, some people say another thing, a lot of

885
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.989
people would just openly admit that that's like a

886
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.239
really hard problem. So that like you said about

887
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:43.560
universality, a really question now is um is is

888
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.070
why why do people find it confusing around here?

889
00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:50.129
And when I was um first starting to work

890
00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:53.090
on this issue, uh what I thought the answer

891
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.320
was is that it's due in part certain very

892
00:43:56.330 --> 00:44:00.629
specific kind of talks about Western culture that make

893
00:44:00.639 --> 00:44:02.790
us find it confusing. But also, I mean, people

894
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.429
in Western culture and then, and then I was

895
00:44:06.439 --> 00:44:10.989
totally wrong. So I um started researching this topic

896
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.510
with um my colleague Sean Nichols who had the

897
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.969
opposite guess about what was right? And I just

898
00:44:15.979 --> 00:44:19.070
got completely owned it is in no way. Did

899
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.750
that turn out to be true? What happened instead

900
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.129
was that this kind of intuition that we, these

901
00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:27.399
kind of intuitions that we have in in Western

902
00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:29.350
culture that are pulling us in opposite directions and

903
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.959
confusing us and making the question seem like a

904
00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:36.639
really puzzling one those arise really universally. So in

905
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.219
in a beautiful recent study where the first author

906
00:44:39.229 --> 00:44:42.689
was Ivar Henkin, um participants were recruited from all

907
00:44:42.699 --> 00:44:45.540
different places across the world and given questions about

908
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.719
free will. And if you look at the Western

909
00:44:47.729 --> 00:44:49.120
culture, what you find is that people are very

910
00:44:49.129 --> 00:44:50.909
divided. Some people say one thing, some people say

911
00:44:50.919 --> 00:44:53.550
the other, it's obviously a really confusing question. And

912
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.469
then that exact same confusion arose in every world

913
00:44:57.479 --> 00:44:59.780
region that they looked at every different continent showed

914
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.659
the same confusion with the same kind of percentage

915
00:45:02.669 --> 00:45:04.219
of people saying one thing and saying the other

916
00:45:04.229 --> 00:45:08.679
thing. So it's really like this feeling we have

917
00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:12.239
that but it's confusing that it's puzzling that there's

918
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.699
something going wrong when we think about free will.

919
00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.699
It's not because of something about our weird culture.

920
00:45:19.879 --> 00:45:23.250
It's because of something about human way of understanding

921
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:23.780
action.

922
00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:28.459
But I I mean when you mentioned there that

923
00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:32.340
uh when you ask people certain questions, you get

924
00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:35.439
the sense that they are a bit confused about

925
00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:39.060
free will. Could you give us examples of some

926
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.350
of those questions just for us to get a

927
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.260
better sense of what we're talking about here?

928
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.250
Absolutely. So in one of the early studies we

929
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.820
did about this, we were interested in the question,

930
00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.209
what do people think when I think about this

931
00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:56.199
kind of question abstractly just like theoretically? And what

932
00:45:56.209 --> 00:45:57.449
did you think about this question? And the thing

933
00:45:57.469 --> 00:46:01.570
about individual cases with individual behaviors. OK. So to

934
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.739
address this question, we told people about this imaginary

935
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.260
universe, we called it universe a and we said

936
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.840
like, OK, imagine in this, this imaginary universe is

937
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.979
totally deterministic. So what that means is everything that

938
00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:14.550
happens was completely caused by the thing that happened

939
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.070
before, which was completely caused by the thing that

940
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.169
happened before that it's clearly caused by the thing

941
00:46:19.179 --> 00:46:21.070
that happened before that all the way back to

942
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.989
the very beginning of the universe. So if you

943
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.770
consider how things were, you know, one second after

944
00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.659
the universe first began, that completely caused the thing

945
00:46:28.669 --> 00:46:30.489
that would happen next and next and next. So

946
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.409
that given the way things were at the very

947
00:46:32.419 --> 00:46:34.570
beginning of the universe and given the laws of

948
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.909
physics in this universe, you and I would have

949
00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:38.649
to be having this conversation right now. It could

950
00:46:38.659 --> 00:46:41.110
be like in principle predicted from the 1st, 2nd

951
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.659
after the universe we have. So OK, do you

952
00:46:43.669 --> 00:46:45.669
understand this idea of the universe? All right, people

953
00:46:45.679 --> 00:46:48.030
get this. I got. Yeah. And then we said

954
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:53.360
no, um here's a question and then were split

955
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.570
into two conditions in one condition. They got an

956
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.939
abstract question. The abstract question was, can anyone in

957
00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.959
this universe ever be morally responsible for anything they

958
00:47:01.969 --> 00:47:05.449
ever do? And an overwhelmingly participant saying no in

959
00:47:05.469 --> 00:47:09.350
this universe that you described universe, a no one

960
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.729
can ever be more responsible for anything. It's just

961
00:47:11.739 --> 00:47:15.840
not possible. Determinist the universe. That's what philosophers call

962
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:20.050
incompatible with. It's called incompatible because it's saying moral

963
00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.229
responsibility is incompatible with determinism. Then in the other

964
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.080
people got a very different question. It was a

965
00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.260
concrete question. So participants, which will imagine one guy

966
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:32.239
in that universe, a guy in universe a he

967
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.290
falls in love with his secretary and he wants

968
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.850
to like leave his wife and family for a

969
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.649
secretary. So he sets up an inn device in

970
00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:41.610
his basement that burns down the house and kills

971
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.639
his own wife and Children. Is that guy more

972
00:47:44.649 --> 00:47:47.060
than responsible that guy in universe A is he

973
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.030
morally responsible for what he did? And their participants

974
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.870
overwhelmingly say yes. So these are obviously like logically

975
00:47:54.879 --> 00:47:58.320
inconsistent participants are saying in universe A in the

976
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.429
abstract, no one can ever be more responsible for

977
00:48:00.439 --> 00:48:02.260
anything they do. But they're also saying that one

978
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.439
guy who was in universe A is totally more

979
00:48:04.449 --> 00:48:06.280
responsible for this one thing that he did.

980
00:48:08.879 --> 00:48:11.939
So, a and since we've been talking about moral

981
00:48:11.949 --> 00:48:16.469
judgments and how they affect or influence, uh thinking

982
00:48:16.479 --> 00:48:20.919
about different topics, uh The uh what uh is

983
00:48:20.929 --> 00:48:23.659
it the case that what you just mentioned there

984
00:48:23.669 --> 00:48:29.659
points to uh moral judgment also influencing how we

985
00:48:29.669 --> 00:48:32.489
think about free will. I mean, in that particular

986
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.780
case, uh is, should we conclude that if people

987
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:42.879
want to blame someone, they tend to attribute free

988
00:48:42.889 --> 00:48:44.659
will to their actions?

989
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.179
Yeah. At first I thought that was right. The

990
00:48:47.189 --> 00:48:50.300
thing that you just said and then in, in

991
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.560
a really beautiful series of studies, Florent Cage showed

992
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:57.179
that it, it's not right. So there really is

993
00:48:57.189 --> 00:49:01.820
a difference between concrete things and abstract things. So

994
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.550
when it's concrete, people think it's due to um

995
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:11.540
to your um uh when it's concrete, they think

996
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.409
that you, you're, you're responsible for it and you

997
00:49:13.419 --> 00:49:14.840
do it freely and when it's abstract, I think

998
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.040
you don't, but it's not due to, for example,

999
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.800
you being really upset about the thing the person

1000
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:23.199
did and really wanting to blame them. So for

1001
00:49:23.209 --> 00:49:26.570
example, if you start dialing down how bad it

1002
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.080
is to something that's just kind of like feels

1003
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.320
bad in the kind of a technical sense, but

1004
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.399
isn't really like something that people would be outraged

1005
00:49:33.409 --> 00:49:36.389
by like in my example, people still think the

1006
00:49:36.399 --> 00:49:39.300
person is more the responsible and then coal looked

1007
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.310
at people who have frontal temporal dementia. And so

1008
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.070
as a result of this um disorder, they don't

1009
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.169
feel angry at people in the same way they

1010
00:49:48.179 --> 00:49:50.840
normally would in cases like this and those people

1011
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.149
have been shown to have very different judgments about

1012
00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:55.389
certain kinds of matters. But unless they show the

1013
00:49:55.399 --> 00:49:58.830
exact same pattern of judgments. So if things like

1014
00:49:59.649 --> 00:50:04.439
it's really something about the concreteness, it's about thinking

1015
00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:07.219
about an individual, human being doing an individual thing

1016
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:10.870
and it's not something about um the rage that

1017
00:50:10.879 --> 00:50:12.610
you feel against this person who killed his own

1018
00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:13.149
Children

1019
00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:19.719
but OK, whatever it is behind it, uh we

1020
00:50:19.729 --> 00:50:23.570
see these occurring cross culturally. I mean, do people

1021
00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.530
tend to, when they are presented with abstract or

1022
00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.610
concrete scenarios, do they tend to think about them

1023
00:50:31.899 --> 00:50:34.830
in similar ways? Cross culturally.

1024
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.830
We, we do. Yeah, it looks like we do.

1025
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.879
So we do find in one study that participants

1026
00:50:43.889 --> 00:50:47.149
in the abstract think about these things in, in

1027
00:50:47.159 --> 00:50:51.100
a similar way cross culturally. And then we also

1028
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:55.669
find in the um this isn't, so that was

1029
00:50:55.679 --> 00:50:59.330
in the um uh Sarkissian Nicholson, I did. And

1030
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.370
then in the study that I just mentioned from

1031
00:51:01.379 --> 00:51:04.780
Heine Kanen, participants are given like a little concrete

1032
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.120
vignette that's designed in such a way that, that

1033
00:51:07.129 --> 00:51:09.820
it's confusing, you know, different people say different things

1034
00:51:10.375 --> 00:51:12.554
in the United States. People are very divided, you

1035
00:51:12.564 --> 00:51:14.334
know, half the people say one thing and half

1036
00:51:14.344 --> 00:51:16.024
the people say another thing. And then if you

1037
00:51:16.034 --> 00:51:18.054
look at China, people are also very divided. If

1038
00:51:18.064 --> 00:51:20.114
you look at different countries in Africa, people are

1039
00:51:20.125 --> 00:51:23.215
also very divided there. It feels like that division

1040
00:51:23.225 --> 00:51:25.905
is itself something that's called that we're seeing across

1041
00:51:25.915 --> 00:51:30.219
many different cultures. I find they're quite striking like

1042
00:51:30.229 --> 00:51:34.360
that. If you think about what you might expect

1043
00:51:34.639 --> 00:51:37.219
to be the same across cultures, you might think

1044
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.870
there are these things that are really fundamental to

1045
00:51:40.879 --> 00:51:43.250
just being able to survive in our world. Like

1046
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.949
things like, for example, judgments about how it's appropriate

1047
00:51:46.959 --> 00:51:49.659
to treat your own Children or something like that,

1048
00:51:49.669 --> 00:51:52.060
that you could imagine in no culture would people

1049
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.040
think it's OK to do certain terrible things to

1050
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.120
their Children? And that would be a universal thought.

1051
00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:00.439
What we're seeing here is these very obscure seeming

1052
00:52:00.449 --> 00:52:05.530
like metaphysical questions about free will. Judgments on these

1053
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.040
questions seem to be universal. And that, that seems

1054
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.449
like a really puzzling phenomenon that it's the kind

1055
00:52:11.459 --> 00:52:14.040
of thing you might have thought would vary considerably

1056
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.790
and that there would be no reason to expect

1057
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.090
that you kind of be built to the nature

1058
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.139
of our cognition to give similar judgments on questions

1059
00:52:21.149 --> 00:52:21.939
like those.

1060
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.590
So uh and I mean, when it comes to

1061
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.750
finding these universals, these human universals, when it comes

1062
00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.830
to philosophical intuitions and we're going to get into

1063
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.340
some more of them, we talked about free will

1064
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:43.580
here. Uh Do you also, are you also interested

1065
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:49.030
in trying to understand where do those universals come

1066
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.750
from? If for example, they are the result of

1067
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:58.429
evolution by natural selection operating on a cognitive level

1068
00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:01.350
or some other thing?

1069
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.620
Yeah. A absolutely. So we, we would absolutely want

1070
00:53:05.629 --> 00:53:07.719
to know why these things seem to arise across

1071
00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:10.530
cultures. So maybe it's too much to say these

1072
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.770
things are universal. It's not that we would really

1073
00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.260
have evidence for that, you know, from any study.

1074
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.449
But I think that they're surprisingly stable and you

1075
00:53:19.459 --> 00:53:23.209
know, a really difficult question arises as to why

1076
00:53:23.219 --> 00:53:25.969
they would be so stable. So maybe it would

1077
00:53:25.979 --> 00:53:28.010
be helpful to give an example of the kind

1078
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.600
of thing that just feels like super weird and

1079
00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.929
kind of like just a very strange quirk, but

1080
00:53:32.939 --> 00:53:36.689
turns out to be surprisingly stable across cultures. So

1081
00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:39.159
this is an effect that was first discovered by

1082
00:53:39.169 --> 00:53:42.090
um Wesley Buck Walter and James Beanie. And then

1083
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.610
these cross cultural studies were done by um mj

1084
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.719
Kim and Yuan, y So what we Lee Buchalter

1085
00:53:49.729 --> 00:53:52.129
and James BB were just interested in when people

1086
00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:54.280
think, you know, something versus just really something, it

1087
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:55.570
turns out to be true, like in the case

1088
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.260
that I just described before, you know, so they

1089
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.010
had the idea that maybe mortality affects it. So

1090
00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:02.850
here's the kind of study that they ran in

1091
00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.419
one condition, someone's the mayor of a town and

1092
00:54:06.489 --> 00:54:09.639
um he gets some uh has a meeting with

1093
00:54:09.649 --> 00:54:12.360
someone who's like, you know, one of his employees

1094
00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:14.370
and the employee says, ok, we've got this new

1095
00:54:14.379 --> 00:54:18.020
policy that we're considering and this new policy is

1096
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.659
going to really increase campaign contributions to you. So

1097
00:54:20.669 --> 00:54:24.020
you're gonna make tons of money and it's also

1098
00:54:24.129 --> 00:54:26.459
going to bring jobs to people from the town.

1099
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.550
And then he says, I don't really care about

1100
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.320
bringing jobs to people in this town. All I

1101
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:31.629
want to do is just get as much money

1102
00:54:31.639 --> 00:54:34.780
as possible for myself. So he says, to um

1103
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.110
sign this contract that's going to adopt the policy.

1104
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.620
So he goes in to sign the contract and

1105
00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:41.439
then as he's just about to sign it, the

1106
00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:44.139
corporation switches it for a completely different contract. So

1107
00:54:44.149 --> 00:54:45.939
the contract he signed is not at all the

1108
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.919
one that he thought he was gonna sign. But

1109
00:54:47.929 --> 00:54:50.169
then it turned out that that other contract, the

1110
00:54:50.179 --> 00:54:52.760
one he really did sign, ends up bringing jobs

1111
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:54.840
to people in this town. So he believed he

1112
00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.739
would bring jobs to people in town and he

1113
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.010
did bring jobs to the people in town. Did

1114
00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.550
he know that he was gonna bring jobs to

1115
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.870
the people in town. In that case, most people

1116
00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:07.070
say no, ok. Now consider another case. The assistant

1117
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.139
comes to the mayor and says, we've got this

1118
00:55:09.149 --> 00:55:11.290
new policy. It's gonna make huge amounts of money

1119
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.649
for you. So you'll get all these campaign contributions,

1120
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.469
but it's also gonna cut jobs for people in

1121
00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:17.270
the town. So people in the town are gonna

1122
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.629
really be hurt by this policy. And the they

1123
00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:21.020
says, I don't care about the people in the

1124
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.239
town. I know they're gonna cut, you know, it's

1125
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:24.790
gonna cut their jobs, but I don't care about

1126
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.040
that. Let's just go ahead and, and do this.

1127
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.469
So he goes to sign the contract and then

1128
00:55:29.479 --> 00:55:31.159
the corporation, he's gonna sign the contract to it

1129
00:55:31.169 --> 00:55:34.040
switches out for a different contract. So the one

1130
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.600
he's signing has all different provisions says all different

1131
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.479
stuff. But that other country does end up cutting

1132
00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:42.560
jobs to the town. Did he know that he

1133
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:43.919
was going to cut jobs to people in the

1134
00:55:43.929 --> 00:55:48.090
town? In that case, people say yes, that just

1135
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.719
feels like a really weird, like quirky thing about

1136
00:55:50.729 --> 00:55:54.479
our way of understanding knowledge. And then um Kim

1137
00:55:54.489 --> 00:55:57.979
and um Yuan studied that same thing by translating

1138
00:55:57.989 --> 00:55:59.550
all of these vignettes. I just gave you into

1139
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.929
Korean and Chinese and then running them on Korean

1140
00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:05.300
and Chinese people. And the same thing happens among

1141
00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:10.040
participants in South Korea and China. So why would

1142
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.040
that be? It? It feels like this weird thing

1143
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:16.040
I just told you, it doesn't feel like we

1144
00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.419
would have evolved to have that exact quality, this

1145
00:56:19.429 --> 00:56:23.770
quality of making knowledge judgments based on morality. It,

1146
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.899
I don't know if it, if it's somehow in

1147
00:56:26.909 --> 00:56:30.120
some way built into us innately, it must be

1148
00:56:30.129 --> 00:56:33.030
that somehow just the side effect or byproduct's of

1149
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.449
other cognitive capacities we have that serve some other

1150
00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:38.449
use. It's very hard to see what might be

1151
00:56:38.459 --> 00:56:40.370
going on here. I feel like it's very puzzling

1152
00:56:40.459 --> 00:56:42.919
why these things we're seeing are happening across different

1153
00:56:42.929 --> 00:56:43.600
cultures.

1154
00:56:44.689 --> 00:56:48.300
OK. So they could still be the result or

1155
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:53.709
a by-product of certain uh cognitive adaptations, but they

1156
00:56:53.719 --> 00:57:00.000
are not necessarily adaptations themselves or are not necessarily

1157
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:01.659
evolved themselves.

1158
00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:03.810
It feels very unlikely in the case that I

1159
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:08.419
just told you that human beings there was selective

1160
00:57:08.429 --> 00:57:12.090
pressure for making knowledge judgments in a way that's

1161
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:15.590
infused by morality. I mean, that one thing doesn't

1162
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.379
seem like it was really being selected for. It

1163
00:57:18.389 --> 00:57:22.149
could be that our judgments about that one thing

1164
00:57:22.429 --> 00:57:24.879
are the product of these cognitive processes and those

1165
00:57:24.889 --> 00:57:28.260
processes were selected for in some way. But those

1166
00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.510
processes also do other things that seems like it

1167
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.679
could make sense. It could be that there's convergent

1168
00:57:35.689 --> 00:57:38.959
cultural evolution. It's a very complex problem to understand

1169
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.959
why these things are so stable across cultures.

1170
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.469
Mhm But uh I asked you as an example

1171
00:57:46.479 --> 00:57:50.620
about uh free will but have you or some

1172
00:57:50.629 --> 00:57:55.699
of your other colleagues in experimental philosophy uh studied

1173
00:57:55.889 --> 00:58:01.070
uh people's philosophical intuitions in general? I mean, and

1174
00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.600
if so do they tend to vary a lot

1175
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:09.820
or are they stable across, for example, demographic groups

1176
00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:11.629
and situations?

1177
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.810
Well, that's a wonderful question. So first of all,

1178
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.199
obviously, the answer is that in some ways they're

1179
00:58:18.209 --> 00:58:19.610
stable and in some ways they're different. I mean,

1180
00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.330
we could have known that before we ran any

1181
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:25.290
studies there. It's not that there's no differences ever

1182
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:28.709
between cultures on anything and there's no differences I

1183
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:31.540
don't know between genders on anything. And it's also

1184
00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:34.500
not that every single thing is totally different between

1185
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.310
cultures and between genders and then different people have

1186
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.419
different opinions about how to understand what, what we

1187
00:58:40.429 --> 00:58:44.209
actually discovered. I mean, given that we found that

1188
00:58:44.219 --> 00:58:46.340
some things differ and some things stay the same.

1189
00:58:46.479 --> 00:58:49.209
You know, what should we be struck by my

1190
00:58:49.219 --> 00:58:50.870
own opinion? And this is certainly a matter of

1191
00:58:50.939 --> 00:58:53.280
debate. Is that what we should really be struck

1192
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.649
by is just how similar everything is that it's

1193
00:58:56.659 --> 00:59:00.449
not that everything stayed the same, it's not that

1194
00:59:00.459 --> 00:59:03.820
everything was different, but overall things were just amazingly

1195
00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:08.260
amazingly similar. So just to give an example, there

1196
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.739
was a really nice paper by Edelberg Thompson and

1197
00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:13.199
Nus that looked at a whole bunch of different

1198
00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:16.939
things that people thought might differ across genders. So

1199
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:21.580
these were all um uh effects that someone had

1200
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.100
actually said in existing literature. I said this is

1201
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:27.330
going to differ between men and women. And then

1202
00:59:27.629 --> 00:59:29.229
for all of them, I think it was maybe

1203
00:59:29.929 --> 00:59:32.649
21 different things or 18 different things. Some of

1204
00:59:32.659 --> 00:59:34.510
them like that, that they checked whether there was

1205
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.959
a difference and it's not that they found no

1206
00:59:37.969 --> 00:59:42.540
differences, it's that they found one difference. So approximately

1207
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:46.020
what they found is one intuitions on one thing

1208
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:48.510
did differ between men and women and on the

1209
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.860
other, you know, around 19, all of those were

1210
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:54.649
the same. So that doesn't mean there are no

1211
00:59:54.659 --> 00:59:58.110
differences, there are differences. But overall, the message seems

1212
00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:02.000
to be, these things are really, really similar. And

1213
01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:05.310
then I feel like what, what we're seeing especially

1214
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:10.850
is um if you consider certain kinds of um

1215
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.040
moral judgments, for example, or judgments about religious things

1216
01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:18.149
are, are explicitly transmitted to people. Like people, like

1217
01:00:18.159 --> 01:00:22.389
your parents tell you about morality. Yeah. Then obviously

1218
01:00:22.399 --> 01:00:25.649
we get cross cultural differences on those things. So.

1219
01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.870
Mhm. So, if you grew up in Iowa or

1220
01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:30.479
you grew up in Brazil, you're gonna have different

1221
01:00:30.489 --> 01:00:33.689
judgments about morality and it's really obvious why it's

1222
01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:35.929
like, people are just explicitly telling you about morality.

1223
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.879
But most things that philosophers study are things that

1224
01:00:39.889 --> 01:00:41.780
no one ever tells you about. Like when you're

1225
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.489
growing up, no one ever says, you know, I

1226
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.739
just really want you to understand that whether someone

1227
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.669
has knowledge depends in part on whether something is

1228
01:00:50.679 --> 01:00:52.889
morally good or morally bad. Like then you just

1229
01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.419
kind of pick stuff up but no one ever

1230
01:00:54.429 --> 01:00:57.020
talks about it and on those things, the things

1231
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.570
that no one ever talks about, we really seem

1232
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.189
to be getting amazing degrees of sonari.

1233
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.520
Yeah, that, that's very interesting. And I, and I

1234
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:11.510
mean, another interesting question, I guess about all of

1235
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.080
these that we've been talk about we've been talking

1236
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:19.790
about is so this is about folk philosophy. But

1237
01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:24.550
I mean, philosophers themselves are also people. So I

1238
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.245
mean, when it comes to uh the variation, specifically,

1239
01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:33.455
the variation we find across different groups of people,

1240
01:01:33.645 --> 01:01:37.885
do you think that by having an understanding of

1241
01:01:38.215 --> 01:01:42.794
what's behind that variation, we could also have a

1242
01:01:42.804 --> 01:01:48.725
better understanding of why professional philosophers differ in their

1243
01:01:48.735 --> 01:01:52.854
views of different philosophical topics? You

1244
01:01:52.864 --> 01:01:55.705
mean why different philosophers have different views, maybe we

1245
01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:59.570
can understand it. Yeah, that's a great question. So,

1246
01:02:00.129 --> 01:02:02.709
um the, the first answer is, I, I don't

1247
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.280
know, I don't know the answer to the question.

1248
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:08.679
And then, um there, there has been some research

1249
01:02:08.689 --> 01:02:11.600
that tries to get out why different philosophers have

1250
01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.500
different views and whether it has to do with

1251
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:19.429
differences between the, the different philosophers and then I'll

1252
01:02:19.439 --> 01:02:21.580
just talk a little bit about what has been

1253
01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:25.439
found. So, in a really nice study by Yaden,

1254
01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:29.020
the result was that one result was that demographic

1255
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:33.000
factors don't predict it. So different philosophers think different

1256
01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.979
stuff. I don't know about free will, about whether

1257
01:02:34.989 --> 01:02:37.550
morality is objective and so forth. And then different

1258
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.239
philosophers are, you know, themselves from, from different cultures.

1259
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.189
And so some are men, some are women, some

1260
01:02:44.199 --> 01:02:48.229
are non-binary like that doesn't predict their judgments. Then

1261
01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:51.270
a separate question was for example, whether facts but

1262
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:55.560
their personalities affect their, their judgments about these things.

1263
01:02:55.739 --> 01:02:59.580
And overall, I would say um in the study

1264
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:05.179
of philosophers, they mostly didn't. So, so facts about

1265
01:03:05.189 --> 01:03:08.159
like what kind of person you are have overall,

1266
01:03:08.169 --> 01:03:11.030
I would say very little impact on, on what

1267
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.610
your philosophical views were but not exclusively. So for

1268
01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:18.719
example, if you ask professional philosophers, whether they do

1269
01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:22.340
drugs, so do you use recreational drugs? And then

1270
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:25.100
you ask them, are there objective truths about art

1271
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.030
like which art is better and which art is

1272
01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.020
worse? Those two things are correlated. So the more

1273
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.830
drugs you use, the less you think there is

1274
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.209
like objective truths about art and that seems to

1275
01:03:34.219 --> 01:03:38.350
be totally real. So there is no, in just

1276
01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.620
in that case, for example, certain kinds of correlations

1277
01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:44.080
between your personality or the kind of life you're

1278
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.010
living in your philosophical. And then in a series

1279
01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.260
of studies that feel really funny to me, Nick

1280
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:55.479
Bird was looking at um the relationship between uh

1281
01:03:55.889 --> 01:03:58.709
like being reflective in the sense that for example,

1282
01:03:58.719 --> 01:04:02.350
you can solve certain logical problems correctly and um

1283
01:04:02.409 --> 01:04:05.419
and having certain answers to philosophical questions, but then

1284
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.939
this might not seem very surprising. But um if

1285
01:04:07.949 --> 01:04:10.090
you ask ordinary folks say, you, you just go

1286
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.209
into like a classroom and you give everyone like

1287
01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:14.860
a bunch of logic puzzles and you can see

1288
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:16.800
who's better, who gets the best right answer and

1289
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:19.909
who gets the wrong answer. Then what you find

1290
01:04:19.919 --> 01:04:23.760
is that um that predicts uh judgments about certain

1291
01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:27.239
philosophical questions. So just as an example, um in

1292
01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.760
the case that I gave you earlier where I

1293
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:32.780
was seeing like um imagine that this person who

1294
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:35.899
kills his wife and family, the, the more you

1295
01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:38.010
um get logic, right, the more you think he's

1296
01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.459
not more responsible for what he did. OK. So

1297
01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:43.070
this is the weird thing that Bird discovered if

1298
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.760
you know, run it on philosophers. So you're running

1299
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:50.310
it on or philosophy professors. It still happens that

1300
01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:53.250
the philosophy professors who get the logic problems, right?

1301
01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:55.850
Tend to have different answers than the philosophy professors

1302
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.850
who don't. So that feels like a very strange

1303
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.750
fact. But he did find it. I, I think

1304
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.500
that the, the, the broader answer to your question

1305
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:12.969
is that I, I think as a philosopher, when

1306
01:05:12.979 --> 01:05:15.320
I consider these questions, like the age old questions

1307
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:17.810
of philosophy that people have been discussing for thousands

1308
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.199
of years, I feel torn, like I feel drawn

1309
01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:23.040
in one direction and drawn in another. And then

1310
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:24.659
eventually I might make up my mind like maybe

1311
01:05:24.669 --> 01:05:27.389
I'm torn. But I decided on this. I think

1312
01:05:27.679 --> 01:05:30.290
one question you could ask is do these theories

1313
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.399
explain why I eventually decided on this? And someone

1314
01:05:32.409 --> 01:05:34.550
else decides on that another question you ask, you

1315
01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.840
could ask is do these theories explain why both

1316
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.959
of us are torn in the first place? I

1317
01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:41.620
think it's definitely the second, but at the very

1318
01:05:41.629 --> 01:05:47.840
least we're really getting some explanation of, of why

1319
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:50.610
people feel confused, if not an explanation of why

1320
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.090
different people resolve the confusion in different ways. Mhm

1321
01:05:54.469 --> 01:05:56.489
But I mean, do you think we should at

1322
01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:03.340
least expect that individual differences in cognition wherever they

1323
01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:10.159
stem from, would have an impact on uh philosopher's

1324
01:06:10.169 --> 01:06:12.679
views or not? Yeah.

1325
01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.399
Well, this in the street that I was just

1326
01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:18.879
talking about, it's sort of a mixed band in

1327
01:06:18.889 --> 01:06:21.679
that. What the study did is it looks at

1328
01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:24.600
a very large number of different philosophical views and

1329
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.810
a very large number of um individual differences in

1330
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:33.030
human cognition and overwhelmingly, the individual difference, variables don't

1331
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.050
predict their philosophical views. So if you could consider

1332
01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.929
all the possible pairs, just overwhelmingly, there's no prediction.

1333
01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.500
And then if you look at most of the

1334
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.870
philosophical views, what you find is that none of

1335
01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:46.360
the individual, different variables predict them. But, but even

1336
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:50.290
though that's true, um we do find that some

1337
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.760
philosophical views are predicted by some individual differences. And

1338
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:57.090
the one example that I just gave was um

1339
01:06:57.449 --> 01:06:59.860
beliefs about what their objective truths about what's artistically

1340
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:03.389
good really are predicted by something. I, I think

1341
01:07:03.399 --> 01:07:10.300
we might find other similar things like it, it

1342
01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:12.909
might be that there are some things going on.

1343
01:07:12.919 --> 01:07:14.870
It doesn't feel like that's gonna be like this

1344
01:07:14.879 --> 01:07:18.330
overwhelming thing that there's like a kind of personality

1345
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.219
that draws you toward something or something else. Maybe

1346
01:07:21.229 --> 01:07:24.110
there's personalities that draw you towards certain methods. I

1347
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.219
don't know what it will turn out to be

1348
01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:25.419
true.

1349
01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.320
Ok. So, uh now to also try to get

1350
01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:34.350
into the production of scientific knowledge and since we've

1351
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.310
been talking about moral judgment a lot, uh do

1352
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.500
we know if uh people's moral judgments also influence

1353
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:47.530
the intuitions they hold uh in folk psychology and

1354
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.989
moral cognition, for example. Oh,

1355
01:07:50.379 --> 01:07:53.800
yeah. Well, a really surprising result that we get

1356
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:58.360
again and again is that um moral intuitions affect

1357
01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:01.610
what's called folk psychology. So, folk psychology is the

1358
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.689
ability to just figure out what's going on in

1359
01:08:03.699 --> 01:08:07.120
other people's minds, like what people are. So, the

1360
01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:10.260
example I gave before was about the true self

1361
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:14.979
that, um, when you're, whether you, what you think

1362
01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:16.839
is morally good or morally bad affects what you

1363
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.330
think is going on deep down in the other

1364
01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:22.319
percent. But maybe the most well known, um, uh,

1365
01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:24.399
result I have along those lines is not, not

1366
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:26.879
about the true self. It's about just whether someone

1367
01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.839
did something intentionally like did they do it on

1368
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:32.189
purpose? So I'll just give you two different cases

1369
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.250
and they're just gonna do for morally. So here's

1370
01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:36.689
the first case. So imagine the vice president of

1371
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.540
a company goes to the CEO. It's OK. We've

1372
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:41.069
got this new policy. It's gonna make huge amounts

1373
01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.430
of money for our company, but it's also gonna

1374
01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:46.560
harm the environment. And the CEO says, look, I

1375
01:08:46.569 --> 01:08:48.259
know it's gonna harm the environment. I don't care

1376
01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:49.839
at all about that. All I care about is

1377
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.000
just making as much money as we possibly can.

1378
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.740
So let's implement the policy. So they implement the

1379
01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.200
policy and then sure enough, it harms the environment

1380
01:08:57.629 --> 01:09:00.919
and the participants are asked, did the CEO do

1381
01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:03.160
it on purpose? Did this CEO do it intentionally?

1382
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.899
And there are people overwhelmingly say yes, the CEO

1383
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:08.450
did it intentionally if you ask them why most

1384
01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:11.770
participants say something like, well, he totally knew that

1385
01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.290
he was gonna harm the environment and then he

1386
01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:16.520
did it anyway. But we thought maybe there's something

1387
01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:18.660
more going on. It's not just about the knowledge.

1388
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:20.740
So suppose you just changed the word harm to

1389
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:22.459
help. So we're gonna leave everything else the same.

1390
01:09:23.129 --> 01:09:24.859
Ok. The vice president goes to the CEO and

1391
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:27.129
says we've got this new policy, it's gonna make

1392
01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.259
huge amounts of money for our company and it's

1393
01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.040
also gonna help the environment. And the CEO says,

1394
01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:34.339
look, you know, it's gonna help the environment, but

1395
01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:36.229
I don't care at all about that. All I

1396
01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.069
care about is just making as much money as

1397
01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.240
we possibly can. So let's implement the policy so

1398
01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:43.200
they implement the policy and then sure enough, it

1399
01:09:43.209 --> 01:09:45.890
helps the environment. Did he help the environment? Intentionally?

1400
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:49.959
Other participants overwhelmingly saying no. So thinking about those

1401
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.709
two cases, it feels like this really weird thing

1402
01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.839
is going on that the only difference between them

1403
01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:56.609
is that one is about doing something bad and

1404
01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.930
one is about doing something good. The question people

1405
01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:01.560
are being asked isn't about like whether they deserve

1406
01:10:01.569 --> 01:10:03.370
blame or praise or anything like that. It's just

1407
01:10:03.379 --> 01:10:06.000
being asked, did they do it on purpose and

1408
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.580
judgments of whether it's bad or good or somehow

1409
01:10:08.589 --> 01:10:10.779
affecting judgments about whether you did it on purpose.

1410
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.560
And so I if moral judgments influence the intuitions

1411
01:10:17.569 --> 01:10:23.479
people hold when it comes to psychology, can that

1412
01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:28.049
also translate into the production of scientific knowledge? I

1413
01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:34.759
mean, can moral judgments also affect the scientists themselves.

1414
01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:38.870
Oh, yeah. So you mean when scientists are trying

1415
01:10:38.879 --> 01:10:41.930
to answer these questions, maybe they themselves are kind

1416
01:10:41.939 --> 01:10:45.959
of being driven. Yeah, that's a really wonderful question.

1417
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:50.029
And, um, what, what we really want to know

1418
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.279
to answer your question is like something like when

1419
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:56.850
you, if you look at the actual evolution of

1420
01:10:56.859 --> 01:11:00.209
research programs are those research programs being driven by,

1421
01:11:00.569 --> 01:11:04.350
by these moral judgments? And it's very hard for

1422
01:11:04.359 --> 01:11:06.520
us to do that to study that question. And

1423
01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:08.069
the reason is it is hard to run an

1424
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.129
experiment. Like you'd want to be like, OK, we

1425
01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.270
randomly sign different scientific research programs to different moral

1426
01:11:13.279 --> 01:11:16.319
statuses. But we can't do anything like that scientific

1427
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:18.709
research programs just happen. However they happen, then we

1428
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.140
can just study them. Mhm The thing that we

1429
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:23.459
did and I'm not sure if this is this

1430
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:25.810
might really not help to in a deeper way,

1431
01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:28.740
answer your question. You should just run experiments where

1432
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:34.040
we ask scientists questions. So we, we um we

1433
01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:36.140
just had scientists and then we're asking them like,

1434
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:38.089
consider this case, can you apply this concept to

1435
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.299
this case? And then we do get effects of

1436
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:42.120
morality. So I'll just give you one of these

1437
01:11:42.129 --> 01:11:44.890
things. So we ask people about the concept of

1438
01:11:44.899 --> 01:11:49.509
being innate. And then, um and then, uh we

1439
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.540
said, um we give them different questions and then

1440
01:11:52.549 --> 01:11:56.439
we asked these scientists like biologists, linguists, psychologists in

1441
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:59.649
these different cases is this thing in it. And

1442
01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.689
then what we do see is the effect of

1443
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.220
morality. So, um, well, here's an example, participants were

1444
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:08.060
told, imagine there's this trait, it's called trait X.

1445
01:12:08.509 --> 01:12:11.189
And now imagine people's genes are such that if

1446
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.680
any, if their parents ever treat them with kindness,

1447
01:12:13.959 --> 01:12:17.629
then um they're gonna develop trade X. But everyone's

1448
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.879
parents treat them with kindness at least sometimes. So

1449
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.930
everyone develops trade X is trade X in it

1450
01:12:23.479 --> 01:12:26.689
and their participants tend to say yes. And now,

1451
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.279
I mean, the person was in the other condition

1452
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.959
were given the sy case, they were told, imagine

1453
01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:33.100
there's trait, it's called trade X. And people's genes

1454
01:12:33.109 --> 01:12:34.649
are such that if their parents are ever mean

1455
01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.819
to them, they'll develop trade act, but everyone's parents

1456
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:39.750
are mean to them at least sometimes. So everyone

1457
01:12:39.759 --> 01:12:42.919
develops trade X is trade act in the and

1458
01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:46.779
their participants seem to say no about participants. I

1459
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.459
don't mean like um just, you know, random people

1460
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.529
on the street. I mean, these are psychologists, linguists,

1461
01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.270
biologists, people who are using this concept. So at

1462
01:12:56.279 --> 01:13:00.330
least in their answers to these questions, these scientists

1463
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:02.879
judgments are being affected by immorality.

1464
01:13:04.799 --> 01:13:07.990
So I, I mean, at uh can we at

1465
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.240
least say that um scientists are not immune to

1466
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:20.740
their own moral judgments when they are producing knowledge?

1467
01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.500
Right. Yeah. Well, we can definitely say that there's

1468
01:13:23.509 --> 01:13:27.120
not something within the minds of the individual scientists

1469
01:13:27.129 --> 01:13:30.259
that makes this not have an effect. And then

1470
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.140
the key question that we would face if we

1471
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:36.370
really wanted to answer your question. And I'm not

1472
01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:38.850
sure if our data speak to your larger question

1473
01:13:38.859 --> 01:13:40.890
is not a question about what's going on in

1474
01:13:40.899 --> 01:13:43.620
the mind of each individual scientist, but a question

1475
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:47.680
about the larger kind of social structures that allow

1476
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:51.680
scientific research to progress. So it's not like um

1477
01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:54.049
when you're trained as a scientist, you develop some

1478
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.939
special thing in your brain that allows you to

1479
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:59.100
not have morality influence it, that is not happening.

1480
01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:02.939
So if there was some way that morality would

1481
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:06.069
not influence things or not influence it in quite

1482
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.910
the same way or, or have a decreased influence

1483
01:14:09.919 --> 01:14:12.580
or anything like that, it, it wouldn't be something

1484
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:15.359
in the mind of the individual scientists. It would

1485
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:18.229
have to be something in the whole way that

1486
01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.950
science is structured. Like for example, the fact that

1487
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.930
that um you're not just seeing stuff, you're trying

1488
01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:28.549
to get it um published in a journal and

1489
01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.620
the peer reviewers on that journal might have different

1490
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:34.720
moral judgments than you. And so you're the way

1491
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:36.830
that you're gonna paper is gonna eventually turn out

1492
01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.330
is not going to be just a pure reflection

1493
01:14:38.339 --> 01:14:41.330
of your own moral judgments, but also of this

1494
01:14:41.339 --> 01:14:45.680
larger um interpersonal structure that involves people with very

1495
01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:49.069
different moral judgments, all kind of working together to

1496
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.310
eventually create a series of publications that actually get

1497
01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:53.250
published in journals.

1498
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.629
Mhm. No, I also asked you about that because

1499
01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.870
people today are discussing a lot, the potential effects

1500
01:15:02.879 --> 01:15:07.629
that, uh, moral values and political values more specifically

1501
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.310
of, of course, the relationship between morality and politics

1502
01:15:12.319 --> 01:15:17.825
is not, uh, completely well under, I mean, I've

1503
01:15:17.834 --> 01:15:21.055
talked with political scientists and political psychologists on the

1504
01:15:21.064 --> 01:15:25.774
show and it's complicated to really understand what's the

1505
01:15:25.785 --> 01:15:30.604
real relationship between morality and politics or moral values

1506
01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:33.654
and political values. But anyway, people uh now uh

1507
01:15:33.665 --> 01:15:40.439
nowadays are discussing a lot uh the potential negative

1508
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:47.129
impacts of uh certain political ideologies within academia and

1509
01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.520
so on. And I mean, I was trying to

1510
01:15:49.529 --> 01:15:53.859
understand if some of your work when it comes

1511
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:57.990
in this case, not necessarily having to do with

1512
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.939
politics, but more with moral judgment if it would

1513
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:06.709
tell us something or have something to perhaps add

1514
01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.740
to depth discussion and to what extent we should

1515
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:16.580
or shouldn't be worried about uh people's beliefs

1516
01:16:16.589 --> 01:16:20.930
basically. Yeah, our, our work con the work some

1517
01:16:20.939 --> 01:16:22.689
of the work that we've done recently contributes to

1518
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.959
that question in a very small way. So if

1519
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:27.959
you will be disappointed with a very small contribution,

1520
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:29.569
we may maybe it will be helpful, maybe be

1521
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:34.359
interesting. So um one question that people have often

1522
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.589
um been troubled by is the question about the

1523
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:43.490
influence of essentialism on prejudice. So the thought is

1524
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.299
um uh people have certain kind of scientific beliefs

1525
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:50.220
um by, by scientifically I don't mean, um, beliefs

1526
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:52.569
of people who are scientists. I meant, like, if

1527
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.819
you're just an ordinary person you have scientific beliefs

1528
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:55.930
because I don't know, you go to high school,

1529
01:16:55.939 --> 01:16:57.919
you just start to develop, like, beliefs about scientific

1530
01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:01.000
questions. Mhm. One kind of belief that you could

1531
01:17:01.009 --> 01:17:03.569
have is what people sometimes call an essentialist belief.

1532
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.000
So you could think. Um, I don't know. For

1533
01:17:06.009 --> 01:17:10.060
example, I, I'm Jewish and some people think, um,

1534
01:17:10.069 --> 01:17:14.220
there's some sort of like, um, Jewish essence that's

1535
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:16.919
sort of like biological, that all Jewish people have

1536
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:20.049
and differentiates them from not Jewish people. And then

1537
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:24.089
it's been a real concern in our field that,

1538
01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.500
um, those beliefs, essentialist beliefs might give rise to

1539
01:17:28.509 --> 01:17:32.169
prejudice. The, the more you centralize a certain group,

1540
01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.589
like, for example, the more you think there's like

1541
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.359
a Jewish essence, the more you'll be prejudiced against

1542
01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.459
that group, for example, the more you'll be anti-semitic.

1543
01:17:39.089 --> 01:17:41.419
So, thought that was right. Then you might think

1544
01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:43.770
instead of just seeing whatever we think is true

1545
01:17:43.779 --> 01:17:46.979
about these kind of questions regarding genetic basis of

1546
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:48.979
racial groups or something like that. We have a

1547
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:52.770
real reason, a, a moral reason to not say

1548
01:17:52.779 --> 01:17:55.540
certain things because seeing those things might increase prejudice,

1549
01:17:55.549 --> 01:17:57.759
increase discrimination, which I find it to be a

1550
01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:02.640
very plausible view. So, um, April Ba and I,

1551
01:18:03.069 --> 01:18:06.290
we thought that view was right. And so we,

1552
01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:09.100
um, we wanted to, uh, sort of build on

1553
01:18:09.109 --> 01:18:11.209
it and extend it in certain ways. And so

1554
01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.069
we ran a whole series of studies in which

1555
01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.830
we have manipulated the degree to which people thought

1556
01:18:16.839 --> 01:18:18.779
there was kind of a genetic essence of a

1557
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.379
particular social group. And then we checked to see

1558
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:24.680
whether there was a downstream effect on, on prejudice

1559
01:18:24.689 --> 01:18:27.399
or stereotyping. And in all of the studies, again

1560
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:29.279
and again, we found the same result. So here's

1561
01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:31.839
what the result is. First of all, there is

1562
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:34.399
a correlation between those two things. So the more

1563
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.799
people centralize, the more they think, the more they

1564
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.649
are prejudiced against those other groups. So in my

1565
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.649
example, Judaism idea would be um if you looked

1566
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.899
across a whole bunch of different people and you

1567
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:48.560
measured whether they think there's like a genetic basis

1568
01:18:48.569 --> 01:18:51.810
of being Jewish, though the person, people who more

1569
01:18:51.819 --> 01:18:54.410
think there is are gonna be more anti Semitic

1570
01:18:54.419 --> 01:18:56.439
than the people who less think there is. The

1571
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:59.490
second thing we found is that if you change

1572
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.500
people's essentialism, like for example, we make people more

1573
01:19:02.509 --> 01:19:05.049
essentialist or make them less essentialist that has no

1574
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.220
effect at all on how prejudiced they are. So

1575
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.939
what those two things together seem to suggest is

1576
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:14.160
that the causal arrow is going the other way.

1577
01:19:15.589 --> 01:19:19.049
So if you think about, I don't know, Hitler

1578
01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.569
was very anti Semitic and also thought there was

1579
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.600
like this essential, essential aspect of Judi. So what

1580
01:19:25.649 --> 01:19:27.379
I say you could think is just for whatever

1581
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:30.279
reason she just happened to think there's like this,

1582
01:19:30.509 --> 01:19:35.250
um, heritable genetic thing and then that caused him

1583
01:19:35.259 --> 01:19:38.129
to be anti Semitic. But maybe it's the other

1584
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.240
way, it's that for whatever reason, he hated this

1585
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:43.890
group of people and then he hitting this group

1586
01:19:43.899 --> 01:19:48.160
of people led him to think this weird stuff.

1587
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:52.580
Like, so then if we could somehow make him

1588
01:19:52.589 --> 01:19:55.160
stop believing all of that weird stuff, like about

1589
01:19:55.379 --> 01:19:58.660
heritability or something, it, it wouldn't make him be

1590
01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.290
less an anti Semitic. It's only, it's the other

1591
01:20:01.299 --> 01:20:03.279
way. If we could make him less anti-semitic, then

1592
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:04.810
it would make him less involved in this weird

1593
01:20:04.819 --> 01:20:11.020
stuff. So this one thing seemed to suggest it's

1594
01:20:11.029 --> 01:20:14.569
really going the other way. It's not that people's

1595
01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.560
scientific beliefs are having these downstream impacts on their

1596
01:20:17.569 --> 01:20:19.959
moral judgments. It's that people's moral judgments are having

1597
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:21.890
these downstream impacts on their scientific beliefs.

1598
01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:28.560
That, that's, that's really fascinating. So, uh I mean,

1599
01:20:29.299 --> 01:20:32.160
uh yeah, because we tend to have this idea

1600
01:20:32.169 --> 01:20:37.560
that if people are essentialist, then that cause that

1601
01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:43.549
causes their uh beliefs, their discriminatory or hateful be

1602
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:47.330
beliefs. But then what you're saying there is that

1603
01:20:47.339 --> 01:20:51.259
it could be the other way around that people

1604
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:56.049
already have those beliefs and then uh that would

1605
01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:01.649
cause them to be essentially sort, we centralize certain

1606
01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.890
groups of people.

1607
01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.810
Yeah, that's the result we're getting, we very much

1608
01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:07.859
expected it to be the other way, the way

1609
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:11.020
that you said. But I don't confirm what we

1610
01:21:11.029 --> 01:21:13.720
thought, like, it really feels like. Yeah, if, if

1611
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:16.009
we took some very racist people and all we

1612
01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.939
did was say, um, you know, here's some interesting

1613
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:21.589
results about genetics or something like that and then

1614
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.350
suppose that they were very convinced they were like,

1615
01:21:23.359 --> 01:21:25.310
oh, yeah, I really appreciate all this genetic information.

1616
01:21:25.319 --> 01:21:28.259
Sound. That sounds totally right. That wouldn't make them

1617
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:30.939
less racist. It's just, it's, it's like, that's not

1618
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:33.819
the thing that would actually change the, the degree

1619
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:35.169
to which they're doing racist things.

1620
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:39.459
Yeah, that's very interesting. So, uh I have a

1621
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:44.419
couple of more questions uh now regarding how people

1622
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:49.850
understand truth itself, so does the way people interact

1623
01:21:49.859 --> 01:21:54.459
socially? I mean, if they are cooperating or competing,

1624
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:59.319
more influence how they comes through truth in terms

1625
01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:02.370
of subjectivity or objectivity.

1626
01:22:02.979 --> 01:22:04.609
Yeah, this really relates to the topic we were

1627
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.390
talking about a really long time ago, we were

1628
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:08.779
talking about whether people think there even is an

1629
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.259
objective, the right answer to a question. So in

1630
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:14.609
these studies with Matthew Fisher, we had participants randomly

1631
01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.439
assigned to two groups. So in one group, they

1632
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:19.990
were told, OK, you're gonna talk with someone who

1633
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.310
has the opposite opinion of you on some, on

1634
01:22:22.319 --> 01:22:25.649
this topic. So um for example, if you're pro

1635
01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.899
choice, this other person will be pro-life or if

1636
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.839
you're in favor of the death penalty, this other

1637
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:32.060
person will be opposed to the death penalty. And

1638
01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:35.299
then, and they really are talking, they really are

1639
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:37.970
engaged in this discussion with this other person. They're

1640
01:22:37.979 --> 01:22:39.549
doing it on the internet, like through this kind

1641
01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.569
of chat service. And then in one group we

1642
01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.459
said, um, so what you have to do is

1643
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:47.129
like, win the argument. Like, um this other person

1644
01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.620
is gonna argue, say for the pro life position,

1645
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:52.419
you have to like beat them and, and win

1646
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:55.220
for the um pro choice position. But in the

1647
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:58.649
other condition, he said, um this other person has

1648
01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.049
the opposite view of you. And we want you

1649
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.669
to like, try to understand this other person and

1650
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.930
for you and this other person to kind of

1651
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:08.529
corporate to each understand where the other one is

1652
01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.149
coming from. Like why do they think the things

1653
01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.009
they do? Like what's their perspective and so forth?

1654
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:16.660
So then participants um are just like having a

1655
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:18.910
conversation where they're like writing back and forth to

1656
01:23:18.919 --> 01:23:20.819
each other in this way, either to defeat the

1657
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:24.379
other or to um understand the other. And then

1658
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:27.419
after silver, then we ask the kind of question

1659
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:29.759
we talked about earlier, is there really a truth

1660
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:33.560
about this question? So say about the abortion question,

1661
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.520
is there really a right answer between pro life

1662
01:23:37.529 --> 01:23:39.970
and portraits? And what we find is that the

1663
01:23:39.979 --> 01:23:41.819
more you're in a competitive interaction where you're trying

1664
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:44.410
to like defeat the other person, the more you

1665
01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:46.919
think there is an objective answer. And when you're

1666
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:48.910
in a co-operative interaction. We're trying to understand the

1667
01:23:48.919 --> 01:23:50.819
other person, the more you think there isn't even

1668
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:51.470
a correct.

1669
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.589
And so with that in mind, uh my last

1670
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.830
question will be then can politics and specifically political

1671
01:24:02.839 --> 01:24:07.160
polarization change our understanding of truth?

1672
01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.209
That's a great question. I, I don't know the

1673
01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.459
answer to your question, but I'm even though I

1674
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:14.029
don't know, I'm just gonna make a, make a

1675
01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.589
guess. So, um right now, what we find is

1676
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.490
that um uh well, there's a correlation that the,

1677
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.799
the more people are divided about some question, the

1678
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:28.290
more people think there's no objectively right answer to

1679
01:24:28.299 --> 01:24:31.390
it. So, um if you ask, is there a

1680
01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.529
right answer about whether murder is morally wrong? People

1681
01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.240
think there is, if you ask is the right

1682
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:37.649
answer about whether abortion is morally wrong. People tend

1683
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.580
to think that there's not. And then, although we

1684
01:24:41.589 --> 01:24:43.859
don't have any data to suggest this, my guess

1685
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:48.339
is that that effect arises because people are able

1686
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:50.060
to think about people on the opposite side of

1687
01:24:50.069 --> 01:24:51.870
this issue in a certain way, they're able to

1688
01:24:51.879 --> 01:24:54.319
like kind of take the perspective of the that

1689
01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:56.520
person and care about that person and so forth.

1690
01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.060
But if polarization continues to grow, so that we're

1691
01:25:00.069 --> 01:25:03.470
really forming almost like two nations where people never

1692
01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:05.240
interact with each other and never talk with each

1693
01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.729
other. They don't even care whether the other person

1694
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.040
likes them and they're just each talking with people

1695
01:25:09.049 --> 01:25:10.779
on their own side of the aisle and not

1696
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:13.560
connecting with people. Not yet. My guess would be

1697
01:25:13.569 --> 01:25:16.419
that it will gradually change. And this tendency that

1698
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:19.529
we see right now, if people say maybe that

1699
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.589
person isn't actually wrong, maybe there's no truth of

1700
01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.209
the matter that will decrease and then people will

1701
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.720
start to see there's only one truth and it's

1702
01:25:26.729 --> 01:25:28.569
our truth. We're the ones who are right and

1703
01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:29.339
most people are.

1704
01:25:31.439 --> 01:25:35.140
Ok, great. So, uh Josh, just before we go,

1705
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:37.580
would you like to tell people where they can

1706
01:25:37.589 --> 01:25:39.939
find you and your work on the internet?

1707
01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:43.870
Oh, I don't know. I mean, uh wait, that's

1708
01:25:43.879 --> 01:25:47.560
a great question. You, I guess maybe you, I

1709
01:25:47.569 --> 01:25:49.160
mean, you could just go to my website but

1710
01:25:49.169 --> 01:25:51.779
that might not be much fun. Maybe a fun

1711
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:53.339
thing to do would be if you look up

1712
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:57.390
experimental philosophy on, on youtube, you can find uh

1713
01:25:57.399 --> 01:26:02.060
videos of that are explaining different experimental philosophy studies

1714
01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:03.640
and that's sort of where people are acting out

1715
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:05.580
these little stories that I just told you and

1716
01:26:05.589 --> 01:26:06.879
that might be much more enjoyable.

1717
01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.350
OK, great. So, thank you so much for taking

1718
