00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:06.019
Center. I'm your host, Ricard Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.609
joined by Doctors Andrew Dalton and Talbot Andrews. Doctor

4
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.239
Andrew Dalton is a returned guest. He is associate

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.790
professor in the Department of Political Science, the Center

6
00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:20.620
for Behavioral Political Economy and the College of Business

7
00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:24.950
at Stony Brook University. And Dr Talbot Andrews is

8
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.790
assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of

9
00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:32.240
Connecticut. And they are both authors of climate games

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.209
experiments on how people prevent disaster and uh say

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.990
something, Doctor Dalton for people to, to see

12
00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.080
this book. Uh The book just came out. Um

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.880
It's available on Amazon in both paperback and hardback

14
00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:50.310
and you can also get it directly through University

15
00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.970
of Michigan Press's website. And if you go to

16
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.040
their website, uh the book is actually available completely

17
00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.520
free as a download too. So if you just

18
00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:00.740
want an electronic copy of the entire thing, it's

19
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139
a one stop shop, just download it for free.

20
00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.940
Um And if you go to either my website

21
00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.779
or Talbot's website, there'll be links. So you don't,

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.809
don't remember any specifics, you know, just remember one

23
00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.300
of our names and you can find the book

24
00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:14.849
if you decide you're interested in following up after

25
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.260
today.

26
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.029
Great. So uh I'm leaving links to that in

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.720
the description down below by the way. So uh

28
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.809
to start off with before we get into the

29
00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.970
sort of game theory slash psychology of all of

30
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.660
these, and now tackling climate change is a sort

31
00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:37.620
of, let's say global coordinations game. Uh Just to

32
00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:40.800
set up the stage, let me ask you first.

33
00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:45.750
At what point do we find ourselves uh at

34
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.360
right now when it comes to climate change, I,

35
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.099
I mean, how much are we into it? And

36
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.419
what are some of the worst potential effects and

37
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.139
consequences of it?

38
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.410
Yeah. So climate change is this huge complicated problem

39
00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:05.599
and we're unfortunately already seeing the impacts of climate

40
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.050
change. So we're seeing especially more extreme weather, we're

41
00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.570
seeing more severe hurricane seasons, we're seeing longer and

42
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.880
more severe wildfire seasons and as of right now,

43
00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.649
it's mostly just going to get worse. Um But

44
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.350
where we are in fighting climate change is it's

45
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.490
no longer just a technological problem. We know how

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.600
to stop climate change. We have all these tools

47
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.610
available to us. The main challenge now is a

48
00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.729
more political problem. How do we govern and implement

49
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.940
all of these different tools that are available to

50
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.160
us and that's where our work comes. And so

51
00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.669
we're specifically interested in the public side of the

52
00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.350
problem. How do we get everyday people to care

53
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.479
about climate change, to spend money, to support these

54
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.190
often expensive policies. And how do we design policies

55
00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.320
that will most get people involved in paying for

56
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.919
climate change mitigation and disaster prevention?

57
00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.720
And so I I mean, we're going to get

58
00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.639
more into that as we go through the questions

59
00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.820
here, but just uh give us perhaps a brief,

60
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.919
a brief overview of what would be the best

61
00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.649
solutions that we are that we have available right

62
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.639
now. And the uh that are the ones that

63
00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:23.130
we would need to implement and convince people to

64
00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:23.759
implement.

65
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.610
Yeah, unfortunately, there is no one thing that we

66
00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.330
can do that will totally stop climate change. But

67
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.490
thankfully, we have a lot of different tools available

68
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.940
to us. So one thing we absolutely have to

69
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.610
do is we have to reduce the amount of

70
00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.660
electricity we generate from burning fossil fuels. We need

71
00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.000
to be building renewable energy infrastructure like wind power

72
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.490
and solar power, but alone, that's not enough. So

73
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.350
on top of that, we also need to be

74
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.550
building more infrastructure to adapt to the disasters that

75
00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.330
are already happening. We're already feeling some of these

76
00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.369
impacts of climate change. Even if we switch to

77
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.929
completely fossil fuel free electricity today, we would still

78
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.570
face some of those impacts because of inertia in

79
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.710
the climate system. So we also need to be

80
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.169
investing in climate change adaptation and infrastructure. Uh This

81
00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.580
one's a little bit more controversial but we probably

82
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.899
also need to be investing in technologies to help

83
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.320
buy us more time for this transition to renewable

84
00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:25.399
energy. So investing in research on different types of

85
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.420
geoengineering, so technologies that help either temporarily cool the

86
00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.459
planet or that help take carbon dioxide out of

87
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.299
the atmosphere. This doesn't solve the problem of us

88
00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.779
still emitting a lot of fossil fuels, but it

89
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.880
just buys us some more time before we see

90
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.220
the worst impacts of climate change to make that

91
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.609
transition. So it's a huge problem and we're going

92
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.540
to need a whole collection of different solutions. Some

93
00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:49.470
combination of these

94
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.739
things amongst the technological solutions, you will uh I

95
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.320
mean, they would also include the things like renewable

96
00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.339
energy and nuclear power, right.

97
00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.500
Yeah. Anything that will help us reduce the amount

98
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.230
of carbon dioxide that we're emitting.

99
00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:11.000
Yeah. Uh And by the way, when we're talking

100
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.190
about solutions here, what would these solutions be for?

101
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.950
I mean, because uh basically what I'm asking you

102
00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.739
is at this point is climate change still reversible

103
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.329
in any way or are we just talking about

104
00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.070
mitigating climate change?

105
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.720
Yeah, so I'm really optimistic about these things. Um

106
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.019
I maybe would go a little bit insane studying

107
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.929
the problem if I didn't think it was somewhat

108
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.049
reversible. But my read of the science at least

109
00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:42.839
is that it's on my side that it's not

110
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.679
too late to do something, we are certainly going

111
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.609
to see some negative impacts and we already are,

112
00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.049
but we do still have time to reverse some

113
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.399
of the worst impacts of climate change. It's just

114
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.959
going to take a lot of coordinating a lot

115
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.329
of investment to make that happen effectively.

116
00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.739
And uh so getting into the game theoretical side

117
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.700
of things now, why do you call the book

118
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:11.190
Climate Change Global Social Dilemma with the?

119
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.350
Yeah, good question. Um So uh the the first

120
00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.609
thing to understand is the idea of a social

121
00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.070
dilemma is a huge topic going back decades and

122
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:26.524
decades in political science, sociology, psychology, biology. So one

123
00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:30.214
classic example of a social social dilemma is basic

124
00:06:30.225 --> 00:06:32.584
law and order in a society. So, you know,

125
00:06:32.595 --> 00:06:34.915
it's good for each one of us that we

126
00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:37.265
don't have to worry too much that criminals will

127
00:06:37.274 --> 00:06:39.524
assault us or that if we're brought before a

128
00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:42.524
court, we won't be treated fairly. Um So, you

129
00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.515
know, basic law and order is good for everybody.

130
00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.434
But if you think of a fairly large society,

131
00:06:47.445 --> 00:06:49.165
like even just, you know, a state in the

132
00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:50.795
United States, not in the whole country, there's a

133
00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:54.649
state. Um WHEN in order to fund law and

134
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.760
order, you know, we think of taxes pay for

135
00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:59.570
that but you as an individual citizen, your taxes

136
00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.079
are a tiny, tiny drop in a pretty large

137
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.929
bucket. So even though you benefit because crime is

138
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.640
being deterred by the work of police and the

139
00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:12.350
court system, um there's really no individual benefit for

140
00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:14.299
you in paying your taxes. If you withheld your

141
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:18.010
taxes, you'd have that money. And really the courts

142
00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:20.850
would function, the police would function just as before.

143
00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:23.029
So it's, you know, that's so, it's, that's why

144
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.010
it's called a dilemma. It's a social dilemma because

145
00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:27.390
we're all better off when this thing is providing.

146
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:30.109
Um, BUT we, you know, individually, it might make

147
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:32.869
sense if we could somehow shirk uh contributing to

148
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.260
it for the kind of social dilemmas like law

149
00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:38.070
and order or things like national defense, the, the

150
00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:40.529
one, you know, a centralized state like the US

151
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.130
government steps in um you know, makes us pay

152
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.820
taxes and then, you know, that, that solves that

153
00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.000
problem in, in that way. So that's a basic

154
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.339
social dilemma when it comes to the reason we

155
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.679
call um climate change and a mi and emissions,

156
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.640
a global social dilemma is they happen, it ha

157
00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:00.890
it happens beyond the national borders, emissions that are

158
00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:03.559
emitted anywhere in the world are going to affect

159
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.600
the entire world. Um So, and, and it's a

160
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:08.450
social dilemma in many of the same ways, you

161
00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:11.489
know, everyone would benefit if the climate isn't changed.

162
00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:14.570
But if you as an individual, human being, any

163
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:17.510
emissions you make are a high ky drop in

164
00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:20.630
a very large bucket. So just like with your

165
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.399
taxes and law and order, why bother restricting yourself

166
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.149
when it comes to contributing uh emissions that might

167
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.820
change the atmosphere. In fact, even some, some, you

168
00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:33.229
know, the US is not this way, but some

169
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:36.030
countries are small enough that it really doesn't matter

170
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.770
much what they do. Like a pretty small country

171
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.780
with a couple 100,000 people. Their choices aren't gonna

172
00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.010
matter too much compared to huge juggernauts like the

173
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.200
US or China. Now, what makes climate change and

174
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.599
global, you know, emissions a, a difference from law

175
00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:53.750
and order is that there's no centralized government. We

176
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.070
don't live under a one world government. So we

177
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.159
can't look to, I guess there's no single leviathan

178
00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:01.830
that is overseeing us all who can force us

179
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.349
to do something that might be beneficial for everybody.

180
00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:07.250
Um So what that means is that if we're

181
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.650
going to solve a problem, a global social dilemma,

182
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.750
it involves independent actors. In this case, the world

183
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.489
states or the world's nations working together to, to

184
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.630
solve the problem with no one, no one entity

185
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.669
who can, you know, make everyone do something they

186
00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:23.000
might not otherwise want to do.

187
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.630
And I mean, we're probably talking about the largest

188
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.090
scale social co ordination problem that we probably have

189
00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:34.890
at our, in our hands now right now, right?

190
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.770
Because I mean, it would have to involve the

191
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.299
entire globe, it would have to be done on

192
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:45.500
a global scale, right? And there's probably nothing bigger

193
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.219
than that when it comes to social coordinations,

194
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.190
right? Yeah, that's yeah, a lot of what we

195
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.469
explore in the book are all the problems that

196
00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:54.869
come along with the fact that you're trying to

197
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.700
coordinate, you know, people with potentially different interests, different

198
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.849
motivations, different sorts of knowledge, different resources um as

199
00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:05.890
is, you know, the actual case with the world's

200
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.489
countries. Um AND the people in the world. Yeah.

201
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.460
So it's a huge, uh you know, one of

202
00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:12.695
the more complex kind of social and people have

203
00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:16.325
dealt with usually social dilemmas are at best national

204
00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:18.934
or maybe subnation or it might be like, how

205
00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:21.174
do we manage, you know, the a particular fishery

206
00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:23.604
off the uh the coast of Alaska? How do

207
00:10:23.614 --> 00:10:26.705
we manage a water supply like the Colorado River,

208
00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:28.924
which is already, you know, a challenging enough thing,

209
00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:30.804
but this is much, you know, a much bigger

210
00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:33.215
scale than any of those kind of uh you

211
00:10:33.224 --> 00:10:35.804
know, classic real world examples of a social dilemma.

212
00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.950
Mhm A and when we get into the economic

213
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.539
games, we present in the book, we'll probably come

214
00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:45.659
back to uh why doing this at such a

215
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:49.369
scale will is also a complication. But in the

216
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.210
book, you get into some strategic challenges of climate

217
00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:58.599
change. You talked for example about uncertainty, deciding for

218
00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:03.289
others self created disaster, tensions between policymakers and the

219
00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:05.719
public. Could you tell us a little bit about

220
00:11:05.729 --> 00:11:09.000
that? I mean, what are these challenges and how

221
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.520
did you uh come up with them?

222
00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:13.659
Yeah. So the, the reason we came up with

223
00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:17.330
these um is just, you know, there's many challenges

224
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.950
we thought these were ones that were interesting that

225
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.119
were and were tractable to study with the kind

226
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.570
of tech tools we uh we are experts in

227
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.919
using. Uh SO that we're certainly not saying these

228
00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:30.690
are just, these are the only challenges uh that

229
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.380
are involved in the prom. So one of, one

230
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.650
of the, the ones you mentioned is uncertainty. So

231
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.340
um the I PC uh IPCC, the Inter uh

232
00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:42.770
Intergovernmental Panel on climate change, they regularly release reports

233
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.380
where they try to summarize the evidence on various

234
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.640
aspects aspects of climate change. Um A few years

235
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.950
ago, one of their reports said that they have

236
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.190
high confidence that things like tropical cyclones are going

237
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.330
to increase but less confidence for other types of

238
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.080
precipitation due to climate change. So there's different levels

239
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.390
of certainty with various elements of what's gonna happen

240
00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:07.250
uh in the climate. And if we don't exactly

241
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.409
know what the targets are that we're trying to

242
00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:11.489
avoid or things we're trying to hit. So there's

243
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.880
also uncertainty and things like how will a potential

244
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.520
technology work out if you try to scale it?

245
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.239
Like carbon capture and storage? What's you know, what's

246
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.419
gonna, what are the upsides or downsides of that?

247
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.130
What are the upsides of geoengineering or solar radiation

248
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.960
management uh techniques that involve speeding the atmosphere with

249
00:12:29.969 --> 00:12:32.900
aerosols? If we're not sure how these things are

250
00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.729
going to work out or what their effects will

251
00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:38.880
be downstream, it's harder for countries to figure out?

252
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.270
Well, do I want to support this? Do I

253
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.369
not want to support this? Do I care whether

254
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.030
other people are going to support this? So, uncertainty

255
00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:47.659
is a big problem in figuring out what we

256
00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:49.450
should do if I don't know what you're gonna

257
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.169
do? How do I know what I should do?

258
00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:55.840
Um Another problem that we investigate is deciding for

259
00:12:55.849 --> 00:12:58.929
other people. So this is a very common kind

260
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.909
of political problem where often decision makers are at

261
00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:05.510
a remove uh from the people who are gonna

262
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.309
be most affected by their decisions. One example we

263
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.320
use in our book is a tiny little island

264
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.979
nation called Kiribati. In the Pacific. There's about 100,000

265
00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:18.919
people who live on this island country. Um AND

266
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.270
various project projections lead to different numbers, but many

267
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.030
projections suggest the water is gonna ocean is gonna

268
00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:28.780
rise substantially in the vicinity of this island. Several

269
00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:31.429
years ago, the World Bank used the island as

270
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.780
what they call the demonstration project to try to,

271
00:13:33.789 --> 00:13:36.690
you know, to try to show that outside experts

272
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.630
investing millions of dollars can help a small country

273
00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:43.650
uh avoid disaster. One of the things they did

274
00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.429
was to help the country build what are called

275
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.210
sea walls, essentially walls that help stem the water

276
00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:53.440
from, you know, rising water won't get farther inland

277
00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:56.750
and it turned out that the sea walls ended

278
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.784
up being an embarrassing disaster. Uh Some people in

279
00:14:00.794 --> 00:14:03.734
the area called them part of a larger graveyard

280
00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:07.215
of short term investments in infrastructure. And at least

281
00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:09.025
one of the act, one of the reasons people

282
00:14:09.034 --> 00:14:12.215
thought they turned out so poorly is because they

283
00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:14.625
were spearheaded to, to a large degree by people

284
00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:18.315
who were remote, at a distant distant advisors. Uh

285
00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:21.085
Not just not, you know, we didn't have a

286
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:24.255
full understanding of what local people wanted or how

287
00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:27.070
to deal with the local environment. Uh So, you

288
00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.190
know, that's just an example of this larger political

289
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.520
problem. Outsiders often don't have the same knowledge or

290
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.219
motivations of the people who are local. Um YOU

291
00:14:35.229 --> 00:14:37.059
know, people who are working at the World Bank,

292
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.260
they wanna help Kiribati, but they also have the

293
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.590
funders and the bosses above them who are even

294
00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:45.419
more remote and who maybe are pulling them in

295
00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.530
different directions. And this is, you know, a general

296
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:52.239
problem with climate change because often many important decisions

297
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.669
will be made by people who are not especially

298
00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:59.650
um affected by the potential for disaster. So people

299
00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:02.479
in rich, you know, industrial countries will make a

300
00:15:02.489 --> 00:15:04.960
lot of important choices. But it turns out it's

301
00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:08.539
people in, you know, poor developing countries that face

302
00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:12.750
larger risk of disaster. And of course many important

303
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.349
decisions will be made by people who are alive

304
00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:18.349
right now. Uh But it's gonna be mostly people

305
00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:20.799
in the future who are affected. Um So that's,

306
00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:22.669
you know, this, this general problem of you know,

307
00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:24.590
how do we make good decisions? Can we make

308
00:15:24.599 --> 00:15:27.099
good decisions when those of us who are making

309
00:15:27.109 --> 00:15:29.719
these decisions, aren't the people most affected by them?

310
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.130
Uh So let me just ask you one question

311
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.409
about, uh I guess that this would fit into

312
00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:40.669
uncertainty but when it comes to the fact that

313
00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:45.409
it's very hard for us, at least intuitively to

314
00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:51.465
connect uh gas emissions with uh climate change or,

315
00:15:51.474 --> 00:15:54.585
or to climate change. Does uh would that fall

316
00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:57.494
into uncertainty? I mean, because uh for people who

317
00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:02.594
are not scientifically literate, it's really, really hard for

318
00:16:02.604 --> 00:16:07.364
them to understand how would that connection work? Would

319
00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.705
that also play out here or not?

320
00:16:11.469 --> 00:16:12.750
Yeah, I think so. I think that, yeah, I

321
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.200
think that would tie into the same theme of

322
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.190
uncertainty. There's all, there's all sorts of uncertainty, there's

323
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.010
uncertainty in what, how is what we're doing now

324
00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.969
affecting the climate, how are technologies we could roll

325
00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:28.130
out? How do those affect the climate? Um How

326
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.859
does economic choices we make? How are those going

327
00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:33.929
to affect living standard? Um And so there's also

328
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.239
a balancing act between um you know, making good

329
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.909
choices uh that, that aren't going, you know, you,

330
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.169
you're not trying, you don't want to impoverish people

331
00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:44.289
because that's, that, that's kind of defeating the purpose

332
00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:47.080
of solving the problem. Um So there's uncertainty all

333
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.159
the way, I guess, I think we used the

334
00:16:48.169 --> 00:16:50.330
phrase multiple times in the book, uncertainty all the

335
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.369
way down about a lot of these things.

336
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.789
And so why did you decide to focus specifically

337
00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.080
on economic games in the book? What kinds of

338
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.608
knowledge can we get from those types of games

339
00:17:05.618 --> 00:17:09.890
that would be relevant for a co ordination problems

340
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.589
such as climate change?

341
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.739
Yeah. So what you know, one thing we, we

342
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.959
want to make very clear is we're behavioral scientists.

343
00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:18.900
So we're not people who are crunching the numbers

344
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.510
on major economic policy uh policies. We're not the

345
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.630
ones who are directly designing uh uh technology for

346
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.780
engaging in carbon capture and storage. So what we

347
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.619
study is how people think and we want to

348
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.920
study how people think about the problems of climate

349
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.895
change. There's lots of tools that we use other

350
00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:40.464
social sciences use to study how people think about

351
00:17:40.474 --> 00:17:44.645
political issues, things like survey experiments or public opinion

352
00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:47.645
polling or focus groups. Uh What we want to

353
00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:50.685
do is use our comparative advantage. So our research

354
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:54.405
team uh myself Talbot and our co-author uh Ruben

355
00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:57.094
Klein, who couldn't be here today. Um All of

356
00:17:57.104 --> 00:17:59.045
what what all of us do is in addition

357
00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:01.525
to other kinds of techniques we use uh experimental

358
00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:04.569
economic games. So the basic idea of these things,

359
00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:07.459
it's really simple. What you're trying to do is

360
00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:11.369
to simulate in a laboratory, the kinds of strategic

361
00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.520
problems people and politicians face out there in the

362
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.349
real world, but you do it in a laboratory

363
00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:19.890
and in a way that makes it really transparent

364
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.380
to the researcher. So basically, it's you, it's called

365
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.430
a game for a reason. You're literally given a

366
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:29.000
series of rules and you can make choices within

367
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.589
these rules that affect how much money you and

368
00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:34.369
other people earn. So one of the classic games

369
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.650
in this, I'll get two quick examples. One of

370
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.719
the classic games that maybe uh many of your

371
00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:41.410
listeners are familiar with is called the dictator game

372
00:18:41.869 --> 00:18:44.310
in the dictator game. Um We might, if I

373
00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:46.989
was the researcher, I might pair you and tal

374
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.449
it up anonymously through a computer network, randomly pick

375
00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:53.569
one of you give you $10 and say you

376
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.050
can divide this $10 any way you want between

377
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.890
yourself and the other anonymous player. And that's the

378
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.319
simplest possible uh game that people typically study, you

379
00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:03.979
know, how would you divide a fixed sum of

380
00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:06.489
money and then one. So that's, that's it. We

381
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.219
can see what would you do. So if you

382
00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:10.859
give a lot, we might infer that you're generous

383
00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:13.339
or that you're reversed to inequality or if you

384
00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:15.290
keep a lot, we might infer the opposite that

385
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.280
you're stingy or that you're happy with inequality, things

386
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.520
of that nature. And then to make it just

387
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.630
a little bit more complicated, a variation on that

388
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.619
game uh called the ultimatum game simulates bargaining. So

389
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.689
that one's very similar. So in, but instead of

390
00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:32.599
you Ricardo making a, a decision all on your

391
00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:36.069
own. You make a proposal essentially an ultimatum to

392
00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:38.250
Talbot. Uh So you might say out of this

393
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.510
$10 Talbot, I'm gonna give you $1 and keep

394
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.810
nine. And again, this is usually anonymous, but I'll

395
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:46.949
use people's names. So Talbot then considers that proposal

396
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.869
and she might decide. Um, WELL, no, thanks. She

397
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.979
rejects your proposal. And in that case, uh what

398
00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:56.050
happens is essentially the money, you know, bursts in

399
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.420
the fire and disappears. So no one gets anything.

400
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.329
So if you Ricardo don't make a, a uh

401
00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:04.170
a proposal that Talbot's willing to accept, no one

402
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.829
gets anything. Uh And so that's designed to simulate

403
00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:09.910
kind of a high stakes one shot bargaining situation.

404
00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:13.359
So the benefit of this. So, you know, that

405
00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:15.160
we and we'll come to the games we, we

406
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.140
tended to use. But again, the benefit is by

407
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.109
making these things really concrete and very transparent to

408
00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:24.560
the researchers, we can try to understand uh very

409
00:20:24.569 --> 00:20:26.930
what you all are doing. The problem is if

410
00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:28.829
we try to just look at the real world

411
00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.060
now, that's important. Many me, you know, a lot

412
00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:33.439
of useful research does that, but the problem with

413
00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:36.286
the real world is we don't know all the

414
00:20:36.296 --> 00:20:40.026
rules, all the institutions, all the constraints, all the

415
00:20:40.036 --> 00:20:42.836
material incentives or other types of incentives that people

416
00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:45.995
face like a real president making some decision about,

417
00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:49.176
say going to war. We don't know what intelligence

418
00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:52.015
the president had privy to, we don't know what

419
00:20:52.026 --> 00:20:54.546
kinds of pressure groups we're putting the most behind

420
00:20:54.556 --> 00:20:57.232
the scenes, you know, pressure on them, all sorts

421
00:20:57.241 --> 00:20:59.291
of things. We might not know that led to

422
00:20:59.302 --> 00:21:01.312
their decision. So it's important to, you know, to

423
00:21:01.322 --> 00:21:04.891
understand how real presidents make decisions, how real policymakers

424
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:08.511
make decisions. But we like these games because you

425
00:21:08.521 --> 00:21:11.352
can really dig in and see exactly how people

426
00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:14.751
respond to problems that you as a researcher create.

427
00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:17.761
So you know, everything about the little world that

428
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:19.552
your research participants are facing.

429
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.609
But just before we get into the specific kinds

430
00:21:23.619 --> 00:21:26.599
of games you explore in the book, there's perhaps

431
00:21:26.609 --> 00:21:30.160
two sets of important questions here. So the first

432
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.619
one is um I mean, what are the limitations

433
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.479
of these games in terms of how much should

434
00:21:38.489 --> 00:21:43.849
we expect them to really translate into real life?

435
00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:46.310
Right? I mean, because there's all, there's always the

436
00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:50.510
issue when we study things in the lab that

437
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.130
they might not have uh much ecological validity, let's

438
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.650
say that they wouldn't work the same way uh

439
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.949
outside of the lab in an ecologically valid uh

440
00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:08.119
setting, let's say. So, I mean, to what extent

441
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.010
does that criticism apply here?

442
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.469
Yeah, so there's kind of two types of data

443
00:22:13.479 --> 00:22:15.069
that I I would point to. So of course,

444
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:18.180
that's a reasonable worry, very reasonable worry. One type

445
00:22:18.189 --> 00:22:20.790
of data I would point to is a an

446
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.699
obvious concern you might have is uh you know,

447
00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:27.290
I use an example of $10. Now, almost any

448
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.989
real world political problem that we care about has

449
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.430
stakes much bigger than $10. So you might worry

450
00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:36.050
that these games because the stake sizes are gonna

451
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.109
be relatively small on the order of a few

452
00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:41.780
dollars, $10.20 dollars, uh, that they don't, might not

453
00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:45.099
tell us anything. So, researchers actually have tested that.

454
00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:47.959
Um, SOMETIMES, you know, researchers with lots of money

455
00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:50.819
have put pretty big stakes on the line and

456
00:22:50.829 --> 00:22:55.000
you find um not ex not quantitatively identical results,

457
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.369
but people play the game pretty much the same

458
00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.199
way, even if the stake sizes are, are dramatically

459
00:23:00.209 --> 00:23:03.219
a larger, like some great examples of this come

460
00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:06.479
from work uh by anthropologists who took game like

461
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:08.579
the ultimatum game and the dictator game around the

462
00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:12.229
world. And if you're from a, you know, relatively

463
00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:15.930
rich industrialized society yourself with reasonable grant money and

464
00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:18.880
you go to a small scale forging or horticulturalist

465
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.010
society, the kind of money you have available, you're

466
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.869
able to pay what for them might represent the

467
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.479
wages they would earn over a week or even

468
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.050
a month for a single brief session of these

469
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.500
games. When anthropologists do that, they tend to find

470
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.680
some quanti quantitative variation uh society from society, but

471
00:23:37.689 --> 00:23:40.380
broadly speaking, like in the dictator game, um you,

472
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.369
you tend to find that across huge changes in

473
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.770
the type of ecology, the type of the place

474
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.780
in the world people are living, they tend to

475
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.449
give away 25% to 50% of the stake. Um

476
00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:53.469
So they tend to kind of a narrow range

477
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:55.449
they give and again, that's like with a huge

478
00:23:55.459 --> 00:23:57.359
amount of money, sometimes a week or a month

479
00:23:57.369 --> 00:24:00.089
of wages on the line. Um Another way you

480
00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:02.550
could look at like, well, do, what do these

481
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.689
games capture particularly for our purposes? Lay people like

482
00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:10.079
the people who are normal experimental participants, random people

483
00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:13.579
who are willing to participate online or ST undergraduates

484
00:24:13.589 --> 00:24:16.449
at a university, they're not the people who are

485
00:24:16.459 --> 00:24:19.380
in the room when governments make big decisions, right?

486
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.420
So you might worry that lay people don't behave

487
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.900
like politicians. Uh But other political scientists have taken

488
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.239
the gains similar to the ones I've been talking

489
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.900
about or other kind of decision tasks that, you

490
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.640
know, um that psychologists have studied for decades on,

491
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.020
on lay people and have asked various samples of

492
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.459
actual politicians to play these games or other people

493
00:24:41.469 --> 00:24:43.834
who are uh elites in some way or another,

494
00:24:43.844 --> 00:24:46.535
maybe not politicians themselves, but people who might have

495
00:24:46.545 --> 00:24:48.734
worked at the state department or worked in major

496
00:24:48.744 --> 00:24:51.484
corporations. And when you do this, you also, you

497
00:24:51.494 --> 00:24:53.694
find that these people tend to play the game

498
00:24:53.704 --> 00:24:57.935
again, not literally identically with laypeople but broadly in

499
00:24:57.944 --> 00:24:59.844
the same way. Um So if you, you know,

500
00:24:59.854 --> 00:25:03.025
if you drive, you Ricardo a layperson, drive a

501
00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:05.324
hard bargain and most people might drive a hard

502
00:25:05.334 --> 00:25:07.834
bargain, then these elites will drive a hard bargain

503
00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:11.069
in a similarly constructed game. So those are kind

504
00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.780
of two kinds of evidence. I would point to

505
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.719
that suggest um these games are to the typical

506
00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:19.920
way these games are played for laypeople playing for

507
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.930
smallish stakes are still likely to capture um at

508
00:25:23.939 --> 00:25:26.260
least some important elements about the real world. One

509
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.410
thing you that it is more difficult to create

510
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.000
in the game just real briefly would be to

511
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.410
create long term identities that are important to people.

512
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.829
I can't tell people to just suddenly be a

513
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:40.219
Democrat or be a Republican when playing my game,

514
00:25:40.229 --> 00:25:42.069
if that's not who they are in real life,

515
00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:45.020
right? Uh So those kind of issues are, are

516
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.300
difficult to experimentally create. Although of course, you can

517
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.319
bring in Democrats and see how they play or

518
00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:53.380
bring in Republicans, but you can't easily create these

519
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.050
long term enduring identities in a game or like

520
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.380
nationalities. Of course. So if you're interested in that,

521
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.140
you can, you can study people, but you can't

522
00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.900
exactly create that in the same way, we can

523
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.150
create a similar acronym of trying to cooper uh

524
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.180
for mutual benefits. So I think those are, you

525
00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:11.969
know, those are there are, you know, this is

526
00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:14.109
why we shouldn't, we're not saying you should only

527
00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:16.310
use games. It's just this one source of data

528
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.829
that, you know, we think that's our comparative advantage

529
00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:21.369
here is to use that to understand how climate

530
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.790
uh people think about the climate.

531
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:26.630
Uh But then, uh I mean, to what extent

532
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.310
should we expect the results of these games to

533
00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:34.589
uh scale up in the sense that they would

534
00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:38.390
apply to? Uh I mean, in this case, a

535
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.329
global, potentially a global scale because that's the scale

536
00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:45.849
we're talking about here uh be because I mean,

537
00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:50.030
you mentioned for example, politicians and also regular people,

538
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.989
but we need both and ideally the entire world

539
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.349
in the sort of coordinations game. So uh to

540
00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:02.119
what extent can we say that for example, the

541
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.670
results we get from uh making people play these

542
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.880
games in the lab and in different kinds of

543
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.910
controlled settings would uh scale up, let's say,

544
00:27:16.689 --> 00:27:18.750
yeah. So I, I think what I would say

545
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.829
about this is the mechanisms that we observe in

546
00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:25.949
the lab, we believe persist outside of the lab.

547
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.130
But there are all sorts of other mechanisms that

548
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.560
we're holding constant within the lab that are then

549
00:27:31.569 --> 00:27:33.790
operating outside of the lab. And so I I

550
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.989
think that the things we observe and the insights

551
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.359
that we find are real and they persist. The

552
00:27:39.369 --> 00:27:42.449
more complicated question is how do they interact with

553
00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:44.449
the other things happening in the world that might

554
00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:47.459
shape that behavior? Um But so one example of

555
00:27:47.469 --> 00:27:50.079
this in some of my own ongoing work, I'm

556
00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:52.719
now asking people to contribute real money, not to

557
00:27:52.729 --> 00:27:56.709
prevent simulated disaster, but to contribute real money to

558
00:27:56.719 --> 00:28:00.430
actual charities after disaster to engage in that kind

559
00:28:00.439 --> 00:28:03.015
of relief in the insights that we find from

560
00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:06.744
the book are persisting outside of the lab. And

561
00:28:06.755 --> 00:28:10.135
so not only would we say you shouldn't only

562
00:28:10.145 --> 00:28:12.744
do econ games, but we as researchers are also

563
00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:16.305
engaged in taking those insights to other methods and

564
00:28:16.314 --> 00:28:18.885
are observing that those mechanisms are still working.

565
00:28:20.469 --> 00:28:24.290
And which kinds of specific economic games do you

566
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.680
think better capture the aspects of social coordinations that

567
00:28:28.689 --> 00:28:32.170
are most relevant to solving climate change?

568
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.060
Yeah. So we we specifically rely on a threshold

569
00:28:37.069 --> 00:28:39.500
public goods game, we call it the disaster game.

570
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.239
And uh we'll talk a little bit more about

571
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.150
that in a minute. Um But to use a

572
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.640
pretty famous quote that I love very much, all

573
00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.920
models are wrong, but some models are useful from

574
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.410
George Box, right? So kind change is a huge

575
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.839
complicated problem and we are specifically interested in the

576
00:28:57.849 --> 00:29:00.890
social dilemma nature of climate change and how do

577
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.780
we get people to contribute despite there being an

578
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.390
incentive to free ride off of everybody else's contributions.

579
00:29:07.589 --> 00:29:10.609
So in this case, a modified public goods game

580
00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:14.390
makes sense because it captures that social dilemma. But

581
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.489
there are other dimensions of the climate problem that

582
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.910
could be modeled with very different types of experiments

583
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.800
that I think would also give us insights into

584
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.979
the problem. So for example, other people have brought

585
00:29:25.989 --> 00:29:29.839
up that climate change is also a distributive problem

586
00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:32.819
who's going to pay for climate change and also

587
00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:35.770
who's going to benefit from climate change, climate change

588
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.739
mitigation isn't just costly. It also creates all sorts

589
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.640
of benefits for all sorts of different types of

590
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.380
people. And so there's room for very, very different

591
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.910
types of games that could also give us insights

592
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.010
into the problem just because the scale of the

593
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.219
problem is so big.

594
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.630
And so let's perhaps explore some of the specific

595
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.260
kinds of issues that these games could apply to.

596
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.420
And I mean, the different kinds of factors that

597
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:07.869
play a role in how we coordinate our behaviors

598
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.310
when it comes to tackling climate change. So uh

599
00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:13.979
in the book, at a certain point, you talk

600
00:30:13.989 --> 00:30:18.119
about how we can use the disaster game specifically

601
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.050
to study how people respond to different technologies to

602
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.515
stop climate change. So, uh I mean, could you

603
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:30.035
tell us a little bit about that, which factors

604
00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:34.114
play a role in this specific case and what

605
00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:37.265
tend to be the kinds of reactions that people

606
00:30:37.484 --> 00:30:40.854
uh have to this kind of game

607
00:30:40.864 --> 00:30:42.814
here? Sure, tell me, do you want to lead

608
00:30:42.824 --> 00:30:45.314
us through the basic game? And I'll take on

609
00:30:45.324 --> 00:30:47.984
like how one of the earlier studies we did

610
00:30:47.994 --> 00:30:48.795
on technology?

611
00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:51.530
Yeah. So just to give you a foundation of

612
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.310
what does the disaster game look like, um the

613
00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:57.189
way it works is that players are in groups

614
00:30:57.199 --> 00:30:59.989
of 4 to 6 people depending on the experiment.

615
00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:04.079
Uh And together, they face an oncoming simulated disaster

616
00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:06.770
that's going to destroy their money that they have

617
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.310
at the start of the game. They have to

618
00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:13.420
simultaneously uh decide whether and how much they're going

619
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.439
to contribute to disaster prevention. If together they contribute

620
00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:20.400
enough, then disaster stopped. They get to keep the

621
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.199
remaining money. Um If they don't contribute enough disaster,

622
00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:27.060
still strikes. And either way, whatever they've contributed to

623
00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:31.079
disaster prevention is gone forever. So the basics of

624
00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:34.599
this game captures two of the most important dimensions

625
00:31:34.609 --> 00:31:37.020
of the climate problem. So first, it's a social

626
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.719
dilemma, everybody's better off if they contribute enough money

627
00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:43.969
to stop the disaster. But everybody also has an

628
00:31:43.979 --> 00:31:46.550
incentive to contribute nothing and hope the rest of

629
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.369
their group will carry the burden of stopping disaster.

630
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.239
And then second, it captures this threshold nature of

631
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.989
climate change. And I think this is really important

632
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.890
in two different ways. So first thinking broadly about

633
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.560
the climate problem, you've probably heard if global mean

634
00:32:01.569 --> 00:32:05.449
temperature rise exceeds two °C, this is where we're

635
00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:09.089
certainly going to see more and worse damages. So

636
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.229
there's not a linear relationship between how much carbon

637
00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:15.130
dioxide we emit and how bad climate change is

638
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.520
going to be. There are these tipping points in

639
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.079
the system where if we pass these tipping points,

640
00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:22.160
things are going to get a lot worse, much

641
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.319
more quickly and potentially be irreversible. And so that

642
00:32:25.329 --> 00:32:29.310
threshold captures that dimension on a more local level,

643
00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:33.390
this is also important um building half a levy

644
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.859
to prevent a flood, doesn't prevent half a flood,

645
00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:39.900
right? You have to actually finish building this kind

646
00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.310
of prevention, infrastructure to reap those benefits. And so

647
00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:45.689
that's what the disaster game is meant to capture.

648
00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:48.069
And then throughout the book, we have all sorts

649
00:32:48.079 --> 00:32:50.550
of different ways that we change that basic framework

650
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.869
to answer all of these questions. So Andy, do

651
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.510
you wanna take it away with the first?

652
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.420
Yeah. So one of our, one of the first

653
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.560
projects we worked on as a team, um The

654
00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:02.160
kind of the starting point was that organizations like

655
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.060
the Intergovernmental panel on climate change, the IPCC, they,

656
00:33:06.069 --> 00:33:09.880
they argue that uh we're not going to decelerate

657
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.069
temperature rises fast enough if we use kind of

658
00:33:12.079 --> 00:33:15.359
straightforward mitigation, um we're gonna have to use, they,

659
00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:16.939
they argue at least that we might need to

660
00:33:16.949 --> 00:33:20.719
consider technologies like carbon capture and storage. So we're

661
00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:23.250
not gonna just omit less. We might have to,

662
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.449
for instance, suck some carbon out of the air.

663
00:33:25.959 --> 00:33:29.140
And in a sense, these technologies are risky. Uh

664
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.420
Not because they might blow up in a nuclear

665
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.119
holocaust or something, but because they have potentially high

666
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.150
upsides, but no one's ever scaled them before. So

667
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.060
it could be a lot of investment that just

668
00:33:41.069 --> 00:33:43.900
Peters out and leads nowhere. So we need to,

669
00:33:43.969 --> 00:33:46.800
the I PC IPCC argues we need to try

670
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.579
them but you know, maybe they'll be a dead

671
00:33:49.589 --> 00:33:53.849
end. Um So what we wanted to know is,

672
00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:57.729
will, you know, will people be able to integrate

673
00:33:57.939 --> 00:34:00.050
the problems they face? Like how, you know, t

674
00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:02.540
Talbot mentioned, this is like a threshold, how high

675
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.180
is the threshold with how much risk they're willing

676
00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:08.260
to bear in order to try to meet that

677
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.510
threshold. So again, imagine yourself in one of our

678
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.228
games, you're in a four person team. Um And

679
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.358
we tell you, you each got some money and

680
00:34:16.368 --> 00:34:18.009
uh let's say you have, you know, you have

681
00:34:18.018 --> 00:34:23.178
$20 and the way that you can prevent disaster

682
00:34:23.188 --> 00:34:26.748
is by contributing to this threshold, we give you

683
00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:29.888
a monetary amount. But um we give you two

684
00:34:29.898 --> 00:34:32.378
ways to contribute. If you want to contribute, you

685
00:34:32.388 --> 00:34:35.780
can just give your money directly or you can

686
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.500
basically put it into a slot machine and if

687
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.418
you win your money is doubled, but if you

688
00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.620
lose your money just disappears. So the idea is

689
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:47.580
that this is sort of simulating the contrast between,

690
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.969
you know, more traditional mitigation ideas like making more

691
00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:54.219
windmills or uh finding ways to emit less by

692
00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:57.379
more efficient vehicles or something of that nature versus

693
00:34:57.389 --> 00:34:59.639
this sort of big picture big, you know, kind

694
00:34:59.649 --> 00:35:02.129
of go go big or go home technology where

695
00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:04.780
maybe it will pay off, but maybe the investment

696
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.929
will just go Kaput. Uh So will people uh

697
00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.949
you know, how will people decide how to invest

698
00:35:09.959 --> 00:35:12.770
their money between these two forms. So the what

699
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.570
we did then in these experiments was again, if

700
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.860
you were in our group, imagine, you know, there's

701
00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:19.699
uh ever if you, some groups have a really

702
00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:22.750
low threshold where it's easy to just contribute some

703
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.580
money directly and you can probably meet the problem.

704
00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:27.800
Other groups are giving a higher and higher and

705
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.860
higher threshold. And if you do the math, um

706
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.739
you know, some very complex math, you would discover

707
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.620
that it's probably in your interest then as a

708
00:35:35.629 --> 00:35:38.179
group to have a lot of people engage in

709
00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:41.629
these risky investments. And so we wondered whether normal

710
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.510
people who were the ones who they don't make

711
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.659
the decisions in the big rooms with presidents, but

712
00:35:45.669 --> 00:35:47.840
they are the ones who elect presidents and prime

713
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.959
ministers. So their opinion still matters quite a bit.

714
00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:53.500
Would they understand this problem and being, uh, you

715
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.449
know, be, be willing to engage in risk to

716
00:35:56.459 --> 00:36:00.580
solve ever higher thresholds? So, um, that's what we

717
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.360
did. We tested whether people could do that and

718
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.399
we actually, there's different kind of theories out there.

719
00:36:04.409 --> 00:36:07.919
Some theories are pretty pessimistic about people's abilities to

720
00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:12.860
reason correctly about risk and about complex decisions. Um,

721
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.969
BUT, uh our back, some of my background and

722
00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:17.909
Talbot's background is both, uh, we're from partially trained

723
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:21.419
in evolutionary psychology and it turns out that evolutionary

724
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:25.143
biologists, um, and, and psychologists have discovered animals and

725
00:36:25.153 --> 00:36:28.982
humans are actually really good at balancing riskiness with

726
00:36:28.992 --> 00:36:31.752
the kinds of thresholds that they face. So we

727
00:36:31.762 --> 00:36:33.693
were, we were thinking that people would actually be

728
00:36:33.702 --> 00:36:35.853
pretty good at this problem. And in fact, the

729
00:36:35.863 --> 00:36:38.452
quality of their decisions astounded even us, even though

730
00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:41.163
we were already kind of optimistic, people were really

731
00:36:41.193 --> 00:36:44.072
sensitive to the threshold and did a very good

732
00:36:44.083 --> 00:36:47.446
job of balancing which kind of investment to make,

733
00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:50.196
depending on just how difficult meeting that threshold would

734
00:36:50.206 --> 00:36:53.885
be. Um So, you know, uh basically, when people,

735
00:36:53.895 --> 00:36:57.885
when averting disaster became ever more difficult, people were

736
00:36:57.895 --> 00:37:01.166
more likely to, you know, take a gamble on

737
00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:04.406
this sort of a stylized choice meant to simulate

738
00:37:04.416 --> 00:37:08.476
real world uh technology like carbon capture and storage.

739
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.189
Uh So, but uh I mean, tell us perhaps

740
00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:19.570
about specific kinds of technologies that you've studied in

741
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.510
these games and I mean, what kinds of reactions

742
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.530
do people tend to have to them?

743
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.370
Yeah. So in other work, what we've looked at,

744
00:37:29.379 --> 00:37:31.219
so this is that was a study on like

745
00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:34.850
carbon capture and storage. Um We've also done ones

746
00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.750
that are designed to to more simulate things like

747
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:42.030
um uh solar radiation management, a fancy word for

748
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.050
doing any doing things in the atmosphere to reflect

749
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.189
light back into space. So one kind of thing

750
00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:51.320
that's actually in the grand scheme of things relatively

751
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.389
cheap is seeding the atmosphere with aerosols or other

752
00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:57.409
types of chemicals that could reflect light back into

753
00:37:57.419 --> 00:38:02.030
space. Um And that's risky in a different way.

754
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.929
So I mentioned the carbon capture stuff. The big

755
00:38:04.939 --> 00:38:07.560
risk of that is it just doesn't pay off,

756
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.169
but when it comes to messing with the atmosphere

757
00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:13.770
in other ways, adding more chemicals in the air,

758
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.790
they're supposed to redirect light. Uh THAT could, there's

759
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.550
various, you know, worries that that could change other

760
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.550
aspects like weather patterns throughout the world. So not

761
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.459
only could that simply fail, that could actually back

762
00:38:25.564 --> 00:38:28.375
fire um and hurt people. Um And if you

763
00:38:28.385 --> 00:38:30.604
try to implement that. And so in some of

764
00:38:30.614 --> 00:38:32.955
our studies, we tried to simulate that kind of

765
00:38:32.965 --> 00:38:35.784
problem where you have the choice of a technology

766
00:38:35.794 --> 00:38:39.375
that could actively hurt other people. And what we

767
00:38:39.385 --> 00:38:40.804
did there was you would play in these groups

768
00:38:40.814 --> 00:38:44.270
as before in one version of the experiment, you

769
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.229
would have to make your decisions just as a

770
00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:49.510
group. Um Another version there would be oh and

771
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.010
and one person would be one person in your

772
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.510
group would also have the option of uh choosing

773
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.370
whether to try, you know, to basically see the

774
00:38:57.379 --> 00:39:00.030
atmosphere with these aerosols. So we're, we're kind of

775
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.270
proceeding along two tracks. Everyone in the group can

776
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.590
try to just directly contribute to, you know, this

777
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.229
threshold. Another person can try like a silver bullet

778
00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.419
that might meet the threshold immediately, but it could

779
00:39:12.429 --> 00:39:15.219
backfire and literally it hurt everyone in the group.

780
00:39:15.879 --> 00:39:18.219
So that's one version of the experiment in another

781
00:39:18.229 --> 00:39:20.419
version of the experiment just like what I said.

782
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.120
Except the person who gets to decide whether there's

783
00:39:23.129 --> 00:39:26.580
geoengineering is a total outsider to the group. So

784
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.000
they have no role in the group whatsoever. They

785
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.840
don't suffer any personal costs or benefits whatsoever. So,

786
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.689
you know, maybe they won't care enough to make

787
00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.540
a good decision or maybe they even be too

788
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.469
risk taking. Maybe they're just like hell, yeah, let's

789
00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:43.030
just do this and see what happens. But in

790
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.979
fact, when we, and when we run these experiments,

791
00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:49.679
people in the outsider role do exactly what insiders

792
00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:52.280
would have done in their place. So insiders are

793
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.110
pretty good about picking when to use or not

794
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.050
use geoengineering based on things like the size of

795
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.209
the threshold, uh outsiders just as thoughtful, just as

796
00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:04.820
sensitive, they do exactly what insiders would have wanted

797
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.629
them to do. So that's not. So that's, you

798
00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:09.639
know, another kind of technology um that we've tried

799
00:40:09.649 --> 00:40:13.300
to simulate in the lab. And also um uh

800
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.699
you know, example of like this, the theme of

801
00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:18.219
making decisions on behalf of other people too.

802
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:24.010
Uh So that's about the technological side of things.

803
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.610
But uh how about helping other groups of people?

804
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.620
I mean, how do you study that through economic

805
00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:35.610
games? And what kinds of results uh do you

806
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:35.989
get?

807
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.189
Yeah. So real briefly, you know, the, the earlier

808
00:40:39.199 --> 00:40:41.429
games I I mentioned. So the ones where uh

809
00:40:41.469 --> 00:40:44.580
it's about capturing a car uh excuse me, uh

810
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.120
carbon capture and storage. So those ones we initially

811
00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.739
had people play just on their own behalf. So

812
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.439
you have to delicately manage the size of your

813
00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:57.159
threshold and whether you contribute directly to it or

814
00:40:57.169 --> 00:40:58.879
will you take a gamble? Will you play a

815
00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:02.399
slot machine in other work? Um What we did

816
00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:05.000
was very simple, tweak. We had some people continue

817
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.840
to do that as before and we had other

818
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:11.300
people, uh, who were, uh, told you're gonna make

819
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.850
these decisions, but they're only going to affect a

820
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.209
bunch of strangers, they're not going to affect you

821
00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:19.080
directly. So just like the games where things could

822
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.489
backfire with the uh aerosols in the air here,

823
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.179
similar kind of deal where a bunch of outsiders

824
00:41:25.189 --> 00:41:28.370
have to make decisions for insiders. But the the

825
00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:30.600
difference here is this is back to a group

826
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.489
of people. So now it's not just you in

827
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.790
isolation being like the president making decisions, you're back

828
00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.760
to a group. There's still this kind of social

829
00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.699
dilemma aspect, but it's a social dilemma that impacts

830
00:41:40.709 --> 00:41:43.800
other people. So what do you do? Well, surpri

831
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.159
like, like this is many points in our research

832
00:41:46.169 --> 00:41:50.379
program, we were frankly shocked at how nice and

833
00:41:50.389 --> 00:41:53.310
uh strategic people were. So in our games where

834
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.959
the group making these decisions about whether to take

835
00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:59.030
a gamble or not, they were just as happy

836
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.120
to contribute to a bunch of strangers as to

837
00:42:02.129 --> 00:42:04.429
contribute to preventing their own disaster. So they were

838
00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:08.260
very generous with helping other people prevent disaster. That's

839
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.560
interesting. But you might wonder. Well, are they not

840
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.489
good at doing that though? Do they not pay

841
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.560
as much attention when they're doing it for other

842
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.169
people? But no, they were just as uh accurate

843
00:42:19.179 --> 00:42:22.360
at, you know, t trading their riskiness with the

844
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.659
quality of the, the difficulty of the problem they

845
00:42:24.669 --> 00:42:27.590
faced. So whether you're making decisions for yourself or

846
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.979
for others, um, people were just as good as

847
00:42:29.989 --> 00:42:33.050
managing this kind of multiple kind of technological problems.

848
00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:35.800
So again, we were frankly kind of surprised how,

849
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.639
how kind and, and good people were at making

850
00:42:38.649 --> 00:42:39.360
these decisions.

851
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.590
Ok. So I guess that's already some reason for

852
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.760
optimism. But uh le let's talk now about the

853
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:53.050
fact that as you mentioned earlier here, uh most

854
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.219
of the costs are going to be paid very

855
00:42:57.229 --> 00:43:02.350
unfortunately by more vulnerable people, people from poorer countries.

856
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.540
So how willing are people? Uh I mean, uh

857
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.399
what extent are they willing to go in order

858
00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:13.070
to avoid disaster for other people? I mean, they've

859
00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.360
also said that. So what do we know about

860
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.560
it?

861
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.800
So, yeah, we do have some data on that

862
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:21.810
with these are some studies with our colleagues, Alessandro

863
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.719
Delponte and Nick Seltzer along with our, our, the

864
00:43:24.729 --> 00:43:27.159
colleague who wrote this book with us Ruben Klein.

865
00:43:27.379 --> 00:43:30.820
Um WHAT we tested in those studies was, would

866
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.870
people in these kind of games be willing to

867
00:43:33.879 --> 00:43:36.870
constrain their own behavior to, you know, kind of

868
00:43:36.879 --> 00:43:40.979
pass up benefits to prevent other people from experiencing

869
00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:43.629
disaster. So let me make this concrete in these

870
00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:45.989
games. We sort of, we tried to simulate sort

871
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.560
of the broad sweep of human history where at

872
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.149
one stage of world history, we engaged in economic

873
00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:55.469
development and industrialization where you know, you could take

874
00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:57.750
some, you could essentially in our game. We simulated

875
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.600
that by just saying, hey, you can take some

876
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.520
money from a common pool if you want, just

877
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.889
take some cash totally cool. The problem is the

878
00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:08.229
more cash you take at that early industrialization, economic

879
00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:11.330
development stage. In a later stage of the game,

880
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.310
you're gonna play the disaster game. And when you

881
00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.729
face that, you know, we have this threshold problem

882
00:44:16.739 --> 00:44:18.780
can you can you meet the threshold to prevent

883
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.129
disaster from coming. Well, the more you take earlier,

884
00:44:22.629 --> 00:44:25.100
the higher the threshold gets. So there's sort of

885
00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:29.870
this balancing act between um you know, industrializing and

886
00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:32.709
make have an economic development versus some sort of

887
00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.770
economic uh environmental problems that you create later on.

888
00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:38.909
So in one version of the game, you yourself

889
00:44:38.919 --> 00:44:41.340
have to balance those two problems, your group has

890
00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.969
to. So there, you know, we using some game

891
00:44:43.979 --> 00:44:46.820
theory math, we could predict, you know, what, how

892
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.479
much people should uh take from in the earlier

893
00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:53.570
stage of industrialization in order to sort of maximize

894
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.860
their earnings across both of these stages. That's, that's

895
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.979
easy. Uh But the problem is that's not the

896
00:44:58.989 --> 00:45:01.290
real world. It's different sets of people who are

897
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.080
facing these two different kinds of choices. So we

898
00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:08.409
also had a condition where uh earlier different sets

899
00:45:08.419 --> 00:45:11.770
of people are harvesting money in the economic development

900
00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.520
stage and a separate set faces the environmental threshold

901
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:19.219
problem that was created by the earlier people. So

902
00:45:19.229 --> 00:45:21.270
what we found was unlike some of our other

903
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.189
results, people didn't literally play uh exactly as they

904
00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:27.459
would want to have played for themselves. They did

905
00:45:27.469 --> 00:45:30.679
take some more money, but they, they were relatively

906
00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:32.530
constrained in how much they took. So they were

907
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.169
pretty good about not sending like a ridiculously hard

908
00:45:36.179 --> 00:45:39.449
problem on to future generations. So that's, that's, you

909
00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:42.409
know, kind of a, a reassuring finding. And one

910
00:45:42.419 --> 00:45:44.780
of the things we did too was most of,

911
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.110
you know, some of our people are students playing

912
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.830
in our lab in the uh in New York.

913
00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:52.699
On one version though we had people playing online

914
00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.379
uh Americans who are either creating problems for other

915
00:45:56.389 --> 00:46:00.379
Americans or Americans creating problems that were then sent

916
00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:03.379
to players in India. So a different country entirely

917
00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:05.080
on the other side of the world. So you

918
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.719
might think when they send them to a totally

919
00:46:06.729 --> 00:46:10.360
different nationality, they stop caring as much. In fact,

920
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:13.280
that didn't make any difference whatsoever. People were just

921
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.169
as circumspect in creating environmental problems where they were,

922
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.439
they sent it to Cocom Patriots um versus, you

923
00:46:20.449 --> 00:46:23.800
know, an out group member on another continent. So,

924
00:46:23.959 --> 00:46:26.580
um you know, again another set of like findings

925
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.939
that sort of astounded us and how like quality,

926
00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:31.870
the quality of people's decisions and how reasonably generous

927
00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:32.479
they were.

928
00:46:34.179 --> 00:46:38.840
But another very relevant question here is as individual

929
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:42.840
citizens, it would also be ideal if we changed

930
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.050
some of our habits and particularly people in more

931
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.034
developed countries because we consume more and we have

932
00:46:50.044 --> 00:46:55.044
certain luxuries that we don't want to abdicate. I

933
00:46:55.054 --> 00:46:59.175
mean, how willing are we to constrain ourselves a

934
00:46:59.185 --> 00:47:03.475
bit more to avoid uh emissions? I mean, how

935
00:47:03.485 --> 00:47:05.074
do we study that?

936
00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:10.600
Uh HM I don't know if we directly studied

937
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.090
that particular question. We studied other questions that involve

938
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:18.370
inequality between people but not whether inequality between people

939
00:47:18.379 --> 00:47:21.949
uh leads them to constrain themselves. Uh MORE, more

940
00:47:21.959 --> 00:47:23.750
or less. Yeah, Talbot, do you have any thoughts

941
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.149
on that?

942
00:47:25.159 --> 00:47:27.620
So that we have not done this work? There

943
00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:30.229
is interesting work taking place outside of the lab

944
00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:33.050
on how do you get everyday people to actually

945
00:47:33.659 --> 00:47:37.649
ait less? And it, it's a huge complicated problem

946
00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:40.389
um with some fantastic work that's more focused on

947
00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:41.929
what are people doing in their day to day

948
00:47:41.939 --> 00:47:42.679
lives.

949
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.939
So uh another topic then would be uh tensions

950
00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:55.550
between leaders and citizens and their relationship. So uh

951
00:47:55.590 --> 00:48:00.020
when it comes to the more, let's say economic

952
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:04.719
or game theoretical aspect or approach to this question,

953
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:08.060
I mean, how do you approach it? And what

954
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.729
are some of the most important aspects to tackle

955
00:48:11.739 --> 00:48:12.060
here.

956
00:48:12.919 --> 00:48:15.959
Yeah. So here, what we're really interested is the

957
00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:19.699
interface between publics and elites. So when does the

958
00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:24.399
public trust elites to deliver effective mitigation policy? And

959
00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:28.760
when do elites trust the public to behave accordingly

960
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.500
and to support those effective mitigation policies? So to

961
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.679
be clear in these experiments, we hold aside climate

962
00:48:34.689 --> 00:48:38.145
change denial, we hold aside partisan polarization and really

963
00:48:38.155 --> 00:48:42.604
focus on how different institutions might change people's trust.

964
00:48:42.614 --> 00:48:45.875
So take, for example, from the public side, the

965
00:48:45.885 --> 00:48:49.735
case of disaster prevention, um there's this big puzzle

966
00:48:49.745 --> 00:48:53.324
in the literature that finds the public tends not

967
00:48:53.334 --> 00:48:56.804
actually to be very supportive of disaster prevention spending,

968
00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.129
which is a huge problem. Um Disaster prevention spending

969
00:49:00.139 --> 00:49:02.969
is much more economically efficient than just spending on

970
00:49:02.979 --> 00:49:06.250
relief after a disaster happens. But there are also

971
00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.459
all sorts of things that you can't bring back

972
00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:12.780
that you could have prevented. So for example, loss

973
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.679
of life, you can save people with disaster prevention,

974
00:49:15.689 --> 00:49:18.510
but you can't bring someone back after a disaster

975
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.070
has struck. And this has been historically, largely interpreted

976
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.679
as evidence that voters are just not that sophisticated

977
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.820
that they don't realize they would be much better

978
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.780
off if they were spending on disaster prevention. But

979
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:34.679
there's another possibility. Um So the problem with disaster

980
00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:39.399
prevention is it's hard to know how bad would

981
00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:43.489
a disaster have been without the prevention because we

982
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.129
just don't observe that world the way with relief

983
00:49:46.139 --> 00:49:48.540
I can see like there is a person getting

984
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.600
rescued and there are like firemen coming and dealing

985
00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.409
with this problem. You just don't get the same

986
00:49:54.419 --> 00:49:58.179
thing with disaster prevention and this is especially problematic

987
00:49:58.189 --> 00:50:01.179
when politicians have a lot of discretion over those

988
00:50:01.189 --> 00:50:04.699
prevention funds. Um So one of my favorite examples

989
00:50:04.709 --> 00:50:08.739
of this, the mayor of Kingfisher Oklahoma, which is

990
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.909
this tiny little town in Oklahoma that's built between

991
00:50:11.919 --> 00:50:14.939
these two rivers that floods every few years. He

992
00:50:14.949 --> 00:50:18.090
got this huge grant from the state of Oklahoma

993
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.760
to deal with this cyclical flooding that the town

994
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.560
had. And he took the money and just um

995
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.270
bought out all of his own businesses that were

996
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.129
on the floodplain and used his own construction company

997
00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:31.260
to do that. And it was one of those

998
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.340
cases where this is disaster prevention, but it's much

999
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:37.620
harder for the public to pay attention to that,

1000
00:50:37.629 --> 00:50:39.520
the way that they can with relief and to

1001
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.189
monitor that. And so what we did to test

1002
00:50:42.199 --> 00:50:44.570
this to test whether voters just don't realize they

1003
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.260
should be investing in prevention or whether they're worried

1004
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:49.939
about that kind of corruption. And taking advantage of

1005
00:50:49.949 --> 00:50:53.939
the spending is we ran experiments where we introduced

1006
00:50:53.949 --> 00:50:56.399
a leader. So the way that this worked is

1007
00:50:56.409 --> 00:50:59.459
that players didn't know exactly how much it costs

1008
00:50:59.469 --> 00:51:03.000
to prevent disaster and their leader does know and

1009
00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.020
then their leader tells them like, hey, it's actually

1010
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.590
pretty inexpensive or I'm sorry, but disaster prevention is

1011
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.000
just going to be really expensive. And we essentially

1012
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.520
manipulated whether the leader had an incentive to be

1013
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.909
corrupt, could they skim money off the top? And

1014
00:51:18.919 --> 00:51:21.959
we find that players are incredibly sensitive to this,

1015
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.070
that they're much more trusting of leaders who don't

1016
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.570
have that incentive to behave in a corrupt kind

1017
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.189
of way that essentially these funds are pre committed.

1018
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:32.949
The leader doesn't get to skim. And in this

1019
00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:37.149
instance, voters really support disaster prevention policy. And so

1020
00:51:37.159 --> 00:51:39.800
we interpret this much more optimistically that some of

1021
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.929
these roadblocks to getting voters to support climate change

1022
00:51:42.939 --> 00:51:46.780
mitigation and to support disaster prevention aren't because they

1023
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.830
just don't realize it's important. But instead it's an

1024
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.489
opportunity to design institutions that will increase support for

1025
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.820
this kind of spending. Um From the leader side,

1026
00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:01.010
we were also curious whether leaders could anticipate this

1027
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.889
kind of sophistication. And we looked at this in

1028
00:52:03.899 --> 00:52:06.280
a slightly different domain. So we looked at this

1029
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.560
again with the case of geoengineering and solar radiation

1030
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:13.419
management. Um A big concern in the policy space

1031
00:52:13.429 --> 00:52:17.840
is that if we deploy geoengineering, if we research

1032
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:22.260
geoengineering, if we even talk about geoengineering that basically

1033
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.679
people will stop supporting climate change mitigation, they'll say

1034
00:52:25.689 --> 00:52:28.750
like, oh I trust this. Um LIKE wild technology

1035
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.149
is just going to solve the problem. So why

1036
00:52:31.159 --> 00:52:34.030
would I bother like supporting building more expensive wind

1037
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.760
turbines which is a problem because we need to,

1038
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.919
we need to still build wind turbines, we need

1039
00:52:38.929 --> 00:52:41.080
both of those things even if we do successfully

1040
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.360
deploy geoengineering. And so this is called uh a

1041
00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.550
moral hazard. Um WHERE deploying geoengineering will leave everybody

1042
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.320
worse off because they won't support climate change mitigation.

1043
00:52:52.199 --> 00:52:57.500
We find limited, no evidence that everyday people actually

1044
00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:00.139
engage in that moral hazard. And this is echoed

1045
00:53:00.149 --> 00:53:02.320
by a ton of survey research, a ton of

1046
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:06.280
other experiments showing that people still support climate change

1047
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:10.040
mitigation even when geoengineering is brought up. In fact,

1048
00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.870
sometimes they want mitigation even more because they think

1049
00:53:13.879 --> 00:53:16.250
the idea of spraying aerosols in the air to

1050
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.120
reflect sunlight is terrifying and horrible. And so they

1051
00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:21.000
say I will build as many wind turbines if

1052
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:22.850
you want me to build, if you promise not

1053
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.169
to do that. But from the leader side, we

1054
00:53:26.179 --> 00:53:30.419
find that people anticipate others will engage in a

1055
00:53:30.429 --> 00:53:33.949
moral hazard. And so they propose policies that are

1056
00:53:33.959 --> 00:53:38.010
less effective because they underestimate the sophistication of their

1057
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:40.850
peers. And so we get this sort of backfiring

1058
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.189
effect and this is largely what we're interested in

1059
00:53:44.199 --> 00:53:46.610
is this interface between the public and the elite

1060
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.939
when it comes to designing and getting support for

1061
00:53:48.949 --> 00:53:50.530
effective mitigation policy.

1062
00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.649
So this has a lot to do with trust,

1063
00:53:54.659 --> 00:53:58.899
right? I mean, to what extent, particularly common people

1064
00:53:58.909 --> 00:54:03.840
can trust their leaders to really communicate a good

1065
00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:08.939
and valuable information and really do what they say

1066
00:54:08.949 --> 00:54:11.860
they're going to do or achieve the results. They

1067
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:18.070
say they want to achieve. Right. Mhm. Uh Do

1068
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.560
you have anything to add to that? Doctor Dalton

1069
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:21.030
or?

1070
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.110
Yeah, I let me just add one more thing

1071
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.879
on the, the question of trust. Um We focus

1072
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.560
specifically on institutions and how institutions constraining leaders can

1073
00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:34.389
generate trust. So I trust a leader not to

1074
00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:37.419
behave in a corrupt way because they're operating within

1075
00:54:37.429 --> 00:54:39.479
an institution that doesn't let them behave in a

1076
00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:41.959
corrupt way. I think this is one of the

1077
00:54:41.969 --> 00:54:45.669
points where taking the insights outside of the lab

1078
00:54:45.679 --> 00:54:48.639
is going to be especially critical because unfortunately, we

1079
00:54:48.649 --> 00:54:52.550
know in other political science research that we tend

1080
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.790
to trust messages from political elites who we already

1081
00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.889
trusted. And so Democrats like, aren't listening to Republican

1082
00:55:00.899 --> 00:55:05.070
senators telling them about disaster prevention. Republicans aren't listening

1083
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.840
to the New York Times when it's telling them

1084
00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.469
about disaster prevention. And so this is a place

1085
00:55:09.479 --> 00:55:11.570
where I'm excited to see more of the marrying

1086
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:15.320
between these sort of incentivized games and the political

1087
00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.729
complexity, especially in the United States.

1088
00:55:19.229 --> 00:55:23.780
So um another way by which people have used

1089
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:27.639
disaster games is to study inequality. I mean, I

1090
00:55:27.649 --> 00:55:31.580
we've already mentioned the issue of inequality as it

1091
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.500
applies to climate change as well because of course,

1092
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:40.195
people from different backgrounds, different countries, poorer regions more

1093
00:55:40.205 --> 00:55:44.544
vulnerable will suffer more from climate change than we

1094
00:55:44.554 --> 00:55:47.975
in the more developed countries, for example. So what

1095
00:55:47.985 --> 00:55:53.034
can we learn about inequality through disaster games?

1096
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.860
Yeah, so we we've run the disaster game and

1097
00:55:56.870 --> 00:56:00.620
others have used the disaster game to add inequality.

1098
00:56:00.629 --> 00:56:03.639
So there can be inequality in the risks that

1099
00:56:03.649 --> 00:56:06.239
people face. How likely is it the disaster will

1100
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:08.540
strike or how much is disaster going to take

1101
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:12.100
from you? There can also be inequality in the

1102
00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:14.979
resources people have to fight climate change. And so

1103
00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:17.330
maybe some individuals are given more of an endowment,

1104
00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.340
some of them are given less of an endowment.

1105
00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:22.959
Unfortunately, we find inequality is one of the biggest

1106
00:56:22.969 --> 00:56:26.159
impediments to getting people to coordinate around successful climate

1107
00:56:26.169 --> 00:56:29.820
change medication. So when there's inequality in the risks

1108
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:33.080
people face or in the resources people have to

1109
00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.679
fight climate change mitigation, it still tends to work

1110
00:56:35.689 --> 00:56:39.219
out pretty well. The problem is when there's inequality

1111
00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:42.250
in both, when some people face very high risk

1112
00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.620
and those people have the fewest resources to fight

1113
00:56:44.629 --> 00:56:47.939
climate change is where we see depressed levels of

1114
00:56:47.949 --> 00:56:52.320
success. Um And unfortunately, that's probably the situation that

1115
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:56.620
closest mirrors what's happening in the real world. However,

1116
00:56:56.629 --> 00:57:00.040
even in these situations where we see the worst

1117
00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:04.270
outcomes, they're still pretty good. We almost never observe

1118
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.379
a situation. We never observe a situation where more

1119
00:57:07.389 --> 00:57:10.699
than a handful of people refuse to contribute anything.

1120
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.790
And so even though there's decreased cooper operation with

1121
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.050
this extreme inequality, there are still very high levels

1122
00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.030
of co-operation in what tends to help are clearly

1123
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.879
defining people's responsibilities, is making sure that people are

1124
00:57:23.889 --> 00:57:27.850
contributing according to their resources or according to their

1125
00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:31.820
risk and coordinating around who is responsible for addressing

1126
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:35.010
this problem can really alleviate those problems of inequality.

1127
00:57:36.729 --> 00:57:39.729
Great. So uh let me just ask you both

1128
00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:43.709
one final general question. So we've talked about he

1129
00:57:43.719 --> 00:57:47.469
here about how we can apply disaster games and

1130
00:57:47.479 --> 00:57:51.810
probably also other kinds of games to understand uh

1131
00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:56.870
people's psychology that is particularly relevant to how we

1132
00:57:56.879 --> 00:58:01.050
can tackle climate change. And we've talked about uh

1133
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:05.449
helping other groups of people, for example, how the

1134
00:58:05.459 --> 00:58:09.610
tension between leaders and their citizens and other topics

1135
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.129
here. Uh Looking at all of these studies and

1136
00:58:14.139 --> 00:58:17.560
results that you and other people got. I mean,

1137
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:22.770
are you optimistic about tackling climate change or not?

1138
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:25.870
Yeah, I think um I think our, our book

1139
00:58:25.879 --> 00:58:28.479
is pretty optimistic. We and we are pretty optimistic

1140
00:58:28.489 --> 00:58:30.580
people about it. Um You know, if we to

1141
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.590
summarize very, you know, very quickly, the kind of

1142
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.469
like what we found, we find, uh people are

1143
00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:39.389
delighted seemingly to not only work together for, to,

1144
00:58:39.399 --> 00:58:41.550
to help themselves as a group, but to help

1145
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.989
complete strangers. Um THAT if you design things, the

1146
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.804
correct way, leaders and citizens don't need to be

1147
00:58:47.814 --> 00:58:50.554
at odds, they can trust each other and often

1148
00:58:50.564 --> 00:58:54.854
they want to work together effectively. Um And that

1149
00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:57.905
uh people are pretty good at making these kinds

1150
00:58:57.915 --> 00:58:59.625
of many of these kinds of decisions, at least

1151
00:58:59.635 --> 00:59:01.534
the ones we discovered. So like the stuff about

1152
00:59:01.544 --> 00:59:04.364
balancing risk and reward. People are great at that.

1153
00:59:04.584 --> 00:59:07.334
Uh In the closing chapter of our book, um

1154
00:59:07.629 --> 00:59:09.399
we, we kind of, we summarize this and we

1155
00:59:09.409 --> 00:59:11.489
kind of outline what we see as the big

1156
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.110
challenge going forward, which is that given that people

1157
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.209
seem really cooper really intelligent about this stuff. We

1158
00:59:18.219 --> 00:59:20.330
think that the bigger the big issue going forward

1159
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.639
is uh that scientists who actually so not us,

1160
00:59:23.649 --> 00:59:26.389
we're behavioral scientists, but scientists who study the climate

1161
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.189
and people who are technologists, you know, they, they

1162
00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:32.649
and with the help of behavioral scientists, we need

1163
00:59:32.659 --> 00:59:35.780
to convince citizens that we actually do understand these

1164
00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:40.500
problems accurately. And the solutions being proposed are reasonable

1165
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:44.100
and appropriate solutions to those problems. Once citizens buy

1166
00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:46.850
in to those things, the problem is so is

1167
00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.620
described correctly and the solutions are described correctly, our

1168
00:59:50.639 --> 00:59:52.959
game suggests then they're, they're happy to do the

1169
00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:56.060
right thing. Um 11 interesting thing about our, our

1170
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.429
games is that, you know, we, we directly give

1171
00:59:58.439 --> 01:00:00.870
you the rules, we give you the stakes and

1172
01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:04.070
people believe us. So we have people leaving uh

1173
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.429
open ended comments at the end of our experiments

1174
01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:09.320
and people who uh you know, scream that climate

1175
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:13.235
change, complete hoax. Um THEY play just like everybody

1176
01:00:13.245 --> 01:00:16.205
else, right? So uh they, they once they buy

1177
01:00:16.215 --> 01:00:18.254
in and they know these are the rules, these

1178
01:00:18.264 --> 01:00:20.735
are the stakes, it doesn't matter what their, their

1179
01:00:20.745 --> 01:00:22.895
beliefs about the Real World were so in the

1180
01:00:22.905 --> 01:00:25.094
real world then, um We think that's one of

1181
01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:27.905
the most important um, elements that is creating this

1182
01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.594
buy in and in, in the public. Um So,

1183
01:00:30.604 --> 01:00:32.715
you know, you know, gaining the trust of the

1184
01:00:32.725 --> 01:00:35.264
public as far as the scientific facts about the

1185
01:00:35.274 --> 01:00:35.754
problem.

1186
01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.699
Uh Would you have anything to add to that?

1187
01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:41.620
Doctor Andrews or?

1188
01:00:41.649 --> 01:00:44.169
Yeah, just that I agree with Andy, we have

1189
01:00:44.179 --> 01:00:48.239
a lot of reasons to be very optimistic. Um

1190
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.260
Which is maybe not what you would assume, thinking

1191
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:54.050
about studying climate change and climate disaster. Um And

1192
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.439
the question is, how do we get people to

1193
01:00:56.449 --> 01:01:00.110
believe in these rules of the game that climate

1194
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.709
change is a problem that it is caused by

1195
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.820
our emitting carbon dioxide to get people coordinating around

1196
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:06.520
this issue?

1197
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.189
Great. So the book is again Climate Games experiments

1198
01:01:12.199 --> 01:01:17.050
on how people prevent disaster. Uh I'm leaving of

1199
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.350
course, a link to it in the description box

1200
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.850
down below. And uh doctors Dalton and Andrews, would

1201
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.179
you like just to tell the audience where they

1202
01:01:26.189 --> 01:01:29.060
can find you and your work on the internet?

1203
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.179
Sure. Yeah. Uh If you uh type in Andrew

1204
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.310
dalton.com, that'll take you to my web page or

1205
01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.750
you can go to uh to Twitter or X

1206
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.469
at at Andy Dalton uh that also eventually lead

1207
01:01:42.479 --> 01:01:43.959
you to my web page and there's links for

1208
01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:46.199
the book, like I said, it's free to download.

1209
01:01:46.209 --> 01:01:48.419
If you go to University of Michigan Press website.

1210
01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.989
Um So, oh, and also I would just as

1211
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.159
a plug, the book is written so that you

1212
01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:56.429
are able to pick and choose what chapters you

1213
01:01:56.439 --> 01:01:58.129
want to read, depending on what topic. So if

1214
01:01:58.139 --> 01:02:00.300
one of the topics we talked about is really

1215
01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.159
interesting, interesting to you and you don't care about

1216
01:02:02.169 --> 01:02:04.709
anything else that's fine. The book is designed to

1217
01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:06.330
be modular in that way. So just, you know,

1218
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.020
feel free to download and just read what you're

1219
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.760
interested in

1220
01:02:10.469 --> 01:02:13.739
and Doctor Andrews, where can people find you on

1221
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.239
being through that?

1222
01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:19.629
Yeah, my website is Talbot dash. Andrews.com. So you

1223
01:02:19.639 --> 01:02:21.790
can see a lot more of my ongoing work

1224
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.669
there. Um You can also find me on X

1225
01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:28.350
and on blue Sky. Thankfully, there aren't that many

1226
01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.350
talbots out there. So I'm pretty easy to track

1227
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.330
down on both of those sites. Um And just

1228
01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.699
to add to Andy's plug about our book, it's

1229
01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:38.929
free to download. Uh It has a pretty clear

1230
01:02:38.939 --> 01:02:42.300
crash course in why use behavioral economics at all.

1231
01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.649
So even if you're teaching something related to climate

1232
01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:48.770
change, but about econ games, we have what I

1233
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.639
think is a pretty nice introduction to that method

1234
01:02:51.649 --> 01:02:52.370
as well.

1235
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.750
Great. So I'm leaving links to all of that

1236
01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.540
uh in the description of the interview and thank

1237
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.669
