00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.759
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.320
the Center. I'm your host, as always Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.029
And today I'm joined by Dr Samuel Viser. He's

4
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.800
a clinician researcher at Raps that is the reso

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.965
and uh a Su Polaris Aion social, former, formerly

6
00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:24.885
assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at mcgill

7
00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:29.454
University. He is an anthropologist and psychosocial clinician working

8
00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:32.845
at the intersection of Psychiatry, Cognitive Science and the

9
00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:38.029
Social Sciences. And today we're focusing on topics like

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.090
uh internet and sociality, smartphone, addiction, culture, and mental

11
00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:48.310
health, placebos, and the free energy approach to human

12
00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.479
cognition and culture. So doctor via, welcome to the

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.169
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.810
Thank you so much. It's a great pleasure to

15
00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:57.270
be here.

16
00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.750
So I I would like to start with your

17
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.709
work on the internet and its impact on cognition,

18
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.750
well being social relations and so on. And so

19
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.110
could you start by telling us a little bit

20
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.190
about what you studied there exactly in terms of

21
00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:19.750
the psychosocial impact that the internet has?

22
00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.860
Yeah. Well, at first I was very interested in,

23
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.959
in what happens to humanity. Once we transition into

24
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.959
this digital niche, it seemed to me there was

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.779
a broad set of unexamined questions and then I've,

26
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.199
I've changed my mind many times over the years.

27
00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:38.389
I, I do wanna say at this point, having

28
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.629
researched this phenomenon for, for many years, I think

29
00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.220
the internet is an absolute disaster. I think that

30
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.120
human sociality once it's uh happening on the internet

31
00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:52.839
exponentials by far the very worst, the most vile,

32
00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.000
dangerous, violent aspects uh of human nature. But before

33
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.339
we get there, I want to tell you a

34
00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.440
little bit about what I've learned or at least

35
00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:03.860
some questions that I've asked, uh, when studying the

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.279
internet. Um, THE first thing I found fascinating is

37
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.320
that for me, studying human sociality on the internet,

38
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.850
taught me a lot about how sociality and how

39
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.259
the human mind works to begin with. Namely that

40
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.520
the human mind is this wonderful evolved organism that

41
00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.940
is in many way, uh, that in many way

42
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.850
works just like the internet in that it's optimized

43
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.539
to outsource or download fitness relevant information and sometimes

44
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.570
entire cultural packages to a network of other minds

45
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.380
and to a network as well of cumulative cultural

46
00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.550
knowledge that no single human could ever have, uh,

47
00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.059
invented or devised sort of, uh, on her own.

48
00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.750
Um, I've come to realize over the years that,

49
00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.309
uh, when faced with an overabundance of information, a

50
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.699
lot of interesting and worrying things happen. I mean,

51
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.940
at first we might have wondered, uh, we might

52
00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.089
have thought that having access to potentially the entire

53
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.270
memory of humankind, just, you know, uh at the

54
00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.429
touch of a of a thumb scroll would be

55
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.910
a wonderful thing, but it doesn't seem to be

56
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.570
uh what happened. Um So let me, let me

57
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.199
backtrack a little bit and, and tell you a

58
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.639
bit more about the sociality and the human mind

59
00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:20.539
and, and how sort of how they work on

60
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.259
the, on the internet. So, sociality speaking, refers to

61
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.100
the capacity to form joint goals to engage in

62
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.119
shared attentions and to engage in joint action. So

63
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.250
this is not uh unique to humans. There are

64
00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.500
many social species, but humans have an added socio

65
00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.619
cultural, symbolic and also narrative uh di dimension that

66
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.669
I that I mentioned briefly. Um So when, when

67
00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.649
faced with an overabundance of information, we've learned that

68
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.440
the human mind tends to create these bottlenecks for

69
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.630
evolutionarily cheap or evolutionarily salient information. So things that

70
00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.750
are particularly relevant for our fitness, things that the

71
00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.240
human mind creates much more than Big Macs and

72
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.220
in fact, much more than sex. Pardon me a

73
00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:08.229
minute, turn this off. Um So here we're talking

74
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.860
about things like uh threat, uh negativity, uh pornography,

75
00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:18.839
uh tribalism, uh mass herding, social contagion and, and

76
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.720
sort of uh mass hysteria. Um So, unfortunately, we've,

77
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.709
we've learned that this is sort of what happens

78
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.109
to the average human once they're precipitated into this,

79
00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:33.640
this kind of weird disembodied uh digital niche and

80
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.529
the internet in many ways has made us much

81
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.959
more paranoid. Uh It's made us much, much more

82
00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.739
negative. I mean, remember that uh the human mind

83
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.869
is kind of like an overactive smoke detector. We

84
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.260
need to be very attentive to things that pose

85
00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:50.500
a potential threat. We know the fabled stories that

86
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.790
we evolved in conditions that were very different from

87
00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:54.690
the ones in which we live now, a very

88
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.239
very volatile environment environment. So we know that we

89
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.010
tend to be much, much more negative on the

90
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:04.040
internet. Uh We know that uh news with uh

91
00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:08.429
negative content about danger, about social threats, in particular

92
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.250
about uh tribal affiliations tend to generate more clicks,

93
00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.950
uh more shares, more, more time watching um et

94
00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.760
cetera. So to, to again, make a long story

95
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.290
short, I would say that the net total, the

96
00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:26.299
total impact of the internet on humanity, it's probably

97
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:28.399
a net negative. This is not to say that

98
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.959
it has not brought benefits. Uh I sometimes think

99
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.779
of it sort of like a tail land phenomenon

100
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.260
kind of like the distribution curve for IQ. There's

101
00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.579
probably in the in the far right. And uh

102
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.540
a small number of people that has greatly benefited

103
00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:45.170
from having access to so much knowledge. At the

104
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.700
same time, I wanna say with a huge social

105
00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.750
cost, there is a social cost to just kind

106
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.329
of spending time online. Um But my fear is

107
00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.470
that the uh the internet and, and I know

108
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.250
it's hyperbolic but may, may bring us to some

109
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.510
kind of some kind of doom. And we're seeing

110
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:04.029
it right now with the immense social polarization and

111
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.450
radicalization that is happening, the difficulty that people have

112
00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.119
talking to each other the way in which people

113
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.730
have become much more on edge, much more un

114
00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:15.250
nuanced. So yeah, I would say in a nutshell,

115
00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:17.369
this is what I can tell you about the

116
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.579
the internet from an evolutionary perspective.

117
00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.540
Uh But co could you explain a little bit

118
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.369
better how we, you studied the internet and its

119
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.619
impact impacts on human sociality and psychology? I mean,

120
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.839
I I'm asking you that also because I've had

121
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.179
people several different people on the show. And of

122
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.165
course, this is a very broad question and we

123
00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:43.214
would have to perhaps break it down into several

124
00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:46.255
different domains because the internet is a very broad

125
00:06:46.265 --> 00:06:50.904
thing that includes many things like social media, pornography,

126
00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:53.535
video games and so on and so forth. And

127
00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:57.779
uh I've had people on the show, many of

128
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.899
them have been somewhat or, or even very critical

129
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.809
of the literature about the supposed psychological impacts of

130
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.859
some of those things. Of course, like for example,

131
00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:17.140
if it is really produced more political polarization, the

132
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:22.904
supposed i psychological impacts of consuming pornography, uh the

133
00:07:22.915 --> 00:07:25.755
psychological impacts of social media and so on. So,

134
00:07:25.765 --> 00:07:28.535
uh I mean, before we get into uh perhaps

135
00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:31.214
some of those criticisms, tell us a little bit

136
00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:35.695
more about how you approach this, how you studied

137
00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:35.894
it.

138
00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:42.720
Uh Yeah, so perhaps on a the internet tends

139
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.640
to exponentially and exacerbate a lot of aspects of

140
00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:48.920
human nature and a lot of our most basic

141
00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:52.500
needs, most of which are social uh in different

142
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.630
ways and most of which are related to social

143
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.779
fitness in, in, in different ways. Um So, so

144
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.700
certainly the literature on the impact of the internet

145
00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.309
on mental health, for example, is at this point

146
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.260
inconclusive and it is controversial. Some studies, for example,

147
00:08:07.269 --> 00:08:10.100
claim to find a causal effect between say time

148
00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:12.559
spent online or time spent on social media and

149
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.190
poor mental health and others don't. It may be

150
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.839
that there's a confound because there is different kinds

151
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.500
of construct and measures. So not studies, not all

152
00:08:20.614 --> 00:08:22.904
these are looking at the same at the same

153
00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:26.454
thing. Uh WE know as a matter of uh

154
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:31.625
association and and and correlation that generation z sometimes

155
00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:34.804
called uh Igen. So I'm thinking of the works

156
00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:38.135
of Jean 20 her more current work with Jonathan

157
00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:41.775
Hyde, for example. So the generation born after 1994

158
00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:46.650
the generation primarily socialized online generation that uh had

159
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.750
much less face to face contact uh appears to

160
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.409
be much more polarized. Uh And and it for

161
00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:57.190
sure, suffers from uh much, much more frequent mental

162
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:03.500
health problems, especially depression, anxiety, personality disorders, uh self-harm

163
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.590
body identity disorders of all kinds. So, so it

164
00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:08.760
is correct that the the causal link has not

165
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.780
been clearly established. Uh For many of us, it

166
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:13.729
sort of flies in the face, it it's kind

167
00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:16.989
of obvious. So you mentioned different dimension. Uh You

168
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.590
mentioned social media, you mentioned uh pornography. Um WELL,

169
00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:25.409
social media tends to fulfill the very basic narcissistic

170
00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.640
human need. And I use the term narcissism in

171
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.869
the more psychodynamic psychoanalytic sense, not as a pathology,

172
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.705
but as a need to be seen, it needs

173
00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:36.825
to be validated. This is this is completely normal.

174
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.025
So, on the one hand, there are very individualistic

175
00:09:39.034 --> 00:09:42.195
societies uh have these strange injunctions saying that, you

176
00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:43.684
know, you should just be who you are and

177
00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:45.405
and not care what other people think. But of

178
00:09:45.414 --> 00:09:49.445
course, uh we care most deeply uh about being

179
00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:53.325
seen, about being validated. Um It's much, much more

180
00:09:53.335 --> 00:09:56.934
stressful once we're projected into this, this bottomless, you

181
00:09:56.945 --> 00:10:01.179
know, Agora of uh uh of again, just the

182
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.729
weight of the gaze on on young bodies is

183
00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:07.960
extraordinary, extraordinarily stressful. So you take all the the

184
00:10:07.969 --> 00:10:10.570
the the kinds of uh you know, the the

185
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.210
micro drama of everyday life of socialization of, of

186
00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:16.849
wanting to be popular, for example. Well, that's a

187
00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:20.000
lot more stressful on the internet uh being intimidated,

188
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.919
being ignored, for example, that that's much more popular,

189
00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:25.919
but it's much more stressful on the internet. So

190
00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:29.900
things like, like social credit scores have always existed

191
00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:33.179
on an implicit level, humans are always scanning the

192
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.200
social world for models of whom they should emulate,

193
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.270
uh who their allies are, who their enemies are.

194
00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:41.440
And, and we do it much, much more, we

195
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.869
do it faster. We do it much more potently

196
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.559
on the internet. So there's this, this again, kind

197
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:51.049
of exponential. Uh THE impact of pornography is, is,

198
00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:55.369
is also quite controversial. Although several researchers and journalists

199
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.349
have noticed what has sometimes been called a sex

200
00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:01.690
recession. It appears as though uh generation Z also

201
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.880
has less sex than previous generations. They have less

202
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.729
long lasting relationships. Uh They're also, and I think

203
00:11:08.739 --> 00:11:12.380
we'll get there later. They, they've considerably uh shuffled

204
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.400
and reinvented what it means to be gendered, what

205
00:11:14.409 --> 00:11:16.000
it means to be human, what it means to

206
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.599
be, to be sexual. Uh The overall result appearing

207
00:11:19.609 --> 00:11:22.960
to be some kind of confusion. Um When it

208
00:11:22.969 --> 00:11:24.929
comes to pornography, it could be that young men

209
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.750
in particular form very unrealistic expectations of what relationships

210
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.919
are like and that's not being matched in the

211
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.960
uh in what the real or the real world

212
00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:39.340
uh sort of give them. Um But my own

213
00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.419
concern as, as a researcher and a clinician is,

214
00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:45.489
is uh on, on, on two dimensions. One being

215
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.940
political polarization is this mass hurting this kind of

216
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.099
tribalism, the extreme difficulty that people, younger people in

217
00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:57.500
particular appear to have uh talking across ideological divide,

218
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:02.000
uh divides or, or different value systems. Um And

219
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.950
also on, on, on mental health um in a

220
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.280
moment, we'll probably talk a bit about, about addiction

221
00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:08.909
as well. But I can tell you something that

222
00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:12.679
child psychiatrist, child and adolescent psychiatrists see the world

223
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.979
over is uh as young Children who are sent

224
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.119
young, younger and younger Children who are sent to

225
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.659
the emergency room because when their parents try to

226
00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:23.559
take away their tablets, they have an absolute meltdown.

227
00:12:23.989 --> 00:12:26.969
Uh There's also things like the spread of uh

228
00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:31.630
different kinds of potentially factitious mental health disorders. Uh

229
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.690
SELF harm has shown to be very contagious on

230
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.640
social media. Uh I could go on and on

231
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.710
with just horrific examples of, of what happens to

232
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.770
people and young people in particular once they're socialized

233
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.929
online in this disembodied space.

234
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.369
O OK. So as I said, several different things

235
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.000
that, that we could get into here, you mentioned,

236
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.039
for example, there at the end is self harm

237
00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:00.679
and I would imagine you would be talking about

238
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.070
some of those, for example, challenges that sometimes we

239
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.190
see on the news that spread across, for example,

240
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.349
tiktok youtube and other kinds of social media. But

241
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:16.239
I mean, when it comes to that specifically, the

242
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.280
kind of way we tend to talk about it,

243
00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:22.690
isn't it a little bit overblown? I mean, isn't

244
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.520
it the case that the number of actual victims

245
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.880
of those kinds of things is very little or,

246
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.799
or am I wrong?

247
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.960
Yeah. So I would say if we're talking about

248
00:13:35.969 --> 00:13:39.679
the fear that young people will be uh groomed

249
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.549
or recruited by a, you know, network of statistic

250
00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:45.440
individuals. I mean, that's thankfully quite rare and that's

251
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.219
overblown. Uh THE kinds of challenges that are not

252
00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:51.510
so much viral on tiktok, but that are viral

253
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.119
in stories about those alleged challenges. I would say

254
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.979
those are, are greatly overblown blown. I'm concerned with

255
00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:02.510
a much more initially, mundane and normal. Again, narcissistic

256
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.679
human need to be seen. Something that interests me

257
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.520
greatly about the human species is that uh you

258
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.539
know, I tend to think of it as a

259
00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.359
kind of a fragility trade off. So, so about

260
00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:15.260
2 million years ago or so, and then the

261
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.549
homo erectus lineage, we started, we developed cooper breeding,

262
00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.479
collective child rearing. We started caring for the weak

263
00:14:22.489 --> 00:14:24.979
caring, the stick. This was really the strength of

264
00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.239
our species. So we traded off individualism and physical

265
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.840
strength for this kind of vulnerability. And from there

266
00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:35.719
evolved two key human competencies, the ability to understand

267
00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:39.010
other people's needs and the ability to signal our

268
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.359
suffering. So as to receive help, I sometimes think

269
00:14:42.369 --> 00:14:44.320
there might be something of a of a the

270
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.440
risk of a if not fully a spare, a

271
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.450
kind of a a maladaptive risk in that it's

272
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.049
often quite advantageous socially to suffer. Uh If you

273
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.520
think of sibling rivalry, for example, often uh siblings

274
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.590
are competing for the weakest status. Uh SO as

275
00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:04.309
to receive parental care and parental attention. So we've

276
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.950
also, we've also seen a lot of this, you

277
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.640
know, so called culture of victimhood of or of

278
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.090
culture of suffering, you know, online uh particularly for

279
00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:16.059
generation Z. Uh This is again, not new. And

280
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.669
we know that comparing the cross cultural and historical

281
00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:22.219
record, some cultures, some religions have elevated suffering is

282
00:15:22.229 --> 00:15:24.520
an end in itself more than others. So again,

283
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.820
it seems to me there's a sort of universal

284
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.520
human risk. Um So going back to what we

285
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.530
see in, in the clinical context, we see a

286
00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.890
lot of young people who uh you know, who

287
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.270
go through the difficulties of growing up and who

288
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.809
want to find networks of peers who want social

289
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.440
support and, and, and who share stories about how

290
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.030
they're unwell. And it's on that level that we

291
00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:49.239
have seen um perhaps not full fledged epidemic, but

292
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.580
uh but but a tendency to exacerbate and to

293
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.890
copy behaviors like cutting, for example, or emphasizing, you

294
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.989
know, the, the I was gonna say the desire

295
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.140
to, to have a mental health condition. So we're

296
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.299
seeing a lot of this kind of sharing and

297
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:06.330
these organic modes of sociality among young people that

298
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.500
are articulated among suffering, sometimes relating in, in harm.

299
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.150
And, and there are really terrible stories that I'm

300
00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:16.070
hesitant to talk that I'm hesitant to talk about

301
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.909
online because I don't want to create more sort

302
00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:20.729
of contagion. But young people can go very far

303
00:16:20.739 --> 00:16:23.450
in seeking attention and, and seeking this sort of

304
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.210
validation and in uh incrementally. But at some point

305
00:16:28.219 --> 00:16:31.479
exponentially raising the bar are of the kinds of

306
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:34.609
distress that they will display online so as to

307
00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:37.479
receive care, attention, validation, et cetera.

308
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.099
Mhm. So I I want to get into addiction

309
00:16:41.109 --> 00:16:44.239
in a second but ju just before that going

310
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.070
back for a second to what I mentioned earlier,

311
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.960
particularly related to mental health. And and you mentioned

312
00:16:52.969 --> 00:16:56.530
there, for example, the work by Jinwan Jonathan, he

313
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.320
and others trying to link the use of social

314
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.219
media to certain mental health issues like depression, anxiety

315
00:17:05.229 --> 00:17:07.839
and so on in Gen Z and so on.

316
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.760
Um I I mean, since uh a and, and

317
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.670
you mentioned that there uh since that sort of

318
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:23.430
link is very disputed, uh is that something that

319
00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:28.479
you uh draw from, is that something that worries

320
00:17:28.489 --> 00:17:31.650
you a lot? Because I I mean, again, looking

321
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.380
at the studies and literature reviews, meta analysis and

322
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.479
so on, the results seem to be always the

323
00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:43.869
same, it is either inconclusive or the results come

324
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.390
up the other way that is that the internet

325
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.300
instead of having negative psychological effects actually has positive

326
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.420
psychological effects. If, if the results come negative, usually

327
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.770
the effects tend to be tend to seem very

328
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.359
tiny. So I mean, is that something that at

329
00:18:02.369 --> 00:18:07.589
least at this point we should uh care a

330
00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:11.479
lot about since the basically the evidence is I

331
00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:12.949
guess inconclusive,

332
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.500
right? Yeah, I think we ought to care about

333
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.079
that and we ought to conduct uh more meticulous

334
00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:25.819
and more ecologically um valid studies. Um I would

335
00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:28.260
like to hope that if we had a large

336
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.979
epidemiological surveys uh with uh uh a broader, a

337
00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:38.180
battery of a very kind of broad psychosocial functioning

338
00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:40.800
tests. Uh YOU know, the, the kinds of tests

339
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.569
that the, the, the P A framework for well

340
00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:46.199
being in schools that the OECD uses. It seems

341
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.609
to me that we would have much richer data

342
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:51.729
and we, we might be able to establish perhaps

343
00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:56.489
uh perhaps more, more causal effects. Um II, I

344
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.810
remain a fan and I hope it's not an

345
00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:01.449
ideological bias of mine. II, I want to say

346
00:19:01.459 --> 00:19:03.430
the data shows me otherwise, I will, I will

347
00:19:03.439 --> 00:19:06.780
change my mind uh As a parenthesis II, I

348
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.969
also agree with the claim that in, in, in

349
00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:12.150
some cases. Uh So that's, that doesn't mean just

350
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.550
for some humans, but it means in some aspects

351
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.130
of our lives, the internet has a positive psychological

352
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.839
effects. It is the source of socialization, it is

353
00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:22.739
a source of, of meaning. It is, it is

354
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.709
a source of pleasure. There is no question. Um

355
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.619
But I was gonna say I'm, I'm I'm a

356
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.239
fan of the kinds of hypotheses put forth by

357
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.680
again, Jonathan, he and 20 via their parallel interest

358
00:19:34.689 --> 00:19:38.229
in helicopter parenting. Uh So, from that perspective, which

359
00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:41.709
is also an evolutionary or an evo devo evolutionary

360
00:19:41.719 --> 00:19:46.150
developmental perspective, uh a young organism needs to sample

361
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.489
a broad enough range of statistical regularities in the

362
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.920
world, including a broad enough range of potential threats.

363
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.560
So as to learn, to optimize its system, so

364
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:58.619
as to learn to navigate the complexity and the

365
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.599
unpredictability of the world around them, I think that

366
00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:04.699
once people are, are deprived of that, once they're

367
00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:07.040
in their bedroom, once they're behind a screen, most

368
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.839
of the time, there's a very strange kind of

369
00:20:09.849 --> 00:20:12.390
mismatch and gap that happens where they can be

370
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.349
very theoretically and intellectually knowledgeable about a whole range

371
00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:19.719
of things. Uh They're not able to apply in,

372
00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:21.959
in real life. So this, this may also be

373
00:20:21.969 --> 00:20:24.849
one and this, this may also explain why once

374
00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:27.979
people who are primarily socialized online, leave the bedroom

375
00:20:27.989 --> 00:20:31.380
and enter even, you know, uh relatively safe space

376
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.290
like a university classroom, they get constantly triggered because

377
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.739
the world is sending them information that does not

378
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.170
match their expectations. And this creates that well with

379
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.040
the psychology we call anxiety or uh or, or

380
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.579
stress. Um So, so that may also be a

381
00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:49.810
kind of a secondary effect of the internet. You

382
00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:52.390
know, not so much the internet itself causes these

383
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.420
mental health difficulties, but the fact that people just

384
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.589
move and grow up in very different ways. And

385
00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:00.400
there's so many quote unquote normal things that they're

386
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.270
not experiencing anymore. Mhm.

387
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.150
So let's get into addiction now because we've done

388
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.859
some work specifically on smartphone addiction. So, uh fir

389
00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:16.670
first of all, how do you understand addiction in

390
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.829
this context? What does it mean exactly? Uh HOW

391
00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:22.609
does it manifest?

392
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.050
Yeah. So I have a very pragmatic uh completely

393
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.280
Amoral, nonjudgmental perspective on, on addiction. Addiction is, is

394
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.630
anything that, that you do is too much anything

395
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.780
that will interfere with your everyday life and cause

396
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.160
uh impaired functioning uh in everyday life. Uh So

397
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.420
the the the studies on smartphone addiction that we've

398
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.199
conducted use a scale called problematic smartphone use uh

399
00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:54.449
that looks at the impact of uh of phones

400
00:21:54.459 --> 00:21:56.719
in a variety of aspects of everyday life from,

401
00:21:56.729 --> 00:21:59.579
from sleep and, and neck pain to what interests

402
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:01.844
me the most sort of social relations. So for

403
00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:04.844
example, uh you may really love being on your

404
00:22:04.854 --> 00:22:08.354
smartphone. Uh But if other people tell you uh

405
00:22:08.364 --> 00:22:10.604
frequently comment that you spend too much time on

406
00:22:10.614 --> 00:22:13.045
your phone. If you missed opportunities, if you have

407
00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:15.824
conflicts at home or at work, then we may

408
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.005
say that there's a problem.

409
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:22.050
Mhm But, but uh is do we know if

410
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.680
that's a widespread issue? I mean, are there many

411
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:30.949
people particularly, I guess in this case, younger people

412
00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:34.000
suffering from smartphone addiction?

413
00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:40.739
Yeah, we've conducted, we've conducted several studies including international

414
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.390
surveys and meta analysis of existing studies. Um The

415
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.739
first effect that we found years ago when we

416
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.800
were just trying to find different kinds of psychological

417
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.550
correlates of smartphone addiction. That was an early kind

418
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.439
of funky study that we did trying to see

419
00:22:55.449 --> 00:23:00.589
if smartphone addiction correlated with hypnotisable. So we hypnotized

420
00:23:00.599 --> 00:23:04.189
something like 600 university students in Montreal. We found

421
00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:07.160
a a weak correlation. But we also found that

422
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.920
the the the the rates of smartphone addictions among

423
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.589
young university students were very, very high. This is

424
00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:17.630
something that we found in subsequent studies. Uh SURVEYING

425
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.829
in our latest one has I believe something like

426
00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:23.239
95 countries and it's almost always the same effect.

427
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.520
So younger people are much more addicted. Uh This

428
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.949
is also based on screen time measures. So they

429
00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:31.500
spend much more time on their phone but also

430
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.130
females uh are are much more addicted. So then

431
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.530
there are some country level differences that are very

432
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.579
interesting. We see that on average East Asia, Southeast

433
00:23:40.589 --> 00:23:43.630
Asia, the Middle East people are more addicted than

434
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.969
in Europe, North America is somewhere in the middle.

435
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.250
And we also find that countries with a high

436
00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.420
cultural tightness. So tightness, looseness is a, is a

437
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.209
kind of a cultural measure that describes uh the

438
00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:58.969
extent to which people abide by strict social norms

439
00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:02.160
or not. So people in culturally tight countries uh

440
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.599
appear to spend more time on their phone and

441
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.959
be and be more prone to smartphone addiction.

442
00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:12.209
And since we're focusing mostly on sociality here, what

443
00:24:12.219 --> 00:24:17.420
are some of the effects that smartphone addiction has

444
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.150
on sociality specifically?

445
00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:26.560
Well, as I said earlier, I think it exacerbates

446
00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:31.290
and exponentials. Some of the riskiest aspects of sociality,

447
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.209
uh in particular, the group is the, the tribalism

448
00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:36.930
and, and the kind of hurting. And this is

449
00:24:36.939 --> 00:24:38.770
a very old question as you know, in, in

450
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.890
evolutionary anthropology, I mean, the the uh going back

451
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.290
to even Dunbar's number and the average number of

452
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.890
people that the uh average cognitive mind can, can

453
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.219
kind of handle. But we, but we know from

454
00:24:50.229 --> 00:24:53.319
various sources of evidence and various disciplines that humans

455
00:24:53.329 --> 00:24:56.349
are through and through very very tribal. We have

456
00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:59.599
this intrinsic need to identify our allies uh but

457
00:24:59.609 --> 00:25:03.119
also to identify our enemies. So it's interesting to

458
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.000
see that uh sociality on the internet has of

459
00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.930
course, on some level extended the range and the

460
00:25:08.939 --> 00:25:12.699
scope, certainly the geography of solidarity, but it has

461
00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:15.625
created much more social competition and it has created

462
00:25:15.635 --> 00:25:18.845
much more uh social divides and and, and we've

463
00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:22.485
seen again, I want to say uh with the,

464
00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:25.015
the conceptual tools that are available to us at

465
00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:27.046
this point, we have not established a clear causal

466
00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:30.245
link. Uh But we know that uh since the

467
00:25:30.255 --> 00:25:33.135
advent of the internet, we appear to have become

468
00:25:33.145 --> 00:25:36.416
much more politically polarized. Uh MORE so in some

469
00:25:36.426 --> 00:25:39.276
countries than others, it could be that say the

470
00:25:39.286 --> 00:25:42.926
kind of polarization that started peaking in North America

471
00:25:42.936 --> 00:25:46.322
around 2016 with the Trump election appears to have

472
00:25:46.332 --> 00:25:49.891
become contagious as well. So, so people have started

473
00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:51.732
polarizing in Europe and in the rest of the

474
00:25:51.741 --> 00:25:56.001
world around similar kind of cultural lines arguing about

475
00:25:56.011 --> 00:26:00.842
similar kinds of uh of sacred values. Um And,

476
00:26:00.852 --> 00:26:03.281
and I want to emphasize again, those mechanisms of

477
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:05.702
social contagion that I alluded to earlier when I

478
00:26:05.712 --> 00:26:07.722
talked about the the spread of harm and that

479
00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:11.842
the spread of illness uh copying kinds of phenomena.

480
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.239
So, so I would say that overall, in my

481
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.949
view, based on what I've seen so far, uh

482
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:23.119
polarization has increased and, and probably uh probably mental

483
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.109
illness has increased as a result of internet sociality.

484
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.599
So I would like to get now a little

485
00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:35.000
bit more into mental health specifically. And uh this

486
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.750
is something uh this question is something that I've

487
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.560
already done. Uh SOME interviews on particularly of the

488
00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:45.949
record you mentioned, for example, Doctor Lawrence Kier Mayer

489
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.010
w have on the show and we thought we

490
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.140
did an entire interview on this. But what role

491
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.989
does culture play in mental health?

492
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.390
I would say it plays an enormous part and

493
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.420
to appreciate that we can try to conceptually uh

494
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.760
break down different relevant dimensions of culture or, or

495
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.500
that part of human, that part of humanity that

496
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.069
is socio cultural. Um I, I like to use

497
00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:17.920
a simple biological definition of culture. Um We know

498
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.109
that culture exists when we noticed behavioral differences, which

499
00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:24.819
to the best of our knowledge arise through social

500
00:27:24.829 --> 00:27:29.380
learning, social cultural learning, as opposed to uh simply

501
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.739
genetics. So whatever is not uh kind of innate.

502
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.750
So the impact of uh of that aspect of

503
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.349
humanity on mental health. Um Well, if we start

504
00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:43.410
with the obvious dimensions of sociality, things like social

505
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.650
support, uh things like relational mobility, which is uh

506
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.569
the freedom that people have in different societies to

507
00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:55.229
interact with uh different people, cultural tightness or looseness,

508
00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:58.050
which I also mentioned uh also the things like

509
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.119
social status, which, which we'll talk a little bit

510
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.390
more about. Um But also all the constructs like

511
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.410
cultural consonants, cultural consonance is the extent to which

512
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.150
people feel that they live up uh to culturally

513
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.619
postulated goals. So, so whatever things are elevated as

514
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.670
good and true and important in a culture in

515
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.359
different domains. So what is a good family? Uh

516
00:28:18.369 --> 00:28:21.689
What is a, a good career? Uh What is

517
00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:24.339
a good romantic life like people tend to live

518
00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:27.540
up measure themselves against these kinds of models. So

519
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.530
all these different constructs that I mentioned are known

520
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.500
empirically causally to have an effect, not just on

521
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.250
mental health uh but on, on the health um

522
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.400
social status in particular, which uh as it happens

523
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.160
is quite difficult to define in both social science

524
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.689
and in public health. It's not just income, uh

525
00:28:47.709 --> 00:28:50.280
it's not just cultural capital. So there's sort of

526
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.520
linguistic and symbolic resources you have available, it has

527
00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.489
something to do with the way uh your person

528
00:28:56.709 --> 00:29:00.969
and your group is positively or negatively regarded, the

529
00:29:00.979 --> 00:29:04.160
kind of dignity that is assi that is culturally

530
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.020
assigned to your group in a, in a broader

531
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.680
social ensemble. This has a huge effect on health

532
00:29:09.689 --> 00:29:12.339
and on, on mental health as well. So we

533
00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:15.260
know that loss of status, loss of dignity uh

534
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.130
can cause uh cardiovascular problems. It can cause all

535
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.329
kinds, it can trigger uh chronic illnesses, it can

536
00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:28.550
even um trigger oo other kinds of uh yeah,

537
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.079
illnesses. So, um so those are the more kind

538
00:29:33.089 --> 00:29:36.430
of obvious uh dimensions of uh the socio cultural

539
00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.930
part of the the human species that have uh

540
00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:42.349
a link to mental health. One that I'm particularly

541
00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:44.739
interested in as a as an anthropologist, which I

542
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.410
suspect you might have discussed a bit with Professor

543
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.739
Kammeyer is also the narrative in the symbolic dimension

544
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.920
uh in particular, what anthropologists called idioms of distress.

545
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.189
So idioms of distress are uh culturally postulated ways

546
00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:04.270
to make sense of suffering, uh to explain the

547
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.810
cause of suffering, but also to uh recommend particular

548
00:30:08.819 --> 00:30:12.109
avenues for for cure. So, an idiom of distress

549
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:14.329
is really a kind of a full cultural package

550
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.314
that contains uh an explanation for a particular ailment,

551
00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:23.795
but also that contains expectations for the phenomenological presentation

552
00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:25.905
of how one is supposed to feel once one

553
00:30:25.915 --> 00:30:29.915
is recruited into this narrative model and then particular

554
00:30:29.925 --> 00:30:32.464
cultural scripts for you know, how to get better.

555
00:30:32.729 --> 00:30:36.270
So what's interesting about idioms of distress is that

556
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.800
um they can be partly or holy or not

557
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.790
at all grounded in, in a scientific, you know,

558
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.239
quote unquote real uh comprehension of a phenomenon. So,

559
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.479
in some cultures, uh mental illness or indeed, illness

560
00:30:49.489 --> 00:30:52.319
itself can be explained by uh uh you know,

561
00:30:52.329 --> 00:30:56.430
the the doings of ancestors or spirits. Um IN

562
00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:59.829
our culture, we often invoke things like hormones and

563
00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:04.030
neurotransmitters. Um I'll, I'll note here as an anthropologist

564
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.839
that the level at which the average human mind

565
00:31:06.849 --> 00:31:10.305
comprehends with going on in their body, how they're

566
00:31:10.314 --> 00:31:13.114
supposed to feel. Uh It is the same. Uh

567
00:31:13.125 --> 00:31:17.194
So from ancestors and, and spirits to say, you

568
00:31:17.204 --> 00:31:22.314
know, serotonin or, or testosterone here, we're invoking metaphysical

569
00:31:22.324 --> 00:31:26.045
ideas which very strangely and we'll talk about placebo

570
00:31:26.055 --> 00:31:28.494
in a moment, have a, a kind of pin

571
00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:32.130
log correlate. So again, in some cultures, someone might

572
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.369
start feeling dizzy and they might feel they might

573
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.579
think, OK, this is a wind attack or this

574
00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:38.589
is a spirit attack and I should go get

575
00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:41.250
a holy water treatment and say, uh in other

576
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.150
cultures, people will feel uh a little bit of

577
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.959
a pain in the left side of their arm

578
00:31:45.969 --> 00:31:48.489
and they'll believe, OK, I'm having a heart attack.

579
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.979
Um AND I should call 911 and I should

580
00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:54.729
go to the hospital. Uh But, but both examples

581
00:31:54.739 --> 00:31:59.810
uh describe a, a human being mostly implicitly and

582
00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:02.099
then automatically tapping into a kind of idiom of

583
00:32:02.109 --> 00:32:06.219
distress. So I've become very interested in how uh

584
00:32:06.229 --> 00:32:10.810
these idioms of distress which uh basically encode a

585
00:32:10.819 --> 00:32:16.680
particular valence and phenomenological presentation in, in, in experience

586
00:32:16.709 --> 00:32:20.500
can also be I want, I almost wanna say

587
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.609
causally uh can affect human health and human well

588
00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:28.609
being. Uh So I've also been very interested in,

589
00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:33.060
you know, probably since 2017 or so in what

590
00:32:33.069 --> 00:32:35.250
I call the culture of mental health or mental

591
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.530
health culture. It's very interesting how uh you know,

592
00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.339
5030 maybe even 20 fif 15 years ago by

593
00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:47.050
summer camps, we didn't talk about mental health enough.

594
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.839
Uh There was, there was a stigma about it.

595
00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:51.650
People suffered in silence, but now it seems to

596
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.250
me we talk about mental health all the time.

597
00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:57.890
Uh So, so people now in many ways appear

598
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.540
to understand the tribulations of the ups and downs

599
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:04.869
of everyday life through a, a very interesting psychopathological

600
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.540
lens which through uh what you could call a

601
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.300
nocebo uh negative placebo effect could, could also in

602
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.030
a sense contribute to making people unwell.

603
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.530
Uh Which is very interesting. You mentioned that they

604
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.670
are the, the culture of mental health and I

605
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.869
fought many times that you hear all the time.

606
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.400
People claiming that we don't talk about mental health

607
00:33:29.489 --> 00:33:34.959
enough for about particular, perhaps particular conditions enough. But

608
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:39.469
actually, we're hearing about it all the time nowadays,

609
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.239
at least I'm hearing about it all the time.

610
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:42.479
So,

611
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.349
yeah, I, I it's very strange, I wonder it

612
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.530
may be AAA reflection of something that ought to

613
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.369
be an anthropological law. This is a so called,

614
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.310
you know, Mo Mo Patrick Moynihan's law, uh the

615
00:33:56.319 --> 00:33:58.550
American Senator who said, you know, the, the the

616
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.030
better things get the worse they seem there, there

617
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.000
appears to be a kind of anthropological mechanism there

618
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.500
that ought to be investigated more. Uh

619
00:34:06.949 --> 00:34:11.000
But you mentioned no cables there, for example. So

620
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.750
from an anthropological perspective, that's where you come from

621
00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.510
and also wedding with a clinical perspective, how do

622
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.590
you approach placebos? What is a placebo? Exactly?

623
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.790
Well, uh a better t for placebo and the

624
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.918
one using the literature is non-specific effect or non-specific

625
00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.478
effects. So basically, um any aspect of, of a

626
00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.399
cure or, or I which can be extended to

627
00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:48.870
any uh modulation of unconscious uh bodily resources that

628
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:52.590
cannot be attributed to the intended mechanism of action.

629
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.129
So for example, you devise a particular pill, you

630
00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.260
have a, a theory that a particular molecule may,

631
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.479
may cause something in the body, that thing in

632
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.590
the body does happen, but it's not caused by

633
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.899
that molecule, it's caused by other things. So placebo

634
00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:09.189
effects are very complex and multifaceted this way. Uh

635
00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:11.120
I know in popular culture, we tend to think

636
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:13.300
of them as uh as say a sugar pill

637
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.260
like the ones that are used in many randomized

638
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:20.340
control trial. But again, a placebo is, is any

639
00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:26.860
modulation via an external cue of unconscious bodily resources

640
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.689
resulting in most cases, this is what we want

641
00:35:29.699 --> 00:35:32.020
in a healing response, but it could also be

642
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.770
resulting in in an in an illness response in

643
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.510
anthropological terms. I like to think of um placebos

644
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.850
as a broad ecology of cues, of symbols of,

645
00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.159
of rituals of paraphernalia. Uh BUT also of, of

646
00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:54.590
specific encounters and of different psychological and psychosocial dimensions

647
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.709
that contribute to the cure. Uh And, and here,

648
00:35:57.719 --> 00:36:00.500
I'm nodding to the works of uh Irving Kirch

649
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:05.159
from the placebo program at Harvard. Um So, I

650
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:07.030
mean, I could, I could list list of a

651
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.100
few of those. Um We know for example, very

652
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:15.879
interestingly that the the more elaborate uh a placebo

653
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:20.719
device or, or uh placebo ecology, usually the more

654
00:36:20.729 --> 00:36:24.280
effective the response. So for example, uh taking four

655
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.919
pills, four times a day, placebo placebo pills works

656
00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:31.280
better than one pill. Swallowing. Uh A big gel

657
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.919
cap that is difficult to swallow tends to work

658
00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:37.560
better than just a simple sugar pill. Placebo injections

659
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.870
work even better. And then uh the absolute El

660
00:36:40.879 --> 00:36:44.360
Dorado here, something really invasive like a placebo surgery

661
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.919
will work even better. So it seems there's also

662
00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:49.969
a motivational dimension to this. The the more the

663
00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:53.310
more costly, the more people have to personally sacrifice

664
00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.350
to personally invest in the cure, the better it

665
00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.620
works. Um We know that the uh particular dynamics

666
00:37:02.629 --> 00:37:05.709
and the affect dynamics of the clinical encounter, which

667
00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:07.590
as an anthropologist, I like to think of as

668
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.270
a shamanic encounter are very, very important. So in,

669
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.149
in all cultures, there are uh individuals who undergo

670
00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:20.830
long initiations and eventually come to be, become masters

671
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.219
of a very esoteric language. Uh Going back to

672
00:37:24.229 --> 00:37:27.649
idioms of distress. It's, it's most often language about

673
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.729
invisible particles uh that regulate the cosmos. So things

674
00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:36.310
like spirits, ancestors, uh but also neurotransmitters um and,

675
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.649
and hormones. Um THESE are people who usually wear

676
00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:42.429
very specific kinds of costumes. These are people that

677
00:37:42.439 --> 00:37:46.959
you encounter in very difficult to access uh places.

678
00:37:46.969 --> 00:37:48.850
So it could be like a cave at top

679
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.780
like this mythical cold mountain or it could be

680
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.199
uh it could be um an appointment at a

681
00:37:55.209 --> 00:37:58.439
Neurological hospital after a six months waiting list, knowing

682
00:37:58.449 --> 00:38:01.110
that the person is, is an expert. So this

683
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.969
this idea of epistemic expertise, the epistemic authority, someone

684
00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:09.239
who is a recipient and expert uh in this

685
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:13.320
very esoteric knowledge is very important. The status, again,

686
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.199
the epistemic status assigned to the healer or, or,

687
00:38:16.209 --> 00:38:19.520
or to the shaman, but also the, the, the

688
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.260
warmth um the, the hope that is conveyed, uh

689
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.959
the verbal suggestions that are delivered uh during a

690
00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:29.879
particular clinical encounter are very important. So when, when

691
00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:32.270
uh when a patient is, is led to believe

692
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.479
that he or she will get better. Uh AND

693
00:38:35.489 --> 00:38:37.649
particularly once all the cues are in place or

694
00:38:37.659 --> 00:38:41.820
recall, uh the the motivation, the difficulty to access,

695
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.820
the, the trust and and expertise, the paraphernalia, the

696
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.340
costumes. So we know that things like what, at

697
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.379
least in the West white blouses and, and stethoscopes.

698
00:38:50.389 --> 00:38:53.439
When someone looks uh like a doctor, these things

699
00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:55.979
tend to work uh very, very well. So I

700
00:38:55.989 --> 00:38:57.409
could go on and on. But I think I've

701
00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:59.840
outlined, you know, a few of the symbolic, you

702
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.330
know, ritual and interactive dimensions of, of these placebo

703
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.110
effects.

704
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.050
And there's also this notion of a super placebo.

705
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.139
What is it?

706
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.149
So a super placebo is something that uh a

707
00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:18.050
few researchers and I and others and in other

708
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.959
labs have tried to toy around with which is

709
00:39:20.969 --> 00:39:25.669
trying to stack up and experimentally manipulate as many

710
00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:30.199
of the ritual, symbolic and psychosocial and technological dimensions

711
00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:33.750
of placebos. So as to create a super placebo

712
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.850
procedure, one in which um the placebo response is

713
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.129
so strong that it may lead to very spectacular

714
00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:42.030
kinds of healing.

715
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.149
And so I, I mean, how do you look

716
00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:52.889
at placebos from a therapeutic perspective? Because uh I,

717
00:39:52.899 --> 00:39:57.570
I guess that we could say they are doing

718
00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:02.889
something, right? I mean, because sometimes I'm saying this

719
00:40:02.899 --> 00:40:08.100
because many times people tend to dismiss certain effects.

720
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.090
So we it's just a placebo effect but it's

721
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.729
still in effect,

722
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:18.209
right? Yeah, to me, the notion that something is

723
00:40:18.219 --> 00:40:22.370
just a placebo effect is, is, is ludicrous. However,

724
00:40:22.379 --> 00:40:25.610
the the the question of placebo therapeutics raises all

725
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.350
kinds of very complex uh first epistemic and then

726
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.179
ethical questions. So, so again, remember that a placebo

727
00:40:34.189 --> 00:40:37.739
is just whatever way to bypass or short circuit

728
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.570
conscious mechanisms. So as to tap into parts of

729
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.020
say, bodily responses that are not typically consciously accessible,

730
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.949
things like autonomic resources uh or, or, or healing

731
00:40:48.959 --> 00:40:54.729
uh responses. Um It's a complicated question because I

732
00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:56.840
want to say that at the time that I

733
00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.020
was working on hypnosis, which is another way to

734
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.360
tap into these unconscious resources and placebo effects. I

735
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.860
might have been a little bit more naive than

736
00:41:06.159 --> 00:41:09.500
uh where I am now given that I've uh

737
00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:12.260
I've taken a lot of clinical training and, and

738
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:13.949
I, I've been working in a clinical and a

739
00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:17.939
psychotherapeutic context uh for, for about four years now.

740
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.479
So I'm a little bit more skeptical about this

741
00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:23.300
kind of uh you know, quick fixes and, and

742
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.149
this idea that you can, you know, instantly remove

743
00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:29.320
a problem with a, with a quick uh intervention.

744
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.239
However, there is no question that, that wonderful, almost

745
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.469
miraculous things can be achieved with uh with a

746
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:41.870
placebo uh therapeutic, the medical profession and the medical

747
00:41:41.879 --> 00:41:45.889
funding, the medical research funding bodies uh by and

748
00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:49.090
large have been very reluctant to fund this kind

749
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.979
of research, probably because it raises difficult ethical questions

750
00:41:52.989 --> 00:41:56.669
about the role of deception in healing, for example,

751
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.419
um If we lie to someone, what are the

752
00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:02.419
possible consequences? Pragmatically, it could be, well, if they

753
00:42:02.429 --> 00:42:04.729
find out that it was all a sham, so

754
00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:08.425
to speak, um are they gonna stop? Uh ARE,

755
00:42:08.435 --> 00:42:10.534
are they gonna get worse? Are the symptoms gonna

756
00:42:10.544 --> 00:42:13.044
return? Uh IS there a risk that people might

757
00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:17.534
lose trust in the institution of medicine, thereby actually

758
00:42:17.544 --> 00:42:21.014
losing access to another placebo dimension. Uh THAT I

759
00:42:21.024 --> 00:42:24.364
mentioned earlier because that's another point about placebo research

760
00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:28.385
is that any intervention, any clinical encounter contains a

761
00:42:28.395 --> 00:42:31.834
placebo dimension. So I hope uh was that those

762
00:42:31.844 --> 00:42:34.979
could be harnessed, those could be used, but it

763
00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:38.060
very well may, may, may be uh if we

764
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.669
lay aside the worry about deception for a while

765
00:42:40.679 --> 00:42:43.949
that uh particularly when it comes to mental health

766
00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:47.129
conditions, there are things that simply take a long

767
00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:52.350
time to work on. Um So uh when you

768
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.219
look at the difficulties of a quote unquote mental

769
00:42:56.229 --> 00:42:58.729
order, a lot of the time people have built

770
00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:03.080
say defense mechanisms uh that help them function that

771
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.000
help them sustain uh the difficulties of life in

772
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.500
some sense, but that also cause impairments in other

773
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:11.290
aspects of their lives. Uh I think what most

774
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.899
psychotherapists and most mental health clinicians would tell you

775
00:43:13.909 --> 00:43:17.149
is that if you remove a defense too quickly,

776
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.159
the person is often not equipped to function. So

777
00:43:20.169 --> 00:43:22.669
you gotta go much, much slower. Uh You know,

778
00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:24.310
if we had time, you know, we could, we

779
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.959
could talk about the current hype in in psychedelic

780
00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:30.199
psychiatry, for example, which many of us think, you

781
00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:33.040
know, carries that danger. It's, it's a little bit

782
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:37.520
too quick. Uh A fix um psychedelics, by the

783
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.320
way, this is, this is relevant to the current

784
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:44.189
conversation um to our best understanding, they are a

785
00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:49.929
kind of super placebo enhancer uh psychedelics greatly exponentially

786
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.719
and greatly augment sensitivity to contextual cues. So they

787
00:43:54.729 --> 00:43:58.300
make all the placebo dimensions of a clinical encounter

788
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:01.229
much more potent, which is why um as a

789
00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:03.939
as a super tool, psychedelics have to be used

790
00:44:03.949 --> 00:44:06.949
very, very cautiously like the, the the context and

791
00:44:06.959 --> 00:44:10.979
the ethical context has to be um conceptualized very,

792
00:44:10.989 --> 00:44:14.280
very cautiously. So in a nutshell, some of the

793
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.820
difficult questions around placebo therapeutics. Mhm

794
00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.489
And also uh the there's this idea of neuro

795
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.919
placebos that has to do with the fact uh

796
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:30.570
with or with how people react to neuro imaging.

797
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.810
Could you tell us about

798
00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:38.620
that? Yeah, I think simply uh neuro culture uh

799
00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:43.020
neuro enchantment, my former mentor, Miraz calls it has

800
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.560
a lot of currency in our culture. Uh It

801
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.050
is an explanatory model that has very, very high

802
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:52.100
epistemic authority uh because of frequency of exposure uh

803
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.330
because of the very high epistemic status assigned to

804
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.590
everything neuro. So it's very interesting to me as

805
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.260
an anthropologist to see the way in which people

806
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.540
and young people routinely invoke the idea of the

807
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.100
brain as an agency other than the self. So

808
00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.360
we often hear seven or eight year olds tell

809
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.610
you, oh, I have a DH D my frontal

810
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.340
lobes uh won't let me concentrate. And here in

811
00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.879
the back of my mind, I'm thinking, well, yeah,

812
00:45:16.889 --> 00:45:20.459
they're invoking the ancestors or, or the spirits. So

813
00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:23.340
all this to say that um we talk about

814
00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.260
neuro everything. At this point, we have, you know,

815
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:30.250
new nutrition, neurop politics and neuro education. Uh YEAH,

816
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.459
neurotechnology is, is very elaborate. It has this salience,

817
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:37.469
it has this this epistemic currency. So we know

818
00:45:37.479 --> 00:45:40.449
that uh for rhetoric, for example, if you want

819
00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:42.219
to make a particular argument, if you're able to

820
00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:46.129
have just brain uh brain imaging pictures, people will

821
00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:50.639
be convinced uh more, more easily. Uh So for

822
00:45:50.649 --> 00:45:53.520
me, yeah, neurop Placebo is just a way to,

823
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:57.310
to tap into this this neuro culture as a

824
00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.520
placebo intervention. And we, we, we've done a bit

825
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.500
of that experimentally in the lab and, and we

826
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.300
had very surprising results. Um So we used, for

827
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.459
example, building on, on the works of my former

828
00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:09.870
mentor, Amir Raaz and his graduate students who are

829
00:46:09.879 --> 00:46:13.215
doing different technologies, they, they were curious about the

830
00:46:13.225 --> 00:46:15.524
extent to which people can be convinced first that

831
00:46:15.534 --> 00:46:17.574
a machine could read their mind. So in, in,

832
00:46:17.584 --> 00:46:20.324
in the first installment, way back in 2014, they

833
00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:23.314
had a very crudely built a brain machine that

834
00:46:23.324 --> 00:46:25.425
was not even explained in terms of the functioning

835
00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:29.415
that was built from uh I believe a hairdresser's

836
00:46:29.425 --> 00:46:33.215
uh hairdresser's helmet. And then with the uh the

837
00:46:33.225 --> 00:46:36.564
help of the magic trick, uh people could very

838
00:46:36.574 --> 00:46:39.969
easily be convinced that this brain machine could read

839
00:46:39.979 --> 00:46:41.969
their thoughts, could, could guess what number they were

840
00:46:41.979 --> 00:46:49.340
thinking of in subsequent experiments, um students and, and

841
00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.459
researchers in the ra lab wanted to know if

842
00:46:51.469 --> 00:46:54.709
people's behavior could be influenced by tapping into this

843
00:46:54.719 --> 00:46:57.159
kind of neuro enchantment. And they also found that

844
00:46:57.169 --> 00:46:59.260
they were through the use of the magic trick,

845
00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.770
able to insert thoughts into people's minds. But at

846
00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.949
the time, participants reported very interesting things, several of

847
00:47:06.959 --> 00:47:11.209
whom reported uh feeling uh dizziness or, or tingling

848
00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:14.469
or particular or, or a very dull headache. And

849
00:47:14.479 --> 00:47:16.389
we began to wonder at the time if we

850
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:18.929
could tap into that a little further. Um So

851
00:47:18.939 --> 00:47:21.939
we started using uh a much more elaborate mock

852
00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:25.229
scanner uh that was used mock MRI scanner, uh

853
00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:27.510
that was used for people with, with phobias to

854
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.429
train, going to the machine. And later, we got

855
00:47:29.439 --> 00:47:32.580
to use a real although the defunct MRI at

856
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.409
a neurological hospital and we piloted a study with

857
00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:40.449
Children with uh neurodevelopmental disorders and behavioral difficulties, uh

858
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:45.870
giving them specific suggestions uh about their symptoms, uh

859
00:47:45.879 --> 00:47:48.419
encouraging them to believe that they would get better

860
00:47:48.439 --> 00:47:50.989
and we found very strong results uh at the

861
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.570
time. Uh So that's, that's an example of a

862
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.489
of a super placebo intervention. We, we had uh

863
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.000
you know, we had a, we had a waiting

864
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:01.280
list. Uh We had people coming to this difficult

865
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.520
to get to Neurological hospital. We had this very

866
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:08.229
elaborate technology. Uh We had a warm pseudo clinicians

867
00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:12.159
delivering very positive suggestions tailored to the child difficulties

868
00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:14.739
and to the child's strength and, and we had

869
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.229
very promising results at the time. I say at

870
00:48:17.239 --> 00:48:19.739
the time because, and here I'm going back to

871
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.520
potential pitfalls of these place placebo interventions. We're not

872
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.340
sure about how long those typically last. You, you

873
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:30.260
can create a very uh very hopeful, very euphoric

874
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:33.010
response once people are, are hooked to the novelty

875
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.070
of an intervention. Um BUT very few studies have

876
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.500
tracked in the long term, the longitudinal positive effects

877
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.949
of placebo interventions.

878
00:48:41.479 --> 00:48:46.379
Mhm So getting to, I guess the last part

879
00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:50.459
of our interview, going back to human cognition and

880
00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:52.340
culture and some of the things we're going to

881
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:56.459
talk about here, you've probably already mentioned or touched

882
00:48:56.469 --> 00:48:58.300
on when I asked you about the role that

883
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.389
culture plays in mental health. But tell us a

884
00:49:01.399 --> 00:49:06.000
little bit about the free energy approach to human

885
00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.179
cognition and culture. What is this approach about? How

886
00:49:10.189 --> 00:49:10.840
does it work?

887
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.100
Yeah. So the, the free energy or the v

888
00:49:16.439 --> 00:49:21.320
the variational free energy approach is, is a relatively

889
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:26.030
new uh mathematical formulation of something that I wanna

890
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.979
say has been known uh for a long time

891
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:33.439
uh in different cultures and different philosophically philosophical traditions.

892
00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:37.800
Um NAMELY that um reality is some kind of

893
00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.780
illusion or projection or that what we see is

894
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.449
really kind of what we expect. So the free

895
00:49:44.459 --> 00:49:48.250
energy principle is, is borrowed from physics. Um And

896
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.919
it's really Professor K Fris and at Imperial College

897
00:49:51.929 --> 00:49:55.129
London, a psychiatrist in Europe uh scientists who pioneered

898
00:49:55.139 --> 00:49:58.060
these approaches. And we were fortunate with Lawrence Kammeyer,

899
00:49:58.439 --> 00:50:02.540
others uh to, to work on uh with Professor

900
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.520
Kristen on a free energy formulation of the co

901
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.750
evolution of cognition and culture that we will talk

902
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.600
about uh in, in a culture. So the free

903
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.469
energy principle describes the way in which organisms strive

904
00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:19.310
to maintain themselves in a state of self-organization by

905
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.520
resisting entropic decay. So I I I'll cut the

906
00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:26.939
long story short here because physicists and mathematicians uh

907
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.699
sometimes are unhappy with the way in which we,

908
00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:31.989
we use the term entropy, we use the term

909
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.040
entropy here in information theoretic terms about the amount

910
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:40.580
of possibilities uh that are possibilities that are available

911
00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.479
to uh specific organism in any, in any different

912
00:50:44.489 --> 00:50:48.489
system. So the idea is that uh hu life

913
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.939
as a whole attempts to resist entropy by maintaining

914
00:50:51.949 --> 00:50:56.610
itself by making itself consistent. But minimizing free energy

915
00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.689
here means free energy. Uh FOR living things refers

916
00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:03.550
to the average gap or the mismatch between what

917
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.969
an organism expects and what it gets what external

918
00:51:06.979 --> 00:51:10.770
states of the world uh afford if you will.

919
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:14.469
So these expectations are primarily based on evolved dispositions,

920
00:51:14.479 --> 00:51:18.409
but then behavior will be uh evolved dispositions plus

921
00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:22.810
or minus constraints in the environment. Uh A, a

922
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.780
kind of a parallel sister approach to uh the

923
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.489
free energy principle is the predictive processing paradigm in

924
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.169
cognitive science, which which I I know you're, you're

925
00:51:32.179 --> 00:51:35.889
knowledgeable about uh which is again, this idea that

926
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.780
uh individual organisms uh scan statistical regularities in the

927
00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:44.020
world around them and what they get in the

928
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.459
world. So as to predict optimized behavior, to deal

929
00:51:47.469 --> 00:51:53.129
with particular uh fitness, relevant solutions, what we try

930
00:51:53.139 --> 00:51:56.620
to do with the uh cultural affordances and thinking

931
00:51:56.629 --> 00:51:59.110
throughout the mind's model is apply this to human

932
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.649
cognition. First of all, and to apply this to

933
00:52:02.659 --> 00:52:05.000
uh to the the evolution of culture and to

934
00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.570
the cultural part of, of human beings, the free

935
00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.199
energy principle and predictive processing describes the behavior of

936
00:52:12.209 --> 00:52:16.479
individual brains quite well. But what we felt was

937
00:52:16.489 --> 00:52:19.320
missing was this. And I want to call it

938
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.310
this internet dimension, this kind of uh this network

939
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.550
of all their minds. One of our hypotheses, which

940
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.389
I want to say still needs to be verified

941
00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:31.560
empirically through uh different methods is that the the

942
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.830
domains of statistical regularities in the world that are

943
00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.840
most important to humans. So as to be able

944
00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:42.280
to create models, internal models uh to function and

945
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:45.350
to survive is of their minds. So this is

946
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.800
what we call the thinking throughout the mind framework.

947
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:50.260
For this kind of uh in mathematical terms that

948
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.709
the mark of blankets, the statistical buffer between an

949
00:52:53.719 --> 00:52:58.189
individual's uh expectations and the world around them. Humans

950
00:52:58.199 --> 00:53:02.610
outsource these solutions to all the minds, to caregivers

951
00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.419
to their group. Um But it's interesting to think

952
00:53:07.429 --> 00:53:12.820
of uh things like institutions like and technologies like

953
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:18.780
uh language, uh kinship, uh politics as anti anthropic

954
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.699
as entropy minimizing kinds of mechanisms. So of late,

955
00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:27.919
I've also become interested in uh political polarization as

956
00:53:27.929 --> 00:53:31.719
you know, but of political polarization as a kind

957
00:53:31.729 --> 00:53:35.010
of uh entropy minimization. It's very interesting to note,

958
00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.959
for example, how uh whenever there's a rapid disruption

959
00:53:39.179 --> 00:53:41.830
in a socio cultural ecology, so this could be

960
00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.050
a pandemic, it could be a natural disaster. Uh

961
00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.709
But very sadly, for democracies, it could be also

962
00:53:47.719 --> 00:53:53.889
be when uh people's what psychotherapist called assumptive worlds.

963
00:53:53.899 --> 00:53:57.560
So the totality of expectations um about what people

964
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.739
hold to be true and good in the world.

965
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.199
Whenever that changes too quickly, people, people tend to

966
00:54:03.209 --> 00:54:06.030
kind of retract uh to a more say a

967
00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.080
more kind of conservative position. So an influx of

968
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:12.290
mass immigration, for example, will typically cause a rise

969
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.040
in populism or a tightening of social norms or

970
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.449
tightening of values for uh for certain uh at

971
00:54:19.459 --> 00:54:21.659
least for certain groups who feel like they don't

972
00:54:21.669 --> 00:54:24.090
recognize the world around them because it has become

973
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.610
too entropic because uh it has become too complex.

974
00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:34.169
A and so uh but uh how do cognition

975
00:54:34.179 --> 00:54:39.169
and culture interrelate? Because if I understand it correctly,

976
00:54:39.179 --> 00:54:45.110
the free energy principle applies first to cognition and

977
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.929
then you move from cognition to culture. Is that

978
00:54:48.939 --> 00:54:49.370
correct?

979
00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:57.770
Right. Although talking of cognition and culture for humans

980
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.719
is almost a pleonasm I want to say because

981
00:55:00.729 --> 00:55:05.449
human cognition is in my view, first and foremost,

982
00:55:05.459 --> 00:55:09.770
optimized for cultural learning. So for collective learning, uh

983
00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.469
we know that the, the, the minimal cognitive ingredient

984
00:55:13.479 --> 00:55:17.370
for sociality is a theory of mind or the

985
00:55:17.379 --> 00:55:20.370
the ability to understand others mental states, the ability

986
00:55:20.379 --> 00:55:24.610
to understand others perspective, uh joint intentionality uh is

987
00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.010
a, is another synonym for that. We know that

988
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.229
a lot of uh our energy budget, a lot

989
00:55:31.239 --> 00:55:34.590
of our cognitive budget goes to social scenarios and

990
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.790
goes to social learning. It's very interesting when you

991
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:42.639
look at things like um different cognitive styles um

992
00:55:42.689 --> 00:55:46.250
like the the autistic spectrum. For example, people who

993
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.584
are uh hyper denial and high on the autistic

994
00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:53.145
spectrum have these savant abilities. Simply as a question

995
00:55:53.155 --> 00:55:56.334
of uh energy allocation. It seems that they're spending

996
00:55:56.344 --> 00:55:59.625
much less on social, much less cognitive budget on

997
00:55:59.635 --> 00:56:02.215
the social scenarios which occupies just so much of

998
00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:05.264
our mental space I say are for most neurotypical

999
00:56:05.274 --> 00:56:08.915
which confers them the savant like abilities uh in,

1000
00:56:08.925 --> 00:56:12.915
in in other domains. Um But again, human cognition

1001
00:56:12.925 --> 00:56:16.635
is is already optimized for culture and for cultural

1002
00:56:16.645 --> 00:56:17.024
learning.

1003
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.800
Mhm So it's not possible to strictly separate human

1004
00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:27.520
cognition for culture or to talk about culture or

1005
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:30.780
to talk about cognition. Sorry, that is independent from

1006
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:33.689
the culture, right?

1007
00:56:35.649 --> 00:56:38.149
I I it's difficult to know, for example, the

1008
00:56:38.159 --> 00:56:43.030
extent to which uh infant cognition is already inculturated.

1009
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.590
For sure. There is a process of developmental scaffolding

1010
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.709
uh whereby as as behavior becomes culturally patterned and,

1011
00:56:51.719 --> 00:56:55.370
and, and reinforced, it becomes more linguistically enriched, it

1012
00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:58.500
becomes more uh symbolically enriched. So it's as though

1013
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:01.360
uh over the course of ontogeny, over the course

1014
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:05.179
of the development, we go from a a relative

1015
00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:10.750
relatively individual modes of cognition to increasingly uh more

1016
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.870
social and collective kinds of, of cognition. But uh

1017
00:57:14.879 --> 00:57:18.300
when we look at the kinds of behavioral differences

1018
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.889
in in infant behavior, at the level of feeding,

1019
00:57:20.899 --> 00:57:23.110
at the level of fussiness, at the level of

1020
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.590
attachment styles that exist, you know, much before language

1021
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.850
acquisition, we know that cultural happening is is already

1022
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.870
happening in under the hood, implicitly uh at a

1023
00:57:33.879 --> 00:57:35.419
very, very early age.

1024
00:57:36.229 --> 00:57:42.280
Mhm OK. So let's get into two very specific

1025
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:46.169
aspects of human culture here. That will probably be

1026
00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:50.139
my last two questions. So how do humans learn

1027
00:57:50.149 --> 00:57:55.199
shared expectations and norms through these framework?

1028
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.929
This is very interesting. We don't know uh we

1029
00:58:00.939 --> 00:58:04.719
know that human learned shared expectations and I would

1030
00:58:04.729 --> 00:58:07.739
say that's already progress in cognitive science in terms

1031
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:12.179
of understanding what happens. So we have a better

1032
00:58:12.189 --> 00:58:15.219
understanding of what happens, but we don't exactly know

1033
00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:18.129
how it happens. Uh If I'm to describe a

1034
00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:20.409
little bit of what happens, well, precisely as you

1035
00:58:20.419 --> 00:58:24.050
said, uh humans uh very early in development, learn

1036
00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:29.709
shared expectations, uh they learn uh situationally appropriate context,

1037
00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:34.699
appropriate responses to different situations that are more and

1038
00:58:34.709 --> 00:58:38.689
more culturally scripted. Uh IF you will. So we

1039
00:58:38.699 --> 00:58:42.419
know that uh young humans are able to outsource

1040
00:58:42.429 --> 00:58:45.590
expectations on uh how to behave and, and, and

1041
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.620
even even how to feel uh on a pre

1042
00:58:48.699 --> 00:58:53.100
linguistic level. So with Professor Ker, Professor Frisson, Professor

1043
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.209
Maxwell Ramstead and others, uh we, we've talked about

1044
00:58:56.219 --> 00:58:59.419
what we call these regimes of attention uh the

1045
00:58:59.429 --> 00:59:03.320
way in which pattern cultural practice uh makes particular

1046
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:06.159
features of the world salient, salient or not. So

1047
00:59:06.169 --> 00:59:09.189
it's interesting to note how from one cultural ensemble

1048
00:59:09.199 --> 00:59:11.860
to the next people pay attention to different features

1049
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:14.250
of the world. And they tend to assign a

1050
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.860
particular the valence to different features of the world.

1051
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:20.229
And then those different cues will trigger different kinds

1052
00:59:20.239 --> 00:59:23.229
of behaviors. So we know that this happens, but

1053
00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:26.360
we don't really know how uh there is in

1054
00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:29.399
cultural learning, the same kind of poverty of stimulus

1055
00:59:29.409 --> 00:59:33.870
problem uh as there is in uh in, in

1056
00:59:33.879 --> 00:59:37.219
language acquisition. So the poverty of stimulus was a

1057
00:59:37.229 --> 00:59:40.449
problem famously posed by Noam Chomsky when he pointed

1058
00:59:40.459 --> 00:59:42.860
out that most people, most humans are not. In

1059
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:45.310
fact, no humans are taught uh the workings of

1060
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.919
grammar and syntax. Um AND, and, and how to

1061
00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:50.379
string units of town together yet they're able to

1062
00:59:50.389 --> 00:59:54.510
infer from relatively little explicit instruction. So when it

1063
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.889
comes to cultural learning, the same problem is observed,

1064
00:59:57.909 --> 01:00:01.050
um young people are very, very quickly able to

1065
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.459
acquire uh values and to obey social norms, to

1066
01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:07.360
obey a lot of implicit social norms. Um I'll

1067
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.209
give you another example from more kind of cultural

1068
01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:13.959
psychiatry, we know that tolerance to pain is, is

1069
01:00:13.969 --> 01:00:17.330
subject to uh wide cross cultural differences. And there's

1070
01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.699
a lot of things that happen. Um It could

1071
01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:23.129
be that, you know, a child intuitively learns uh

1072
01:00:23.139 --> 01:00:26.419
a normative response inside her body by watching how

1073
01:00:26.429 --> 01:00:28.810
her parents react. For example, is this a big

1074
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.520
deal? Is this not, should I cry? What happens

1075
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.500
when I cry when I get picked up? But,

1076
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:35.239
but also what does it mean to get picked

1077
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.520
up? Uh Is it seen as a good thing

1078
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:39.610
or is it seen as a bad thing? Um

1079
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.229
So we know that a person's behavior, a person's

1080
01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:45.639
thoughts, a person's value system, but a person's phenomenology,

1081
01:00:45.699 --> 01:00:48.139
I I is really shaped by culture to an

1082
01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:53.570
extraordinary extent uh without explicit instruction. So again, to

1083
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.090
sum up, um how are these shared expectations learned?

1084
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.020
We don't know

1085
01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:02.510
it, it's interesting that you mentioned Payton there because

1086
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.520
I, if I uh please correct me if I'm

1087
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:09.360
wrong. But I guess that those expectations that we

1088
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.219
develop about pain and how we should react to

1089
01:01:12.229 --> 01:01:15.760
pain and so on actually tend to have real

1090
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:20.334
physiological effects, right? In terms of, for example, liberating

1091
01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:24.975
our pain threshold and how much pain people report

1092
01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:28.975
in several different contexts and perhaps uh uh the

1093
01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:35.215
level of pain that they actually uh phenomenological experience

1094
01:01:36.784 --> 01:01:40.834
for sure, you know, pain is still an intractable

1095
01:01:40.844 --> 01:01:44.564
philosophical and, and anthropological problem it's very difficult to

1096
01:01:44.574 --> 01:01:49.010
measure pain, uh pain at its core begins with

1097
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:53.889
a neurophysiological response to a particular stimulus. Uh AND

1098
01:01:53.899 --> 01:01:56.820
then allocating attentional resources to a part of the

1099
01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:00.110
body. Let's say that needs attention. But in order

1100
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.510
for pain to become something like suffering, uh for

1101
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.760
so suffering to be encoded as an unwanted experience

1102
01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:11.310
assigned with a negative valence that feels bad. So

1103
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.560
the particular physiological event requires a cognitive interpretation which

1104
01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:18.729
we call for humans as a cognitive interpretation is

1105
01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:22.709
culturally framed. So we're already recruiting and importing all

1106
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:26.310
kinds of implicit values and, and idioms of distress.

1107
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.389
But note the ways in which experiences that could

1108
01:02:29.399 --> 01:02:33.169
be considered painful in different micro cultural contexts, like

1109
01:02:33.179 --> 01:02:35.949
say athletics, for example, or even to say particular

1110
01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:39.409
sexual practices uh will be encoded with a positive

1111
01:02:39.419 --> 01:02:43.889
valence and will physio fundament logically um feel good

1112
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.379
or for example, I guess also in certain religious

1113
01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:53.500
rituals like walking on fire where many times uh

1114
01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.409
I mean, for people who don't have those kinds

1115
01:02:56.419 --> 01:02:59.810
of practices, it might seem really weird. But many

1116
01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.159
times people in those kinds of rituals, if they

1117
01:03:04.169 --> 01:03:09.159
are asked after the fact, they don't report any

1118
01:03:09.169 --> 01:03:11.709
pain or very little pain.

1119
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.600
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're, you're nodding

1120
01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:18.419
to the work of my colleague, Dimitri Sigalas. Uh

1121
01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:23.179
Yeah. Yes. Fire walking in extreme rituals. Um Again,

1122
01:03:23.189 --> 01:03:27.020
the the the the the neutral physiological event here

1123
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:30.830
is is arousal. So increased heart rate and increased

1124
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.090
respiration and skin conductivity. But that doesn't tell us

1125
01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.850
anything about cinema logically, but it feels like to

1126
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.350
the people uh outside of their own cognitive interpretation

1127
01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.370
and really outside of, of the whole package of,

1128
01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:46.719
of cultural framing that extends to particular ritual moments.

1129
01:03:46.729 --> 01:03:49.050
It's just fascinating again, the way in which the

1130
01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.100
human physiology responds to cultural contact,

1131
01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:56.750
which is actually very interesting because the physiological response

1132
01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.889
might be very similar to someone who reports pain.

1133
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.810
Uh But it's not just uh the simple fact

1134
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.169
that the no C seor get activated, that the

1135
01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:13.929
person will report experiencing pain actually. Right.

1136
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.280
Yes, that's correct.

1137
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:20.189
Mhm So let's get into one final question again,

1138
01:04:20.199 --> 01:04:24.070
having to do with human culture, how does social

1139
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.209
conformity develop?

1140
01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.709
Well, I think we've already mostly answered that question

1141
01:04:32.719 --> 01:04:34.550
in, in that we have failed to answer the

1142
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.590
question. We just know uh we just know that

1143
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.469
it develops and it develops uh slowly and then

1144
01:04:40.479 --> 01:04:45.669
exponentially uh over the course of development. Uh ADOLESCENCE

1145
01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:50.370
is a time of particular vulnerability to social influences

1146
01:04:50.379 --> 01:04:53.550
in in psychodynamic and psychoanalytic terms. It's also a

1147
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.580
time of kind of separation and individuation. So again,

1148
01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:00.040
rather than tell you how it develops, I could

1149
01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:03.159
describe the ways in which I could tell you

1150
01:05:03.169 --> 01:05:05.580
that it develops in different and interesting ways uh

1151
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.739
over the course of development. So I was, you

1152
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:10.800
know, mentioning adolescence is a moment when uh I

1153
01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:14.689
guess a human organism having acquired, let's say enough

1154
01:05:14.699 --> 01:05:17.270
about the home and family and micro environment uh

1155
01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.770
becomes very open to those meso and micro sources

1156
01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.679
and, and starts experimenting with different kinds of identities.

1157
01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:27.929
Um But I, I very much like the, yeah,

1158
01:05:27.939 --> 01:05:32.810
the psychodynamic formulation of separation individuation with an anthropological

1159
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:37.129
twist uh in that becoming an, becoming an individual

1160
01:05:37.139 --> 01:05:42.439
necessarily requires uh social conformity and necessarily requires becoming

1161
01:05:42.449 --> 01:05:48.159
inculturated into uh another uh sometimes broader uh set

1162
01:05:48.169 --> 01:05:51.955
of social social convention. Um And uh and I

1163
01:05:51.965 --> 01:05:55.354
think we've already described uh with many examples also

1164
01:05:55.364 --> 01:05:58.995
about how far social conformity extends, including to physiological

1165
01:05:59.004 --> 01:06:02.834
responses, including to phenomenology uh to what it feels

1166
01:06:02.844 --> 01:06:05.334
like to be a human in, in a particular

1167
01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:08.395
situation. Um We would like to hope that the

1168
01:06:08.405 --> 01:06:11.915
predictive processing and free energy formulations that we've proposed

1169
01:06:12.179 --> 01:06:16.959
uh help to some extent uh describe the mechanisms

1170
01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:19.120
of conformity. But I want to remain humble and

1171
01:06:19.129 --> 01:06:21.790
say that we just, we just don't exactly know

1172
01:06:21.949 --> 01:06:24.830
uh why and how that works.

1173
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.250
OK. So uh just one quick final question, then

1174
01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.760
do, do you think that uh social conformity and

1175
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:36.530
understanding it would tie in any way to the

1176
01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.350
uh the beginning of our discussion when we talked

1177
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.330
about the effects of the psychological effects of the

1178
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:47.489
internet? And you mentioned things like social contagion.

1179
01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:55.060
Mhm Yeah. Again, the, the internet is underpinned by

1180
01:06:55.070 --> 01:07:00.100
so many paradoxes uh apparent and illusory paradoxes I

1181
01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:03.419
wanna say um because the internet appears to have

1182
01:07:03.429 --> 01:07:08.260
significantly scrambled social conformity and created an explosion of

1183
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.229
new ways of being humans and new ways of

1184
01:07:10.239 --> 01:07:12.729
being gendered and new ways of being young. And

1185
01:07:12.739 --> 01:07:16.552
it has, you know, uh certainly increased the the

1186
01:07:16.562 --> 01:07:19.222
kind of gap between uh say young people and

1187
01:07:19.232 --> 01:07:22.002
older people that just a very quick parallel this

1188
01:07:22.012 --> 01:07:25.492
sort of conservation innovation trade off is I think

1189
01:07:25.502 --> 01:07:28.782
best cashed out under under a free energy formulation.

1190
01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:32.913
But because humans require culture in order to function,

1191
01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:35.242
uh We're faced with a very difficult problem in

1192
01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:37.373
trade off in that we need to be in

1193
01:07:37.383 --> 01:07:39.666
any given moment in history. We need to be

1194
01:07:39.676 --> 01:07:43.456
able to uh keep a set of conserved, tried

1195
01:07:43.466 --> 01:07:46.805
true and tested solutions for surviving, how to raise

1196
01:07:46.815 --> 01:07:49.186
our young and, and how to organize our societies.

1197
01:07:49.256 --> 01:07:51.266
But we also need to be able to innovate,

1198
01:07:51.275 --> 01:07:53.476
we need to be able to remain open to

1199
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.635
novel challenges that arise. It could be because of

1200
01:07:56.645 --> 01:08:00.295
ecological changes because of social changes. And it seems

1201
01:08:00.305 --> 01:08:03.050
as humans, we've not been, we haven't really figured

1202
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.830
out where we sit on that and, and there's

1203
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.449
strong individual differences which I think from a niche

1204
01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:10.229
construction perspective work quite well in, in a society.

1205
01:08:10.239 --> 01:08:12.959
You need innovators and you need more conservative people.

1206
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.930
Um The internet appears to have uh and I

1207
01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:20.419
and I wanna say, appears to have ushered us

1208
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:25.399
towards uh the innovation end of that spectrum, perhaps

1209
01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:28.549
to too far an extent uh you very often

1210
01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.689
hear younger people say, well, why should I trust

1211
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.819
elders? Why should I trust boomers? They don't understand

1212
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.759
how to navigate the world around us. They don't,

1213
01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.359
they don't know how to navigate social media. They

1214
01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.160
don't, they don't know the, the current cultural codes.

1215
01:08:41.578 --> 01:08:43.587
So there appears to be a lot of novelty,

1216
01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:45.858
there appears to be where it appears to have

1217
01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:50.249
been ushered towards an endless road towards innovation. I

1218
01:08:50.258 --> 01:08:53.207
want to say at the cost of of some

1219
01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:55.738
of the try to and tested solution for how

1220
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:57.877
to run our societies. But that's, that's a separate

1221
01:08:57.889 --> 01:09:01.640
problem. And uh the ontological dimensions interest me more

1222
01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:04.620
than the ethical dimensions. Why I say this is

1223
01:09:04.629 --> 01:09:08.669
an illusory problem because necessarily when new ways, new

1224
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.779
innovative ways of being are are organically devised, they

1225
01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:17.279
create a particular kind of social conformity. So conformity

1226
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.500
is now of course, no longer bound to uh

1227
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:25.859
uh spatial boundaries that we can empirically experience ourselves.

1228
01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.258
Uh You know, you can have communities of social

1229
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:33.818
conformity that are spread across the planet. But conformity

1230
01:09:33.828 --> 01:09:36.118
needs to happen in order for people to have

1231
01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:39.858
shared expectation, a common repertoire, a common values. So

1232
01:09:39.868 --> 01:09:41.548
we see a lot of this loosening up and

1233
01:09:41.559 --> 01:09:43.658
tightening up, loosening up and tightening up.

1234
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.709
Great. So, Doctor Visa, let's end on that note

1235
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.390
then and just before we go, would you like

1236
01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.669
to tell people where they can find you and

1237
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.259
your work on the internet?

1238
01:09:58.649 --> 01:10:00.790
Oh, I'm not sure. I'm not that good at

1239
01:10:00.799 --> 01:10:03.279
self promotion. Actually, perhaps you could put a link

1240
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.589
to my website and

1241
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.209
OK, no, no problem. I will put a link

1242
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.750
to your website and also a few other links.

1243
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.509
But yeah, they can, you can look up, I,

1244
01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.000
I used to write for, for psychology today to

1245
01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:22.109
try to offer cultural cognitive evolutionary explanations of what

1246
01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.430
goes on in the world. II, I haven't written

1247
01:10:24.439 --> 01:10:26.350
in, in a few years. I've been taking the

1248
01:10:26.359 --> 01:10:29.310
time to think, you know, uh as I ponder

1249
01:10:29.319 --> 01:10:32.080
my, my reconversion, my reconversion as a therapist and

1250
01:10:32.089 --> 01:10:34.560
move much more towards psychoanalysis. Now, I think at

1251
01:10:34.569 --> 01:10:38.080
this point, uh having gone from anthropology to hardcore

1252
01:10:38.089 --> 01:10:41.399
cognitive science to the clinical world, I find that

1253
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:44.200
uh psycho and psychoanalysis for me at this point

1254
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:47.520
offers just a fascinating window into a much more

1255
01:10:47.529 --> 01:10:50.359
fine grained understanding of the complexities of the human

1256
01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:50.879
mind,

1257
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.799
right? So, thank you so much again for taking
