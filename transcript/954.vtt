00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.739
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.020
joined by Doctor Jonathan Mason. He's a professor of

4
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.270
Philosophy at the University of North Florida, specializing in

5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.479
epistemology. And today we're talking about his book, why

6
00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:20.000
it's OK not to think for yourself. So, Doctor

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.180
Mason, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.760
to everyone.

9
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.639
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to talk

10
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:26.479
with you Ricardo.

11
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.139
So to start off with, let me ask you

12
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.720
this question. Do you have any idea at all

13
00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:37.560
where this idea that is very common? Actually, that

14
00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.639
people should think for themselves comes from?

15
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.930
Uh Well, good question. So, I mean, I know

16
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.709
the a lot of people at least point to

17
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.909
the enlightenment uh as with the idea of not

18
00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.110
taking other people's word for it, but doing the

19
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.310
intellectual work yourself. Um So, I mean, that's one

20
00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.069
place I got, I think uh a big boost.

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.300
But I do think also that even just in

22
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.910
the last five years, uh it's gotten another sort

23
00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:11.410
of like boost and so it's again been on

24
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:14.569
the forefront and obviously in, in headlines and on

25
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.690
social media. Um, BUT I think it's been the

26
00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.970
value of, it's been, again, emphasized, uh, of thinking

27
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.839
for yourself or doing, doing your own research. Um,

28
00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.459
YEAH. So it, it's definitely timely I believe.

29
00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.260
But what does it mean exactly when people say

30
00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:35.069
that you should think for yourself, what do they

31
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.750
mean by that? Because as we'll go through the

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.190
other questions, I guess we'll see that it's perhaps

33
00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:46.540
a weirder idea that people think for themselves or

34
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.290
should think for themselves than it sounds uh when

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.419
you first hear it.

36
00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:53.930
Right. Yeah, I think, I think that's exactly right.

37
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.589
So I think, you know, as a kind of

38
00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.809
vague motto, it sounds very great and easy to

39
00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.489
endorse. Um But then thinking about different ways to

40
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.919
make that more precise or more explicit, some, some

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.610
ways seem great and others seem not so, not

42
00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.970
so great at all. So the way, the way

43
00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.119
I think about it is uh not just, you

44
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.929
know, using your own brain since I think, like,

45
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.979
it's impossible for you to not use your brain

46
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.509
in, in some, in some capacity. If you're even

47
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.169
having beliefs, you're using your brain. Um The way

48
00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.300
I think about it is if you're thinking for

49
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:35.350
yourself, you're acquiring and assessing the evidence on your

50
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
own. So the important contrast for me is between

51
00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:43.070
thinking for yourself and deferring to someone else. So

52
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.350
when you defer to someone else, you believe what

53
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.850
they say on their say. So when you don't

54
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.860
have to see their evidence, you don't have to

55
00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.660
hear about their reasoning because they say so uh

56
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.179
is your reason for belief? That's not thinking for

57
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.619
yourself as I'm, as I uh use the term

58
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.710
uh in the book. So thinking for yourself is

59
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.449
doing the opposite of that. You are looking at

60
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.899
the evidence yourself, you are making your own evaluation

61
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.020
uh of that evidence. So, I mean, 11 question

62
00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.309
that kind of I think was also in, in,

63
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.399
in your question was, well, how often do people

64
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.919
actually do that? And I think not so often

65
00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.309
at all. And so even though I think the

66
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.020
people who champion thinking for yourself are often not

67
00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.250
thinking about it in terms of like going ahead

68
00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.679
and doing all of the all of the evidence

69
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.850
gathering yourself and evaluating it yourself. It's impossible for

70
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.880
us not to be relying quite heavily on others.

71
00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.759
Um And so that's where I think there is

72
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.199
a bit of this disconnect between the motto and

73
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.039
the slogan and, and what it actually looks like

74
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.759
on the ground.

75
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.210
A and we're going to get into why that's

76
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.740
the case later on in our conversation. But since

77
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.750
in my first question, you mentioned the enlightenment and

78
00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.429
since you yourself are a philosopher, do you think

79
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.320
that this is a common idea also among philosophers

80
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.509
themselves that you should think for yourself? And I

81
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.429
guess that perhaps associated with that and we'll come

82
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.770
to this point later. There's also uh perhaps one

83
00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.059
of the reasons why it would be common if

84
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.480
it is common, of course, is that it is

85
00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:23.239
associated with intellectual virtue.

86
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.269
Yes. So, I mean, what, what actually got me

87
00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.899
thinking about the, the project in general was this

88
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.429
open letter that was written by a number of

89
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.970
Ivy League professors to incoming uh university freshmen. This

90
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.679
was maybe back in 2019 or 2018. And their

91
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.359
one piece of advice um for incoming students was

92
00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:49.399
to think for themselves like that. That was if

93
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.720
you take our advice about anything, we want you

94
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.260
to do this, we want you to think for

95
00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:57.570
yourself and you know, something about that seems right

96
00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.709
and a great piece of advice, but something also

97
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.119
didn't feel quite right about that and that's what

98
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.079
kind of like led to the puzzle but related

99
00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.440
to the question more directly. I, I do think

100
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.790
that there's something that we value, especially in uh

101
00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.850
the academic world about thinking for yourself. So like

102
00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:17.529
when uh you know, when I am teaching a

103
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.649
class, I want my students to think for themselves.

104
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.690
I want them to be wrestling with the ideas

105
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.130
and the arguments on their own. I want them

106
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.980
to be, you know, cultivating different skills, intellectual skills

107
00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:32.809
and habits on their own. And they, they couldn't

108
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.190
do that if they were just taking my word

109
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.269
for it. Right. So maybe I don't think it's

110
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.279
unique to philosophy, but especially in philosophy, you don't

111
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.704
come to the philosophy uh class just like hear

112
00:05:43.714 --> 00:05:45.945
the answers from your professor, right? You're like, OK,

113
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:47.595
so just tell me, tell me what the answer

114
00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:49.065
to all these questions are. And now I know

115
00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:51.975
the answer, it's more about the the process, right?

116
00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.704
Being able to engage with the reasons, think about

117
00:05:54.714 --> 00:05:58.899
objections, think about ways to answer those objections. And

118
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.170
so that is, um that is thinking for yourself

119
00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.750
and that's an important part. I think of uh

120
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.640
academic life. One kind of question then is how

121
00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.989
much does that translate to your life more generally?

122
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.910
Right? So the question is, is, is there something

123
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.420
special going on um in school when you're learning

124
00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:18.760
versus when you're going about living, living your life?

125
00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:20.170
And that's where I would think that there, I

126
00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.910
do think there's a, there's an important difference, you're

127
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.339
doing something special. Um WHEN you're in school, it's

128
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.829
important for you to be thinking for yourself, something's

129
00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.809
gone wrong with your academic life if you don't

130
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.630
think for yourself. Um But once you're not in

131
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.959
that, uh you're not in that phase of your

132
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.179
life, I do think it's perfectly fine. I mean,

133
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.529
that's the theme of the book. It's OK not

134
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.470
to be thinking for yourself in those cases.

135
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.190
And so with all of that in mind, what

136
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.609
is social epistemology and how can we move from

137
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:53.109
a view of epistemology? That is more based on

138
00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:58.470
the individual one that is more based on society,

139
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.500
on the collective and so on.

140
00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:05.320
Yeah. Good. So there's been a push in epistemology

141
00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.359
the last maybe 20 years towards a more social

142
00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:13.609
picture of epistemology. And I think like, traditionally there's

143
00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.940
at least a way to think about epistemology as

144
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.339
a very individualistic um project. Um So, I mean,

145
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.910
I think of like Descartes um project uh in

146
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.859
his cogito and he's thinking by himself using his

147
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:33.380
own thoughts. Uh And he's making his inquiry all

148
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.890
by himself trying to figure out what he can

149
00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:38.339
be certain of what he can doubt. And there

150
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.730
was no need for, for help from other people.

151
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.779
Um Not that there's anything wrong with that, but

152
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.399
I think that's a, that's a picture that's kind

153
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.690
of unlike how we typically go about figuring things

154
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.309
out and inquiring um in the world. So social,

155
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.160
social epistemology tries to take that, that picture of

156
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.500
how we are dependent on others and how we

157
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.269
rely on other people more seriously in our, in

158
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:06.829
into epistemology, right? So it, it's thinking about how

159
00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:10.040
the beliefs of others are relevant to our beliefs

160
00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:12.739
and the rationality of our beliefs. It's thinking about

161
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.820
the roles that institutions play in generating knowledge and

162
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:22.070
preserving knowledge, dis, disseminating knowledge. And so those are,

163
00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:25.630
those are both moves beyond the individual, right? So

164
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.440
it's not just about a particular individuals, evidence and

165
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.630
ideas and beliefs, it's the broader picture about how

166
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.690
they fit together with other people, with institutions. Uh

167
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.349
Yeah,

168
00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.148
and there's this idea, I mean, I've talked about

169
00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:46.429
this with, for example, Hugo Mercier, four years ago

170
00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:49.619
when he released this book Not Born Yesterday, because

171
00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.869
we have this very common idea that people in

172
00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:57.979
general are stupid or are gullible. And so there's

173
00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:00.869
also this very common idea associated with that with

174
00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:04.989
that is the madness of crowds. But actually, now

175
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.809
we also have the reverse in psychology. And I

176
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.460
guess that uh in your book, you would also

177
00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:15.349
explore that idea that is the wisdom of crowds

178
00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:21.599
that is people in collectives usually risen better than

179
00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:25.010
alone. And many times, I mean, if you ask,

180
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.150
if you pose the same question to lots of

181
00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:34.609
people, statistically, you would tend to the right answer,

182
00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:35.599
right.

183
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.479
Yeah. So, I mean, I think two, both parts

184
00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:42.390
there I think are important to uh the book

185
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.539
product. The first is, you know, uh maybe I

186
00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:47.909
don't wanna say everyone's, everyone's an idiot or what

187
00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.719
you said. But I do think an important part

188
00:09:49.729 --> 00:09:51.940
is, you know, for almost anything you want to

189
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.789
think about, there's other people that are better at

190
00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.919
thinking about that than you are, right? So there's,

191
00:09:56.929 --> 00:10:00.619
there's very few things where you are like the,

192
00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:03.599
the, the the expert or the leading expert on

193
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:05.900
the, on, on the topic. And so there is

194
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:09.119
this great resource that we have intellectual resource of

195
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.840
other people who ha who are more informed than

196
00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:13.919
we are more intelligent than we are, have thought

197
00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:15.900
about it longer than we have. And so that's,

198
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:18.739
that is a very valuable resource and part of

199
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.909
that comes too from, from groups, right? So, like

200
00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:23.200
you mentioned with the wisdom of crowds, I mean,

201
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.409
I think the idea is pretty intuitive too, even

202
00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.929
like when students are doing their homework, you know,

203
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.179
collectively checking with other people and checking their answers

204
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.869
against each other is a great way uh to

205
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.429
help figure things out again, it's not perfect. Um

206
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.780
But when you add more people, you have more,

207
00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:43.640
you have more security in terms of like balancing

208
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.719
out biases, balancing out blind spots. And so you,

209
00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:49.070
you, you have a better shot at getting it

210
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.390
right

211
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.109
and associated with that. Uh Of course, we have

212
00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:57.359
to rely or I mean, we can ask you

213
00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:01.820
if we should rely on experts but um who

214
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.140
are the people we should rely on? Exactly. Is

215
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:11.609
it experts? Is it for example, institutions or for

216
00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:16.469
example, also big numbers of people who all say

217
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:17.549
the same thing?

218
00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:20.440
Yeah, good. I mean, I think all of those

219
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.750
can be good resources. Um AND it might depend

220
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.640
on the details of the particular case and the

221
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.479
particular question. Um BUT they can all be great

222
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.929
one thing. So one thing I kind of sidestep

223
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.840
a bit in the book is making a clear

224
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.900
uh a clear view about who exactly are the

225
00:11:38.909 --> 00:11:41.599
experts and how do we find them? So, those

226
00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:43.869
are good, important and, and hard questions and there's

227
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.380
a lot of discussion these days about what makes

228
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.200
someone an expert and how, and how do you

229
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.159
find them? And there's a lot of good, uh,

230
00:11:50.169 --> 00:11:54.450
epistemology on that, what I think is, you know,

231
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.349
so, along with that pictures idea that either you're

232
00:11:57.359 --> 00:11:59.150
an expert or you're not an expert. Right. It's

233
00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:02.159
either it's a kind of binary where I think

234
00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:04.179
it's a little more helpful to think about things

235
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.289
uh along a scale, right? People are, people have

236
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:11.500
more or less expertise and so people are better

237
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.359
or worse at answering a question. So, whereas there

238
00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.979
might be this challenge of, well, who exactly counts

239
00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:20.140
as an expert and how can I make sure

240
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.510
that they're an expert that that poses a kind

241
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.809
of hurdle that I think we can sometimes at

242
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.669
least answer. It's a lot easier I think for

243
00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.799
us to figure out who's better at answering a

244
00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:33.010
question than we are. Right. So I think it's

245
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.950
pretty easy when it comes to, if I'm trying

246
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.349
to answer a question about World War One, say,

247
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.349
uh there are different friends and colleagues I have

248
00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:43.159
who I think are better, others who I think

249
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:45.369
are worse and based upon what kind of evidence

250
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.520
they've had, how much they thought about it. And

251
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.969
so I can make that determination without having to

252
00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.059
classify them as a full on expert or a

253
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.559
full on novice. I can, I can still think

254
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.250
about, ok, who's better and who's worse and as

255
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.099
long as we can do that, then we already

256
00:13:00.109 --> 00:13:02.489
have, I think this, this way of relying on

257
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.169
others and deferring on them. If we can identify

258
00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:07.190
people who are better at answering the question than

259
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.359
we are, who are more likely to get it

260
00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:11.739
right than we are. Then that's a great resource

261
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.340
that, that gives us a way to rely on

262
00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:15.719
their thinking um, as opposed to our own.

263
00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:20.510
Mhm. But when it comes to these several different

264
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.429
ways that we can rely on others for evaluating

265
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.340
information properly, whether experts, institutions or some other people,

266
00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:35.690
individuals or groups of people. Uh I mean, is

267
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.950
it really reasonable or realistic when it comes to

268
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.369
the idea of us thinking for yourselves that we

269
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.525
alone can really do all the heavy lifting when

270
00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:51.375
it comes to properly evaluating all kinds of information?

271
00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:53.905
I mean, because it, it, it, it, it sounds

272
00:13:53.914 --> 00:13:58.505
so absurd that one single people can just, first

273
00:13:58.515 --> 00:14:02.195
of all amass all the information out there, which

274
00:14:02.205 --> 00:14:06.054
is just ridiculous. But then even if the proper

275
00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:11.114
epistemological tools or cognitive tools to evaluate all of

276
00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:11.494
that.

277
00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:14.109
Right. Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. I

278
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:18.049
mean, and that just makes one way of taking

279
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:21.059
the think for yourself motto where it just seems

280
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.200
utterly absurd. Right? If we, if we were all

281
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.289
each left to our own devices, intellectual devices, there

282
00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:30.650
would be so little of the world that we

283
00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:33.510
would understand and we would be in a terrible

284
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.750
shape. Right. So, one thing that's just great is

285
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760
that we have these other people both in the

286
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.030
past and the present that we can rely on.

287
00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:43.869
Even just thinking about, you know, the state, uh

288
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.030
the state of just different disciplines, things are getting

289
00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:51.729
so particular and precise. Now you can't even be,

290
00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:54.169
I think like an expert in philosophy or even

291
00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:57.659
like in epistemology, it's becoming more and more narrowed

292
00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:00.849
because there's so much information, there's so there's so

293
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:04.359
many new ideas and arguments and evidence coming forth

294
00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.049
to keep on top of a small segment is

295
00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:11.030
already uh AAA heroic deal, never mind taking on

296
00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:14.119
all of it yourself. So the, the analogy I

297
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.030
use in the book is with a, is with

298
00:15:16.039 --> 00:15:19.330
a, a homeowner doing projects around the house to

299
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.609
keep, to keep the house in order. And I

300
00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:24.000
think the same way there, it's, you know, it's

301
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.590
just completely unrealistic to think of any person that

302
00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:28.640
they can just take care of all of their,

303
00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:31.390
their, their, their home needs themselves. Like when it

304
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.830
comes to plumbing work and electric work, these things

305
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.080
require a level of expertise and a level of

306
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.609
knowledge where it's just not, it's not reasonable to

307
00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:43.969
expect uh many people if anyone to have all

308
00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:46.580
of the, all of those relevant skills and abilities

309
00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:50.549
No, this is actually something that I myself just

310
00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:54.109
by doing this show now for six years have

311
00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.859
been, have become increasingly aware of. I've been, it's

312
00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:02.770
just completely impossible for anyone out there to even

313
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.859
have full knowledge of one single discipline. I mean,

314
00:16:06.989 --> 00:16:09.580
if I want to talk with, for example, an

315
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.900
anthropologist about one specific ominous species, I mean, it's

316
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:18.580
better if I try to find someone who is

317
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.609
specialized in that, in that particular species because we

318
00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:26.900
have anthropology and then we have paleoanthropology and then

319
00:16:26.909 --> 00:16:31.190
we have people within paleoanthropology that specialize in the

320
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.940
different species. So, and, and that's perfectly fine because

321
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:39.580
no one has time to really become an expert

322
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.820
on everything. It's just, uh, that idea is just

323
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.340
absurd.

324
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.440
Yeah. No, no, I, I think, uh, I think

325
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.760
that's exactly right. Uh, I mean, it's a great

326
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.909
thing that we have this resource in other people

327
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.150
because without it, we, it would, it would not,

328
00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:54.429
it would not go well for us.

329
00:16:55.169 --> 00:16:59.669
And so, uh, but how can we co correctly

330
00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:04.510
identify the experts because that's an issue, right? Particularly

331
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.400
keeping in mind that there are many people out

332
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.829
there on the internet and elsewhere that present themselves

333
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.880
as experts and they aren't really experts. But then

334
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:23.079
unfortunately, also most people do not have enough knowledge

335
00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:27.598
to be able to, uh, tell if they are

336
00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:29.359
lying or not.

337
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.150
Right. Yeah. Good. So, I mean, I think that

338
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.719
that's one of the key questions. Uh And here,

339
00:17:36.729 --> 00:17:38.739
one thing I like to say about that is

340
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.209
that, that's, you know, the question of who are

341
00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:45.859
the relevant experts is just another question. And when

342
00:17:45.869 --> 00:17:48.859
it comes to answering our questions, some people are

343
00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:51.569
better at answering them than other people. So it

344
00:17:51.589 --> 00:17:55.010
doesn't need to be that we individually always have

345
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.229
to figure out who's the relevant expert to answer

346
00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:01.739
this question. It's fine perfectly. OK to rely on

347
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.280
other people to help us answer that question in

348
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.800
terms of like who are the relevant experts. So

349
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.229
I mean, I um so I think we rely

350
00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:13.260
on other people to help identify the experts. There

351
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.849
are other things I think with, you know, credentials

352
00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:18.500
that help us identify the experts. But that's where

353
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.569
I also think like moving away from just thinking

354
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:24.630
about experts are not experts and thinking instead about

355
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.160
who's in a better or worse position to answer

356
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.310
this question is a little bit easier to handle,

357
00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.609
right? So I don't, you know, if I have

358
00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:34.459
to classify people as you know, who is an

359
00:18:34.469 --> 00:18:38.670
expert about again, say World War One history, that

360
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.489
might be a little bit harder for me to

361
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.439
do to think about who exactly counts as the

362
00:18:42.449 --> 00:18:45.050
experts among the people. I know. But if I,

363
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.089
if I'm just asking myself who's better at answering

364
00:18:48.099 --> 00:18:50.930
those questions than I am, that's pretty easy for

365
00:18:50.939 --> 00:18:52.640
me to answer. I I it's easy for me

366
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.339
to find people who are better than I am.

367
00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:56.310
And so if they're better than I am, um

368
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.349
then that gives me a good reason to rely

369
00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:00.489
on their, on their thinking, right? If there's people

370
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.050
better than them, then even, even even better.

371
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.020
Mhm. Do you think that these questions were particularly

372
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:13.209
relevant, for example, during these past pandemic, regarding the

373
00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:17.689
pandemic itself and also vaccination and perhaps some other

374
00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:23.040
related, let's say scientific questions like climate change and

375
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:23.489
so on.

376
00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:26.800
Yeah, I mean, definitely. So I mean, I started

377
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.819
thinking about the these issues before uh the pandemic.

378
00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:32.579
But I do think when the pan, you know,

379
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.900
in the midst of the pandemic, they became hugely

380
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.660
uh hugely relevant and, and were at the forefront,

381
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.020
which was kind of a nice uh from my

382
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.380
perspective, a happy accident that what I happened to

383
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.969
be working on actually became uh relevant more more

384
00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:51.949
broadly outside of just thinking about epistemology. Um So

385
00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:54.859
I think there are uh you know, it's definitely

386
00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:59.469
important identifying who experts are and relying on experts

387
00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:01.630
and, you know, when we have access to so

388
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.119
much information, uh it's hard, it's easy to be

389
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.880
misled. It's easy to fall for, for, for misinformation.

390
00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:13.239
I think one of the chief problems with how

391
00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:17.790
uh thinking for yourself or doing your own research,

392
00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:20.319
what that led to was the idea that well,

393
00:20:20.329 --> 00:20:22.979
as long as if I'm doing the thinking I'm

394
00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:26.109
not gonna be misled or I won't fall, I

395
00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:28.989
won't be duped or I won't, uh, fall for

396
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.930
misinformation where I think the exact opposite is true.

397
00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:36.510
Right. Right. Because if we don't have expertise, if

398
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.130
it's not a field that we're familiar with, we

399
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.849
don't have a very big body of evidence. We

400
00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:45.569
haven't developed the relevant skills for evaluating that evidence.

401
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.890
Then we're gonna be hopeless at, you know, finding

402
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.760
out who the, the fraudsters are and who, who

403
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.560
the, who the true experts are. So, I don't

404
00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:58.050
think so. I think thinking for yourself got put

405
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.589
forward as a kind of safeguard, like protect yourself,

406
00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:04.219
protect your mind, think for yourself. Um BUT it

407
00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.959
does the exact opposite. And I mean, and I

408
00:21:05.969 --> 00:21:07.849
think it's easy to see that in, in other

409
00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:10.689
cases too. So, I mean, one, you know, if

410
00:21:10.699 --> 00:21:15.589
we think about um medical diagnoses in general, just,

411
00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:17.729
you know, setting aside the pandemic, you know, if

412
00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:19.869
I'm not, uh you know, if I'm not feeling

413
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.510
well, I can go to the doctor and, and

414
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.869
have them uh diagnose what's uh what's wrong with

415
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.099
me or I can try to run my own

416
00:21:28.109 --> 00:21:31.229
test and make my own evaluation of what's uh

417
00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:35.349
of what's going on. The self diagnosis is, is

418
00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:37.699
notoriously a bad way to go about figuring out

419
00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:40.280
what's going on. It's not that doing my own

420
00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.260
research in that way is a nice safeguard from,

421
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:46.979
you know, the potential bad actor uh doctor. It's

422
00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:49.619
actually more likely to, to mislead me and send

423
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.819
me on, send me down some trail that's not

424
00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:55.239
uh that's not gonna be helpful. So I think,

425
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.479
you know, obviously the, you know, the pandemic and

426
00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:00.599
you mentioned climate change too. Both of those issues

427
00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:03.099
especially here uh in the United States are just

428
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:06.780
so politicized that I think that adds a whole

429
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.550
another layer of complication into things. But I think

430
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.739
uh the, you know, the, the value of thinking

431
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.589
for yourself really masked a lot of problems or,

432
00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:19.459
and led to a lot of problems because it

433
00:22:19.469 --> 00:22:22.660
gave us, I think a false sense of security

434
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.689
that as long as you're thinking for yourself, you

435
00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:27.880
are bound to, um, bound to be fun. In

436
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.390
fact, going back to that open letter, that's what

437
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.050
I, that's what kind of didn't sit well with

438
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.540
me is this idea of, you know, we want

439
00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.520
our students to think for ourselves, for themselves. But

440
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.609
if they think for themselves and come up with,

441
00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:42.949
um, you know, terrible or outrageous answers, we don't

442
00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:45.239
think, well, great. At least you thought for yourself

443
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.329
about it. We think. No, that's, that's the problem.

444
00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:48.959
Like we also want people to get the answer,

445
00:22:48.969 --> 00:22:51.800
right. And that's also an important, uh, an important

446
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.630
thing, not just thinking for yourself but getting the

447
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:53.880
answer.

448
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.170
Right. Yeah. And I guess that the example of

449
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.630
the medical doctors is a very good one because

450
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.569
actually it's not just the fact that, uh, just

451
00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:06.479
for you to become a doctor, you have to

452
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:09.030
go through, I don't know how many years of

453
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.569
training. I mean, it's a huge number of years.

454
00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:15.010
But then also if you are a specialist, I

455
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.489
mean, you, you go through even more training and

456
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.469
then, and, and that's, it's that way, it works

457
00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:25.430
that way because, I mean, just for a single

458
00:23:25.439 --> 00:23:30.790
organ in your body, there's so much information. That's

459
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.520
one of the reasons why if you go to

460
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.569
a general practitioner many times they refer you to

461
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:40.260
a specialist because just what you can know about

462
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.540
the liver itself, the heart, the kidneys is such

463
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.510
a huge amount of information that a specialist is

464
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.510
even better prepared to, for example, properly diagnose you

465
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.349
than even just a general practitioner. And the general

466
00:23:56.359 --> 00:24:00.939
practitioner already knows much more information than just a

467
00:24:00.949 --> 00:24:03.170
common person on the street.

468
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.109
Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. Yeah.

469
00:24:06.939 --> 00:24:11.339
So, but going beyond experts, do you think that

470
00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:15.660
there would be any, let's say rules of thumb

471
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.589
that people could follow when deciding who to believe

472
00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:23.280
and who to trust?

473
00:24:26.439 --> 00:24:29.170
So, I mean, I think so, like, like I

474
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.630
said, I think it comes down to thinking about

475
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.369
what people's epistemic position is on the question or

476
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.969
how likely they are to get the question, right?

477
00:24:37.979 --> 00:24:39.579
And so I, I do think that there are

478
00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:43.790
some questions that are relevant to assessing that, that

479
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.339
are, that are helpful. So thinking about, you know,

480
00:24:47.349 --> 00:24:51.670
how much um, evidence and what kind of quality

481
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.489
of evidence, um, the person in question has relative

482
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.449
to the issue, um, thinking about what kind of

483
00:24:58.459 --> 00:25:01.790
skills or abilities they have in terms of like,

484
00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:05.579
um, assessing that evidence. And so I could have,

485
00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:09.420
I could have all the medical test evidence of

486
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.680
some specialist, but I don't know what, you know,

487
00:25:11.689 --> 00:25:13.479
I, I can't make heads or tails of it.

488
00:25:13.489 --> 00:25:16.209
I can't, I can look at the, the scans

489
00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:17.750
and it's not gonna do me any good to

490
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.849
have the scans if I don't know how to

491
00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:23.790
um how to properly interpret them, you know, thinking

492
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.949
about intelligence, thinking about intellectual virtue, I think, um

493
00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:31.989
can be, can be helpful as well. Um But

494
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.260
I do think the maybe the best resource there

495
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.510
is not having to make all those determinations yourself,

496
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.939
but, but also relying on how other people are

497
00:25:43.949 --> 00:25:46.790
thinking about who the relevant experts are. Right? So

498
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.550
you don't like that's part, you know, of the

499
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.329
more general theme of the book is you don't

500
00:25:51.339 --> 00:25:54.530
have to do it all yourself, right? So you,

501
00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.250
you're confronted with the question of who to believe.

502
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.969
Um But in answering that question, don't be afraid

503
00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:03.609
to rely on how other people are making that

504
00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:07.280
determination and who they see as being better and

505
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.560
worse at answering that question because that's a valuable,

506
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.469
that's a valuable intellectual resource too.

507
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.510
And that's actually something that people should not be

508
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.510
ashamed of. Right. About asking questions, asking about things

509
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.979
they don't know about. Uh, THAT'S actually, I guess

510
00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:29.260
something that we could call an intellectual virtue. Right.

511
00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:32.109
Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, I think part of

512
00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:35.339
it is, you know, intellectual humility in terms of,

513
00:26:35.349 --> 00:26:38.060
like, not assuming that you can figure everything out

514
00:26:38.069 --> 00:26:43.469
yourself. Um, BUT being able to, um find others

515
00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:45.650
and defer to them also, I think as, as

516
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.650
an intellectual virtue and it's what's funny is we

517
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.560
do it in lots of other areas in our

518
00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:51.719
life. Like if we're going to buy, if we're

519
00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:54.290
going to go buy some product, right? We're, we're

520
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.449
gonna look at what other people have to say

521
00:26:56.489 --> 00:27:00.130
what other, what consumer ratings magazines have said about

522
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.010
them. We're happy to rely on other people's insights

523
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.439
there. There's something about thinking though where I think

524
00:27:08.449 --> 00:27:11.050
we have this like default view, like, well, I

525
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.199
can think as well as anyone else can. And

526
00:27:14.209 --> 00:27:16.199
so there's no need for me to rely on

527
00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:18.449
other people there. But, you know, as we've been

528
00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:20.959
talking about, it's just, that's just, I mean, when

529
00:27:20.969 --> 00:27:23.439
you think about it, that's just not right at

530
00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:27.219
all. Like thinking like anything else requires all kinds

531
00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:30.689
of skills or requires all kinds of information and

532
00:27:30.699 --> 00:27:32.640
we're not all the same with regards to that,

533
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.500
right? So we have different people have different insights,

534
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.400
different kinds of expertise. And so it's, it, it's

535
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.660
a shame to miss out on, on those advantages

536
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.979
and even, I guess taking a step back earlier,

537
00:27:44.989 --> 00:27:48.229
we talked about the philosophers, for example. And I

538
00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:52.410
guess that even many times it's obvious that even

539
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.260
if, I mean, even if you don't ask questions

540
00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:00.459
directly to other people, you are still being influenced

541
00:28:00.469 --> 00:28:03.000
by the ideas of other people, right? I mean,

542
00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:06.089
just look at the work of Kent, for example,

543
00:28:06.099 --> 00:28:10.489
he was directly influenced by you by the car

544
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.239
and by a ton of other people. I mean,

545
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.140
they are reading the work of other people. So

546
00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:20.099
how can you claim that you're thinking for yourself

547
00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:20.650
alone?

548
00:28:21.569 --> 00:28:24.150
Well, even, I mean, even just in terms of

549
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.890
developing your own abilities to think, right? So you,

550
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.430
you gain concepts from other people, right? You, the

551
00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:35.810
whole process of education is one that goes well

552
00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:38.770
because you rely on other people, right? Uh If,

553
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.530
if you had to educate yourself, teach yourself everything,

554
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.530
I mean, it would be, it would be um

555
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.920
it'd be a bad picture and that, that's where

556
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.569
I think um we need to be careful to

557
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:54.000
distinguish um epistemic autonomy, which I think is a

558
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.130
value thing from intellectual individualism. This kind of idea

559
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.760
of like I can do it all on my

560
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.550
own. And I think that picture as you illustrated,

561
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.280
if we, if we really stop to look at

562
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.050
it closely, just doesn't, doesn't make any sense. That's

563
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.670
not the kind of beings we are, we don't

564
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.130
do anything all on our own. Like we are,

565
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.050
we live such interdependent lives and that's not a,

566
00:29:15.069 --> 00:29:17.219
that's not a problem. We're able to do so

567
00:29:17.229 --> 00:29:19.469
much more because of that. Right. It's, it's a,

568
00:29:19.479 --> 00:29:22.310
it's a, it's a great resource again to have

569
00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:24.339
these people that we can rely on, to gain

570
00:29:24.349 --> 00:29:27.239
their insights, to learn from them to be mentored

571
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.520
by them. And so we shouldn't be ashamed of

572
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.560
that. We should embrace it.

573
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.560
And I guess that we can also add here

574
00:29:34.569 --> 00:29:38.640
the fact that when we talk about human knowledge,

575
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.339
it's usually accumulated knowledge, there is knowledge that people

576
00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:47.540
have accumulated across many, many generations. And so if

577
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.500
you were legitimately thinking for yourself, you would have

578
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.140
to go to the bank to the man and

579
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.709
start from scratch,

580
00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.369
right? If everyone had to start from square one,

581
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.729
then, right? We, I mean, however, even the best

582
00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:03.920
and brightest could only advance so far and then

583
00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.750
the next generation had to start back again. Yeah,

584
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.239
progress would be virtually non existent.

585
00:30:10.189 --> 00:30:14.530
So let's get into some objections to your argument

586
00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.010
and you also address them in your book. So

587
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.579
first of all, there's the autonomy objection. So what

588
00:30:22.589 --> 00:30:25.420
is it based on? And do you think that

589
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.160
there are perhaps good points to it or not?

590
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.880
Yeah. So, I mean, I think one question is

591
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.400
just what do we, how should we understand uh

592
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:41.359
intellectual autonomy or epistemic autonomy? And I think we

593
00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:45.349
have to be careful there that different ways of

594
00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:49.630
understanding it. Um SOME are valuable, some are not

595
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.819
valuable, but they can all kind of hide behind

596
00:30:52.829 --> 00:30:57.400
the banner of autonomy which everyone rightly values like.

597
00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.910
So autonomy is valuable. But we gotta be careful.

598
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.819
I think how we think about the relevant kind

599
00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.300
of autonomy. So I do think 11 way to

600
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.790
understand uh epistemic autonomy is this kind of individualism

601
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.969
whereas you do it all yourself. Um And that

602
00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:16.319
would raise a problem for the view that it's

603
00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:18.599
OK not to think for yourself. Because if like,

604
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:21.839
if what autonomy is, is doing it all yourself,

605
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:25.180
then outsourcing and deferring to other people is like

606
00:31:25.189 --> 00:31:29.979
in direct contrast um to autonomy. But, you know,

607
00:31:29.989 --> 00:31:31.660
in part, for the reasons that we've just talked

608
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.060
about, I don't think that's a very plausible view

609
00:31:35.069 --> 00:31:39.130
of, of autonomy, both intellectual and mo more generally,

610
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.839
right? So even if we just think set aside

611
00:31:41.849 --> 00:31:44.229
the intellectual case and just think about, you know,

612
00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:48.540
autonomous citizens, the autonomous citizen isn't one who relies

613
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.020
on no one else for anything like that would

614
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.300
be like the ideal. There would be like the

615
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.969
hermit who lives on their own, makes their own

616
00:31:55.979 --> 00:31:59.390
clothes, grows their own food. But I mean, that

617
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.880
might be an OK way to live your life.

618
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.219
But that's not the only way to live an

619
00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:04.390
autonomous life. Like we, we are able to do

620
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.869
much more to have much more freedom by inter

621
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.989
by our interdependent lies by relying on other people.

622
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
So I think the idea of autonomy as individualism

623
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.719
would be, would present a problem for the thesis

624
00:32:16.729 --> 00:32:19.170
of the book. But that, that's not really when

625
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.050
we look at it a, a kind of a

626
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.869
value. I do think that there are, there are

627
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:29.099
two other ways to picture uh epistemic autonomy that

628
00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:31.689
are valuable. But I think both of those don't

629
00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:34.750
conflict with, with the thesis. So 11 way I

630
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.339
think of thinking of epistemic autonomy is a kind

631
00:32:37.349 --> 00:32:41.000
of freedom. So like you're intellectually autonomous, when you're

632
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.410
allowed to think about the questions that you wanna

633
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.410
think about, you can pursue the inquiries that you

634
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.579
wanna pursue. No one's telling you what to think

635
00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:50.500
about or how to think about it. You have

636
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.449
that freedom. But I think you can have that

637
00:32:53.459 --> 00:32:57.060
freedom while deferring to other people and relying on,

638
00:32:57.069 --> 00:32:59.619
on, on, on their insights and their wisdom. So

639
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.959
there's nothing about um having to do it yourself

640
00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:05.560
in order to think about the questions you want

641
00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:08.209
to think about. And then the other kind of

642
00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:11.760
epistemic autonomy I think is, is, is valuable, is

643
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.369
a kind of intellectual virtue where I see it

644
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.069
as good uh executive management of your intellectual life.

645
00:33:20.079 --> 00:33:23.719
So the the autonomous person makes good decisions in

646
00:33:23.729 --> 00:33:26.109
terms of how to inquire when they should think

647
00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:29.329
about things for themselves and when they should rely

648
00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:31.750
on someone else instead. And so they manage their

649
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.260
intellectual life in in virtuous, in, in good ways.

650
00:33:36.469 --> 00:33:38.369
Now, that too, I think doesn't conflict with the

651
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.670
idea that you don't think for yourself, uh at

652
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.709
least very often because it could be that the,

653
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:45.180
the, the best way to manage your life is

654
00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:48.040
gonna require a lot of deference. Right? And given

655
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.770
again the considerations we've talked about how specialized knowledge

656
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.140
is and how much information there is out there.

657
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.670
If we're curious individuals who want to have answers

658
00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.680
to more than just a couple questions, we're gonna

659
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:03.569
have to be relying quite extensively on the insights

660
00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:07.209
and the intellectual work of other people. So, you

661
00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:09.688
know, long story short, I think there's a number

662
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.290
of different ways to think about epistemic autonomy. The

663
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.770
only one that I think would really raise a

664
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.870
problem. This kind of intellectual individualism isn't really something

665
00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:20.379
that we ought to be valued in the first

666
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:21.010
place.

667
00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.000
So in your thesis, there's definitely room for at

668
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.708
least a version of autonomy, right? But perhaps there's

669
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.790
not much room for what we could perhaps call

670
00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.139
uh isolation, right? I mean, it's uh being autonomous

671
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:43.370
is not the same as doing things in an

672
00:34:43.379 --> 00:34:45.188
isolated way,

673
00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.399
right. Correct. Yeah. And so in the, in the

674
00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.915
book too, I, I rely quite happy on a

675
00:34:49.925 --> 00:34:53.705
lot of um feminist philosophers who coined the idea

676
00:34:53.715 --> 00:34:56.853
of relational autonomy that we actually have autonomy in

677
00:34:56.864 --> 00:34:59.834
relation to other people. That that's what gives us

678
00:34:59.844 --> 00:35:01.905
our, our autonomy. And I think the same thing

679
00:35:01.915 --> 00:35:05.264
carries over into our intellectual world. We can be,

680
00:35:05.274 --> 00:35:08.604
you know, I'm pro intellectual autonomy. I think it's

681
00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:11.024
a great thing. It's just the way we ought

682
00:35:11.034 --> 00:35:13.324
to think about it is a way that's consistent

683
00:35:13.334 --> 00:35:16.215
with interdependence because that's the kind of creatures that

684
00:35:16.225 --> 00:35:16.675
we are,

685
00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:21.709
by the way, when it comes to intellectual individualism.

686
00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:24.919
I am curious about this aspect and I'm not

687
00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:27.389
sure if this is an unfair question because I'm

688
00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:31.750
not sure if you looked into this specifically yourself.

689
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:37.000
But do you have any idea if uh or

690
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.439
whether it is, uh it has something to do

691
00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:41.959
with culture? There is what I mean by that

692
00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:44.479
is we tend to live at least in the

693
00:35:44.489 --> 00:35:50.290
West, in individualist societies. Do you think that intellectual

694
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.300
individualism could stem from that? And perhaps if we

695
00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.510
went into, let's say Eastern Asian societies where cultures

696
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.010
tend to be more collectivist that perhaps we wouldn't

697
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.909
find so much of this issue.

698
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.169
Yeah. No, that's uh that's a great question and

699
00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:13.719
I think a quite plausible hypothesis. So, yeah, like

700
00:36:13.729 --> 00:36:16.169
I, I haven't looked at that but that is

701
00:36:16.179 --> 00:36:19.530
what my guess would be is that um the,

702
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.979
the idea of intellectual individualism wouldn't even look appealing

703
00:36:23.989 --> 00:36:26.340
to, to a lot of cultures that are more

704
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:31.310
focused on uh collective, the collective life. Um Yeah,

705
00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.820
you're right in the West and I think especially

706
00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:38.139
uh in the United States individual individuals and reign

707
00:36:38.149 --> 00:36:41.250
so strongly that I think it is, it's plausible.

708
00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.040
That's a carry over that. Ok. Do everything yourself,

709
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.449
don't have to rely on anyone else. That's the,

710
00:36:47.459 --> 00:36:51.479
that's the way to be. Um, BUT as you

711
00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:52.989
say, I mean, I, yeah, I think that's a

712
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.080
mistake but I do think that there, it's plausible

713
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.879
that there are a lot of cultural connections there.

714
00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:59.379
So, you know, it'd be interesting to see some

715
00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:03.050
cross cultural studies that look at how different uh

716
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.889
different cultures value individualism. And if there are these,

717
00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:08.489
these distinctions that match.

718
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.209
So another objection to your thesis that you explore

719
00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:16.840
in the book is the Free Rider objections. So

720
00:37:16.989 --> 00:37:19.000
what is it really about? I mean, is it

721
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.989
about the idea that perhaps if you are, if

722
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.860
you are relying on others, perhaps you are taking

723
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.310
advantage of the work they've done is that it?

724
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.449
Yeah. So, I mean, the, the kind of I

725
00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:35.370
take it the classical problematic Free Rider case is

726
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:37.959
when you have, uh you know, a bunch of

727
00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:43.149
roommates that share some common area and they, they've

728
00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:46.770
made a decision to kind of equally share the,

729
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.080
the clean up and the maintenance of that, the

730
00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.719
kitchen say, uh but then whenever it comes to

731
00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:54.949
cleaning up, you know, the dishes, there's this one

732
00:37:54.959 --> 00:37:57.330
roommate who just always kind of sits back and

733
00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.250
waits and knows that someone else will get it

734
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.820
first. And so never ends up doing their share.

735
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.239
They get to enjoy the nice clean kitchen. But

736
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.070
they never actually put any work in. That looks

737
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.379
like a problem. And we want, we wanna like

738
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:14.709
confront that roommate and say, um, you're doing something

739
00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:18.699
wrong and free riding looks like a uh one

740
00:38:18.709 --> 00:38:21.179
way to make that charge. So I think the

741
00:38:21.189 --> 00:38:24.389
parallel worry would be that if you're not thinking

742
00:38:24.399 --> 00:38:28.550
for yourself, you're just relying on the intellectual efforts

743
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.750
of others. You're a kind of intellectual free rider,

744
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.139
you're gaining all their insights, but you're not doing

745
00:38:35.149 --> 00:38:38.280
any of the intellectual work yourself. You're not, you're

746
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.649
not giving them any insights. You're not, you're not

747
00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:43.800
making any discoveries for them. You're just a taker

748
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.689
and uh just like the roommate, that's a kind

749
00:38:46.699 --> 00:38:49.409
of problematic way to be a member of a,

750
00:38:49.419 --> 00:38:53.620
a community. Um So that's the objection. I don't,

751
00:38:53.629 --> 00:38:56.429
I don't think it's a, it's a good objection.

752
00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:00.840
Um BECAUSE I think the important difference between the

753
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.959
roommate case and the intellectual case is that in

754
00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:06.300
the roommate case, we are, each of the roommates

755
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:10.379
were imagining have an equal responsibility to maintain the,

756
00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:14.080
the clean cleanliness of the kitchen. Whereas in the

757
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.929
intellectual world, we don't have, we don't all share

758
00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:21.280
an equal responsibility to be finding answers to these

759
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:25.080
different questions, right? So we do think that specialists

760
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.590
have a, have a special duty, they have a

761
00:39:27.794 --> 00:39:32.024
responsibility to find answers in their area of specialization,

762
00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:34.804
right? Chemists should be the ones who have a

763
00:39:34.814 --> 00:39:38.645
extra duty to find answers to questions of chemistry

764
00:39:38.655 --> 00:39:41.995
and physicists, to questions of physics, philosophers, to questions

765
00:39:42.004 --> 00:39:44.790
in philosophy, we don't think that everyone has like

766
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.409
a equal responsibility to be answering this question. So,

767
00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:49.459
like you and you and I don't have any,

768
00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:52.350
any sort of, I think responsibility to be answering

769
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.370
questions of say uh biology, that's for the biologist

770
00:39:57.379 --> 00:40:00.280
to do. So, I mean, are we, are we

771
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:03.620
biology knowledge free riders? Um So I want, I

772
00:40:03.629 --> 00:40:06.050
wanna think, well, if we are then I think

773
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.919
it's not kind of a, it's not problematic. Uh

774
00:40:08.929 --> 00:40:11.919
It's, there's, there's not this responsibility that we have.

775
00:40:11.929 --> 00:40:14.770
So it's unlike the roommate case where something where

776
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.760
something goes wrong.

777
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.810
Mhm. Uh Also because in this particular case, if

778
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.330
people are contributing in some way, if they're doing,

779
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.560
let's say their fair share, whatever the fair share

780
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:34.250
would be intellectually speaking. I mean, isn't that good

781
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.169
enough because, and again, we can't do all the

782
00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:42.169
work ourselves and everyone is relying on the work

783
00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:44.360
of many other people.

784
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.649
Yeah, I mean, I would go even a little

785
00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:49.449
a step further and say it, it's fine if

786
00:40:49.459 --> 00:40:53.459
you don't do anything intellectually. So in intellectual contributions

787
00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:56.030
are one way to contribute to society, but they're

788
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.260
not the only way, right? So maybe you're not

789
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.239
doing anything in terms of like being on the

790
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.010
frontiers of knowledge, but you're providing care for important

791
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.850
people or you're providing entertainment or you're making delicious

792
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.439
food of those are all important contributions to, to

793
00:41:13.449 --> 00:41:18.610
a society. And so II I, we shouldn't think

794
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.169
that everyone has a responsibility to be doing all

795
00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:23.489
the things and contributing to all the different areas

796
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.929
of society, the intellectual realms, the same thing. Like

797
00:41:26.939 --> 00:41:29.840
there, it's fine to, to not, to not be

798
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.250
involved there again, if you want to be great,

799
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.399
like it's, uh, it's open and, uh you're free

800
00:41:36.409 --> 00:41:39.250
to pursue it. I just think there's nothing wrong.

801
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.610
It's ok. If you say it's not for me,

802
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.850
I'd rather do something else.

803
00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:46.939
Uh Also because even when it comes to non

804
00:41:47.199 --> 00:41:52.169
intellectual activities, those are really at the base of

805
00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:55.889
society and even what allows for the intellectual activities

806
00:41:55.899 --> 00:41:58.010
to take place. Right? I mean, if we didn't

807
00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:03.649
have the, is uh people working the essential jobs,

808
00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:06.580
society wouldn't even function to begin.

809
00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:09.959
I mean, that, that is where, you know, I

810
00:42:09.969 --> 00:42:12.629
think the easiest way you could make the case

811
00:42:12.639 --> 00:42:14.399
for it being ok, not to think for yourself

812
00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:16.290
was to think about the extreme, you know, of

813
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.469
someone who's living on the very edge of poverty

814
00:42:19.479 --> 00:42:22.840
and has to be working around the clock to

815
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.000
provide for themselves and their family and there's just

816
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.179
no room for a Christmas to say, wait, you

817
00:42:28.189 --> 00:42:31.280
haven't been, you haven't been thinking about these questions.

818
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.080
You haven't been inquiring about these, these different issues.

819
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.090
Um What kind of an intellectual wrong you've committed?

820
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.810
I think there's, there's just, there's no problem there.

821
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.689
I mean, there's a problem with maybe the state

822
00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:43.709
of the world that makes them live in that,

823
00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:45.850
in, in that, in, in that way. But there's

824
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.540
not an intellectual failure on their part for not

825
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.389
thinking for themselves and, and not inquiring about these

826
00:42:51.399 --> 00:42:51.919
issues.

827
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.750
And I think that makes for a great segue

828
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.889
to my next question. And this objection is probably

829
00:42:58.899 --> 00:43:01.830
the one that really bothers me the most. There

830
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.560
is the Socratic objection, the idea coming from or

831
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:11.280
supposedly from Socrates that an unexamined life is not

832
00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.929
worth living. I mean, I, I say that this

833
00:43:14.939 --> 00:43:17.689
really bothers me a lot because it seems so

834
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:23.679
pitic, it seems so elitist in intellectually speaking. I

835
00:43:23.689 --> 00:43:27.820
mean, the idea that if you don't examine your

836
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:32.719
life or whatever aspects Socrates might have been referring

837
00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:36.250
to there, then your life is not even worth

838
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.899
living.

839
00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:40.780
Yeah. Uh, ONE quick side note. So my, uh,

840
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.399
my, my daughter came home from school and this

841
00:43:43.409 --> 00:43:45.820
is a few years ago and told me that

842
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.919
she had, they had talked about a philosopher in

843
00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:51.120
school and, uh, it was Socrates and she said

844
00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.870
he said that the unexamined life is not worth

845
00:43:53.879 --> 00:43:56.469
living. And I was like, yeah, and, and her

846
00:43:56.479 --> 00:43:59.620
response was, that's a little harsh, isn't it? And,

847
00:43:59.629 --> 00:44:01.520
uh, that's kind of my response to it. It

848
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.939
does seem, uh, it's, it's overly harsh. I get,

849
00:44:04.949 --> 00:44:07.209
I do, I do feel the tension though too

850
00:44:07.219 --> 00:44:09.979
because I mean, I, you know, as a philosopher,

851
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.169
I really like, especially philosophical questions. I, you know,

852
00:44:14.179 --> 00:44:17.370
I, I would encourage, you know, people to think

853
00:44:17.379 --> 00:44:19.780
about them. I think they're great things that, um,

854
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.540
to think about. But, you know, for the objection

855
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.239
to go through, it has to be stronger than

856
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.030
that. It has to be like, and you've done

857
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.239
something wrong um, by not thinking about it and

858
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.780
that's where I think it's, it's just, it's just

859
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.280
overly strong. So even if, you know, I think

860
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.500
the most, perhaps the most plausible way to put

861
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.860
the, the, the objection is that, you know, these

862
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.750
questions about how should I live? My life are

863
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.129
like so important that you, you know, they're, they're

864
00:44:49.139 --> 00:44:52.199
gonna determine your, the whole course of your existence,

865
00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:57.159
you better think about them um for yourself. But

866
00:44:57.169 --> 00:44:59.760
I think their, their importance actually points in the

867
00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.300
other direction, right? So if answering these questions is

868
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.459
very important, it's really important to get it right.

869
00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:07.979
And it's really important to get the right answer.

870
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.239
And if you know the setup of the problem

871
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.379
is you can find people who are better at

872
00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:16.270
answering those questions than you are, then the importance

873
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.659
of getting it right would actually lead you to

874
00:45:18.669 --> 00:45:20.959
rely on their thinking more than, more than your

875
00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:23.540
own, right? Because if you wanna get it right,

876
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.179
the best way to get it right is to

877
00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:28.050
rely on someone else, then you should rely on

878
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.250
someone else. Even regarding these questions in terms of,

879
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.989
you know, ethics and philosophy and things like that.

880
00:45:35.209 --> 00:45:37.350
And also, I don't know if you would agree

881
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.070
with this point, but isn't there also somewhat of

882
00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.510
an assumption here that perhaps when it comes to

883
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.909
the idea of the unexamined life, that perhaps it

884
00:45:47.919 --> 00:45:52.239
is just too common for people to just go

885
00:45:52.419 --> 00:45:55.909
mindlessly through their lives. I mean, it's because it's

886
00:45:55.919 --> 00:46:01.165
not because someone is not thinking about whatever kind

887
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:05.264
of issue like a professional philosopher or using the

888
00:46:05.274 --> 00:46:09.314
technical terminology to think about things or something like

889
00:46:09.324 --> 00:46:14.064
that, that most people do not think at all

890
00:46:14.074 --> 00:46:17.304
about, for example, their own condition, the meaning of

891
00:46:17.314 --> 00:46:20.905
their life and other stuff like that. Ethics, for

892
00:46:20.915 --> 00:46:21.625
example.

893
00:46:21.885 --> 00:46:25.050
Right. Yeah. So, I mean, there is a, so

894
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.909
maybe a different take on the objection to be

895
00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:32.320
like, let's just think about the questions, there are

896
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.379
certain questions that people should confront or maybe that

897
00:46:36.389 --> 00:46:40.350
everyone should confront. Um But even if that's true.

898
00:46:40.639 --> 00:46:44.350
Um So, I mean, I'm not, I'm not sure.

899
00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:46.300
I, I feel some pull to that but I'm

900
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.020
not sure. But let's just say it's true that

901
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.260
there are questions that everyone should be thinking about

902
00:46:51.919 --> 00:46:54.219
that still leaves open how they go about thinking

903
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:57.199
about them, right? So if everyone needs to confront

904
00:46:57.209 --> 00:46:58.899
these questions, it doesn't mean that they need to

905
00:46:58.909 --> 00:47:02.659
answer them by thinking for themselves about them. Right?

906
00:47:02.669 --> 00:47:04.899
So maybe you should have an answer, but the

907
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:07.459
best way to get that answer is to rely

908
00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:09.580
on someone else and to rely on their thinking

909
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.949
because they're gonna be better at answering that question

910
00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:14.860
than you are. So, if it's about the questions

911
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.780
more than the answers, and I think then that's

912
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.840
compatible with the thesis of the book in the

913
00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.739
sense of like, ok, maybe you need to confront

914
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.469
the question, just don't go from that to thinking

915
00:47:23.479 --> 00:47:25.010
that you're the best suited or you're the one

916
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.409
who has to come up with the answer.

917
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.899
And then another objection is the objection of epistemic

918
00:47:31.909 --> 00:47:38.590
vulnerability. So what does that objection uh refer to?

919
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.340
Exactly.

920
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.889
Yeah. So we, I think we've talked about this

921
00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:44.989
a little bit uh kind of hidden uh when

922
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.209
we talked earlier about uh the, the pandemic. But

923
00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:52.139
I think the idea is when you defer to

924
00:47:52.149 --> 00:47:54.139
someone else, which is what I wanna say. It's

925
00:47:54.149 --> 00:47:57.179
perfectly fine to do. When you defer to someone

926
00:47:57.189 --> 00:47:59.919
else, you rely on their thinking, you rely on,

927
00:47:59.929 --> 00:48:03.500
on, on their, their, their insights. And when you

928
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:07.629
do that, you make yourself vulnerable to their errors,

929
00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:11.469
right? Because even even the best experts still have

930
00:48:11.479 --> 00:48:15.459
biases, they still have blind spots, they're still fallible

931
00:48:15.469 --> 00:48:18.800
thinkers and you know, worse yet there's still like

932
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:22.320
there's even bad players out there who are intentionally

933
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:26.159
um trying to, to deceive you and manipulate you.

934
00:48:26.909 --> 00:48:31.129
So there's, there's dan there's real intellectual dangers out

935
00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:35.469
there um that come with deferring to other people.

936
00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:39.929
So that's right. I mean, the, the problem with

937
00:48:39.939 --> 00:48:43.010
the objection, I think is twofold, one is thinking

938
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.669
for yourself is not an invulnerable thing. So when

939
00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:50.179
you think for yourself, you two have biases, you

940
00:48:50.189 --> 00:48:53.449
two have blind spots, you two are fallible. Uh

941
00:48:53.459 --> 00:48:57.229
And so thinking for yourself isn't a kind of

942
00:48:57.239 --> 00:49:01.419
safeguard that makes you invulnerable. You're, you're vulnerable to

943
00:49:01.429 --> 00:49:03.449
all the same kind of errors that the expert

944
00:49:03.459 --> 00:49:05.949
is. In fact, you're more vulnerable. Like because you,

945
00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:08.820
like if you lack expertise, you're even more likely

946
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.409
to get it wrong and there's even less security

947
00:49:11.419 --> 00:49:14.439
there. So I think we all kind of like

948
00:49:14.449 --> 00:49:19.479
crave a kind of invulnerability. But so one part

949
00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:21.750
of the response to the objection is that that's

950
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.790
just not possible, like no matter how we go

951
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.479
about our, our inquiry, we're gonna be vulnerable, we

952
00:49:27.489 --> 00:49:29.629
can get it wrong and that can have, you

953
00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:33.040
know, that can have quite bad consequences. That's, that's,

954
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.600
that's kind of our, our intellectual uh lot in

955
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.909
life. The lesson I think is um we need

956
00:49:40.919 --> 00:49:45.530
to take steps to protect ourselves when we can

957
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.760
to to put an intellectual safeguards. The mistake I

958
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:53.129
think is to think that those intellectual safeguards come

959
00:49:53.139 --> 00:49:56.550
from thinking for yourself, right? So just like with

960
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.679
the medical self diagnosis, your self diagnosis isn't a

961
00:50:00.689 --> 00:50:05.060
good uh safeguard to your doctor, right? Your doctor

962
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:07.459
may, you know, maybe you need to have safeguards

963
00:50:07.469 --> 00:50:09.830
there, but that's where we think about having second

964
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.199
opinions, right? You go to another expert, another expert,

965
00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:16.129
right? Someone who else, someone, someone else who is

966
00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:20.290
highly qualified has the relevant evidence and expertise to

967
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.449
make that determination in relying on multiple experts. You

968
00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:26.340
have a kind of safeguard from the errors or

969
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:30.330
manipulation of one expert, not by thinking for yourself

970
00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.409
and, and, and the same thing with institutions, I

971
00:50:32.419 --> 00:50:34.729
mean, I think we can have institutions in place

972
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.229
that provide a kind of safeguard that prevent bad

973
00:50:38.239 --> 00:50:41.750
actors or, or can, can more easily help identify

974
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.780
bad actors. Um THEN we could as ourselves, right?

975
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.929
So I think the mistake with the vulnerability objection

976
00:50:47.939 --> 00:50:50.489
is to think that well, as long as I

977
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:54.830
also wrestle with the question or the answer myself,

978
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.800
I'll be able to figure out who's making the

979
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.500
mistakes or who's the bad player who has the

980
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:03.080
biases. And that's just not true. Like I think

981
00:51:03.459 --> 00:51:07.870
you're just one person and you're actually both, you

982
00:51:07.879 --> 00:51:09.939
know, more often than not, not the best suited

983
00:51:09.949 --> 00:51:13.500
to make those determinations. So thinking for yourself just

984
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:15.610
isn't the kind of safeguard that I think people

985
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.419
put it out there, um put it out there

986
00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:17.840
to be

987
00:51:19.379 --> 00:51:23.959
and then there's also the understanding objection. So what

988
00:51:23.969 --> 00:51:28.639
are people referring to exactly when they talk about

989
00:51:28.649 --> 00:51:30.479
or they use this objection?

990
00:51:31.709 --> 00:51:34.899
Yeah. So this is, I think AAA good objection

991
00:51:34.909 --> 00:51:37.489
too, which is, you know, we can get a

992
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.620
lot of intellectual goods by um deferring to other

993
00:51:41.629 --> 00:51:45.379
people, right? So when I defer to an expert,

994
00:51:45.389 --> 00:51:47.679
I can get a true belief, I can get

995
00:51:47.689 --> 00:51:50.929
a justified belief. I can get knowledge. Those are

996
00:51:50.939 --> 00:51:55.750
all good intellectual states. But one thing I can't

997
00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.610
get is understanding. So understanding it seems is something

998
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.300
that you can only get by wrestling with the

999
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:09.010
evidence yourself, right? So you can't understand something just

1000
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.510
by someone else telling you, you have to think

1001
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.030
through it yourself to really understand it. So the

1002
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:21.760
objection goes, if there's this epistemic valuable thing, understanding,

1003
00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:24.209
and you can only get it by thinking for

1004
00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:27.600
yourself, doesn't that create some sort of obligation or

1005
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:29.689
duty for you to think for yourself to get

1006
00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:34.219
this, this good thing understanding? Uh And so I

1007
00:52:34.229 --> 00:52:35.989
wanna agree with part of the objection, which is

1008
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.409
that understanding is uh a good thing and it's

1009
00:52:39.419 --> 00:52:43.399
better, more valuable than knowledge even. Um And I

1010
00:52:43.409 --> 00:52:45.570
agree too that you can only get it by

1011
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.760
thinking for yourself. So there's this good thing and

1012
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.000
you can only get it by thinking for yourself

1013
00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.040
where I disagree is that I don't think that

1014
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.219
that generates some sort of requirement for you to

1015
00:52:57.229 --> 00:53:01.000
do it. So it's better, but I think it's

1016
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:03.929
good enough to just have knowledge so we can

1017
00:53:03.939 --> 00:53:07.379
get knowledge by deferring to other people. That's not

1018
00:53:07.389 --> 00:53:10.479
the best epistemic state that we can potentially achieve,

1019
00:53:10.959 --> 00:53:13.000
but it's good enough. And so there's not a

1020
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.699
requirement for us to go on and do more

1021
00:53:15.709 --> 00:53:18.719
to understand. Again, if you want to, if that's

1022
00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:21.600
something, if, if you want to understand the answer,

1023
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.590
then again, there's nothing wrong with thinking for yourself

1024
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.909
and trying to understand it. But if someone knows

1025
00:53:27.919 --> 00:53:30.679
the answer and says, I don't really care to

1026
00:53:30.689 --> 00:53:33.120
understand. I'm happy just knowing what the answer is,

1027
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:36.879
I think that's, that's perfectly fine, even though there's

1028
00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:39.040
a better thing out there. So it's in a

1029
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:41.199
way, it's like the response is like, is a

1030
00:53:41.209 --> 00:53:45.790
denying a kind of maximizing view where you have

1031
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.080
to go out and get the very best epistemic

1032
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.280
state that you can. I'm saying that some, some

1033
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.810
intellectual states are good enough, even though you could

1034
00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.310
do better in part, because I think you can

1035
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.389
always do better. You could always get more evidence.

1036
00:53:57.399 --> 00:54:00.330
You could always double check, triple check, quadruple check

1037
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.360
and constantly improve your epistemic state. But it's not

1038
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.709
necessary like you, you're not required to do that

1039
00:54:06.719 --> 00:54:09.020
at least once you've attained a certain, a certain

1040
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.439
level.

1041
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.879
Uh Also because uh I'm not sure if this

1042
00:54:12.889 --> 00:54:17.919
idea would necessarily apply here, but since human knowledge

1043
00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:23.060
is constantly evolving, and there's not really one end

1044
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.530
point where we can be sure that OK, this

1045
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:31.000
is the definitively correct knowledge. There's nothing else to

1046
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.360
learn about this issue. W whatever kind of issue

1047
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.840
we we are exploring. And if that's the case,

1048
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:42.090
then even the experts themselves, I mean, they never

1049
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:48.709
have 100% complete, uh, uh, uh, an 100% complete

1050
00:54:48.719 --> 00:54:53.629
understanding of what they're studying or what they are

1051
00:54:53.639 --> 00:54:55.320
experts in. Right.

1052
00:54:56.129 --> 00:54:58.330
Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, because, I

1053
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.590
mean, I think, you know, certainty is probably never

1054
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.830
there, uh, for us so maybe we can always

1055
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.709
be improving and getting closer. Um, YEAH, we're never

1056
00:55:07.719 --> 00:55:10.820
gonna max out, we're never ever gonna max maximize

1057
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.550
things along those lines. Yeah, I think that's possible.

1058
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:18.949
And so getting into the last objection and this

1059
00:55:18.959 --> 00:55:22.229
is one that we ended up already touching on

1060
00:55:22.239 --> 00:55:27.830
earlier, the intellectual virtue objection. So, but just to

1061
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:33.659
clarify what intellectual virtue would be really associated with

1062
00:55:33.949 --> 00:55:37.669
the thinking for yourself in this particular case.

1063
00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:40.439
Yeah. So the way I think about the objection

1064
00:55:40.449 --> 00:55:44.250
is that there um that we have a requirement

1065
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.409
to think for ourselves because we have a requirement

1066
00:55:47.419 --> 00:55:51.149
to develop our own intellectual character. And if you're

1067
00:55:51.159 --> 00:55:54.840
not doing thinking, then you're not gonna be developing

1068
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:58.979
your own intellectual character. So, I mean, some, some

1069
00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:04.290
intellectual virtues that seem particularly relevant, there are say

1070
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.360
intellectual perseverance. So, um that's been thought about in

1071
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:11.360
some different ways. But one way is that to

1072
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:15.100
have intellectual perseverance is to encounter obstacles in your

1073
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.699
inquiry and to be able to overcome them and

1074
00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:21.620
not, you know, not give up inquiry too easily.

1075
00:56:22.489 --> 00:56:26.080
And obviously, if you're not doing uh if you're

1076
00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:29.110
not inquiring, you're not, you're not gonna develop uh

1077
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.790
intellectual perseverance because you're just not even doing it

1078
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.870
just like, you know, you're not gonna develop uh

1079
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.989
endurance in terms of running if you never run,

1080
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.629
right, you, you, you gotta be doing it in

1081
00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:44.300
order to uh develop the those capacities. And so

1082
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.540
the objection says intellectual virtues are obviously uh a

1083
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:50.629
very valuable thing. You can only get them by

1084
00:56:50.639 --> 00:56:54.050
doing the intellectual work yourself by by thinking for

1085
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.939
yourself. And so there's a requirement um a requirement

1086
00:56:57.949 --> 00:57:01.679
to think for yourself. Um So a couple of

1087
00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:04.030
things that I want that I say about that

1088
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.330
objection, the first is um I do think that

1089
00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.350
there are, you know, so I don't want the

1090
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.870
book to, to come off as the idea, like,

1091
00:57:12.879 --> 00:57:15.229
don't think for yourself. I still think that there

1092
00:57:15.239 --> 00:57:18.850
are plenty of times um when you, when you

1093
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.780
should think for yourself. So we, we said briefly,

1094
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:25.330
like for many, you know, for many things, you

1095
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.879
can find other people that are better, better at

1096
00:57:27.889 --> 00:57:30.350
answering that question than you are. But for some

1097
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.500
things you're the best at answering them, right? So

1098
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.889
maybe things about your immediate environment or things about

1099
00:57:35.899 --> 00:57:38.969
your recent past, you're, you know, you are better

1100
00:57:38.979 --> 00:57:40.850
than anyone else that you know, of uh for

1101
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:44.909
answering those questions. And so I do think regarding

1102
00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:48.399
that regarding in situations like that thinking for yourself

1103
00:57:48.409 --> 00:57:50.010
is the right thing to do. There's no, there's

1104
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.290
no better route to answering your question. So even

1105
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.909
if you are deferring lots of times. There's still,

1106
00:57:55.919 --> 00:57:59.899
I think gonna be plenty of occasions where, you

1107
00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.389
know, if you take the full advice of the

1108
00:58:01.399 --> 00:58:03.260
book, you're still gonna be thinking for yourself. So

1109
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:06.860
you still have, I think ample opportunity to develop

1110
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:12.199
um those intellectual virtues. But the perhaps slightly more

1111
00:58:12.209 --> 00:58:16.540
uh radical response is to call for a kind

1112
00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:19.840
of shift in how we think about intellectual virtues.

1113
00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:22.800
So a lot of the traditional list of intellectual

1114
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:26.649
virtues, I think envisions us on like the front

1115
00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:28.639
lines of inquiry. And so I think it comes

1116
00:58:28.649 --> 00:58:32.429
from this kind of individualistic paradigm that we talked

1117
00:58:32.439 --> 00:58:35.330
about earlier where you're on the front lines of

1118
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.429
inquiry, you're engaged in it, you have to find

1119
00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:42.100
the answers. Whereas now with the within a social

1120
00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:46.070
epistemology perspective, we recognize that it's, you know, we

1121
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.389
have this interdependent web of people that we can

1122
00:58:49.399 --> 00:58:52.899
rely on. And so I think from within the

1123
00:58:52.909 --> 00:58:56.030
social perspective, the kinds of things that we should

1124
00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:00.879
see as intellectual virtues is gonna shift, right? So

1125
00:59:00.889 --> 00:59:03.929
the the the parallel would be, you know, if

1126
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:08.199
we imagine an individual sport, athlete versus a team,

1127
00:59:08.209 --> 00:59:11.879
sport athlete, the kind of characteristics you want for

1128
00:59:11.889 --> 00:59:14.820
each is gonna differ, right? Because if, if it's

1129
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:16.550
just the one person, then there's a certain set

1130
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.540
of characteristics you want them to have. But if

1131
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.120
they have a certain role on a team, then

1132
00:59:21.129 --> 00:59:23.399
there's different characteristics that are gonna be relevant for

1133
00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:26.429
making things to go. Well, so I think it's

1134
00:59:26.439 --> 00:59:28.820
gonna depend. And so I think in our sort

1135
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.020
of information economy, we can think about there being,

1136
00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:38.419
you know, knowledge producers, knowledge disseminator and knowledge uh

1137
00:59:38.429 --> 00:59:42.600
consumers. And for most of us, we're consumers, right?

1138
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:45.800
We're not on the front lines of inquiry for

1139
00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.659
most things, maybe for some things, but for most

1140
00:59:47.669 --> 00:59:50.149
things, we're not on the front lines answering those

1141
00:59:50.159 --> 00:59:54.050
questions. And we're not primarily involved in like disseminating

1142
00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.110
the answers from the people on the front lines.

1143
00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:01.360
So we're mostly in the information consuming business. And

1144
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:04.959
I think what sort of characteristics and intellectual character

1145
01:00:04.969 --> 01:00:09.169
traits we should have to be good information consumers

1146
01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:12.620
is different than what the traditional list has, which

1147
01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:14.489
has us on the front line. So, you know,

1148
01:00:14.919 --> 01:00:17.149
they're gonna be things that are being discerning in

1149
01:00:17.159 --> 01:00:19.620
terms of like which voices you're listening to and

1150
01:00:19.629 --> 01:00:23.550
what information, um you're getting your sources from, they're

1151
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.439
gonna be virtues of attention, what sort of questions

1152
01:00:26.449 --> 01:00:29.300
you're paying attention to, what kind of things um

1153
01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.949
you're ignoring. And so I, I do think that

1154
01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:35.469
our list of virtues might need some updating to

1155
01:00:35.479 --> 01:00:38.419
the towards this social picture. But once we do

1156
01:00:38.429 --> 01:00:41.800
that, then it's gonna be perfectly compatible with the

1157
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:45.370
idea of deferring to other people quite often that

1158
01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:47.780
you still have intellectual virtue that you still have

1159
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:51.110
a good intellectual character. Again, relative to the kind

1160
01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.429
of role that you have in the in the

1161
01:00:53.439 --> 01:00:54.879
informational picture.

1162
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.949
And so when it comes to something that we've

1163
01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:02.679
already talked about here, that is being able to

1164
01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:07.989
really recognize uh the specific areas and subjects where

1165
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.800
you lack knowledge and you should differ to experts,

1166
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.040
for example, and being able to properly recognize the

1167
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:19.629
experts. What kind of intellectual virtue is that? Is

1168
01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:22.830
that intellectual humility? Yeah.

1169
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.830
Well, I think it's a lot. So the two

1170
01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.439
that jump out to me are intellectual humility and

1171
01:01:27.449 --> 01:01:31.810
epistemic autonomy. So humility in terms of thinking of

1172
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:35.620
knowing your own intellectual limitations, right? So, you know,

1173
01:01:36.054 --> 01:01:37.604
you know what you can do what you're good

1174
01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:39.725
at and you also know what you can't do

1175
01:01:39.735 --> 01:01:42.004
and what you're not good at. And so that's

1176
01:01:42.014 --> 01:01:44.915
gonna be incredibly important, I think in trying to

1177
01:01:44.925 --> 01:01:47.985
help determine what you should think about for yourself

1178
01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:50.364
and what you should defer to others, right? So

1179
01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:53.354
it's important for me to understand that if I

1180
01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:57.034
look at the climate science data, I'm probably not

1181
01:01:57.044 --> 01:01:59.445
going to be able to understand it in any

1182
01:01:59.455 --> 01:02:02.500
sort of meaningful way on my own, right? That's

1183
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.000
like just a little bit of humility uh that

1184
01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:08.870
I have um but also epistemic autonomy as we

1185
01:02:08.879 --> 01:02:11.300
talked about it as a virtue was this good

1186
01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:15.419
executive management of your intellectual life. And so making

1187
01:02:15.429 --> 01:02:19.159
those determinations. Well, so I think those two virtues

1188
01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.110
kind of go hand in hand, right? The the

1189
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.280
in order to make good decisions about how to

1190
01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.879
go about your inquiry. You're gonna have to have

1191
01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:28.909
intellectual humility, right? You can't be, you can't have

1192
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:32.399
an overly inflated view about you and your abilities

1193
01:02:32.409 --> 01:02:34.879
or you're gonna make some bad decisions. Um, BUT

1194
01:02:34.889 --> 01:02:38.340
you also shouldn't have an overly underestimated view of

1195
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:41.520
your abilities or you're gonna be uh deferring on

1196
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.989
things that you are perfectly capable of, of figuring

1197
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.909
out yourself. Right. So, you know, if I'm, if,

1198
01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:49.209
if I can perfectly find, if I it's easy

1199
01:02:49.219 --> 01:02:50.370
for me to find out the answer yet, I'm

1200
01:02:50.379 --> 01:02:53.040
always like calling up my wife to like you,

1201
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.590
you, you do this for, you figure it out,

1202
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.899
then there's something that's gone wrong. Uh There's something

1203
01:02:56.909 --> 01:02:59.699
that's gone wrong there uh as well. So I

1204
01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:02.719
think intellectual humility and epistemic autonomy, I think are

1205
01:03:02.729 --> 01:03:04.409
the two that really kind of shine out in

1206
01:03:04.419 --> 01:03:08.540
terms of like being able to make good decisions

1207
01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:11.290
and figuring out when to think for yourself, when

1208
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.090
to rely on others and uh making good determinations

1209
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:15.429
there.

1210
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.000
And when it comes to intellectual virtues, isn't it

1211
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:24.040
sort of an intellectual vice, let's say, for people

1212
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:29.469
to convince themselves that they uh can always just

1213
01:03:29.479 --> 01:03:32.330
think for themselves and not rely on others at

1214
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.949
all? I mean, isn't that uh some uh a

1215
01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:39.360
kind of arrogance and also to some extent, delusional?

1216
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.909
Yeah. Right. No. Uh Yeah, I would put it

1217
01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.879
as intellectual arrogance because you're not, uh you're, you're

1218
01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:50.090
definitely not recognizing your limitations, you're not rec, and

1219
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.709
you're also not recognizing. Um, SO there's something you're

1220
01:03:53.719 --> 01:03:56.659
getting wrong about yourself. You're over here inflating your

1221
01:03:56.669 --> 01:03:59.939
own abilities. Um, BUT you're also getting something wrong

1222
01:03:59.949 --> 01:04:04.040
with other people. Right. You're, you're unnecessarily downgrading them

1223
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.290
because you're thinking, oh, they're no better off at

1224
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.030
doing that, uh, than I am. That's making an

1225
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.370
error on both fronts. Right. You're thinking of yourself

1226
01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.469
higher than you should, but you're also thinking of

1227
01:04:13.479 --> 01:04:16.429
them as the experts more, you know, more lowly

1228
01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:18.679
than you should because they do have expertise, they

1229
01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.899
do have evidence that you don't have, they do

1230
01:04:20.909 --> 01:04:22.419
have skills that you don't have. And so you

1231
01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:26.949
need to, to properly appreciate that uh in order

1232
01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:28.870
to make good decisions. So the, yeah, the arrogant,

1233
01:04:28.879 --> 01:04:32.199
the arrogant person is gonna mis evaluate those judgments,

1234
01:04:32.209 --> 01:04:35.090
they're gonna mis evaluate themselves, they're gonna overly inflate

1235
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.479
their own and they're gonna, I think mis evaluate

1236
01:04:37.489 --> 01:04:39.909
other people by downgrading them unnecessarily.

1237
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.989
Do you think that the thesis you present in

1238
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.169
your book would connect in any way to ideas

1239
01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:53.000
surrounding epistemic responsibility? And if so for example, in

1240
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:57.060
an earlier question, you answer, you mentioned that uh

1241
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:00.729
there are, when it comes to knowledge, there are

1242
01:05:00.739 --> 01:05:05.699
producers disseminator and consumers. So if that's the case,

1243
01:05:05.709 --> 01:05:07.929
do you think that perhaps there would be different

1244
01:05:07.939 --> 01:05:13.879
sets of epistemic responsibilities depending on your role there?

1245
01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:22.290
Yeah, good. Uh Yeah, I think that's right. So,

1246
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.050
I mean, I do. So this is one thing

1247
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.530
that comes to mind when you ask that question

1248
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:30.540
is, you know, for instance, I do think that

1249
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:35.110
experts have a responsibility to think for themselves. So,

1250
01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.850
uh if so take, you know, for instance, if

1251
01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:42.360
you found out that, um you know, the climate

1252
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:46.719
scientists all agreed only because one person, there's one

1253
01:05:46.729 --> 01:05:48.760
person who thought climate change was happening and the

1254
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.939
rest of the climate scientists all just believe that

1255
01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:53.560
because that one person did, even if, even if,

1256
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:56.610
even if they were like the the best, um

1257
01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.439
it would be a real disservice to, to us

1258
01:05:59.449 --> 01:06:02.000
if like they all just believed it because this

1259
01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:04.870
one person did. So what gives us as a

1260
01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:08.479
broader society, this good intellectual resource is that we

1261
01:06:08.489 --> 01:06:13.989
have expert communities where the experts in that community

1262
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.260
are thinking for themselves, they are independently assessing the

1263
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:21.409
evidence, making their own determinations about what it supports.

1264
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.669
And by doing that, even even if it gives

1265
01:06:24.679 --> 01:06:27.929
rise to some disagreements and some agreements, it provides

1266
01:06:27.939 --> 01:06:31.479
us with a much more valuable intellectual resource. So

1267
01:06:31.729 --> 01:06:34.879
as experts, I think experts def have a different

1268
01:06:34.889 --> 01:06:38.060
responsibility that they would be doing something wrong if

1269
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:40.520
they just, you know, found their colleague who they

1270
01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:42.139
thought was a little bit better than they were

1271
01:06:42.149 --> 01:06:43.949
and then just believe whatever they believe so that

1272
01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.510
would be doing um that would be doing uh

1273
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.060
us AAA disservice. So I think that there is

1274
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:52.800
a particular responsibility for experts and we can think

1275
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.560
about them as the uh the knowledge producers, like

1276
01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:57.590
the people who are on tho tho those front

1277
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.280
lines uh of inquiry. And then sure, I mean,

1278
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:03.860
I think that there, if we think about those

1279
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.520
different roles that I laid out, like the knowledge

1280
01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.969
uh disseminator, like, what kind of responsibilities do they

1281
01:07:10.979 --> 01:07:14.620
have? Well, there's things having to do with um

1282
01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.989
making sure they get it right. They get the

1283
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.979
answers right that they're conveying, being able to convey

1284
01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:25.750
um those, those answers in a way that's um

1285
01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.090
digestible to the, to the broader public. You know,

1286
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.060
if, if they're not doing that, if they're making

1287
01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:36.590
things misleading or unnecessarily convoluted, they're, they're doing something

1288
01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:41.939
um problematic. And then yeah, as consumers too, we

1289
01:07:41.949 --> 01:07:45.709
can think about different responsibilities that we may have.

1290
01:07:45.719 --> 01:07:50.370
Maybe it's responsibilities to um pay attention to certain

1291
01:07:50.379 --> 01:07:54.929
types of questions. Maybe it's responsibilities to be evaluating

1292
01:07:54.939 --> 01:07:59.389
different sources um correctly and not, and not overly

1293
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:03.620
inflating uh some or over inflating our own uh

1294
01:08:03.629 --> 01:08:06.679
our own abilities. So, I mean, I think epistemic

1295
01:08:06.689 --> 01:08:12.010
responsibility is a, is a, is a, is a

1296
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.000
big umbrella that a lot of things uh a

1297
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:17.759
lot of things um can fall under. And so

1298
01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:22.080
I, I definitely don't, don't think or don't want

1299
01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:23.689
anything that I say in the book to kind

1300
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.680
of like conflict or say, oh, there's nothing, it's

1301
01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:29.749
all just um it's all just anything goes, I

1302
01:08:29.758 --> 01:08:31.917
guess we could think about the thesis in terms

1303
01:08:31.929 --> 01:08:35.269
of responsibility as just saying this, what we, what

1304
01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.698
I think you don't have is a kind of

1305
01:08:37.707 --> 01:08:41.389
epistemic responsibility to be thinking about your, to be

1306
01:08:41.398 --> 01:08:44.219
thinking for yourself about all these issues, right? That

1307
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:47.479
when you, when you can identify, um, someone who

1308
01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:50.059
is better, uh, at answer than you are, that's

1309
01:08:50.068 --> 01:08:53.667
perfectly fine. You're not violating any responsibility by, by

1310
01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:54.889
taking their word for it

1311
01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:58.709
and by the way related to those different kinds

1312
01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.049
of roles that people can play, I guess that

1313
01:09:02.379 --> 01:09:06.629
they also wouldn't be mu mutually exclusive, right? Because

1314
01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.799
there are people that are both, for example, producers

1315
01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:14.899
and disseminator, like for example, some university professors that

1316
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.629
are also science communicators and then even the consumers

1317
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.609
themselves, I mean, it's rarely the case that people

1318
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.680
are only just exclusively consumers that they keep the,

1319
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:30.629
the knowledge just to themselves and not tell about

1320
01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.129
it to other people.

1321
01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.419
Right. Yeah. Well, and you're certainly not a producer

1322
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.700
across the board either because like, as we talked

1323
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:39.390
to a special at most, you have one narrow

1324
01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:43.109
field where you're finding the answers, right? So assuming

1325
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.629
that you have beliefs about a lot of other

1326
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.790
things which, you know, we, we, we should, we

1327
01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:49.109
probably do, then you're gonna be, you're gonna be

1328
01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.839
a consumer but a lot of things, even if

1329
01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:53.089
you are a producer about some things and a

1330
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.740
disseminator but other things. So, yeah, I do. Yeah.

1331
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.509
Uh So you're right that we shouldn't think of

1332
01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.500
these roles as being mutually exclusive that they can,

1333
01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:02.060
they can combine in all kinds of ways as

1334
01:10:02.069 --> 01:10:02.379
well.

1335
01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.529
So I have one last question then and basically

1336
01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:11.919
to try to reverse the thesis that you explore

1337
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:14.930
in the book. Are there specific cases? And I

1338
01:10:14.939 --> 01:10:17.700
guess you've already given us at least one example

1339
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:20.759
of that? But are there specific cases where you

1340
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:25.060
think it is actually not? OK to not think

1341
01:10:25.069 --> 01:10:26.359
for yourself?

1342
01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:32.000
Yeah. So, yeah, II, I do. Um, SO two,

1343
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:36.240
I guess two cases, one more generally is just

1344
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.149
when you're, when you're an expert. So if you're

1345
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.879
in, you know, as a, as a philosopher or

1346
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.750
at least as an epistemology, I take it that

1347
01:10:44.759 --> 01:10:47.859
I have a responsibility to be thinking for myself

1348
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:51.470
about uh these different issues in epistemology that, you

1349
01:10:51.479 --> 01:10:54.310
know, it's, it'd be doing no good to the

1350
01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:56.410
rest of the world for me just to be

1351
01:10:56.689 --> 01:11:00.240
disseminating the beliefs that I've just uh got by

1352
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.979
deference to people, to epistemology who are, who are,

1353
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:05.089
who are better at it, um, than I am.

1354
01:11:05.779 --> 01:11:07.680
And so I think to just, you know, for

1355
01:11:07.689 --> 01:11:12.069
everyone on an individual level, there are questions that

1356
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.549
um for each of us that we are as

1357
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.759
good at answering as anyone else's, I mean, I

1358
01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:20.470
think we tend to exaggerate how many of those

1359
01:11:20.479 --> 01:11:23.149
there are but there are some and so I

1360
01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.509
think when, when you are the best at answering

1361
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.750
that question, there would be something problematic with you

1362
01:11:29.759 --> 01:11:31.919
not doing that inquiry yourself again, maybe there are

1363
01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:34.430
other sort of considerations that can come in and,

1364
01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:36.740
and Trump that, but in general, there would be

1365
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.629
a problem. So the way I think about going

1366
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.520
back to the, you know, the house analogy is

1367
01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:45.000
uh you know, there's all kinds of house projects

1368
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.169
that there are people who are better than me

1369
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.810
at, at, at completing. Um And so I think

1370
01:11:49.819 --> 01:11:52.899
there's nothing wrong with me relying on them to

1371
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:56.029
complete those house projects for me. But there's some

1372
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.979
that I'm like as good as anyone else as

1373
01:11:57.990 --> 01:12:01.120
like taking out the trash and like changing easy

1374
01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:03.439
to reach light bulbs. Like I like that's the

1375
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:06.359
limit of my skill, but like regarding those tasks,

1376
01:12:06.509 --> 01:12:08.310
I can do them with the best, right? So

1377
01:12:08.319 --> 01:12:10.500
I can change an easy to reach light bulb

1378
01:12:10.509 --> 01:12:13.509
as good as anyone else can. And so, you

1379
01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.620
know, maybe there would be something problematic if you

1380
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:18.410
know, in, in those cases, I just refuse to

1381
01:12:18.419 --> 01:12:21.500
do that um do that work. And so the

1382
01:12:21.509 --> 01:12:24.279
parallel would be like if there are answers that

1383
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.180
are easy enough for me to find and that

1384
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:29.839
it's, there's no one significantly better than I am

1385
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:34.350
to answer those questions. My like not inquiring on

1386
01:12:34.359 --> 01:12:36.120
my own, my not thinking for myself about it,

1387
01:12:36.129 --> 01:12:39.419
but instead relying on someone else might reveal some

1388
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:42.379
sort of deficiency or some sort of character vice

1389
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:46.069
on my part. So I, yeah, I do think

1390
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.069
there are some cases and again, I don't want

1391
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.069
to, I don't want to say anything about it

1392
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.020
ever being wrong to think for yourself. So I

1393
01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:55.330
wanna, you know, encourage it and think it's perfectly

1394
01:12:55.339 --> 01:12:59.350
fine to do that. It's just, uh, what I

1395
01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:01.720
wanna do is remove the responsibility to always be

1396
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:03.649
doing it right. So, it's, it's ok not to

1397
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.729
regarding this, this wide variety of questions.

1398
01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:10.790
So the book is again, why it's ok not

1399
01:13:10.799 --> 01:13:13.950
to think for yourself. I'm leaving a link with

1400
01:13:13.959 --> 01:13:17.419
the description box of the interview and Doctor Mason

1401
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.589
just before we go apart from the book, would

1402
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.850
you like to tell people where they can find

1403
01:13:22.859 --> 01:13:24.990
you and your work on the internet?

1404
01:13:26.259 --> 01:13:29.750
Yeah. So uh I have uh a, a web

1405
01:13:29.759 --> 01:13:31.879
page or you can find me on fill papers.

1406
01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.450
I have a page on Phil papers. You can

01:13:33.459 --> 01:13:36.240

1408
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.359
happy to hear people's thoughts if they pick up

1409
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.649
