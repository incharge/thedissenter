00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.039
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.860
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:08.710
joined by Doctor Bella De Palo. She is the

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.390
leading expert on single life. She actually coined the

5
00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.479
term single at heart. And today we're going to

6
00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.129
talk exactly about that because we are focusing on

7
00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:21.559
her latest book, Single At Heart, The Power of

8
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:24.930
Freedom and Heart Feeling Joy of Single life. So

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.940
Doctor De Palo, welcome to the show. It's a

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.000
pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.770
Thank you so much for having me.

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.110
So let me start by asking you this. We're

13
00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:37.240
going to talk about who these single at heart

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.490
people are. But first of all is your book

15
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.360
uh about people who are just temporarily single, single

16
00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.389
for life both and the, it's, it's about them

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.000
and also for them. I mean, what exactly is

18
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.580
going on

19
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.419
here? Ok. So the book is about people who

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.169
are single at heart and they are people who

21
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.269
love being single and want to stay single for

22
00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:09.059
them. And I'm one of them. Single life is

23
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.690
our best life. So it's our most meaningful, fulfilling,

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.205
authentic, the joyful and psychologically rich life. People who

25
00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:23.175
are single at heart are s are happy and

26
00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:28.504
flourishing because they're single, not in spite of it.

27
00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:33.389
So, the book is mostly about them, but lots

28
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.440
of people don't realize that single life is their

29
00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:43.250
best life until they've tried several romantic relationships, maybe

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.639
even several marriages and realize that even if they

31
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.510
are in a relationship with someone they love and

32
00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:54.910
who loves them back, it just doesn't feel right.

33
00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:58.949
And so, um, you know, they might have spent

34
00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.819
a lot of their lives not being single and

35
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.540
the book is for them and it is also

36
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.210
even for people who are single and maybe don't

37
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.770
wanna stay single. But they're curious about what it's

38
00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.410
like to flourish when single or it's also for

39
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.940
the parents and maybe even some friends and family

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.100
of single people who have this single person in

41
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.190
their life, you know, their son or daughter, if

42
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:37.119
it's parents or relative or friend who doesn't seem

43
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.889
like they wanna get married or even be in

44
00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.339
a romantic relationship and maybe they're really worried about

45
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.399
them and if they read this book they might

46
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.220
realize maybe there's nothing to be worried about, maybe

47
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.619
they're living a great life.

48
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.270
Yeah. That's the thing. That's, uh, the reason why

49
00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.410
I asked you if this book is also for

50
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.839
people who are temporarily single but not necessarily single

51
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.070
at heart or don't want to be single for

52
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.250
the rest of their lives because a and we're

53
00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.470
going to get more into this point. But I

54
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.850
guess that it's safe to say that one of

55
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.119
the points you want to drive home with your

56
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.830
book is that even if you are temporarily single

57
00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:25.184
and want to look for another relationship, it's not

58
00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:28.164
the end of the world. If you are single

59
00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:30.854
for a few months, even a few years, because

60
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:34.335
there's many things that, uh, that are valuable that

61
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.845
you can do with your life and that happens

62
00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:39.845
to a ton of people.

63
00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:44.804
Yes, for sure. In fact, it's best not to

64
00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.865
think of it as, oh, poor me. I'm single.

65
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.929
But oh, let me think about the opportunities I

66
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.380
have here to do things I like to do.

67
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.210
Maybe, especially things I might not do. Once I

68
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.020
find my romantic partner, it's an opportunity to spend

69
00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.960
as much time with your friends or anyone else

70
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.839
that you like being with or are caring for

71
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.080
without worrying that some romantic partner thinks that more

72
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.000
of that time belongs to them. So it is

73
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.260
a great opportunity,

74
00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:22.079
by the way, do single at heart. People also

75
00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:27.428
include people who are actually never actively looking for

76
00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:31.699
a new partner, but they just never completely close

77
00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.338
themselves to the possibility of falling in love with

78
00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:37.218
someone if that happens.

79
00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:41.690
You know, I think that people you are describing

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.640
now are what Sasha Kagan calls quirky alone, which

81
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:51.739
is that they truly appreciate their single lives, but

82
00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.799
they're open to someone who meets their very high

83
00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.359
standards so they're not gonna be in a romantic

84
00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.980
relationship just to be in a romantic relationship. But

85
00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:04.940
they are interested.

86
00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.320
And I mean, do we have any idea at

87
00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:14.089
all about how many single at heart people are

88
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.950
out there? I mean, do we have good statistics

89
00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:17.440
on that?

90
00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:24.170
Um It's really hard to tell because it's not

91
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:28.679
a concept that's out there. So m most people

92
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.679
don't have never heard of this. They don't realize

93
00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:35.470
that there's such a thing as loving, being single

94
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.359
and wanting to stay single. But I can give

95
00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:45.140
you some estimates. Um I have an online quiz

96
00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.100
called Are You Single at Heart. It's also in

97
00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:50.730
the book and more than 20,000 people from 100

98
00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.630
nations, more than 100 nations have taken it. And

99
00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.480
um 29% of them identify as clearly single at

100
00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:05.329
heart, but it's not a representative sample. It's just

101
00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.429
people who find out about the quiz and take

102
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.529
it. So another estimate comes from um a study

103
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.529
of thousands of German adults who are solo single.

104
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.429
So they don't have a romantic partner, they're not

105
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.970
married, they're not cohabiting. And of those 21% say

106
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.329
they're, they don't want a romantic partner. So I

107
00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.250
think, you know, that the numbers are gonna be

108
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.010
substantial, but we won't really know what they are

109
00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:46.239
until the idea becomes more widely known. And people

110
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.769
realize that this wanting to stay single for positive

111
00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.890
reasons because you appreciate all that single life has

112
00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.934
to offer is a really good thing. And once

113
00:06:59.945 --> 00:07:03.234
that way of thinking about it gets out there,

114
00:07:03.244 --> 00:07:07.494
then more people will understand themselves that way and

115
00:07:07.505 --> 00:07:12.714
they won't feel as many do now that they

116
00:07:12.725 --> 00:07:16.125
can't really admit that they love being single and

117
00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.394
want to stay single because people think there's something

118
00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:20.954
wrong with you. If that's how you feel,

119
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.049
by the way, uh, you mentioned the quiz you

120
00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:28.339
have in your book. How can one find out

121
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.579
that they are single at heart?

122
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.459
Oh, you can take the quiz and um there's

123
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.940
a answer key at the end of it. So

124
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.980
you can either find it in my book or

125
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:44.019
online. Another thing is even better is to read

126
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:48.459
my single at heart book and see how much

127
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.109
you identify with the stories of people who are

128
00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:54.179
single at heart

129
00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:59.989
and what are, what tend to be the psychological

130
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.790
traits of people who are single at heart. Do

131
00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:07.459
they have particular psychological traits or?

132
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.809
Yeah, you know, people who are single at heart

133
00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:17.299
really care about authenticity. So they want to be

134
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:20.320
their true selves. They want to live a life

135
00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:24.059
that reflects who they really are rather than just

136
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.000
doing what they're expected to do what everyone thinks

137
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.320
you should do. And with that comes a certain

138
00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:34.840
level of confidence because to go against the grain,

139
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.590
you know, you do need to have some confidence

140
00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:42.640
in yourself there are also studies showing that people

141
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.320
who enjoy spending time alone, which the single at

142
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.830
heart do um are more open to experiences, they're

143
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.820
less likely to be neurotic. So it's a very

144
00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:59.750
positive psychological profile.

145
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.030
A actually about that. I, I wanted to ask

146
00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:06.659
you because since we have a and we're going

147
00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:08.969
to talk a little bit more about that later

148
00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:12.140
in our conversation. But since we have this sort

149
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:17.809
of uh norm across virtually all societies that tells

150
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.159
us that people should want to be coupled, should

151
00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:23.169
want to have a partner, should want to have

152
00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:26.719
a romantic relationship, be married and so on. It's

153
00:09:26.729 --> 00:09:31.934
very easy for us to pathologize people just say

154
00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:34.275
that they don't want any of that. They are

155
00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:36.895
not interested in that. And for example, I would

156
00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:42.974
imagine that many even clinical psychologists would say that

157
00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:47.145
for example, some someone who claims that has, for

158
00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:51.114
example, an avoidant attachment style or something like that.

159
00:09:51.705 --> 00:09:55.455
But I mean that that perhaps is not necessarily

160
00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:59.734
the case, right? Probably there's nothing psychologically wrong with

161
00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:00.164
them.

162
00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:07.030
Yeah. In fact, they may be pictures of psychological

163
00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:12.469
health because they have the confidence to live their

164
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.969
best life rather than just following the crowd. Um

165
00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:22.179
You know, they're of single people who are avoidant

166
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.880
attached. I think they are more likely to be

167
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.950
the single people who don't want to be single.

168
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.950
So the single at harsh are not people who

169
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.359
are running away from romantic relationships because they don't

170
00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:42.789
like them or they've been burned or, you know,

171
00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:47.030
they have issues. They are people who are drawn

172
00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:51.630
to single life in very positive ways because they

173
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.710
like the freedom it offers them, they like the

174
00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:59.869
opportunity to be themselves. They like the, the opportunity

175
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.330
to spend time alone and to value all different

176
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:08.969
kinds of people rather than just putting one person,

177
00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:12.299
a romantic partner, the center of your life

178
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.500
and is being single at heart. Something that is

179
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.030
in any way innate or is it something that

180
00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:23.969
people develop? Do we have any idea about that?

181
00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:29.270
Yeah. There's no really good research on that yet.

182
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.590
But my impression from all the work I've done

183
00:11:33.989 --> 00:11:38.390
and the interviews and so forth is that being

184
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.669
single at heart is something more than a lifestyle.

185
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.250
So, people who are single at heart are powerfully

186
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:53.010
drawn this single life, that's what really feels comfortable,

187
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.659
authentic and true. So, whether it's innate, I don't

188
00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:00.739
know if I can go that extra step, but

189
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.400
it's certainly more than just. Oh, I think I'll

190
00:12:03.409 --> 00:12:04.609
be single for a while.

191
00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:09.239
So it's probably, if not innate, at least the,

192
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.340
there's a strong psychological predisposition for that.

193
00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:15.549
Yes. Yeah. That's a good way to put it.

194
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.789
Uh, AND are there any gender differences here? I

195
00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:23.109
mean, is it more common among men than women

196
00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.460
or vice versa?

197
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.929
Yes. This is surprising to a lot of people

198
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.679
including myself. Um, YOU know, generally, if you look

199
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.200
at single people in general, women usually do better

200
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.210
at being single, they're better at cultivating friendships and

201
00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:41.770
they know how to do all the household chores

202
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.000
and, and all that. So they're good at it.

203
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.400
But when you look at this so upset of

204
00:12:49.409 --> 00:12:51.919
single people, the ones who are single at heart,

205
00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:56.059
who love being single and are powerfully drawn to

206
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.359
that life. There are a little few more men

207
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:03.820
than women. I mean, there are substantial numbers of

208
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.429
men and women but that it actually helps a

209
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.059
little towards more for the men. And when you

210
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.580
think about being single heart at heart, you know,

211
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.000
like it's people who like their freedom, they like

212
00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:18.809
um getting to be the deciders, uh they like,

213
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.150
you know, it makes sense in a way but

214
00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:23.780
it wasn't something I anticipated

215
00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:28.760
and what kinds of opportunities the single hood offer

216
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.239
people.

217
00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:36.150
Yeah. You know, the main thing is to um

218
00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:44.010
follow your heart and yet to do whatever it

219
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.830
is, you know, within the limits of your resources

220
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.150
and opportunities that you find fulfilling and that might

221
00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:55.609
mean pursuing opportunities to learn and grow, like pursuing

222
00:13:55.619 --> 00:14:00.489
your education or unique experiences or travel. It could

223
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.450
mean for some people, it means um be there

224
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.809
for the people who need you. It could include

225
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.669
being there for your communities and your nation. It

226
00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:18.830
could be um creating your own path through life.

227
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.859
So rather than the standard, you know, I'm gonna

228
00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:23.809
meet someone and move in and get married and

229
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.770
have kids. You create your own life path. It

230
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.140
could mean, um, this surprised me a little bit

231
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:36.929
too, choosing meaningful work rather than work that pays

232
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.510
a lot. If you can't have both. Now you

233
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.210
can't do that the whole time and you have

234
00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:43.729
to pay your bills and, you know, as a

235
00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:46.919
single person, you don't have a spouse or, you

236
00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:51.750
know, partner to, um, we have financial backstop. So

237
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.950
you got to do something. But beyond that single

238
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.429
people like or single at heart, people like doing

239
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:04.359
meaningful work. Um, IT might mean reimagining um holidays

240
00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.669
so that you spend them in unique ways that

241
00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:11.799
are uh special to you. There's just, uh the

242
00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:17.270
big picture is you live your life in accordance

243
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:23.559
with your interests and values and passions without being

244
00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:30.599
bandied about by the wishes or needs or interests

245
00:15:30.609 --> 00:15:34.270
of a partner. Now, I'm, and I'm saying that

246
00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:37.640
you can have a partner who's not at all

247
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.140
controlling and still what they like to do, what

248
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.859
they like to eat, what, where they like to

249
00:15:43.869 --> 00:15:49.789
go, that kind of influences you. Um And I

250
00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:56.619
think really interesting example of that happens when people

251
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.070
are married for a long time and then they

252
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.909
are divorced or widowed and at first that can

253
00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:09.380
be a really crushing experience. But over time, some

254
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:15.380
people find that single life is really fulfilling and

255
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.039
they start to learn things about themselves and it's

256
00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:24.679
almost like coming home to themselves.

257
00:16:26.229 --> 00:16:30.500
You know, one particular thing that really bothers me,

258
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:35.609
uh, hearing people, I mean, sometimes reacting to when

259
00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:39.150
they hear certain people that are single saying that

260
00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:42.020
they don't want a partner because they just want

261
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.369
to wake up in the weekend, whatever time they

262
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.590
want to go to bed, whatever time they want

263
00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:52.359
to do whatever they want without having to, uh,

264
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.650
tell anything to anybody. I mean, they just organize

265
00:16:56.659 --> 00:16:59.400
their day the way they want. Sometimes people react

266
00:16:59.409 --> 00:17:02.039
to that and say, oh, you just want to

267
00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:06.449
avoid respon. But I, I mean, that doesn't make

268
00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:11.310
much sense. Right. Because actually you're even more responsible

269
00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.618
for your own life because you have to decide

270
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.939
on your own what to do when to do.

271
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:21.209
And I, I mean, if something bad happens you

272
00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:24.900
have no one to,, complain to, I mean, no

273
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.030
one to, to, to,, to say there, uh, I

274
00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.739
mean, it's their fault. It's your own fault in

275
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.520
a sense.

276
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.630
Right. Yeah. Um, I wouldn't say they don't have

277
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.780
anyone because often they have more friends, more different

278
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.739
people in their lives. But I, but I see

279
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.599
what your, what your point is there. Yeah. I

280
00:17:44.609 --> 00:17:49.099
mean, they are, you know, they're in charge of

281
00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:51.199
their own life. So, the, the good part about

282
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:52.869
that is they get to decide and do what

283
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.849
they want and have a life they want. But

284
00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:57.569
the, the downside is that they have to cover

285
00:17:57.579 --> 00:17:59.920
everything. Right. So they've got to pay all their

286
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.750
own bills and, you know, do their, do all

287
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.160
the chores that a couple might, might split up

288
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:10.040
between them and, and so there's that, but even

289
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.280
that the thing about all the different chores and,

290
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.910
you know, who takes care of the finances and

291
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.260
who takes care of the car and who does

292
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.969
the dishes and who does the laundry, even all

293
00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:29.500
of that. It can be a positive in the

294
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.660
long run for people who stay single because they

295
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.300
either learn how to do all those things themselves

296
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.060
or they figure out how to find someone to

297
00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:45.770
help or to hire. And what that means is

298
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.099
when they get to later life. And some people

299
00:18:49.109 --> 00:18:53.300
who were married or, um, had a close romantic

300
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.719
live in relationship when that ends by divorce or

301
00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:03.250
widowhood, they either don't know how to do the

302
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.239
things their partner used to do where they're out

303
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.219
of practice. And at a time that can already

304
00:19:10.229 --> 00:19:16.180
be very difficult. Putting on top of that, having

305
00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:20.410
to learn or relearn how to do these tasks

306
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.479
of everyday life can make it even harder. And

307
00:19:24.489 --> 00:19:27.369
meanwhile, the single people have been single, all their

308
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.530
lives are just, you know, going around, going along,

309
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.969
doing what they've learned to do a long time

310
00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:34.359
ago.

311
00:19:35.489 --> 00:19:38.930
So I, I guess that one very common question

312
00:19:38.939 --> 00:19:41.790
or thing that people would worry about when it

313
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.060
comes to single hood is uh solitude. So, is

314
00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:50.319
that something that single at heart? People experience a

315
00:19:50.329 --> 00:19:54.270
lot. And if so how do they deal with

316
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:54.510
it?

317
00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:59.510
Yes, this is something else that surprised me. So

318
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.979
I really enjoy the time. I have to myself,

319
00:20:03.989 --> 00:20:07.079
I craved it. I, I would not be a

320
00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:09.660
happy person if I had to be around people

321
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.750
all the time. Although I like being with other

322
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.609
people, just not all the time. And so I

323
00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:18.380
figured once I did my research, I'd find that

324
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.589
people who are single at heart, so kind of

325
00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:25.290
like their solitude. What I did not anticipate is

326
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.689
that of the people who told me their life

327
00:20:27.699 --> 00:20:33.119
stories. Every one of them said that they loved

328
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.829
having time to themselves. The people said it was

329
00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:41.180
like breathing. And so that was something that was

330
00:20:41.189 --> 00:20:47.810
surprising. And that is another strength of people who

331
00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:49.900
are single at heart. I actually think of it

332
00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:56.089
like a superpower because if you are comfortable on

333
00:20:56.099 --> 00:20:59.689
your own, spending time on your own, you're very

334
00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:06.699
unlikely to feel lonely. And this love of being

335
00:21:06.709 --> 00:21:10.010
on your own has gotten the single at heart

336
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.410
through the pandemic, the worst of it. And it

337
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.839
also means that as we grow older, I'm already

338
00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:21.010
70. So I'm good. Um As we grow older,

339
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.219
we are very unlikely to be the caricature of

340
00:21:27.229 --> 00:21:32.180
an old single person who's isolated and lonely. We're

341
00:21:32.189 --> 00:21:34.459
unlikely to be lonely because we like our time

342
00:21:34.469 --> 00:21:39.099
alone in and we're unlikely to be lonely because

343
00:21:39.109 --> 00:21:44.500
we pay attention to and nurture our ties to,

344
00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:50.459
uh, whatever people we value without making our lives

345
00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:53.339
all about one person. Mhm.

346
00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:56.900
Uh, BY the way about not making our lives

347
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.560
about just one person. What kind, what other kinds

348
00:22:01.569 --> 00:22:05.630
of relationships can single at heart? People devote themselves

349
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:05.890
to.

350
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.849
Oh. Well, many of them have close friendships. Many

351
00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:13.589
have, uh, relatives that they care a lot about.

352
00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:18.709
They might have mentors, colleagues, teammates, et cetera, and

353
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.869
some people who are single at heart to have

354
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:29.229
romantic relationships, but they don't want to put that

355
00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:33.869
partner the center of their life. So they don't

356
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.619
want to do what sometimes is called riding the

357
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:43.069
romantic relationship, escalator. You start with dating and then

358
00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:45.910
maybe you date steadily and maybe you move in

359
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.099
together and get married and maybe you have kids

360
00:22:48.109 --> 00:22:54.310
and all the rest. Instead they want to um,

361
00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.079
have these relationships more casually and they're very upfront

362
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:03.719
about it. So no one's getting tricked or manipulated

363
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.760
a and do lots of single at heart. People

364
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.839
feel the need to have kids.

365
00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:16.540
Um, TWO people who are single at heart are

366
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.339
less likely to have kids than those who are

367
00:23:20.349 --> 00:23:22.619
not single at heart. But many people who are

368
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.650
single at heart do have kids. And rather than

369
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.920
telling these tales of woe that you hear so

370
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.489
much about all those poor single parents, they often

371
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.099
describe a special bond with their Children and they

372
00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:46.829
feel that their Children have some advantages. So they

373
00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:50.310
are never gonna be caught in a battle between

374
00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:53.619
their parents. They're not gonna be in a household

375
00:23:53.949 --> 00:23:58.160
with parents who are at each other's throats or,

376
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.770
um, treating each other coldly giving them the silent

377
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.239
treatment and so forth. Uh, SO they tell a

378
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.020
very positive stories about having Children

379
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.160
and I mean, on the point of solitude and

380
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.530
sometimes feeling lonely, isn't it also the case that

381
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.589
even p people can also sometimes feel lonely even

382
00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:23.359
if they are with another person?

383
00:24:23.969 --> 00:24:30.420
Yes. In fact, anecdotally, I've heard several times that

384
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.859
people say that the loneliest feeling is feeling alone

385
00:24:35.869 --> 00:24:39.699
when you're with a romantic partner because here's this

386
00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:43.380
person who's been held up to you as the

387
00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.680
answer to loneliness is supposed to protect you from

388
00:24:46.689 --> 00:24:50.739
that. So when you have that and you still

389
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:55.140
feel lonely, it's a very painful kind of loneliness.

390
00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.160
And I, I mean, in terms of life outcomes

391
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.540
because that's something that many people care about. And

392
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.410
there's some studies out there that people have run

393
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.430
for decades about what people need in life, for

394
00:25:11.439 --> 00:25:16.349
them to be psychologically healthy, for them to experience

395
00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:19.550
well being and have good life outcomes. How do

396
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.239
long lifelong single people compare to a couple of

397
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.609
people when it comes to?

398
00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:31.209
Well, you know what, what usually happens if you've

399
00:25:31.219 --> 00:25:33.349
heard over and over again? Oh, you know, married

400
00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:37.290
people do better than single people. That is a

401
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.390
comparison based on what I call the cheater technique.

402
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.329
So you take people who are currently married and

403
00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:48.189
you compare them to people who are currently single

404
00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:50.199
and if the married people are doing better, you

405
00:25:50.209 --> 00:25:53.520
say, ha ha. Look at that marriage makes people

406
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.689
happier. Well, you are ignoring all the people who

407
00:25:58.699 --> 00:26:00.890
got married and got divorced and they didn't get

408
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.140
divorced because they were so happily married. And that

409
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.310
could be as many as, you know, maybe 43%.

410
00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:11.130
So it's a huge number. If you wanna know

411
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:17.550
if marriage um makes people happier, you can't really

412
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.709
know that saying it makes people happier is a

413
00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:24.359
causal um statement which is hard to demonstrate because

414
00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:27.219
you can't randomly assign people to be married or

415
00:26:27.229 --> 00:26:29.949
single. But what you can do which is a

416
00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:35.250
close approximation. Not perfect is to follow the same

417
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.979
people over the course of their adult lives and

418
00:26:38.989 --> 00:26:41.550
ask them every year, how happy are you? How

419
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.859
happy are you? How happy are you and keep

420
00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:46.859
track of whether they're single or married? And there

421
00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:50.140
have been well over a dozen studies like this

422
00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.699
that go on for years and include thousands of

423
00:26:53.709 --> 00:26:59.140
people. And what they typically find is that people,

424
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:06.630
couples who get married, um feel a little happier

425
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.750
around the time of the wedding. You know, it's

426
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.520
a very exciting time. Everybody's giving them presents and

427
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.709
congratulating them. But then after a while, they go

428
00:27:16.719 --> 00:27:20.130
back to being as happy or as unhappy as

429
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:25.489
they were when they were single. And very importantly

430
00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:30.540
that um that period of happiness at the beginning,

431
00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.099
researchers sometimes call it the honeymoon effect. That only

432
00:27:35.109 --> 00:27:39.469
happens for people who get married and stay married,

433
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.619
for people who eventually divorce. And the researchers know

434
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.380
this because they have data on them for years

435
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.694
and years years. So the people who eventually divorce

436
00:27:49.704 --> 00:27:55.114
were already getting a little less happy as their

437
00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:58.665
wedding day approached, instead of getting more happy, which

438
00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:02.454
is what typically happens with people who get married

439
00:28:02.604 --> 00:28:05.484
and stay married. Now, I should also say that

440
00:28:05.744 --> 00:28:10.734
every social science study is based on averages. So

441
00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:15.574
I'm describing the average findings and they're always exceptions,

442
00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:19.229
right? A a and I mean, since we're also

443
00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:22.310
talking about marriage, something that came to mind right

444
00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:24.829
now. Uh uh I mean, I was thinking about

445
00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:29.699
people who are, who we are obviously always, I

446
00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:33.079
mean, not always but very commonly in contact with

447
00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:37.339
that are actually single at heart. People like priests

448
00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:40.910
like monks like, I don't know, there are even

449
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.709
political activists that just dedicate themselves to their political

450
00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:50.189
activities. Uh People who do volunteer work that uh

451
00:28:50.199 --> 00:28:53.060
I mean, just are interested in those kinds of

452
00:28:53.069 --> 00:28:56.270
things and I mean, those are all meaningful ways

453
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.589
of living that no one would question

454
00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:00.829
for sure. Yes.

455
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.500
So, and, and are there in terms of life

456
00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:09.670
outcomes are there particular differences between people who are

457
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.089
reluctantly single and the ones that are really single

458
00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:14.619
at heart.

459
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:20.069
Yes. So people who are single at harsh are

460
00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:23.329
more likely to be happy than people who are

461
00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.369
not single at heart because they have what they

462
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.859
want. You know, they wanna be single and they

463
00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:32.199
are single. Um, THEY also are especially likely to

464
00:29:32.209 --> 00:29:36.400
get happier and happier as they grow older, which

465
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.310
is contrary to the stereotype of single people, you

466
00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:43.270
know, those poor single people and they're just gonna

467
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.099
get sadder and lonelier as they grow older. Well,

468
00:29:47.109 --> 00:29:51.319
no, another thing is that people who want to

469
00:29:51.329 --> 00:29:56.510
be single tend to invest in their friends. So

470
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.699
they take their friendships more seriously, they value them

471
00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:04.439
more and it's a virtuous cycle where the more

472
00:30:04.449 --> 00:30:07.670
they value their friends, the happier they are with

473
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.045
their single lives and the happier they are with

474
00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:13.665
their single lives, the more they value their friends

475
00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:18.724
and people who are single at heart are also

476
00:30:18.734 --> 00:30:25.885
protected from the painful experience of single people who

477
00:30:25.895 --> 00:30:30.125
don't want to be single of what's called ambiguous

478
00:30:30.135 --> 00:30:34.599
loss. And that means, you know, they don't know

479
00:30:34.609 --> 00:30:37.069
if they're ever gonna get what they want. So

480
00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:42.489
they're in this ambiguous space where they might get

481
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.630
the life they want or they might not.

482
00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:51.189
And do you think that single people are victims

483
00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:53.469
of discrimination in the society?

484
00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:57.880
Oh, absolutely. Yes. Um, IN the United States, for

485
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:02.469
example, there are hundreds of laws that benefit and

486
00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:07.709
protect only people who are legally married. So that's

487
00:31:07.719 --> 00:31:09.780
a big one and it's not just in the

488
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:16.239
United States, there are also policies and practices that,

489
00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:21.069
that favor married people. So for example, in some

490
00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:26.900
workplaces, um single people are expected to cover for

491
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.900
married people if they wanna leave early or if

492
00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.780
they want to be with their spouse for some

493
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:36.380
reason. And excuse me, and that there are also,

494
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.839
um, ways that the people in the lives of

495
00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:45.060
married people are valued and favored. So, for example,

496
00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.199
in the United States we have what's called family

497
00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:53.739
and medical leave act. And that means you can

498
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.699
take time off to care for someone who needs

499
00:31:57.709 --> 00:32:05.020
help if that person is, um, your parent, your

500
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:10.540
child or your spouse. Mhm. Single people can take

501
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.979
time off from their parent or their child if

502
00:32:12.989 --> 00:32:16.140
they have one but they don't have anyone in

503
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:20.619
the spouse slot. So I can't take time off

504
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.819
under this law to care for a close friend

505
00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:28.560
or a sibling or, you know, someone else I

506
00:32:28.569 --> 00:32:31.109
really care about or maybe there's someone I'm not

507
00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:34.819
that close to, but I want to be there

508
00:32:34.829 --> 00:32:39.130
for them because I care about them and I

509
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.699
can't do that and none of those people can

510
00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:44.140
take time off to care for me.

511
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:50.079
Uh, THIS is actually something very negative in terms

512
00:32:50.089 --> 00:32:53.699
of politics, policy wise because since we tend to

513
00:32:53.709 --> 00:32:58.319
cater, uh, our policies to couples and families. I

514
00:32:58.329 --> 00:33:01.829
mean, there are many single people out there that

515
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.989
when they get older, I mean, they will experience

516
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.910
some, I mean, negative things, some hardships, not, not

517
00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.390
uh it's not their own fault, but just the

518
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.390
way society is structured.

519
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.290
Oh, sure, sure. In the United States, the health

520
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:27.449
care system is very focused on um conventional families.

521
00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:32.579
So you might, a hospital might require that you

522
00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:37.459
have a ride, um, back from a procedure, let's

523
00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:40.160
say you go in as an inpatient for procedure

524
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:45.349
where there might be, um, some anesthesia. Well, they

525
00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:49.089
will require that you have somebody to take you

526
00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:51.770
home and they won't let you use a taxi

527
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.209
or an Uber or something like that. Well, that's

528
00:33:54.219 --> 00:33:56.739
kind of assuming that, you know, you have a

529
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.050
spouse who's gonna be available and pick you up

530
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.579
and even people who are married don't always have

531
00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:07.699
a spouse is available. Uh, SO it's very geared

532
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:13.947
toward, um, a conventional model that most people are

533
00:34:13.958 --> 00:34:16.998
not even living in anymore. So, in the United

534
00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:22.688
States, if you were to knock on doors at

535
00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:27.819
random, you would more often be met with a

536
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:32.918
single person living alone than a household of mom,

537
00:34:32.928 --> 00:34:34.358
dad and the kids.

538
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.070
So I, I guess that this sort of discrimination

539
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.310
we've just talked about already points to at least

540
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.550
one aspect of this next question. But why do

541
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.570
you think it is so hard for many single

542
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.969
people to realize that it is fine. It is

543
00:34:52.978 --> 00:34:55.270
ok for them to stay single.

544
00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:02.419
Oh, yeah. Well, it starts with the way that

545
00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:06.780
single people are viewed are conventional wisdom, which of

546
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:13.050
course, is not very wise that insists that, um,

547
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.689
it's not natural or normal to stay single or

548
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:21.939
to want to be single and that's just not

549
00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:26.040
even questions. So, if that's the kind of world

550
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:30.100
view you're exposed to, it makes it hard to

551
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.199
understand that single life can be your best life

552
00:35:33.209 --> 00:35:39.409
also. Um Think about who is celebrated, who's respected.

553
00:35:39.419 --> 00:35:41.540
It's of course, people who get married or get

554
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:46.620
into romantic relationships and think about um movies, TV,

555
00:35:46.629 --> 00:35:54.610
shows song lyrics, novels, they all disproportionately celebrate people

556
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:59.929
who become romantically coupled. I mean, where do you

557
00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:05.649
ever find a single character who loves being single

558
00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:09.810
and wants to stay single and is not stigmatized

559
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.459
for it? Well, you don't even find them at

560
00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:14.270
all, much less how they people react to them.

561
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:18.290
So it's just, you know, it's just not out

562
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.270
there and that results in something that's really amazing,

563
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.280
which is that people who love their single life,

564
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:31.449
some people who love their single life um come

565
00:36:31.459 --> 00:36:34.100
to doubt themselves. So I think I love being

566
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.939
single. I wonder if there's something wrong with me.

567
00:36:37.149 --> 00:36:40.780
How ridiculous is that, that you have, what so

568
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.020
many people crave a life that you love and

569
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:48.219
instead of feeling proud, you're thinking, oh, what's wrong

570
00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:50.000
with me? That I have this life that I

571
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.879
love because it's a single life and I am

572
00:36:53.889 --> 00:36:57.379
trying to, uh, with my single heart book and

573
00:36:57.389 --> 00:37:00.510
my other writings and talks really push back on

574
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:00.739
that.

575
00:37:01.389 --> 00:37:05.580
Well, I guess that everyone wears some traits that

576
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.489
fall outside of the norm, experience some of that

577
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.080
to some extent. I mean, they sometimes question themselves

578
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.310
if they question if they are normal or not,

579
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.580
if there's something wrong with them. I mean, it's

580
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.020
not only in the case of single people, but

581
00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.780
I mean, that's there all the time,

582
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.050
right? Oh, sure. Um And so for example, people

583
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.689
who are not heterosexual have been stigmatized for a

584
00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:38.489
very long time and still are to some extent.

585
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:45.169
But there is much more awareness that um being

586
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.270
not heterosexual and all its many varieties of not

587
00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.110
things. So, uh is not something to be worried

588
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.370
about or self conscious about, but rather it can

589
00:37:58.379 --> 00:38:01.780
be, you know, very fulfilling life and the best

590
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.590
life for people who em embrace it. And that's

591
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:13.120
something that single people, regardless of their uh sexual

592
00:38:13.129 --> 00:38:17.260
or gender orientation or identity don't have yet. I

593
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.889
mean, my single heart book, I hope is pushing

594
00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:26.560
us toward that. But we really um lag behind

595
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:32.080
in cultural consciousness, social justice movements and so forth.

596
00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:35.699
Uh But uh I mean, where do you think

597
00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:41.580
that the social stigma against chronically single people stems

598
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.139
from, I mean, at a certain point there you

599
00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:46.540
mentioned for example, movies and other forms of art

600
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.590
and artistic expressions where we see all the time

601
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.739
that, uh, the hero or the main character always

602
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.570
asked to fall in love with someone and went

603
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.189
to have a partner. But apart from that, do

604
00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:01.830
you think that perhaps, uh, I mean, and of

605
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.179
course, I don't want to reduce everything to that,

606
00:39:04.189 --> 00:39:08.899
but since even biologically speaking, we are a sexually

607
00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:13.469
reproducing species that perhaps it has anything to do

608
00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:13.870
with that.

609
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.939
Oh, well, yeah. But you can have sex without

610
00:39:16.949 --> 00:39:22.290
being married. Uh, AND also I think another big

611
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:27.260
part of that, um, of the stigmatizing of single

612
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:34.209
people again comes from our worldviews. So lots of

613
00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:40.159
people want to believe that if you just find

614
00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:43.770
that one person commit to that person that you

615
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.520
really will live happily ever after that, that's not

616
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.189
a fairy tale. It's truth that once you find

617
00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:54.479
that person, all the pieces of your life fall

618
00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:57.709
in place and now you have your sexual partner

619
00:39:57.719 --> 00:40:01.580
and your confidant and your co financial manager and

620
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.010
your co parent if you have kids and all

621
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.600
the rest and that can be a very seductive

622
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.550
promise, you know, find this one person and you're

623
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:18.320
done. And, and also people really believe that that

624
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:23.689
is the one through path to happiness and fulfillment.

625
00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:27.270
And they want to believe that so single people

626
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:33.070
who stay single are stigmatized because they threaten that

627
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.370
worldview and the single people, several studies have shown

628
00:40:38.379 --> 00:40:43.530
who are especially likely to be put down like

629
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.449
the single people who like being single and again,

630
00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:51.659
single people who wanna stay single, who like being

631
00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:57.770
single are threatening that worldview that there's one royal

632
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.570
route to happiness and it's through romantic coupling.

633
00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:04.419
And by the way, I would imagine that this

634
00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:08.560
sort of stigma would extend to people who just

635
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.989
are not particularly interested in committed relationships. But when,

636
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.810
for example, casual relationships, casual sex, short term relationships

637
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.649
and all of that,

638
00:41:20.419 --> 00:41:24.729
yes, I think that um they are subject to

639
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:30.290
um stigma or at least harsh judgments

640
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.899
and by the way about that about sex do

641
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.939
single, I mean, what do the sex lives of

642
00:41:39.949 --> 00:41:43.610
single let heart people look like? I mean, are

643
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.000
at least some of them having sex even if

644
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.229
it's just casual or?

645
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.459
Yes. Yes. So it's a whole variety of things.

646
00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:57.459
Some have um you know, friends with benefits, some

647
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.760
uh get together casually and they make sure their

648
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.620
partners know about it. Some don't have sex and

649
00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:07.719
don't want it. So it really is uh the

650
00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:11.649
whole gamut. One person told me about uh being

651
00:42:11.659 --> 00:42:15.139
in college when she was in college, she had

652
00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:20.179
hookups and those are often, you know, considered uh

653
00:42:20.189 --> 00:42:25.310
bad by some of the people who um our

654
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:31.290
pundits. But she said that she loved that because

655
00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:37.610
her sex life was compartmentalized. So she had this

656
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.199
sex life, but then it didn't interfere with the

657
00:42:42.209 --> 00:42:44.729
rest of her life. So it didn't mean that

658
00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:49.229
she felt obligated to do stuff with their partner.

659
00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:51.389
She got to do all the other things in

660
00:42:51.399 --> 00:42:54.330
college. She loved doing like focus on her courses

661
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.770
or her friends or her interests. So

662
00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:02.229
how do you react? Uh Still talking about sex?

663
00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:05.790
How do you react to uh uh some of

664
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.270
those statistics that sometimes we come across about the

665
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.780
percentage of mostly young adults that uh have gone

666
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.389
without sex for a year or more or more

667
00:43:18.399 --> 00:43:21.820
and so on because usually people get really worried

668
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.540
about that. But do you think that perhaps uh

669
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.870
those statistics alone are not informative enough because maybe

670
00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:33.860
just, maybe some of these people are even not

671
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.729
that interested in sex to begin with?

672
00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:42.379
Exactly. Exactly. So it's worrisome if the people really

673
00:43:42.389 --> 00:43:45.020
do want sex and they're not getting it. Sure.

674
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.719
But in one way it's good is if these

675
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:53.760
statistics mean that more and more people who don't

676
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.860
want to have sex no longer feel as much

677
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.780
pressure to have sex or people who don't want

678
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:04.659
to have sex as often don't feel as pressured.

679
00:44:04.889 --> 00:44:09.580
And you can see that happening in a way

680
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.030
through um the growth of the a sexuality movement

681
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.530
where people who are not attracted to particular, other

682
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.489
people um come out as asexuals and they have

683
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.620
a lot of social support from other asexuals and

684
00:44:26.629 --> 00:44:30.000
there's a social movement about it. So that helps

685
00:44:30.929 --> 00:44:34.610
uh but another thing to keep in mind is

686
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:44.550
that and attitudes towards sex are important in shaping

687
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.439
how people feel about having sex or not having

688
00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:54.709
sex. So, when it is so valued and celebrated,

689
00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:59.790
that makes people who don't have sex, um, feel

690
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.530
badly about themselves. When, you know, if we were

691
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.389
a little more realistic about it, maybe there would

692
00:45:07.399 --> 00:45:11.719
be a little less pain for people who we're

693
00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:14.000
not having sex but wish they were.

694
00:45:15.169 --> 00:45:19.600
You know, sometimes it crosses my mind how society

695
00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.310
would look like in terms of how we think

696
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.469
about sex and sexless people. If we just thought,

697
00:45:27.479 --> 00:45:29.719
if we didn't make a big deal of it,

698
00:45:29.729 --> 00:45:32.120
if we just thought that, I mean, if you

699
00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:34.510
have sex, if you don't have sex, whatever, it

700
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.590
doesn't matter, it's not a big deal. I mean,

701
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.760
if you want to have sex, ok, then that's

702
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.949
perhaps something negative. But if you don't want to

703
00:45:42.959 --> 00:45:46.679
have, if you do not have it whatever, I

704
00:45:46.689 --> 00:45:50.580
mean, iii I just, sometimes I just imagine how

705
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:54.320
people would feel much, much better with themselves if

706
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.979
they didn't have that kind of social pressure and

707
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.060
if they were not ashamed of telling other people

708
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.540
that they, they haven't had sex for a while,

709
00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:10.540
correct? You're describing a societal idea in my mind.

710
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.489
So do you think that your book also ties

711
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.770
in any way to some other changes in people's

712
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.500
ways of partnering that we have seen raising over

713
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.770
the past few decades with the decline of marriage,

714
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.500
for example.

715
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:32.290
Yeah, for sure. So I think the rise of

716
00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.739
the single at heart and people who like being

717
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:41.729
single goes along with the increasing valuing of friendship.

718
00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:44.570
I think people are starting to take their friends

719
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.889
more seriously and evaluate more. It also goes along

720
00:46:48.899 --> 00:46:53.360
with um different ways of living that we're seeing

721
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.399
now, for example, couples who are committed to each

722
00:46:57.409 --> 00:47:00.510
other, but don't want to live in the same

723
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.350
place. It's sometimes called living apart together. It's also

724
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.030
relevant, I think to other ways of living. For

725
00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:14.840
example, um people who live in cohousing communities where

726
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:19.969
everyone has their own house or apartment and inside

727
00:47:19.979 --> 00:47:24.969
the house or apartment might be any combination of

728
00:47:24.979 --> 00:47:27.139
people that you'd find anywhere, you know, a solo

729
00:47:27.149 --> 00:47:32.120
person or um a couple or 22 friends or

730
00:47:32.129 --> 00:47:38.169
whatever. Um But a cohousing community is a community.

731
00:47:38.179 --> 00:47:42.709
So they deliberately want to have social interaction with

732
00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:45.729
each other. There's usually a common house where they

733
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.729
can meet for, for meals if they want to,

734
00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:53.449
the common house often has um washers and dryers.

735
00:47:53.459 --> 00:47:55.370
So everyone doesn't have it in their house and

736
00:47:55.379 --> 00:47:58.270
they meet each other there and there are rooms

737
00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:04.409
for pursuing interests like um maybe musical interests or

738
00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:10.209
art or whatever. And so, um that too is

739
00:48:10.219 --> 00:48:15.689
consistent with the development of, of different ways of

740
00:48:15.699 --> 00:48:20.179
living, of more open mindedness about how we can

741
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:25.479
live, who we can value. And how to organize

742
00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:26.040
a life.

743
00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:29.250
Do you think that there are things in your

744
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.629
book that even people who are interested in romantic

745
00:48:32.639 --> 00:48:36.949
relationships and are at the moment in romantic relationships

746
00:48:36.959 --> 00:48:41.510
can bring into their own relationships that perhaps would

747
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.534
help them. They, with some, I don't know, negative

748
00:48:45.544 --> 00:48:46.614
aspects of them.

749
00:48:46.915 --> 00:48:52.774
Right. I think that if more people became familiar

750
00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:56.014
with my single atte heart book, which I'm gonna

751
00:48:56.024 --> 00:49:00.415
show you now, that's OK. This is it. So

752
00:49:00.425 --> 00:49:02.645
I don't know if you can see it anyway.

753
00:49:03.254 --> 00:49:10.419
OK. Couldn't resist. Um THAT I think couples would

754
00:49:10.429 --> 00:49:15.860
do better because they would understand that if somebody

755
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:22.090
wants some space, it's not necessarily criticism of their

756
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.399
partner. It could mean they could understand that if

757
00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:28.399
somebody wants to spend time with their friends apart

758
00:49:28.409 --> 00:49:32.340
from their partner, that's not necessarily a criticism of

759
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:36.830
their partner. So I think it opens the door

760
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:45.679
to a more generous and less um less envious

761
00:49:45.689 --> 00:49:48.659
or suspicious kind of interaction.

762
00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:54.050
So just one last question then uh what would

763
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.110
be perhaps a message that you would have for

764
00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.929
people out there that are currently single and perhaps

765
00:50:00.939 --> 00:50:05.060
they experience all of these kinds of social pressures

766
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.879
that we've talked about here. And they are perhaps

767
00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:12.750
not sure if they are actually single at heart

768
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.310
or not, but perhaps they at least want to

769
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.310
try to go through this period of their lives

770
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.780
as smoothly as possible.

771
00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:26.770
I would tell them to live their single years,

772
00:50:27.139 --> 00:50:31.669
fully joyfully and unapologetically.

773
00:50:33.709 --> 00:50:36.969
OK. So that's a great uh note to end

774
00:50:36.979 --> 00:50:39.689
on. And the book is again single at heart,

775
00:50:39.699 --> 00:50:43.639
the power, freedom and heart, feeling, joy of single

776
00:50:43.649 --> 00:50:46.010
life. I'm leaving a link to it in the

777
00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.820
