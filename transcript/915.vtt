00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.109
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.010
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.810
today I'm here for a second time with Doctor

4
00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.180
Bernard Bernard Regin, he's Professor of Philosophy at Brown

5
00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:18.239
University. So in our previous interview, we talked about

6
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.700
his book, The Affirmation of Life Nietzsche on overcoming

7
00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:23.780
nihilism. And I'm leaving a link to it in

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.120
the description box of this interview. And today we're

9
00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.579
talking about another one of his books, uh The

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.799
Will To Nothingness, an essay on Nietzsche's on the

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.209
genealogy of morality. So, Doctor Regin, welcome back to

12
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.299
the show. It's always a pleasure to have everyone.

13
00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.139
Thank you. The pleasure is mine, Ricardo.

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.720
So uh to start our conversation with um what

15
00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.619
is basically the premise of on the genealogy of

16
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.340
morality by Nietzsche.

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.880
Well, the genus of moti is uh unlike most

18
00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.200
of other niches, books in, in so far as

19
00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.930
it seems to have a very determinate focus, which

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.830
is a uh a critical examination of uh Christian

21
00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:14.080
morality as uh which is the uh uh the

22
00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:17.319
moral look that started with Christianity. But that then

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.470
uh is the basic inspiration for uh the uh

24
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.550
the modern circular variants of it are in the

25
00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:31.790
enlightenment, especially the morality of human rights. For example,

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.930
I mean, any a moral outlook that basically considers

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.709
that uh uh each and every human being possesses

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.470
an equal moral standing and as such is entitled

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.849
to basic respect and consideration. Um NOT despite its

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.050
tight focus and its uh its seeming systematic shape.

31
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.790
Uh The book is uh still uh created a

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.169
great deal of puzzlement. So, uh there's a Bernard

33
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.699
Williams for, for example, famously described it as a

34
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.949
book that uh on the one hand seems to

35
00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.000
be hitting on something with great exactitude, but on

36
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.179
the other also remains infuriatingly vague. These are his

37
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.240
words. Um So the purpose of my book was

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.600
to try to uh understand uh what kind of

39
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:24.309
uh argument, uh especially critical argument Nietzsche develops against

40
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.470
Christian Mor. I mean, Nietzsche is famous for uh

41
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.710
attacking Christian morality for calling it into question. But

42
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.399
uh there's a, there remains a great deal of

43
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.639
controversy and puzzlement as to what exactly he finds

44
00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.880
objectionable about it.

45
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.360
Uh And what does it mean to call the

46
00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:52.080
genealogy of morality uh form of epistemic debunking. What

47
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.389
does that mean exactly?

48
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.220
Well, so the, the, the most, well, one of

49
00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.380
the most puzzling aspects of Nietzsche's project in that

50
00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.300
book is that he claims to be able to

51
00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:12.089
derive normative conclusions about Christian morality from a historical

52
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.229
investigation into its origin and development, a genealogy of

53
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.470
it so to speak. And uh philosophers have long

54
00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:24.050
puzzled over uh how that argument could work. I

55
00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.190
mean, uh so people worried that Nietzsche was committing

56
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.490
a famous fallacy known as the genetic fallacy, which

57
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.279
is the idea that you could uh imper the

58
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.529
truth of a statement by looking at the way

59
00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.919
the statements, the statement came about. Uh So obviously,

60
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.029
that's a fallacy. But uh philosophers have since then

61
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.229
reconsidered gene arguments and one of the most influential

62
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.100
forms uh that argument has been given is the

63
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.570
form of epistemic debunking. So the idea is that

64
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.889
uh you cannot show that the belief is false

65
00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.750
by examining the way in which the belief came

66
00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.550
about. But you can raise questions about whether the

67
00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.500
agent who holds the belief, uh a belief that

68
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.679
is being formed in this particular way is actually

69
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.945
justified in holding the belief, that's what's known as

70
00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.795
epistemic debunking. So if you find that we believe

71
00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:22.804
as a certain kind of history that for example,

72
00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:25.875
it came about through the operation of mechanisms and

73
00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:29.445
processes that are not epistemic reliable, that are not

74
00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:31.595
the kinds of things that usually track the truth

75
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.095
about the world. Then it gives you a reason

76
00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:36.274
to reduce the confidence that you place in the

77
00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:40.350
belief. So, so that's one form of uh this

78
00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:43.690
one form of uh uh one way of interpreting

79
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.540
Genea arguments that has been attributed to Nietzsche. I

80
00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:49.260
don't think uh as you know, I I don't

81
00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:53.320
think ultimately, this is uh this is what Nietzsche

82
00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:56.170
uh uh takes his critique of morality to consist

83
00:04:56.179 --> 00:05:00.170
of. He doesn't simply try to show that uh

84
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.739
uh people who hold, who subscribe to Christian morality

85
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.230
in fact, are on thin epistemic grant when they

86
00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:07.829
do so.

87
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.890
And when it comes to the approach Nietzsche uses

88
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.989
in this book to tackle the genealogy of morality.

89
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.109
Would you say it is a naturalistic one?

90
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.260
Well, it's naturalistic in the sense that he tries

91
00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.989
to avoid any kind in his explanation of what

92
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.940
moral it is, how it came about and so

93
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.109
on and so forth. He tries to avoid any

94
00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.410
kind of reference to factors that are not part

95
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.739
of nature, that are not the kinds of factors

96
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.420
that could be observed recorded documented by the natural

97
00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:47.750
sciences where by natural sciences that includes what we

98
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.059
would call the social sciences like psychology, for example.

99
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.239
And so in that respect, his approach is in

100
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.309
fact naturalistic. So he gives an explanation of how

101
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.359
Mo came about that doesn't involve the operation of

102
00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:10.809
entities such as God that doesn't involve our possession

103
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.440
of special properties like freedom of will, that doesn't

104
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.690
involve positing normative facts or entities that could not

105
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.980
be observed and known by the use of the

106
00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:28.470
methods of natural sciences and so on and so

107
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.910
forth.

108
00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:35.079
Mhm And what this functionality mean in the context

109
00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.940
of morality. Well,

110
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.970
so the my approach to uh uh to the

111
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.640
genealogical explanation of uh of certain judgments is uh

112
00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:52.670
uh differs from uh uh uh from the, the,

113
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.250
the, the, the epistemic approach that you mentioned earlier,

114
00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.540
right? So, uh Nietzsche, so, so for the people

115
00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:02.559
who hold the epistemic view niche is in the

116
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.100
business of calling into question whether our moral beliefs,

117
00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:09.369
we have reasons to take our moral beliefs to

118
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.769
be true or not. But in fact, Nietzsche, on

119
00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:15.670
a number of occasions, deny that what's important about

120
00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:18.209
beliefs in general. But moral beliefs in particular is

121
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.519
whether or not they are true, as he famously

122
00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.799
says, what's new about my approach is that whether

123
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.160
a judgment is true is not what's important, you

124
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.029
know, what is important in his view is uh

125
00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:35.450
what it does to the individual who holds the

126
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.589
belief, to hold that belief, what kind of, what

127
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.549
kind of a functional benefit that person or the

128
00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:48.519
group to which that person belongs by derive from

129
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.230
uh from holding that particular belief. So the issue,

130
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.339
when you look at the moral belief on each

131
00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:56.609
a like, for example, it is good to help

132
00:07:56.619 --> 00:07:58.589
the needy. The issue is not whether or not

133
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.950
the belief is true, whether it tracks certain normative

134
00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:07.640
objective facts about uh the, the value or the

135
00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:11.109
rightness of helping the needy. But the question is

136
00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:18.899
whether uh it is useful for individuals to hold

137
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.619
and govern their lives by the light of such

138
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.359
beliefs. So that's what he means by, that's what

139
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:28.859
I mean by a functional approach. And so Nietzsche's

140
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:33.229
ultimate claim is that while more Christian moral beliefs

141
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.039
have a kind of uh functionality, that functionality is

142
00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.049
somehow defective, that's the claim that I want to

143
00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:41.130
make at the end of the day.

144
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:48.249
And all those Nietzsche uh approach moralities psychologically.

145
00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:53.890
Well, so he famously says in, uh in, he

146
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.200
doesn't say so directly in the gene energy of

147
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.349
morality. But uh he says so in the book

148
00:08:59.359 --> 00:09:01.179
that he wrote right before, which is Beyond Good

149
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.549
and evil. And then he says it again uh

150
00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.510
in books that directly follow the general morality, such

151
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.539
as for example, the twilight of the idols, he

152
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:14.349
famously says that moralities in general are a sign

153
00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:19.299
language of effects. Uh And there's a, there's a

154
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:24.219
of course, a big discussion in the scholarly tera

155
00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:27.039
as to what exactly he means by this. Well,

156
00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:33.000
the standard view is that Nietzsche simply is advocating

157
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.650
here a kind of sentimentalism about value and sentimentalism

158
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.590
about value is I mean, it, it, it has

159
00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:42.669
several dimensions. But basically, it's the idea that uh

160
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.590
when I make a more judgment such as helping

161
00:09:46.599 --> 00:09:50.880
the needy is right. Uh I express uh a

162
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:57.119
sentiment that I have towards uh neediness or towards

163
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.820
the act of helping the needy. So a sentiment

164
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.739
of aversion towards neediness and a sentiment of inclination

165
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.169
towards the act of helping the needy and relieving

166
00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:10.429
them of their suffering. Uh So that's a standard

167
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.940
view now, uh I, you know, I I argue

168
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.309
and we cannot go into the detail because there

169
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.719
are some technical details involved here. But I argue

170
00:10:19.729 --> 00:10:22.369
that this cannot possibly be by what uh what

171
00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:25.989
Nietzsche has in mind when he says that moralities

172
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.919
are a sign language of the fact. Uh If

173
00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:32.539
only because uh the effects that are supposed to

174
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:37.289
explain the moral judgments do not uh connect especially

175
00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.320
in each particular examples uh with one another in

176
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.830
the way that they should, if he were just

177
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.570
an ordinary sentimentalist about uh about moral judgments, uh

178
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.150
by the way, that sentimentalist about moral judgment is

179
00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:53.789
a view that was uh fairly well known, at

180
00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:57.570
least in, in, in British philosophy from the uh

181
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.289
17th and 18th century. Uh And so, if, if

182
00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:04.989
Nietzsche simply were borrowing their views, you would have

183
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.140
expected him to at least acknowledge as much, but

184
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.869
he doesn't. And it's because I think that the

185
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.900
connection that he thinks that he takes there to

186
00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:19.690
be between more judgments and affect states is not

187
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.150
an expressive relation as it will have to be

188
00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:26.260
in sentimentalism, but a functional relation. The idea being

189
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.429
that uh uh in his view, more judgments can

190
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.500
be understood in terms of the particular role they

191
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.109
play in the effective lives of the agents who

192
00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:41.440
holds all those judgments and live by them. For

193
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.609
example, in terms of the whatever uh effective benefits

194
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.679
uh holding those judgments might have for them, uh

195
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.119
the benefits, for example, in uh fulfilling certain effective

196
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.359
needs they may have.

197
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.340
And of course, uh Nietzsche in his philosophy talks

198
00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:02.549
a lot about one particular kind of effect that

199
00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:07.679
he names re Sanima. So what is the role

200
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:13.549
that uh Reima plays in the way he understands

201
00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:14.580
morality?

202
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.400
Well, so, yeah, so the, the, the concept of

203
00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:21.359
reima plays a very prominent role in the gender

204
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.530
of m niche. Doesn't DJ doesn't talk much about

205
00:12:25.539 --> 00:12:30.280
it before he writes that book. Uh But the,

206
00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:34.280
the, the concept itself is probably present because he,

207
00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:37.400
he clearly seems it's, it's a bit mysterious exactly

208
00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:40.570
how these two things relate. But uh clearly thinks

209
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.960
that uh Reiman is connected to what he calls

210
00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:47.179
revengeful. That root is the motivational state that the

211
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.890
emotional state that motivates revenge. And he talks about

212
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.489
revengeful, you know, from his earlier works on uh

213
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.280
but he introduces the concept of anti specifically in

214
00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:02.669
the gender of morality. And it's been a bit

215
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:07.380
of a uh it's an ongoing question exactly what

216
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.969
he means by this. So the concept of reti

217
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.000
is a French word uh that Nietzsche uses deliberately

218
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.169
because uh there are German terms that are in

219
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:21.369
the vicinity of uh what roti means. Like the

220
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.179
word grow for example. But I think, and my,

221
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.119
my German native German friends uh tell me so

222
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.150
that it does quite capture the meaning of what

223
00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:38.109
in English we call resentment. So remo is the

224
00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:41.320
French word that translates the English resentment. Now, the

225
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:46.320
problem with claiming that niche when he talks about

226
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.559
reso has in mind, what we in English mean,

227
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.130
resentment is that in English, uh resentment is taken

228
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.429
on a very strong moral connotation. So resentment is

229
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.760
uh your response to the fact that you have

230
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.359
been wronged to the fact that you're the victim

231
00:14:03.369 --> 00:14:06.210
of an injustice, for example. But it can be

232
00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:10.760
what Nietzsche has in mind precisely because he takes

233
00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:16.659
the effect of remo to explain why we came

234
00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:19.989
up with more values and more judgments in the

235
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.590
first place. So it cannot be reso resentment because

236
00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:26.510
resentment presupposes that we already have those beliefs and

237
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:33.039
values. Um So my rough sense is that resent

238
00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:37.070
more uh captures what we in English means resentment.

239
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.450
But what we sometimes mean by resentment when we

240
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.849
think of it as a non moral emotion. So

241
00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:46.119
John Stuart Mill for example, distinguishes between what he

242
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.849
calls more resentment, which is resentment when it is

243
00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:52.770
a response to injustice or wrong from natural resentment,

244
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.020
which he associates, for example, with revenge. Now, he

245
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.650
doesn't say much about what it is. And one

246
00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:00.340
of the questions for me in the book was

247
00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:04.989
to try to understand uh you know what, what

248
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.570
riot is about what it is responsive to why

249
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.340
it motivates revenge and so on and so forth.

250
00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:16.849
And so the basic idea is that uh resent

251
00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:20.700
him for it is linked to uh what he

252
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.580
calls the will to power. When you understand the

253
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.960
will to power as a kind of psychological state,

254
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:29.849
a motivational state, you know, like a desire or

255
00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:33.820
an inclination or a drive towards power. But where

256
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.119
power is to be understood in very specific ways,

257
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.789
or it's not to be understood in the way

258
00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:41.580
in which it's usually understood. I mean, when you

259
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.210
think about power, you think about control, you think

260
00:15:45.219 --> 00:15:48.630
about dominance and things of that nature. Uh But

261
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.679
what Nietzsche means by power is uh is, is

262
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.669
more specific than that. The reason is that control

263
00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:58.179
and dominance are things that typically you don't want

264
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.479
for their own sake. There are things that you

265
00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:02.049
want for the sake of what they allow you

266
00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:04.530
to do. So uh my having control over a

267
00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:08.099
piece of territory over the people, you know, allow

268
00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:10.119
me to make sure that they do my bidding

269
00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:14.000
uh Same with dominance. But Nietzsche clearly seems to

270
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.919
think that power is something that we want for

271
00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:18.289
its own sake. Something that's the object of an

272
00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:21.719
intrinsic desire to use that terminology. And so what

273
00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:24.950
you need is an understanding of power that makes

274
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.739
it intelligible that this is something that you would

275
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.969
want for its own sake. And so the idea

276
00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.630
that I have and it, it draws on some

277
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.150
of the metaphors that Nietzsche uses in his discussion

278
00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:40.830
of power. Uh IS that power is the fact

279
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.659
of having your presence in the world make a

280
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:46.349
causal difference in it. It's the idea of making

281
00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:49.000
your mark on the world or making the world

282
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:53.080
reflect uh reflect your presence in it where your

283
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.729
presence in it is your presence under a specific

284
00:16:55.739 --> 00:16:58.630
description. So for example, in the case of human

285
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.369
beings, your presence as an agent with a will,

286
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.650
particular values, particular aspirations and so on and so

287
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.189
forth.

288
00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:11.400
So at a certain point there you mentioned revengeful.

289
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:16.699
So and Nietzsche in his book talks about Christianity

290
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.459
or Christian morality as an act of revenge. What

291
00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:22.060
does that mean? Exactly?

292
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:28.959
Ah, that's the 65,000 $64,000 question. Uh uh That's,

293
00:17:28.969 --> 00:17:31.939
that's really the, I mean, the most arresting claim

294
00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:34.099
of the book. I mean, that Christian morality, the

295
00:17:34.109 --> 00:17:36.780
invention of Christian morality is an act of revenge

296
00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:40.099
and it's puzzling in all kinds of ways, right?

297
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:44.579
It's puzzling in the first instance because when you

298
00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:48.660
think about revenge in the paradigmatic cases, you think

299
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.030
about my wanting to make somebody suffer because they

300
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.750
have made me suffer, you know, uh think about

301
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.579
revenge as violent retaliation of some kind. But, but

302
00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:02.030
the invention of Christian morality is, is not a

303
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.800
violent retaliation. It's uh it's basically the devising of

304
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.439
a new moral outlook. So, so it's very hard

305
00:18:09.449 --> 00:18:12.439
to say to begin with how this, the invention

306
00:18:12.449 --> 00:18:14.660
of certain values could count as revenge in the

307
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.609
first place. So, so that already shows that when,

308
00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:19.810
when he thinks about revenge. Niche must have a

309
00:18:19.819 --> 00:18:23.089
fairly capacious understanding of it. And in fact, if

310
00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:28.849
you start scoring his works for uh uh for

311
00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:32.099
instances in which he uses the concept of revenge,

312
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.660
you realize that he, he he he takes the

313
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.469
concept of revenge uh to have a very broad

314
00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:41.280
meaning. So for example, acts of gratitude can be

315
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.819
acts of revenge for him. Acts of forgiveness. Christian

316
00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:47.209
forgiveness. He describes explicit ingen, it can be an

317
00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:50.150
act of revenge. Acts of beneficence can be acts

318
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.390
of revenge. And then he also argues that you

319
00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:57.560
can take revenge, not just against other people, but

320
00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:01.459
you can take revenge against impersonal entities like life.

321
00:19:01.469 --> 00:19:03.890
So in the third essay of the genealogy, he

322
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.880
says that the invention of asceticism was an act

323
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.435
of revenge against life. You can revenge against time,

324
00:19:11.444 --> 00:19:14.714
you can take revenge against reality for NC. So,

325
00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:18.704
so it's very, very puzzling, right? So my, my

326
00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:21.675
thought here, my driving thought and by the way,

327
00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:24.025
I'm writing a new book about revenge just in

328
00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:27.045
order to clarify those issues at the moment. But

329
00:19:27.055 --> 00:19:33.479
my driving thought is that so Simon is the

330
00:19:33.489 --> 00:19:39.000
response that you have when uh uh your, your

331
00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.760
power, the sense that your presence in the world

332
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.800
is, doesn't make a difference in it or doesn't

333
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.869
make the difference that you expect uh is, is,

334
00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.770
is challenged. It's called into question, it's called into

335
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.449
doubt. OK. So resentment is so to speak. Uh

336
00:19:57.459 --> 00:20:01.280
uh A fight response against doubts raised about your

337
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.959
power. So for example, when somebody treats you as

338
00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:07.010
if you're nothing, when they make you suffer, they,

339
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.449
they, they, they disregard your will and so on

340
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.930
and so forth. That's a paradigmatic instance in which

341
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.770
uh you're liable to feel or to be made

342
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.579
to feel impotent. And one of the response that

343
00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:21.910
you can have of course is shame, which is

344
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.630
when you withdraw, when you, when you uh when

345
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.000
you submit, when you comply or you can have,

346
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.979
which is a flight response or you can have

347
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:31.890
a fight response, which is to respond and to

348
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.030
try to assert your power, for example, by making

349
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.640
suffer, the person who has made you suffer by

350
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.939
imposing your will upon theirs after they have imposed

351
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:45.680
their will upon yours. OK. So, so revenge uh

352
00:20:45.689 --> 00:20:49.239
is the act whereby you attempt to restore your

353
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.270
power in that sense? OK. So the question is,

354
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.520
well, how could the invention of new values constitute

355
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.280
an act of revenge for the right? Well, so

356
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.800
the idea is this right? There are, there are

357
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.040
two elements to power, right? So, so power is

358
00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:07.550
you want your presence in the world to make

359
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.959
a difference in it? But the second element is

360
00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:12.530
that you want your presence in the world under

361
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.000
a certain description. OK. So what I am is

362
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.459
an agent with a certain kind of will with

363
00:21:19.469 --> 00:21:22.619
my my will. In this case, for niche is

364
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.579
the repository of my values, my aspiration, what I

365
00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:28.459
consider to be important. So what it is for

366
00:21:28.469 --> 00:21:31.250
me to have power or to feel as though

367
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.050
I have power is that I am able to

368
00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:38.319
make it so that the world around me reflect

369
00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:40.709
my presence in it. For example, by realizing my

370
00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:45.439
values, you know, and I'm liable to feel as

371
00:21:45.449 --> 00:21:49.390
though I am important. If my will, my values

372
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.280
and my pursuit of them, my agency make no

373
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.229
difference in that world. So the idea is that

374
00:21:57.239 --> 00:22:01.510
our Christianity for each or at least Christian morality

375
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.670
is an act of revenge for people whose will

376
00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:08.189
has made no difference in the world. But they,

377
00:22:08.199 --> 00:22:10.790
but they, they realize that they have no option

378
00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:14.729
in order to be, become able to make a

379
00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:18.319
difference in the world other than by altering the

380
00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:23.280
contents of their will by altering the description under

381
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.479
which they want to make a difference in the

382
00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:28.180
world. Ok? So the idea is that, well, look,

383
00:22:28.189 --> 00:22:31.390
if you can't bend the world to your will,

384
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.319
maybe you can change your will so that whatever

385
00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:35.920
it is that you can do will count as

386
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.040
bending the world to your will. So changing your

387
00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.250
values is like changing what is going to count

388
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.209
as power for you. Ok? And in this case,

389
00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:47.719
if the motivation is to restore your feeling of

390
00:22:47.729 --> 00:22:50.849
power, to make it the case again, that you

391
00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.479
can feel as though your presence in the world

392
00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:55.170
makes a difference in it. Then the invention of

393
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.170
Christian morality is an act of revenge.

394
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.680
And so what would be the goals of revenge

395
00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:06.709
in Christian morality? Does it have any specific goals

396
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:07.319
or not?

397
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.060
Well, ok, so, so a big question when you

398
00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:15.439
think about revenge in general is precisely the question

399
00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:18.040
of what the goal of revenge is, right? I

400
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.180
mean, so again, the paradigmatic instance is that you

401
00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:26.869
caused me to suffer and my revenge, my retaliation

402
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.670
is to make you suffer because you made me

403
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.439
suffer. And then the question is well, but what

404
00:23:32.449 --> 00:23:34.709
do I get out of this? Ok. So you

405
00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:36.750
made me suffer and I made you suffer in

406
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.560
return, I retaliate. What's the purpose of my retaliation?

407
00:23:40.569 --> 00:23:44.219
What do I accomplish with that retaliation? What do

408
00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:46.880
I achieve or what is my aim in retaliating?

409
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.859
What am I trying to achieve when I retaliate?

410
00:23:49.729 --> 00:23:52.670
So that's a, that's a difficult question. And for

411
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:59.280
this has that question I think has motivated are

412
00:23:59.869 --> 00:24:02.410
the view that many philosophers take up to this

413
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.060
day, which consists in treating revenge as a kind

414
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:10.609
of punishment. So, so revenge is basically punishment. But

415
00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:15.479
in circumstances where there are no institutions of justice

416
00:24:15.489 --> 00:24:18.140
capable of meeting out the punishment so that the

417
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.800
individual him or herself has, as we say, to

418
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.020
take the law into his own hands or into

419
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.160
her own hands. OK. So revenge in this way

420
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.859
to use Francis Bacon's famous phrase is wild justice.

421
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.790
It's justice, it aims at justice but in conditions

422
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.390
in wild conditions or conditions of wilderness. Ok. So

423
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.800
you know, uh the American Western movies, for example,

424
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.739
is, you know, is almost always about revenge. But

425
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.939
in this case, you can say that it's revenge.

426
00:24:49.949 --> 00:24:52.260
It's wild that this revenge is wild justice because

427
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.390
what they try to, to achieve is justice. But

428
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.000
under conditions of wilderness where there are no institutions,

429
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:03.520
there's no effective police institution, there's no system of

430
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.260
justice and the individual has to then you know,

431
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.859
be the judge and the executioner him or herself.

432
00:25:09.609 --> 00:25:16.479
Um Now again, if revenge aimed at justice for

433
00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:19.930
Nietzsche, then it would Presuppose the morality that he

434
00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:24.229
thinks is created by revenge. So Nietzsche must have

435
00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:27.170
an understanding of revenge, which is not moral or

436
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.949
not moralized in that way. And in fact, there

437
00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:34.979
are some philosophers uh who have argued that revenge

438
00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:37.640
does not aim at justice that uh if you,

439
00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:40.949
if you make me suffer, uh when I take

440
00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:43.260
revenge, I don't come true. You're making me suffer

441
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.479
as a wrong or as an injustice. And then

442
00:25:45.489 --> 00:25:48.589
my retaliation would be a form of punishment. Something

443
00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:51.140
else is going on. But then that's the mystery.

444
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.790
What else is going on if when I retaliate

445
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.180
against you for having made me suffer, I'm not,

446
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.839
my aim is not to punish you. My aim

447
00:26:00.849 --> 00:26:03.150
is not for example, to deter you from doing

448
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.790
something wrong. My aim is not to make sure

449
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.349
you don't get away with it, that you get

450
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:10.670
what you deserve. My aim must be something else.

451
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.790
And the question is, well, what is the aim

452
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.869
of revenge? And my, my idea is that the

453
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.430
aim of revenge again is, you know, power in

454
00:26:18.439 --> 00:26:21.219
the specific sense in which I understand it. It's

455
00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:26.300
to uh restoring yourself the sense that your presence

456
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.829
in the world makes a difference in it. And

457
00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:31.209
the idea, the reason why this is not more

458
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:35.770
is because this, this need for power is a

459
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.089
very fundamental, very basic psychological need uh which is

460
00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:44.140
connected in my view, I mean, II, I can

461
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.459
try to explain this to you but uh uh

462
00:26:46.569 --> 00:26:50.339
but it's connected with uh the importance uh of

463
00:26:50.349 --> 00:26:53.979
um it's connected with our, our feeling of existence,

464
00:26:53.989 --> 00:26:55.849
our sense that we are, as we say in,

465
00:26:55.869 --> 00:26:58.219
I agree, we are somebody, you know, some people

466
00:26:58.229 --> 00:27:01.500
feel like I'm a nobody. And what it usually

467
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.199
means is that when they feel like they are

468
00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:05.969
nobodies, it is because they feel that their presence

469
00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:08.390
in the world makes no difference in it. They

470
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.819
don't accomplish anything, they are done, they go unnoticed,

471
00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:14.989
they are invisible to others and so on and

472
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.260
so forth. And sometimes in those circumstances, they will

473
00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.979
react revengefully, they will want to do something that

474
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.680
changes their sense of themselves as nobody is. They

475
00:27:26.689 --> 00:27:30.250
will make them feel like they are somebody Uh

476
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.520
So I think that the aim of revenge when

477
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:39.290
it's considered, you know, uh a non moral impulse

478
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.219
is this, it's what Nietzsche calls power.

479
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.319
So earlier, we've talked about uh functionality. Would you

480
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:51.640
say that, uh Christian morality or the Christian moral

481
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.599
outlook is itself functional?

482
00:27:55.949 --> 00:27:58.819
Well, yes. So the, the, the function, so reti

483
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.479
is an effective state, you know, remember that niche

484
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.300
claims, I mean, the, the, the sort of the,

485
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.469
the view of moral belief or morality or moral

486
00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:12.810
judgment that uh uh that underlies niches project in

487
00:28:12.819 --> 00:28:16.550
the genealogy. Is this idea that moralities are sign

488
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.260
language of effects that mm more judgments or, or

489
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.819
systems of moral judgments. Uh Excuse me, my, my,

490
00:28:23.829 --> 00:28:25.849
my dog is making some noise there. I don't

491
00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:30.069
know, no worries. No, no, no, no. Uh So

492
00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:34.319
moralities and moral judgments are, are, you know, um

493
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.410
uh not expressions of effects but they are, they

494
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.630
are uh they are causally related to those effects

495
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.510
underlying Nietzsche's approach to Christian morality in the, in

496
00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:47.729
the g of Mor is the idea that uh

497
00:28:47.739 --> 00:28:53.229
uh more judgments, more beliefs, more concepts uh have

498
00:28:53.239 --> 00:28:56.989
a certain kind of uh functional role to play

499
00:28:57.699 --> 00:29:03.300
in the effective emotional economy of agents. OK. So

500
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.770
uh you know, my holding a certain belief like

501
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.459
helping the needy is good or my holding a

502
00:29:08.469 --> 00:29:10.640
certain conception of what justice is and so on

503
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:15.140
and so forth. All of these things are, are,

504
00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.680
can be, can be understood as being in some

505
00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:21.550
sense designed to play a certain kind of role

506
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.430
in my emotional economy uh to, to uh satisfy

507
00:29:26.439 --> 00:29:29.489
certain emotional needs. Now, the question is, well, what

508
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.880
is the emotional need that's being satisfied by uh

509
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.670
by Christian morality? And according to Nietzsche, the emotional

510
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.040
need that's being satisfied is the emotional need that's

511
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:41.439
expressed uh or enshrined in the effect of resentment.

512
00:29:42.339 --> 00:29:45.569
It's the need to feel as though your presence

513
00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:47.280
in the world makes a difference in it. And

514
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.030
again, your presence in the world un under a

515
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.170
certain description. OK. So uh and there are various

516
00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.430
ways in which it does that, right? So uh

517
00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.689
so one of the, the chief uh characteristics of

518
00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:04.250
Christian morality, this notion that every single human being,

519
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:11.329
regardless of origin, regardless of uh circumstance, it has

520
00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:15.209
more status and as such is entitled to uh

521
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:20.319
to respect and consideration. Uh And that's a way

522
00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:25.020
in which uh uh so if you, if you

523
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.630
believe that, then it dispenses you in order to

524
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.300
uh to feel as though your presence in the

525
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.040
world can make a difference and it dispenses you

526
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.869
from having to do anything. OK? Because because you're

527
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.020
entitled to the, the kind of respect and recognition

528
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:44.260
or notice from others uh in virtue of being

529
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.280
who you are not in virtue of your being

530
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.709
able to do something. So if you live in

531
00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:52.780
a, in a culture where where your status is

532
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.760
linked to your, for example, achievement such as for

533
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.319
example, the honor cultures of Ancient Rome, where your,

534
00:31:01.349 --> 00:31:05.849
your, your, your excuse me, your um uh your

535
00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:10.660
immoral status, your honor was linked to your political

536
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.829
and martial prowess. For example, then in order to

537
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.790
in order to have your presence in the world,

538
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.069
make a difference in it. In order to have

539
00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:22.489
to enjoy notice and recognition, you have to do

540
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.160
certain things. But of course, if you're not capable,

541
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.520
if you don't have the capacities, for example, to

542
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.699
uh handle weapons, to be good at fighting and

543
00:31:30.709 --> 00:31:33.119
so on and so forth, then you risk, you

544
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.880
know, being a nobody literally. So one of the

545
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.000
ways in which you can begin to change this,

546
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.959
it's not sufficient, but one of the ways in

547
00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:41.770
which you can begin to change this is by

548
00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.359
changing values and by changing what's counts as worthy

549
00:31:45.369 --> 00:31:46.800
of recognition, for example.

550
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.650
Mhm uh And so could you tell us now

551
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:56.170
about uh the concepts of slave morality and master

552
00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.979
morality as Nietzsche understood them and as Nietzsche used

553
00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:05.329
them and uh how do they apply to an

554
00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:09.689
understanding of Christian morality from his own perspective?

555
00:32:11.719 --> 00:32:18.869
Yeah. So uh so again, those concepts are very

556
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.140
loose in niche and they are, they connect to

557
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:27.930
various things. I think that the, the dominant our

558
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:33.489
strain uh in distinguishing between these two more outlooks

559
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.599
for has to do with the concept of equality.

560
00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:43.099
So he famously describes our master moralities as those

561
00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:45.589
moralities in which as he puts it, there's a

562
00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:50.770
difference in value between human being and human being.

563
00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:53.790
Not everybody is equal, not everybody is the same.

564
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.290
Some people deserve more consideration, more recognition, more notice

565
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.310
than others. Uh Or some people are entitled to

566
00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:06.550
certain privileges to which others are not. Ok. So

567
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.349
uh what he clearly is referring to is, well,

568
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.099
I mean, I'm, I'm no historian of morality, but

569
00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:18.670
I, I would imagine that many, many uh moral

570
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:23.910
outlooks prior to Christianity were probably in egalitarian moral

571
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.770
outlooks were uh for example, slavery was widespread, slavery

572
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.199
was completely normal. And of course, if you, if

573
00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:34.079
you think that some people can be the slaves

574
00:33:34.089 --> 00:33:36.030
of the people, you don't think that every, every

575
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.750
human being by virtue of being a human being

576
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.910
has equal worth. OK. So the, the big innovation

577
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.430
of Christian morality for niche is precisely this idea

578
00:33:46.439 --> 00:33:50.160
that of equality, the idea that all human beings

579
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.739
are, are equal, uh equal worth, basic, equal worth,

580
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.180
which entitles them to respect and consideration, maybe passion

581
00:34:02.189 --> 00:34:04.439
and so on and so forth. Uh And that

582
00:34:04.449 --> 00:34:07.180
goes straight back to the idea that every human

583
00:34:07.189 --> 00:34:10.080
being is a child of God and as such,

584
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.719
uh you know, deserves a kind as a kind

585
00:34:13.728 --> 00:34:17.590
of standing. So that's, I think that's, that's the

586
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.320
crucial thing there. If, if you look closely, there

587
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:27.100
are uh other uh you know, distinctions that you

588
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.589
can draw. So for example, uh I sometimes suspect

589
00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:35.898
that uh the distinction between a master morality, outlook

590
00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:37.708
and a slave morality outlook is the distinction that

591
00:34:37.717 --> 00:34:40.628
we draw today or that sociologist draw today between

592
00:34:40.908 --> 00:34:44.717
what's called a, an honor culture and a dignity

593
00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:51.138
culture. Uh We, and you know, sometimes honor cultures

594
00:34:51.148 --> 00:34:55.478
are hierarchical cultures. There are egalitarian cultures and whereas

595
00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:59.020
dignity, cultures are egalitarian cultures, but there's other distinctions

596
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.629
between honor and dignity, for example, uh dignity, cultures

597
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:06.600
are cultures in which uh you don't have to

598
00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.790
do anything in order to be uh to have

599
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.540
status or standing and to deserve a certain kind

600
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.320
of to have certain rights and certain prerogatives. Whereas

601
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.260
in honor cultures, you have to do something, you

602
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.209
know. So, so honor, unlike dignity is something that

603
00:35:23.219 --> 00:35:26.449
can be lost uh dignity. I mean, you can

604
00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:28.350
behave in any way you want, you can behave

605
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.540
in an undignified manner. It's not going to change

606
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.820
the fact that you have dignity simply by virtue

607
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.979
of being a person. But if you behave dishonorably,

608
00:35:37.229 --> 00:35:40.290
you lose your honor. So there are other distinctions

609
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.409
like that that might operate in the background of

610
00:35:42.419 --> 00:35:44.389
what Nietzsche has in mind. But it's, it's, it's

611
00:35:44.399 --> 00:35:46.750
not easy to tell. So

612
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.860
where do the ideas of good and evil come

613
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.679
from according to Nietzsche?

614
00:35:55.169 --> 00:36:00.379
Well, so, so there was um you know, there

615
00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:05.250
is a distinction between good and bad that predates

616
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.320
the invention of Christian morality, right? So in uh

617
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:12.239
in master moralities, you know, the to be good

618
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.959
is to be like the master and to be

619
00:36:13.969 --> 00:36:16.669
bad is to be like, you know, everybody else

620
00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:20.179
who's not a master. Uh So what's distinctive about

621
00:36:20.189 --> 00:36:22.959
Christian morality is the the switch from that conceptual

622
00:36:22.969 --> 00:36:27.659
pairing, good, bad to good evil. So actually the

623
00:36:27.669 --> 00:36:29.699
question is what, what, what exactly is the difference?

624
00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:33.600
Well, the one chief difference, uh there, there are

625
00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.020
several but one chief difference I think has to

626
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:41.280
do with the importance in the application of the

627
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:44.110
concept of moral evil, of the idea of a

628
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.919
free will. So uh bad in the context of

629
00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:56.479
Christian morality, uh simply refers to uh what's uh

630
00:36:56.729 --> 00:37:00.439
you know, vile, what's ignoble, what's, you know, uh

631
00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:04.550
low and so on and so forth and uh

632
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.699
you know, whether you vile, whether you ignoble is

633
00:37:08.709 --> 00:37:14.229
unrelated to whether or not you are acting freely,

634
00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:18.820
for example, OK. Uh BY contrast, uh when you

635
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:22.449
describe at least in a strict sense, when you

636
00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:27.629
describe uh an action as morally evil, it is

637
00:37:27.879 --> 00:37:32.909
essential that uh you suppose that the person who

638
00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:37.120
perpetrated that action did so freely, uh because if

639
00:37:37.129 --> 00:37:39.149
they are not, if the action was an accident,

640
00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.239
then it may be evil in some sense, it

641
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.510
may be because it had bad consequences for example,

642
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.229
but it's not morally evil. OK. It's only if

643
00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:51.169
you did something uh that is morally wrong on

644
00:37:51.179 --> 00:37:55.760
purpose deliberately, intentionally, if you did it freely, uh

645
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.439
that you can be uh and therefore that you

646
00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:01.219
can be held responsible for it, that the action

647
00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:05.179
counts as morally evil. So that's one important uh

648
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.919
uh distinction, that niche. It was, it was also

649
00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:12.899
these a lot Murkier distinctions between uh uh between

650
00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:15.459
good, bad and good evil. And so, for example,

651
00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:16.679
one of the things that he says is that

652
00:38:16.689 --> 00:38:20.500
the pair good evil, unlike the pair good, bad

653
00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:25.300
begins with uh uh an act of negation, be,

654
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.429
be begins with the invention of evil. So it's

655
00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:32.300
as if you, you first describe some people or

656
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.510
some types of action as evil and then as

657
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.449
an afterthought, what's not like that you characterize as

658
00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:42.949
good. Whereas in so called master moralities, you start

659
00:38:42.959 --> 00:38:45.540
out by asserting something as good and then there's

660
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.770
an afterthought, what's not like that is bad. Uh

661
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.850
Exactly what Nietzsche means by this and he makes

662
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.510
a bit of a big deal out of this

663
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.199
way of carving the distinction in, in the genealogy

664
00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:02.560
is, is a bit unclear. I have some thoughts

665
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.969
about this in the book, but I'm, I'm not

666
00:39:04.979 --> 00:39:12.030
absolutely certain that I have quite understood. Are there's

667
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.020
something interesting going on there, but it's uh again,

668
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.010
I, you know, I'm not there, there are various

669
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.379
ways in which you can understand it

670
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.959
fair enough. Uh And what would you say is

671
00:39:22.969 --> 00:39:27.300
the role that things like guilt and punishment play?

672
00:39:27.679 --> 00:39:32.850
Uh In Nietzsche's account of the genealogy of morality

673
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.780
and perhaps more specifically in Christian morality.

674
00:39:38.179 --> 00:39:41.379
Well, that, that's a, that's a complicated business. Uh

675
00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:46.239
So, uh the genealogy of morality has, is divided

676
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.520
into three essays in the first essay, this is

677
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.649
where he talks most about resentment and the invention

678
00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:55.520
of good and evil, uh, and things of that

679
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.870
nature. And then in the second and the third

680
00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:01.840
essay, the notions of guilt and punishment figure prominently.

681
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.429
I mean, even in the third essay, which is

682
00:40:03.439 --> 00:40:08.110
ostensibly about the invention of ascetic ideals there, he

683
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.110
says that the central acidic practice consists in interpreting

684
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.290
all of your suffering as he puts it under

685
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.419
the perspective of guilt. It is, it's consistent seeing

686
00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:21.719
every, every piece of misfortunes that befalls you every

687
00:40:21.729 --> 00:40:24.429
suffering you have to endure, you have to interpret

688
00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:26.889
it as as punishment for your sins, so to

689
00:40:26.899 --> 00:40:30.860
speak. So, so basically, the third essay really draws

690
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.889
very heavily on what he does on the second

691
00:40:32.899 --> 00:40:35.889
essay. So the two essays together form a kind

692
00:40:35.899 --> 00:40:39.659
of a conceptual whole there. So what's the importance

693
00:40:39.669 --> 00:40:43.149
of all of this? Well, that's, that's our, that

694
00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:46.610
took me some time to try to figure out,

695
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:52.159
right? So one thought uh that I pursued here

696
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.560
is that uh the concept of guilt and the

697
00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.530
concept of responsibility that's tied up to it, maybe

698
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.760
understood uh are in the context of this, the,

699
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.030
the, the attempt to try to satisfy your need

700
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.949
for power. Uh The, the sense that you have

701
00:41:11.959 --> 00:41:15.189
effectiveness as an agent in sort of uh uh

702
00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:19.229
living and making the word reflect your values or

703
00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:23.820
your aspirations. Uh And so the idea is this

704
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.820
right? Uh The idea is that if you do

705
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:32.479
something that falls short of your values, oh, you

706
00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:36.870
could feel ashamed. But if you feel ashamed, uh

707
00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:39.729
one, I mean, the concept of shame is a

708
00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:42.580
notoriously difficult concept, but one way to distinguish between

709
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.540
shame and guilt is this right when you feel

710
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.239
ashamed because you have failed to live up to

711
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.330
your own values. Uh Usually what that means is

712
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.100
that you tried but you, you, you didn't have

713
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.699
what it takes. So your agency lacked effectiveness, you

714
00:41:57.709 --> 00:42:01.419
lacked power in that sense and that's very, very

715
00:42:01.429 --> 00:42:05.739
difficult to accept. Whereas if you feel simply guilty,

716
00:42:06.469 --> 00:42:09.629
then uh it's true that you fail to live

717
00:42:09.639 --> 00:42:13.580
up to your uh to your own values, you

718
00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.810
fail to realize them in the way you live,

719
00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.290
but you could have done otherwise you had the

720
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.639
power to do it. So in this way, feeling

721
00:42:21.649 --> 00:42:26.070
guilty can be uh an a, a defense against

722
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.610
a much more emotionally damaging feeling of shame. Ok.

723
00:42:29.899 --> 00:42:34.139
So, uh by uh inventing the concept of guilt

724
00:42:34.149 --> 00:42:36.919
and then giving it very broad application, you can

725
00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:40.709
see that Christian morality plays a role uh in

726
00:42:40.719 --> 00:42:45.570
this or, or has the function of uh as

727
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.320
it were re restoring or buttressing the feeling of

728
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.739
power of people in whom that fee is, uh

729
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.370
is under threat. Um OK. So that's the first

730
00:42:55.379 --> 00:42:58.360
thought, the, the second thought to come to the

731
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.939
question of punishment. Now, uh the second thought has

732
00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:05.679
to do with which comes with a puzzle. So

733
00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:10.070
the second essay uh is ostensibly devoted to a

734
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.229
genealogy of the feelings of guilt. But the problem

735
00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:17.159
is that in the first essay, Nietzsche already has

736
00:43:17.169 --> 00:43:20.199
given us, has given us a genealogy of guilt,

737
00:43:20.209 --> 00:43:23.239
you know, by giving us a genealogy of uh

738
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.239
what are the norms of guilt? I mean, the

739
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.000
norms that you have to violate in order to

740
00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.189
feel guilty and by giving us a genealogy of

741
00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:33.250
freedom of will cause to feel guilty, you have

742
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.510
to feel as though you're responsible for violating certain

743
00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.979
norms. No niche gives us uh in the first

744
00:43:40.989 --> 00:43:43.280
essay, a genealogy of the freedom of will that

745
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.560
makes you responsible and the gene energy of the

746
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.429
norms, the violation of which would induce guilt. So

747
00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:50.060
it seems like he has not already give us

748
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:52.350
the gene of guilt. So what is he doing

749
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.090
then? In the second essay, that's different from the

750
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.169
first. But in the second essay, what Nietzsche does

751
00:43:57.179 --> 00:43:59.310
is that he pursues a very different line about

752
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.860
guilt. And the line that he pursues has to

753
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.610
do with the association that even we draw between

754
00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:10.550
uh between guilt and indebtedness. So we, we talk,

755
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.629
for example, about uh being punished for our sins

756
00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:20.060
as a way of paying our debts. So, so

757
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.080
there's a connection there which in German is actually

758
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:27.199
uh are very strong because the same word should,

759
00:44:27.209 --> 00:44:30.419
can be translated as guilt and has indebtedness or

760
00:44:30.429 --> 00:44:33.469
that in any event. Uh So he's very interested

761
00:44:33.479 --> 00:44:35.830
in this connection. And the reason why he's interested

762
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.780
in the connection is because he's interested in a

763
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.870
particular way in which guilt and punishment can be

764
00:44:40.879 --> 00:44:46.310
related. Uh So typically when we think of punishment,

765
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.679
I think we tend to think of it in

766
00:44:47.689 --> 00:44:52.570
retributive terms. OK. So you did something wrong. I

767
00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.949
punish you and my punishing you is retribution in

768
00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:56.340
the sense that all I'm trying to do is

769
00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.750
to get you what you deserve to make sure

770
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.600
you don't get away with it. That's it. But

771
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.620
if you think of punishment as retribution, it does

772
00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:08.169
not undo the guilt. You know, it doesn't wash

773
00:45:08.179 --> 00:45:12.270
away the guilt, so to speak. But, and this

774
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.479
is especially true Christianity. There's a way in which

775
00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:17.350
punishment can wash away the guilt. And then the

776
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.979
question is, well, how could that be possible? But

777
00:45:19.989 --> 00:45:24.280
if you think about guilt as indebtedness and you

778
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.479
think of punishment as an alternative way of paying

779
00:45:27.489 --> 00:45:30.340
your debt, then you can see how punishment could

780
00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.870
wash away the guilt. And this is the line

781
00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:35.739
that Nietzsche explores in that, in that second essay,

782
00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.850
you know, so, so sometimes you can fail to

783
00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.050
live up to your own values. And of course,

784
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.929
that, you know, that shows that, you know, you,

785
00:45:44.939 --> 00:45:47.570
you, you maybe you don't have what it takes

786
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.020
to live up to the values. It raises that

787
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.850
question. But if it turns out that you, you

788
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.800
can somehow demonstrate that you have the capacity to

789
00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.520
live up to those values, for example, by undergoing

790
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.379
the kind of deprivation that living up to the

791
00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:05.469
values requires of you in the form of punishment

792
00:46:05.479 --> 00:46:09.270
or penance. Then it, it reassures you with regard

793
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.689
to your power. And I think that this is

794
00:46:10.699 --> 00:46:12.229
the line that Nietzsche is pursuing.

795
00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:17.739
So before we get into the will to nothingness

796
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:21.340
itself, that gives title to your book, let me

797
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.239
just ask you about another topic. So what are

798
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.389
Nietzsche's thoughts on aestheticism?

799
00:46:30.959 --> 00:46:38.939
So, one of the striking features of Christian morality

800
00:46:38.949 --> 00:46:43.000
and even the secular variants of Christian morality that

801
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.040
were developed in the enlightenment and they're a roughly

802
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.840
defined moral look with which we at least in

803
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:53.659
the Western world live these days. Uh IS that

804
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:58.580
to act morally, is not necessarily good for you.

805
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:03.699
OK? To act morally. Uh You may have to

806
00:47:03.709 --> 00:47:05.649
uh to do things that are not in your

807
00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:08.489
best interest, you may have to do to uh

808
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.560
undergo uh or you may have to do things

809
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.050
that are going to harm you that are going

810
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.879
to be bad for you in that sense. Uh

811
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.780
That's uh it's a new idea. I mean, for

812
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.580
the Ancient Greeks, for example, it's very striking that

813
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.419
uh the reasons to act in ways that they

814
00:47:26.429 --> 00:47:29.379
consider more to act virtuously is that it's good

815
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:33.590
for you? Ok. So in Aristotle and virtue, ethics

816
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.199
is like that, you know, why should I, you

817
00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:38.610
know, uh, be good to my friends, for example,

818
00:47:38.709 --> 00:47:41.649
why should I treat other people with, in, in

819
00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:43.810
the ways that I'm, you know, that the morality

820
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.909
requires me to treat them, not because it's good

821
00:47:48.919 --> 00:47:51.379
for you. That's, that's, that's the answer. Ok? But

822
00:47:51.389 --> 00:47:54.350
it's not the case in uh uh in modern

823
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.879
morality, in modern morality, you know, morality requires me

824
00:47:57.889 --> 00:47:59.919
to do things that are going to go against,

825
00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:02.760
against my interests that are going to be bad

826
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.310
for me. And Nietzsche finds the origin of this

827
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.929
in, in Christian morality. Ok. Now, so there's a,

828
00:48:09.939 --> 00:48:14.929
a kind of a building asceticism in the modern

829
00:48:14.939 --> 00:48:18.459
moral outlook that grew out of Christian morality. Now,

830
00:48:18.469 --> 00:48:21.229
of course, in the modern moral outlook that, that

831
00:48:21.239 --> 00:48:24.070
uh asceticism is fairly attenuated. I mean, the modern

832
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.479
morality doesn't say, look, you should, you should give

833
00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:28.520
up on your happiness, you should go against what's

834
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.330
good for you. You should go against your well

835
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.360
being, uh uh if you want in order to

836
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.300
be more, no, it says that no, you can,

837
00:48:35.469 --> 00:48:37.479
you can pursue your well being, you can pursue

838
00:48:37.489 --> 00:48:40.459
your happiness, but only within the limits that are

839
00:48:40.469 --> 00:48:44.350
placed upon it, upon that pursuit by morality. So

840
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.379
there's going, there might be occasions in your life

841
00:48:47.389 --> 00:48:49.320
where you have to choose between what's good for

842
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:52.159
you and what's morally. Right? Ok. So that can

843
00:48:52.169 --> 00:48:54.540
happen. That's the way, that's the extent of the

844
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.669
asceticism. Uh, IN modern morality. Ok. There might be

845
00:48:57.679 --> 00:49:00.399
circum, I mean, of course, in extreme circumstances, it

846
00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:02.949
may mean your death. I mean, sometimes morality requires

847
00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:06.100
you to sacrifice yourself, not, not just your being,

848
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.870
but your life for a moral cause of some

849
00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.699
kind. All right. Now, there are many examples like

850
00:49:11.709 --> 00:49:15.850
this. But in Christian morality, the asceticism is not

851
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.510
so attenuated. Ok? In Christian morality, you're being told

852
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.080
that what it is to be more, what it

853
00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:24.979
is to be good is just is to turn

854
00:49:24.989 --> 00:49:29.689
your back on your prosperity, your well being, your

855
00:49:29.699 --> 00:49:32.699
flourishing, at least as a member of the natural

856
00:49:32.709 --> 00:49:35.850
world. OK. So what it is for me to

857
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.909
be moral in the terms of Christian morality as

858
00:49:37.919 --> 00:49:40.399
Nietzsche understands it is to turn my back on

859
00:49:40.409 --> 00:49:43.520
the, on the natural world completely and on myself

860
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:45.600
as a member of the natural world. So I

861
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.850
have to give up uh uh on what he

862
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.600
calls in the genealogy uh physiological, which is another

863
00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.600
way in uh in German to say natural well

864
00:49:55.610 --> 00:50:01.239
being. Uh So my well being is an embodied

865
00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.899
uh individual with the kinds of uh needs, including

866
00:50:06.909 --> 00:50:09.550
psychological and emotional needs that are characteristic of an

867
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.050
embodied being. I have to turn my back on

868
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:15.699
all of this. Uh That's what asceticism is? That's

869
00:50:15.709 --> 00:50:18.780
the kind of asceticism that Nietzsche targets in the

870
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.100
toy of the genealogy.

871
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.199
So, getting into the final topic of our conversation

872
00:50:25.209 --> 00:50:29.239
today, what is then the will to nothingness and

873
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.870
where does it stem from?

874
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:39.860
Well, so we will do nothing less. Uh, IS

875
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:44.510
a, is a phrase that Nietzsche introduces in the

876
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.580
final essay of the genealogy. He mentions it in

877
00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.409
the first section of the essay and then in

878
00:50:50.419 --> 00:50:54.030
the final concluding section of the essay where, and

879
00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:58.320
he says in both cases that uh uh it's

880
00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.330
better to will, nothing less than not to will

881
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.850
at all. And so clearly, what he has in

882
00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:09.040
mind is the role that uh the endorsement of

883
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:15.580
Christian morality can play in uh warning off against

884
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:19.459
nihilism where Nihilism is the condition of not willing,

885
00:51:20.489 --> 00:51:25.500
where uh the what motivates not willing is uh

886
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.929
is the fact that it seems pointless to you

887
00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:31.090
to will anything you go. And it can be

888
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.040
pointless either because you can identify nothing worth willing

889
00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:39.830
or even if you can identify something worth willing.

890
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.810
As I argued in my first book, if you

891
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.090
don't have what it takes to achieve what's worth

892
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.189
willing, then what's the point of willing it anyway,

893
00:51:46.199 --> 00:51:49.260
if you can, if you can get there. And

894
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:53.179
so he, he, he thinks that uh Christian morality,

895
00:51:53.199 --> 00:51:56.419
you know, is one of the functions of Christian

896
00:51:56.429 --> 00:51:59.149
morality is to stave off that kind of uh

897
00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:03.199
nihilistic. What he calls suicidal nihilism. So, to that

898
00:52:03.209 --> 00:52:06.199
extent, Christian morality is an instrument of self preservation.

899
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.310
But Christian morality does that in a way that's

900
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.909
going to prove to be very costly. So it's

901
00:52:13.919 --> 00:52:15.689
trying to stave off nihilism. But in a way

902
00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:19.620
that eventually, you know, uh uh fails is self

903
00:52:19.639 --> 00:52:22.590
defeating in that way. And that's why I think

904
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.419
he calls it a will to nothingness. So I,

905
00:52:25.429 --> 00:52:27.189
I don't think that what he means is that,

906
00:52:27.419 --> 00:52:30.139
you know, the Christians want nothing less as, as

907
00:52:30.149 --> 00:52:33.389
such, but what they want the way in which

908
00:52:33.399 --> 00:52:36.780
they go about willing ends up being a will

909
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:38.889
to nothing that because it's a way of willing,

910
00:52:38.899 --> 00:52:42.530
it's a way of engaging in your life that

911
00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.919
turns out to uh that, that gives set yourself

912
00:52:46.929 --> 00:52:49.360
a kind of an objective that uh but does

913
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.860
so in a way that proves to be self

914
00:52:50.879 --> 00:52:53.070
defeating in the, in the end of the day,

915
00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.620
that's why it ends in nothing that anyway, you

916
00:52:55.629 --> 00:52:58.669
try to, to keep nothing that away, but in

917
00:52:58.679 --> 00:53:01.429
a way that makes it unavoidable for you.

918
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.189
So is this will to nothingness, a moral outlook

919
00:53:07.199 --> 00:53:08.729
itself or not?

920
00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:12.919
Well, it's, it's uh so to say that uh

921
00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:17.500
Christian, the Christian moral outlook uh is expresses a

922
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:21.979
will to nothingness is basically the central critical claim

923
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.030
that Nietzsche makes, right? So the, the Christian moral

924
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.159
outlook as a certain function, but the way in

925
00:53:28.169 --> 00:53:32.340
which it fulfills that function proves to be self

926
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.669
defeating or self undermining. Uh So the function is

927
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.709
broadly speaking, uh to restore their feeling of power

928
00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:47.399
to people whose, in, in whom the whose weakness

929
00:53:47.409 --> 00:53:51.100
has exposed them to it. But it does. So

930
00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:56.110
in a way that uh by depleting our, the

931
00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:02.189
strength of that individual makes them in the long

932
00:54:02.199 --> 00:54:07.659
run, are unable to uh to maintain that feeling

933
00:54:07.669 --> 00:54:10.350
of power, makes them unable to do the kinds

934
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.350
of things that would make it the case, that

935
00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.120
their presence in the world makes a difference in

936
00:54:15.129 --> 00:54:18.840
it. Uh Which is why I argue that uh

937
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.040
you know, especially this is especially true of the

938
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:25.639
asceticism that Nietzsche advocates that this asceticism turns out

939
00:54:25.649 --> 00:54:27.610
to be a pyrrhic victory. Because uh you know,

940
00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:31.129
if you uh uh if, if you believe that

941
00:54:31.139 --> 00:54:36.590
you can achieve natural well being, then repudiating national

942
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.189
well uh natural well being is claiming that it

943
00:54:39.199 --> 00:54:43.399
has no value makes you uh has the benefit

944
00:54:43.409 --> 00:54:45.500
that you don't have to feel like you are

945
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:48.280
impotent or incompetent for your failure to achieve that

946
00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:52.110
kind of well being. But then the problem is

947
00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.739
that if you want to subscribe, continue subscribing to

948
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.659
the acidic ideal, you have to deprive yourself in

949
00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:59.959
ways that are going to weaken you even further.

950
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.550
Which is why Nietzsche says that the Christian morality,

951
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.610
Christian asceticism in particular addresses a sickness, the sickness

952
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.250
that's caused by the weakness that makes it very

953
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.239
difficult for you to uh to make it the

954
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.820
case that your presence in the world makes a

955
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:16.979
difference in it. It addresses that weakness, it addresses

956
00:55:16.989 --> 00:55:19.399
only the symptoms of the weakness, not the cold,

957
00:55:19.409 --> 00:55:21.800
the cause being the weakness. And in fact, what

958
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.790
it does is that it, it further it, it,

959
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.699
it, it exacerbates the weakness instead of eliminating it,

960
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.770
ensuring that in the long run, you will find

961
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.320
yourself completely incapable of making it the case that

962
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.439
your presence in the world makes a difference. So,

963
00:55:37.449 --> 00:55:40.050
so I used the uh so I used two

964
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.520
analogies that might be helpful here. One is uh

965
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:46.629
uh the analogy of a Pyrrhic victory. So ps

966
00:55:46.639 --> 00:55:50.409
was this famous uh general who won uh victories,

967
00:55:50.419 --> 00:55:52.429
but at great cost to his army. So it

968
00:55:52.439 --> 00:55:54.350
was a victory, all right, he defeated the opposite

969
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.989
army, but he came out of that defeat, having

970
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.750
no army himself. So, so that if he were

971
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.969
to face another threat again, he would be unable

972
00:56:01.979 --> 00:56:05.229
to meet it. Uh So if for a moment

973
00:56:05.739 --> 00:56:07.939
manages to do what he needs to do, to

974
00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:10.870
establish security, to establish his power. But at the

975
00:56:10.879 --> 00:56:12.770
cost of being able to do it, you know,

976
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.739
uh in the long run. So that's why it's

977
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.949
a process that's ultimately self undermining the other analogy

978
00:56:17.959 --> 00:56:20.790
that I use, uh which is quite a, a

979
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:24.429
uh applicable actually is an analogy with a uh

980
00:56:24.439 --> 00:56:28.719
a particular way of understanding the phenomenon of anorexia

981
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:32.679
uh by uh at least in, in certain strains

982
00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.629
of psychoanalytic theory. So the anorexic gives up on

983
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.590
the desire for food. They claim that feeding myself

984
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.949
is not important. And it turns out that the

985
00:56:41.959 --> 00:56:44.780
motivation very often it has to do with power

986
00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.330
and independence. You know. So there are going to

987
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.419
be cases where the anorexic refuses to eat because

988
00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:57.760
for example, there caregivers use the, the act of

989
00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:01.389
feeding them as an opportunity for them, The caregivers

990
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.159
to demonstrate to the, to the anorexic him or

991
00:57:05.169 --> 00:57:08.219
herself uh that they have power over them that

992
00:57:08.229 --> 00:57:10.610
they are that the anorexic is dependent on them

993
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.679
and so on and so forth. So that uh

994
00:57:12.689 --> 00:57:14.979
the anorexic might decide that well, if I want

995
00:57:14.989 --> 00:57:18.620
to, to assert my power and my independence, I

996
00:57:18.629 --> 00:57:24.080
have to give up on the desires that make

997
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.330
me dependent, that make me more or less. And

998
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.669
so you can see how in some sense they

999
00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:33.669
do by uh disa avoiding those desires or by

1000
00:57:33.679 --> 00:57:37.550
devaluing those desires, they do achieve a measure of

1001
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.149
power and independence, but you can also see what

1002
00:57:40.159 --> 00:57:41.159
the cost is for it.

1003
00:57:43.729 --> 00:57:47.189
Great. So uh the book is again, the Will

1004
00:57:47.199 --> 00:57:51.449
To Nothingness, an essay on niches on the genealogy

1005
00:57:51.459 --> 00:57:53.840
of morality. I'm leaving a link to it in

1006
00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:57.669
the description box of this interview. And Doctor Regin,

1007
00:57:57.929 --> 00:58:00.800
would you like to tell people where they can

1008
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.510
find you and your work on the internet?

1009
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.340
Well, I mean, the best place to to go

1010
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.530
uh such as it is, is probably the website

1011
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:14.159
uh of uh the philosophy department at Broad University

1012
00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:19.479
where I have a research page uh which is

1013
00:58:19.489 --> 00:58:22.500
always in need of, of updating and improvement. But

1014
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:24.530
I hope to be able to do this sometimes

1015
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.760
over the course of the summer.

1016
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.080
