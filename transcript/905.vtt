00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.609
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:04.750
the, the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo

3
00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.230
Lops. And today I'm joined by Doctor David.

4
00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.419
David Pins off. He's a research scientist at UCL

5
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.839
, a, the University of California, Los Angeles

6
00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.309
. And his research focuses on evolutionary psychology, political

7
00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:23.530
psychology, public opinion and sexual behavior. And today

8
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.089
we're focusing mostly on political belief systems, the meaning

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.319
of life, morality and some other related topics.

10
00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.990
So David, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.969
big pleasure to everyone. The pleasure is all mine

12
00:00:36.978 --> 00:00:38.700
, Ricardo, I'm a big fan of the podcast

13
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:40.579
and I'm very happy to be on it. Great

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.098
. Thanks. So, starting with the fun stuff

15
00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.978
, let's talk about political belief systems then. So

16
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.978
, I mean, I guess that uh if you

17
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.118
talk with political scientists and philosophers, uh when it

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.848
comes to explaining how political belief systems work, where

19
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.650
they come from, they would give you a,

20
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.739
I don't know, a highly intellectualized version of it

21
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.528
based on abstract values and how they are so coherent

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.469
and so on. But since you come from an

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.379
evolutionary psychology perspective, how do you approach it?

24
00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:26.260
Exactly. Yeah. So um I have a kind

25
00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.879
of cheeky blog called Everything Is Bullshit. Uh And

26
00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:32.189
part of the shtick there is to call bullshit on

27
00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:36.219
things. And um you could describe my academic paper

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.109
, uh strange bedfellows, the alliance theory of,

29
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.338
of political belief systems as a way of calling bullshit

30
00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.650
on that prevailing view of political ideology. So,

31
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230
um I really take aim at the idea that uh

32
00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.418
liberalism or conservatism as they manifest in contemporary American society

33
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.939
or other Western nations uh represent uh coherent belief systems

34
00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:01.659
, reflect moral principles, reflect well thought out philosophies

35
00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.400
. Um I think they are much more strategic uh

36
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.020
chaotic random uh than, than that. Um And

37
00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:13.639
I'd be happy to get into the details of,

38
00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.008
of uh how I'm grounding out that view. OK

39
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.008
. So, uh but just before we get into

40
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.250
your view and start exploring it, what would you

41
00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:28.229
say are some of the most common explanations that people

42
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.689
bring to the table when trying to explain where political

43
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.169
belief systems come from? Yeah. So I'd say

44
00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.349
broadly speaking, the most common approach to political belief

45
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.830
systems is to point to some essential difference between people

46
00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:47.008
on either side of the political spectrum. Um So

47
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.330
maybe that essential difference has to do with one's personality

48
00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:58.250
or one's psychological dispositions. Uh one's uh traits,

49
00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:02.028
one's um uh personal idiosyncrasies and quirks the way one

50
00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:06.849
sees the world. Um And that's one common way

51
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.349
of, of looking at it. Um The other

52
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.099
way of looking at it uh is to say that

53
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.469
they, they really pertain to differences in moral values

54
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.528
. So, one of the most prominent approaches in

55
00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:20.639
this area is Jonathan Heights Moral Foundations theory, which

56
00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.149
says that liberals and conservatives uh rely on different moral

57
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.979
foundations that is uh have a monomaniac egalitarian and harm

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.610
focused uh ideology. Whereas conservatives uh rely on all

59
00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:39.599
six moral foundations from uh in group out group psychology

60
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.159
to uh to uh purity and authority. Um And

61
00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.990
roughly, I think a lot of people in political

62
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.449
psychology would agree that there are deep seated moral differences

63
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.159
between liberals and conservatives. Republicans and Democrats, left

64
00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.849
wing, left wing, right wing uh et cetera

65
00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.080
. Uh And uh and, and it's those abstract

66
00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:09.300
moral values that color and explain uh the contents of

67
00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:11.538
our political belief systems. They are the common thread

68
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.199
that ties all our beliefs together. Uh And I

69
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.358
think that is mistaken and what would you say are

70
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:20.350
some of the biggest weaknesses, at least in your

71
00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:26.670
view when it comes to hypotheses that are based on

72
00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:29.959
or try to explain political belief systems on the basis

73
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.588
of abstract values. Because I mean, it seems

74
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.689
to me that sometimes people are trying to talk about

75
00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:41.809
abstract values and not necessarily just moral values, but

76
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.670
some other sorts of political values uh as if they

77
00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:51.100
were like sort of separate from the rest of our

78
00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:59.379
psychology and based on just pure rational philosophy or something

79
00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.829
like that. So, what are your thoughts on

80
00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:03.439
that. Sure. Yeah. Um I think the

81
00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.588
biggest problem with that view is that it's just fundamentally

82
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.189
evolutionarily implausible. So if you, if you,

83
00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.790
if you actually look at what people who believe in

84
00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.649
these abstract values are saying, uh usually what they're

85
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.389
saying is that these values are not self interested,

86
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.720
they're not helping a person advance their power or status

87
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.209
or access to resources. They're not in the interests

88
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.540
of one's self or one's kin. Uh But they're

89
00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:30.869
also not group interested either. Um Because if they

90
00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.170
were, then we would strategically endorse whatever values support

91
00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:38.178
our political allies and reject them or flout them when

92
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.588
they serve the interests of our political rivals. And

93
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.309
when we have a wide variety of heterogeneous political allies

94
00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.428
, as we do uh in uh modern democracies with

95
00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.778
complex political coalitions, then we're going to see uh

96
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.220
the strategic endorsement of moral values in one case to

97
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.790
support one's allies and the rejection of that moral value

98
00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.119
uh when it happens to support our rivals. And

99
00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.338
so that is basically identical to alliance theory that these

100
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.720
values are not really held consistently, but are used

101
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.369
strategically to support the interests of one's allies and oppose

102
00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.649
the interests of one's rivals. But the problem is

103
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.809
if these abstract values are not in our self interest

104
00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.939
and they're not in our political allies, interests or

105
00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.608
our group's interests, then that really rules out the

106
00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.608
only possible mechanisms by which these values could have evolved

107
00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.838
, uh you know, Darwin once famously said that

108
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.709
um um something along the lines of uh uh things

109
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.209
don't exist merely for the sake of beauty or for

110
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.670
the sake of mere variety. Um They don't exist

111
00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:43.170
to delight man or the creator, right? And

112
00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:45.309
if, and if you could show that that uh

113
00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.778
the properties of an animal exhibited these uh benevolent properties

114
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.528
, uh then that would be absolutely fatal to the

115
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.108
theory of evolution. And I think a lot of

116
00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:58.738
people in political psychology are taking that kind of evolutionarily

117
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.988
implausible view that we have these high minded values that

118
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.470
are nobly designed to make the world a better place

119
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.608
. But that's just not the kind of thing that

120
00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:09.048
can evolve by natural selection. And so I think

121
00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.540
we actually need to get a bit more cynical about

122
00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:14.389
our uh supposed moral values in the same way that

123
00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.738
we're cynical about the mission statements and N pr campaigns

124
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.309
of big corporations. I don't think anyone thinks that

125
00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:26.379
Starbucks is actual goal is to uh uh nourish and

126
00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.459
inspire the human spirit, as it says on their

127
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.709
website. I think most people went trying to predict

128
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.579
what Starbucks is going to do next, uh are

129
00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:36.869
going to ask themselves what, what will make Starbucks

130
00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:39.619
the most money. And I think we need to

131
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:41.778
view humans in a similar way. I think we

132
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.869
need to view the quote unquote mission statements of design

133
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.470
to mobilize supporters. Uh and they, uh,

134
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.629
we, we really have no reason to think that

135
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:53.338
they, they represent nobly designed impartially, altruistic,

136
00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.629
uh, world views. I think that's fundamentally,

137
00:07:55.639 --> 00:08:01.088
uh evolutionarily and functionally implausible. And a very interesting

138
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:07.809
question here is if people's political beliefs are even consistent

139
00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:09.790
, there is, and of course, that might

140
00:08:09.798 --> 00:08:11.309
mean different things. But I guess that what people

141
00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:15.100
mean by consistent theory is that, for example,

142
00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:18.709
if someone say, says they are from the left

143
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.184
or from the right, or a Republican, a

144
00:08:22.194 --> 00:08:24.824
democrat or libertarian, an a, an authoritarian or

145
00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:28.634
something like that, that uh there's sort of a

146
00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:33.815
, a checklist and they check all the points when

147
00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:37.744
it comes to the political beliefs that you usually associate

148
00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:43.070
with either side of the political spectrum. But uh

149
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.469
I mean, there, there are, I guess

150
00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:48.109
very good criticisms of that, for example, back

151
00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:52.418
in 2018, I interviewed Robert Kurzban and he has

152
00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:56.908
a very good book about that and the sort of

153
00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:01.639
shows I think to some extent that people are not

154
00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.469
really consistent, at least if we look at things

155
00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:09.869
from, uh I mean, expecting that people again

156
00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:13.080
, check all of the boxes when it comes to

157
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:18.090
a particular political ideology. And there are things that

158
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.119
perhaps even if I, for example, identify as

159
00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:24.869
a Republican, I might agree with some points on

160
00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.739
some points with the Democrats and vice versa. So

161
00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:35.399
are people's political beliefs really consistent or not? Yeah

162
00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:37.428
. Um So it's, it's a complicated question and

163
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.479
that, I think the way that a lot of

164
00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:45.928
political scientists think about consistency is misguided. Um So

165
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.570
a lot of political scientists will think that, you

166
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.710
know, if you support, um, say,

167
00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:54.678
uh you know, a Christian fundamentalist morality, you

168
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.440
know, uh anti aora uh anti recreational drugs,

169
00:09:58.808 --> 00:10:01.788
um, anti gay rights. And you also endorse

170
00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:05.619
free market libertarianism that, that is a consistent moral

171
00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:09.349
philosophy. Uh And if you, in so far

172
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.769
as you deviate from that, then you're inconsistent.

173
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.200
Um And I think that is just a very wrong

174
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.090
headed way of thinking about what it means to be

175
00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:18.500
consistent. I think we should define consistency in the

176
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:22.928
straightforward way of having beliefs that fit together coherently.

177
00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.719
Um And if you actually look at the combination of

178
00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:28.038
Christian fundamentalism and, and free market libertarianism, there's

179
00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:31.080
actually nothing consistent about it at all. Um The

180
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.678
only reason these philosophies go together in the United States

181
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.719
is because of a historically contingent political alliance that arose

182
00:10:37.729 --> 00:10:41.144
in uh starting in the 19 seventies between wealthy business

183
00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:45.663
people and uh pro-life evangelicals. And that alliance does

184
00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:48.094
not exist in many other countries. In fact,

185
00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:50.923
in other countries, you see free market libertarianism being

186
00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:54.625
combined with um with more, more secular ideology,

187
00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:58.364
with, with um with being pro choice. Um

188
00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:01.163
And so this peculiar alliance that exists in the United

189
00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:03.504
States is not a reflection of some deep, you

190
00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:05.254
know, feature of human nature that, that,

191
00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.673
that these issues have to go together. Uh I

192
00:11:07.683 --> 00:11:11.548
think they are much more historically contingent uh and arbitrary

193
00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:13.700
than we like to think. Um And so I

194
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.788
don't think that uh political belief systems are consistent in

195
00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:20.178
the sense of reflecting coherent philosophies or consistently held moral

196
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.649
principles. And I go through a lot of examples

197
00:11:22.658 --> 00:11:26.808
in the paper of, of ideological inconsistencies that are

198
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.038
really hard to explain from that perspective, but easy

199
00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:33.168
to explain from my perspective. OK. But wait

200
00:11:33.178 --> 00:11:35.009
a minute, because at this point, someone might

201
00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:39.119
come in and say, ok, but perhaps that's

202
00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:41.570
true for just the general population. I mean,

203
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:48.210
the average citizen, the average voter is ignorant is

204
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:52.070
ill informed. They don't inform themselves about the politics

205
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.139
, about the political philosophy, the political science,

206
00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:58.889
they don't read blah, blah blah. And so

207
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:03.428
that's the main reason why they say they are,

208
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.320
for example, on the right, but they have

209
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:09.788
inconsistent beliefs, they might believe in some things that

210
00:12:09.798 --> 00:12:13.710
are mostly associated with the left and so on and

211
00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:16.548
vice versa as well. But what about the,

212
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.859
let's call them political elites. And that would include

213
00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:24.048
, of course, the more let's say, educated

214
00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:30.250
people, the people who actually read the political philosophy

215
00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.509
, the political science and they want to try to

216
00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.869
be or they say they want to try to be

217
00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:41.840
as consistent as possible. Uh And they are constantly

218
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:46.960
informing themselves on the politics, what's happening and so

219
00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.729
on the political alliances and all of that. Uh

220
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:56.629
I mean, our political elites, the more educated

221
00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:01.048
people, the more informed people, more consistent than

222
00:13:01.058 --> 00:13:05.678
just the general population. Yeah. So that's generally

223
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.479
the standard view in political science, which is that

224
00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:13.009
the, the masses are, are generally um uninformed

225
00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:13.080
or, or at the very least, not as

226
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.989
, as well informed as their elite counterparts. Uh

227
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.149
And they, they don't, they sort of lack

228
00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:22.489
quote unquote ideological consistency. Uh And the dominant explanation

229
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.219
for, for, um mass opinion is that it's

230
00:13:26.229 --> 00:13:31.548
group centric that is, it's rooted in uh sort

231
00:13:31.558 --> 00:13:35.408
of uh group attachments, group prejudices, group allegiances

232
00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:39.080
, you know, and their policy preferences really depend

233
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.844
on, you know, whether the policy is in

234
00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:43.205
groups they like or groups they don't like. And

235
00:13:43.215 --> 00:13:46.004
if it's benefiting a group, they like, then

236
00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:46.614
they like the policy. And if it's benefiting a

237
00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.125
group, they don't like, then they don't like

238
00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:52.254
it. And that's really the dominant approach to explaining

239
00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:56.014
uh the uh political beliefs of the mass public.

240
00:13:56.114 --> 00:13:58.585
Uh And what's interesting is that the group attitudes of

241
00:13:58.594 --> 00:14:01.783
the mass public aren't, do, not necessarily align

242
00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:03.984
with the group attitudes of political elites that is they're

243
00:14:03.994 --> 00:14:09.859
much more chaotic and unpredictable. Um What I want

244
00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:13.219
to argue is that the political beliefs of elites are

245
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:16.048
, in fact, just as group centric as the

246
00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:20.500
political beliefs of the mass public. It is just

247
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:22.979
that there that the groups around which they center uh

248
00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:28.750
are a different set of groups uh and the uh

249
00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:33.918
and the beliefs might be a more sophisticated set of

250
00:14:33.928 --> 00:14:37.330
rationalizations, befitting of, of more intelligent, highly

251
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.320
educated people. Um But that's really the only difference

252
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.529
that is, you see these complex political coalitions and

253
00:14:43.538 --> 00:14:46.298
alliances and the most politically informed people are most attentive

254
00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:48.719
to the details of those political coalitions and are most

255
00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:52.408
willing to align themselves with those coalitions and accommodate new

256
00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:56.840
alliances and oppose the enemy of their enemy and befriend

257
00:14:56.849 --> 00:15:01.639
the ally of their ally. Uh And that kind

258
00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:03.379
of loyalty and engagement is what ultimately drives their beliefs

259
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:05.769
, their loyalty to the coalition as a whole,

260
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:11.408
not any kind of uh abstract philosophizing. Usually the

261
00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:16.269
abstract philosophy comes as a justification or rationalization for whatever

262
00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:20.200
serves the interests of their political coalition. So we've

263
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:26.418
been focusing mostly on people here but uh talking about

264
00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:30.119
the belief systems themselves. And of course, here

265
00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:33.750
again, we are coming from the presupposition that there

266
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:41.259
is a pure ideological belief system from any sort of

267
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:45.989
ideology here, which is also something uh questionable or

268
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.969
debatable. But uh are even the belief systems,

269
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:52.979
them themselves coherent because someone might say, oh OK

270
00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:56.229
, so you're saying or earlier, you talked about

271
00:15:56.239 --> 00:16:02.298
the example of some ideological inconsistencies when it comes to

272
00:16:02.349 --> 00:16:06.288
, for example, uh rep Republicans in the US

273
00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.418
. But people might say, OK, but that's

274
00:16:07.428 --> 00:16:14.418
just a silly historical accident, but they are still

275
00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:21.119
uh pure uh right wing ideology out there somewhere.

276
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.219
And when you look at it and if you're careful

277
00:16:25.229 --> 00:16:27.418
, you can see that it's really coherent. But

278
00:16:27.428 --> 00:16:30.690
is that really the case? Yeah. So I

279
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.239
think it's not the case and you could go through

280
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.580
any feature you want to identify with, say right

281
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.548
wing ideology or left wing ideology. Um I go

282
00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:44.788
through three different proposed features in, in the paper

283
00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:48.750
, um equality, authority and tolerance. And I

284
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:51.529
go through each feature and show how uh the uh

285
00:16:51.538 --> 00:16:55.840
apparent uh moral principle or moral moral value is actually

286
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:59.700
not held consistently. And it's only uh brought forward

287
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.940
when it's in the interests of one's political allies and

288
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.150
it is flouted and rejected when it happens to benefit

289
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.847
other groups, uh especially one's political rivals. Um

290
00:17:10.858 --> 00:17:12.368
So to take an example from the equality domain,

291
00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:17.890
um liberals think it is unfair that corporate CEO S

292
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.380
uh make millions of dollars a year, but they

293
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.529
actually think it's, uh it's fair for Hollywood movie

294
00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:26.229
stars to make millions of dollars a year. Um

295
00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:26.678
And so that would be an example of the type

296
00:17:26.688 --> 00:17:30.509
of ideological inconsistency I'm talking about, especially when you

297
00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:33.269
consider the fact that corporate CEO S are widely associated

298
00:17:33.278 --> 00:17:36.999
with conservatives and Hollywood movie stars are widely associated with

299
00:17:37.009 --> 00:17:38.057
liberals. And what's interesting is that, uh you

300
00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:41.958
actually see the reversal among conservatives, conservatives actually think

301
00:17:41.968 --> 00:17:45.057
that it's unfair for Hollywood movie stars to make millions

302
00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:47.208
of dollars a year. And so as soon as

303
00:17:47.218 --> 00:17:51.199
you swap in different groups that people feel allegiance or

304
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:53.779
rivalry towards. You see their supposed principles shift and

305
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:56.979
change flexibly. Another example from the equality domain,

306
00:17:56.989 --> 00:18:00.549
we like to think that conservatives don't care about disadvantaged

307
00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:03.699
groups. But when you say, should the government

308
00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:06.890
do more to help small working class towns in America's

309
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.279
Heartland? That is very much a right wing coded

310
00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:11.930
group and a majority of conservatives say yes, the

311
00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:12.890
government should do more to help them. So it's

312
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.529
really not a matter of being in favor of quality

313
00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:19.088
of equality or inequality in the abstract or in general

314
00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.920
, it's really being strategically in favor of it uh

315
00:18:22.939 --> 00:18:26.858
when it favors the interests of one of one's allies

316
00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:30.489
and being strategically against it when it favors the interests

317
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:33.098
of one's rivals. And I'm happy to go through

318
00:18:33.108 --> 00:18:37.059
some of the other um supposed principles as well if

319
00:18:37.068 --> 00:18:37.880
you'd like me to. Oh yeah, sure.

320
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.900
I mean, I was just about to ask you

321
00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:45.588
because there's this idea that whatever sort of principles are

322
00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:48.989
part of a specific political ideology. I mean,

323
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.660
the ideology itself derives from supposed first principles. That

324
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.239
is something that philosophers, for example, talk a

325
00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.709
lot about. And in this particular case, I

326
00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:03.719
guess that some political scientists would also argue that.

327
00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:07.880
But I mean, you're making the case here that

328
00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:11.269
that's not really the case they are based or these

329
00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:17.969
ideologies are based on things like have a justifications,

330
00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:22.009
rationalizations, moralization and so on. So perhaps tell

331
00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:25.670
us a little bit more about that. And if

332
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.750
you have a few more examples to illustrate this point

333
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.769
. Sure. So we can go through the idea

334
00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:37.118
of um uh authoritarianism. Uh Another widely proposed view

335
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.479
is that right wing ideology is all about respecting authority

336
00:19:40.489 --> 00:19:45.130
or obeying authority or um enforcing one's preferences on others

337
00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:48.969
. Uh And that just does not make a lot

338
00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:51.348
of sense at all. Um So if you ask

339
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.250
, you know, conservatives, whether we ought to

340
00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:55.769
respect authority more, most of them would say yes

341
00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:56.380
. But then if you ask them, if,

342
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.890
if companies should disobey government regulations that they think are

343
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.170
unfair, a majority of them will also say yes

344
00:20:03.189 --> 00:20:06.029
. So that's another example of an inconsistency. So

345
00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.910
conservatives are um are happy to say they support authority

346
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.630
in the abstract. But when it comes to specific

347
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.959
authorities, like, I don't know the IRS CDC

348
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:19.818
, the EPA the who um government regulators uh Democratic

349
00:20:19.989 --> 00:20:25.564
uh politicians, uh even the FBI once they started

350
00:20:25.574 --> 00:20:30.025
investigating Donald Trump, uh many uh Republicans turned against

351
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.364
. Uh These are a wide variety of authorities that

352
00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:36.844
Republicans reject and disrespect. So I, I think

353
00:20:36.854 --> 00:20:37.993
it is very hard to argue that they are holding

354
00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:41.479
a case. Um And if you think that it's

355
00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:45.670
about exercising authority over others, I think that's also

356
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.068
hard to reconcile with their actual opinions which involve uh

357
00:20:48.078 --> 00:20:55.130
you know, uh deregulating um uh businesses, um

358
00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:02.029
environmental deregulation uh uh uh having fewer restrictions during COVID-19

359
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.118
. Uh These are hard to reconcile with a general

360
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.469
desire to exercise authority over others. Um And if

361
00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:08.910
you look at the desire to exercise authority over others

362
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.479
in terms of restricting their speech, uh you actually

363
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:15.420
see uh uh little to no differences at all between

364
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.828
liberals and conservatives that is people want to restrict the

365
00:21:17.838 --> 00:21:21.049
speech of their political opponents, uh but not their

366
00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:22.009
political allies. And you see that on both sides

367
00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:23.989
of the political spectrum, if anything, there might

368
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.449
be a little bit of evidence that that is more

369
00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:29.140
prominent on the left these days. So I think

370
00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.910
it's hard to argue that that that authority or a

371
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:36.509
general desire to obey or exercise authority is the unifying

372
00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:40.390
principle of right wing ideology. Um So the other

373
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.680
one is uh tolerance. So that would be a

374
00:21:42.689 --> 00:21:47.549
um a, a kind of tribalism or nationalism or

375
00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:51.868
um ethnocentrism that is supposed to be uh more prevalent

376
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.529
among, among right wing people. And I think

377
00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:56.969
there, that's e equally at odds with reality.

378
00:21:56.239 --> 00:22:00.229
Uh So if you ask conservatives whether we ought to

379
00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:03.689
be more suspicious, uh and distrusting of foreigners,

380
00:22:03.699 --> 00:22:04.608
uh most of them will say yes. But then

381
00:22:04.618 --> 00:22:07.150
when you ask if we should trust Vladimir Putin,

382
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.818
when he said that he did not interfere in the

383
00:22:10.828 --> 00:22:12.449
2016 election, a majority of them will also say

384
00:22:12.459 --> 00:22:15.818
yes. Uh So there's, that's quite a stark

385
00:22:15.828 --> 00:22:17.858
inconsistency there that is, they think we should be

386
00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:19.449
distrusting of foreigners. But when it comes to AAA

387
00:22:19.459 --> 00:22:22.729
particular foreigner uh who, who, who is a

388
00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:26.500
Russian autocrat and hostile, overtly hostile to the United

389
00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:29.930
States, they seem to trust him quite readily.

390
00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:32.078
Uh And so I think that is one of many

391
00:22:32.088 --> 00:22:34.719
uh uh stark inconsistencies you see uh uh uh on

392
00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:37.009
, on the right. Uh And I think it's

393
00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:40.279
uh I list a few other examples in the paper

394
00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:42.160
but um you could also see similar inconsistencies on the

395
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.259
left that is the left will, will say that

396
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:48.328
they value uh you know, uh diversity and respecting

397
00:22:48.338 --> 00:22:51.640
the views of, of a variety of different groups

398
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.380
, but in fact, they disrespect the views of

399
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.439
uh any group that is mildly associated with conservatives.

400
00:22:56.449 --> 00:23:00.959
So Christian fundamentalists pro-life people, uh uh white people

401
00:23:00.969 --> 00:23:04.650
, men, uh uh wealthy business people, uh

402
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.209
these days, even uh pro-israeli people. Um So

403
00:23:10.219 --> 00:23:12.868
, uh the respect for diversity is actually, um

404
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.949
pretty restricted to a list of groups that are,

405
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:19.650
that are left coded. Mhm. Uh And I

406
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.890
mean, I'm not sure if this, what I'm

407
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.439
about to say makes sense or not, if it

408
00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:30.670
doesn't please correct me in whatever way you think.

409
00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:33.739
Uh It makes sense. But, uh I mean

410
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.199
, even when it comes to some of the supposed

411
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:41.160
principles or at least the labels people come up with

412
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:48.039
sometimes to refer to some of their values that supposedly

413
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:52.650
orient their political ideology. Uh I mean, sometimes

414
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:59.719
with same label people from different sides mean different things

415
00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:03.479
and they're also inconsistent within their own ideology. But

416
00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:07.739
for just to talk about different sides, meaning different

417
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.939
things. For example, when it comes to economics

418
00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:14.410
, perhaps someone on the left when they use the

419
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.348
word freedom or they, they would bring the word

420
00:24:18.358 --> 00:24:21.848
freedom to the table when saying, OK, so

421
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:26.608
uh perhaps workers should be paid enough, should earn

422
00:24:26.618 --> 00:24:30.568
enough to cover at least their basic expenses and to

423
00:24:30.578 --> 00:24:36.209
feel secure enough in their own lives. I mean

424
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:37.719
, if they work example, full time, they

425
00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:41.189
should earn enough to cover their bills and, and

426
00:24:41.199 --> 00:24:45.779
not being ejected from their homes and stuff like that

427
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.608
. And perhaps they might use the word freedom there

428
00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:52.469
in the sense of not being economically coerced, for

429
00:24:52.479 --> 00:24:55.818
example. But when it comes to the right,

430
00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:00.259
perhaps they would use the word freedom to refer more

431
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:03.328
to things like in the case of more libertarian right

432
00:25:03.338 --> 00:25:08.239
wingers, uh they want a more deregulated market and

433
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.618
that's freedom for them. So I mean that that's

434
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.318
also you're making in the sense that OK, so

435
00:25:15.328 --> 00:25:18.509
people use these words, they refer to principles,

436
00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:23.729
but even then they uh they use it very sometimes

437
00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:27.459
very loosely because in a particular situation, freedom means

438
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:30.670
one thing, in another situation, it means another

439
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.529
thing. And even the supposed meaning that in this

440
00:25:34.539 --> 00:25:38.479
particular case, freedom might have for the leftists and

441
00:25:38.489 --> 00:25:42.880
right wingers. If you look across different examples,

442
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.719
perhaps they are not. So much on the side

443
00:25:45.729 --> 00:25:49.650
of their own uh flavor of freedom, but they

444
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.868
are more authoritarian and so on. So does this

445
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.539
also make sense? Yeah, that makes a lot

446
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.939
of sense to me. I think it's a great

447
00:25:57.219 --> 00:26:00.588
example of, of the point I'm making, which

448
00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:02.108
is that it, it, it doesn't really make

449
00:26:02.118 --> 00:26:04.239
sense to say that one ideology is the ideology of

450
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.559
freedom, given that each uh political coalition is trying

451
00:26:08.568 --> 00:26:12.160
to use freedom to mobilize support for its side.

452
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.348
That is freedom is uh a word that has a

453
00:26:15.358 --> 00:26:18.939
lot of positive vibes. Uh If you, if

454
00:26:18.949 --> 00:26:19.660
you ask people, if they like freedom, I

455
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.279
bet you that most people will say, yeah,

456
00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:23.868
freedom is great. And so each party is basically

457
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.439
competing to capture the positive vibes of freedom to mobilize

458
00:26:27.449 --> 00:26:30.598
support for their side. Uh But whether each side

459
00:26:30.608 --> 00:26:33.459
actually consistently holds the principle of freedom is a different

460
00:26:33.469 --> 00:26:36.430
question. And I think the answer to that question

461
00:26:36.439 --> 00:26:37.858
is no, they don't. Um what they're trying

462
00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:41.699
to do is use freedom as a kind of mission

463
00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:45.650
statement to uh um associate their political coalition with positive

464
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.559
vibes. Um But I don't think it represents a

465
00:26:48.568 --> 00:26:52.969
coherent and principled philosophy because if it were, you

466
00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:55.789
would see each side, you know, uh valuing

467
00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:57.539
freedom in all cases. But that is uh but

468
00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:02.049
that is not what you see. Um Another example

469
00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:03.309
of this kind of competition for, for positive and

470
00:27:03.318 --> 00:27:06.259
negative vibes I think is really clear in the abortion

471
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:07.979
debate. Um you see, uh you know,

472
00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:11.900
people who oppose abortion, they, they describe themselves

473
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.739
as pro life that is, they're trying to paint

474
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.939
themselves as the group that values life, right?

475
00:27:18.949 --> 00:27:22.009
They're trying to put a positive spin on their view

476
00:27:22.108 --> 00:27:22.539
. Uh And, and in the same way,

477
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:25.969
uh people on the, on the pro choice side

478
00:27:26.118 --> 00:27:27.555
uh are trying to claim the mantle of freedom that

479
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:30.305
a woman should have the right to do what she

480
00:27:30.314 --> 00:27:33.424
wants with her own body. But of course,

481
00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:36.045
neither side holds this actual, this principle actually,

482
00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:38.184
consistently, people who are pro life are happy to

483
00:27:38.193 --> 00:27:41.963
be pro death when it comes to civilian casualties,

484
00:27:41.084 --> 00:27:44.914
when it comes to military occupations, when it comes

485
00:27:44.924 --> 00:27:47.699
to the death penalty, uh when it comes to

486
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:49.979
contraception, which could uh actually prevent abortions, um

487
00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:53.559
uh on the left, uh uh uh most liberals

488
00:27:53.568 --> 00:27:56.009
will say that a woman should have the right to

489
00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:57.430
do what she wants with her own body unless she

490
00:27:57.439 --> 00:28:02.949
wants to um say uh purchase private health insurance or

491
00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:06.618
not wear a seatbelt or drink a large sugary soda

492
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.348
or have sex for money. Uh These are all

493
00:28:08.358 --> 00:28:11.699
views that are pretty common on the left and they

494
00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:12.949
are pretty inconsistent with the idea that we should generally

495
00:28:12.959 --> 00:28:15.568
have the right to do what we want with our

496
00:28:15.578 --> 00:28:18.059
own bodies. Um So, uh that would be

497
00:28:18.068 --> 00:28:21.009
, that would be my, my case there.

498
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:23.449
Yeah. And I brought that to the table,

499
00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:29.358
I mean, people basically using the same term or

500
00:28:29.368 --> 00:28:32.989
referring to the same principle, but with different meanings

501
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.699
because sometimes in political debates, political discussions, it's

502
00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:40.858
very obvious, at least for someone looking on the

503
00:28:40.868 --> 00:28:45.229
outs from the outside that uh people are using the

504
00:28:45.239 --> 00:28:48.739
same term. But with completely different meanings, like

505
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.699
in this case, freedom and the examples I and

506
00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:56.670
you gave here. So um uh uh but perhaps

507
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.838
what I was alluding to there by bringing that discussion

508
00:29:00.848 --> 00:29:04.088
here to the table is that, is it really

509
00:29:04.098 --> 00:29:10.729
about the word or the principle of freedom or since

510
00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:15.318
you're uh using it to refer to completely different things

511
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.430
? Isn't it really about you having a particular kind

512
00:29:18.439 --> 00:29:22.239
of interest of you wanting to do some something or

513
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:27.029
wanting other people to do something as well uh or

514
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:33.130
not do for uh in particular cases and then simply

515
00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.078
attaching the label freedom to it just because it sounds

516
00:29:37.088 --> 00:29:41.279
good to try to convince other people, for example

517
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.469
. Yeah, I think it's very much the latter

518
00:29:44.479 --> 00:29:45.588
and I think it's, it's directly analogous to the

519
00:29:45.598 --> 00:29:48.489
marketing and pr you see in the corporate world,

520
00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:52.739
you know, corporations will have mission statements, they

521
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.019
have values that they are supposedly pursuing. Uh And

522
00:29:57.029 --> 00:30:00.410
, and because it is in their financial interest to

523
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.650
associate positive vibes with their brand, right? You

524
00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.598
know, Starbucks says their mission is to inspire and

525
00:30:04.608 --> 00:30:07.479
nurture the human spirit. Um I'm sure you could

526
00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:10.410
come up with, with, uh, uh equally

527
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.939
silly examples from, from other, uh, large

528
00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:15.459
corporations. Um, and I think there is an

529
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:19.618
interesting element there, which is that in order to

530
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.430
sell, in order to make money, you have

531
00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:23.618
to convince people that you're not interested in making money

532
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.098
. Uh, and I think that's what I would

533
00:30:26.108 --> 00:30:27.670
call a social. But I think you, you

534
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.680
see the exact same phenomenon in the political world in

535
00:30:30.689 --> 00:30:33.509
order to gain uh power, you have to convince

536
00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:34.660
people that you're not interested in gaining power, that

537
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.519
instead what you're interested in is making the world a

538
00:30:37.529 --> 00:30:40.588
better place. Generally making things better for everyone being

539
00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:42.809
uh kind and generous and fair and, and patriotic

540
00:30:42.818 --> 00:30:45.618
and virtuous and all those sunny things. But really

541
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.608
, uh um politics is a competition to gain control

542
00:30:49.618 --> 00:30:52.618
of the coercive apparatus of the state which uh literally

543
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.818
forces people to do things by threat of imprisonment.

544
00:30:56.078 --> 00:31:00.049
Uh And uh that is a scary thing and nobody

545
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:00.848
has ever gained power by saying that that's what they

546
00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:03.098
want. You know, I, I want to

547
00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:07.068
gain control of the, the coercive apparatus of the

548
00:31:07.078 --> 00:31:08.259
state so that I can boss people around and force

549
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:11.108
them to do things by threat of imprisonment. No

550
00:31:11.118 --> 00:31:12.338
one has ever gotten elected by saying that just as

551
00:31:12.348 --> 00:31:15.709
no business has ever made money by saying all I

552
00:31:15.719 --> 00:31:17.338
want to do is make as much money as possible

553
00:31:17.348 --> 00:31:18.299
. I don't care about values or the environment or

554
00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:22.439
, or whatever. Um So I think we have

555
00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:25.098
these, these um social paradoxes, these tensions in

556
00:31:25.108 --> 00:31:26.818
our mind that in order to pursue, pursue our

557
00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:29.328
goals, we cannot admit the goals we're pursuing.

558
00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:30.219
Uh And I think we can't even admit them to

559
00:31:30.229 --> 00:31:32.608
ourselves. A lot of the time. I think

560
00:31:32.618 --> 00:31:33.578
a lot of people at Starbucks would probably believe their

561
00:31:33.588 --> 00:31:37.009
own bullshit that they really are trying to inspire and

562
00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:37.900
nurture the human spirit. And I think uh most

563
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.180
committed partisans and ideologues also believe their own bullshit that

564
00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:45.189
they really are trying to uh pursue this impartially altruistic

565
00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:48.269
vision to uh uh better humanity in the world.

566
00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:53.368
Uh But when it comes to the social dynamics uh

567
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:59.890
themselves. So for example, things like social identity

568
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.189
and intergroup relations, what aspects of that kind of

569
00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:07.493
research would apply here because I mean, I I

570
00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:10.414
read in your paper that you are also trying to

571
00:32:10.424 --> 00:32:15.443
reframe, for example, the in group out group

572
00:32:15.453 --> 00:32:22.035
dichotomy as an allies versus rivals, dichotomy, right

573
00:32:22.045 --> 00:32:24.500
? Could, could you explain that? Sure.

574
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:29.358
So there's a whole bunch of research on what's called

575
00:32:29.368 --> 00:32:31.000
social identity theory, the idea that we have an

576
00:32:31.009 --> 00:32:34.459
in group and we have an out group and it's

577
00:32:34.469 --> 00:32:37.568
a monolithic in group and against a monolithic out group

578
00:32:37.578 --> 00:32:38.299
and they, they stay, they're fixed and they

579
00:32:38.309 --> 00:32:40.309
stay the same and we we, you know,

580
00:32:40.318 --> 00:32:44.348
do things and believe things to make us feel better

581
00:32:44.358 --> 00:32:45.500
about our in group to enhance our self esteem.

582
00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:49.588
And uh we, we do things that make the

583
00:32:49.598 --> 00:32:52.170
out group look worse to enhance our self esteem.

584
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.799
That is, that is the uh vision coming out

585
00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:57.420
of decades of research in social psychology. I think

586
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.130
that vision is, is deeply flawed for a number

587
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.709
of reasons. Uh uh for one thing, um

588
00:33:00.719 --> 00:33:05.559
If you actually look at the uh group dynamics and

589
00:33:05.568 --> 00:33:08.494
um uh small scale hunter gatherer for societies, uh

590
00:33:08.515 --> 00:33:12.435
It is nothing like the monolithic in group against the

591
00:33:12.445 --> 00:33:15.125
monolithic out group. It is very much uh complex

592
00:33:15.134 --> 00:33:21.115
strategic Aries occurring within groups. Uh They're constantly fission

593
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:23.776
and fusion. Uh They're called fission fusion societies,

594
00:33:23.786 --> 00:33:27.515
literally like they, they have small bands of around

595
00:33:27.526 --> 00:33:29.816
20 or 30 people and then they, they form

596
00:33:29.826 --> 00:33:31.161
larger groups and then they split apart. And so

597
00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:35.342
it's much more complicated and dynamic than the picture of

598
00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:37.010
a, of one tribe on one side of the

599
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:37.801
river and another tribe on the other side of the

600
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:42.182
river. I think we are much more politically savvy

601
00:33:42.192 --> 00:33:45.131
and sophisticated than this kind of caveman tribalism that is

602
00:33:45.141 --> 00:33:49.561
that has come out of uh social identity theory.

603
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:51.451
Um And so what I try to replace this,

604
00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:53.259
this picture with is instead of talking about in groups

605
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:54.848
and out groups, which is misleading in, in

606
00:33:54.858 --> 00:33:57.549
, in a variety of ways. I think it's

607
00:33:57.559 --> 00:34:00.009
, it's more illuminating to talk about alliances, to

608
00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:02.449
talk about allies and rivals. Uh and uh and

609
00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:06.489
conflicts within groups uh So, uh I can walk

610
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.539
you through some of the, the ways in which

611
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.139
this in group out group thing breaks down. So

612
00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:13.833
, uh you know, uh you might expect uh

613
00:34:13.842 --> 00:34:15.913
that uh uh in order to favor a group,

614
00:34:15.922 --> 00:34:19.152
you would have to be in that group, they

615
00:34:19.163 --> 00:34:20.172
would have to be in your, in group.

616
00:34:20.182 --> 00:34:22.172
And in order to um oppose a group, they

617
00:34:22.182 --> 00:34:23.052
would have to be uh your out group. But

618
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:25.461
that's just manifestly not the case. Uh You don't

619
00:34:25.472 --> 00:34:30.382
have to be a black person to feel as if

620
00:34:30.393 --> 00:34:32.083
you are an ally of black people and you don't

621
00:34:32.092 --> 00:34:35.235
have to be a police officer to feel as if

622
00:34:35.246 --> 00:34:37.425
you are an ally of police officers. You don't

623
00:34:37.436 --> 00:34:38.445
have to be an Israeli to feel pro Israel.

624
00:34:38.456 --> 00:34:40.074
You don't have to be a Palestinian to be pro

625
00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:43.034
Palestinian. You do not have to be in a

626
00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:45.675
group to be an ally of that group. Alliances

627
00:34:45.686 --> 00:34:47.425
can occur between groups and the same thing occurs within

628
00:34:47.436 --> 00:34:52.195
groups. You don't have to, you, you

629
00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:55.050
can be a white person and uh feel enmity toward

630
00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.519
white people. In fact, a lot of white

631
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.000
progressives uh feel that way about white people. Um

632
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:04.110
You can be an American and feel negatively toward Americans

633
00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.418
. Did a lot of progressives hold that view uh

634
00:35:06.429 --> 00:35:07.668
as well. Uh You can be a poor person

635
00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:10.708
and feel antipathy toward poor people. You can be

636
00:35:10.719 --> 00:35:14.478
a rich person, feel antipathy toward rich people.

637
00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:15.750
And these phenomena are much easier to understand when you

638
00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.849
realize that there are rivalries within groups that is within

639
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.128
the group of rich people. There are different subcultures

640
00:35:22.289 --> 00:35:24.000
uh within the group of poor people. There are

641
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.570
different subcultures, perhaps ethnic rivalries between lower class white

642
00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.898
people and lower class ethnic minorities, um uh et

643
00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:35.619
cetera, et cetera. So I think um if

644
00:35:35.628 --> 00:35:37.059
we, if we view politics from the lens of

645
00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.668
ever shifting alliances and rivalries, uh I think that

646
00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:44.320
is going to be much more illuminating and insightful way

647
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:46.349
of understanding things than in terms of cheering for some

648
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.039
monolithic in group against some monolithic out group that never

649
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.809
changes. And when it comes to the alliances,

650
00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:57.820
how do people form them? I mean, are

651
00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:00.260
there uh is there a set of criteria that people

652
00:36:00.269 --> 00:36:05.449
use to choose their allies? Yeah. So in

653
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:07.918
the paper, I go over three criteria that people

654
00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:10.260
use for choosing allies that have a lot of uh

655
00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:13.530
empirical evidence going for them at the moment. I'm

656
00:36:13.539 --> 00:36:15.849
not saying that these are the only three criteria we

657
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.250
use, but I think uh the strongest case could

658
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.659
be made that that these are important. So the

659
00:36:20.668 --> 00:36:23.208
three are uh similarity, transitivity and interdependence. So

660
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:25.800
I'll go through each one in turn, uh similarity

661
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.458
uh like attracts like we like people who are similar

662
00:36:29.469 --> 00:36:31.510
to us. Uh people who speak the same language

663
00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:35.559
who uh speak that language in the same dialect who

664
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:42.750
inhabit the same location uh who um share uh personality

665
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.750
quirks, maybe share similar beliefs, um uh share

666
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.099
the same skin color, et cetera, et cetera

667
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.349
. This is a pretty obvious one. And the

668
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.228
, and the evolutionary rationale there is pretty clear.

669
00:36:54.239 --> 00:36:58.800
Um So for one thing, uh similarity uh might

670
00:36:58.809 --> 00:37:01.030
help you coordinate and collaborate with an ally. That

671
00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:04.610
is uh the, the easiest example of this is

672
00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:06.489
if allies speak the same language, they're gonna have

673
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.849
an easier time working together. But um they could

674
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.269
also speak the same language of their subculture and have

675
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.500
an easier time working together or they could have,

676
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.000
you know, similar personality quirks and they might,

677
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.860
you know, uh uh be less likely to have

678
00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:21.449
conflicts and disagreements with one another because of, because

679
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:23.510
they're more similar in, in that vein. Um

680
00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:28.769
A marker might help to uh create common knowledge of

681
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.668
the alliance itself that as you see this in sports

682
00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:32.519
, you know, one team wears one wears a

683
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.769
red shirts, the other team wears blue shirts and

684
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.550
that helps everyone coordinate, uh who's on whose side

685
00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:39.938
. Uh We do the same thing with uh with

686
00:37:39.949 --> 00:37:43.489
our alliances and rivalries. And I think one of

687
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.110
the reasons why racism is so pernicious is because there

688
00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:49.989
are visible uh differences that are common knowledge to everyone

689
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.179
uh in terms of skin color and outward appearance.

690
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.070
Um And that helps uh make it easier for people

691
00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:59.300
to coordinate uh who's on whose side the second one

692
00:37:59.309 --> 00:38:01.780
is transitivity. Uh So that is summed up by

693
00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:05.260
the following statements, the enemy of my enemy is

694
00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:07.510
my friend. Uh The friend of my friend is

695
00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:08.989
my friend, the friend of my enemy is my

696
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.449
enemy and the enemy of my friend is my enemy

697
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.128
. Uh These statements taken together are what I call

698
00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:20.750
transitivity, the sharing of allies and enemies. And

699
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.148
there are pretty solid functional reasons why we would want

700
00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:25.789
transitive allies versus intransitive allies. That as it mitigates

701
00:38:25.978 --> 00:38:30.148
two major costs, one is infighting that is we

702
00:38:30.159 --> 00:38:32.449
don't want our allies getting into conflicts with one another

703
00:38:32.478 --> 00:38:35.168
because if they get into conflicts, then we're going

704
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.199
to have to be forced to choose sides. We

705
00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:38.188
have to be forced to choose between them. And

706
00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:39.769
that means we're going to lose one of our allies

707
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.929
and potentially gain a new enemy, which is really

708
00:38:42.938 --> 00:38:44.648
bad for us. So we want our allies to

709
00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:45.949
get along. Uh But, and we also want

710
00:38:45.958 --> 00:38:50.208
our allies to share our enemies because um if,

711
00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:52.619
if an ally uh is friendly toward our enemies,

712
00:38:52.628 --> 00:38:54.360
well, they might, they might side with our

713
00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:58.188
enemies and betray us. Uh And that is really

714
00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:00.039
bad for us as well. So for that reason

715
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:04.329
, we really uh we look to, to transitivity

716
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.090
when, when deciding who we want to ally with

717
00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:08.378
and who we don't. Uh and we also uh

718
00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:13.860
try to accommodate new allies by um by being transitive

719
00:39:13.869 --> 00:39:15.550
with them that is if, if we form an

720
00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:19.648
alliance, we oppose our allies, enemies. Uh

721
00:39:19.659 --> 00:39:23.840
and we support our allies, friends, that's transitivity

722
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.699
, uh inter interdependence. This is probably the broadest

723
00:39:27.708 --> 00:39:30.519
and most unexplored one. But I think um it's

724
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.648
, it's, it's perhaps one of the most important

725
00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:35.389
ones. This is just generally whether uh a person

726
00:39:35.398 --> 00:39:37.409
or individual benefits you or not, whether they are

727
00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:39.389
acting in your self interest or not. Um You

728
00:39:39.398 --> 00:39:42.949
could think of this uh in terms of someone acting

729
00:39:42.958 --> 00:39:44.688
against your self interest, say if you're competing with

730
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:47.389
someone for status or resources, um then you would

731
00:39:47.398 --> 00:39:50.449
be negatively interdependent with them and you would not want

732
00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:51.898
to form an alliance with them because it is in

733
00:39:51.909 --> 00:39:54.340
your interests to lower their status or to lower their

734
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:55.989
access to resources. So you can get more of

735
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.030
those resources for yourself. So it would be a

736
00:39:59.039 --> 00:40:00.898
kind of negative interdependence, a positive interdependence would be

737
00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:04.519
these people are inclined to help you to share information

738
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.978
with you, to trade with you, um et

739
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.739
cetera, et cetera. Um So interdependence are just

740
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:13.079
, you know, a, a cooper relationship wherein

741
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.869
uh uh parties benefit each other either directly or indirectly

742
00:40:15.878 --> 00:40:17.969
that is likely to lead to alliances. So those

743
00:40:17.978 --> 00:40:20.889
are the three criteria I discussed in the paper.

744
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:23.610
And of course, when we have alliances, we

745
00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:27.269
need, I mean to maintain them, of course

746
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.769
, we need to support our allies. And so

747
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.320
in, in the particular context of politics, or

748
00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:37.260
at least that's one of the contexts where you see

749
00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:39.878
this happening, how do we do that through the

750
00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:45.809
use of pro propagandistic uh tactics? So the point

751
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.659
of an alliance, from my perspective is to uh

752
00:40:49.668 --> 00:40:52.329
uh offer support in conflicts that is conflicts is ubiquitous

753
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.769
in social life. There are limited resources like status

754
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.719
, power and resources and one side's or, or

755
00:40:58.728 --> 00:41:01.458
one person's gain is is another side or person's loss

756
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.760
. So uh in order to prevail in these conflicts

757
00:41:06.769 --> 00:41:08.648
, we try to uh mobilize supporters, we try

758
00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:10.378
to draw people to our side so that our side

759
00:41:10.389 --> 00:41:13.708
is bigger than the other side and the other side

760
00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:15.918
submits to our bigger side. That's the way democracy

761
00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:19.739
works the side with the most votes wins. That's

762
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.219
how a lot of conflicts uh play out in small

763
00:41:22.228 --> 00:41:24.059
scale societies, the bigger side gets their way.

764
00:41:24.208 --> 00:41:27.619
Um And so we have a, a vested interest

765
00:41:27.628 --> 00:41:29.878
in making our side the bigger side. How do

766
00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:30.809
we do that? Uh The way we do that

767
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.438
is with propaganda. Um So when a conflict breaks

768
00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:37.909
out, we try to frame the conflict and describe

769
00:41:37.918 --> 00:41:43.570
it in ways that uh um flatter our allies and

770
00:41:43.579 --> 00:41:47.309
impugn our rivals. Um So I can walk you

771
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.469
through the three propagandistic biases I discussed in the paper

772
00:41:51.478 --> 00:41:53.110
if you'd like. Yeah, sure. So the

773
00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:58.378
first one is uh perpetrator biases. So uh probably

774
00:41:58.389 --> 00:42:00.739
the most common source of conflict would be someone committing

775
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.449
harm against someone else. Um And uh how do

776
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:08.269
you uh mobilize support for a perpetrator of a transgression

777
00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:10.929
against the person? They rocked. Well, one

778
00:42:10.938 --> 00:42:13.168
way you want to do that is you want to

779
00:42:13.179 --> 00:42:15.550
downplay that transgression. You want to minimize it,

780
00:42:15.648 --> 00:42:16.539
you want to justify it, you want to rationalize

781
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.559
it. You want to emphasize the mitigating circumstances,

782
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.929
you want to emphasize their good intentions, they didn't

783
00:42:22.938 --> 00:42:27.570
really mean to do anything wrong. Um You want

784
00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:30.059
to uh frame them as generally a good well meaning

785
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:32.449
person and the the victim as as being AAA crybaby

786
00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:35.728
or even making it up altogether. So that's what

787
00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:37.909
I would call perpetrator biases. Um They are extremely

788
00:42:37.918 --> 00:42:42.079
common uh both when we commit transgressions and when our

789
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.820
allies commit transgressions, we uh bring perpetrator biases to

790
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.110
bear on that. The other side of this,

791
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:50.530
of course, is victim biases. Victims have basically

792
00:42:50.539 --> 00:42:52.699
the opposite set of biases. So they uh will

793
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:58.599
view the perpetrator as uh uh incredibly personally responsible for

794
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.119
, for committing the harm, no mitigating circumstances,

795
00:43:00.128 --> 00:43:02.349
no good intentions. They were just pure evil twirling

796
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.708
their mustaches and, and they just wanted to harm

797
00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:08.159
us just out of pure sadism. Uh And uh

798
00:43:08.168 --> 00:43:09.969
of, of course, the harm they committed was

799
00:43:09.978 --> 00:43:14.000
incredibly grievous. It will last for generations. We

800
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.708
can, we should never forget it. We should

801
00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:17.599
always remember this horrible harm that has, that will

802
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:21.750
, that will last forever. Um Those, those

803
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.478
are um victim biases. Um You could think of

804
00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:28.320
it as the exact opposite of perpetrator biases. Um

805
00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:30.878
And then there's another class of interesting biases that relate

806
00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:34.769
to conflicts over status and resources. Uh This presumably

807
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.409
would also be a recurrent source of conflict in ancestral

808
00:43:37.418 --> 00:43:38.719
environments. And the way we resolve these conflicts is

809
00:43:38.728 --> 00:43:43.599
by making attributions about the causes of disadvantages and advantages

810
00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:45.378
. Um That is uh if we attribute a person's

811
00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:50.260
advantages to their internal dispositions, that is their intelligence

812
00:43:50.269 --> 00:43:52.300
, their talent, uh their wisdom, their,

813
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:54.510
their, their creativity, um their work ethic,

814
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:58.599
then uh we're inclined to side with that person and

815
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.188
let them have their advantages or their resources. Um

816
00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:04.139
But if a person uh uh lost a lot of

817
00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:06.059
resources or status through no fault of their own,

818
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:09.010
through misfortune through bad luck, um or through uh

819
00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:13.360
mistreatment or exploitation by others. Uh Then we're inclined

820
00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:15.579
to side with them and we're inclined to um uh

821
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.110
give resources to them and, and compensate them and

822
00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:20.878
help them in, in whatever way we can.

823
00:44:21.438 --> 00:44:23.148
Um So naturally, if there's a conflict over resources

824
00:44:23.159 --> 00:44:25.849
or status, then we're going to uh want to

825
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:30.659
attribute our high status allies uh advantages to their internal

826
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.418
dispositions, they're smart and, and hard working and

827
00:44:32.429 --> 00:44:36.769
our low status allies, disadvantages to external factors.

828
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.679
They were just unlucky or they were preyed upon by

829
00:44:38.688 --> 00:44:42.978
exploitative people. Uh And so we, we have

830
00:44:42.989 --> 00:44:45.728
both of these biases and we employ them depending on

831
00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:47.090
whether our allies are in the advantaged position or the

832
00:44:47.099 --> 00:44:51.329
disadvantaged position. And we do that in a strategic

833
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.708
way, those are attribution biases. And so how

834
00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:59.550
do we go from the biases you've just described there

835
00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:02.449
? And also uh what we talked about a bit

836
00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:07.090
earlier regarding social dynamics and alliances. How do we

837
00:45:07.099 --> 00:45:13.269
go from there to political alliance structures, like for

838
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.458
example, let's say a political party. Yeah.

839
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.260
So um it just kind of falls naturally out of

840
00:45:20.269 --> 00:45:22.599
those, those basic assumptions about how our psychology works

841
00:45:22.918 --> 00:45:24.179
. So if you just think about, you know

842
00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:27.688
, similarity, transitivity, interdependence and just look at

843
00:45:27.699 --> 00:45:29.418
the, the kind of social groups that form in

844
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:30.579
any given society, you can start to see how

845
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:34.099
this might unfold. So for example, you might

846
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.458
get some uh some groups forming based on ethnicity uh

847
00:45:37.469 --> 00:45:39.199
or uh region, you know, southerners might have

848
00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:44.559
a kind of Southern loyalty or class uh or uh

849
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.699
or religion. Um And from there, you,

850
00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:47.918
you start to think about, well, how are

851
00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:51.159
these groups going to coalesce into different alliances? And

852
00:45:51.168 --> 00:45:53.250
then you might start thinking about transitivity and then you

853
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.898
might start thinking about overlap between groups. So maybe

854
00:45:55.909 --> 00:45:59.409
, you know, ethnic minorities are going to overlap

855
00:45:59.418 --> 00:46:00.590
with poor people. And so you might get an

856
00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:04.539
alliance between the interests of ethnic minorities and the interests

857
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.539
of lower class people. Um And you might see

858
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.050
uh some, some status rivalries between, you know

859
00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:12.409
, members of the upper class. That is the

860
00:46:12.418 --> 00:46:16.010
more highly educated uh elites and the less educated,

861
00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:20.769
wealthy corporate executives. And you might see a rivalry

862
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.849
there with perhaps uh intellectual elites siding with um ethnic

863
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.489
minorities and poor people and with the wealthy business people

864
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.369
siding with uh lower class white people who might feel

865
00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:36.128
rival risk with their lower class, ethnic minority counterparts

866
00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:38.570
. Uh And uh that's, that's basically the,

867
00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:42.429
the dynamics of how it plays out. Um And

868
00:46:42.438 --> 00:46:44.340
then from there, once you, you get this

869
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:46.610
alliance structure, um it, you just straightforwardly apply

870
00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:50.570
those propagandistic biases to each member of the alliance structure

871
00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:52.320
. And then from there, do the contents of

872
00:46:52.329 --> 00:46:55.059
political belief systems just fall out uh perfectly. Uh

873
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.239
And you, and you can get a beautiful explanation

874
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.398
for all of the inconsistencies and double standards and idiosyncrasies

875
00:47:00.429 --> 00:47:02.949
of political belief system simply by looking at the alliance

876
00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:07.000
structure and looking at what beliefs would mobilize support for

877
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:10.679
each member of that alliance structure and from their ideologies

878
00:47:10.688 --> 00:47:15.688
uh fall out of that elegantly. But since from

879
00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:19.340
the very beginning of our conversation, we've also been

880
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:23.139
referring to alternative theories. Uh In this case,

881
00:47:23.148 --> 00:47:28.228
in the paper, you also go through, for

882
00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:34.304
example, intolerance theory of authoritarianism theory and egalitarianism theory

883
00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:36.954
. So could you tell us about those? I

884
00:47:36.965 --> 00:47:40.894
mean, how uh in what ways they would be

885
00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:45.405
alternatives to your alliance theory of political belief systems?

886
00:47:45.414 --> 00:47:50.885
And I in what aspects do you think they failed

887
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.369
? Sure. Um So one alternative explanation for the

888
00:47:54.378 --> 00:47:57.329
existing alliance structure that is, is that it's all

889
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.369
based on equality. And really what you see in

890
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:01.510
the left wing alliance is just a bunch of low

891
00:48:01.519 --> 00:48:04.699
status disadvantaged groups. And what you see in the

892
00:48:04.708 --> 00:48:06.579
right wing alliance is just a bunch of high status

893
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.550
disadvantaged groups. But if you actually look at the

894
00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:10.360
alliance structure, you see that that is not the

895
00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:13.469
case. So there are plenty of high status groups

896
00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:15.050
uh on the left wing side, like college professors

897
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:20.978
, scientists, uh government regulators, um members of

898
00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:28.070
the uh of, of international organizations, um scientists

899
00:48:28.079 --> 00:48:30.599
, et cetera. Uh And then you also see

900
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:31.760
plenty of low status groups on the right wing side

901
00:48:31.769 --> 00:48:34.639
. So you see, uh you know, working

902
00:48:34.648 --> 00:48:37.938
class white people, um you know, uh manufacturing

903
00:48:37.949 --> 00:48:42.070
workers, um people without a college degree, people

904
00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:45.079
in uh uh small towns that are struggling. Um

905
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:51.349
And uh what's interesting is that if you actually measure

906
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.438
groups, perceived status and you measure their perceived political

907
00:48:54.449 --> 00:48:58.340
allegiances, turns out that status makes no difference uh

908
00:48:58.349 --> 00:49:00.728
in in predicting which group, either side of the

909
00:49:00.739 --> 00:49:02.349
political spectrum will like will like or dislike. So

910
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.550
this, I'm referring here to the work of mark

911
00:49:05.559 --> 00:49:07.889
brand. Uh And he measured attitudes toward a variety

912
00:49:07.898 --> 00:49:09.610
of different groups, dozens of, of different social

913
00:49:09.619 --> 00:49:13.938
groups in society measured their status, measured their perceived

914
00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:16.159
political allegiances. Turns out the simplest and most elegant

915
00:49:16.168 --> 00:49:20.590
and powerful model just uses the group's perceived political allegiances

916
00:49:20.599 --> 00:49:23.179
, throws out status throws out other variables that basically

917
00:49:23.188 --> 00:49:27.079
predicts who you're going to like, uh, and

918
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.030
, and dislike. Um, and, and,

919
00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:30.039
and if you just think about other groups, you

920
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.378
know, like there are plenty of groups in the

921
00:49:31.389 --> 00:49:35.360
political line structure that don't really seem high status or

922
00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:37.978
low status at all. Like our environmentalists, high

923
00:49:37.989 --> 00:49:38.289
status. I, I don't know, uh,

924
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.938
are, are Christian fundamentalist, high status or low

925
00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:44.648
status? I don't know. Uh what about Southerners

926
00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:45.478
, high status or low status? Not sure.

927
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:52.250
Um pro-life people, unclear, recreational drug users,

928
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.090
unclear. Uh Really, I think status is either

929
00:49:55.099 --> 00:49:58.418
ambiguous or it violates the rules. So I don't

930
00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.500
think that equality can really explain uh contemporary alliance structures

931
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:04.978
and it certainly can't explain uh the variation in allied

932
00:50:04.989 --> 00:50:07.280
structures you see around the world and throughout history.

933
00:50:07.289 --> 00:50:08.329
So the alliance structures were very different in the past

934
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.059
. Uh uh uh African Americans used to be quite

935
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.429
loyal to the party of Lincoln uh racist, segregationist

936
00:50:15.438 --> 00:50:16.813
Southerners used to be quite loyal to the Democrats Party

937
00:50:16.824 --> 00:50:20.164
. They were known as Dixiecrats. Uh uh uh

938
00:50:20.175 --> 00:50:22.434
uh devout Christianity used to, to not be a

939
00:50:22.445 --> 00:50:25.364
partisan issue at all. Uh So if you,

940
00:50:25.375 --> 00:50:27.934
if you look at these line structures, there's so

941
00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:30.125
much variation across time and space that it's really hard

942
00:50:30.135 --> 00:50:32.304
to argue that any principle of equality uh is organizing

943
00:50:32.313 --> 00:50:35.144
them. And then of course, there are plenty

944
00:50:35.155 --> 00:50:37.554
of ideological inconsistencies regarding equality which I discuss in the

945
00:50:37.563 --> 00:50:39.583
paper and which I, I talked about previously.

946
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:45.929
Um the other ones, authority and diversity. Um

947
00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:47.570
Yeah, I basically use the same strategy with those

948
00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:50.849
. I, I go through uh plenty of ideological

949
00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.489
uh inconsistencies where these principles are not uh held.

950
00:50:54.639 --> 00:50:59.128
Uh and, and are often flouted uh strategically.

951
00:50:59.929 --> 00:51:02.570
Um And yeah, that's, that's basically my,

952
00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:07.010
my beef with uh egalitarianism, authoritarianism and tolerance.

953
00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:10.579
So, since you're from the US, do you

954
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:15.659
think that if your theory is correct, it might

955
00:51:15.668 --> 00:51:21.610
help us understand or better understand the formation of the

956
00:51:21.619 --> 00:51:27.969
Democratic Republican divide? Whether, yeah, so I

957
00:51:27.978 --> 00:51:30.110
, I presented a pretty detailed sketch of, of

958
00:51:30.119 --> 00:51:32.530
how I think this divide originated. Uh And uh

959
00:51:32.539 --> 00:51:36.889
where, where it was, you know, around

960
00:51:36.918 --> 00:51:39.550
100 150 years ago and how it has evolved over

961
00:51:39.559 --> 00:51:43.309
time. So, as I mentioned, uh previously

962
00:51:43.369 --> 00:51:45.780
, uh the current political instructor is very different than

963
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:47.269
what it was. Um you know, 100 150

964
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.128
years ago at the turn of the 20th century.

965
00:51:50.478 --> 00:51:53.289
Um Yeah, you know, uh Christianity and,

966
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.909
and, and abortion was just not an issue.

967
00:51:54.918 --> 00:51:57.579
It was not a divide. Feminism was, was

968
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.260
not a divide between the two parties. Um uh

969
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:02.929
at the turn of the 20th century, um race

970
00:52:02.938 --> 00:52:06.199
was very different. So, uh African Americans were

971
00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:08.159
actually leaned in favor of the Republican Party, uh

972
00:52:08.179 --> 00:52:14.300
uh racist southerners were, were Democrats. Um So

973
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:16.969
, uh I walk through the evolution of that alliance

974
00:52:16.978 --> 00:52:21.340
structure and how it has changed in the paper.

975
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:22.648
Uh And I think uh you could tell a similar

976
00:52:22.659 --> 00:52:25.208
story for how alliance structures have played out in other

977
00:52:25.219 --> 00:52:28.909
societies. I think you see some overlaps in,

978
00:52:28.918 --> 00:52:30.820
in similar countries like uh countries in Western Europe.

979
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.659
Uh And I think that could be explained by just

980
00:52:34.668 --> 00:52:37.418
uh convergences and the types of, of factors that

981
00:52:37.429 --> 00:52:38.739
create alliance structures. So if you have, you

982
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:44.688
know, overlap between um highly religious pos, you

983
00:52:44.699 --> 00:52:45.280
know, whatever the cause of that overlap, if

984
00:52:45.289 --> 00:52:46.989
there's overlap, then groups are gonna be more likely

985
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.628
to form an alliance and, and belong to the

986
00:52:49.639 --> 00:52:52.389
same political coalition than other groups. And I think

987
00:52:52.398 --> 00:52:53.659
you see that convergence in a lot of Western European

988
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.659
nations, particularly nations who have, who have um

989
00:52:57.668 --> 00:53:01.260
had similar uh political conflicts um about globalization and the

990
00:53:01.269 --> 00:53:07.188
erosion of religious morality. Um And it also explains

991
00:53:07.199 --> 00:53:07.449
some of the differences. I think if you look

992
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:10.260
at the unique history of different uh countries, particularly

993
00:53:10.269 --> 00:53:13.769
Eastern European countries who, who uh who are dealing

994
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.860
with the collapse of communism uh that has resulted in

995
00:53:15.869 --> 00:53:19.128
different alliances. You even there's an interesting example,

996
00:53:19.139 --> 00:53:22.340
I cite in the paper in Latvia where uh um

997
00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:25.610
uh green parties were actually sort of uh anti-communist,

998
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:30.099
right wing nationalist uh parties uh because they were,

999
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.199
they rose in opposition to Soviet industrial policy. Um

1000
00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:35.010
So there are lots of, there are lots of

1001
00:53:35.019 --> 00:53:37.208
interesting examples of alliance structures that, that deviate from

1002
00:53:37.219 --> 00:53:39.059
what you see, in America and a few uh

1003
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:43.438
western nations. Um And I talk about that a

1004
00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:45.070
lot in the paper and how other theories really struggle

1005
00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:49.239
to explain it. Uh And so, uh I

1006
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.168
would also like to ask you about, uh I

1007
00:53:52.179 --> 00:53:54.639
would, I would like to hear your thoughts about

1008
00:53:54.648 --> 00:54:00.039
uh moral foundations theory. That's also something that we

1009
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:04.039
touched on earlier a little bit. So, um

1010
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.208
what are your thoughts on it? And on basically

1011
00:54:07.219 --> 00:54:12.360
the idea bit uh about there being a connection or

1012
00:54:12.369 --> 00:54:17.199
an intimate connection between uh certain moral values and also

1013
00:54:17.208 --> 00:54:23.489
certain correspond or supposedly corresponding political ideologies. And uh

1014
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.829
a second question I have that's related to that is

1015
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:35.648
uh do you think that um the way you're thinking

1016
00:54:35.659 --> 00:54:39.128
about or reframing the way we think about political belief

1017
00:54:39.139 --> 00:54:45.208
system, uh ethical systems or not? Yeah.

1018
00:54:45.219 --> 00:54:49.228
Um So, uh first, I'll just start off

1019
00:54:49.239 --> 00:54:50.989
by saying that I'm, I'm very skeptical of,

1020
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.688
of moral foundations theory as a theory of political differences

1021
00:54:54.699 --> 00:54:58.389
. So I don't think it can explain why liberals

1022
00:54:58.398 --> 00:55:00.750
and conservatives have the beliefs. They do. I

1023
00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:02.099
don't think it can even come close to explaining all

1024
00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:05.489
of the inconsistencies in political ideologies. In fact,

1025
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.409
it struggles to make sense of them. Um As

1026
00:55:07.418 --> 00:55:09.570
I argue in the paper. So I think in

1027
00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:13.449
terms of a theory of political belief systems, moral

1028
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:17.438
foundations theory fails um as a theory of moral cognition

1029
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.989
, uh I think it's fine as a first pass

1030
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.280
, I think there, you know, the,

1031
00:55:22.289 --> 00:55:25.760
the six foundations that he sketched are reasonable hypotheses about

1032
00:55:25.769 --> 00:55:30.340
um cognitive adaptations that might have evolved to solve recurrent

1033
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:32.918
problems and cooper operation and, and group living.

1034
00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:37.648
Um I personally prefer uh Oliver Curry's work which sort

1035
00:55:37.659 --> 00:55:40.469
of expands upon uh Jonathan he's work uh and adds

1036
00:55:40.478 --> 00:55:44.168
a few additional uh foundations and gets a little bit

1037
00:55:44.179 --> 00:55:46.010
more systematic about the, the game theory uh uh

1038
00:55:46.019 --> 00:55:51.128
uh of, of these adaptive problems. Um So

1039
00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:52.559
as a theory of morality, I, I have

1040
00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.438
no objections to moral foundations theory. Um So the

1041
00:55:55.449 --> 00:55:59.639
question was whether um this sort of cynical view of

1042
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:04.119
political ideologies applies to moral systems as well. Um

1043
00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:08.139
And maybe, maybe not. Um So in the

1044
00:56:08.148 --> 00:56:10.329
paper, I sort of take great pains to distinguish

1045
00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:14.820
between politics and morality because I think they're too often

1046
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:16.619
conflated uh in a way that causes a lot of

1047
00:56:16.628 --> 00:56:21.039
confusion. And the reason they're conflated is because politics

1048
00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.878
uh almost always masquerades as morality in order to,

1049
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.349
in order to achieve its political objectives, that is

1050
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.500
in order to rally people to our side, we

1051
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:31.409
have to convince people that our side is the good

1052
00:56:31.418 --> 00:56:34.639
side, the moral side, the virtuous side,

1053
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:37.449
and the other side is evil, unfair, uh

1054
00:56:37.579 --> 00:56:42.119
disrespectful, et cetera. So morality is our chief

1055
00:56:42.128 --> 00:56:44.539
weapon in our political arsenal. And that is why

1056
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.429
it is often so easy to confuse morality with politics

1057
00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:50.099
as if they were the same thing that is to

1058
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:54.739
confuse moralism with, with morality. Um And uh

1059
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.378
in the paper, I, I try to differentiate

1060
00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:01.550
politics and morality in the following way. I describe

1061
00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:07.119
politics as being centrally about conflict and loyalty to one

1062
00:57:07.128 --> 00:57:09.250
or the other side of that conflict. That's what

1063
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:15.070
I think politics is ultimately about uh uh and morality

1064
00:57:15.079 --> 00:57:17.389
is ultimately about cooper operation that is working together for

1065
00:57:17.398 --> 00:57:22.349
a mutual benefit uh and impartiality to uh either side

1066
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.280
of a conflict and working to resolve conflicts. So

1067
00:57:24.289 --> 00:57:28.148
, uh in that sense, when once you cleave

1068
00:57:28.159 --> 00:57:30.148
uh politics from morality, morality starts to look pretty

1069
00:57:30.159 --> 00:57:32.610
nice. Um So in that sense, I don't

1070
00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:37.539
think that um uh morality as distinguished from, from

1071
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.519
politics, uh it can be described in the same

1072
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:42.489
sort of cynical terms as being about, you know

1073
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.739
, self interested. Um uh flouting of moral principles

1074
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.878
. I think we do have genuine moral principles that

1075
00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:51.519
are shared between liberals and conservatives. I think the

1076
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:54.000
prevailing view that ideologies are about moral disagreement is actually

1077
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:58.070
backwards. I think um at the heart of our

1078
00:57:58.079 --> 00:58:00.449
political disputes is, is moral agreement that is we

1079
00:58:00.458 --> 00:58:02.550
are using the same moral moral language, the same

1080
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:06.679
moral intuitions to try to win political conflicts. Uh

1081
00:58:06.688 --> 00:58:08.239
We're trying to cast our side as the fair side

1082
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:10.840
, as the side for freedom, the side for

1083
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:15.199
patriotism. Um the side for compassion. Uh And

1084
00:58:15.208 --> 00:58:17.898
, and we couldn't have those political fights if both

1085
00:58:17.909 --> 00:58:22.579
sides didn't care about compassion, uh freedom, fairness

1086
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:23.260
, et cetera. So I think we have common

1087
00:58:23.269 --> 00:58:28.429
moral intuitions that partisans compete to activate and that underlies

1088
00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:31.110
a lot of our political discourse. And so again

1089
00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:36.188
, if your theory is correct, um would it

1090
00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:39.728
have some implications as to how we look at uh

1091
00:58:39.739 --> 00:58:45.668
correlations between individual differences and political beliefs? Like,

1092
00:58:45.679 --> 00:58:51.800
for example, a certain differences in personality traits and

1093
00:58:51.809 --> 00:58:55.099
particular political beliefs. Sure. Yeah. So a

1094
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:59.840
lot of people think that personality traits are the explanation

1095
00:58:59.849 --> 00:59:00.958
for our political belief systems. I think that's wrong

1096
00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:02.978
, but that doesn't mean that they don't matter and

1097
00:59:02.989 --> 00:59:06.889
they don't exist clearly. There is some evidence that

1098
00:59:06.898 --> 00:59:08.619
there are some personality differences between liberals and conservatives.

1099
00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:12.500
There are some psychological differences between liberal conservatives. The

1100
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.769
question is, what role do they play? Uh

1101
00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:15.958
, in my view, uh, they play a

1102
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:20.500
secondary role to alliances. Um, and, uh

1103
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.360
, there are two ways that, that, that

1104
00:59:22.369 --> 00:59:23.978
personality. Uh, so, uh, the first

1105
00:59:23.989 --> 00:59:30.958
way is that, um, your psychological traits might

1106
00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:35.840
predispose you to join certain alliances over others that is

1107
00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:38.289
, you might be inclined to side with people who

1108
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.239
are like you or who act in the interests of

1109
00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:45.320
people who are like you. Um, so that's

1110
00:59:45.329 --> 00:59:47.949
, that's one possible mechanism. So, for example

1111
00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:52.409
, um, if I am sexually restricted, uh

1112
00:59:52.418 --> 00:59:54.300
, and, uh, uptight about sexual promiscuity,

1113
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:58.478
I might be more inclined to become religious. Um

1114
00:59:58.489 --> 00:60:00.179
, and if I'm more sexually promiscuous, I might

1115
00:60:00.188 --> 00:60:00.769
be more, I might be less inclined to become

1116
00:60:00.780 --> 00:60:05.320
religious. I might abandon my, my religious upbringing

1117
00:60:06.340 --> 00:60:07.239
. Um And uh and of course, so,

1118
00:60:07.250 --> 00:60:09.340
so there will be a causal pathway between your sexual

1119
00:60:09.349 --> 00:60:13.570
strategy, your religiosity and your ideology. But ultimately

1120
00:60:13.579 --> 00:60:15.398
, the religiosity is what's um predicting the, the

1121
00:60:15.409 --> 00:60:19.878
ideology, not the, the uh sexual strategy directly

1122
00:60:20.599 --> 00:60:22.619
. Uh II, I think, uh or,

1123
00:60:22.628 --> 00:60:23.179
or, or, you know, the sexual strategy

1124
00:60:23.188 --> 00:60:28.059
, predicting loyalty to fellow uh sexually restricted people and

1125
00:60:28.070 --> 00:60:30.708
, and wanting to advance their group interests. So

1126
00:60:30.719 --> 00:60:32.070
that's one way, the other way is that the

1127
00:60:32.079 --> 00:60:36.949
group you belong to or ally with, uh shapes

1128
00:60:36.958 --> 00:60:38.458
your personality or your psychological traits. There are plenty

1129
00:60:38.469 --> 00:60:39.750
of ways you can see that if you belong to

1130
00:60:39.760 --> 00:60:42.938
a religious community, they're going to pressure you to

1131
00:60:42.949 --> 00:60:46.760
behave in ways that are that um uh that mark

1132
00:60:46.769 --> 00:60:50.128
you as a member of that religious community and distinguish

1133
00:60:50.139 --> 00:60:52.809
you from other communities, they're gonna want you to

1134
00:60:52.019 --> 00:60:54.590
uh uh profess your devotion to the religions, creeds

1135
00:60:54.599 --> 00:60:59.179
to um to purge all doubts and uncertainties from your

1136
00:60:59.188 --> 00:61:01.559
mind uh to become more sexually restricted if you.

1137
00:61:01.579 --> 00:61:04.958
Uh So it might work the other way as well

1138
00:61:05.110 --> 00:61:07.119
. Um So there are really two possible ways.

1139
00:61:07.128 --> 00:61:08.860
So your, your personality might uh cause you to

1140
00:61:08.869 --> 00:61:13.769
join certain alliances over others or your, your alliance

1141
00:61:13.780 --> 00:61:16.019
might shape your personality. Uh And I think both

1142
00:61:16.030 --> 00:61:20.909
of those uh uh mechanisms are compatible with alliance theory

1143
00:61:20.918 --> 00:61:22.329
and compatible with the idea that alliances are ultimately the

1144
00:61:22.340 --> 00:61:28.800
direct primary cause of our political beliefs. Uh And

1145
00:61:28.809 --> 00:61:30.780
so your paper is all about, uh sort of

1146
00:61:30.789 --> 00:61:36.349
new approach in political psychology, what you call there

1147
00:61:36.360 --> 00:61:40.059
a shift from deep seated moral values to ever shifting

1148
00:61:40.070 --> 00:61:45.378
alliances and rivalries. So before we move on from

1149
00:61:45.389 --> 00:61:47.489
this topic to another one, I would like to

1150
00:61:47.500 --> 00:61:51.059
ask you. So do you think that I if

1151
00:61:51.070 --> 00:61:54.820
you're correct? And if basically we told people about

1152
00:61:54.829 --> 00:62:00.050
this, that when people get frustrated because for example

1153
00:62:00.059 --> 00:62:02.110
, from someone from their own political group, political

1154
00:62:02.119 --> 00:62:06.829
party, for example, they find out that they

1155
00:62:06.840 --> 00:62:12.780
have uh also um alliances to some extent with people

1156
00:62:12.789 --> 00:62:20.889
from other political ideologies and they get very frustrated because

1157
00:62:20.898 --> 00:62:22.219
, and they call them, for example, hypocrites

1158
00:62:22.228 --> 00:62:27.030
or traitors or turn cloaks or something like that.

1159
00:62:27.309 --> 00:62:30.840
Do you think that it could help people perhaps be

1160
00:62:30.849 --> 00:62:36.409
a little bit more understanding of where that behavior comes

1161
00:62:36.418 --> 00:62:38.579
from? And perhaps also the fact that they probably

1162
00:62:38.590 --> 00:62:44.489
also do that themselves and I mean, perhaps be

1163
00:62:44.500 --> 00:62:50.500
a little less divisive in their political approaches or is

1164
00:62:50.510 --> 00:62:55.599
that too optimistic? Um I, I'm torn on

1165
00:62:55.610 --> 00:62:58.579
that. II, I definitely think knowledge is a

1166
00:62:58.590 --> 00:63:00.628
good thing and, and, and knowledge of the

1167
00:63:00.639 --> 00:63:04.679
truth might help us solve our problems and in particular

1168
00:63:04.688 --> 00:63:07.800
our political problems. Um you know, sometimes studying

1169
00:63:07.809 --> 00:63:10.878
this makes me depressed and, and cynical and pessimistic

1170
00:63:12.050 --> 00:63:14.139
. Uh Sometimes I see a bit of a silver

1171
00:63:14.148 --> 00:63:15.510
lining. I think one silver lining, you might

1172
00:63:15.519 --> 00:63:19.269
see is that, uh, this shows us that

1173
00:63:19.280 --> 00:63:21.340
we're really not as different as we think we are

1174
00:63:21.570 --> 00:63:22.648
that we don't have these deep seated, uh,

1175
00:63:22.659 --> 00:63:25.869
world views that are, that are, that are

1176
00:63:27.000 --> 00:63:29.418
completely clashing and at odds with one another, we

1177
00:63:29.429 --> 00:63:31.519
don't have fundamentally different moral principles. We basically have

1178
00:63:31.530 --> 00:63:35.898
the same moral principles. We all care about fairness

1179
00:63:35.909 --> 00:63:37.269
. Um, we all care about, you know

1180
00:63:37.280 --> 00:63:38.550
, uh, helping people who are truly in need

1181
00:63:38.780 --> 00:63:39.840
. Uh We all care about, you know,

1182
00:63:39.849 --> 00:63:43.050
welcoming people into our group when they pose no threat

1183
00:63:43.059 --> 00:63:45.409
and when they're willing to uh be an, you

1184
00:63:45.418 --> 00:63:46.449
know, an asset to our group, um and

1185
00:63:46.458 --> 00:63:49.878
the differences really come from our beliefs about those things

1186
00:63:49.889 --> 00:63:52.659
about, you know, what, what is unfair

1187
00:63:52.668 --> 00:63:54.510
, what is fair, uh Whether the people we

1188
00:63:54.519 --> 00:63:58.148
want to welcome really are a threat or, or

1189
00:63:58.159 --> 00:64:00.438
not. Um whether uh the people we want to

1190
00:64:00.449 --> 00:64:03.378
help really are in need. Those are really what

1191
00:64:03.389 --> 00:64:06.574
, what political differences are about. They're not uh

1192
00:64:06.583 --> 00:64:10.885
an absence or a presence of compassion or an absence

1193
00:64:10.894 --> 00:64:14.474
or presence of uh uh you know, a willingness

1194
00:64:14.485 --> 00:64:15.534
to, to welcome people to the group or,

1195
00:64:15.543 --> 00:64:18.583
or um an absence or presence of uh concerns for

1196
00:64:18.594 --> 00:64:21.824
fairness. Um So I think uh at the heart

1197
00:64:21.833 --> 00:64:25.293
of our political disputes is, is a shared moral

1198
00:64:25.304 --> 00:64:28.958
psychology. Uh And I think that should challenge the

1199
00:64:28.969 --> 00:64:31.829
idea that one side is inherently morally superior to the

1200
00:64:31.840 --> 00:64:33.679
other side, at least in terms of their underlying

1201
00:64:33.688 --> 00:64:36.699
character, maybe their beliefs make them do things in

1202
00:64:36.708 --> 00:64:39.619
the world that are bad but in terms of their

1203
00:64:39.628 --> 00:64:42.780
underlying character, their moral psychology, their intuitions,

1204
00:64:42.789 --> 00:64:45.269
the way they interact with their family and their friends

1205
00:64:45.349 --> 00:64:46.909
. Uh, most people are pretty decent people.

1206
00:64:47.208 --> 00:64:49.079
Uh, and, yeah, sometimes they can have

1207
00:64:49.090 --> 00:64:53.280
beliefs that, that make them do terrible things but

1208
00:64:53.289 --> 00:64:55.340
I think it's worth remembering that, that, um

1209
00:64:55.349 --> 00:64:57.099
, we're not as different as, as we think

1210
00:64:57.110 --> 00:64:59.570
we are. Yeah. I, I was also

1211
00:64:59.579 --> 00:65:02.289
perhaps thinking about the fact that, uh, if

1212
00:65:02.300 --> 00:65:08.539
people understand that, uh, people's political beliefs and

1213
00:65:08.550 --> 00:65:14.000
their own political beliefs are not so as coherent or

1214
00:65:14.010 --> 00:65:17.458
consistent as they think, uh, that perhaps when

1215
00:65:17.469 --> 00:65:20.760
they, for example, see someone that, uh

1216
00:65:20.769 --> 00:65:25.530
, identifies with their own political poll, political party

1217
00:65:25.539 --> 00:65:28.958
or something like that, uh, espousing, uh

1218
00:65:28.969 --> 00:65:32.679
, political beliefs that they don't necessarily agree with.

1219
00:65:32.688 --> 00:65:36.168
That's not really the end of the world or a

1220
00:65:36.179 --> 00:65:41.418
tragedy. It's just that, uh, I mean

1221
00:65:41.599 --> 00:65:47.070
, no one is fully consistent and no one follows

1222
00:65:47.079 --> 00:65:49.728
, uh, I don't know the, a particular

1223
00:65:49.739 --> 00:65:54.648
kind of political dogma to, uh, uh,

1224
00:65:54.659 --> 00:65:58.570
to the last detail. So I don't know if

1225
00:65:58.590 --> 00:65:59.708
, yeah. No, that's, that's, that's

1226
00:65:59.719 --> 00:66:00.579
a good point. Yeah. No, that,

1227
00:66:00.590 --> 00:66:01.250
that makes sense. So, I, I guess

1228
00:66:01.619 --> 00:66:04.239
the idea is that you might be less, uh

1229
00:66:04.250 --> 00:66:08.619
, pissed off by your, by the traitors on

1230
00:66:08.628 --> 00:66:12.550
your side. Um, once you realize that your

1231
00:66:12.559 --> 00:66:15.320
side is just a cobbled together patchwork of inconsistent beliefs

1232
00:66:15.489 --> 00:66:17.539
. If, if you think that your side has

1233
00:66:17.550 --> 00:66:21.519
a coherent principled moral philosophy and you see someone deviating

1234
00:66:21.530 --> 00:66:23.780
from that, well, then you might think that

1235
00:66:23.789 --> 00:66:26.250
they're evil or insane or stupid. Right. But

1236
00:66:26.260 --> 00:66:28.119
if you see your side as not having a coherent

1237
00:66:28.128 --> 00:66:30.668
or principled philosophy, then you might be a little

1238
00:66:30.679 --> 00:66:32.769
bit softer on people who might deviate from it because

1239
00:66:32.780 --> 00:66:35.039
if they're deviating from it, maybe they're deviating from

1240
00:66:35.050 --> 00:66:38.188
it in a good way. Um Yeah, that's

1241
00:66:38.199 --> 00:66:40.648
one hopeful way of looking at it. Uh I'm

1242
00:66:40.659 --> 00:66:44.829
not optimistic about political extremists being softened by these ideas

1243
00:66:44.840 --> 00:66:47.418
, but I think it might affect uh people who

1244
00:66:47.429 --> 00:66:51.019
are a bit more moderate uh at the margins and

1245
00:66:51.030 --> 00:66:57.019
so changing topics. Now, uh in your substack

1246
00:66:57.030 --> 00:67:00.188
, you also, you have a collection of very

1247
00:67:00.199 --> 00:67:04.000
interesting uh articles there and one of them has to

1248
00:67:04.010 --> 00:67:09.280
do with the meaning of life. So, does

1249
00:67:09.289 --> 00:67:12.519
it really matter? I mean, does it matter

1250
00:67:12.530 --> 00:67:15.469
if life has some meaning or not? At least

1251
00:67:15.489 --> 00:67:21.269
to most people? Yeah, it's an interesting question

1252
00:67:21.280 --> 00:67:25.369
. Uh I think it's worth distinguishing between two different

1253
00:67:25.378 --> 00:67:27.898
kinds of meaning. Um So the meaning I'm,

1254
00:67:27.909 --> 00:67:30.179
I'm talking about in, in the post is very

1255
00:67:30.188 --> 00:67:32.449
much a highfalutin intellectual kind of, of meaning.

1256
00:67:32.760 --> 00:67:35.090
Um trying to come up with a philosophy of,

1257
00:67:35.099 --> 00:67:39.329
of, of life that is coherent. Um And

1258
00:67:39.340 --> 00:67:41.208
uh but, but there's a different kind of meaning

1259
00:67:41.519 --> 00:67:44.668
um that you might call emotional meaning. Um the

1260
00:67:44.679 --> 00:67:46.728
feeling that what you're doing uh is meaningful. And

1261
00:67:46.739 --> 00:67:49.869
I think that is very much not and has an

1262
00:67:49.878 --> 00:67:51.809
emotional sense of meaning. And even just raising a

1263
00:67:51.820 --> 00:67:55.309
family is a, is a meaningful activity. Anyone

1264
00:67:55.320 --> 00:67:57.458
who has a family will, will tell you that

1265
00:67:57.469 --> 00:68:00.119
, you know, trying to raise their kid and

1266
00:68:00.128 --> 00:68:00.539
have a good relationship with their kid is a,

1267
00:68:00.550 --> 00:68:04.523
is a meaningful project to undertake. And uh how

1268
00:68:04.534 --> 00:68:09.114
, how I think about the, the emotional aspect

1269
00:68:09.125 --> 00:68:11.773
of meaning is basically, it's evolution's way of telling

1270
00:68:11.784 --> 00:68:14.793
you that this activity is in your long term fitness

1271
00:68:14.804 --> 00:68:15.805
interests. It might not pay off right now.

1272
00:68:15.814 --> 00:68:17.614
It might not pay off immediately. It may not

1273
00:68:17.625 --> 00:68:20.015
pay off at all, but probabilistically and in the

1274
00:68:20.024 --> 00:68:24.345
long run, it's good to invest in this activity

1275
00:68:24.503 --> 00:68:26.779
. So, you know, uh if you think

1276
00:68:26.789 --> 00:68:29.539
about uh your biological fitness, it's very straightforward in

1277
00:68:29.548 --> 00:68:30.378
the case of raising a family. Um, it

1278
00:68:30.390 --> 00:68:32.958
takes a really long time to rear a child to

1279
00:68:32.970 --> 00:68:35.458
maturity and to make sure that they're successful and well

1280
00:68:35.470 --> 00:68:38.500
off and high status and gonna give you lots of

1281
00:68:38.509 --> 00:68:40.829
grandkids. Um, that's a, that's a very

1282
00:68:40.838 --> 00:68:43.609
difficult and long run project that will, that will

1283
00:68:43.619 --> 00:68:46.149
have lots of setbacks and obstacles and discomforts and pains

1284
00:68:46.159 --> 00:68:48.779
and conflicts, right? Uh Any, any parent

1285
00:68:48.789 --> 00:68:50.350
will tell you that their, that their kid can

1286
00:68:50.359 --> 00:68:51.520
be a pain in the ass and, and,

1287
00:68:51.529 --> 00:68:54.720
and you know, it's not all sunshine and rainbows

1288
00:68:55.029 --> 00:68:57.720
. So we need some kind of emotional mechanism to

1289
00:68:57.729 --> 00:69:00.208
help us weather those storms. Uh and, and

1290
00:69:00.220 --> 00:69:01.479
see the grand prize on the horizon, which is

1291
00:69:01.489 --> 00:69:03.729
, you know, uh uh rearing a, a

1292
00:69:03.739 --> 00:69:08.548
mature and successful uh uh family that will give you

1293
00:69:08.560 --> 00:69:11.578
lots of grandkids. So that, so the emotional

1294
00:69:11.587 --> 00:69:13.667
sense of meaning is something that evolution has given us

1295
00:69:13.788 --> 00:69:15.408
to get us to devote to a long term fitness

1296
00:69:15.417 --> 00:69:17.719
, beneficial projects. So raising a family is the

1297
00:69:17.729 --> 00:69:19.328
most obvious example. But there are other examples,

1298
00:69:19.337 --> 00:69:23.087
I think committing to a group, an alliance and

1299
00:69:23.099 --> 00:69:25.929
bolstering that alliance, uh making sure you know that

1300
00:69:25.938 --> 00:69:28.328
, that, that everyone is committed to the alliance

1301
00:69:28.337 --> 00:69:32.168
and purging dissenters and purging uh uh traitors from the

1302
00:69:32.180 --> 00:69:35.390
alliance and making sure that they gain power and superiority

1303
00:69:35.399 --> 00:69:38.579
and dominance over rival alliances. That is also a

1304
00:69:38.588 --> 00:69:41.970
long term project that is often beset with many setbacks

1305
00:69:41.979 --> 00:69:44.009
and obstacles. And I think many people gain a

1306
00:69:44.020 --> 00:69:46.020
lot of meaning from their, from their political uh

1307
00:69:46.029 --> 00:69:50.239
uh allegiances. Um And that can be uh either

1308
00:69:50.250 --> 00:69:51.720
a good thing or a bad thing depending on how

1309
00:69:51.729 --> 00:69:54.449
you, you want to look at it. Um

1310
00:69:54.458 --> 00:69:57.439
Cultivating a valuable skill is also a long term thing

1311
00:69:57.628 --> 00:69:59.289
uh that, that will pay off in terms of

1312
00:69:59.298 --> 00:70:01.600
raising your status. But, but maybe beset with

1313
00:70:01.890 --> 00:70:03.729
, with obstacles, helping others, you know,

1314
00:70:03.739 --> 00:70:05.918
putting others in your debt that might pay off in

1315
00:70:05.930 --> 00:70:08.189
the long run. If you're ever in need,

1316
00:70:08.199 --> 00:70:10.079
then you'll have a lot of people who feel grateful

1317
00:70:10.088 --> 00:70:12.109
for you and are willing to help you uh in

1318
00:70:12.119 --> 00:70:14.199
that situation. Uh But in order to be helped

1319
00:70:14.208 --> 00:70:16.079
in that situation, you, you must have provided

1320
00:70:16.088 --> 00:70:18.439
a lot of help to, to others before that

1321
00:70:18.609 --> 00:70:21.909
. And so that's why helping others uh feels meaningful

1322
00:70:23.668 --> 00:70:24.909
. So that's emotional meaning. Sorry, I went

1323
00:70:24.918 --> 00:70:29.989
on a very long tangent there. That's um yeah

1324
00:70:30.048 --> 00:70:30.449
. Uh So I didn't talk about this in the

1325
00:70:30.458 --> 00:70:32.199
piece. I probably should have. Maybe this is

1326
00:70:32.208 --> 00:70:34.509
a separate piece that's emotional meaning. I don't think

1327
00:70:34.520 --> 00:70:35.939
that is unique to intellectuals. I think we all

1328
00:70:35.949 --> 00:70:40.560
have emotional meaning. I think that's a biological adaptation

1329
00:70:40.798 --> 00:70:45.180
. Then there's intellectual meaning that is uh what we

1330
00:70:45.189 --> 00:70:47.529
think is objectively meaningful. That is what we think

1331
00:70:47.539 --> 00:70:51.829
is rationally defensible as, as meaningful. Um What

1332
00:70:51.838 --> 00:70:57.628
we think the uh coherent and principled uh answer is

1333
00:70:57.668 --> 00:70:59.149
to, to the meaning of life. What are

1334
00:70:59.159 --> 00:71:00.500
, what are actual reasons are for, for living

1335
00:71:00.509 --> 00:71:03.029
and caring for families and supporting our, our political

1336
00:71:03.039 --> 00:71:06.970
tribe uh that uh is very much unique to intellectuals

1337
00:71:06.979 --> 00:71:09.668
. At least in my personal experience I could be

1338
00:71:09.680 --> 00:71:11.529
wrong. You know, I'm, I'm happy to

1339
00:71:11.539 --> 00:71:13.729
see some data challenging me, but it seems like

1340
00:71:13.739 --> 00:71:15.720
if you poll the general population and you ask them

1341
00:71:15.949 --> 00:71:18.798
, you know, how much they think about existentialism

1342
00:71:18.810 --> 00:71:23.329
or nihilism or Camu or Sarre or how much they

1343
00:71:23.338 --> 00:71:24.939
, they try to, how much they care about

1344
00:71:24.949 --> 00:71:29.310
having a coherent uh uh worldview or philosophy. I

1345
00:71:29.319 --> 00:71:31.720
would bet you that you would see uh uh highly

1346
00:71:31.729 --> 00:71:34.520
educated people uh answering yes to those questions at a

1347
00:71:34.529 --> 00:71:38.250
much higher frequency. Uh And so, in that

1348
00:71:38.259 --> 00:71:40.899
sense, I don't think most people care about the

1349
00:71:40.909 --> 00:71:44.250
meaning of life. Um in, in that intellectual

1350
00:71:44.259 --> 00:71:47.100
sense, you know, whenever I think about the

1351
00:71:47.149 --> 00:71:51.539
uh intellectual kind of meaning of life, you were

1352
00:71:51.548 --> 00:71:56.759
just referring to there every time it comes to my

1353
00:71:56.770 --> 00:72:00.369
mind that uh Socratic uh uh, that, that

1354
00:72:00.378 --> 00:72:03.899
quote from Socrates where he says something along the lines

1355
00:72:04.149 --> 00:72:10.159
, the unexamined life is not worth living. That

1356
00:72:10.199 --> 00:72:13.289
like, really is that, is, that,

1357
00:72:13.298 --> 00:72:15.878
is, is really life just about, I don't

1358
00:72:15.890 --> 00:72:21.250
know, overthinking. Yeah. I, I find

1359
00:72:21.259 --> 00:72:26.020
it really surprising that intellectual sort of hold that quote

1360
00:72:26.029 --> 00:72:29.689
in reverence to me that's kind of, I find

1361
00:72:29.699 --> 00:72:31.529
it really kind of disgusting quote to be perfectly honest

1362
00:72:31.539 --> 00:72:34.029
. I find it elitist, uh, and,

1363
00:72:34.039 --> 00:72:38.458
and, and smugly superior. It's an implicit dig

1364
00:72:38.470 --> 00:72:40.729
at people who don't spend their whole life philosophizing.

1365
00:72:40.739 --> 00:72:43.430
It's basically saying that those people, their lives aren't

1366
00:72:43.439 --> 00:72:46.878
worth living. That's a terrible sentiment. Absolutely despicable

1367
00:72:46.890 --> 00:72:48.079
when you, when you really think about it.

1368
00:72:48.088 --> 00:72:50.470
So, it, it, it continuously surprises me

1369
00:72:50.479 --> 00:72:55.149
that intellectuals hold up this quote as a, you

1370
00:72:55.159 --> 00:72:57.079
know, as this symbol of, of meaning and

1371
00:72:57.088 --> 00:73:00.069
virtue. I think it's just, um, smug

1372
00:73:00.369 --> 00:73:02.319
elitism, uh, masquerading as, as, uh

1373
00:73:02.329 --> 00:73:04.989
, as philosophy. Yeah. But, uh,

1374
00:73:05.000 --> 00:73:09.168
I, I mean, going on with the cynicism

1375
00:73:09.180 --> 00:73:12.798
here, I guess so when it comes to the

1376
00:73:12.810 --> 00:73:15.770
meaning of life and other sorts of, for example

1377
00:73:15.779 --> 00:73:21.918
, existential questions that uh highly intellectual, over educated

1378
00:73:21.930 --> 00:73:27.759
people uh care about. I mean, do you

1379
00:73:27.770 --> 00:73:31.509
have any idea if they really do care about them

1380
00:73:31.520 --> 00:73:36.949
for the sake of acquiring some sort of knowledge about

1381
00:73:36.958 --> 00:73:42.069
particular kinds of questions, or do you think that

1382
00:73:42.079 --> 00:73:45.390
they like to discuss them among themselves, mostly for

1383
00:73:45.399 --> 00:73:51.189
the sake of social signaling, showing off their intellect

1384
00:73:51.199 --> 00:73:55.798
and stuff like that? Yeah. So uh I

1385
00:73:55.810 --> 00:73:58.149
, I would argue that that the answer is,

1386
00:73:58.159 --> 00:74:00.890
is very much the latter. Um I, I

1387
00:74:00.899 --> 00:74:02.020
don't mean to upset anyone, but I do think

1388
00:74:02.029 --> 00:74:05.100
this is the, the best explanation uh for,

1389
00:74:05.109 --> 00:74:08.829
for what's going on here, which isn't to say

1390
00:74:08.838 --> 00:74:10.798
that, you know, I look down upon this

1391
00:74:10.810 --> 00:74:12.989
, I engage in it myself. I love philosophizing

1392
00:74:13.000 --> 00:74:14.298
about the meaning of life. I, I,

1393
00:74:14.569 --> 00:74:18.319
me too. I have almost 300 philosophy interviews on

1394
00:74:18.359 --> 00:74:21.819
the show. So, yeah. So just because

1395
00:74:21.829 --> 00:74:26.149
I'm describing this as kind of social signaling um and

1396
00:74:26.159 --> 00:74:28.168
, and bullshit doesn't mean that it's, it's bad

1397
00:74:28.180 --> 00:74:29.560
or I don't like it. I actually love it

1398
00:74:29.569 --> 00:74:32.329
that I'm kind of attacking myself here. Um But

1399
00:74:32.338 --> 00:74:34.208
I do think it's a kind of BS um I

1400
00:74:34.220 --> 00:74:39.359
don't think that um the human mind has an innate

1401
00:74:39.369 --> 00:74:43.588
or, or deep seated desire for truth about abstract

1402
00:74:43.600 --> 00:74:46.039
, irrelevant uh matters. I think we certainly have

1403
00:74:46.048 --> 00:74:49.720
evolved a desire for truth and concrete, practical relevant

1404
00:74:50.048 --> 00:74:53.239
situations. That is we want to know if there

1405
00:74:53.250 --> 00:74:54.750
really is a tiger over there. We want to

1406
00:74:54.759 --> 00:74:56.949
know if this canoe really has a hole in it

1407
00:74:56.958 --> 00:74:58.729
or not. We really want to know if our

1408
00:74:58.739 --> 00:75:00.609
tool works or if this food is safe to eat

1409
00:75:00.640 --> 00:75:01.399
. Those are the kinds of things that we evolved

1410
00:75:01.409 --> 00:75:02.909
to care about and, and, and evolved to

1411
00:75:02.918 --> 00:75:05.220
care about having accurate beliefs about. But when it

1412
00:75:05.229 --> 00:75:09.329
comes to the meaning of life, how on earth

1413
00:75:09.338 --> 00:75:11.869
would that affect your fitness in any way? Why

1414
00:75:11.878 --> 00:75:14.548
would we care about having a correct view of that

1415
00:75:14.720 --> 00:75:17.970
? That strikes me as a very evolutionarily implausible desire

1416
00:75:18.259 --> 00:75:20.899
. So I think if we're going to explain discourse

1417
00:75:20.909 --> 00:75:24.069
on the meaning of life, we cannot appeal to

1418
00:75:24.079 --> 00:75:28.279
any deep seated motive for truth seeking and in these

1419
00:75:28.289 --> 00:75:29.298
, in these matters, I think we have to

1420
00:75:29.310 --> 00:75:30.259
look in other directions. I think we have to

1421
00:75:30.270 --> 00:75:33.958
look to the social aspect of these debates because after

1422
00:75:33.970 --> 00:75:35.914
all debates are social, they are not just,

1423
00:75:35.923 --> 00:75:40.604
you know, one individual thinking to himself or herself

1424
00:75:40.614 --> 00:75:43.345
. Uh If that's what uh you know, pondering

1425
00:75:43.354 --> 00:75:45.854
the meaning of life was like, uh it would

1426
00:75:45.864 --> 00:75:46.784
be unrecognizable to us. No, this, these

1427
00:75:46.793 --> 00:75:49.274
, these discussions are very social. Uh they have

1428
00:75:49.284 --> 00:75:51.345
all sorts of, of social implications, all sorts

1429
00:75:51.354 --> 00:75:55.869
of status implications. Um We tend to praise people

1430
00:75:55.878 --> 00:75:58.338
who have, you know, well thought out uplifting

1431
00:75:58.350 --> 00:76:00.338
um philosophies of life as, as humane, as

1432
00:76:00.350 --> 00:76:03.020
, as wise, as virtuous and we really seek

1433
00:76:03.029 --> 00:76:05.810
that kind of acclaim and, and esteem from our

1434
00:76:05.819 --> 00:76:09.739
peers. I think philosophers love that kind of acclaim

1435
00:76:09.750 --> 00:76:12.739
. They love to be called wise and humane and

1436
00:76:12.750 --> 00:76:15.649
, and insightful. Um So I think the key

1437
00:76:15.659 --> 00:76:16.208
here is, is thinking about, you know,

1438
00:76:16.220 --> 00:76:19.199
what an intellectual is, what is an over educated

1439
00:76:19.208 --> 00:76:21.970
person, what trait makes them that way. And

1440
00:76:21.979 --> 00:76:26.229
I think the clearest answer is that they are hyper

1441
00:76:26.279 --> 00:76:31.909
reasoners, their reasoning faculty is uh uh very online

1442
00:76:31.970 --> 00:76:36.489
uh and intensely activated uh all the time. That's

1443
00:76:36.500 --> 00:76:38.899
what I think in, in like there are people

1444
00:76:38.909 --> 00:76:41.989
who love to reason and we all have reasoning faculties

1445
00:76:42.000 --> 00:76:43.069
. Some of us have, you know, you

1446
00:76:43.079 --> 00:76:45.119
know, stronger reasoning faculties and we like to reason

1447
00:76:45.128 --> 00:76:47.119
more frequently than others, but we all have it

1448
00:76:47.430 --> 00:76:50.939
. Uh And uh and I think to understand why

1449
00:76:50.949 --> 00:76:53.680
intellectuals debate the meaning of life, we have to

1450
00:76:53.689 --> 00:76:55.829
understand what reasoning is and what it's all about and

1451
00:76:55.838 --> 00:76:58.708
why reasoning evolved. Um And the theory I like

1452
00:76:58.720 --> 00:77:00.390
most about what reasoning is uh comes from Hugo Mercier

1453
00:77:00.409 --> 00:77:02.759
, who I believe you've had on the podcast before

1454
00:77:03.609 --> 00:77:08.180
. And he thinks that reasoning evolved for two purposes

1455
00:77:08.189 --> 00:77:11.689
, one is arguing and the other is rationalizing.

1456
00:77:11.949 --> 00:77:15.020
So we reason to win debates uh and resolve conflicts

1457
00:77:15.029 --> 00:77:18.298
in our favor. Um And we also reason to

1458
00:77:18.310 --> 00:77:23.020
excuse justify and rationalize our behavior so that we look

1459
00:77:23.029 --> 00:77:25.470
good to our peers. That's basically what reasoning is

1460
00:77:25.479 --> 00:77:28.759
all about according to, to uh Hugo Mercier.

1461
00:77:29.560 --> 00:77:31.100
Um There are all sorts of nuances here. And

1462
00:77:31.109 --> 00:77:32.458
II, I don't want to give a whole overview

1463
00:77:32.470 --> 00:77:34.619
of his theory, but that's the gist. Um

1464
00:77:34.628 --> 00:77:39.189
And uh if we see reasoning as fundamentally about arguing

1465
00:77:39.199 --> 00:77:41.439
and rationalizing, then we can see why these hyper

1466
00:77:41.739 --> 00:77:44.298
reasoning weirdos are so obsessed with the meaning of life

1467
00:77:44.310 --> 00:77:45.284
. What they're doing is they're finding a way to

1468
00:77:45.293 --> 00:77:48.204
win arguments with one another and rationalize their lives.

1469
00:77:48.414 --> 00:77:51.515
That is they're trying to come up with a justification

1470
00:77:51.524 --> 00:77:54.793
for, for their life choices, the, you

1471
00:77:54.805 --> 00:77:58.003
know, the justification for why they support the uh

1472
00:77:58.145 --> 00:78:01.708
haphazard and arbitrary political coalition, they support uh they're

1473
00:78:01.720 --> 00:78:04.720
trying to come up with a rationalization for why they're

1474
00:78:04.729 --> 00:78:06.579
alive at all. Uh You know, that's,

1475
00:78:06.588 --> 00:78:09.319
that's a big question, you know, why don't

1476
00:78:09.329 --> 00:78:11.600
, why don't we commit suicide? Uh I think

1477
00:78:11.609 --> 00:78:13.869
the answer is there are, there are clear evolutionary

1478
00:78:13.878 --> 00:78:15.759
reasons why we would be afraid of committing suicide.

1479
00:78:15.029 --> 00:78:17.500
Uh But that doesn't sound as pretty as, oh

1480
00:78:17.509 --> 00:78:19.668
, I'm alive because I want to pursue some high

1481
00:78:19.680 --> 00:78:21.890
minded value or I want to make the world a

1482
00:78:21.899 --> 00:78:26.640
better place or pursue justice or equality or um or

1483
00:78:26.649 --> 00:78:30.878
any other uh value. So I think basically what

1484
00:78:30.890 --> 00:78:32.208
, what uh conversations and debates about the meaning of

1485
00:78:32.220 --> 00:78:33.798
life are, are, are a kind of status

1486
00:78:33.810 --> 00:78:36.878
competition. Uh And the status competition might take a

1487
00:78:36.890 --> 00:78:40.850
variety of forms. Um uh It might take the

1488
00:78:40.859 --> 00:78:42.949
form of virtue, status or, or wisdom,

1489
00:78:42.958 --> 00:78:45.810
status um or, or, or whatever, but

1490
00:78:45.819 --> 00:78:48.640
I think that's ultimately what it's all about uh and

1491
00:78:48.649 --> 00:78:50.720
uh apologies for that cynical view. But I think

1492
00:78:50.729 --> 00:78:54.168
it might help with uh with existential angst to realize

1493
00:78:54.180 --> 00:78:57.810
that your existential angst is uh sometimes uh bullshit.

1494
00:78:59.020 --> 00:79:00.779
No, I mean, at least as far as

1495
00:79:00.789 --> 00:79:03.109
I'm concerned, we do not have to apologize at

1496
00:79:03.119 --> 00:79:06.319
all also because I mean, o of course,

1497
00:79:06.329 --> 00:79:11.509
again, uh it's fine uh to be interested in

1498
00:79:11.520 --> 00:79:14.619
all these sorts of questions and I am interested in

1499
00:79:14.628 --> 00:79:17.159
them myself and I explore them on the show several

1500
00:79:17.168 --> 00:79:20.000
times. So, but uh I guess that the

1501
00:79:20.009 --> 00:79:25.739
BS part here is really about the fact that people

1502
00:79:26.289 --> 00:79:30.289
and it's not their fault to some extent because most

1503
00:79:30.298 --> 00:79:33.750
of these happens subconsciously. So people are not really

1504
00:79:33.759 --> 00:79:40.789
do not really have direct access to what's motivating them

1505
00:79:41.029 --> 00:79:43.989
to perform a particular kind of behavior in this case

1506
00:79:44.000 --> 00:79:47.359
showing off intellectually, for example. Uh but the

1507
00:79:47.369 --> 00:79:51.579
BS is really about them thinking that the arguments they're

1508
00:79:51.588 --> 00:79:56.015
making uh the law they bring to the table.

1509
00:79:56.024 --> 00:79:59.824
And all of that is really about the content of

1510
00:79:59.833 --> 00:80:02.744
what they're saying and not about, for example,

1511
00:80:02.975 --> 00:80:12.564
increasing their status or uh so socially signaling their intellectual

1512
00:80:12.574 --> 00:80:15.923
prowess or something like that also, because lots of

1513
00:80:15.935 --> 00:80:21.784
that uh as a clear fitness benefits. Right.

1514
00:80:23.409 --> 00:80:25.750
Yes, exactly. Yeah. If we're trying to

1515
00:80:25.759 --> 00:80:30.548
explain AAA costly human behavior, a costly investment of

1516
00:80:30.560 --> 00:80:31.970
time and energy, I think we have to try

1517
00:80:31.979 --> 00:80:34.829
to explain it first in ways that make evolutionary sense

1518
00:80:34.838 --> 00:80:36.689
and the way you describe it as social signaling and

1519
00:80:36.699 --> 00:80:40.298
status competition, that makes a whole lot of evolutionary

1520
00:80:40.310 --> 00:80:42.779
sense. The idea that we are intrinsically interested in

1521
00:80:42.789 --> 00:80:45.149
the abstract meaning of life for its own sake makes

1522
00:80:45.159 --> 00:80:46.739
no evolutionary sense whatsoever. So I think all else

1523
00:80:46.750 --> 00:80:49.350
equal, we should favor the theories and explanations that

1524
00:80:49.359 --> 00:80:51.949
make more evolutionary sense because we know evolution is true

1525
00:80:53.189 --> 00:80:55.109
. Uh And all of our theories should ultimately be

1526
00:80:55.119 --> 00:80:57.689
consistent with it. And that's, that's my pitch

1527
00:80:57.699 --> 00:81:00.529
for Darwinian cynicism. At the end of the day

1528
00:81:00.539 --> 00:81:03.810
, the question would be if there was no social

1529
00:81:03.819 --> 00:81:08.899
aspect to any of these, would you still really

1530
00:81:08.909 --> 00:81:13.759
be interested in thinking about the meaning of life or

1531
00:81:13.770 --> 00:81:16.569
arguing about the meaning of life and other questions like

1532
00:81:16.579 --> 00:81:19.279
that? Right? It's, it's interesting. Uh

1533
00:81:19.395 --> 00:81:21.784
Part of me wants to say yes and part of

1534
00:81:21.793 --> 00:81:24.614
me wants to say no because I know my own

1535
00:81:24.625 --> 00:81:27.774
inner press secretary wants me to deny that I'm,

1536
00:81:27.784 --> 00:81:30.774
I'm motivated by these ugly things but, but my

1537
00:81:30.784 --> 00:81:32.753
rational intellectual brain says yes, of course. Um

1538
00:81:32.765 --> 00:81:35.034
So, uh yes, ultimately, I'm a human

1539
00:81:35.043 --> 00:81:38.524
being too. Um I'm just as motivated by these

1540
00:81:38.534 --> 00:81:41.253
uh social signaling and status motivations as any other human

1541
00:81:41.305 --> 00:81:43.015
. And I'm just as motivated to deny that I

1542
00:81:43.024 --> 00:81:45.838
have these motivations as any. I think that's a

1543
00:81:45.850 --> 00:81:46.949
big part of a big part of our, of

1544
00:81:46.958 --> 00:81:49.479
our status competition. Is denying that we're competing for

1545
00:81:49.489 --> 00:81:53.060
status because if you come out as a status seeker

1546
00:81:53.069 --> 00:81:56.759
, as a social climber, as a vous narcissist

1547
00:81:57.020 --> 00:81:58.378
, uh you're going to look bad, you're going

1548
00:81:58.390 --> 00:82:00.470
to lose status. So overtly seeking status lowers your

1549
00:82:00.479 --> 00:82:02.890
status, which means that we have to seek status

1550
00:82:02.989 --> 00:82:05.869
covertly and we have to be in denial about it

1551
00:82:05.958 --> 00:82:08.878
. We have to come up with pretty uh uh

1552
00:82:08.890 --> 00:82:12.600
rationalizations and self flattering stories about what we're really pursuing

1553
00:82:12.609 --> 00:82:14.470
, which is not status but some high minded,

1554
00:82:14.479 --> 00:82:17.329
sacred value like truth or justice or beauty or authenticity

1555
00:82:17.338 --> 00:82:19.378
or whatever. Um And that's where a lot of

1556
00:82:19.390 --> 00:82:20.979
our bullshit comes from, I think is, is

1557
00:82:20.989 --> 00:82:24.659
trying to cover up the ugly facts of our status

1558
00:82:24.668 --> 00:82:30.088
competition and uh present them as pretty and impartially altruistic

1559
00:82:30.100 --> 00:82:32.020
and benevolent uh ironically for the purpose of winning those

1560
00:82:32.029 --> 00:82:35.829
very same status competitions. Yeah. And perhaps even

1561
00:82:35.838 --> 00:82:41.470
this entire conversation is just boils down to status seeking

1562
00:82:43.338 --> 00:82:45.079
ultimately. Sadly, yes, which isn't to say

1563
00:82:45.088 --> 00:82:45.729
it's bad. So one thing I've, I've,

1564
00:82:45.739 --> 00:82:47.739
I'm coming to terms with is that just because something

1565
00:82:47.750 --> 00:82:49.708
is bullshit or, or is a status game doesn't

1566
00:82:49.720 --> 00:82:53.270
mean it's bad. Uh Because if, if I

1567
00:82:53.279 --> 00:82:54.659
were to take that view, then I would have

1568
00:82:54.668 --> 00:82:56.430
to think that everything is, is bad and that

1569
00:82:56.439 --> 00:82:59.949
is, is, is an unlivable philosophy. So

1570
00:82:59.958 --> 00:83:00.569
I, the way I think about it is yes

1571
00:83:00.579 --> 00:83:02.088
, what we're, what we're doing here is ultimately

1572
00:83:02.100 --> 00:83:04.378
a kind of status game that doesn't mean it's bad

1573
00:83:04.390 --> 00:83:06.020
and that doesn't mean it's not useful and it doesn't

1574
00:83:06.029 --> 00:83:08.750
mean it's not improving the world in some way.

1575
00:83:08.789 --> 00:83:10.850
Certainly we're going to be biased to think that it's

1576
00:83:10.859 --> 00:83:12.699
useful and that it's improving the world in, in

1577
00:83:12.708 --> 00:83:14.399
, in some way. Uh, but just because

1578
00:83:14.409 --> 00:83:15.220
we're biased to think that doesn't mean it's, it's

1579
00:83:15.229 --> 00:83:19.579
not true. So, another thing that you wrote

1580
00:83:19.588 --> 00:83:24.509
about in one of your posts, uh is,

1581
00:83:24.520 --> 00:83:28.250
uh and earlier, I've asked you about this,

1582
00:83:28.259 --> 00:83:30.409
at least to some extent when I asked you about

1583
00:83:30.418 --> 00:83:35.750
moral foundations theory. But what function the morality serve

1584
00:83:35.759 --> 00:83:40.649
exactly because we have this idea or this common idea

1585
00:83:40.659 --> 00:83:45.680
that morality is really about making us good or better

1586
00:83:45.689 --> 00:83:49.409
people. But is that really what morality is about

1587
00:83:50.708 --> 00:83:53.939
? Yeah. So I don't think it's what it's

1588
00:83:53.989 --> 00:83:56.208
uh about. Um So I have a, a

1589
00:83:56.220 --> 00:83:59.500
post on everything is bullshit called morality is not nice

1590
00:84:00.088 --> 00:84:01.199
. Uh In which I argue that morality is not

1591
00:84:01.208 --> 00:84:03.378
, in fact nice. Uh It's quite mean.

1592
00:84:03.390 --> 00:84:06.579
Um If you think about all of the awful stuff

1593
00:84:06.588 --> 00:84:10.310
that has happened throughout history, uh It has all

1594
00:84:10.319 --> 00:84:14.250
had a very high minded moral justification, purges pogroms

1595
00:84:14.259 --> 00:84:17.378
, inquisitions, genocides, um Eugenics, uh uh

1596
00:84:17.390 --> 00:84:24.039
uh conquests, colonialization. Um uh you name it

1597
00:84:24.338 --> 00:84:28.458
, it all comes accompanied with immoral justification. We

1598
00:84:28.470 --> 00:84:31.500
cannot commit injustice without thinking we're pursuing justice, we

1599
00:84:31.509 --> 00:84:36.208
cannot behave immorally without thinking we're behaving morally. Uh

1600
00:84:36.220 --> 00:84:42.060
We need our moral justifications and our moral rationalizations in

1601
00:84:42.069 --> 00:84:48.229
order to effectively mobilize groups against rivals. Um So

1602
00:84:48.239 --> 00:84:51.298
that is what I think a lot of morality is

1603
00:84:51.310 --> 00:84:57.588
about. Um it's about mobilizing groups against rivals.

1604
00:84:57.600 --> 00:85:00.729
And the way we do that is by creating self

1605
00:85:00.739 --> 00:85:03.529
serving narratives that frame the group as morally superior and

1606
00:85:03.539 --> 00:85:10.119
the rivals as morally inferior. Um And uh I

1607
00:85:10.128 --> 00:85:14.029
think way too much of the scholarly literature on morality

1608
00:85:14.039 --> 00:85:17.029
takes an overly sunny view of what it's all about

1609
00:85:17.449 --> 00:85:19.628
. Um That is if you think about morality from

1610
00:85:19.640 --> 00:85:23.739
a Darwinian perspective, ultimately, it exists because it

1611
00:85:23.750 --> 00:85:27.239
, it helped our ancestors out compete their rivals.

1612
00:85:27.250 --> 00:85:30.189
That is uh ancestors who had the genes for morality

1613
00:85:30.199 --> 00:85:32.119
did better, got more stuff than ancestors who didn't

1614
00:85:32.128 --> 00:85:34.619
have those genes. And then you have to ask

1615
00:85:34.628 --> 00:85:36.418
yourself, well, how did they get more stuff

1616
00:85:36.430 --> 00:85:39.909
than their non moral rivals? Well, there are

1617
00:85:39.918 --> 00:85:41.640
only so many ways, right? They could either

1618
00:85:41.649 --> 00:85:44.878
physically exclude them from that stuff, just, just

1619
00:85:44.890 --> 00:85:46.109
uh not interact with them or, or, or

1620
00:85:46.119 --> 00:85:48.789
just avoid them. That's not very nice. They

1621
00:85:48.798 --> 00:85:51.529
could uh violently exclude them, they could hurt them

1622
00:85:51.539 --> 00:85:55.869
or kill them, not very nice. Um They

1623
00:85:55.878 --> 00:85:58.189
could lie to them and, and to, to

1624
00:85:58.350 --> 00:86:00.149
keep them away. That that's another tactic. Uh

1625
00:86:00.159 --> 00:86:03.649
Really, there's no way that one group of primates

1626
00:86:03.659 --> 00:86:06.289
can get more stuff than another group of primates systematically

1627
00:86:06.298 --> 00:86:10.579
throughout evolutionary history without being mean to that other group

1628
00:86:10.588 --> 00:86:12.220
of primates. There's just no way to do it

1629
00:86:12.449 --> 00:86:14.310
. So I think morality, while it is very

1630
00:86:14.319 --> 00:86:15.039
much about cooper operation, as a lot of scholars

1631
00:86:15.048 --> 00:86:18.750
have argued, it also must necessarily have a competitive

1632
00:86:18.759 --> 00:86:23.140
side. That is there must be some kind of

1633
00:86:23.149 --> 00:86:25.359
competition at the heart of it. Yes, we

1634
00:86:25.369 --> 00:86:29.239
co-operate, but we co-operate to outcompete our rivals.

1635
00:86:29.250 --> 00:86:31.048
Yes, we try to be to, to show

1636
00:86:31.060 --> 00:86:32.979
off our virtue and to, and to be good

1637
00:86:32.989 --> 00:86:34.699
cooper partners. But what we're doing there is we're

1638
00:86:34.708 --> 00:86:39.869
competing with other people to be better co-operative partners than

1639
00:86:39.878 --> 00:86:42.039
they are. And I think too often the competitive

1640
00:86:42.048 --> 00:86:44.475
side of morality has been ignored in favor of the

1641
00:86:44.484 --> 00:86:46.814
co-operative side. Ironically, because that serves the functions

1642
00:86:46.824 --> 00:86:49.395
of morality. That is if I'm trying to mobilize

1643
00:86:49.404 --> 00:86:53.324
a larger group than my rivals, I have to

1644
00:86:53.333 --> 00:86:55.555
make it seem like my moral agenda is better for

1645
00:86:55.564 --> 00:86:57.704
more people than it really is that it's more sunny

1646
00:86:57.713 --> 00:87:00.463
and co-operative than it really is that it's less ugly

1647
00:87:00.475 --> 00:87:01.574
and dark and competitive than it really is in order

1648
00:87:01.583 --> 00:87:04.354
to rally more people to my side and away from

1649
00:87:04.515 --> 00:87:09.588
the other side. So that's what I think uh

1650
00:87:10.000 --> 00:87:12.779
morality is about at the end of the day.

1651
00:87:13.168 --> 00:87:15.579
Um It's just as much about competition as it is

1652
00:87:15.588 --> 00:87:16.939
about cooper operation and it is, I think the

1653
00:87:16.949 --> 00:87:19.338
leading cause of immorality in our species. I think

1654
00:87:19.350 --> 00:87:21.819
it is the leading cause of cruelty of violence.

1655
00:87:23.048 --> 00:87:26.189
Uh There's an excellent book called Virtuous Violence by uh

1656
00:87:26.289 --> 00:87:29.739
Lan Fis Conte Re arguing. Uh, that pretty

1657
00:87:29.750 --> 00:87:32.140
much all violence around the world has a moral justification

1658
00:87:32.539 --> 00:87:34.470
. It's all done in the name of morality.

1659
00:87:34.479 --> 00:87:38.509
And that far more violence is done by normal people

1660
00:87:38.520 --> 00:87:41.000
who think they're doing the right thing than, uh

1661
00:87:41.048 --> 00:87:45.119
, is committed by sociopaths. Um, and so

1662
00:87:45.128 --> 00:87:46.810
I think we really need to have a reckoning with

1663
00:87:46.819 --> 00:87:49.180
morality. Uh, and the role it plays in

1664
00:87:49.189 --> 00:87:51.369
our society. Mhm. Yeah, I, I

1665
00:87:51.378 --> 00:87:55.149
mean, I was just about to mention that book

1666
00:87:55.159 --> 00:87:59.189
Virtues Violence and I talked about about it with Alan

1667
00:87:59.199 --> 00:88:02.039
Fisk back in late 2018 or early 2019, something

1668
00:88:02.048 --> 00:88:04.378
like that on the show. Uh And yeah,

1669
00:88:04.390 --> 00:88:08.689
it's, it's a very compelling argument that he and

1670
00:88:08.699 --> 00:88:11.569
his co-author make there, right? But that,

1671
00:88:11.899 --> 00:88:15.259
I mean, when, for example, uh you

1672
00:88:15.270 --> 00:88:18.770
want to uh take revenge or something like that and

1673
00:88:18.779 --> 00:88:26.770
you morally justify your revenge or you base some sort

1674
00:88:26.779 --> 00:88:31.619
of uh individual or collective action on morality and on

1675
00:88:31.628 --> 00:88:36.364
being wronged, for example, that uh more easily

1676
00:88:36.375 --> 00:88:41.944
can lead, you can lead you and your fellow

1677
00:88:42.114 --> 00:88:46.673
, I mean, allies to commit atrocious acts,

1678
00:88:46.685 --> 00:88:49.345
right? Like for example, even in some cases

1679
00:88:49.354 --> 00:88:55.060
, genocide and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah

1680
00:88:55.069 --> 00:88:59.560
, absolutely. Um I, I have no descent

1681
00:88:59.569 --> 00:89:03.569
to your opinion. OK. So let's get into

1682
00:89:03.579 --> 00:89:06.939
one of the last topics here. So earlier you

1683
00:89:06.949 --> 00:89:12.048
mentioned at a certain point, social paradoxes. So

1684
00:89:12.060 --> 00:89:15.458
what, what are social paradoxes? What does that

1685
00:89:15.470 --> 00:89:17.949
mean? Exactly. Yeah. So it's, it's

1686
00:89:17.958 --> 00:89:21.100
usually good to give a few examples of social paradoxes

1687
00:89:21.109 --> 00:89:23.838
rather than, than give you the definition. I

1688
00:89:23.850 --> 00:89:25.918
think that'll be easier to understand what it is.

1689
00:89:25.930 --> 00:89:27.128
I'm talking about. So here, I'll give you

1690
00:89:27.140 --> 00:89:31.180
a few examples. Um We um try very hard

1691
00:89:31.189 --> 00:89:33.850
to make people think that we don't care what they

1692
00:89:33.859 --> 00:89:41.529
think. Um We uh rebel against social norms in

1693
00:89:41.539 --> 00:89:45.180
the exact same way as everyone else. Um We

1694
00:89:45.189 --> 00:89:48.239
uh authentically express our true selves, not who society

1695
00:89:48.250 --> 00:89:51.838
wants us to be because that is ultimately who society

1696
00:89:51.850 --> 00:89:58.418
wants us to be. Um We uh um oppose

1697
00:89:58.430 --> 00:90:02.720
virtue signaling to signal our virtue. Uh We um

1698
00:90:02.729 --> 00:90:06.829
bravely defy social norms so that people will praise us

1699
00:90:08.458 --> 00:90:14.149
. Um We uh um avoid being manipulative um to

1700
00:90:14.159 --> 00:90:15.369
get people to do what we want them to do

1701
00:90:16.270 --> 00:90:21.640
. Uh We uh where we avoid being defensive uh

1702
00:90:21.649 --> 00:90:26.009
in order to ultimately defend ourselves. Uh Those are

1703
00:90:26.020 --> 00:90:28.180
just a few examples of social paradoxes. What's the

1704
00:90:28.189 --> 00:90:30.899
common thread to all of them? The common thread

1705
00:90:30.279 --> 00:90:34.789
is that they ultimately involve a uh a signal that

1706
00:90:34.798 --> 00:90:40.039
is concealed from both the signaler and the recipient.

1707
00:90:40.759 --> 00:90:44.128
That is the virtue signaler does not know that they

1708
00:90:44.140 --> 00:90:47.470
are a virtue signaler. Uh And neither do the

1709
00:90:47.479 --> 00:90:50.729
recipients who award them virtue. If they thought of

1710
00:90:50.739 --> 00:90:53.789
them as virtue signalers, they wouldn't award them virtue

1711
00:90:53.798 --> 00:90:54.909
, they would think they were, you know,

1712
00:90:54.918 --> 00:90:58.359
narcissistic or, or whatever, right? Um The

1713
00:90:58.369 --> 00:91:00.899
brave norm, violator does not know that they're actually

1714
00:91:00.909 --> 00:91:02.619
, in fact, just conforming to the norms of

1715
00:91:02.628 --> 00:91:05.279
their particular subculture. And neither do the members of

1716
00:91:05.289 --> 00:91:09.958
that subculture, the authentic person who's authentically expressing their

1717
00:91:09.970 --> 00:91:12.180
true self, uh, does not know that they're

1718
00:91:12.189 --> 00:91:15.060
behaving exactly how society wants them to behave and neither

1719
00:91:15.069 --> 00:91:17.588
does the society who praises them as authentic. Right

1720
00:91:17.699 --> 00:91:20.060
. So these are signals being sent that are concealed

1721
00:91:20.069 --> 00:91:24.878
from both the signaler and the recipient. A and

1722
00:91:24.890 --> 00:91:30.270
so why is it that uh things like status seeking

1723
00:91:30.279 --> 00:91:34.539
and virtue signaling have to occur uh covertly for them

1724
00:91:34.548 --> 00:91:38.750
to work? Yeah. So the answer is kind

1725
00:91:38.759 --> 00:91:40.609
of complicated. Uh So I think it has to

1726
00:91:40.619 --> 00:91:44.989
do with um are a couple of cognitive abilities.

1727
00:91:45.000 --> 00:91:48.239
We have one ability is that we are just eagerly

1728
00:91:48.250 --> 00:91:51.350
in search of information about a person's character. We

1729
00:91:51.359 --> 00:91:54.060
are, are, you know, likely to draw

1730
00:91:54.069 --> 00:91:57.039
all sorts of inferences about them from the subtlest things

1731
00:91:57.048 --> 00:91:58.470
they say are and, and, and the subtlest

1732
00:91:58.479 --> 00:92:00.020
behaviors they engage in. Uh we, we want

1733
00:92:00.029 --> 00:92:02.539
to know what kind of person I want to know

1734
00:92:02.548 --> 00:92:03.720
what kind of person you are. And I'm going

1735
00:92:03.729 --> 00:92:05.619
to judge you in all sorts of ways unconsciously,

1736
00:92:05.628 --> 00:92:09.208
unconsciously and draw inferences, you know, you said

1737
00:92:09.220 --> 00:92:10.989
this thing that means that you're this type of person

1738
00:92:11.439 --> 00:92:13.659
. So that's what I call QE based inferences using

1739
00:92:13.668 --> 00:92:15.229
others behaviors as a cue to their, their underlying

1740
00:92:15.239 --> 00:92:18.729
traits. Uh And then there's uh recursive mentalis.

1741
00:92:18.739 --> 00:92:20.989
So that's the ability to get inside other other people's

1742
00:92:21.000 --> 00:92:24.579
heads. Um and think about what, what they

1743
00:92:24.588 --> 00:92:27.509
might be thinking about, uh uh or what they

1744
00:92:27.520 --> 00:92:29.539
might want or what they might have intended. And

1745
00:92:29.548 --> 00:92:31.470
the recursive part comes from embedding mental states inside other

1746
00:92:31.479 --> 00:92:34.048
mental states. So, for example, um I

1747
00:92:34.060 --> 00:92:39.869
want you to think that I'm smart, but I

1748
00:92:39.878 --> 00:92:42.539
don't want you to think that I want you to

1749
00:92:42.548 --> 00:92:45.390
think that I'm smart because if you thought that you

1750
00:92:45.399 --> 00:92:47.259
would think I was a douche, right? So

1751
00:92:47.270 --> 00:92:49.739
that's an example of recursive mentalis. Their thoughts about

1752
00:92:49.750 --> 00:92:53.338
thoughts, you know, beliefs about desires, beliefs

1753
00:92:53.350 --> 00:92:56.949
about desires, about thoughts, uh beliefs about intentions

1754
00:92:56.958 --> 00:93:00.298
, about thoughts, et cetera. That's a lot

1755
00:93:00.310 --> 00:93:02.970
apologies. Let me get back to social paradoxes.

1756
00:93:02.979 --> 00:93:05.039
Why, why, why does virtue signaling have to

1757
00:93:05.048 --> 00:93:10.689
occur covertly? Well, because being an overt virtue

1758
00:93:10.699 --> 00:93:13.250
signaler trying to show off your virtue, that's a

1759
00:93:13.259 --> 00:93:15.548
signal. But it is also at the same time

1760
00:93:15.560 --> 00:93:18.909
become a cue of one's underlying vanity and self absorption

1761
00:93:19.310 --> 00:93:21.789
and selfishness and pettiness. And perhaps even one's low

1762
00:93:21.798 --> 00:93:25.588
status, maybe you're insecure uh about yourself because you're

1763
00:93:25.600 --> 00:93:27.600
low status and you want to try to show off

1764
00:93:27.609 --> 00:93:30.270
uh to improve your status, whatever, whatever the

1765
00:93:30.279 --> 00:93:30.939
reason, you know, there we draw all sorts

1766
00:93:30.949 --> 00:93:34.479
of nega negative inferences about people when they overtly uh

1767
00:93:34.489 --> 00:93:39.470
and conspicuously show off their virtue. So that means

1768
00:93:39.720 --> 00:93:42.390
that if we want to gain virtue, we cannot

1769
00:93:42.399 --> 00:93:44.819
let people know that we're virtue signaling. We have

1770
00:93:44.829 --> 00:93:46.119
to somehow signal our virtue without making it seem like

1771
00:93:46.128 --> 00:93:50.529
we're signaling our virtue. Um And one way of

1772
00:93:50.539 --> 00:93:53.640
doing that is to hide the fact that we're virtue

1773
00:93:53.649 --> 00:93:55.979
, virtue signaling, not merely from the people we're

1774
00:93:55.989 --> 00:93:58.439
signaling to, but also from ourselves. That is

1775
00:93:58.449 --> 00:94:00.359
we deceive ourselves. We think we're not actually virtue

1776
00:94:00.369 --> 00:94:02.619
signaling, we're, we're pursuing some high minded value

1777
00:94:03.159 --> 00:94:04.668
. Um And, and, and the same story

1778
00:94:04.680 --> 00:94:06.088
could be told about status. If you're a status

1779
00:94:06.100 --> 00:94:10.140
seeker, people draw negative inferences about you, you're

1780
00:94:10.149 --> 00:94:12.270
selfish, you're competitive, maybe you're low status and

1781
00:94:12.279 --> 00:94:15.850
insecure. We don't like status seekers. Uh So

1782
00:94:15.859 --> 00:94:16.810
in order to achieve status, we must conceal the

1783
00:94:16.819 --> 00:94:19.479
fact that we're trying to achieve status that is status

1784
00:94:19.489 --> 00:94:24.779
seeking must occur covertly and must be disguised uh in

1785
00:94:24.789 --> 00:94:29.619
high minded uh uh benevolent terms. Uh uh I

1786
00:94:29.628 --> 00:94:31.208
mean, and this will be my last question.

1787
00:94:31.220 --> 00:94:33.838
I was just about to ask you if this would

1788
00:94:33.850 --> 00:94:38.310
connect in any way to self deception in the sense

1789
00:94:38.319 --> 00:94:43.259
that if we self deceive, then it would be

1790
00:94:43.270 --> 00:94:47.619
easier for us to uh behave in a way that

1791
00:94:47.628 --> 00:94:53.399
would also lead to uh let's say higher probability of

1792
00:94:53.409 --> 00:94:59.189
uh faking our true motives to other people. I

1793
00:94:59.199 --> 00:95:01.918
mean, for other people to not really read what

1794
00:95:01.930 --> 00:95:05.180
we're trying to do there. Right. Yeah.

1795
00:95:05.189 --> 00:95:09.119
So there's a whole literature on the evolution of self

1796
00:95:09.128 --> 00:95:12.079
deception and, and then that um it makes us

1797
00:95:12.088 --> 00:95:15.319
more successful at deceiving others if we can deceive ourselves

1798
00:95:15.329 --> 00:95:18.350
first. And I think the general argument here is

1799
00:95:18.359 --> 00:95:23.489
sound. Um, and I think one way I'd

1800
00:95:23.500 --> 00:95:25.600
like to, I like to frame it is in

1801
00:95:25.609 --> 00:95:30.048
terms of a lawyer who practices their opening statement to

1802
00:95:30.060 --> 00:95:32.159
themselves before they deliver it to the jury. Right

1803
00:95:32.539 --> 00:95:34.020
. Maybe they'll practice in front of the mirror.

1804
00:95:34.029 --> 00:95:35.909
I don't know. Um, but they want to

1805
00:95:35.918 --> 00:95:38.850
make sure that they'll, they'll hear themselves giving the

1806
00:95:38.859 --> 00:95:41.048
arguments and if it's convincing to themselves and if it

1807
00:95:41.060 --> 00:95:42.958
sounds good to themselves, then it probably sounds good

1808
00:95:42.970 --> 00:95:44.729
to, to other people. And I think we

1809
00:95:44.739 --> 00:95:45.720
do that with ourselves. That is we, we

1810
00:95:45.729 --> 00:95:49.750
, we first try out arguments on ourselves before we

1811
00:95:49.759 --> 00:95:53.918
try them out on others. And what we're often

1812
00:95:53.930 --> 00:95:56.838
arguing about is how good we are or how not

1813
00:95:56.850 --> 00:95:58.878
bad we are. So we, we, we

1814
00:95:58.890 --> 00:96:00.229
first try to convince ourselves that we're good people that

1815
00:96:00.239 --> 00:96:02.899
we don't care about status. Uh And we rehearse

1816
00:96:02.909 --> 00:96:04.159
those arguments in our head. And we, and

1817
00:96:04.168 --> 00:96:06.449
we sometimes even even do things in the world that

1818
00:96:06.458 --> 00:96:10.239
help us gather evidence for that picture of ourselves.

1819
00:96:10.250 --> 00:96:12.869
We might actually donate to charity. So that later

1820
00:96:12.878 --> 00:96:14.069
on we can say, hey, I'm not a

1821
00:96:14.079 --> 00:96:15.359
bad person. I actually donate to charity, right

1822
00:96:15.770 --> 00:96:18.119
? So we convince ourselves through talking to ourselves in

1823
00:96:18.128 --> 00:96:20.000
our head and making arguments to ourselves in our head

1824
00:96:20.009 --> 00:96:24.159
and anticipating future scenarios where we might be called out

1825
00:96:24.409 --> 00:96:26.520
. And we also occasionally act in the world.

1826
00:96:26.529 --> 00:96:29.329
So as to accumulate evidence of our good character that

1827
00:96:29.338 --> 00:96:30.899
we can, um, use later on. Uh

1828
00:96:30.989 --> 00:96:34.458
, if we're ever challenged, that is we prepare

1829
00:96:34.729 --> 00:96:36.739
, uh, like lawyers for, for trials that

1830
00:96:36.750 --> 00:96:39.810
we may not ever be in, but it's good

1831
00:96:39.819 --> 00:96:42.180
to prepare in any case because those trials could be

1832
00:96:42.189 --> 00:96:44.699
hugely important, um, for our fitness. Uh

1833
00:96:44.789 --> 00:96:45.298
, that is if we're caught off guard by an

1834
00:96:45.310 --> 00:96:48.329
accusation or an insult, uh, and we have

1835
00:96:48.338 --> 00:96:50.529
no argument to give in response that's going to be

1836
00:96:50.539 --> 00:96:53.338
very bad for our fitness. We want to prepare

1837
00:96:53.350 --> 00:96:55.220
for those types of situations so that we can defend

1838
00:96:55.229 --> 00:96:57.069
ourselves and defend our character. And I think a

1839
00:96:57.079 --> 00:96:59.000
lot of our behavior is oriented around that. So

1840
00:96:59.009 --> 00:97:01.199
, yeah, that's how I construe self deception.

1841
00:97:01.470 --> 00:97:04.039
Um, it's not literally lying to ourselves. It's

1842
00:97:04.048 --> 00:97:06.779
more like bullshitting ourselves. Uh I would, I

1843
00:97:06.789 --> 00:97:09.189
would think of it more as, as, uh

1844
00:97:09.199 --> 00:97:11.899
, self bullshitting. We bullshit ourselves, uh in

1845
00:97:11.909 --> 00:97:15.579
order to more effectively bullshit others. Ok, great

1846
00:97:15.588 --> 00:97:19.199
. So let's end on that very cynical note,

1847
00:97:19.208 --> 00:97:20.779
I guess. But I, I, I'm also

1848
00:97:20.789 --> 00:97:26.659
a very big diogenes fan, so there's no problem

1849
00:97:26.668 --> 00:97:30.979
with that. So David, uh, just before

1850
00:97:30.989 --> 00:97:32.918
we go, would you like to tell people where

1851
00:97:32.930 --> 00:97:36.409
they can find you on the internet? Sure.

1852
00:97:36.418 --> 00:97:40.250
Uh, you can find me on Twitter slash X

1853
00:97:40.609 --> 00:97:42.189
. Um, at David pins off. Um,

1854
00:97:42.199 --> 00:97:44.759
feel free to DM me if you'd like, I'm

1855
00:97:44.770 --> 00:97:46.069
always happy to talk to people. Uh, and

1856
00:97:46.079 --> 00:97:48.039
, uh, you can find my substack, uh

1857
00:97:48.069 --> 00:97:50.569
, uh it's called Everything is bullshit and it's just

1858
00:97:50.579 --> 00:97:56.829
everything is bullshit.substack.com. Great. So I'm leaving links

1859
00:97:56.838 --> 00:97:59.128
to that in the description box of the interview.

1860
00:97:59.140 --> 00:98:00.770
And look, thank you so much again for taking

1861
00:98:00.779 --> 00:98:02.470
the time to come on the show. It's been

1862
00:98:02.479 --> 00:98:05.270
really fun to talk to you. Yep. It's

1863
00:98:05.279 --> 00:98:06.729
been a pleasure. Thanks so much, Ricardo.

1864
00:98:08.600 --> 00:98:10.649
Oh, before we go, would you like to

1865
00:98:10.659 --> 00:98:13.279
