00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.710
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.679
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops. And today

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.739
I'm joined by Doctor David. David Pins off. He's

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.369
a research scientist at UCL, a, the University of

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.909
California, Los Angeles. And his research focuses on evolutionary

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.959
psychology, political psychology, public opinion and sexual behavior. And

7
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:27.530
today we're focusing mostly on political belief systems, the

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.319
meaning of life, morality and some other related topics.

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.250
So David, welcome to the show. It's a big

10
00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:35.330
pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.740
The pleasure is all mine, Ricardo, I'm a big

12
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.479
fan of the podcast and I'm very happy to

13
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.020
be on it.

14
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.680
Great. Thanks. So, starting with the fun stuff, let's

15
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:50.759
talk about political belief systems then. So, I mean,

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.340
I guess that uh if you talk with political

17
00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:59.720
scientists and philosophers, uh when it comes to explaining

18
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.059
how political belief systems work, where they come from,

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.550
they would give you a, I don't know, a

20
00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:12.940
highly intellectualized version of it based on abstract values

21
00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:16.160
and how they are so coherent and so on.

22
00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:19.940
But since you come from an evolutionary psychology perspective,

23
00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:22.940
how do you approach it? Exactly.

24
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.919
Yeah. So um I have a kind of cheeky

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.339
blog called Everything Is Bullshit. Uh And part of

26
00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.750
the shtick there is to call bullshit on things.

27
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.239
And um you could describe my academic paper, uh

28
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.879
strange bedfellows, the alliance theory of, of political belief

29
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.959
systems as a way of calling bullshit on that

30
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.230
prevailing view of political ideology. So, um I really

31
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.730
take aim at the idea that uh liberalism or

32
00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:53.470
conservatism as they manifest in contemporary American society or

33
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.940
other Western nations uh represent uh coherent belief systems,

34
00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:03.510
reflect moral principles, reflect well thought out philosophies. Um

35
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.589
I think they are much more strategic uh chaotic

36
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.240
random uh than, than that. Um And I'd be

37
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.380
happy to get into the details of, of uh

38
00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.839
how I'm grounding out that view.

39
00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.009
OK. So, uh but just before we get into

40
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.250
your view and start exploring it, what would you

41
00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.669
say are some of the most common explanations that

42
00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.199
people bring to the table when trying to explain

43
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.389
where political belief systems come from?

44
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.169
Yeah. So I'd say broadly speaking, the most common

45
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.690
approach to political belief systems is to point to

46
00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.809
some essential difference between people on either side of

47
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.669
the political spectrum. Um So maybe that essential difference

48
00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.889
has to do with one's personality or one's psychological

49
00:02:53.899 --> 00:03:01.089
dispositions. Uh ONE'S uh traits, one's um uh personal

50
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.009
idiosyncrasies and quirks the way one sees the world.

51
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.699
Um And that's one common way of, of looking

52
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.369
at it. Um The other way of looking at

53
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.830
it uh is to say that they, they really

54
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.330
pertain to differences in moral values. So, one of

55
00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.960
the most prominent approaches in this area is Jonathan

56
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.000
Heights Moral Foundations theory, which says that liberals and

57
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.559
conservatives uh rely on different moral foundations that is

58
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.410
uh have a monomaniac egalitarian and harm focused uh

59
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.220
ideology. Whereas conservatives uh rely on all six moral

60
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:41.710
foundations from uh in group out group psychology to

61
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.119
uh to uh purity and authority. Um And roughly,

62
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.440
I think a lot of people in political psychology

63
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.449
would agree that there are deep seated moral differences

64
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.399
between liberals and conservatives. Republicans and Democrats, left wing,

65
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.570
left wing, right wing uh et cetera. Uh And

66
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.500
uh and, and it's those abstract moral values that

67
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.779
color and explain uh the contents of our political

68
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.020
belief systems. They are the common thread that ties

69
00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.779
all our beliefs together. Uh And I think that

70
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:15.880
is mistaken

71
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.928
and what would you say are some of the

72
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.170
biggest weaknesses, at least in your view when it

73
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:27.170
comes to hypotheses that are based on or try

74
00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.350
to explain political belief systems on the basis of

75
00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:33.859
abstract values. Because I mean, it seems to me

76
00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:37.609
that sometimes people are trying to talk about abstract

77
00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:42.079
values and not necessarily just moral values, but some

78
00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:46.670
other sorts of political values uh as if they

79
00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:51.619
were like sort of separate from the rest of

80
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.820
our psychology and based on just pure rational philosophy

81
00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:01.660
or something like that. So, what are your thoughts

82
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.100
on that.

83
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.510
Sure. Yeah. Um I think the biggest problem with

84
00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.209
that view is that it's just fundamentally evolutionarily implausible.

85
00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:11.179
So if you, if you, if you actually look

86
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.059
at what people who believe in these abstract values

87
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.269
are saying, uh usually what they're saying is that

88
00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.459
these values are not self interested, they're not helping

89
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.200
a person advance their power or status or access

90
00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.709
to resources. They're not in the interests of one's

91
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.130
self or one's kin. Uh But they're also not

92
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.459
group interested either. Um Because if they were, then

93
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.690
we would strategically endorse whatever values support our political

94
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.299
allies and reject them or flout them when they

95
00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.760
serve the interests of our political rivals. And when

96
00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:44.309
we have a wide variety of heterogeneous political allies,

97
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.429
as we do uh in uh modern democracies with

98
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.779
complex political coalitions, then we're going to see uh

99
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.119
the strategic endorsement of moral values in one case

100
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.880
to support one's allies and the rejection of that

101
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.820
moral value uh when it happens to support our

102
00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.660
rivals. And so that is basically identical to alliance

103
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.320
theory that these values are not really held consistently,

104
00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:09.000
but are used strategically to support the interests of

105
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.260
one's allies and oppose the interests of one's rivals.

106
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.220
But the problem is if these abstract values are

107
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.809
not in our self interest and they're not in

108
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.579
our political allies, interests or our group's interests, then

109
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.459
that really rules out the only possible mechanisms by

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.529
which these values could have evolved, uh you know,

111
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.049
Darwin once famously said that um um something along

112
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.799
the lines of uh uh things don't exist merely

113
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:37.619
for the sake of beauty or for the sake

114
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.149
of mere variety. Um They don't exist to delight

115
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.589
man or the creator, right? And if, and if

116
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.510
you could show that that uh the properties of

117
00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.480
an animal exhibited these uh benevolent properties, uh then

118
00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:52.839
that would be absolutely fatal to the theory of

119
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.470
evolution. And I think a lot of people in

120
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.350
political psychology are taking that kind of evolutionarily implausible

121
00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:01.989
view that we have these high minded values that

122
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
are nobly designed to make the world a better

123
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.480
place. But that's just not the kind of thing

124
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:08.790
that can evolve by natural selection. And so I

125
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.250
think we actually need to get a bit more

126
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.910
cynical about our uh supposed moral values in the

127
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.630
same way that we're cynical about the mission statements

128
00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:20.290
and N pr campaigns of big corporations. I don't

129
00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:23.850
think anyone thinks that Starbucks is actual goal is

130
00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:27.829
to uh uh nourish and inspire the human spirit,

131
00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.570
as it says on their website. I think most

132
00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.649
people went trying to predict what Starbucks is going

133
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.630
to do next, uh are going to ask themselves

134
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.839
what, what will make Starbucks the most money. And

135
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.359
I think we need to view humans in a

136
00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:42.850
similar way. I think we need to view the

137
00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:46.320
quote unquote mission statements of design to mobilize supporters.

138
00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.720
Uh AND they, uh, we, we really have no

139
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.649
reason to think that they, they represent nobly designed

140
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.630
impartially, altruistic, uh, world views. I think that's fundamentally,

141
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.630
uh evolutionarily and functionally implausible.

142
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.279
And a very interesting question here is if people's

143
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.670
political beliefs are even consistent, there is, and of

144
00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:11.399
course, that might mean different things. But I guess

145
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.279
that what people mean by consistent theory is that,

146
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.869
for example, if someone say, says they are from

147
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.165
the left or from the right, or a Republican,

148
00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:25.825
a democrat or libertarian, an a, an authoritarian or

149
00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:29.635
something like that, that uh there's sort of a,

150
00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:33.815
a checklist and they check all the points when

151
00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:36.905
it comes to the political beliefs that you usually

152
00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:42.729
associate with either side of the political spectrum. But

153
00:08:42.739 --> 00:08:45.989
uh I mean, there, there are, I guess very

154
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.929
good criticisms of that, for example, back in 2018,

155
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.200
I interviewed Robert Kurzban and he has a very

156
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.590
good book about that and the sort of shows

157
00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:01.640
I think to some extent that people are not

158
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.469
really consistent, at least if we look at things

159
00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:11.650
from, uh I mean, expecting that people again, check

160
00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:14.099
all of the boxes when it comes to a

161
00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:18.700
particular political ideology. And there are things that perhaps

162
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.150
even if I, for example, identify as a Republican,

163
00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:25.500
I might agree with some points on some points

164
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:30.890
with the Democrats and vice versa. So are people's

165
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.969
political beliefs really consistent or not?

166
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.429
Yeah. Um So it's, it's a complicated question and

167
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.479
that, I think the way that a lot of

168
00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:45.929
political scientists think about consistency is misguided. Um So

169
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.570
a lot of political scientists will think that, you

170
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.520
know, if you support, um, say, uh you know,

171
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.830
a Christian fundamentalist morality, you know, uh anti aora

172
00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:01.760
uh anti recreational drugs, um, anti gay rights. And

173
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.960
you also endorse free market libertarianism that, that is

174
00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:08.940
a consistent moral philosophy. Uh And if you, in

175
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.849
so far as you deviate from that, then you're

176
00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:13.609
inconsistent. Um And I think that is just a

177
00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:16.590
very wrong headed way of thinking about what it

178
00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:18.770
means to be consistent. I think we should define

179
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.650
consistency in the straightforward way of having beliefs that

180
00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:24.830
fit together coherently. Um And if you actually look

181
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.489
at the combination of Christian fundamentalism and, and free

182
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.690
market libertarianism, there's actually nothing consistent about it at

183
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.950
all. Um The only reason these philosophies go together

184
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.080
in the United States is because of a historically

185
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.799
contingent political alliance that arose in uh starting in

186
00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:43.065
the 19 seventies between wealthy business people and uh

187
00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:46.344
pro-life evangelicals. And that alliance does not exist in

188
00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:49.044
many other countries. In fact, in other countries, you

189
00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:53.784
see free market libertarianism being combined with um with

190
00:10:53.794 --> 00:10:56.864
more, more secular ideology, with, with um with being

191
00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:00.284
pro choice. Um And so this peculiar alliance that

192
00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:02.375
exists in the United States is not a reflection

193
00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:04.815
of some deep, you know, feature of human nature

194
00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:07.145
that, that, that these issues have to go together.

195
00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:10.265
Uh I think they are much more historically contingent

196
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.320
uh and arbitrary than we like to think. Um

197
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.630
And so I don't think that uh political belief

198
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.299
systems are consistent in the sense of reflecting coherent

199
00:11:18.309 --> 00:11:22.739
philosophies or consistently held moral principles. And I go

200
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.409
through a lot of examples in the paper of,

201
00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:27.820
of ideological inconsistencies that are really hard to explain

202
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.299
from that perspective, but easy to explain from my

203
00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:30.979
perspective.

204
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.119
OK. But wait a minute, because at this point,

205
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.669
someone might come in and say, ok, but perhaps

206
00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:42.570
that's true for just the general population. I mean,

207
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:48.210
the average citizen, the average voter is ignorant is

208
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:52.070
ill informed. They don't inform themselves about the politics,

209
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.710
about the political philosophy, the political science, they don't

210
00:11:56.719 --> 00:12:00.710
read blah, blah blah. And so that's the main

211
00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:04.750
reason why they say they are, for example, on

212
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.190
the right, but they have inconsistent beliefs, they might

213
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.950
believe in some things that are mostly associated with

214
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.869
the left and so on and vice versa as

215
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.969
well. But what about the, let's call them political

216
00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:23.289
elites. And that would include, of course, the more

217
00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:28.000
let's say, educated people, the people who actually read

218
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.460
the political philosophy, the political science and they want

219
00:12:32.469 --> 00:12:36.219
to try to be or they say they want

220
00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:39.960
to try to be as consistent as possible. Uh

221
00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:45.460
And they are constantly informing themselves on the politics,

222
00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:50.010
what's happening and so on the political alliances and

223
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.349
all of that. Uh I mean, our political elites,

224
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.070
the more educated people, the more informed people, more

225
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.169
consistent than just the general population.

226
00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:06.859
Yeah. So that's generally the standard view in political

227
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.289
science, which is that the, the masses are, are

228
00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:13.840
generally um uninformed or, or at the very least,

229
00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:16.239
not as, as well informed as their elite counterparts.

230
00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:19.150
Uh And they, they don't, they sort of lack

231
00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:23.489
quote unquote ideological consistency. Uh And the dominant explanation

232
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.849
for, for, um mass opinion is that it's group

233
00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:32.239
centric that is, it's rooted in uh sort of

234
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.030
uh group attachments, group prejudices, group allegiances, you know,

235
00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:39.719
and their policy preferences really depend on, you know,

236
00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:42.844
whether the policy is in groups they like or

237
00:13:42.854 --> 00:13:45.125
groups they don't like. And if it's benefiting a

238
00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:46.965
group, they like, then they like the policy. And

239
00:13:46.974 --> 00:13:48.465
if it's benefiting a group, they don't like, then

240
00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:51.025
they don't like it. And that's really the dominant

241
00:13:51.034 --> 00:13:54.455
approach to explaining uh the uh political beliefs of

242
00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:57.825
the mass public. Uh And what's interesting is that

243
00:13:57.835 --> 00:14:00.585
the group attitudes of the mass public aren't, do,

244
00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:03.255
not necessarily align with the group attitudes of political

245
00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:06.784
elites that is they're much more chaotic and unpredictable.

246
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.729
Um What I want to argue is that the

247
00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:15.510
political beliefs of elites are, in fact, just as

248
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.809
group centric as the political beliefs of the mass

249
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.010
public. It is just that there that the groups

250
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.080
around which they center uh are a different set

251
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:31.320
of groups uh and the uh and the beliefs

252
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.900
might be a more sophisticated set of rationalizations, befitting

253
00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:38.960
of, of more intelligent, highly educated people. Um But

254
00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:41.750
that's really the only difference that is, you see

255
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.369
these complex political coalitions and alliances and the most

256
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.330
politically informed people are most attentive to the details

257
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.119
of those political coalitions and are most willing to

258
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.500
align themselves with those coalitions and accommodate new alliances

259
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.840
and oppose the enemy of their enemy and befriend

260
00:14:57.849 --> 00:15:01.640
the ally of their ally. Uh And that kind

261
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.979
of loyalty and engagement is what ultimately drives their

262
00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:06.770
beliefs, their loyalty to the coalition as a whole,

263
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.409
not any kind of uh abstract philosophizing. Usually the

264
00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:15.900
abstract philosophy comes as a justification or rationalization for

265
00:15:15.909 --> 00:15:18.849
whatever serves the interests of their political coalition.

266
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.260
So we've been focusing mostly on people here but

267
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:29.419
uh talking about the belief systems themselves. And of

268
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.099
course, here again, we are coming from the presupposition

269
00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:40.219
that there is a pure ideological belief system from

270
00:15:40.229 --> 00:15:44.179
any sort of ideology here, which is also something

271
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.070
uh questionable or debatable. But uh are even the

272
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.299
belief systems, them themselves coherent because someone might say,

273
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:56.929
oh OK, so you're saying or earlier, you talked

274
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.239
about the example of some ideological inconsistencies when it

275
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.469
comes to, for example, uh rep Republicans in the

276
00:16:05.479 --> 00:16:09.169
US. But people might say, OK, but that's just

277
00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:14.960
a silly historical accident, but they are still uh

278
00:16:14.969 --> 00:16:21.760
pure uh right wing ideology out there somewhere. And

279
00:16:21.989 --> 00:16:25.219
when you look at it and if you're careful,

280
00:16:25.229 --> 00:16:28.760
you can see that it's really coherent. But is

281
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.969
that really the case?

282
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.340
Yeah. So I think it's not the case and

283
00:16:33.349 --> 00:16:35.840
you could go through any feature you want to

284
00:16:35.849 --> 00:16:38.809
identify with, say right wing ideology or left wing

285
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.659
ideology. Um I go through three different proposed features

286
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:48.070
in, in the paper, um equality, authority and tolerance.

287
00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:50.909
And I go through each feature and show how

288
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:54.239
uh the uh apparent uh moral principle or moral

289
00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:57.710
moral value is actually not held consistently. And it's

290
00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:00.890
only uh brought forward when it's in the interests

291
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.750
of one's political allies and it is flouted and

292
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.069
rejected when it happens to benefit other groups, uh

293
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.489
especially one's political rivals. Um So to take an

294
00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:15.560
example from the equality domain, um liberals think it

295
00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.250
is unfair that corporate CEO S uh make millions

296
00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.689
of dollars a year, but they actually think it's,

297
00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:24.469
uh it's fair for Hollywood movie stars to make

298
00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:26.648
millions of dollars a year. Um And so that

299
00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:28.489
would be an example of the type of ideological

300
00:17:28.698 --> 00:17:31.999
inconsistency I'm talking about, especially when you consider the

301
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.409
fact that corporate CEO S are widely associated with

302
00:17:34.418 --> 00:17:36.999
conservatives and Hollywood movie stars are widely associated with

303
00:17:37.009 --> 00:17:39.298
liberals. And what's interesting is that, uh you actually

304
00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.038
see the reversal among conservatives, conservatives actually think that

305
00:17:42.048 --> 00:17:45.058
it's unfair for Hollywood movie stars to make millions

306
00:17:45.068 --> 00:17:47.208
of dollars a year. And so as soon as

307
00:17:47.218 --> 00:17:51.020
you swap in different groups that people feel allegiance

308
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.189
or rivalry towards. You see their supposed principles shift

309
00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:57.979
and change flexibly. Another example from the equality domain,

310
00:17:57.989 --> 00:18:00.900
we like to think that conservatives don't care about

311
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.699
disadvantaged groups. But when you say, should the government

312
00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:06.400
do more to help small working class towns in

313
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.859
America's Heartland? That is very much a right wing

314
00:18:08.869 --> 00:18:11.810
coded group and a majority of conservatives say yes,

315
00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:13.810
the government should do more to help them. So

316
00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.719
it's really not a matter of being in favor

317
00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:19.130
of quality of equality or inequality in the abstract

318
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.439
or in general, it's really being strategically in favor

319
00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:25.349
of it uh when it favors the interests of

320
00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:28.540
one of one's allies and being strategically against it

321
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.430
when it favors the interests of one's rivals. And

322
00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:33.890
I'm happy to go through some of the other

323
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.390
um supposed principles as well if you'd like me

324
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:37.619
to.

325
00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:39.939
Oh yeah, sure. I mean, I was just about

326
00:18:39.949 --> 00:18:43.890
to ask you because there's this idea that whatever

327
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.500
sort of principles are part of a specific political

328
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:53.760
ideology. I mean, the ideology itself derives from supposed

329
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.869
first principles. That is something that philosophers, for example,

330
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.670
talk a lot about. And in this particular case,

331
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.430
I guess that some political scientists would also argue

332
00:19:04.439 --> 00:19:07.439
that. But I mean, you're making the case here

333
00:19:07.449 --> 00:19:11.790
that that's not really the case they are based

334
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.989
or these ideologies are based on things like have

335
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.719
a justifications, rationalizations, moralization and so on. So perhaps

336
00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:25.270
tell us a little bit more about that. And

337
00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:28.930
if you have a few more examples to illustrate

338
00:19:28.939 --> 00:19:29.750
this point.

339
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.400
Sure. So we can go through the idea of

340
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.229
um uh authoritarianism. Uh Another widely proposed view is

341
00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:40.479
that right wing ideology is all about respecting authority

342
00:19:40.489 --> 00:19:45.489
or obeying authority or um enforcing one's preferences on

343
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.810
others. Uh And that just does not make a

344
00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:50.880
lot of sense at all. Um So if you

345
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.670
ask, you know, conservatives, whether we ought to respect

346
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.260
authority more, most of them would say yes. But

347
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.430
then if you ask them, if, if companies should

348
00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:01.439
disobey government regulations that they think are unfair, a

349
00:20:01.449 --> 00:20:03.630
majority of them will also say yes. So that's

350
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.369
another example of an inconsistency. So conservatives are um

351
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.040
are happy to say they support authority in the

352
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.780
abstract. But when it comes to specific authorities, like,

353
00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.920
I don't know the IRS CDC, the EPA the

354
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:23.959
who um government regulators uh Democratic uh politicians, uh

355
00:20:24.104 --> 00:20:26.935
even the FBI once they started investigating Donald Trump,

356
00:20:26.944 --> 00:20:31.474
uh many uh Republicans turned against. Uh These are

357
00:20:31.484 --> 00:20:35.015
a wide variety of authorities that Republicans reject and

358
00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.535
disrespect. So I, I think it is very hard

359
00:20:37.545 --> 00:20:41.560
to argue that they are holding a case. Um

360
00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:43.839
And if you think that it's about exercising authority

361
00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:46.640
over others, I think that's also hard to reconcile

362
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.630
with their actual opinions which involve uh you know,

363
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:58.010
uh deregulating um uh businesses, um environmental deregulation uh

364
00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.650
uh uh having fewer restrictions during COVID-19. Uh These

365
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.729
are hard to reconcile with a general desire to

366
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:07.839
exercise authority over others. Um And if you look

367
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:09.969
at the desire to exercise authority over others in

368
00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:13.170
terms of restricting their speech, uh you actually see

369
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.420
uh uh little to no differences at all between

370
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.750
liberals and conservatives that is people want to restrict

371
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.869
the speech of their political opponents, uh but not

372
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.760
their political allies. And you see that on both

373
00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:24.989
sides of the political spectrum, if anything, there might

374
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.280
be a little bit of evidence that that is

375
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.920
more prominent on the left these days. So I

376
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.469
think it's hard to argue that that that authority

377
00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:35.089
or a general desire to obey or exercise authority

378
00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:39.619
is the unifying principle of right wing ideology. Um

379
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.829
So the other one is uh tolerance. So that

380
00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:45.959
would be a um a, a kind of tribalism

381
00:21:45.969 --> 00:21:50.010
or nationalism or um ethnocentrism that is supposed to

382
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.589
be uh more prevalent among, among right wing people.

383
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.109
And I think there, that's e equally at odds

384
00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:59.750
with reality. Uh So if you ask conservatives whether

385
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.819
we ought to be more suspicious, uh and distrusting

386
00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:05.130
of foreigners, uh most of them will say yes.

387
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.109
But then when you ask if we should trust

388
00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:10.150
Vladimir Putin, when he said that he did not

389
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.859
interfere in the 2016 election, a majority of them

390
00:22:12.869 --> 00:22:15.400
will also say yes. Uh So there's, that's quite

391
00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.589
a stark inconsistency there that is, they think we

392
00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:19.689
should be distrusting of foreigners. But when it comes

393
00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:23.709
to AAA particular foreigner uh who, who, who is

394
00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:27.239
a Russian autocrat and hostile, overtly hostile to the

395
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.930
United States, they seem to trust him quite readily.

396
00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:31.579
Uh And so I think that is one of

397
00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:34.400
many uh uh stark inconsistencies you see uh uh

398
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.660
uh on, on the right. Uh And I think

399
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.920
it's uh I list a few other examples in

400
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.349
the paper but um you could also see similar

401
00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:44.599
inconsistencies on the left that is the left will,

402
00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:46.969
will say that they value uh you know, uh

403
00:22:46.989 --> 00:22:50.819
diversity and respecting the views of, of a variety

404
00:22:50.829 --> 00:22:53.209
of different groups, but in fact, they disrespect the

405
00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:56.640
views of uh any group that is mildly associated

406
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.790
with conservatives. So Christian fundamentalists pro-life people, uh uh

407
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.650
white people, men, uh uh wealthy business people, uh

408
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.229
these days, even uh pro-israeli people. Um So, uh

409
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:15.089
the respect for diversity is actually, um pretty restricted

410
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:17.310
to a list of groups that are, that are

411
00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:19.800
left coded. Mhm.

412
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.430
Uh And I mean, I'm not sure if this,

413
00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:24.609
what I'm about to say makes sense or not,

414
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:29.520
if it doesn't please correct me in whatever way

415
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:33.260
you think. Uh It makes sense. But, uh I

416
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.160
mean, even when it comes to some of the

417
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:41.670
supposed principles or at least the labels people come

418
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.560
up with sometimes to refer to some of their

419
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.400
values that supposedly orient their political ideology. Uh I

420
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:58.000
mean, sometimes with same label people from different sides

421
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:03.300
mean different things and they're also inconsistent within their

422
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.650
own ideology. But for just to talk about different

423
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.859
sides, meaning different things. For example, when it comes

424
00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:13.969
to economics, perhaps someone on the left when they

425
00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:18.849
use the word freedom or they, they would bring

426
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:21.349
the word freedom to the table when saying, OK,

427
00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:27.209
so uh perhaps workers should be paid enough, should

428
00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:31.229
earn enough to cover at least their basic expenses

429
00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:35.819
and to feel secure enough in their own lives.

430
00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:38.719
I mean, if they work example, full time, they

431
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:42.189
should earn enough to cover their bills and, and

432
00:24:42.199 --> 00:24:45.400
not being ejected from their homes and stuff like

433
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.140
that. And perhaps they might use the word freedom

434
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.219
there in the sense of not being economically coerced,

435
00:24:53.229 --> 00:24:55.819
for example. But when it comes to the right,

436
00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:59.949
perhaps they would use the word freedom to refer

437
00:24:59.959 --> 00:25:02.750
more to things like in the case of more

438
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.910
libertarian right wingers, uh they want a more deregulated

439
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.949
market and that's freedom for them. So I mean

440
00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:14.810
that that's also you're making in the sense that

441
00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:18.500
OK, so people use these words, they refer to

442
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.199
principles, but even then they uh they use it

443
00:25:23.209 --> 00:25:27.630
very sometimes very loosely because in a particular situation,

444
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.140
freedom means one thing, in another situation, it means

445
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.160
another thing. And even the supposed meaning that in

446
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.180
this particular case, freedom might have for the leftists

447
00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:43.880
and right wingers. If you look across different examples,

448
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.719
perhaps they are not. So much on the side

449
00:25:46.729 --> 00:25:50.650
of their own uh flavor of freedom, but they

450
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.869
are more authoritarian and so on. So does this

451
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.140
also make sense?

452
00:25:55.869 --> 00:25:57.119
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.

453
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.689
I think it's a great example of, of the

454
00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:01.339
point I'm making, which is that it, it, it

455
00:26:01.349 --> 00:26:04.119
doesn't really make sense to say that one ideology

456
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.160
is the ideology of freedom, given that each uh

457
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.699
political coalition is trying to use freedom to mobilize

458
00:26:11.709 --> 00:26:15.300
support for its side. That is freedom is uh

459
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.770
a word that has a lot of positive vibes.

460
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:19.959
Uh If you, if you ask people, if they

461
00:26:19.969 --> 00:26:21.859
like freedom, I bet you that most people will

462
00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:24.390
say, yeah, freedom is great. And so each party

463
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.160
is basically competing to capture the positive vibes of

464
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.709
freedom to mobilize support for their side. Uh But

465
00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:33.680
whether each side actually consistently holds the principle of

466
00:26:33.689 --> 00:26:35.599
freedom is a different question. And I think the

467
00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:37.969
answer to that question is no, they don't. Um

468
00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:40.839
WHAT they're trying to do is use freedom as

469
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.839
a kind of mission statement to uh um associate

470
00:26:44.849 --> 00:26:48.229
their political coalition with positive vibes. Um But I

471
00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:52.160
don't think it represents a coherent and principled philosophy

472
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.479
because if it were, you would see each side,

473
00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:57.540
you know, uh valuing freedom in all cases. But

474
00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.260
that is uh but that is not what you

475
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.239
see. Um Another example of this kind of competition

476
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.199
for, for positive and negative vibes I think is

477
00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:08.500
really clear in the abortion debate. Um YOU see,

478
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.989
uh you know, people who oppose abortion, they, they

479
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.280
describe themselves as pro life that is, they're trying

480
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.739
to paint themselves as the group that values life,

481
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.319
right? They're trying to put a positive spin on

482
00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:23.540
their view. Uh And, and in the same way,

483
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.969
uh people on the, on the pro choice side

484
00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.385
uh are trying to claim the mantle of freedom

485
00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:29.925
that a woman should have the right to do

486
00:27:29.935 --> 00:27:33.145
what she wants with her own body. But of

487
00:27:33.155 --> 00:27:36.045
course, neither side holds this actual, this principle actually,

488
00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:39.185
consistently, people who are pro life are happy to

489
00:27:39.194 --> 00:27:41.964
be pro death when it comes to civilian casualties,

490
00:27:42.084 --> 00:27:44.915
when it comes to military occupations, when it comes

491
00:27:44.925 --> 00:27:47.699
to the death penalty, uh when it comes to

492
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:51.589
contraception, which could uh actually prevent abortions, um uh

493
00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:54.689
on the left, uh uh uh most liberals will

494
00:27:54.699 --> 00:27:56.010
say that a woman should have the right to

495
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.030
do what she wants with her own body unless

496
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.010
she wants to um say uh purchase private health

497
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.920
insurance or not wear a seatbelt or drink a

498
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.500
large sugary soda or have sex for money. Uh

499
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.790
These are all views that are pretty common on

500
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.750
the left and they are pretty inconsistent with the

501
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.790
idea that we should generally have the right to

502
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.260
do what we want with our own bodies. Um

503
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.930
So, uh that would be, that would be my,

504
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.010
my case there.

505
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.489
Yeah. And I brought that to the table, I

506
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:30.219
mean, people basically using the same term or referring

507
00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:33.540
to the same principle, but with different meanings because

508
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.050
sometimes in political debates, political discussions, it's very obvious,

509
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.569
at least for someone looking on the outs from

510
00:28:41.579 --> 00:28:45.579
the outside that uh people are using the same

511
00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:49.160
term. But with completely different meanings, like in this

512
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.520
case, freedom and the examples I and you gave

513
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.010
here. So um uh uh but perhaps what I

514
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.119
was alluding to there by bringing that discussion here

515
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:06.050
to the table is that, is it really about

516
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.729
the word or the principle of freedom or since

517
00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:15.589
you're uh using it to refer to completely different

518
00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:19.150
things? Isn't it really about you having a particular

519
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.609
kind of interest of you wanting to do some

520
00:29:22.699 --> 00:29:25.780
something or wanting other people to do something as

521
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.800
well uh or not do for uh in particular

522
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:35.910
cases and then simply attaching the label freedom to

523
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:40.199
it just because it sounds good to try to

524
00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:42.280
convince other people, for example.

525
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.589
Yeah, I think it's very much the latter and

526
00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:47.079
I think it's, it's directly analogous to the marketing

527
00:29:47.089 --> 00:29:49.890
and pr you see in the corporate world, you

528
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.739
know, corporations will have mission statements, they have values

529
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.650
that they are supposedly pursuing. Uh And, and because

530
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.800
it is in their financial interest to associate positive

531
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.430
vibes with their brand, right? You know, Starbucks says

532
00:30:04.439 --> 00:30:06.239
their mission is to inspire and nurture the human

533
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.050
spirit. Um I'm sure you could come up with,

534
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.540
with, uh, uh equally silly examples from, from other,

535
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.339
uh, large corporations. Um, AND I think there is

536
00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:20.180
an interesting element there, which is that in order

537
00:30:20.189 --> 00:30:22.430
to sell, in order to make money, you have

538
00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:24.260
to convince people that you're not interested in making

539
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.099
money. Uh, AND I think that's what I would

540
00:30:27.109 --> 00:30:28.880
call a social. But I think you, you see

541
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.680
the exact same phenomenon in the political world in

542
00:30:30.689 --> 00:30:33.510
order to gain uh power, you have to convince

543
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.660
people that you're not interested in gaining power, that

544
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.500
instead what you're interested in is making the world

545
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.099
a better place. Generally making things better for everyone

546
00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:42.939
being uh kind and generous and fair and, and

547
00:30:42.969 --> 00:30:45.939
patriotic and virtuous and all those sunny things. But

548
00:30:45.949 --> 00:30:50.099
really, uh um politics is a competition to gain

549
00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:53.119
control of the coercive apparatus of the state which

550
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.920
uh literally forces people to do things by threat

551
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.819
of imprisonment. Uh And uh that is a scary

552
00:30:58.829 --> 00:31:01.359
thing and nobody has ever gained power by saying

553
00:31:01.369 --> 00:31:03.619
that that's what they want. You know, I, I

554
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.880
want to gain control of the, the coercive apparatus

555
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.619
of the state so that I can boss people

556
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.140
around and force them to do things by threat

557
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.310
of imprisonment. No one has ever gotten elected by

558
00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:14.339
saying that just as no business has ever made

559
00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:16.160
money by saying all I want to do is

560
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.699
make as much money as possible. I don't care

561
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:20.890
about values or the environment or, or whatever. Um

562
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.819
So I think we have these, these um social

563
00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:25.930
paradoxes, these tensions in our mind that in order

564
00:31:25.939 --> 00:31:28.359
to pursue, pursue our goals, we cannot admit the

565
00:31:28.369 --> 00:31:30.520
goals we're pursuing. Uh And I think we can't

566
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.069
even admit them to ourselves. A lot of the

567
00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:33.599
time. I think a lot of people at Starbucks

568
00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:35.540
would probably believe their own bullshit that they really

569
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.910
are trying to inspire and nurture the human spirit.

570
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.880
And I think uh most committed partisans and ideologues

571
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.849
also believe their own bullshit that they really are

572
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:47.390
trying to uh pursue this impartially altruistic vision to

573
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.270
uh uh better humanity in the world.

574
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.349
Uh But when it comes to the social dynamics

575
00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:59.890
uh themselves. So for example, things like social identity

576
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.189
and intergroup relations, what aspects of that kind of

577
00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:07.494
research would apply here because I mean, I I

578
00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:11.194
read in your paper that you are also trying

579
00:32:11.204 --> 00:32:15.444
to reframe, for example, the in group out group

580
00:32:15.454 --> 00:32:23.255
dichotomy as an allies versus rivals, dichotomy, right? Could,

581
00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:24.334
could you explain that?

582
00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:28.949
Sure. So there's a whole bunch of research on

583
00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:31.640
what's called social identity theory, the idea that we

584
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.449
have an in group and we have an out

585
00:32:33.459 --> 00:32:36.290
group and it's a monolithic in group and against

586
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.750
a monolithic out group and they, they stay, they're

587
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.099
fixed and they stay the same and we we,

588
00:32:41.109 --> 00:32:43.229
you know, do things and believe things to make

589
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:45.680
us feel better about our in group to enhance

590
00:32:45.689 --> 00:32:49.119
our self esteem. And uh we, we do things

591
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.270
that make the out group look worse to enhance

592
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.400
our self esteem. That is, that is the uh

593
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.310
vision coming out of decades of research in social

594
00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:58.760
psychology. I think that vision is, is deeply flawed

595
00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.209
for a number of reasons. Uh uh FOR one

596
00:33:01.219 --> 00:33:03.949
thing, um If you actually look at the uh

597
00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:08.069
group dynamics and um uh small scale hunter gatherer

598
00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:11.676
for societies, uh It is nothing like the monolithic

599
00:33:11.686 --> 00:33:14.505
in group against the monolithic out group. It is

600
00:33:14.515 --> 00:33:18.985
very much uh complex strategic Aries occurring within groups.

601
00:33:19.245 --> 00:33:23.475
Uh They're constantly fission and fusion. Uh They're called

602
00:33:23.485 --> 00:33:26.336
fission fusion societies, literally like they, they have small

603
00:33:26.345 --> 00:33:28.956
bands of around 20 or 30 people and then

604
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:31.161
they, they form larger groups and then they split

605
00:33:31.171 --> 00:33:34.121
apart. And so it's much more complicated and dynamic

606
00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:36.421
than the picture of a, of one tribe on

607
00:33:36.432 --> 00:33:38.121
one side of the river and another tribe on

608
00:33:38.131 --> 00:33:39.852
the other side of the river. I think we

609
00:33:39.862 --> 00:33:43.942
are much more politically savvy and sophisticated than this

610
00:33:43.952 --> 00:33:46.631
kind of caveman tribalism that is that has come

611
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:50.281
out of uh social identity theory. Um And so

612
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:52.421
what I try to replace this, this picture with

613
00:33:52.949 --> 00:33:54.520
is instead of talking about in groups and out

614
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.449
groups, which is misleading in, in, in a variety

615
00:33:56.459 --> 00:33:58.609
of ways. I think it's, it's more illuminating to

616
00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:02.430
talk about alliances, to talk about allies and rivals.

617
00:34:02.439 --> 00:34:05.880
Uh AND uh and conflicts within groups uh So,

618
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.609
uh I can walk you through some of the,

619
00:34:07.619 --> 00:34:09.399
the ways in which this in group out group

620
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.239
thing breaks down. So, uh you know, uh you

621
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.052
might expect uh that uh uh in order to

622
00:34:16.062 --> 00:34:18.042
favor a group, you would have to be in

623
00:34:18.052 --> 00:34:19.833
that group, they would have to be in your,

624
00:34:19.842 --> 00:34:21.833
in group. And in order to um oppose a

625
00:34:21.842 --> 00:34:23.732
group, they would have to be uh your out

626
00:34:23.742 --> 00:34:25.902
group. But that's just manifestly not the case. Uh

627
00:34:25.913 --> 00:34:29.422
You don't have to be a black person to

628
00:34:29.433 --> 00:34:32.092
feel as if you are an ally of black

629
00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:33.996
people and you don't have to be a police

630
00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.016
officer to feel as if you are an ally

631
00:34:36.025 --> 00:34:37.815
of police officers. You don't have to be an

632
00:34:37.824 --> 00:34:39.916
Israeli to feel pro Israel. You don't have to

633
00:34:39.926 --> 00:34:42.114
be a Palestinian to be pro Palestinian. You do

634
00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:43.726
not have to be in a group to be

635
00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:46.426
an ally of that group. Alliances can occur between

636
00:34:46.436 --> 00:34:49.436
groups and the same thing occurs within groups. You

637
00:34:49.446 --> 00:34:52.996
don't have to, you, you can be a white

638
00:34:53.005 --> 00:34:56.708
person and uh feel enmity toward white people. In

639
00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.060
fact, a lot of white progressives uh feel that

640
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.699
way about white people. Um You can be an

641
00:35:01.709 --> 00:35:04.709
American and feel negatively toward Americans. Did a lot

642
00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:07.550
of progressives hold that view uh as well. Uh

643
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.629
You can be a poor person and feel antipathy

644
00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:12.600
toward poor people. You can be a rich person,

645
00:35:12.709 --> 00:35:15.429
feel antipathy toward rich people. And these phenomena are

646
00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:17.530
much easier to understand when you realize that there

647
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.199
are rivalries within groups that is within the group

648
00:35:21.209 --> 00:35:23.879
of rich people. There are different subcultures uh within

649
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:26.399
the group of poor people. There are different subcultures,

650
00:35:26.409 --> 00:35:28.959
perhaps ethnic rivalries between lower class white people and

651
00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:33.979
lower class ethnic minorities, um uh et cetera, et

652
00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:36.169
cetera. So I think um if we, if we

653
00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:39.639
view politics from the lens of ever shifting alliances

654
00:35:39.649 --> 00:35:41.989
and rivalries, uh I think that is going to

655
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
be much more illuminating and insightful way of understanding

656
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.959
things than in terms of cheering for some monolithic

657
00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:50.040
in group against some monolithic out group that never

658
00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:50.610
changes.

659
00:35:52.169 --> 00:35:55.810
And when it comes to the alliances, how do

660
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.760
people form them? I mean, are there uh is

661
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.919
there a set of criteria that people use to

662
00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:03.850
choose their allies?

663
00:36:04.979 --> 00:36:07.550
Yeah. So in the paper, I go over three

664
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.620
criteria that people use for choosing allies that have

665
00:36:10.629 --> 00:36:12.899
a lot of uh empirical evidence going for them

666
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:14.300
at the moment. I'm not saying that these are

667
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.780
the only three criteria we use, but I think

668
00:36:16.939 --> 00:36:19.030
uh the strongest case could be made that that

669
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.409
these are important. So the three are uh similarity,

670
00:36:22.419 --> 00:36:25.020
transitivity and interdependence. So I'll go through each one

671
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.550
in turn, uh similarity uh like attracts like we

672
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.070
like people who are similar to us. Uh PEOPLE

673
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.719
who speak the same language who uh speak that

674
00:36:33.729 --> 00:36:36.939
language in the same dialect who inhabit the same

675
00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:43.590
location uh who um share uh personality quirks, maybe

676
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.379
share similar beliefs, um uh share the same skin

677
00:36:48.389 --> 00:36:50.770
color, et cetera, et cetera. This is a pretty

678
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.040
obvious one. And the, and the evolutionary rationale there

679
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.209
is pretty clear. Um So for one thing, uh

680
00:36:57.219 --> 00:37:00.800
similarity uh might help you coordinate and collaborate with

681
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:04.050
an ally. That is uh the, the easiest example

682
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.020
of this is if allies speak the same language,

683
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.500
they're gonna have an easier time working together. But

684
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.280
um they could also speak the same language of

685
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.500
their subculture and have an easier time working together

686
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.409
or they could have, you know, similar personality quirks

687
00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:18.020
and they might, you know, uh uh be less

688
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.679
likely to have conflicts and disagreements with one another

689
00:37:20.689 --> 00:37:22.919
because of, because they're more similar in, in that

690
00:37:22.929 --> 00:37:27.780
vein. Um A marker might help to uh create

691
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.780
common knowledge of the alliance itself that as you

692
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.760
see this in sports, you know, one team wears

693
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.810
one wears a red shirts, the other team wears

694
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.770
blue shirts and that helps everyone coordinate, uh who's

695
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.899
on whose side. Uh We do the same thing

696
00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:43.090
with uh with our alliances and rivalries. And I

697
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.629
think one of the reasons why racism is so

698
00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:47.939
pernicious is because there are visible uh differences that

699
00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:50.669
are common knowledge to everyone uh in terms of

700
00:37:50.679 --> 00:37:53.649
skin color and outward appearance. Um And that helps

701
00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:55.810
uh make it easier for people to coordinate uh

702
00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.310
who's on whose side the second one is transitivity.

703
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:03.280
Uh So that is summed up by the following

704
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.879
statements, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

705
00:38:06.149 --> 00:38:08.090
Uh The friend of my friend is my friend,

706
00:38:08.389 --> 00:38:11.270
the friend of my enemy is my enemy and

707
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.010
the enemy of my friend is my enemy. Uh

708
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.939
These statements taken together are what I call transitivity,

709
00:38:17.949 --> 00:38:21.020
the sharing of allies and enemies. And there are

710
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.969
pretty solid functional reasons why we would want transitive

711
00:38:23.979 --> 00:38:27.540
allies versus intransitive allies. That as it mitigates two

712
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.370
major costs, one is infighting that is we don't

713
00:38:30.379 --> 00:38:33.449
want our allies getting into conflicts with one another

714
00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:35.169
because if they get into conflicts, then we're going

715
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.199
to have to be forced to choose sides. We

716
00:38:37.209 --> 00:38:39.189
have to be forced to choose between them. And

717
00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:40.270
that means we're going to lose one of our

718
00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.739
allies and potentially gain a new enemy, which is

719
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.570
really bad for us. So we want our allies

720
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.949
to get along. Uh But, and we also want

721
00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:50.209
our allies to share our enemies because um if,

722
00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:53.620
if an ally uh is friendly toward our enemies,

723
00:38:53.629 --> 00:38:55.729
well, they might, they might side with our enemies

724
00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:58.439
and betray us. Uh And that is really bad

725
00:38:58.449 --> 00:39:01.169
for us as well. So for that reason, we

726
00:39:01.179 --> 00:39:05.020
really uh we look to, to transitivity when, when

727
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.290
deciding who we want to ally with and who

728
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.100
we don't. Uh AND we also uh try to

729
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.030
accommodate new allies by um by being transitive with

730
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.060
them that is if, if we form an alliance,

731
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:21.280
we oppose our allies, enemies. Uh AND we support

732
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:26.669
our allies, friends, that's transitivity, uh inter interdependence. This

733
00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:29.020
is probably the broadest and most unexplored one. But

734
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.010
I think um it's, it's, it's perhaps one of

735
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.590
the most important ones. This is just generally whether

736
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.729
uh a person or individual benefits you or not,

737
00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:38.639
whether they are acting in your self interest or

738
00:39:38.649 --> 00:39:42.070
not. Um You could think of this uh in

739
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.040
terms of someone acting against your self interest, say

740
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.030
if you're competing with someone for status or resources,

741
00:39:47.229 --> 00:39:49.870
um then you would be negatively interdependent with them

742
00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:51.110
and you would not want to form an alliance

743
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.300
with them because it is in your interests to

744
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.800
lower their status or to lower their access to

745
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.760
resources. So you can get more of those resources

746
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.320
for yourself. So it would be a kind of

747
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.449
negative interdependence, a positive interdependence would be these people

748
00:40:02.459 --> 00:40:04.739
are inclined to help you to share information with

749
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.540
you, to trade with you, um et cetera, et

750
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.090
cetera. Um So interdependence are just, you know, a,

751
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.709
a cooper relationship wherein uh uh parties benefit each

752
00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:17.610
other either directly or indirectly that is likely to

753
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.840
lead to alliances. So those are the three criteria

754
00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.889
I discussed in the paper.

755
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.300
And of course, when we have alliances, we need,

756
00:40:25.449 --> 00:40:27.699
I mean to maintain them, of course, we need

757
00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:31.250
to support our allies. And so in, in the

758
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.300
particular context of politics, or at least that's one

759
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.770
of the contexts where you see this happening, how

760
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.780
do we do that through the use of pro

761
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.959
propagandistic uh tactics?

762
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.330
So the point of an alliance, from my perspective

763
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.969
is to uh uh offer support in conflicts that

764
00:40:51.979 --> 00:40:54.350
is conflicts is ubiquitous in social life. There are

765
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.620
limited resources like status, power and resources and one

766
00:40:57.629 --> 00:41:00.659
side's or, or one person's gain is is another

767
00:41:00.669 --> 00:41:05.629
side or person's loss. So uh in order to

768
00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:08.860
prevail in these conflicts, we try to uh mobilize

769
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.820
supporters, we try to draw people to our side

770
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.169
so that our side is bigger than the other

771
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:15.370
side and the other side submits to our bigger

772
00:41:15.379 --> 00:41:17.909
side. That's the way democracy works the side with

773
00:41:17.919 --> 00:41:20.169
the most votes wins. That's how a lot of

774
00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:23.389
conflicts uh play out in small scale societies, the

775
00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:26.159
bigger side gets their way. Um And so we

776
00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:28.389
have a, a vested interest in making our side

777
00:41:28.399 --> 00:41:30.870
the bigger side. How do we do that? Uh

778
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:34.360
The way we do that is with propaganda. Um

779
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.469
So when a conflict breaks out, we try to

780
00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:39.929
frame the conflict and describe it in ways that

781
00:41:39.939 --> 00:41:45.679
uh um flatter our allies and impugn our rivals.

782
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.320
Um So I can walk you through the three

783
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.659
propagandistic biases I discussed in the paper if you'd

784
00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:55.550
like. Yeah, sure. So the first one is uh

785
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.219
perpetrator biases. So uh probably the most common source

786
00:41:59.229 --> 00:42:01.949
of conflict would be someone committing harm against someone

787
00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:06.669
else. Um And uh how do you uh mobilize

788
00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:10.120
support for a perpetrator of a transgression against the

789
00:42:10.129 --> 00:42:12.510
person? They rocked. Well, one way you want to

790
00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.510
do that is you want to downplay that transgression.

791
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.550
You want to minimize it, you want to justify

792
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.889
it, you want to rationalize it. You want to

793
00:42:17.899 --> 00:42:22.709
emphasize the mitigating circumstances, you want to emphasize their

794
00:42:22.719 --> 00:42:25.229
good intentions, they didn't really mean to do anything

795
00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:29.030
wrong. Um You want to uh frame them as

796
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.280
generally a good well meaning person and the the

797
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.120
victim as as being AAA crybaby or even making

798
00:42:34.129 --> 00:42:36.030
it up altogether. So that's what I would call

799
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.169
perpetrator biases. Um They are extremely common uh both

800
00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:42.909
when we commit transgressions and when our allies commit

801
00:42:42.919 --> 00:42:46.350
transgressions, we uh bring perpetrator biases to bear on

802
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.620
that. The other side of this, of course, is

803
00:42:48.629 --> 00:42:51.370
victim biases. Victims have basically the opposite set of

804
00:42:51.379 --> 00:42:55.520
biases. So they uh will view the perpetrator as

805
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.219
uh uh incredibly personally responsible for, for committing the

806
00:42:59.229 --> 00:43:02.159
harm, no mitigating circumstances, no good intentions. They were

807
00:43:02.169 --> 00:43:04.989
just pure evil twirling their mustaches and, and they

808
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.820
just wanted to harm us just out of pure

809
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:10.320
sadism. Uh And uh of, of course, the harm

810
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.199
they committed was incredibly grievous. It will last for

811
00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:15.550
generations. We can, we should never forget it. We

812
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.310
should always remember this horrible harm that has, that

813
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.199
will, that will last forever. Um Those, those are

814
00:43:22.209 --> 00:43:25.520
um victim biases. Um You could think of it

815
00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.530
as the exact opposite of perpetrator biases. Um And

816
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.879
then there's another class of interesting biases that relate

817
00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:34.770
to conflicts over status and resources. Uh This presumably

818
00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.800
would also be a recurrent source of conflict in

819
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.659
ancestral environments. And the way we resolve these conflicts

820
00:43:39.669 --> 00:43:42.750
is by making attributions about the causes of disadvantages

821
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.979
and advantages. Um That is uh if we attribute

822
00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:49.399
a person's advantages to their internal dispositions, that is

823
00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:52.540
their intelligence, their talent, uh their wisdom, their, their,

824
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:57.060
their creativity, um their work ethic, then uh we're

825
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.889
inclined to side with that person and let them

826
00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:01.679
have their advantages or their resources. Um But if

827
00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:04.600
a person uh uh lost a lot of resources

828
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.209
or status through no fault of their own, through

829
00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:10.760
misfortune through bad luck, um or through uh mistreatment

830
00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.389
or exploitation by others. Uh Then we're inclined to

831
00:44:13.399 --> 00:44:16.580
side with them and we're inclined to um uh

832
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.110
give resources to them and, and compensate them and

833
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.939
help them in, in whatever way we can. Um

834
00:44:21.949 --> 00:44:24.260
So naturally, if there's a conflict over resources or

835
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.340
status, then we're going to uh want to attribute

836
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.659
our high status allies uh advantages to their internal

837
00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:33.449
dispositions, they're smart and, and hard working and our

838
00:44:33.459 --> 00:44:37.020
low status allies, disadvantages to external factors. They were

839
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.550
just unlucky or they were preyed upon by exploitative

840
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.270
people. Uh And so we, we have both of

841
00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.110
these biases and we employ them depending on whether

842
00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.090
our allies are in the advantaged position or the

843
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.330
disadvantaged position. And we do that in a strategic

844
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.090
way, those are attribution biases.

845
00:44:54.649 --> 00:44:58.219
And so how do we go from the biases

846
00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:02.300
you've just described there? And also uh what we

847
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.590
talked about a bit earlier regarding social dynamics and

848
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.489
alliances. How do we go from there to political

849
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.570
alliance structures, like for example, let's say a political

850
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.149
party.

851
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.070
Yeah. So um it just kind of falls naturally

852
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.419
out of those, those basic assumptions about how our

853
00:45:22.629 --> 00:45:25.139
psychology works. So if you just think about, you

854
00:45:25.149 --> 00:45:27.800
know, similarity, transitivity, interdependence and just look at the,

855
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.600
the kind of social groups that form in any

856
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.750
given society, you can start to see how this

857
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.850
might unfold. So for example, you might get some

858
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.909
uh some groups forming based on ethnicity uh or

859
00:45:37.919 --> 00:45:40.439
uh region, you know, southerners might have a kind

860
00:45:40.449 --> 00:45:44.600
of Southern loyalty or class uh or uh or

861
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.100
religion. Um And from there, you, you start to

862
00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.639
think about, well, how are these groups going to

863
00:45:49.649 --> 00:45:51.719
coalesce into different alliances? And then you might start

864
00:45:51.729 --> 00:45:54.879
thinking about transitivity and then you might start thinking

865
00:45:54.889 --> 00:45:57.540
about overlap between groups. So maybe, you know, ethnic

866
00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.560
minorities are going to overlap with poor people. And

867
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.229
so you might get an alliance between the interests

868
00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:05.149
of ethnic minorities and the interests of lower class

869
00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:09.280
people. Um And you might see uh some, some

870
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.760
status rivalries between, you know, members of the upper

871
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.149
class. That is the more highly educated uh elites

872
00:46:15.159 --> 00:46:19.820
and the less educated, wealthy corporate executives. And you

873
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.149
might see a rivalry there with perhaps uh intellectual

874
00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:27.489
elites siding with um ethnic minorities and poor people

875
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.669
and with the wealthy business people siding with uh

876
00:46:30.679 --> 00:46:32.979
lower class white people who might feel rival risk

877
00:46:32.989 --> 00:46:38.149
with their lower class, ethnic minority counterparts. Uh And

878
00:46:38.159 --> 00:46:40.560
uh that's, that's basically the, the dynamics of how

879
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.350
it plays out. Um And then from there, once

880
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.459
you, you get this alliance structure, um it, you

881
00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:49.659
just straightforwardly apply those propagandistic biases to each member

882
00:46:49.669 --> 00:46:51.530
of the alliance structure. And then from there, do

883
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.280
the contents of political belief systems just fall out

884
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.040
uh perfectly. Uh And you, and you can get

885
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:59.729
a beautiful explanation for all of the inconsistencies and

886
00:46:59.739 --> 00:47:02.979
double standards and idiosyncrasies of political belief system simply

887
00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:05.250
by looking at the alliance structure and looking at

888
00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.199
what beliefs would mobilize support for each member of

889
00:47:08.209 --> 00:47:12.449
that alliance structure and from their ideologies uh fall

890
00:47:12.459 --> 00:47:14.340
out of that elegantly.

891
00:47:15.229 --> 00:47:18.530
But since from the very beginning of our conversation,

892
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.760
we've also been referring to alternative theories. Uh In

893
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:28.010
this case, in the paper, you also go through,

894
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.784
for example, intolerance theory of authoritarianism theory and egalitarianism

895
00:47:33.794 --> 00:47:36.955
theory. So could you tell us about those? I

896
00:47:36.965 --> 00:47:41.895
mean, how uh in what ways they would be

897
00:47:41.905 --> 00:47:46.405
alternatives to your alliance theory of political belief systems?

898
00:47:46.415 --> 00:47:50.245
And I in what aspects do you think they

899
00:47:50.254 --> 00:47:50.885
failed?

900
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.899
Sure. Um So one alternative explanation for the existing

901
00:47:55.909 --> 00:47:57.729
alliance structure that is, is that it's all based

902
00:47:57.739 --> 00:48:00.449
on equality. And really what you see in the

903
00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:02.510
left wing alliance is just a bunch of low

904
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.699
status disadvantaged groups. And what you see in the

905
00:48:04.709 --> 00:48:06.040
right wing alliance is just a bunch of high

906
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.469
status disadvantaged groups. But if you actually look at

907
00:48:09.479 --> 00:48:11.290
the alliance structure, you see that that is not

908
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.110
the case. So there are plenty of high status

909
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.320
groups uh on the left wing side, like college

910
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:22.239
professors, scientists, uh government regulators, um members of the

911
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:28.610
uh of, of international organizations, um scientists, et cetera.

912
00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.030
Uh And then you also see plenty of low

913
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.939
status groups on the right wing side. So you

914
00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:36.340
see, uh you know, working class white people, um

915
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.739
you know, uh manufacturing workers, um people without a

916
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.189
college degree, people in uh uh small towns that

917
00:48:44.199 --> 00:48:49.489
are struggling. Um And uh what's interesting is that

918
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.939
if you actually measure groups, perceived status and you

919
00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:57.040
measure their perceived political allegiances, turns out that status

920
00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.070
makes no difference uh in in predicting which group,

921
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.919
either side of the political spectrum will like will

922
00:49:01.929 --> 00:49:04.639
like or dislike. So this, I'm referring here to

923
00:49:04.649 --> 00:49:07.489
the work of mark brand. Uh And he measured

924
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.949
attitudes toward a variety of different groups, dozens of,

925
00:49:09.959 --> 00:49:12.399
of different social groups in society measured their status,

926
00:49:12.409 --> 00:49:16.389
measured their perceived political allegiances. Turns out the simplest

927
00:49:16.399 --> 00:49:18.899
and most elegant and powerful model just uses the

928
00:49:18.909 --> 00:49:22.389
group's perceived political allegiances, throws out status throws out

929
00:49:22.399 --> 00:49:25.689
other variables that basically predicts who you're going to

930
00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:29.149
like, uh, and, and dislike. Um, AND, and, and

931
00:49:29.159 --> 00:49:31.159
if you just think about other groups, you know,

932
00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:32.790
like there are plenty of groups in the political

933
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.360
line structure that don't really seem high status or

934
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:38.510
low status at all. Like our environmentalists, high status.

935
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.290
I, I don't know, uh, are, are Christian fundamentalist,

936
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.389
high status or low status? I don't know. Uh

937
00:49:43.399 --> 00:49:45.889
WHAT about Southerners, high status or low status? Not

938
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:53.169
sure. Um PRO-LIFE people, unclear, recreational drug users, unclear.

939
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.050
Uh Really, I think status is either ambiguous or

940
00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.770
it violates the rules. So I don't think that

941
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.659
equality can really explain uh contemporary alliance structures and

942
00:50:02.669 --> 00:50:04.979
it certainly can't explain uh the variation in allied

943
00:50:04.989 --> 00:50:07.280
structures you see around the world and throughout history.

944
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.780
So the alliance structures were very different in the

945
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.840
past. Uh uh uh African Americans used to be

946
00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:14.729
quite loyal to the party of Lincoln uh racist,

947
00:50:14.739 --> 00:50:16.780
segregationist Southerners used to be quite loyal to the

948
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.344
Democrats Party. They were known as Dixiecrats. Uh uh

949
00:50:19.354 --> 00:50:23.415
uh uh DEVOUT Christianity used to, to not be

950
00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:26.364
a partisan issue at all. Uh So if you,

951
00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:27.935
if you look at these line structures, there's so

952
00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:29.925
much variation across time and space that it's really

953
00:50:29.935 --> 00:50:32.364
hard to argue that any principle of equality uh

954
00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:34.875
is organizing them. And then of course, there are

955
00:50:34.885 --> 00:50:38.385
plenty of ideological inconsistencies regarding equality which I discuss

956
00:50:38.395 --> 00:50:39.814
in the paper and which I, I talked about

957
00:50:39.824 --> 00:50:45.929
previously. Um THE other ones, authority and diversity. Um

958
00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:48.570
Yeah, I basically use the same strategy with those.

959
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.870
I, I go through uh plenty of ideological uh

960
00:50:50.879 --> 00:50:56.010
inconsistencies where these principles are not uh held. Uh

961
00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:01.080
AND, and are often flouted uh strategically. Um And

962
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:04.810
yeah, that's, that's basically my, my beef with uh

963
00:51:04.969 --> 00:51:08.010
egalitarianism, authoritarianism and tolerance.

964
00:51:08.719 --> 00:51:11.919
So, since you're from the US, do you think

965
00:51:11.929 --> 00:51:16.169
that if your theory is correct, it might help

966
00:51:16.179 --> 00:51:21.610
us understand or better understand the formation of the

967
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.560
Democratic Republican divide? Whether,

968
00:51:27.199 --> 00:51:29.850
yeah, so I, I presented a pretty detailed sketch

969
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.780
of, of how I think this divide originated. Uh

970
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:36.889
And uh where, where it was, you know, around

971
00:51:36.919 --> 00:51:40.300
100 150 years ago and how it has evolved

972
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.419
over time. So, as I mentioned, uh previously, uh

973
00:51:43.429 --> 00:51:45.949
the current political instructor is very different than what

974
00:51:45.959 --> 00:51:48.750
it was. Um YOU know, 100 150 years ago

975
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.790
at the turn of the 20th century. Um Yeah,

976
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.219
you know, uh Christianity and, and, and abortion was

977
00:51:55.229 --> 00:51:56.649
just not an issue. It was not a divide.

978
00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:58.979
Feminism was, was not a divide between the two

979
00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:02.459
parties. Um uh AT the turn of the 20th

980
00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:05.820
century, um race was very different. So, uh African

981
00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.000
Americans were actually leaned in favor of the Republican

982
00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:13.310
Party, uh uh racist southerners were, were Democrats. Um

983
00:52:13.419 --> 00:52:17.469
So, uh I walk through the evolution of that

984
00:52:17.479 --> 00:52:20.629
alliance structure and how it has changed in the

985
00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:23.139
paper. Uh And I think uh you could tell

986
00:52:23.149 --> 00:52:25.770
a similar story for how alliance structures have played

987
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.739
out in other societies. I think you see some

988
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:31.060
overlaps in, in similar countries like uh countries in

989
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:33.540
Western Europe. Uh And I think that could be

990
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.429
explained by just uh convergences and the types of,

991
00:52:36.439 --> 00:52:39.129
of factors that create alliance structures. So if you

992
00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:44.310
have, you know, overlap between um highly religious pos,

993
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:46.280
you know, whatever the cause of that overlap, if

994
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:47.989
there's overlap, then groups are gonna be more likely

995
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.629
to form an alliance and, and belong to the

996
00:52:49.639 --> 00:52:52.389
same political coalition than other groups. And I think

997
00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:54.080
you see that convergence in a lot of Western

998
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:57.659
European nations, particularly nations who have, who have um

999
00:52:57.669 --> 00:53:02.129
had similar uh political conflicts um about globalization and

1000
00:53:02.139 --> 00:53:06.879
the erosion of religious morality. Um And it also

1001
00:53:06.889 --> 00:53:08.239
explains some of the differences. I think if you

1002
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.699
look at the unique history of different uh countries,

1003
00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:13.459
particularly Eastern European countries who, who uh who are

1004
00:53:13.469 --> 00:53:16.370
dealing with the collapse of communism uh that has

1005
00:53:16.379 --> 00:53:18.760
resulted in different alliances. You even there's an interesting

1006
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.659
example, I cite in the paper in Latvia where

1007
00:53:21.669 --> 00:53:25.500
uh um uh green parties were actually sort of

1008
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:29.790
uh anti-communist, right wing nationalist uh parties uh because

1009
00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.120
they were, they rose in opposition to Soviet industrial

1010
00:53:32.129 --> 00:53:34.580
policy. Um So there are lots of, there are

1011
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.100
lots of interesting examples of alliance structures that, that

1012
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.570
deviate from what you see, in America and a

1013
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.290
few uh western nations. Um And I talk about

1014
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.189
that a lot in the paper and how other

1015
00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:46.840
theories really struggle to explain it.

1016
00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.179
Uh And so, uh I would also like to

1017
00:53:50.189 --> 00:53:53.449
ask you about, uh I would, I would like

1018
00:53:53.459 --> 00:53:58.120
to hear your thoughts about uh moral foundations theory.

1019
00:53:58.129 --> 00:54:01.669
That's also something that we touched on earlier a

1020
00:54:01.679 --> 00:54:05.719
little bit. So, um what are your thoughts on

1021
00:54:05.729 --> 00:54:10.239
it? And on basically the idea bit uh about

1022
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.479
there being a connection or an intimate connection between

1023
00:54:14.709 --> 00:54:19.989
uh certain moral values and also certain correspond or

1024
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.889
supposedly corresponding political ideologies. And uh a second question

1025
00:54:25.899 --> 00:54:29.610
I have that's related to that is uh do

1026
00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:36.409
you think that um the way you're thinking about

1027
00:54:36.419 --> 00:54:40.129
or reframing the way we think about political belief

1028
00:54:40.139 --> 00:54:44.189
system, uh ethical systems or not?

1029
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.229
Yeah. Um So, uh first, I'll just start off

1030
00:54:49.239 --> 00:54:51.209
by saying that I'm, I'm very skeptical of, of

1031
00:54:51.219 --> 00:54:55.689
moral foundations theory as a theory of political differences.

1032
00:54:55.699 --> 00:54:58.389
So I don't think it can explain why liberals

1033
00:54:58.399 --> 00:55:01.300
and conservatives have the beliefs. They do. I don't

1034
00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.100
think it can even come close to explaining all

1035
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.729
of the inconsistencies in political ideologies. In fact, it

1036
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:08.459
struggles to make sense of them. Um As I

1037
00:55:08.469 --> 00:55:11.090
argue in the paper. So I think in terms

1038
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.000
of a theory of political belief systems, moral foundations

1039
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:18.439
theory fails um as a theory of moral cognition,

1040
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.989
uh I think it's fine as a first pass,

1041
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.300
I think there, you know, the, the six foundations

1042
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.439
that he sketched are reasonable hypotheses about um cognitive

1043
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:31.199
adaptations that might have evolved to solve recurrent problems

1044
00:55:31.209 --> 00:55:34.350
and cooper operation and, and group living. Um I

1045
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.760
personally prefer uh Oliver Curry's work which sort of

1046
00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:41.469
expands upon uh Jonathan he's work uh and adds

1047
00:55:41.479 --> 00:55:44.070
a few additional uh foundations and gets a little

1048
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.949
bit more systematic about the, the game theory uh

1049
00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:51.129
uh uh of, of these adaptive problems. Um So

1050
00:55:51.139 --> 00:55:52.679
as a theory of morality, I, I have no

1051
00:55:52.689 --> 00:55:56.830
objections to moral foundations theory. Um So the question

1052
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.639
was whether um this sort of cynical view of

1053
00:55:59.649 --> 00:56:04.120
political ideologies applies to moral systems as well. Um

1054
00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:09.520
And maybe, maybe not. Um So in the paper,

1055
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.889
I sort of take great pains to distinguish between

1056
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.820
politics and morality because I think they're too often

1057
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.540
conflated uh in a way that causes a lot

1058
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:20.229
of confusion. And the reason they're conflated is because

1059
00:56:20.239 --> 00:56:24.699
politics uh almost always masquerades as morality in order

1060
00:56:24.709 --> 00:56:28.149
to, in order to achieve its political objectives, that

1061
00:56:28.159 --> 00:56:30.280
is in order to rally people to our side,

1062
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:32.120
we have to convince people that our side is

1063
00:56:32.129 --> 00:56:34.639
the good side, the moral side, the virtuous side,

1064
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:38.659
and the other side is evil, unfair, uh disrespectful,

1065
00:56:38.669 --> 00:56:42.709
et cetera. So morality is our chief weapon in

1066
00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:44.760
our political arsenal. And that is why it is

1067
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.560
often so easy to confuse morality with politics as

1068
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:50.100
if they were the same thing that is to

1069
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:55.919
confuse moralism with, with morality. Um And uh in

1070
00:56:55.929 --> 00:56:59.110
the paper, I, I try to differentiate politics and

1071
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.760
morality in the following way. I describe politics as

1072
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:08.330
being centrally about conflict and loyalty to one or

1073
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.270
the other side of that conflict. That's what I

1074
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:15.070
think politics is ultimately about uh uh and morality

1075
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.260
is ultimately about cooper operation that is working together

1076
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:21.760
for a mutual benefit uh and impartiality to uh

1077
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:23.770
either side of a conflict and working to resolve

1078
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.500
conflicts. So, uh in that sense, when once you

1079
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.760
cleave uh politics from morality, morality starts to look

1080
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:33.610
pretty nice. Um So in that sense, I don't

1081
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.540
think that um uh morality as distinguished from, from

1082
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:40.520
politics, uh it can be described in the same

1083
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.489
sort of cynical terms as being about, you know,

1084
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.770
self interested. Um uh FLOUTING of moral principles. I

1085
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.000
think we do have genuine moral principles that are

1086
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.929
shared between liberals and conservatives. I think the prevailing

1087
00:57:51.939 --> 00:57:55.000
view that ideologies are about moral disagreement is actually

1088
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.070
backwards. I think um at the heart of our

1089
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.449
political disputes is, is moral agreement that is we

1090
00:58:01.459 --> 00:58:03.550
are using the same moral moral language, the same

1091
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.679
moral intuitions to try to win political conflicts. Uh

1092
00:58:06.689 --> 00:58:08.810
We're trying to cast our side as the fair

1093
00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.840
side, as the side for freedom, the side for

1094
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:16.239
patriotism. Um THE side for compassion. Uh And, and

1095
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:19.159
we couldn't have those political fights if both sides

1096
00:58:19.169 --> 00:58:23.239
didn't care about compassion, uh freedom, fairness, et cetera.

1097
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.199
So I think we have common moral intuitions that

1098
00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:28.709
partisans compete to activate and that underlies a lot

1099
00:58:28.719 --> 00:58:30.040
of our political discourse.

1100
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:35.389
And so again, if your theory is correct, um

1101
00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.469
would it have some implications as to how we

1102
00:58:39.479 --> 00:58:45.870
look at uh correlations between individual differences and political

1103
00:58:45.879 --> 00:58:50.649
beliefs? Like, for example, a certain differences in personality

1104
00:58:50.659 --> 00:58:54.179
traits and particular political beliefs.

1105
00:58:55.189 --> 00:58:57.830
Sure. Yeah. So a lot of people think that

1106
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.639
personality traits are the explanation for our political belief

1107
00:59:00.649 --> 00:59:03.149
systems. I think that's wrong, but that doesn't mean

1108
00:59:03.159 --> 00:59:05.620
that they don't matter and they don't exist clearly.

1109
00:59:05.629 --> 00:59:07.939
There is some evidence that there are some personality

1110
00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:10.489
differences between liberals and conservatives. There are some psychological

1111
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.500
differences between liberal conservatives. The question is, what role

1112
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:16.580
do they play? Uh, IN my view, uh, they

1113
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:20.500
play a secondary role to alliances. Um, AND, uh,

1114
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:23.860
there are two ways that, that, that personality. Uh,

1115
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:28.439
SO, uh, the first way is that, um, your

1116
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:34.449
psychological traits might predispose you to join certain alliances

1117
00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:37.570
over others that is, you might be inclined to

1118
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.919
side with people who are like you or who

1119
00:59:40.929 --> 00:59:43.229
act in the interests of people who are like

1120
00:59:43.239 --> 00:59:48.090
you. Um, SO that's, that's one possible mechanism. So,

1121
00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.409
for example, um, if I am sexually restricted, uh,

1122
00:59:52.419 --> 00:59:55.669
and, uh, uptight about sexual promiscuity, I might be

1123
00:59:55.679 --> 00:59:58.959
more inclined to become religious. Um, AND if I'm

1124
00:59:58.969 --> 01:00:00.879
more sexually promiscuous, I might be more, I might

1125
01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:02.760
be less inclined to become religious. I might abandon

1126
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:07.719
my, my religious upbringing. Um And uh and of

1127
01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.389
course, so, so there will be a causal pathway

1128
01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:12.959
between your sexual strategy, your religiosity and your ideology.

1129
01:00:12.979 --> 01:00:16.280
But ultimately, the religiosity is what's um predicting the,

1130
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.879
the ideology, not the, the uh sexual strategy directly.

1131
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.260
Uh II, I think, uh or, or, or, you

1132
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.979
know, the sexual strategy, predicting loyalty to fellow uh

1133
01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.540
sexually restricted people and, and wanting to advance their

1134
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:32.699
group interests. So that's one way, the other way

1135
01:00:32.709 --> 01:00:35.429
is that the group you belong to or ally

1136
01:00:35.439 --> 01:00:38.899
with, uh shapes your personality or your psychological traits.

1137
01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:40.120
There are plenty of ways you can see that

1138
01:00:40.129 --> 01:00:41.860
if you belong to a religious community, they're going

1139
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.800
to pressure you to behave in ways that are

1140
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:48.399
that um uh that mark you as a member

1141
01:00:48.409 --> 01:00:50.510
of that religious community and distinguish you from other

1142
01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.699
communities, they're gonna want you to uh uh profess

1143
01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:57.149
your devotion to the religions, creeds to um to

1144
01:00:57.159 --> 01:00:59.949
purge all doubts and uncertainties from your mind uh

1145
01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:03.449
to become more sexually restricted if you. Uh So

1146
01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.429
it might work the other way as well. Um

1147
01:01:05.439 --> 01:01:07.689
So there are really two possible ways. So your,

1148
01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:10.810
your personality might uh cause you to join certain

1149
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.689
alliances over others or your, your alliance might shape

1150
01:01:14.699 --> 01:01:17.989
your personality. Uh And I think both of those

1151
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.969
uh uh mechanisms are compatible with alliance theory and

1152
01:01:20.979 --> 01:01:23.330
compatible with the idea that alliances are ultimately the

1153
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.729
direct primary cause of our political beliefs.

1154
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.139
Uh And so your paper is all about, uh

1155
01:01:31.149 --> 01:01:35.439
sort of new approach in political psychology, what you

1156
01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:39.340
call there a shift from deep seated moral values

1157
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:44.250
to ever shifting alliances and rivalries. So before we

1158
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.959
move on from this topic to another one, I

1159
01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:49.989
would like to ask you. So do you think

1160
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.620
that I if you're correct? And if basically we

1161
01:01:54.629 --> 01:01:58.979
told people about this, that when people get frustrated

1162
01:01:58.989 --> 01:02:02.320
because for example, from someone from their own political

1163
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:06.120
group, political party, for example, they find out that

1164
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.820
they have uh also um alliances to some extent

1165
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:18.219
with people from other political ideologies and they get

1166
01:02:18.229 --> 01:02:22.500
very frustrated because, and they call them, for example,

1167
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:26.709
hypocrites or traitors or turn cloaks or something like

1168
01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:30.100
that. Do you think that it could help people

1169
01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:34.909
perhaps be a little bit more understanding of where

1170
01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:38.080
that behavior comes from? And perhaps also the fact

1171
01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:43.419
that they probably also do that themselves and I

1172
01:02:43.429 --> 01:02:48.719
mean, perhaps be a little less divisive in their

1173
01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:52.709
political approaches or is that too optimistic?

1174
01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:57.760
Um I, I'm torn on that. II, I definitely

1175
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:59.879
think knowledge is a good thing and, and, and

1176
01:02:59.889 --> 01:03:03.419
knowledge of the truth might help us solve our

1177
01:03:03.429 --> 01:03:07.320
problems and in particular our political problems. Um YOU

1178
01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:10.229
know, sometimes studying this makes me depressed and, and

1179
01:03:10.239 --> 01:03:13.669
cynical and pessimistic. Uh Sometimes I see a bit

1180
01:03:13.679 --> 01:03:16.159
of a silver lining. I think one silver lining,

1181
01:03:16.169 --> 01:03:19.179
you might see is that, uh, this shows us

1182
01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:20.800
that we're really not as different as we think

1183
01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:23.629
we are that we don't have these deep seated,

1184
01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:26.870
uh, world views that are, that are, that are

1185
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.419
completely clashing and at odds with one another, we

1186
01:03:29.429 --> 01:03:32.520
don't have fundamentally different moral principles. We basically have

1187
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.899
the same moral principles. We all care about fairness.

1188
01:03:35.909 --> 01:03:38.209
Um, WE all care about, you know, uh, helping

1189
01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:40.250
people who are truly in need. Uh We all

1190
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.120
care about, you know, welcoming people into our group

1191
01:03:42.129 --> 01:03:44.229
when they pose no threat and when they're willing

1192
01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:46.159
to uh be an, you know, an asset to

1193
01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:48.739
our group, um and the differences really come from

1194
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:51.360
our beliefs about those things about, you know, what,

1195
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:55.040
what is unfair, what is fair, uh Whether the

1196
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:57.639
people we want to welcome really are a threat

1197
01:03:57.649 --> 01:04:01.159
or, or not. Um WHETHER uh the people we

1198
01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:03.639
want to help really are in need. Those are

1199
01:04:03.649 --> 01:04:06.300
really what, what political differences are about. They're not

1200
01:04:07.185 --> 01:04:10.334
uh an absence or a presence of compassion or

1201
01:04:10.344 --> 01:04:13.625
an absence or presence of uh uh you know,

1202
01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:16.014
a willingness to, to welcome people to the group

1203
01:04:16.024 --> 01:04:18.975
or, or um an absence or presence of uh

1204
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:22.385
concerns for fairness. Um So I think uh at

1205
01:04:22.395 --> 01:04:24.245
the heart of our political disputes is, is a

1206
01:04:24.254 --> 01:04:28.260
shared moral psychology. Uh And I think that should

1207
01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:31.649
challenge the idea that one side is inherently morally

1208
01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.800
superior to the other side, at least in terms

1209
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.159
of their underlying character, maybe their beliefs make them

1210
01:04:37.169 --> 01:04:39.129
do things in the world that are bad but

1211
01:04:39.139 --> 01:04:42.040
in terms of their underlying character, their moral psychology,

1212
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.409
their intuitions, the way they interact with their family

1213
01:04:44.419 --> 01:04:47.419
and their friends. Uh, MOST people are pretty decent

1214
01:04:47.429 --> 01:04:50.429
people. Uh, AND, yeah, sometimes they can have beliefs

1215
01:04:50.439 --> 01:04:53.300
that, that make them do terrible things but I

1216
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.830
think it's worth remembering that, that, um, we're not

1217
01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.550
as different as, as we think we are.

1218
01:04:58.419 --> 01:05:01.360
Yeah. I, I was also perhaps thinking about the

1219
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:06.639
fact that, uh, if people understand that, uh, people's

1220
01:05:06.649 --> 01:05:11.179
political beliefs and their own political beliefs are not

1221
01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:16.500
so as coherent or consistent as they think, uh,

1222
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:21.739
that perhaps when they, for example, see someone that,

1223
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:25.530
uh, identifies with their own political poll, political party

1224
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:31.239
or something like that, uh, espousing, uh, political beliefs

1225
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:35.469
that they don't necessarily agree with. That's not really

1226
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:38.199
the end of the world or a tragedy. It's

1227
01:05:38.209 --> 01:05:44.850
just that, uh, I mean, no one is fully

1228
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.030
consistent and no one follows, uh, I don't know

1229
01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.610
the, a particular kind of political dogma to, uh,

1230
01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:58.429
uh, to the last detail. So I don't know

1231
01:05:58.489 --> 01:05:58.570
if,

1232
01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:00.250
yeah. No, that's, that's, that's a good point. Yeah.

1233
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.250
No, that, that makes sense. So, I, I guess

1234
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.239
the idea is that you might be less, uh,

1235
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.850
pissed off by your, by the traitors on your

1236
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:12.949
side. Um, ONCE you realize that your side is

1237
01:06:12.959 --> 01:06:17.000
just a cobbled together patchwork of inconsistent beliefs. If,

1238
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:19.280
if you think that your side has a coherent

1239
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.659
principled moral philosophy and you see someone deviating from

1240
01:06:22.669 --> 01:06:24.399
that, well, then you might think that they're evil

1241
01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:26.600
or insane or stupid. Right. But if you see

1242
01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:28.750
your side as not having a coherent or principled

1243
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.270
philosophy, then you might be a little bit softer

1244
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.840
on people who might deviate from it because if

1245
01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:36.149
they're deviating from it, maybe they're deviating from it

1246
01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.750
in a good way. Um Yeah, that's one hopeful

1247
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.350
way of looking at it. Uh I'm not optimistic

1248
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.000
about political extremists being softened by these ideas, but

1249
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:48.520
I think it might affect uh people who are

1250
01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:50.689
a bit more moderate uh at the margins

1251
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.020
and so changing topics. Now, uh in your substack,

1252
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:01.070
you also, you have a collection of very interesting

1253
01:07:01.199 --> 01:07:05.000
uh articles there and one of them has to

1254
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:09.500
do with the meaning of life. So, does it

1255
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:13.139
really matter? I mean, does it matter if life

1256
01:07:13.149 --> 01:07:17.899
has some meaning or not? At least to most

1257
01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:18.689
people?

1258
01:07:19.929 --> 01:07:23.110
Yeah, it's an interesting question. Uh I think it's

1259
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.870
worth distinguishing between two different kinds of meaning. Um

1260
01:07:26.889 --> 01:07:29.149
So the meaning I'm, I'm talking about in, in

1261
01:07:29.159 --> 01:07:32.429
the post is very much a highfalutin intellectual kind

1262
01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:35.010
of, of meaning. Um TRYING to come up with

1263
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.989
a philosophy of, of, of life that is coherent.

1264
01:07:38.399 --> 01:07:40.540
Um And uh but, but there's a different kind

1265
01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.830
of meaning um that you might call emotional meaning.

1266
01:07:44.149 --> 01:07:46.929
Um THE feeling that what you're doing uh is

1267
01:07:46.939 --> 01:07:50.050
meaningful. And I think that is very much not

1268
01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.310
and has an emotional sense of meaning. And even

1269
01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.629
just raising a family is a, is a meaningful

1270
01:07:54.639 --> 01:07:56.709
activity. Anyone who has a family will, will tell

1271
01:07:56.719 --> 01:08:00.010
you that, you know, trying to raise their kid

1272
01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.520
and have a good relationship with their kid is

1273
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:05.165
a, is a meaningful project to undertake. And uh

1274
01:08:05.175 --> 01:08:09.114
how, how I think about the, the emotional aspect

1275
01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.774
of meaning is basically, it's evolution's way of telling

1276
01:08:11.784 --> 01:08:14.445
you that this activity is in your long term

1277
01:08:14.455 --> 01:08:16.805
fitness interests. It might not pay off right now.

1278
01:08:16.814 --> 01:08:18.615
It might not pay off immediately. It may not

1279
01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:21.015
pay off at all, but probabilistically and in the

1280
01:08:21.024 --> 01:08:24.345
long run, it's good to invest in this activity.

1281
01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:27.169
So, you know, uh if you think about uh

1282
01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.819
your biological fitness, it's very straightforward in the case

1283
01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.870
of raising a family. Um, IT takes a really

1284
01:08:31.879 --> 01:08:34.919
long time to rear a child to maturity and

1285
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.839
to make sure that they're successful and well off

1286
01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.500
and high status and gonna give you lots of

1287
01:08:38.509 --> 01:08:41.759
grandkids. Um, THAT'S a, that's a very difficult and

1288
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:43.990
long run project that will, that will have lots

1289
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.240
of setbacks and obstacles and discomforts and pains and

1290
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.160
conflicts, right? Uh Any, any parent will tell you

1291
01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:51.720
that their, that their kid can be a pain

1292
01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:53.000
in the ass and, and, and you know, it's

1293
01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:55.979
not all sunshine and rainbows. So we need some

1294
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:58.589
kind of emotional mechanism to help us weather those

1295
01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.290
storms. Uh AND, and see the grand prize on

1296
01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:04.689
the horizon, which is, you know, uh uh rearing

1297
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:08.200
a, a mature and successful uh uh family that

1298
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:10.938
will give you lots of grandkids. So that, so

1299
01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:12.969
the emotional sense of meaning is something that evolution

1300
01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:15.288
has given us to get us to devote to

1301
01:09:15.298 --> 01:09:18.298
a long term fitness, beneficial projects. So raising a

1302
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:19.738
family is the most obvious example. But there are

1303
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:22.148
other examples, I think committing to a group, an

1304
01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:25.587
alliance and bolstering that alliance, uh making sure you

1305
01:09:25.599 --> 01:09:27.948
know that, that, that everyone is committed to the

1306
01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:32.779
alliance and purging dissenters and purging uh uh traitors

1307
01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:34.649
from the alliance and making sure that they gain

1308
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.180
power and superiority and dominance over rival alliances. That

1309
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:40.819
is also a long term project that is often

1310
01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.200
beset with many setbacks and obstacles. And I think

1311
01:09:43.209 --> 01:09:45.129
many people gain a lot of meaning from their,

1312
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.470
from their political uh uh allegiances. Um And that

1313
01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.720
can be uh either a good thing or a

1314
01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.299
bad thing depending on how you, you want to

1315
01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:56.080
look at it. Um Cultivating a valuable skill is

1316
01:09:56.089 --> 01:09:58.479
also a long term thing uh that, that will

1317
01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:00.859
pay off in terms of raising your status. But,

1318
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:04.669
but maybe beset with, with obstacles, helping others, you

1319
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.660
know, putting others in your debt that might pay

1320
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:07.879
off in the long run. If you're ever in

1321
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.399
need, then you'll have a lot of people who

1322
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.220
feel grateful for you and are willing to help

1323
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:13.680
you uh in that situation. Uh But in order

1324
01:10:13.689 --> 01:10:16.129
to be helped in that situation, you, you must

1325
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.779
have provided a lot of help to, to others

1326
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.089
before that. And so that's why helping others uh

1327
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.910
feels meaningful. So that's emotional meaning. Sorry, I went

1328
01:10:24.919 --> 01:10:26.089
on a very long tangent there.

1329
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:27.220
That's

1330
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:31.310
um yeah. Uh So I didn't talk about this

1331
01:10:31.319 --> 01:10:33.100
in the piece. I probably should have. Maybe this

1332
01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:35.350
is a separate piece that's emotional meaning. I don't

1333
01:10:35.359 --> 01:10:36.779
think that is unique to intellectuals. I think we

1334
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.930
all have emotional meaning. I think that's a biological

1335
01:10:39.939 --> 01:10:44.350
adaptation. Then there's intellectual meaning that is uh what

1336
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.370
we think is objectively meaningful. That is what we

1337
01:10:48.379 --> 01:10:52.830
think is rationally defensible as, as meaningful. Um What

1338
01:10:52.839 --> 01:10:57.129
we think the uh coherent and principled uh answer

1339
01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.149
is to, to the meaning of life. What are,

1340
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.660
what are actual reasons are for, for living and

1341
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:04.529
caring for families and supporting our, our political tribe

1342
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:07.970
uh that uh is very much unique to intellectuals.

1343
01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:09.669
At least in my personal experience I could be

1344
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.000
wrong. You know, I'm, I'm happy to see some

1345
01:11:12.009 --> 01:11:13.979
data challenging me, but it seems like if you

1346
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:17.120
poll the general population and you ask them, you

1347
01:11:17.129 --> 01:11:20.589
know, how much they think about existentialism or nihilism

1348
01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.419
or Camu or Sarre or how much they, they

1349
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.290
try to, how much they care about having a

1350
01:11:25.299 --> 01:11:29.979
coherent uh uh worldview or philosophy. I would bet

1351
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:33.220
you that you would see uh uh highly educated

1352
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:35.520
people uh answering yes to those questions at a

1353
01:11:35.529 --> 01:11:38.680
much higher frequency. Uh And so, in that sense,

1354
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:41.250
I don't think most people care about the meaning

1355
01:11:41.259 --> 01:11:44.569
of life. Um IN, in that intellectual sense,

1356
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.640
you know, whenever I think about the uh intellectual

1357
01:11:49.649 --> 01:11:53.560
kind of meaning of life, you were just referring

1358
01:11:53.569 --> 01:11:57.109
to there every time it comes to my mind

1359
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.009
that uh Socratic uh uh, that, that quote from

1360
01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.560
Socrates where he says something along the lines, the

1361
01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:11.580
unexamined life is not worth living. That like, really

1362
01:12:11.589 --> 01:12:15.390
is that, is, that, is, is really life just

1363
01:12:15.399 --> 01:12:18.540
about, I don't know, overthinking.

1364
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:24.740
Yeah. I, I find it really surprising that intellectual

1365
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.580
sort of hold that quote in reverence to me

1366
01:12:27.589 --> 01:12:30.390
that's kind of, I find it really kind of

1367
01:12:30.399 --> 01:12:32.950
disgusting quote to be perfectly honest. I find it

1368
01:12:32.959 --> 01:12:37.450
elitist, uh, and, and, and smugly superior. It's an

1369
01:12:37.459 --> 01:12:39.680
implicit dig at people who don't spend their whole

1370
01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.729
life philosophizing. It's basically saying that those people, their

1371
01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:47.200
lives aren't worth living. That's a terrible sentiment. Absolutely

1372
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:49.080
despicable when you, when you really think about it.

1373
01:12:49.089 --> 01:12:52.229
So, it, it, it continuously surprises me that intellectuals

1374
01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.600
hold up this quote as a, you know, as

1375
01:12:55.609 --> 01:12:57.759
this symbol of, of meaning and virtue. I think

1376
01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:03.299
it's just, um, smug elitism, uh, masquerading as, as,

1377
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:04.399
uh, as philosophy.

1378
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.439
Yeah. But, uh, I, I mean, going on with

1379
01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:12.279
the cynicism here, I guess so when it comes

1380
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:15.240
to the meaning of life and other sorts of,

1381
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:22.189
for example, existential questions that uh highly intellectual, over

1382
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.759
educated people uh care about. I mean, do you

1383
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:32.069
have any idea if they really do care about

1384
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.870
them for the sake of acquiring some sort of

1385
01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:40.910
knowledge about particular kinds of questions, or do you

1386
01:13:40.919 --> 01:13:45.589
think that they like to discuss them among themselves,

1387
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.359
mostly for the sake of social signaling, showing off

1388
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:53.189
their intellect and stuff like

1389
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.890
that? Yeah. So uh I, I would argue that

1390
01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:59.990
that the answer is, is very much the latter.

1391
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.490
Um I, I don't mean to upset anyone, but

1392
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.049
I do think this is the, the best explanation

1393
01:14:05.419 --> 01:14:08.470
uh for, for what's going on here, which isn't

1394
01:14:08.479 --> 01:14:10.490
to say that, you know, I look down upon

1395
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.990
this, I engage in it myself. I love philosophizing

1396
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.720
about the meaning of life. I, I, me

1397
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:19.459
too. I have almost 300 philosophy interviews on the

1398
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.629
show.

1399
01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:23.799
So, yeah. So just because I'm describing this as

1400
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:27.000
kind of social signaling um and, and bullshit doesn't

1401
01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:28.689
mean that it's, it's bad or I don't like

1402
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.410
it. I actually love it that I'm kind of

1403
01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:33.859
attacking myself here. Um But I do think it's

1404
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:36.120
a kind of BS um I don't think that

1405
01:14:36.509 --> 01:14:39.870
um the human mind has an innate or, or

1406
01:14:39.879 --> 01:14:44.740
deep seated desire for truth about abstract, irrelevant uh

1407
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.770
matters. I think we certainly have evolved a desire

1408
01:14:47.779 --> 01:14:52.310
for truth and concrete, practical relevant situations. That is

1409
01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:53.569
we want to know if there really is a

1410
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.319
tiger over there. We want to know if this

1411
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:57.520
canoe really has a hole in it or not.

1412
01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.330
We really want to know if our tool works

1413
01:14:59.339 --> 01:15:01.020
or if this food is safe to eat. Those

1414
01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.470
are the kinds of things that we evolved to

1415
01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:04.259
care about and, and, and evolved to care about

1416
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.779
having accurate beliefs about. But when it comes to

1417
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:09.700
the meaning of life, how on earth would that

1418
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:12.169
affect your fitness in any way? Why would we

1419
01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.910
care about having a correct view of that? That

1420
01:15:14.919 --> 01:15:19.580
strikes me as a very evolutionarily implausible desire. So

1421
01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:22.020
I think if we're going to explain discourse on

1422
01:15:22.029 --> 01:15:24.209
the meaning of life, we cannot appeal to any

1423
01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.279
deep seated motive for truth seeking and in these,

1424
01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.520
in these matters, I think we have to look

1425
01:15:29.529 --> 01:15:31.799
in other directions. I think we have to look

1426
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.959
to the social aspect of these debates because after

1427
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:37.035
all debates are social, they are not just, you

1428
01:15:37.044 --> 01:15:40.805
know, one individual thinking to himself or herself. Uh

1429
01:15:40.814 --> 01:15:43.645
If that's what uh you know, pondering the meaning

1430
01:15:43.654 --> 01:15:46.705
of life was like, uh it would be unrecognizable

1431
01:15:46.714 --> 01:15:48.955
to us. No, this, these, these discussions are very

1432
01:15:48.964 --> 01:15:51.484
social. Uh THEY have all sorts of, of social

1433
01:15:51.495 --> 01:15:54.910
implications, all sorts of status implications. Um We tend

1434
01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:57.299
to praise people who have, you know, well thought

1435
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:00.899
out uplifting um philosophies of life as, as humane,

1436
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:04.020
as, as wise, as virtuous and we really seek

1437
01:16:04.029 --> 01:16:06.810
that kind of acclaim and, and esteem from our

1438
01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:09.740
peers. I think philosophers love that kind of acclaim.

1439
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.740
They love to be called wise and humane and,

1440
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:16.069
and insightful. Um So I think the key here

1441
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.259
is, is thinking about, you know, what an intellectual

1442
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:20.959
is, what is an over educated person, what trait

1443
01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:24.439
makes them that way. And I think the clearest

1444
01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.779
answer is that they are hyper reasoners, their reasoning

1445
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:34.299
faculty is uh uh very online uh and intensely

1446
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:37.919
activated uh all the time. That's what I think

1447
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:39.250
in, in like there are people who love to

1448
01:16:39.259 --> 01:16:42.290
reason and we all have reasoning faculties. Some of

1449
01:16:42.299 --> 01:16:45.049
us have, you know, you know, stronger reasoning faculties

1450
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.140
and we like to reason more frequently than others,

1451
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:50.640
but we all have it. Uh And uh and

1452
01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:53.080
I think to understand why intellectuals debate the meaning

1453
01:16:53.089 --> 01:16:55.040
of life, we have to understand what reasoning is

1454
01:16:55.049 --> 01:16:56.959
and what it's all about and why reasoning evolved.

1455
01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.339
Um And the theory I like most about what

1456
01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:02.040
reasoning is uh comes from Hugo Mercier, who I

1457
01:17:02.049 --> 01:17:05.270
believe you've had on the podcast before. And he

1458
01:17:05.279 --> 01:17:08.899
thinks that reasoning evolved for two purposes, one is

1459
01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:13.120
arguing and the other is rationalizing. So we reason

1460
01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.250
to win debates uh and resolve conflicts in our

1461
01:17:16.259 --> 01:17:20.609
favor. Um And we also reason to excuse justify

1462
01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.299
and rationalize our behavior so that we look good

1463
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:25.600
to our peers. That's basically what reasoning is all

1464
01:17:25.609 --> 01:17:30.609
about according to, to uh Hugo Mercier. Um There

1465
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.160
are all sorts of nuances here. And II, I

1466
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:33.660
don't want to give a whole overview of his

1467
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:36.490
theory, but that's the gist. Um And uh if

1468
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.939
we see reasoning as fundamentally about arguing and rationalizing,

1469
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.729
then we can see why these hyper reasoning weirdos

1470
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.600
are so obsessed with the meaning of life. What

1471
01:17:44.609 --> 01:17:46.495
they're doing is they're finding a way to win

1472
01:17:46.504 --> 01:17:49.634
arguments with one another and rationalize their lives. That

1473
01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:52.515
is they're trying to come up with a justification

1474
01:17:52.524 --> 01:17:55.104
for, for their life choices, the, you know, the

1475
01:17:55.115 --> 01:17:58.884
justification for why they support the uh haphazard and

1476
01:17:58.895 --> 01:18:03.069
arbitrary political coalition, they support uh they're trying to

1477
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.149
come up with a rationalization for why they're alive

1478
01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.310
at all. Uh You know, that's, that's a big

1479
01:18:08.319 --> 01:18:09.950
question, you know, why don't, why don't we commit

1480
01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:12.799
suicide? Uh I think the answer is there are,

1481
01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:14.629
there are clear evolutionary reasons why we would be

1482
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.580
afraid of committing suicide. Uh But that doesn't sound

1483
01:18:17.589 --> 01:18:19.759
as pretty as, oh, I'm alive because I want

1484
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.850
to pursue some high minded value or I want

1485
01:18:21.859 --> 01:18:23.830
to make the world a better place or pursue

1486
01:18:23.839 --> 01:18:27.399
justice or equality or um or any other uh

1487
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:32.330
value. So I think basically what, what uh conversations

1488
01:18:32.339 --> 01:18:34.060
and debates about the meaning of life are, are,

1489
01:18:34.069 --> 01:18:36.279
are a kind of status competition. Uh And the

1490
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:39.810
status competition might take a variety of forms. Um

1491
01:18:39.819 --> 01:18:42.080
uh It might take the form of virtue, status

1492
01:18:42.089 --> 01:18:45.669
or, or wisdom, status um or, or, or whatever,

1493
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.240
but I think that's ultimately what it's all about

1494
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.339
uh and uh apologies for that cynical view. But

1495
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:53.319
I think it might help with uh with existential

1496
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:56.200
angst to realize that your existential angst is uh

1497
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:57.810
sometimes uh bullshit.

1498
01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.939
No, I mean, at least as far as I'm

1499
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.299
concerned, we do not have to apologize at all

1500
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:08.160
also because I mean, o of course, again, uh

1501
01:19:08.169 --> 01:19:11.970
it's fine uh to be interested in all these

1502
01:19:11.979 --> 01:19:14.990
sorts of questions and I am interested in them

1503
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.160
myself and I explore them on the show several

1504
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:21.879
times. So, but uh I guess that the BS

1505
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:25.740
part here is really about the fact that people

1506
01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:29.709
and it's not their fault to some extent because

1507
01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.970
most of these happens subconsciously. So people are not

1508
01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:39.069
really do not really have direct access to what's

1509
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.259
motivating them to perform a particular kind of behavior

1510
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:47.109
in this case showing off intellectually, for example. Uh

1511
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.270
BUT the BS is really about them thinking that

1512
01:19:51.399 --> 01:19:55.354
the arguments they're making uh the law they bring

1513
01:19:55.365 --> 01:19:57.294
to the table. And all of that is really

1514
01:19:57.305 --> 01:20:02.424
about the content of what they're saying and not

1515
01:20:02.435 --> 01:20:08.075
about, for example, increasing their status or uh so

1516
01:20:08.084 --> 01:20:14.625
socially signaling their intellectual prowess or something like that

1517
01:20:14.634 --> 01:20:19.984
also, because lots of that uh as a clear

1518
01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:22.785
fitness benefits. Right.

1519
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:27.189
Yes, exactly. Yeah. If we're trying to explain AAA

1520
01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.910
costly human behavior, a costly investment of time and

1521
01:20:30.919 --> 01:20:33.419
energy, I think we have to try to explain

1522
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:35.919
it first in ways that make evolutionary sense and

1523
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:37.689
the way you describe it as social signaling and

1524
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.299
status competition, that makes a whole lot of evolutionary

1525
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:42.779
sense. The idea that we are intrinsically interested in

1526
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:44.879
the abstract meaning of life for its own sake

1527
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:47.569
makes no evolutionary sense whatsoever. So I think all

1528
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:50.240
else equal, we should favor the theories and explanations

1529
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.450
that make more evolutionary sense because we know evolution

1530
01:20:52.459 --> 01:20:54.609
is true. Uh And all of our theories should

1531
01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.319
ultimately be consistent with it. And that's, that's my

1532
01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.290
pitch for Darwinian cynicism.

1533
01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:01.430
At the end of the day, the question would

1534
01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:06.410
be if there was no social aspect to any

1535
01:21:06.419 --> 01:21:10.569
of these, would you still really be interested in

1536
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:15.259
thinking about the meaning of life or arguing about

1537
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.930
the meaning of life and other questions like that?

1538
01:21:18.279 --> 01:21:19.290
Right? It's,

1539
01:21:19.299 --> 01:21:21.854
it's interesting. Uh Part of me wants to say

1540
01:21:21.865 --> 01:21:23.495
yes and part of me wants to say no

1541
01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:26.615
because I know my own inner press secretary wants

1542
01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.785
me to deny that I'm, I'm motivated by these

1543
01:21:28.794 --> 01:21:32.274
ugly things but, but my rational intellectual brain says

1544
01:21:32.285 --> 01:21:35.765
yes, of course. Um So, uh yes, ultimately, I'm

1545
01:21:35.774 --> 01:21:37.895
a human being too. Um I'm just as motivated

1546
01:21:37.904 --> 01:21:40.455
by these uh social signaling and status motivations as

1547
01:21:40.464 --> 01:21:42.535
any other human. And I'm just as motivated to

1548
01:21:42.544 --> 01:21:45.379
deny that I have these motivations as any. I

1549
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.430
think that's a big part of a big part

1550
01:21:47.439 --> 01:21:49.859
of our, of our status competition. Is denying that

1551
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:52.180
we're competing for status because if you come out

1552
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:54.450
as a status seeker, as a social climber, as

1553
01:21:54.459 --> 01:21:58.120
a vous narcissist, uh you're going to look bad,

1554
01:21:58.129 --> 01:22:01.029
you're going to lose status. So overtly seeking status

1555
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.009
lowers your status, which means that we have to

1556
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.990
seek status covertly and we have to be in

1557
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.839
denial about it. We have to come up with

1558
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:11.549
pretty uh uh rationalizations and self flattering stories about

1559
01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.729
what we're really pursuing, which is not status but

1560
01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.689
some high minded, sacred value like truth or justice

1561
01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:20.000
or beauty or authenticity or whatever. Um And that's

1562
01:22:20.009 --> 01:22:21.229
where a lot of our bullshit comes from, I

1563
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.459
think is, is trying to cover up the ugly

1564
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:27.319
facts of our status competition and uh present them

1565
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:31.759
as pretty and impartially altruistic and benevolent uh ironically

1566
01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:33.759
for the purpose of winning those very same status

1567
01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:34.459
competitions.

1568
01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:39.129
Yeah. And perhaps even this entire conversation is just

1569
01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.470
boils down to status seeking

1570
01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:45.609
ultimately. Sadly, yes, which isn't to say it's bad.

1571
01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.580
So one thing I've, I've, I'm coming to terms

1572
01:22:47.589 --> 01:22:49.569
with is that just because something is bullshit or,

1573
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.290
or is a status game doesn't mean it's bad.

1574
01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.000
Uh Because if, if I were to take that

1575
01:22:54.009 --> 01:22:55.410
view, then I would have to think that everything

1576
01:22:55.419 --> 01:22:57.490
is, is bad and that is, is, is an

1577
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.970
unlivable philosophy. So I, the way I think about

1578
01:23:00.979 --> 01:23:02.589
it is yes, what we're, what we're doing here

1579
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.819
is ultimately a kind of status game that doesn't

1580
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:06.250
mean it's bad and that doesn't mean it's not

1581
01:23:06.259 --> 01:23:07.930
useful and it doesn't mean it's not improving the

1582
01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:09.779
world in some way. Certainly we're going to be

1583
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:11.600
biased to think that it's useful and that it's

1584
01:23:11.609 --> 01:23:13.660
improving the world in, in, in some way. Uh,

1585
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:15.439
BUT just because we're biased to think that doesn't

1586
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:16.839
mean it's, it's not true.

1587
01:23:18.089 --> 01:23:21.689
So, another thing that you wrote about in one

1588
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.959
of your posts, uh is, uh and earlier, I've

1589
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:29.410
asked you about this, at least to some extent

1590
01:23:29.419 --> 01:23:32.660
when I asked you about moral foundations theory. But

1591
01:23:32.959 --> 01:23:37.959
what function the morality serve exactly because we have

1592
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:42.600
this idea or this common idea that morality is

1593
01:23:42.609 --> 01:23:47.359
really about making us good or better people. But

1594
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.410
is that really what morality is about?

1595
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah. So I don't think it's what it's uh

1596
01:23:54.069 --> 01:23:57.100
about. Um So I have a, a post on

1597
01:23:57.109 --> 01:24:00.100
everything is bullshit called morality is not nice. Uh

1598
01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:02.279
In which I argue that morality is not, in

1599
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:05.259
fact nice. Uh It's quite mean. Um If you

1600
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.890
think about all of the awful stuff that has

1601
01:24:07.899 --> 01:24:10.700
happened throughout history, uh It has all had a

1602
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:16.149
very high minded moral justification, purges pogroms, inquisitions, genocides,

1603
01:24:16.379 --> 01:24:22.830
um Eugenics, uh uh uh conquests, colonialization. Um uh

1604
01:24:22.839 --> 01:24:27.000
YOU name it, it all comes accompanied with immoral

1605
01:24:27.009 --> 01:24:31.560
justification. We cannot commit injustice without thinking we're pursuing

1606
01:24:31.569 --> 01:24:35.600
justice, we cannot behave immorally without thinking we're behaving

1607
01:24:35.609 --> 01:24:40.560
morally. Uh We need our moral justifications and our

1608
01:24:40.569 --> 01:24:45.930
moral rationalizations in order to effectively mobilize groups against

1609
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:50.779
rivals. Um So that is what I think a

1610
01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:55.120
lot of morality is about. Um IT'S about mobilizing

1611
01:24:55.129 --> 01:24:58.899
groups against rivals. And the way we do that

1612
01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:02.069
is by creating self serving narratives that frame the

1613
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.279
group as morally superior and the rivals as morally

1614
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:11.620
inferior. Um And uh I think way too much

1615
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.160
of the scholarly literature on morality takes an overly

1616
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:18.959
sunny view of what it's all about. Um That

1617
01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:21.120
is if you think about morality from a Darwinian

1618
01:25:21.129 --> 01:25:25.279
perspective, ultimately, it exists because it, it helped our

1619
01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:28.640
ancestors out compete their rivals. That is uh ancestors

1620
01:25:28.649 --> 01:25:31.100
who had the genes for morality did better, got

1621
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:33.899
more stuff than ancestors who didn't have those genes.

1622
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.229
And then you have to ask yourself, well, how

1623
01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.189
did they get more stuff than their non moral

1624
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.020
rivals? Well, there are only so many ways, right?

1625
01:25:41.029 --> 01:25:43.830
They could either physically exclude them from that stuff,

1626
01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.819
just, just uh not interact with them or, or,

1627
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:49.790
or just avoid them. That's not very nice. They

1628
01:25:49.799 --> 01:25:52.529
could uh violently exclude them, they could hurt them

1629
01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:56.250
or kill them, not very nice. Um They could

1630
01:25:56.259 --> 01:25:59.160
lie to them and, and to, to keep them

1631
01:25:59.169 --> 01:26:02.709
away. That that's another tactic. Uh Really, there's no

1632
01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.229
way that one group of primates can get more

1633
01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.060
stuff than another group of primates systematically throughout evolutionary

1634
01:26:08.069 --> 01:26:10.689
history without being mean to that other group of

1635
01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.649
primates. There's just no way to do it. So

1636
01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:14.700
I think morality, while it is very much about

1637
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:16.589
cooper operation, as a lot of scholars have argued,

1638
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.140
it also must necessarily have a competitive side. That

1639
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:24.189
is there must be some kind of competition at

1640
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.319
the heart of it. Yes, we co-operate, but we

1641
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:30.609
co-operate to outcompete our rivals. Yes, we try to

1642
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.520
be to, to show off our virtue and to,

1643
01:26:33.529 --> 01:26:35.160
and to be good cooper partners. But what we're

1644
01:26:35.169 --> 01:26:37.729
doing there is we're competing with other people to

1645
01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.750
be better co-operative partners than they are. And I

1646
01:26:40.759 --> 01:26:42.970
think too often the competitive side of morality has

1647
01:26:42.979 --> 01:26:46.384
been ignored in favor of the co-operative side. Ironically,

1648
01:26:46.395 --> 01:26:49.095
because that serves the functions of morality. That is

1649
01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:51.935
if I'm trying to mobilize a larger group than

1650
01:26:51.944 --> 01:26:54.154
my rivals, I have to make it seem like

1651
01:26:54.165 --> 01:26:56.154
my moral agenda is better for more people than

1652
01:26:56.165 --> 01:26:58.575
it really is that it's more sunny and co-operative

1653
01:26:58.584 --> 01:27:00.595
than it really is that it's less ugly and

1654
01:27:00.604 --> 01:27:02.575
dark and competitive than it really is in order

1655
01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.944
to rally more people to my side and away

1656
01:27:04.955 --> 01:27:08.950
from the other side. So that's what I think

1657
01:27:09.089 --> 01:27:12.359
uh morality is about at the end of the

1658
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:15.410
day. Um It's just as much about competition as

1659
01:27:15.419 --> 01:27:16.919
it is about cooper operation and it is, I

1660
01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:20.080
think the leading cause of immorality in our species.

1661
01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:21.830
I think it is the leading cause of cruelty

1662
01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:24.930
of violence. Uh There's an excellent book called Virtuous

1663
01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:28.790
Violence by uh Lan Fis Conte Re arguing. Uh,

1664
01:27:28.799 --> 01:27:31.470
THAT pretty much all violence around the world has

1665
01:27:31.689 --> 01:27:34.910
a moral justification. It's all done in the name

1666
01:27:34.919 --> 01:27:37.359
of morality. And that far more violence is done

1667
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:39.479
by normal people who think they're doing the right

1668
01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:44.859
thing than, uh, is committed by sociopaths. Um, AND

1669
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:46.310
so I think we really need to have a

1670
01:27:46.319 --> 01:27:50.060
reckoning with morality. Uh, AND the role it plays

1671
01:27:50.069 --> 01:27:51.689
in our society. Mhm.

1672
01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.890
Yeah, I, I mean, I was just about to

1673
01:27:53.899 --> 01:27:57.350
mention that book Virtues Violence and I talked about

1674
01:27:57.359 --> 01:28:01.459
about it with Alan Fisk back in late 2018

1675
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.410
or early 2019, something like that on the show.

1676
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:07.899
Uh And yeah, it's, it's a very compelling argument

1677
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:11.069
that he and his co-author make there, right? But

1678
01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.520
that, I mean, when, for example, uh you want

1679
01:28:15.529 --> 01:28:19.770
to uh take revenge or something like that and

1680
01:28:19.779 --> 01:28:26.430
you morally justify your revenge or you base some

1681
01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:32.140
sort of uh individual or collective action on morality

1682
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:36.549
and on being wronged, for example, that uh more

1683
01:28:36.654 --> 01:28:40.904
easily can lead, you can lead you and your

1684
01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:47.944
fellow, I mean, allies to commit atrocious acts, right?

1685
01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:51.884
Like for example, even in some cases, genocide and

1686
01:28:51.895 --> 01:28:52.584
stuff like that.

1687
01:28:53.609 --> 01:28:59.560
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um I, I have no descent

1688
01:28:59.569 --> 01:29:00.839
to your opinion.

1689
01:29:02.069 --> 01:29:05.950
OK. So let's get into one of the last

1690
01:29:05.959 --> 01:29:09.109
topics here. So earlier you mentioned at a certain

1691
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.669
point, social paradoxes. So what, what are social paradoxes?

1692
01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.689
What does that mean? Exactly.

1693
01:29:17.529 --> 01:29:20.290
Yeah. So it's, it's usually good to give a

1694
01:29:20.299 --> 01:29:23.149
few examples of social paradoxes rather than, than give

1695
01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.060
you the definition. I think that'll be easier to

1696
01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:26.839
understand what it is. I'm talking about. So here,

1697
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:30.700
I'll give you a few examples. Um We um

1698
01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:34.089
try very hard to make people think that we

1699
01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:38.709
don't care what they think. Um We uh rebel

1700
01:29:38.779 --> 01:29:42.390
against social norms in the exact same way as

1701
01:29:42.399 --> 01:29:47.569
everyone else. Um We uh authentically express our true

1702
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:51.270
selves, not who society wants us to be because

1703
01:29:51.279 --> 01:29:53.959
that is ultimately who society wants us to be.

1704
01:29:54.479 --> 01:30:00.279
Um We uh um oppose virtue signaling to signal

1705
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:06.080
our virtue. Uh We um bravely defy social norms

1706
01:30:06.089 --> 01:30:10.669
so that people will praise us. Um We uh

1707
01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.680
um avoid being manipulative um to get people to

1708
01:30:14.689 --> 01:30:18.890
do what we want them to do. Uh We

1709
01:30:18.899 --> 01:30:23.390
uh where we avoid being defensive uh in order

1710
01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:26.229
to ultimately defend ourselves. Uh Those are just a

1711
01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.689
few examples of social paradoxes. What's the common thread

1712
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.560
to all of them? The common thread is that

1713
01:30:31.569 --> 01:30:36.040
they ultimately involve a uh a signal that is

1714
01:30:36.049 --> 01:30:41.060
concealed from both the signaler and the recipient. That

1715
01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:44.129
is the virtue signaler does not know that they

1716
01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:48.470
are a virtue signaler. Uh And neither do the

1717
01:30:48.479 --> 01:30:51.729
recipients who award them virtue. If they thought of

1718
01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.790
them as virtue signalers, they wouldn't award them virtue,

1719
01:30:53.799 --> 01:30:56.339
they would think they were, you know, narcissistic or,

1720
01:30:56.350 --> 01:31:00.479
or whatever, right? Um The brave norm, violator does

1721
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:03.049
not know that they're actually, in fact, just conforming

1722
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.439
to the norms of their particular subculture. And neither

1723
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:08.509
do the members of that subculture, the authentic person

1724
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.790
who's authentically expressing their true self, uh, does not

1725
01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.799
know that they're behaving exactly how society wants them

1726
01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.520
to behave and neither does the society who praises

1727
01:31:16.529 --> 01:31:19.680
them as authentic. Right. So these are signals being

1728
01:31:19.689 --> 01:31:22.020
sent that are concealed from both the signaler and

1729
01:31:22.029 --> 01:31:22.750
the recipient.

1730
01:31:24.439 --> 01:31:28.459
A and so why is it that uh things

1731
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:33.379
like status seeking and virtue signaling have to occur

1732
01:31:33.569 --> 01:31:36.259
uh covertly for them to work?

1733
01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.509
Yeah. So the answer is kind of complicated. Uh

1734
01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.640
So I think it has to do with um

1735
01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:46.399
are a couple of cognitive abilities. We have one

1736
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:49.839
ability is that we are just eagerly in search

1737
01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:52.910
of information about a person's character. We are, are,

1738
01:31:52.919 --> 01:31:54.990
you know, likely to draw all sorts of inferences

1739
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.580
about them from the subtlest things they say are

1740
01:31:57.589 --> 01:31:59.779
and, and, and the subtlest behaviors they engage in.

1741
01:32:00.009 --> 01:32:01.939
Uh WE, we want to know what kind of

1742
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:04.129
person I want to know what kind of person

1743
01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.189
you are. And I'm going to judge you in

1744
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:08.500
all sorts of ways unconsciously, unconsciously and draw inferences,

1745
01:32:08.509 --> 01:32:10.060
you know, you said this thing that means that

1746
01:32:10.069 --> 01:32:11.970
you're this type of person. So that's what I

1747
01:32:11.979 --> 01:32:14.390
call QE based inferences using others behaviors as a

1748
01:32:14.399 --> 01:32:17.830
cue to their, their underlying traits. Uh And then

1749
01:32:17.839 --> 01:32:20.620
there's uh recursive mentalis. So that's the ability to

1750
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:23.790
get inside other other people's heads. Um AND think

1751
01:32:23.799 --> 01:32:26.870
about what, what they might be thinking about, uh

1752
01:32:26.879 --> 01:32:28.310
uh or what they might want or what they

1753
01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:30.790
might have intended. And the recursive part comes from

1754
01:32:30.799 --> 01:32:33.299
embedding mental states inside other mental states. So, for

1755
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:38.029
example, um I want you to think that I'm

1756
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:41.950
smart, but I don't want you to think that

1757
01:32:41.959 --> 01:32:44.649
I want you to think that I'm smart because

1758
01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:45.919
if you thought that you would think I was

1759
01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:49.479
a douche, right? So that's an example of recursive

1760
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:52.370
mentalis. Their thoughts about thoughts, you know, beliefs about

1761
01:32:52.379 --> 01:32:56.240
desires, beliefs about desires, about thoughts, uh beliefs about

1762
01:32:56.250 --> 01:33:02.009
intentions, about thoughts, et cetera. That's a lot apologies.

1763
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.890
Let me get back to social paradoxes. Why, why,

1764
01:33:04.899 --> 01:33:07.770
why does virtue signaling have to occur covertly? Well,

1765
01:33:08.009 --> 01:33:11.720
because being an overt virtue signaler trying to show

1766
01:33:11.729 --> 01:33:14.390
off your virtue, that's a signal. But it is

1767
01:33:14.399 --> 01:33:17.120
also at the same time become a cue of

1768
01:33:17.129 --> 01:33:21.330
one's underlying vanity and self absorption and selfishness and

1769
01:33:21.339 --> 01:33:23.479
pettiness. And perhaps even one's low status, maybe you're

1770
01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:26.169
insecure uh about yourself because you're low status and

1771
01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:27.859
you want to try to show off uh to

1772
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:30.930
improve your status, whatever, whatever the reason, you know,

1773
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.359
there we draw all sorts of nega negative inferences

1774
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:37.020
about people when they overtly uh and conspicuously show

1775
01:33:37.029 --> 01:33:40.279
off their virtue. So that means that if we

1776
01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:43.140
want to gain virtue, we cannot let people know

1777
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:45.669
that we're virtue signaling. We have to somehow signal

1778
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.629
our virtue without making it seem like we're signaling

1779
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.950
our virtue. Um And one way of doing that

1780
01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.970
is to hide the fact that we're virtue, virtue

1781
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.729
signaling, not merely from the people we're signaling to,

1782
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:59.259
but also from ourselves. That is we deceive ourselves.

1783
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:01.459
We think we're not actually virtue signaling, we're, we're

1784
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:04.990
pursuing some high minded value. Um And, and, and

1785
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.640
the same story could be told about status. If

1786
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:09.529
you're a status seeker, people draw negative inferences about

1787
01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:12.180
you, you're selfish, you're competitive, maybe you're low status

1788
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:15.850
and insecure. We don't like status seekers. Uh So

1789
01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:17.810
in order to achieve status, we must conceal the

1790
01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:20.140
fact that we're trying to achieve status that is

1791
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:23.959
status seeking must occur covertly and must be disguised

1792
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.620
uh in high minded uh uh benevolent terms.

1793
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:31.240
Uh uh I mean, and this will be my

1794
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:33.890
last question. I was just about to ask you

1795
01:34:33.899 --> 01:34:36.759
if this would connect in any way to self

1796
01:34:36.839 --> 01:34:41.850
deception in the sense that if we self deceive,

1797
01:34:41.859 --> 01:34:45.259
then it would be easier for us to uh

1798
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:50.250
behave in a way that would also lead to

1799
01:34:50.259 --> 01:34:56.419
uh let's say higher probability of uh faking our

1800
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:59.879
true motives to other people. I mean, for other

1801
01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:03.839
people to not really read what we're trying to

1802
01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:04.939
do there. Right.

1803
01:35:05.859 --> 01:35:08.870
Yeah. So there's a whole literature on the evolution

1804
01:35:08.879 --> 01:35:11.520
of self deception and, and then that um it

1805
01:35:11.529 --> 01:35:14.339
makes us more successful at deceiving others if we

1806
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:18.100
can deceive ourselves first. And I think the general

1807
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:23.250
argument here is sound. Um, AND I think one

1808
01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:25.240
way I'd like to, I like to frame it

1809
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:29.270
is in terms of a lawyer who practices their

1810
01:35:29.279 --> 01:35:31.660
opening statement to themselves before they deliver it to

1811
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:34.660
the jury. Right. Maybe they'll practice in front of

1812
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:36.879
the mirror. I don't know. Um, BUT they want

1813
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:38.779
to make sure that they'll, they'll hear themselves giving

1814
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:40.870
the arguments and if it's convincing to themselves and

1815
01:35:40.879 --> 01:35:42.560
if it sounds good to themselves, then it probably

1816
01:35:42.569 --> 01:35:44.580
sounds good to, to other people. And I think

1817
01:35:44.589 --> 01:35:46.720
we do that with ourselves. That is we, we,

1818
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:50.750
we first try out arguments on ourselves before we

1819
01:35:50.759 --> 01:35:53.919
try them out on others. And what we're often

1820
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:56.589
arguing about is how good we are or how

1821
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.220
not bad we are. So we, we, we first

1822
01:35:59.229 --> 01:36:01.229
try to convince ourselves that we're good people that

1823
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.899
we don't care about status. Uh And we rehearse

1824
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:05.240
those arguments in our head. And we, and we

1825
01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.450
sometimes even even do things in the world that

1826
01:36:07.459 --> 01:36:10.240
help us gather evidence for that picture of ourselves.

1827
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:12.870
We might actually donate to charity. So that later

1828
01:36:12.879 --> 01:36:14.240
on we can say, hey, I'm not a bad

1829
01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:17.220
person. I actually donate to charity, right? So we

1830
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:19.399
convince ourselves through talking to ourselves in our head

1831
01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:21.049
and making arguments to ourselves in our head and

1832
01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:24.160
anticipating future scenarios where we might be called out.

1833
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:26.859
And we also occasionally act in the world. So

1834
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:29.330
as to accumulate evidence of our good character that

1835
01:36:29.339 --> 01:36:32.770
we can, um, use later on. Uh, IF we're

1836
01:36:32.779 --> 01:36:36.779
ever challenged, that is we prepare, uh, like lawyers

1837
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:38.910
for, for trials that we may not ever be

1838
01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:40.709
in, but it's good to prepare in any case

1839
01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.870
because those trials could be hugely important, um, for

1840
01:36:43.879 --> 01:36:45.779
our fitness. Uh, THAT is if we're caught off

1841
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:48.930
guard by an accusation or an insult, uh, and

1842
01:36:48.939 --> 01:36:51.259
we have no argument to give in response that's

1843
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:52.810
going to be very bad for our fitness. We

1844
01:36:52.819 --> 01:36:54.620
want to prepare for those types of situations so

1845
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:56.620
that we can defend ourselves and defend our character.

1846
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:57.950
And I think a lot of our behavior is

1847
01:36:57.959 --> 01:37:00.859
oriented around that. So, yeah, that's how I construe

1848
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:04.910
self deception. Um, IT'S not literally lying to ourselves.

1849
01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:07.779
It's more like bullshitting ourselves. Uh I would, I

1850
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:09.689
would think of it more as, as, uh, self

1851
01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.330
bullshitting. We bullshit ourselves, uh in order to more

1852
01:37:12.339 --> 01:37:13.500
effectively bullshit others.

1853
01:37:14.729 --> 01:37:19.479
Ok, great. So let's end on that very cynical

1854
01:37:19.589 --> 01:37:21.799
note, I guess. But I, I, I'm also a

1855
01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:26.919
very big diogenes fan, so there's no problem with

1856
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:32.000
that. So David, uh, just before we go, would

1857
01:37:32.009 --> 01:37:34.620
you like to tell people where they can find

1858
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:35.899
you on the internet?

1859
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:39.709
Sure. Uh, YOU can find me on Twitter slash

1860
01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.350
X. Um, AT David pins off. Um, FEEL free

1861
01:37:43.359 --> 01:37:45.169
to DM me if you'd like, I'm always happy

1862
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:47.410
to talk to people. Uh, AND, uh, you can

1863
01:37:47.419 --> 01:37:50.290
find my substack, uh, uh it's called Everything is

1864
01:37:50.299 --> 01:37:54.089
bullshit and it's just everything is bullshit.substack.com.

1865
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:57.459
Great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

1866
01:37:57.470 --> 01:38:00.299
description box of the interview. And look, thank you

1867
