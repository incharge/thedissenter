00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.719
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.010
have a returned guest, Doctor Lydia Moland, he is

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.979
a professor of Philosophy at Colby College. Last time

5
00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.960
we talked about Hegel Marx, a little bit of

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.079
abolitionism and feminism in the 19th century. And today

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.700
we're focusing on her book, which is now on

8
00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:26.459
paperback as well. Lidia Mariah Child, a radical American

9
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:29.399
life. So, Doctor Moland, welcome back to the show.

10
00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.219
It's always a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.470
Thank you. Likewise. It's always a pleasure for me

12
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:34.500
to talk to you as well.

13
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.979
So, first of all, just before we get into

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.090
Lydia Child's personal story and her intellectual achievements and

15
00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.889
contributions, let me just ask you sort of more

16
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.450
personal question. So what got you interested first in

17
00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.529
American evolutionism, particularly from the 19th century?

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.750
Yes. Thank you for that question. So, as you

19
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.470
say, I'd spent my whole career doing uh German

20
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.550
philosophy. I wrote a couple books on Hegel wrote

21
00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:09.190
Salmon Schiller and other German idealists. I was very

22
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:14.300
happy doing that. Um And then after the 2016

23
00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:16.980
election, I had um in the United States, I

24
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:20.199
had a moment of thinking that I really needed

25
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.089
to change my life in order to react to

26
00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.889
the new political reality in my country. And I

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.459
started to wonder, um, what women in particular had

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.680
done to address moral emergencies in the past. And

29
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.319
I thought, well, I have some expertise in the

30
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.889
19th century. I know my, my way around the

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.300
thinkers there, um, and the obvious and I, I

32
00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:45.269
also had the feeling that it would be good

33
00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.400
for me as an American citizen to sort of

34
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.370
come home and think about my own country and

35
00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.019
its own history where I'd usually been thinking more

36
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:57.819
about Germany. So I, I just thought what, what

37
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.400
were American women? And I, I thought it would

38
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.019
be interesting to look at women doing with philosophy

39
00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:08.490
in the 19th century to especially to address moral

40
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.309
emergencies in their country. And obviously, the big moral

41
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.690
emergency in the United States in the 19th century

42
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.300
was uh slavery and the civil war in particular.

43
00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.839
And so I, I was very naive, but I

44
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.039
had a vague recollection that um women had been

45
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.039
important in the fight against slavery in the 19th

46
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.000
century. So I went to the Harvard Library for

47
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.259
the History of Women, the Schlesinger Library and asked

48
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.500
what they knew about women using philosophy in the

49
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.470
19th century. And they, they didn't have an immediate

50
00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.809
answer, but they gave me a box of folders

51
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.179
actually that someone else had asked to see the

52
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.070
day I happened to go and in that box

53
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.110
was a letter from this woman, Lydia Mariah child.

54
00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.880
I had never heard of her. I had no

55
00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.910
idea who she was, but the letter was so

56
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.949
electrifying to me. It was so um it spoke

57
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.059
to me so immediately it was clearly by one

58
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.330
activist to another. So someone who was trying to

59
00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:18.339
figure out how to address a moral question. Um

60
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.380
AND it, it spoke with such clarity and such

61
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.910
uh wisdom and so philosophically that I thought I

62
00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.550
should really look into this person. Um So I

63
00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.940
started looking into her. I couldn't believe what I

64
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.029
found. I couldn't believe how accomplished and how well

65
00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.279
known and how influential child was in her own

66
00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.940
life and that I had never heard of her.

67
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.630
Um And I was so impressed by the way,

68
00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.619
she used philosophical thought to tackle the major moral

69
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.429
issues of her time that I just kept thinking

70
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.089
and writing about her. And that's how I ended

71
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.539
up um writing this book.

72
00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.440
So tell us now then about her. Who was

73
00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.470
she? Exactly.

74
00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.940
Yeah. So she was born in 1802 in a

75
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.860
town called Medford Massachusetts, which is just uh is

76
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.149
very near Boston. Uh Her father was a baker.

77
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.209
He had been born um an American citizen um

78
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.759
just after the revolution. Um And, and actually, that's

79
00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:25.098
not true. He had been uh he was a

80
00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:28.128
boy still during the revolution. Anyway. So it had

81
00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.019
been a generation which people had gone from being

82
00:04:31.028 --> 00:04:34.778
British citizens to being American citizens. He was very

83
00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.989
patriotic, um, as were many people for that reason,

84
00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:40.269
but he had no formal education. He was a

85
00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:44.079
very successful baker but, um, not a, an intellectual.

86
00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:47.739
Uh, HIS wife also had no formal education. Um,

87
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.100
THEY, Lydia Maria child was the youngest of their

88
00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:55.040
Children. Um, THEY had no interest in educating girls.

89
00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:58.359
They had no interest in educating boys either but

90
00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:01.679
their, their son who was just five years older

91
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.309
than Lydia. Um His name was converse. He had

92
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.445
this inexplicable love of books and he was sort

93
00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:13.125
of mentored by the local teacher and the local

94
00:05:13.135 --> 00:05:17.404
minister. Um He loved books so much that the

95
00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:21.204
family doctor finally took his parents aside and said

96
00:05:21.214 --> 00:05:23.165
he's not going to be of any help to

97
00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:27.005
you in um the bakery. So you might as

98
00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.700
well send him to Harvard. So they sent him

99
00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:32.290
to Harvard um where he, he later became a

100
00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:36.029
professor at Harvard um in the Divinity School. Anyway,

101
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.910
all of that to say that she didn't have

102
00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:43.359
a uh an extensive education. She went to primary

103
00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.720
school but not to, there was no high school

104
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.299
for women like her, but she had a brother

105
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.779
who loved books and loved teaching her um about

106
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.700
the books he was reading. So as a very

107
00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:57.019
young woman sort of 1213 years old, she was

108
00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.899
reading Milton she was reading Shakespeare. Um She soon

109
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.380
discovered the novels of Walter Scott and this just

110
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.459
launched her into this world of ideas that she

111
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.750
remained enthusiastic about. Um, HER whole life. Anyway. So

112
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.890
she, she went from being a voracious reader to

113
00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:19.040
being a very early writer. She wrote her first

114
00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:22.179
novel when she was 22 years old. It was

115
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.609
still very unusual for a woman to write a

116
00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:28.679
novel in the United States or anywhere really. Um,

117
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.220
SO she published it pseudonymously or anonymously. She just

118
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.739
said it was by an American and it caused

119
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.040
a kind of, um, sensation, um, slash scandal. It

120
00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.940
was about, uh, a native American warrior who married

121
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.440
a European settler, um, which as you can imagine

122
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.869
was, um, was controversial, but it did well enough

123
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.429
that she became a fairly well known author. She

124
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.489
then followed that up by writing another novel by

125
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.200
writing children's fiction by starting to write other nonfiction.

126
00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:05.850
Um, AND that meant that by the time she

127
00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:10.079
was 30 she was something essentially unheard of was

128
00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:14.209
a self sufficient female author in the United States.

129
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.130
And she also published, um, a self help book

130
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.320
that was, it was a kind of combination of,

131
00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:28.839
um, recipes and um, medical advice, housekeeping tips. But

132
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.829
even there, and this is transitioning more to her

133
00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:35.160
thought. It's a very philosophical book. And so far

134
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.679
as she says, very clearly at the beginning, that

135
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.470
what she wants is for Americans to realize that

136
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.540
in order not to reinstate the aristocracy that they

137
00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:49.140
had just fought a war to get rid of

138
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.709
Americans needed to be self sufficient. They needed to

139
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.820
know how to take care of themselves, um how

140
00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:58.709
to make their own soap. Um And, and, and

141
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.829
cure their own diseases. And she really makes clear

142
00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.540
that this is a, a kind of political philosophy

143
00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:09.040
embodied in what Americans should be doing. So that

144
00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:11.140
was another thing that way in which I think

145
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.480
she sets up her real philosophical commitments, which become

146
00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:18.619
much clearer. Uh ONCE she encounters the abolitionist movement.

147
00:08:18.989 --> 00:08:22.489
But then when it comes to her personal, her

148
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.850
own intellectual path, she was mostly self taught, right?

149
00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.250
She was, and she was, she was very proud

150
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.789
of that and beyond being proud of that. I

151
00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:37.109
think she thought that it had saved her from

152
00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:42.619
some problems that trained intellectuals often encounter in their

153
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.229
moral lives. So this becomes a sort of theme

154
00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:49.909
that she in so far as she knew of

155
00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.369
professional philosophers, which she did, she knew um Ralph

156
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.340
Waldo Emerson, New Bronson Alcott, she could see that

157
00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:02.190
their education had sometimes made them very careful, very

158
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.900
conservative, very focused on thinking rather than doing. And

159
00:09:07.909 --> 00:09:10.900
in a way this was more true of Emerson,

160
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:17.609
um unwilling to engage in the messier of actual

161
00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:21.859
life. So most people, if they know anything about

162
00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:24.590
Emerson and slavery, think of him as a kind

163
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:28.250
of moral hero who came out very strongly, um,

164
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.080
in favor of John Brown after John Brown's raid

165
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.210
on Harper's ferry, which was meant to instigate, um,

166
00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:39.830
an insurrection among enslaved people. But actually Emerson came

167
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.330
to that very late. He was very tepid about

168
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.729
abolitionism for most of his life. Um, AND child

169
00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:51.250
ascribed to him and others then, um, the sort

170
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.090
of concern that they had let their educations get

171
00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:57.729
in the way of their moral compass. And so

172
00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:00.330
in a way, I think she felt lucky that

173
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.809
she didn't have that kind of um distraction. But

174
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.210
I'll, you know, I'll say too, as a young

175
00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:10.570
person, she engaged with Plato, she engaged with Locke.

176
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.659
Um She had a study group with Margaret Fuller

177
00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:17.380
on Locke and Amanda Stahl. She was very influenced

178
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.780
by Emmanuel Swedenborg who was a philosopher and mystic

179
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:24.849
in Sweden. Um So she, she had read very

180
00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.880
widely and, but yes, she was essentially self taught.

181
00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:32.789
But, but when did she start actually writing on

182
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.770
philosophy? Because if I understood correctly, at least in

183
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.849
her early writing career, she was rattling most uh

184
00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:42.520
she was writing mostly novels, right? But then when

185
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.789
did she, when exactly did she get she go

186
00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:48.919
into philosophical writings, let's say,

187
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.340
yeah, I would say that it really happened once

188
00:10:52.349 --> 00:10:59.179
she discovered abolitionism. So it's, it's really important for

189
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.619
Americans in particular to understand that abolitionism in the

190
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.260
18 thirties. So about the time she was 30

191
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:11.039
years old, was still a radical position among Americans.

192
00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:14.330
So I think many Americans think that most northerners

193
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.229
especially were against slavery from the beginning. And that's

194
00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:21.849
just not true. Even northerners who were against slavery

195
00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:26.650
were very uncomfortable, usually with the position of abolitionism,

196
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.570
which was the claim that slavery should end immediately,

197
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.590
not gradually and that it should end without compensation

198
00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:39.809
to enslavers. So to, to embrace a position like

199
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.359
that was essentially to become a kind of social

200
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:46.820
pariah. Um It was to risk ostracism and condemnation

201
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.809
by all of the kind of proper people, you

202
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.200
know, in somewhere like Boston, which was very concerned

203
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:58.630
with itself as the beacon of intellectual sophistication in

204
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.880
the United States. So child had also, you know,

205
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.760
disliked slavery, but then sort of tepid about, you

206
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.219
know, thinking, well, probably it's going away anyway and

207
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:14.150
probably it's not as bad as some people make

208
00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:17.979
it sound. But then in 1830 she met a

209
00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:21.820
man named William Lloyd Garrison who was a radical

210
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.859
abolitionist. He was a white man, but he had

211
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:28.989
moved to Boston to build on the abolitionist community

212
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.219
among black Americans there. And he as a, as

213
00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:36.559
a white author and editor was trying, was looking

214
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.659
for converts for people who he could, who could

215
00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:43.469
help him spread the message of abolitionism. And he

216
00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:46.820
knew that child was a very effective novelist so

217
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.969
that she could reach people emotionally. And he knew

218
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:53.239
that she was a very effective arguer because she'd

219
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.520
taken a position on on other issues before that.

220
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.010
And she had, she was a household name. She

221
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.979
was known in the north and the south for

222
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:06.210
her uh literature and for her advice um to

223
00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:09.150
all kinds of people, um including about, you know,

224
00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:12.659
very practical things. So he met with her, he

225
00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:15.109
and, and she describes meeting with him as a

226
00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:19.200
kind of conversion experience where the, as we say,

227
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.450
the scales fell from her eyes and she suddenly

228
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.809
realized that this thing that she hadn't thought about

229
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.979
carefully before um was absolutely true and deserved her

230
00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:35.039
devotion and attention for in all of her efforts.

231
00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.130
So at that point, I think she really started

232
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.260
to think philosophically, which is to say to think

233
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.840
about what kinds of arguments would work to change

234
00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:50.169
people's hearts and minds on this question. So in

235
00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:55.200
1833 she published the first book length argument against

236
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.710
slavery in the United States. It was called an

237
00:13:57.719 --> 00:14:01.969
appeal in favor of that class of Americans called

238
00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:05.919
Africans. And to my mind, it's um it's a

239
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:10.090
deep philosophical work for a couple of reasons. One

240
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.609
is that it asks the big questions, right? So

241
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:17.830
what is justice? What is humanity, what is truth?

242
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.109
What does it mean? Uh TO think of someone

243
00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:24.630
else as a human being? But also in so

244
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.070
far as, as it's a fire hose of argumentation.

245
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.679
So she takes all of the reasons and excuses

246
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.359
that people had been using people like her people

247
00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:40.809
in the North had been using to excuse their

248
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.289
apathy about slavery and she just takes them down

249
00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.719
one by one sometimes in a very socratic style.

250
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.950
So she'll, she'll put up um a kind of

251
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.359
um usual conventional reason for not interfering in the

252
00:14:56.369 --> 00:14:59.750
South, for instance. And then she'll just list all

253
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.280
of the reasons why that is a hypocritical position,

254
00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:05.599
why it's a nonsensical position, why it's intention with

255
00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:09.919
American values, et cetera. So this book had several

256
00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:12.320
chapters. It had a couple of chapters on the

257
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.440
history of slavery, the economics of slavery, the moral

258
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.359
problems with slavery, the intellectual character of Africans and

259
00:15:21.369 --> 00:15:25.760
their descendants, et cetera. And then the last chapter

260
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.119
is aimed squarely at northerners. Um And the first

261
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.719
sentence of it is something like while we bestow

262
00:15:35.729 --> 00:15:41.119
our earnest disapprobation on our brethren in the South,

263
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.200
let us not flatter ourselves that we are any

264
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:51.090
better than they. This was absolute treason as far

265
00:15:51.099 --> 00:15:54.030
as most people in Boston were concerned to say

266
00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:58.429
that Bostonians were as guilty in the, on the

267
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.049
topic of slavery, as people in the South was

268
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.359
a, was a heresy. Um So she was really

269
00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:06.770
ostracized at that point. Again, I think there are

270
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.900
some interesting parallels to Socrates here, right? So she,

271
00:16:09.909 --> 00:16:12.530
she kind of shows up in the public square,

272
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:17.109
she asks people kind of basic questions about their

273
00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:21.880
thoughtlessly held beliefs and shows them to be um

274
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:27.979
deeply hypocritical and uninformed and in the, and captives

275
00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:33.900
of terrible arguments, destroys those arguments and is essentially

276
00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:37.099
that she wasn't killed, but she was, um, was

277
00:16:37.109 --> 00:16:39.869
ostracized and there were times in which her life

278
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.250
was threatened and, you know, it was a, it

279
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.150
was a very dangerous position to take, especially as

280
00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:48.820
a woman. So when, when she had published these

281
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.099
other books, people had been uneasy and should women

282
00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:54.650
really be writing novels and, you know, should they

283
00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:58.950
really be, you know, messing around in these topics?

284
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.349
But for a woman to talk about economics and

285
00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:05.589
politics and history and then to call northerners hypocrites,

286
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.500
I was really beyond the pale. Um So at

287
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.229
that point, then her life really changed. Uh She

288
00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:15.848
lost her income from her books. People stopped buying

289
00:17:15.858 --> 00:17:19.839
her books. Um And she and her husband essentially

290
00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:23.358
lived in poverty for the rest of their lives.

291
00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:25.530
So there's lots more to say about her philosophy.

292
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.160
But I, I would say that is, is one

293
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.609
of the moments that I would say becomes a

294
00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:32.670
kind of philosophical turn for her. She never called

295
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.209
herself a philosopher. In fact, she um resisted being

296
00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:39.510
called that I think in part because she was

297
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.900
afraid of how the people she knew of who

298
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.569
were philosophers, let that get in the way of

299
00:17:45.579 --> 00:17:47.869
their actions. But there, there's no question that she

300
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.420
both used philosophy and that she thought philosophically.

301
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.310
But then when it comes to abolitionism, uh how

302
00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:00.599
influential was she back then in terms of this

303
00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:01.290
movement.

304
00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:05.579
She was very influential, she was very well known.

305
00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:10.060
Um Lots of people wrote to her throughout her

306
00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:12.510
life to tell her that she had changed their

307
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.180
minds and changed their lives. Some of what she

308
00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:20.859
wrote about slavery sold very, very well. Um She

309
00:18:20.869 --> 00:18:23.660
never took money for it, which is part of

310
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.540
why she remained impoverished, but I'll give you one

311
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.380
example. So this is much later in 1859. Um

312
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:39.010
AFTER John Brown's failed insurrection against slavery in um

313
00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:44.530
in Virginia, she wrote to the governor of Virginia

314
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.219
asking to come and nurse John Brown who was

315
00:18:48.229 --> 00:18:52.939
then in prison, the governor of Virginia. So she

316
00:18:52.949 --> 00:18:55.439
was famous enough that the governor of Virginia wrote

317
00:18:55.449 --> 00:18:58.630
back and said, you know, uh yes, you can

318
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.900
come and visit him. But he took some time

319
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:05.250
to um scold her right to say that John

320
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.819
Brown's violent raid was the fault of people like

321
00:19:08.829 --> 00:19:11.959
her who had been, you know, saying such extreme

322
00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:15.459
things about slavery um that people like John Brown

323
00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:19.699
became violent about it. He then published her letter

324
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:23.709
without her permission and his letter um reprimanding her

325
00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:27.380
in the press. This gave her the opportunity to

326
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.849
write back in the press. Um AND it was

327
00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:34.300
this, you know, 57 page I forget um just

328
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:40.310
destruction of his terrible arguments again that caused another

329
00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:43.520
woman to in in the South to write this

330
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.079
very angry reply to child and publish that in

331
00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:49.900
the newspapers and then that gave child an opportunity

332
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.239
to publish again an even longer rebuttal. I mean,

333
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.119
these are just, she was a master of rhetoric.

334
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.790
Um, AND these people, I don't think they quite

335
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.939
knew what they were getting into when they sort

336
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:05.089
of baited her into responding. And then that so

337
00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:07.910
all of those letters together were then published as

338
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.469
a pamphlet which sold 300,000 copies, which is an

339
00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:16.550
incredible number for um the population of the United

340
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.219
States at that time. But I think it was

341
00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:23.310
the 19th century equivalent of going viral. Um And

342
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.270
when she died, people were very clear that she

343
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.824
had in many cases each a part of the

344
00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:34.415
population that some of the other um major abolitionist

345
00:20:34.425 --> 00:20:37.614
speakers were unable to reach. So I think during

346
00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:40.614
her lifetime, she was considered very, very influential

347
00:20:41.055 --> 00:20:43.555
by the way, when did she die? Exactly. Did

348
00:20:43.564 --> 00:20:46.234
she leave? At least to see, for example, the

349
00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:48.114
end of the Civil War or

350
00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:51.594
no, she did. So she died in 1880. Um

351
00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:55.505
So she, yeah, the civil war ended in 1865.

352
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.060
So, yes, she, she saw the end of the

353
00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:05.709
war, she saw emancipation. Um She was surprisingly uh

354
00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:11.770
non triumphant about that. Um IN part because she

355
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.010
was so saddened and discouraged by the fact that

356
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.770
it took a war to end slavery. And she

357
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.540
was convinced correctly as it turned out that unless

358
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:28.050
slavery ended because white Americans actually change their hearts

359
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.489
and minds as opposed to being forced to give

360
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.609
up slavery um through violence that um slavery would

361
00:21:35.619 --> 00:21:39.689
just reassert itself in another form which it very

362
00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:43.219
quickly in the South um around things like black

363
00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:47.709
codes and then later uh Jim Crow laws. And

364
00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:51.050
there, there are many parts of slavery that survive

365
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.180
in the mass incarceration system in the United States

366
00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:57.130
now. Uh NOT to mention just the survival of

367
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.880
racism. So, and she really, she lived long enough

368
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.250
to watch Reconstruction, which was the attempt to rebuild

369
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.290
the South with a more just racial uh framework

370
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.760
to see that fail. So she, I think died

371
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:17.760
very discouraged about the future of um racial justice

372
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.939
in the United States. And I should say that

373
00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:23.500
the fact that she was interested in racial justice

374
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.849
and racial equality rather than just the end of

375
00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:30.160
slavery also really made her a radical. So there

376
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.920
were lots of northerners who thought that slavery should

377
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.979
end, you know, were sort of slowly convinced that

378
00:22:36.989 --> 00:22:40.000
it should end. But that did not mean that

379
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.040
they thought that Africans and their descendants were the

380
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.170
equals of whites. So they, they maybe thought they

381
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.819
shouldn't be enslaved. Exactly. But they definitely did not

382
00:22:49.829 --> 00:22:54.239
want them in schools, in churches, in theaters. They

383
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.390
didn't, in most cases, didn't want them to be

384
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.910
able to vote, right. So, so the end of

385
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.790
slavery did not mean anything like the beginning of

386
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.819
racial equality, even for most people in the north

387
00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:08.819
and so child from a very early point was

388
00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:11.540
wanted, both. She wanted the end of slavery and

389
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.339
she wanted racial equality. Um And when she died,

390
00:23:15.349 --> 00:23:17.170
it was still very clear to her that, that

391
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.755
was a long way away in the United States

392
00:23:20.084 --> 00:23:20.805
still is.

393
00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:24.614
And she was right, because black people in America

394
00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:28.084
had to fight for equal rights, at least for

395
00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:30.194
the next, the next 100 years.

396
00:23:30.204 --> 00:23:32.104
Right. Yes, that's right. And, and many of those

397
00:23:32.114 --> 00:23:34.564
fights are still not over and in many cases,

398
00:23:34.574 --> 00:23:36.665
things are getting worse rather than better as far

399
00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:37.875
as racial equality goes.

400
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.310
So, uh something that she also was, was a

401
00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:46.910
women's rights activist, right? So, what would you like

402
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.819
to tell us about that? What were some of

403
00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:52.329
her main ideas and contributions in that domain?

404
00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:55.390
Yeah, I think this is a really interesting part

405
00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:02.420
of her um, trajectory. She was much slower to

406
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.859
embrace gender equality as we now call it uh

407
00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:09.239
than she was to embrace racial equality. So she,

408
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.050
I, I think that was in part because as

409
00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.050
she herself said, she was much more comfortable fighting

410
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.260
for the rights of other people than for her

411
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.630
own. So she would say things like I don't,

412
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.160
I would rather never talk about women's rights. I

413
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.670
would rather just go out and do what I

414
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.969
want to do. And, you know, if people don't

415
00:24:28.979 --> 00:24:31.270
want me to do it, then I will fight

416
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.839
with them. But not until then. And I think

417
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:37.540
at the beginning, she also sort of took the

418
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.790
line that women had their own sphere and it

419
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.609
was better for them not to get involved in,

420
00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:49.410
in some parts of society in the 18 thirties.

421
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.729
She got very mixed up in a huge scandal

422
00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:58.170
and schism in the abolitionist movement when some men.

423
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.890
Well, what happened was it was started by people

424
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.560
like William Lloyd Garrison who were radical in many

425
00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:08.400
ways including Garrison believed in gender equality or equality

426
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.849
of the sexes. But then as the movement grew

427
00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:17.290
and more conservative men wanted to join, they were

428
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.089
very uncomfortable with the fact that Garrison had quote

429
00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:24.810
unquote, allowed women to join. And more to the

430
00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:28.250
point that women abolitionists were speaking in public, which

431
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.319
was still essentially forbidden. Child herself never spoke in

432
00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:34.089
public as far as I know she didn't like

433
00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:36.979
doing it. She didn't want to do it but

434
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:42.689
sh but she wanted her female collaborators like Abby

435
00:25:42.699 --> 00:25:47.569
Kelly or the Grimke sisters or Maria Weston Chapman,

436
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.380
um to be allowed to speak if they wanted

437
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.800
to. And so when the more conservative men started

438
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.250
to say things like we will join this movement,

439
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.569
but only if the women stop speaking and essentially

440
00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:03.660
go home, then she fought back um and wrote

441
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:08.609
incredibly eloquent things about um not just the equality

442
00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:10.859
of men and women, but about what it means

443
00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:15.689
to allow individuals to do what their consciences dictate.

444
00:26:16.089 --> 00:26:19.380
So her, her main point of argument against men

445
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.540
at that point was more, don't you dare get

446
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.209
in the way of my doing what I feel

447
00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:29.449
called to do morally speaking. Um And you know,

448
00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:32.040
gender is like, not even, doesn't even have to

449
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.949
be part of that unless you, the more conservative

450
00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:37.619
men make it a part of that. So, so

451
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.810
her sense was that the, the fight about women's

452
00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:43.079
involvement in the abolitionist movement was really the fault

453
00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:45.550
of men. So sometimes men would say, well, please

454
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.550
just don't bring up the women question that's distracting.

455
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.790
And she would say I didn't bring it up,

456
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.160
you brought it up, right? We were just doing

457
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.920
what we thought we should be doing and then

458
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.949
suddenly we're told we shouldn't. And then as is

459
00:26:57.959 --> 00:27:03.060
so typical in the history of philosophy, women have

460
00:27:03.069 --> 00:27:06.739
to stop doing what they wanted to do. In

461
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.619
many cases, philosophies and fight for their right to

462
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:14.119
do that first, which means that they have much

463
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.380
less time to develop their philosophies or just to

464
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.780
do. And it just becomes an enormous distraction that

465
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.800
the men don't have to deal with. So this,

466
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.270
this is a classic problem anyway. Um So later

467
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.550
in her life after the war was over, she

468
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.010
did get very involved in the um fight for

469
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.829
women's suffrage for the right to vote. Um She

470
00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:40.709
was older at that point, she didn't, she wasn't

471
00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:43.319
as involved as she had been in abolition, but

472
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.260
she did write a very powerful series of articles

473
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.790
in the Independent. Um Again, it is a very

474
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.150
philosophical way just destroying all of the arguments that

475
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.880
people were making to keep women from voting. Um

476
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.609
So that, that there's also amazing philosophical thinking going

477
00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:07.400
on there. I'll mention one other thing that was

478
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.599
very painful for her around this topic, which was

479
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:15.209
that um your, your listeners and viewers might know

480
00:28:15.219 --> 00:28:18.140
that in the United States after the war, the

481
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:24.459
13th amendment ended slavery, but n no Africans or

482
00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:28.819
their descendants could vote yet on the federal level.

483
00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:30.560
Like there was no federal guarantee of that. It

484
00:28:30.569 --> 00:28:34.979
varied by state. But um when the 15th amendment

485
00:28:34.989 --> 00:28:38.160
was proposed to allow black men the right to

486
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:43.040
vote. Some feminists like Elizabeth Katie Stanton and Susan

487
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.089
B. Anthony started to oppose it because it was

488
00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:50.369
going to keep women from voting. So the language

489
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.449
of the 15th amendment ended up introducing the idea

490
00:28:53.459 --> 00:28:55.250
that only men could vote with that. That hadn't

491
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.079
been in the constitution previously. Um So for child,

492
00:28:59.089 --> 00:29:02.079
that was so painful to watch the women's movement

493
00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:06.790
then splinter between those who oppose the 15th amendment

494
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.479
because it was bad for women and those who

495
00:29:09.489 --> 00:29:12.439
said it is bad for women, but black men

496
00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:16.010
desperately need the right to vote if Reconstruction is

497
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.280
going to continue in the South. So we should

498
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.680
support it anyway. Child was definitely in the latter

499
00:29:21.689 --> 00:29:24.260
camp. So she you know, she said she wished

500
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:28.750
that the 15th amendment didn't specify men. Um, BUT

501
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.670
she supported it, um, for the sake of black

502
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.880
male voters. Um, BUT that, this is another example

503
00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:39.060
of how the, the quote unquote woman question, um,

504
00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:42.180
became a real issue for people who were trying

505
00:29:42.189 --> 00:29:44.979
to fight for racial justice, um, as well.

506
00:29:45.449 --> 00:29:48.469
Mhm. No. Yeah. I mean, in the history of

507
00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:53.959
universal suffrage there's always this trend of first, uh,

508
00:29:53.969 --> 00:29:58.160
we introduce vote, uh, the voting rights to, I

509
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.680
mean, in certain places, people who own land themselves,

510
00:30:01.689 --> 00:30:05.079
which, uh, were men for the most part. But

511
00:30:05.089 --> 00:30:08.392
then we expand to the best of the males,

512
00:30:08.402 --> 00:30:11.772
but perhaps not the blacks and then perhaps also

513
00:30:11.782 --> 00:30:14.853
the blacks and then perhaps also women. So, I

514
00:30:14.863 --> 00:30:18.902
mean, it's always tiny steps but that's almost, uh,

515
00:30:18.922 --> 00:30:23.682
it, it's the same, almost everywhere across the world.

516
00:30:23.692 --> 00:30:27.706
So it's not a problem that was specific to

517
00:30:27.715 --> 00:30:32.836
the United States, unfortunately. So, but, uh, we were

518
00:30:32.845 --> 00:30:37.286
talking about abolitionism and women's rights. Uh, IN her

519
00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:41.985
work in, uh Lydia, child's work did her ideas

520
00:30:41.995 --> 00:30:45.735
on abolitionism intersect in any way with her ideas

521
00:30:45.745 --> 00:30:48.166
on women's rights or not.

522
00:30:48.595 --> 00:30:50.406
Yeah, I think they did. And so far as

523
00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:54.765
she, she did believe in a kind of, um,

524
00:30:54.776 --> 00:31:04.880
universal justice that would, um, come to include everyone.

525
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.010
So there, there's a real sense in her work.

526
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.930
I think that people are basically good. They're, they're

527
00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:17.140
e, they're equal for sure. As individuals. Um And

528
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.209
they're also basically good and what keeps us from

529
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.390
being good to each other are bad arguments that

530
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.689
we, you know, hear and then repeat as excuses

531
00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:32.180
not to be the kind of um people that

532
00:31:32.189 --> 00:31:37.949
we should be. So I think she sometimes abolitionists

533
00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:40.130
of this period are accused of being kind of

534
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.449
one issue fanatics and she really wasn't. And, and

535
00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:46.869
that's not fair to say about many of them

536
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.609
too. But she really thought that in order to

537
00:31:49.619 --> 00:31:53.130
address these problems of inequality and prejudice more generally,

538
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.250
you had to articulate something more broad truth about

539
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.400
love in some cases. Uh So that was something

540
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.260
that she talked about from Swedenborg as well. That

541
00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:07.089
is a kind of universal force of love that

542
00:32:07.099 --> 00:32:10.119
unites us and makes us equal that um if

543
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.650
we again let these bad, got these bad arguments

544
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.810
out of the way we would be more able

545
00:32:14.819 --> 00:32:19.640
to um let that shine through as it were.

546
00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:21.709
So, yeah, I think for her, it was not

547
00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:23.290
a matter of, you know, this issue and then

548
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:28.630
that issue but trying to reorient people around um

549
00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.300
a more universal understanding of humans as equal and

550
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:38.369
love as a greater force that would then solve

551
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.469
many of these problems as opposed to one after

552
00:32:41.479 --> 00:32:42.189
the other.

553
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.510
Mhm. So, and because also, unfortunately in the US,

554
00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.869
there's never been a lack of oppressed peoples. Uh

555
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.010
What about the native Americans? Did she also write

556
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.189
on their right on them and their rights or

557
00:32:58.199 --> 00:32:58.469
not.

558
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.599
Yeah. In fact, this was the first cause that

559
00:33:02.609 --> 00:33:06.089
she felt very passionately about. So as I mentioned,

560
00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:09.030
her first novel had to do with um a

561
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.574
native American warrior, marrying a European settler novel ends

562
00:33:15.584 --> 00:33:19.435
um with it's very complicated. But um but with

563
00:33:19.444 --> 00:33:23.314
that Native American warrior giving up his right as

564
00:33:23.324 --> 00:33:26.724
it were to this woman and ceding it to

565
00:33:26.734 --> 00:33:29.234
a European who had a prior claim on her

566
00:33:29.589 --> 00:33:33.609
and then just kind of disappearing into the forest

567
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:38.939
literally. And for c this was very radical at

568
00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:43.290
this time because most people around child would have

569
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:48.469
been arguing that the only way to for European

570
00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:52.560
settlers to be victorious, which was clearly the point

571
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.689
was to exterminate the indigenous population. And she was

572
00:33:57.699 --> 00:33:59.829
trying to make the argument through this novel that

573
00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:03.910
they, that force wasn't necessary, that violence wasn't necessary

574
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.560
that because at that point, she still believed um

575
00:34:07.569 --> 00:34:12.188
that European civilization was superior, that Native Americans would

576
00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:15.929
just sort of fade away and it didn't require

577
00:34:15.938 --> 00:34:18.719
killing them. So this is not much better right

578
00:34:18.728 --> 00:34:22.520
to say that um don't worry, they will just

579
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:27.168
sort of voluntarily cede their position. She really came

580
00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.679
to reject that fairly early on in part because

581
00:34:30.688 --> 00:34:33.909
the man that she married um David Lee child

582
00:34:33.918 --> 00:34:37.850
was a, a staunch defender of Native American rights,

583
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.978
including the rights of Native Americans to defend themselves

584
00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.719
with violence if necessary. And it was necessary um

585
00:34:45.728 --> 00:34:50.139
against European settlers. So she wrote fairly early on

586
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:56.310
a scathing book about uh European atrocities against indigenous

587
00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.629
Americans. And again, it's just one thing after another.

588
00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:03.419
Um HOW hypocritical this is how cruel this is.

589
00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:06.909
And these people call themselves Christians and they claim

590
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.750
to be followers of Jesus. And how, you know,

591
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.639
how can they sleep at night? Essentially is the

592
00:35:12.649 --> 00:35:15.830
the undertone. So that, that was really one of

593
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:19.260
her earliest moral convictions that what was happening to

594
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.629
the native population in the United States was an

595
00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:25.979
atrocity. Um A genocide. She didn't use that word.

596
00:35:25.989 --> 00:35:33.010
Um But, and a terrible stain on the conscience

597
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.530
of the country. And then after the civil war,

598
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.939
she returned to that theme and wrote um a

599
00:35:39.959 --> 00:35:43.020
very powerful piece. Um IT'S called Appeal for the

600
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.719
Indians, which is not a word that we use

601
00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:49.489
to describe indigenous people anymore. But it's, it's very

602
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.790
similar to the appeal that she wrote in favor

603
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.989
of that class of Americans called Africans. Um In

604
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.419
that it, it again, it is, it, it may

605
00:35:58.439 --> 00:36:01.870
tears down all kinds of bad arguments, articulates this

606
00:36:01.879 --> 00:36:07.229
philosophy of um integrity. If Americans want actually to

607
00:36:07.239 --> 00:36:11.389
claim to embrace these ideals of justice and equality,

608
00:36:11.479 --> 00:36:14.629
they cannot continue behaving this way if they do.

609
00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:18.550
Um YOU know that they're being hypocritical and, and

610
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.189
delusional and in many cases, not they know exactly

611
00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:24.280
what they're doing. But I, I will say one

612
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.550
other thing that I tend to think about a

613
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.189
lot when I think about that piece is that

614
00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:32.379
she still had and and this was true sometimes

615
00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:35.570
of her interactions with Black Americans as well. This

616
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.879
kind of assumption that eventually these cultures would assimilate

617
00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:45.979
to European culture. She was very clear that European

618
00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:50.120
culture was deeply flawed and that in many ways

619
00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:55.840
delusional about its superiority. But she nevertheless continued often

620
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.250
as did many people to make arguments like native

621
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.459
Americans are like our younger siblings. They just haven't

622
00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:08.179
grown up yet. And once they are exposed to

623
00:37:08.189 --> 00:37:13.739
our um culture, they will be like us. Now

624
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.620
again, that was radically progressive for her time because

625
00:37:17.629 --> 00:37:20.959
many people were saying that Native Americans were not

626
00:37:20.969 --> 00:37:24.229
capable of that and just were, you know, violent

627
00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:29.530
and savage and needed to be um exterminated. Uh

628
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.760
And she completely rejected that. But on the other

629
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:38.040
hand, um did suggest that part of the kind

630
00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.179
of progress of history was going to be the

631
00:37:40.189 --> 00:37:43.949
assimilation of native people to European culture. I should

632
00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:45.530
say that one of the points that she makes

633
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.219
over and over again is the hypocrisy of calling

634
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.120
native Americans. In this case, um savages or barbarous

635
00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:59.520
when what was happening was that European settlers were

636
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:06.139
acting with horrendous violence and barbarism against them. So,

637
00:38:06.209 --> 00:38:11.659
so she's very clear that European culture as then

638
00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:16.149
absorbed by uh Americans um was the violent one

639
00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.340
and the one that needed to be called out

640
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.780
for its savage behavior but nevertheless, I think she

641
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.459
held out this kind of ideal that, you know,

642
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:29.260
European culture, if we actually followed it as opposed

643
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.219
to not following it by engaging in these atrocities.

644
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:35.899
Um WAS the one and I mean, in her

645
00:38:35.909 --> 00:38:37.840
mind, the one that had articulated the kinds of

646
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:42.959
truths about equality and justice that she wanted people

647
00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:46.419
to follow again, a naive position in many ways,

648
00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:48.520
but, but progressive for its time.

649
00:38:49.209 --> 00:38:52.429
So just earlier, I asked you if you saw

650
00:38:52.439 --> 00:38:56.750
any intersections between her work on abolitionism and her

651
00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.850
work on women's rights more broadly. Do you see

652
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:06.510
common threads across all of her uh intellectual, nonfictional

653
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.870
work on the rights of all of these different

654
00:39:09.879 --> 00:39:14.060
kinds of people like the Black Americans, the native,

655
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.629
the native Americans and women?

656
00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:21.629
Yeah, I think so. Again, generally the claim that

657
00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:26.510
all humans are have a kind of equality in

658
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.790
so far as we're, there's a kind of conscience

659
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.389
sense even about dignity and the inviolability of the

660
00:39:33.399 --> 00:39:39.659
person. And then the sense that that humans, once

661
00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:43.100
they have power are very good at making up

662
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:48.149
arguments to deny that. And in so far as

663
00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:50.969
she has a more pessimistic view of human nature,

664
00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:52.530
I think that would be it. So, on the

665
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.989
one hand, all humans have this potential for um

666
00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:02.860
for great achievement and, and love for each other,

667
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:08.010
but we're very distractible by bad arguments and that

668
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.030
always if there are these parts of the population

669
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.360
whether it be women or Native Americans or Black

670
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:17.479
Americans who can be described by those in power

671
00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:21.879
in false and derogatory ways. It's always going to

672
00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:24.850
be in the interest of the powerful to promote

673
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.090
those stories in a way to keep them in

674
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.510
power. Um So I think that sort of those,

675
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.290
those different strands between beliefs about human nature on

676
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.810
the good hand, on the one hand and uh

677
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.600
not on the other would be another sort of

678
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.459
basic philosophical commitment. I think.

679
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:47.520
So, how would you classify Lydia Mariah child as

680
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.840
an intellectual? Because earlier, if I remember correctly, at

681
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.070
a certain point, you said that she herself didn't

682
00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:57.389
refer to herself or talk about herself as a

683
00:40:57.399 --> 00:41:01.580
philosopher. And you also mentioned that she had some

684
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:07.719
criticisms of common or traditional intellectuals. Uh So, uh

685
00:41:07.729 --> 00:41:11.389
I mean, in your mind, how would you classify

686
00:41:11.399 --> 00:41:13.020
her as an intellectual?

687
00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:17.370
Yeah, I, I think of her as someone who

688
00:41:17.379 --> 00:41:23.090
thought philosophically who, but who was primarily interested in

689
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.330
philosophical thinking in order to decide how to live

690
00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:31.360
and in a way that is how Western philosophy

691
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.810
got started, right? That is what Socrates said that,

692
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.360
you know, we the unexamined life is not worth

693
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.929
living and the point of philosophy is to be

694
00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:46.159
better people. And I think philosophy often gets so

695
00:41:46.169 --> 00:41:49.479
distracted from that, right? And the, the, the more

696
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.189
abstract and intellectual it becomes the more disengaged from

697
00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:56.409
those real questions about how thought can help us

698
00:41:56.419 --> 00:42:00.370
live better lives and we just lose sight of

699
00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:03.939
that. So this is a, an ongoing question whenever

700
00:42:03.949 --> 00:42:05.889
you try to deal with women in the 19th

701
00:42:05.899 --> 00:42:08.969
century who are thinking philosophically. And I'm, I'm actually

702
00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:12.189
editing a volume of about women um in the

703
00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:16.179
United States and the, and Great Britain um who

704
00:42:16.189 --> 00:42:20.129
were either philosophers or thought philosophically in the 19th

705
00:42:20.139 --> 00:42:23.520
century. And I mean, it, it, it becomes a

706
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.639
kind of self defeating question in a way if

707
00:42:26.649 --> 00:42:29.560
you're always trying to decide, well, were they philosophers

708
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.399
or were they not philosophers? They, they weren't allowed

709
00:42:32.409 --> 00:42:36.139
to be philosophers? They weren't allowed to get university

710
00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:40.120
degrees until very late in the century. So that's

711
00:42:40.129 --> 00:42:43.800
the wrong question um That, that people sometimes ask.

712
00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.729
Um But I also think that for, for the

713
00:42:46.739 --> 00:42:48.830
sorts of reasons we talked about a, a while

714
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:55.330
ago, often women couldn't just think philosophically abstract, aly,

715
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.159
abstractly without first making the argument that they were

716
00:42:59.169 --> 00:43:01.919
allowed to. And so then they had to engage

717
00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:04.679
in what we might call social philosophy or social

718
00:43:04.689 --> 00:43:08.050
activism, which then gives people more of an excuse

719
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.969
to dismiss them, right? And say, well, that's not

720
00:43:09.979 --> 00:43:15.570
really philosophy, that's social theory or that's activism. Um

721
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.899
So part of what I and and others who

722
00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:19.719
are working in this field are, are really trying

723
00:43:19.729 --> 00:43:21.959
to do is push back against that. In part

724
00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:25.010
by showing that in the 19th century, it was

725
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.310
much more common for people to think of philosophy

726
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.610
in those terms. So the the abstract ratified Ivory

727
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.810
Tower kind of philosophy has not always been the

728
00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.949
way philosophy has been understood. And so for, if

729
00:43:39.959 --> 00:43:43.729
we're constantly judging people in the past by that

730
00:43:43.739 --> 00:43:48.219
standard, that's not historically accurate. And it's also not

731
00:43:48.229 --> 00:43:51.780
just, and I think that, you know, for me,

732
00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:55.719
I love doing abstract philosophy, as I say, I,

733
00:43:55.729 --> 00:43:58.500
I loved writing on Hagel. Um I hope to

734
00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.199
continue doing it. It's also, and, and Hagel has

735
00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:05.739
like such a deep and wide and brilliant and

736
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.939
ingenious system in which so much, there's so much

737
00:44:09.949 --> 00:44:14.550
richness and so much um potential for this glorious

738
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.320
thought. It's also true that he got some very

739
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:24.800
basic moral things, very wrong, right? So anything about

740
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:29.439
gender, anything about race, he tends to get terribly

741
00:44:29.449 --> 00:44:32.479
wrong. So on the one hand, we can think

742
00:44:32.489 --> 00:44:38.620
about people like Hegel as paradigmatic philosophers. I wanna

743
00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:42.600
be sure that we don't therefore ignore the fact

744
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.949
that it's important to pay attention to people who

745
00:44:44.959 --> 00:44:48.800
are getting the moral questions, right? Even if they

746
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:55.060
don't have the big historical system, philosophical systems. And

747
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:57.840
again, back to an early point, maybe even because

748
00:44:57.915 --> 00:45:00.274
of that, right? You know, the child is not

749
00:45:00.284 --> 00:45:03.475
engaging in this kind of big system building and

750
00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:05.695
in a way that's a reflection of her clear

751
00:45:05.705 --> 00:45:09.604
moral compass. So this is a very long um

752
00:45:09.614 --> 00:45:12.294
answer to your question, how I would characterize her

753
00:45:12.304 --> 00:45:14.905
as an intellectual you know, I'd say she's someone

754
00:45:14.915 --> 00:45:18.915
who, who was a social activist in a way

755
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:23.639
that was founded in philosophical thinking. And that used

756
00:45:23.649 --> 00:45:28.090
philosophy in the, in a classic original Socratic sense,

757
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:31.479
both to try to help other people see the

758
00:45:31.489 --> 00:45:35.229
errors in their thoughts and also to live a

759
00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:39.649
worthwhile life that reflects the kinds of values that

760
00:45:39.659 --> 00:45:42.969
we profess to have. Um So she might be

761
00:45:42.979 --> 00:45:46.439
unclassifiable in that um in that way. But that's,

762
00:45:46.449 --> 00:45:48.239
those are the terms in which I, I think

763
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:48.600
of her.

764
00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:53.370
And as far as we could identify her as

765
00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:56.689
a philosopher, what questions do we think that she

766
00:45:56.699 --> 00:45:59.449
forces us to ask ourselves?

767
00:46:00.169 --> 00:46:02.179
I, I think so many of them have to

768
00:46:02.189 --> 00:46:06.580
do with integrity and hypocrisy. And so what are

769
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:10.379
our values? And are we living up to them?

770
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.219
So, in what ways do we allow ourselves to

771
00:46:14.229 --> 00:46:18.120
be distracted by bad arguments from the kinds of

772
00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:20.560
things that we know we should be paying more

773
00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.389
attention to or the sorts of things that we

774
00:46:22.399 --> 00:46:25.949
know are wrong? Um, I mean, I think she,

775
00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:28.909
again, she's so good at appealing to our better

776
00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:31.510
natures in a way that is, can be really

777
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:37.159
inspiring. And also to just to ask us to

778
00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:40.870
think whenever, whenever we feel convicted that something's wrong

779
00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:43.889
and then get sort of distracted by thinking, well,

780
00:46:43.899 --> 00:46:46.820
maybe we can't do anything about it or maybe

781
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:49.010
it's not as bad as it looks or we

782
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.909
find some argument that makes us feel less guilty.

783
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.949
Um That, that is something that we need to

784
00:46:53.959 --> 00:46:58.489
be careful about. Um, AND more honest with ourselves

785
00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.209
about

786
00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:04.010
and specifically, do you think that ship reps puts

787
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.120
into perspective, what the role of intellectual should be?

788
00:47:08.129 --> 00:47:12.610
Particularly you yourself, you are an academic and sometimes

789
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.899
academics get very mad, get annoyed by, I don't

790
00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:19.949
know, political activists and they don't like for people

791
00:47:19.959 --> 00:47:23.600
to try to uh moralize what they're doing or

792
00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.875
to try to push them into politics, political activism,

793
00:47:27.885 --> 00:47:32.314
moral questions or moral considerations that might derive from

794
00:47:32.324 --> 00:47:34.965
the kind of work they're doing it, they try

795
00:47:34.975 --> 00:47:38.774
to reduce everything into the pursuit of truth with

796
00:47:38.784 --> 00:47:41.294
a capital t or something like that and be

797
00:47:41.304 --> 00:47:44.895
very abstract. So do you think that perhaps uh

798
00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:48.254
Lydia Child would also put that a little bit

799
00:47:48.264 --> 00:47:50.004
into perspective or not?

800
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.600
Yeah, definitely. Um And you know, I don't want

801
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:57.429
to cast aspersions on, on anyone but, but she's

802
00:47:57.439 --> 00:48:00.590
definitely changed the way I think of myself in

803
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.969
the world and think of myself as an academic.

804
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.739
Um She's the kind of person, once you've read

805
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.580
enough of her, it's very hard to live your

806
00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.939
life the same way again. And I, I think

807
00:48:09.949 --> 00:48:13.979
it's important to be open to the concern that

808
00:48:13.989 --> 00:48:16.439
some of us who think we are living good

809
00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:20.379
lives um are actually contributing to the problems that

810
00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:23.080
we say we want to address in really fundamental

811
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.760
ways. So I've tried very hard to reorient myself

812
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.429
in, in lots of ways, the way I teach

813
00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:31.080
what I teach, what I write, how I write,

814
00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:34.860
how I spend my money. I'm, I'm still absolutely

815
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.439
nothing like the kind of activist she was, I

816
00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:43.520
don't flatter myself, um, that I uh do that.

817
00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.679
But I, you know, I think especially that we're

818
00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:50.590
facing multiple crises in our world um from environmental

819
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.899
to political. Um And I think academics need to

820
00:48:55.909 --> 00:48:59.479
be very careful about thinking about the value of

821
00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:01.399
what we do. I'm not saying that abstract thought

822
00:49:01.409 --> 00:49:03.810
doesn't have any value, but I do think that

823
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.320
someone like child can help us worry about that

824
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:13.679
more and try to uh use the intellectual tools

825
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:16.360
that we have actually to try to make a

826
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.199
better world. And again, I, I understand that there

827
00:49:18.209 --> 00:49:20.260
will be people who say that's not my job

828
00:49:20.929 --> 00:49:22.939
to which I would say well, OK, but let's

829
00:49:22.949 --> 00:49:25.860
be clear about that. Um And maybe let me

830
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.379
one other way of putting this is that one

831
00:49:28.389 --> 00:49:31.580
thing I really admire about child. She was very

832
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.449
good at looking at what her skills and talents

833
00:49:35.459 --> 00:49:39.219
and gifts were and then applying those in a

834
00:49:39.229 --> 00:49:42.669
way that would have real effects. So she knew

835
00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:45.239
she was a good writer. She knew that she

836
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.520
was very good at um convincing people of things.

837
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.199
She was good at practice and, and she used

838
00:49:51.209 --> 00:49:55.239
those things in the service of um the causes

839
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:57.760
that she knew were the important causes of her

840
00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:01.000
day. And I think even people who don't think

841
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.719
of engaged philosophy as their job can still do

842
00:50:04.729 --> 00:50:07.510
things like that. So part of what I think

843
00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.219
she shows us is that everyone has ways in

844
00:50:10.229 --> 00:50:13.120
which they can engage more fully. Um And that

845
00:50:13.129 --> 00:50:15.979
we especially as academics need to be careful not

846
00:50:15.989 --> 00:50:19.459
to hide too much behind some sort of belief

847
00:50:19.469 --> 00:50:21.860
that what we do is so important or so

848
00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:27.360
impressive that, uh, the real world isn't our concern.

849
00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:30.899
And also, of course, in this question, just to

850
00:50:30.909 --> 00:50:33.330
be clear, I was not trying to imply that

851
00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:37.209
there's not, and there's an, there's not anything at

852
00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:41.679
all, uh, about the idea that perhaps we should

853
00:50:41.689 --> 00:50:46.899
keep, uh, morals and politics out of intellectual pursuits

854
00:50:46.909 --> 00:50:49.639
because I, I mean, there's something to that. It's

855
00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:51.800
just that I think that perhaps it's a bit

856
00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:56.840
naive for some academics to perhaps think that what

857
00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:00.570
they're doing is not at all, uh, moral or

858
00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.479
political or doesn't have any sort of those kinds

859
00:51:04.489 --> 00:51:08.899
of, uh, implications because it has and also that

860
00:51:08.909 --> 00:51:13.090
it is completely, or talkers in the space that

861
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:20.040
is completely outside of the cultural, political, economic, moral

862
00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:22.879
context where they live in. Right.

863
00:51:22.919 --> 00:51:25.419
Yes. No, that's very well put. Yeah, I think

864
00:51:25.429 --> 00:51:27.879
those, those are all things that we always need

865
00:51:27.889 --> 00:51:30.389
to be thinking about, but in the current moment,

866
00:51:30.399 --> 00:51:32.179
probably more than ever.

867
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.219
Yeah. So let me just ask you one last

868
00:51:35.229 --> 00:51:38.350
question then. So you wrote of course, an entire

869
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.530
book on Lydia Mariah Child. So what would you

870
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.879
say are perhaps some of her traits or some

871
00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:49.830
of her intellectual achievements that you admire the most

872
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.790
about her? I I mean, actually, is it the

873
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:58.895
intellectual achievements her, her writings, is it some of

874
00:51:58.906 --> 00:52:03.325
her own personal traits or is it even also

875
00:52:03.335 --> 00:52:05.726
because she was a wo a woman in the

876
00:52:05.736 --> 00:52:09.406
19th century? And we all know that even nowadays,

877
00:52:09.416 --> 00:52:11.956
but even more so in the 19th century, uh,

878
00:52:11.966 --> 00:52:15.885
woman intellectual, I mean, it was a very hard

879
00:52:15.895 --> 00:52:17.756
thing to pull through, I

880
00:52:17.766 --> 00:52:23.741
guess. Yeah, all of those things for sure. Um

881
00:52:23.751 --> 00:52:25.291
You know, that, as I've been saying, like the

882
00:52:25.302 --> 00:52:29.981
power of her thought, the consistency of her thought

883
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:33.882
over decades. So when she converted to abolitionism in

884
00:52:33.892 --> 00:52:37.461
the 18 thirties, I think a lot of abolitionists

885
00:52:37.471 --> 00:52:40.791
thought that this would go pretty quickly that it,

886
00:52:40.802 --> 00:52:44.112
once they made this very strong moral argument to

887
00:52:44.122 --> 00:52:46.909
the American public, the American public would think. Oh,

888
00:52:46.919 --> 00:52:49.179
wait, you're right. This is terrible. We have to

889
00:52:49.189 --> 00:52:53.000
stop this. Um, BUT instead it took 30 years

890
00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:56.610
and, you know, 750,000 deaths in the civil, like,

891
00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.639
just, just an incredible amount of blood um, and

892
00:52:59.649 --> 00:53:02.919
violence to, to end it. But, but she, she,

893
00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:05.840
she remained committed all the way through to the

894
00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.000
end of her life. I, I really admire that.

895
00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:12.830
I also really admire that. She never thought of

896
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.899
herself as too good to be practically engaged. And

897
00:53:16.909 --> 00:53:19.969
I think this um is connected to your last

898
00:53:19.979 --> 00:53:22.000
question as well. So I haven't even talked about

899
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:26.100
all of the ways in which she actually sometimes

900
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:30.520
physically put her self in this struggle. So she

901
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.260
would sometimes go to um speeches that were being

902
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.739
given by abolitionist speakers at which there were mobs

903
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.459
that attacked them and she would put herself between

904
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:45.739
the speaker and the mob assuming correctly that the

905
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.570
mob was less likely to attack a woman. So

906
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.780
she, she would, she would be physically engaged. She

907
00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:55.129
and her husband moved to the middle of Massachusetts

908
00:53:55.139 --> 00:53:59.600
to try farming sugar beets at one point in

909
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.979
an attempt to undermine the plantation, sugarcane trade. So

910
00:54:04.989 --> 00:54:07.459
that was another example in which she like completely

911
00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:10.439
changed where she lived and what she was doing

912
00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:14.219
thought in a very thought economically and agriculturally instead

913
00:54:14.229 --> 00:54:18.360
of philosophically or in addition to philosophically. And also

914
00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:22.239
she was very clear in her engagement with Black

915
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:26.659
Americans um and in trying to support them and

916
00:54:26.669 --> 00:54:29.689
make sure that their voices were heard um in

917
00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:33.679
some cases helping them financially or she did help

918
00:54:33.689 --> 00:54:36.760
people on the underground railroad. So, so she was

919
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:42.370
also willing really to engage on a more practical,

920
00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:45.419
less intellectual level. She also during the civil war

921
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:51.120
and sewed for soldiers and raised money for fugitives

922
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:54.260
from slavery. I mean, she, she was always thinking

923
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.520
what she could do to help actual people as

924
00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:00.979
well as articulating in, in more abstract ways, the

925
00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:03.719
kinds of arguments that she also thought were necessary.

926
00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.959
So it's a kind of um again engaged philosophy

927
00:55:06.969 --> 00:55:10.110
and how do I put my thoughts into action

928
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.379
um that, yeah, I I really admire about her.

929
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.780
Great. So the book is again, Lydia Mariah Child,

930
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.020
a radical American life. Of course, I'm leaving a

931
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:22.110
link to it in the description of the interview

932
00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.510
and also a link to our first interview here

933
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.989
on the channel, Doctor Moland. And apart from that,

934
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.270
would you like to tell people again where they

935
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.790
can find you and your work on the internet?

936
00:55:34.629 --> 00:55:37.659
Yes, thank you. So, um I my website is

937
00:55:37.669 --> 00:55:42.719
Lydia moen.com. Um I am on X and Threads

938
00:55:42.729 --> 00:55:46.649
um Occasionally anyway, um the book, as you mentioned

939
00:55:46.659 --> 00:55:49.080
is out in paperback very soon and there is

940
00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:52.570
also now an audio book that's on audible and,

941
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.919
and many other places where people get their audio

942
00:55:54.929 --> 00:55:58.600
books. So I think um this is going to

943
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.600
be another time where it'll be really interesting to

944
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.060
engage in, in her thought and I would love

945
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.860
to hear people's thoughts about her if they read

946
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:06.300
the book.

947
00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:10.340
Great. So, thank you so much again for coming

948
00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:12.719
