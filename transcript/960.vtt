00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.890
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.809
Decent. I'm your host as always, Ricard Loops. And

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.109
today I'm joined by Grace Blakely, author, journalist, political

4
00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.069
commentator. And we're talking about her latest book, Vulture

5
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.870
Capitalism, corporate Crimes backdoor bailouts and the Death of

6
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.809
Freedom. So, Grace, welcome to the show. It's a

7
00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.129
huge pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.549
Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.200
So the first thing I would like to get

10
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.879
into when it comes to your book is that

11
00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:36.040
uh one thing is how capitalism actually works. And

12
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:40.099
another thing is what people commonly think. I mean,

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.740
what are their common ideas about how it works?

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.419
So, before we get into some of the examples

15
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.979
you explore in the book to illustrate how capitalism

16
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.689
works and some of the tactics that capitalists have

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.389
to sort of exploit the system or make the

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.459
system work in their favor. Uh What would you

19
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.799
say? Or perhaps some of the most common ideas

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.839
that people have about or what they think cap

21
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:10.190
uh how they think capitalism works.

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.300
Yeah. So I suppose I wanted to write this

23
00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.580
book to address some of those misconceptions about how

24
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:21.629
capitalism works. Um And I think the first and

25
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.980
most prominent one is this idea that um capitalism

26
00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:28.690
is like a free market system. Um And a

27
00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:32.980
system in which um the, the state is completely

28
00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:36.269
separate from the market. So you have this idea

29
00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:39.589
that in capitalist societies, you have economies that are

30
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.940
governed by the principles of free market economics. And

31
00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:45.370
then you have governments that exist separate to those

32
00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:49.099
economies that kind of regulate the free market. Um

33
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.949
And the idea is that if the government gets

34
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.269
too big relative to the economy, then that becomes

35
00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.550
socialism effectively. So this idea that capitalism is, is

36
00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:02.489
a free market economy and socialism is a big

37
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.910
state deciding everything. Um And I think those misconceptions

38
00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:08.220
come back to the legacy of the Cold War,

39
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.419
basically when you had uh the US, which painted

40
00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.020
itself as this kind of free market utopia. Um

41
00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.949
And the US sr where you did have a

42
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.529
centrally planned economy where the state uh kind of

43
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:24.520
determined the production and allocation of resources. Um So

44
00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.130
I wanted to kind of really respond to that

45
00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.369
uh that misconception that a lot of people have.

46
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.300
Um And I did that by looking both at

47
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.809
whether or not capitalism is a free market system

48
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.570
and also the role of the state within capitalist

49
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.929
economies. Um So in the book, I show that,

50
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.369
you know, capitalism isn't a free market system. Um

51
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.009
And that the state actually has a very significant

52
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.662
role in determining what goes on in capitalist economies.

53
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:57.222
And the example I use is uh to start,

54
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:59.942
the book is Boeing. So, uh some of your

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.082
readers, uh some of your listeners, sorry, might remember

56
00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:07.492
the Boeing 737 max disasters which took place um

57
00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:11.641
in about 2018, 2019. Uh AND in those disasters,

58
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.302
two Boeing planes fell out of the sky killing

59
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.274
nearly 350 people in two separate plane crashes. Um

60
00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:21.393
And there were lots of investigations that went on

61
00:03:21.404 --> 00:03:24.994
into why this had happened. It ultimately transpired that

62
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.964
senior executives at Boeing had known about the problems

63
00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:33.613
with this plane before uh the crashes took place.

64
00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:35.893
Um, AND had done nothing about it despite the

65
00:03:35.904 --> 00:03:38.063
fact that there had been whistleblowers coming forward, there

66
00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:40.333
had been people within the firm saying this plane

67
00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:43.434
is unsafe, we cannot bring it to market. But

68
00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:45.936
the senior executives and this company said, nope, we're

69
00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:51.305
gonna do that anyway. Um And to understand how

70
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.686
this this disaster and this kind of, you know,

71
00:03:53.695 --> 00:03:56.216
corruption of what was once a kind of great

72
00:03:56.225 --> 00:04:00.406
American firm took place. You have to understand firstly,

73
00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:03.966
that Boeing wasn't operating in a free market context.

74
00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:09.005
And secondly, that it is deeply enmeshed with the

75
00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:13.350
American State. So firstly, Boeing doesn't operate in a

76
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.399
free market. It is um it operates in a,

77
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.858
a duopoly. So basically there are two large firms,

78
00:04:19.869 --> 00:04:23.980
Boeing and Airbus that dominate um the aviation industry.

79
00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.399
Uh THERE'S, you know, there is competition between those

80
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.000
two firms. Um BUT it is a very specific

81
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.339
type of competition. It's not the kind of competition

82
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.989
that you would expect within a free market system

83
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.454
where there's lots of small producers competing to produce

84
00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:40.695
things and the pressures of competition keep prices down.

85
00:04:40.954 --> 00:04:44.524
Um And you know, it's a maximally efficient system

86
00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:48.234
instead you have these two big firms. Um AND

87
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:52.214
they are competing to keep costs down as low

88
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.945
as possible. Um So that means kind of underpaying

89
00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:59.084
workers making sure unions don't get recognized, cutting corners

90
00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:02.750
in production as we saw with Boeing. Um AND

91
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.309
uh generally kind of stripping out as much cost

92
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.739
as possible to maximize their profits. It also means

93
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.720
that they pursue other avenues to try and consolidate

94
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.519
their market power. So, for example, um you know,

95
00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:21.279
getting favorable deals with governments um making deals with

96
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.679
airline carriers. Uh So Boeing had this deal with

97
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.079
Southwest airline provider um that uh basically kind of,

98
00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.920
you know, allowed it to uh maintain uh production

99
00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:37.790
and, and, and ensure demand was maintained. Um So

100
00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.429
you kind of have deal making that goes on

101
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.290
quite a lot within this context. Um And uh

102
00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:47.339
also this close relationship with the state. Um Now,

103
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.540
Boeing was one of the biggest recipients of corporate

104
00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.049
welfare in the US in 20. Uh I think

105
00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.730
it was 2018 and that has continued. So it

106
00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:59.010
receives massive subsidies, tax breaks huge amounts of support

107
00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:01.570
from the American State. It also has a lot

108
00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.920
of contracts with the US, states with different parts

109
00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:07.079
of the state, with, you know, the Pentagon Department

110
00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.899
of Defense, etcetera. Uh, AND so, um, the US

111
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.290
government has been very involved in the Boeing scandals

112
00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:19.630
since they've, since they've started, um, in the sense

113
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.559
that, you know, the regulator was really asleep at

114
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.320
the wheel during the 737 max disasters. Boeing was

115
00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:30.470
actually being regulated by, um, a unit of the

116
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.010
Federal Aviation Authority that sat inside Boeing and whose

117
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.420
workers were being paid by Boeing. So it was

118
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.279
effectively regulating itself. Um And it was receiving all

119
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.970
this money from the government even after the 737

120
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.329
max disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Um The US

121
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.029
state distributed a huge amount of money to Boeing.

122
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.940
Um, AFTER all of these scandals had come to

123
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.600
light, even after it had been charged with a

124
00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:59.709
criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States, it still

125
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.640
got all this money from the government. Um And

126
00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:04.369
so I think what this shows, you know, this

127
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.929
is the context in which the, the disasters took

128
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.290
place, right? It was um, a monopolistic market structure

129
00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:14.089
in which Boeing was operating where it had no

130
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.049
real discipline from the market, no accountability from regulating

131
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.820
because regulators were so close to it and no

132
00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:24.029
democratic accountability from the US state because, you know,

133
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.019
Boeing's lobbyists were working in all different areas of

134
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:31.380
the United States uh government um to get contracts

135
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.839
to change legislation, to change regulation. Uh And all

136
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.459
that means is that you have this massive powerful

137
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.690
firm that is effectively insulated from any accountability. It

138
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.309
doesn't have accountability from the market cos there's not

139
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.850
as much competition and it doesn't have accountability from

140
00:07:46.859 --> 00:07:50.000
the States. And it just means that basically the

141
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.440
senior executives of these really big firms are able

142
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.399
to kind of plan who gets what even though

143
00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:59.579
this is supposed to be a free market economy

144
00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:02.750
where nobody can plan anything because the market is

145
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.410
supposed to decide. Um So that I think in

146
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.140
another number of other examples, shows this lie that

147
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:11.950
capitalism means free markets. It doesn't, it means a

148
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:16.109
kind of uh it means basically massive corporate power.

149
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.200
Um THE power of large firms over the rest

150
00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:24.260
of society that isn't constrained by the market. And

151
00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:26.329
that isn't really constrained by the power of the

152
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.820
state as well. It's kind of this toxic fusion

153
00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:33.700
of public and private power in service of maximizing

154
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.979
the wealth and power of people at the top.

155
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.869
So let's talk more about it, that idea or

156
00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:43.609
that misconception that people have or that capitalists promote

157
00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:47.408
that we actually have a free market. I mean,

158
00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:50.318
whatever that means because for me, at least it's

159
00:08:50.328 --> 00:08:55.208
always been weird how, what, how with an actual

160
00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:59.388
free market would work without any state intervention, any

161
00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:03.289
state regulation, enforcement of contracts and all of that.

162
00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:05.588
But, but anyway, we can also get into that

163
00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:10.840
later. But um in what ways are businesses planned?

164
00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:12.690
And I think it's very important for us to

165
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.359
address that question here because uh since this is

166
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:20.799
a very common misconception, people actually tend to believe

167
00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:27.059
that businesses are not planned just because business owners

168
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.239
and other people like that. Say so,

169
00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:32.869
yeah. So to understand this argument that I have

170
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.280
about planning, we need to understand as you were

171
00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:39.119
saying, what a free market should look like, right?

172
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.440
And like if you pick up an economics textbook,

173
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.570
what are they going to tell you the free

174
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.250
market looks like? And the idea is that you

175
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:53.580
have um lots of similar producers all producing the

176
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.099
same commodity, let's say in a market for, I

177
00:09:57.109 --> 00:10:00.859
don't know, um like cars. So you've got lots

178
00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:04.710
of different producers, all producing their own cars. Um

179
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.590
AND they um are competing with each other on

180
00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:12.989
costs and on prices so that if one firm

181
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.719
produces cars less efficiently than another firm, there are

182
00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:20.229
loads of other car firms that produce cars more

183
00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:23.710
efficiently at a lower cost. So no consumers buy

184
00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:27.109
the car of this inefficient firm. And the pressures

185
00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.090
of competition mean that the inefficient firm goes out

186
00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:33.690
of business and only the efficient firms survive. Uh

187
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.239
And that is supposed to be how a free

188
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.090
market economy maximizes efficiency. It's the pressure of competition

189
00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:44.390
means that only the most efficient producers are able

190
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.270
to survive. Um BECAUSE the others out compete, uh

191
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.250
outcompete the less efficient ones. Um So anything that

192
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.719
kind of gets in the way of that competitive

193
00:10:55.729 --> 00:11:01.469
pressure undermines this kind of free market uh idea

194
00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:05.099
basically. Um And what we see in kind of

195
00:11:05.109 --> 00:11:09.500
modern capitalist economies is that it doesn't look like

196
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.890
that at all. So we don't have lots and

197
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.690
lots of little firms all competing to produce things.

198
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.119
You know, the only context in which that's really

199
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.450
true is if you look at like a local

200
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.039
market in your town there, you have little, you

201
00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:25.369
know, producers competing to produce things, right? That is

202
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.479
like a, a kind of free market. But if

203
00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:31.635
you look at production of the important commodities like

204
00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:36.025
cars, for example, um like airplanes, whatever, then you

205
00:11:36.034 --> 00:11:40.094
have a number of large and powerful producers um

206
00:11:40.104 --> 00:11:43.895
that are, that have very close links with governments.

207
00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:47.044
Um AND which are to a greater or lesser

208
00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:51.549
extent insulated from competition. Um So, you know, there

209
00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:54.169
are barriers to entry, which mean that new firms

210
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:58.570
struggle to come in. Um There are regulatory barriers.

211
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.700
Um There are cost pressures. Um And there are

212
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.289
these kind of these links between firms and states

213
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:11.309
that keep existing firms within the market. And mean

214
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.909
that even if you aren't the most efficient firm

215
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.669
in your sector, you can often survive anyway because

216
00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:22.190
you can ask the government for a bailout or

217
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.859
you can just buy up your competitors. For example,

218
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.140
if like a new competitor threatens you, you can

219
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.020
use all your cash to buy that firm and

220
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.190
integrate it into your firm, you have better access

221
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.409
to, to finance because you probably have a very

222
00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:37.340
close relationship with big banks. So the banks will

223
00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:39.840
be more likely to lend you money. Um And

224
00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:42.840
all of these things mean that you're kind of

225
00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:46.390
insulated from competition. Um So you don't have this

226
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.520
pressure of the market that is keeping firms um

227
00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:54.590
operate, operating at the most efficient level. Um And

228
00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:58.979
which is kind of making sure that um like

229
00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:02.619
competition continues to hold sway over, over the economy,

230
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.099
you just, you, you lose that and in its

231
00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:09.570
place, uh rather than having kind of competition, you

232
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.909
have a, a form of, of economic planning, basically

233
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.179
co in this competitive scenario, nobody can really plan

234
00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:20.179
like the leaders of all these little firms, they

235
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.630
can't plan, they can't um make long term decisions

236
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.760
because they don't know what the future of that

237
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.020
free market system is gonna look like. They don't

238
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.539
know what all of the other actors in that

239
00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:34.460
system, they don't know how they're gonna behave. Um

240
00:13:34.469 --> 00:13:39.270
And if they make a decision that goes against

241
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.890
the market, that kind of undermines um efficiency, for

242
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.090
example, then they'll go out of business. Like if,

243
00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:49.669
if a manager makes the wrong decision, let's say

244
00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.289
he starts producing cars in a way that's more

245
00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:55.030
expensive than his competitors, then his firm will go

246
00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.859
under. So he doesn't really have any power within

247
00:13:57.869 --> 00:14:00.729
that system. He's very much constrained by what the

248
00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:03.849
market says you should do. Whereas in the economy

249
00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:06.840
that we live, because you have all these barriers

250
00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.919
around firms that come from politics that come from

251
00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:12.840
finance that come from their relationship with other firms.

252
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.109
Um ECONOMIES of scale, all of these things. It

253
00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:18.250
means that the managers within those firms have a

254
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.599
lot of power to plan, even if they make

255
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:23.429
the wrong decision and they mess up, like for

256
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.969
example, they did at Boeing, the firm isn't going

257
00:14:25.979 --> 00:14:28.280
to collapse because it can rely on the fact

258
00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:31.280
that it's got friends in the government. Uh It

259
00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:33.150
can rely on its size, it can rely on

260
00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:37.960
its its relationship with financial institutions um to make

261
00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:42.239
sure that that firm stays alive even if everything

262
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.330
has kind of, even if its managers have have

263
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.960
made a series of really bad decisions. And so

264
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.229
that idea that the people at the top of

265
00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:51.830
the most powerful firms have the power to plan,

266
00:14:52.109 --> 00:14:54.109
kind of undermines this idea that we live in

267
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:58.309
a free market system. And it also um it

268
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.320
really kind of undermines this idea that we live

269
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.159
in a, in a true democracy, right? Because firstly,

270
00:15:07.119 --> 00:15:11.229
a huge amount of um decision making about the

271
00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:13.520
world in which we live takes place within firms.

272
00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:16.659
Now, in a free market scenario, it doesn't really

273
00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:19.030
matter because the market is, is telling everyone what

274
00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.940
to do, they don't have any power. But in

275
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.809
the, in the world that we live, these people

276
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.140
do have power, they're making decisions over what innovations

277
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.799
are taking place where investment is going. Um, YOU

278
00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:32.700
know, which country they're being located in the wages,

279
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.244
they're paying work. All of these questions are being

280
00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:38.385
decided by powerful people at the top of big

281
00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:41.625
firms without any accountability. So they don't have discipline

282
00:15:41.635 --> 00:15:44.905
for the market and they don't have democratic accountability

283
00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:47.875
because they also use their power to lobby governments

284
00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:50.304
to make sure that those governments do what they

285
00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:55.219
say. So instead, you have really big powerful firms

286
00:15:55.479 --> 00:15:58.570
that don't have market accountability, don't have democratic accountability

287
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.510
and are instead just planning our world based on

288
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.030
their own interests. You see this in the fossil

289
00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:07.239
fuel industry, for example, Exxonmobil is one of the

290
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.989
biggest um fossil fuel producers uh in the world.

291
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.525
Scientists are Exxonmobil knew about climate breakdown, knew about

292
00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:16.585
the impact that burning fossil fuels would have as

293
00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.655
far back as the 19 seventies. So instead of

294
00:16:19.664 --> 00:16:23.234
spreading the word about that, Exxonmobil took funding out

295
00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:26.575
of its climate research team and used that funding

296
00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:30.655
to uh spread climate denialism. So to say climate

297
00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:34.159
burning fossil fuels doesn't cause climate breakdown. Um And

298
00:16:34.169 --> 00:16:37.500
to lobby the US government, you know, Exxon's former

299
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.909
CEO eventually got a very senior position in the

300
00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:42.119
US government under Trump. So there was this really

301
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.130
close link between Exxon and the US State. And

302
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.669
now, you know, they're still, they were caught, but

303
00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.375
Exxon lobbyist was caught on camera talking to a

304
00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:56.854
Greenpeace reporter saying we're, we've won massive results um

305
00:16:56.864 --> 00:17:00.515
by lobbying various different governments. They were saying that

306
00:17:00.525 --> 00:17:03.215
they were lobbying for a carbon tax on the

307
00:17:03.224 --> 00:17:05.094
basis that they knew a carbon tax was never

308
00:17:05.104 --> 00:17:06.824
gonna happen. So it was a way of kind

309
00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:09.045
of undermining the fight against climate breakdown.

310
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.079
Sorry for interrupting you there. But I, I mean,

311
00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.000
actually it's not that we do not have several

312
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.790
different examples of that same sort of thing you're

313
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.689
describing there because of course, the biggest ones tend

314
00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:25.729
to come from the US. But another example would

315
00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:30.543
be all tobacco companies deal with what they, they

316
00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:34.734
already knew were the health consequences of smoking cigars,

317
00:17:34.744 --> 00:17:38.593
smoking tobacco cigarettes and all of that and they

318
00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:41.663
uh hid it from the public.

319
00:17:41.803 --> 00:17:45.979
Right. Yeah, exactly. And so, you know, that decision

320
00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:50.439
was taken by leading figures within the the tobacco

321
00:17:50.449 --> 00:17:54.979
industry to push smoking and everyone else has had

322
00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:57.849
to deal with the consequences of that decision. And

323
00:17:57.859 --> 00:18:00.219
there's been no accountability. There's been no way to

324
00:18:00.229 --> 00:18:02.979
say you took the wrong decision, we're holding you

325
00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:05.910
to account, right. You know, instead they were just

326
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.390
able to, they made billions and billions of dollars

327
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.400
of basically making people really ill. And it's the

328
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.750
same with, with climate breakdown. So basically this creates

329
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.319
this problem. We don't live in a free market

330
00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:19.829
economy. There's not enough democratic accountability. Um So how

331
00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:22.430
do we hold the powerful to account, how do

332
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:25.550
we start to take control over our economy and

333
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.619
over our society?

334
00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:30.160
Yeah. And we're going to get into that question

335
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.729
later on in our conversation. But let me just

336
00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:35.229
ask you because this is also uh a topic

337
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.439
that you explore in the book. And I'm personally

338
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:41.290
also very interested in when it comes to relations

339
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.729
between employers and employees, between capitalists and labor in

340
00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:49.989
the capitalist system and the history of labor, labor

341
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.116
movements. It seems, please correct me if I'm wrong.

342
00:18:53.126 --> 00:18:56.266
But it seems very obvious to me that particularly

343
00:18:56.276 --> 00:19:00.496
from the 19th century onwards, if it wasn't for

344
00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:08.567
workers organizing themselves, organizing collectives to strike protest and

345
00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:13.526
try to pressure capitalists and governments to create labor

346
00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:18.683
laws to increase minimum wages, to ameliorate working conditions,

347
00:19:18.693 --> 00:19:22.264
to get more benefits and stuff like that. That

348
00:19:22.274 --> 00:19:26.244
would have never happened alone. I mean, at least

349
00:19:26.293 --> 00:19:28.384
that's what it seems to me looking back in

350
00:19:28.394 --> 00:19:31.663
history and the, the common idea that we hear

351
00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:37.534
from many uh capitalists, from many people who economically

352
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:41.331
fall more on the liberal side of the spectrum

353
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:46.110
is that, oh, if the market was just more,

354
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.911
uh it was just freer, if we were able

355
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:52.270
to do things more freely, then it would just

356
00:19:52.281 --> 00:19:56.931
so happen eventually that workers would get higher wages,

357
00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:59.890
more benefits and all of that kind of good

358
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:02.020
stuff. But is that really true?

359
00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:07.750
Yeah. So this idea again, relies on uh the

360
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.750
world view that liberals have, which rests on this

361
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.880
idea of the free market. So it doesn't just

362
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.199
apply to consumers. It also applies to workers. You

363
00:20:15.209 --> 00:20:18.699
know, the idea is if one firm offers lower

364
00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:22.329
wages, bad conditions and another firm offers higher wages

365
00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:25.380
and better conditions, workers will leave this firm and

366
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.729
go to that firm. Um Now that kind of

367
00:20:29.739 --> 00:20:31.750
doesn't really account for a lot of different factors

368
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.650
like, you know, whether or not this firm is,

369
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.930
is hiring enough workers, whether or not there's enough

370
00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:38.609
jobs to go around, whether or not, you know

371
00:20:38.619 --> 00:20:41.400
what kind of employment contracts, uh These workers are

372
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.670
under um whether or not they're able to move

373
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.609
around the country, like around the world, all these

374
00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:49.560
different things, co workers have far less power. Uh

375
00:20:49.569 --> 00:20:52.170
But you know, this is allegedly how free markets

376
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.150
are supposed to work. The issue with the kind

377
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.760
of economy that we live in is that we

378
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.689
have not only monopoly power but also what's called

379
00:21:00.699 --> 00:21:04.119
monotony power. And that means when a firm is

380
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.160
not just the largest seller in the market, but

381
00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.939
it is by far the largest buyer in a

382
00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:11.900
market including a buyer of labor. So when one

383
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.469
firm dominates the labor market in a particular area,

384
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.290
it basically has the power to just set wages,

385
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.650
to just set conditions. Amazon for example, in certain

386
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.630
areas of the country employs, you know, nearly 50%

387
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.219
of workers in a particular small area. So all

388
00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:31.469
all the working conditions will be set by Amazon

389
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.630
in that area because basically it has such power

390
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.260
over the labor market. Um And that really undermines

391
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.699
this idea that, you know, you have this free

392
00:21:38.709 --> 00:21:40.640
market for labor where workers can kind of move

393
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.380
around. But the kind of deeper and more fundamental

394
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.300
issue here um is the question of the balance

395
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.569
of power within society. So I don't have this

396
00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:53.609
free market, liberal interpretation of the capitalist economy. I

397
00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:56.959
have a Marxist interpretation of the capitalist economy which

398
00:21:56.969 --> 00:21:58.900
means that rather than seeing it as a system

399
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.150
that's based on free markets and exchange and that

400
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.199
sort of thing, um I argue that capitalism is

401
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:07.709
a system based on the class division of society.

402
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.560
So Marx starts his argument by like looking at

403
00:22:11.569 --> 00:22:14.550
Adam Smith, David Ricardo, all of these theorists who

404
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.369
said capitalism is great because it creates, you know,

405
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.709
it's based on this free market system which, you

406
00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:23.430
know, maximizes efficiency. Um YOU know, creates wealth for

407
00:22:23.439 --> 00:22:26.739
everyone creates progress, et cetera. Uh BECAUSE they were

408
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.385
all studying exchange, they were studying what takes place

409
00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:33.326
within markets. Mark said it's not enough to study

410
00:22:33.336 --> 00:22:35.686
what takes place within the market. You have to

411
00:22:35.696 --> 00:22:38.475
look at how the commodities that are being sold

412
00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:41.576
in that market were produced. So you have to

413
00:22:41.586 --> 00:22:45.465
go back into the firm and look at what

414
00:22:45.475 --> 00:22:47.316
goes on within the firm, which is not something

415
00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:49.995
that the early political economists did. And so remarked

416
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:54.432
at the firm, he discovered this division of labor.

417
00:22:54.442 --> 00:22:58.112
So there's this division between owners who own all

418
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.001
of the means of production and workers who are

419
00:23:01.011 --> 00:23:04.041
forced to sell their labor power for a wage.

420
00:23:04.052 --> 00:23:06.442
And then a kind of strata of managers on

421
00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:09.261
top who are paid by the owners to kind

422
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:12.839
of manage the workforce. And this is like this

423
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:14.630
is the, the class division of society. It's the

424
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.719
social division of labor. Um AND it creates, it

425
00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.979
is based on an inherent balance, imbalance of power.

426
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.750
So there are a small number of people who,

427
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.650
for whatever reason, own everything, they own the land,

428
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.699
they own resources, they have, you know, political power

429
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.349
and they are able to use that to uh

430
00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:34.839
um you know, create businesses that other people are

431
00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:37.239
then forced to work in. Now, workers don't have

432
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.550
that power, they have to sell their labor power

433
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.189
in order to survive, right? Because, you know, we

434
00:23:43.199 --> 00:23:45.910
don't have service with agriculture anymore, whatever. Um So

435
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.060
they're, they're forced to work for these people who

436
00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:52.709
own, who own the means of production. And that

437
00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:55.729
imbalance is the basis of a capitalist society. It's

438
00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:58.630
what makes capitalism work. If you didn't have some

439
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.890
people who had all the power and other people

440
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.119
who could be forced to work, then you wouldn't

441
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.560
get commodity production and you wouldn't get exchange. Um

442
00:24:06.569 --> 00:24:08.900
You know, that that system would not have emerged

443
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.219
in the same way. So this imbalance of power

444
00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:14.630
sits at the heart of capitalist societies. It's the

445
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.189
source of exploitation. So capitalists profits come from the

446
00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:21.079
fact that they pay workers the same as the

447
00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:23.880
value of the goods that they produce, that's exploitation.

448
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.359
Um AND the kind of oppression of workers. So,

449
00:24:27.369 --> 00:24:29.540
you know, keeping them in their place, dividing workers

450
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.189
into different kind of categories, dividing them geographically so

451
00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:35.569
that some workers in very poor countries can be

452
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:38.000
paid very little, whereas other workers can be paid

453
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.589
slightly more. Um YOU know, all of these strategies

454
00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:42.619
are designed to kind of exploit and oppress workers,

455
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.530
keep them down, stop them from organizing to like

456
00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.569
um kind of even out that, that imbalance of

457
00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:53.380
power, this imbalance of power basically is like the

458
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.030
foundation of capitalism. It has to be that some

459
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.359
people are in control and some people are oppressed

460
00:24:59.369 --> 00:25:02.369
and excluded. So when workers start to come together

461
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.849
and organize in trade unions, you know, organized politically

462
00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:09.689
and political parties as they do in the kind

463
00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:12.180
of late 18 hundreds and uh and early 19

464
00:25:12.189 --> 00:25:16.089
hundreds, that becomes a real threat to the development

465
00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.910
of capitalism because suddenly, you know, you have workers

466
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.300
who can say we want higher wages, we want

467
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.760
better conditions or we're going on strike and you

468
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.510
won't have any labor to produce the commodities that

469
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.619
you're selling for a profit. Um So when this

470
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.800
starts to happen, this is, uh you know, around

471
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.260
the time that, that Marx is writing as well.

472
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:42.900
Um He realizes that this, you know, organizing, worker

473
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.020
organizing is this massive threat to the social division

474
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.329
of labor because when workers have real power, they're

475
00:25:50.339 --> 00:25:53.859
able to really kind of make demands of, of

476
00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:57.219
capitalists. And ultimately, he argues, if they get enough

477
00:25:57.229 --> 00:26:00.170
power, workers will be able to take control of

478
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.819
the production process and just do it themselves, right?

479
00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:05.770
And this is what I look at in the

480
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.089
book is um this question of do workers need

481
00:26:09.099 --> 00:26:11.849
to be managed and controlled because it's like a

482
00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:14.829
key part of capitalist ideology to say that workers

483
00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:19.880
are stupid, kind of um irrational, like lazy, they

484
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.199
need someone telling them what to do. And actually

485
00:26:22.209 --> 00:26:25.349
there's lots of examples of workers kind of organizing

486
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:29.319
themselves and managing themselves and doing so better than

487
00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:32.349
the people who have been managing them before. So

488
00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:35.510
this idea that you can move from this society

489
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.589
based on just a really sharp imbalance of power.

490
00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:41.390
So some people up here with all the power,

491
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.589
all the wealth, some people down here forced to

492
00:26:44.599 --> 00:26:47.439
just do as they're told through to a democratic

493
00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:51.180
egalitarian system where power is shared, where decisions are

494
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.930
made collectively, where production is um undertaken by workers

495
00:26:56.939 --> 00:27:01.439
working together. That's the kind of socialist argument really.

496
00:27:01.449 --> 00:27:04.699
And it all rests on workers being able to

497
00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:09.130
organize themselves and take that power back from the

498
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.510
people at the top of the economy.

499
00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:16.219
So before we get into how workers have and

500
00:27:16.229 --> 00:27:19.349
can organize themselves, uh let me just ask you

501
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:22.420
about this because it's another thing that really bothers

502
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.140
me a lot when I hear it on the

503
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.900
news and then when I hear politicians saying that

504
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:30.939
whenever there is an economic crisis and in 2008,

505
00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.609
for example, we heard a lot of that, we

506
00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:38.400
constantly hear uh politicians and business owners and people

507
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.439
like that saying on the media, for example, how

508
00:27:41.449 --> 00:27:45.859
common citizens should be more mindful about, they spend

509
00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:48.579
about the ways who spend their money, how public

510
00:27:48.589 --> 00:27:52.089
spending should be cut, how we uh how we

511
00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:56.689
are spending too much on state subsidies, state support

512
00:27:56.699 --> 00:28:01.150
for the more most vulnerable people and stuff like

513
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.310
that. But doesn't that happen for businesses and companies?

514
00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:11.319
I mean, don't they get public subsidies, state support

515
00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:14.739
and sometimes they also get bailouts has happened a

516
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.319
lot in the 2008 financial crisis actually. So, I

517
00:28:19.329 --> 00:28:21.089
mean, this isn't that a thing?

518
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.069
Yes, it was a really big thing. And um

519
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:30.540
it really undermines the argument that is made by

520
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.459
free market, neo liberal economists and policymakers. They say

521
00:28:36.469 --> 00:28:39.859
they say that they want free markets and a

522
00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:43.420
small state, right? Um So they want less state

523
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.300
spending and they want greater competition, all of these

524
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.760
sorts of things. Um BECAUSE that is supposed to

525
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.760
be a good thing that maximizes efficiency. It, you

526
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.689
know, makes everyone more wealthy. It spurs innovation, et

527
00:28:56.699 --> 00:28:58.939
cetera. They have these great arguments for free market

528
00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:02.459
systems that also rely on this idea that free

529
00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:05.239
markets make us all free because we're free to

530
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.329
choose what we consume where we work, et cetera.

531
00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:11.060
Now, there's problems with that argument in itself, but

532
00:29:11.069 --> 00:29:13.689
the biggest issue is that, that is not how

533
00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:17.550
capitalism works. It's like a, a veil, that argument

534
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.709
is designed to obscure what's really happening. So neoliberals

535
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:25.250
will use this argument. We want free markets, but

536
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.579
when they get power, they will undermine the free

537
00:29:28.589 --> 00:29:32.859
market when it comes to subsidies for big businesses,

538
00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:37.074
bailouts for banks bailouts for large corporations, you know,

539
00:29:37.084 --> 00:29:41.045
tax cuts for large corporations. Um THEY'LL, you know,

540
00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:43.844
undermine regulation for big businesses. So they'll create a

541
00:29:43.854 --> 00:29:49.844
very uncompetitive market or almost corrupt environment. A lot

542
00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:54.444
of the time for big businesses that often fund

543
00:29:54.454 --> 00:29:57.464
these, these politicians, right? So the free market doesn't

544
00:29:57.474 --> 00:30:00.045
apply to those at the top, but they'll impose

545
00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:05.020
very, very rigidly, these free market principles on those

546
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.449
at the bottom. So they will cut state spending

547
00:30:07.459 --> 00:30:12.089
on healthcare and social security um on public services.

548
00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:15.630
They'll often raise taxes on um the less well

549
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.430
off they will um you know, uh undermine union

550
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:24.920
organizing, they impose anti union legislation, all of this

551
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:29.689
stuff aimed at imposing very, very rigorous competition on

552
00:30:29.699 --> 00:30:33.729
workers and removing state support for workers whilst undermining

553
00:30:33.739 --> 00:30:37.119
competition and increasing state support for big businesses and

554
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:41.719
financial institutions. Now, from a free market perspective, that

555
00:30:41.729 --> 00:30:46.119
doesn't really make sense. It's like incomprehensible. Um It,

556
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.800
it means like competition for some people and no

557
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.119
competition for others. But when you understand the the

558
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.359
economy from a Marxist perspective, which is about who

559
00:30:55.369 --> 00:30:58.949
has the power, right? And it's actually capitalists and

560
00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:01.645
bosses, you have a huge amount of power over

561
00:31:01.655 --> 00:31:03.864
our society and over our politics, it makes a

562
00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:07.104
lot more sense because what the capitalists have done

563
00:31:07.114 --> 00:31:12.395
is effectively um manipulated the government to make sure

564
00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:14.864
that they get all the support and that workers

565
00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:17.699
don't get any support. Now, this is kind of

566
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.829
always how things have worked, right? Like, you know,

567
00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:21.199
this is how things have worked from since the

568
00:31:21.209 --> 00:31:23.979
origins of capitalism. The issue is that today we

569
00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:28.189
have this ideology that says, you know, the government

570
00:31:28.199 --> 00:31:33.150
is just um promoting efficiency, it's just enforcing competition.

571
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.510
Um It's just, you know, making sure that we

572
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.829
don't spend too much money, right? So people believe

573
00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:41.839
that the government is acting in everyone's interests when

574
00:31:41.849 --> 00:31:45.459
actually it's generally acting in the interests of those

575
00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:46.310
at the very top.

576
00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:50.709
So let me ask you now, because the things

577
00:31:50.719 --> 00:31:54.199
we've been talking about here are mostly about what

578
00:31:54.209 --> 00:32:00.099
happens m mostly within societies, within countries. But in

579
00:32:00.109 --> 00:32:02.969
the book, you also talk a little bit about

580
00:32:02.989 --> 00:32:07.614
how countries from the global North continue to exploit

581
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:11.074
in different ways. Countries from the global South and

582
00:32:11.084 --> 00:32:16.555
their respective populations even after the supposed end of

583
00:32:16.564 --> 00:32:19.015
colonialism. So, could you tell us a little bit

584
00:32:19.025 --> 00:32:19.594
about that?

585
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:24.130
Yeah. So empire and imperialism is a really important

586
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.650
part of how the system works. Um And the,

587
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.449
the kind of starting point for that um is

588
00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:36.579
the fact that like large powerful businesses and the

589
00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:40.400
people who own them are concentrated in rich countries,

590
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.280
whereas the workforce now is concentrated in poor countries.

591
00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:47.319
So you'll often hear people saying Marxist analysis doesn't

592
00:32:47.329 --> 00:32:51.530
apply anymore because most people in say England or

593
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.119
Europe or the US are middle class. So they're

594
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.260
not workers, they're not bosses, they're kind of middle

595
00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:03.199
class managers or, you know, professional managerial workers, right?

596
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.420
What this argument misses is that this class divide

597
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.939
still works. It just works at the level of

598
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:12.969
the global economy. So when you look at the

599
00:33:12.979 --> 00:33:17.119
global economy, it's very, very divided between a very,

600
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.439
very tiny class of people who own everything, who

601
00:33:20.449 --> 00:33:22.800
own the businesses, who own the land, um who

602
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.020
kind of, you know, distribute all the money, then

603
00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.579
a slightly larger but still very small class of

604
00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:33.099
professional managers, accountants, lawyers, uh you know, finances, you

605
00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:37.180
know, a managerial class who manage the production process

606
00:33:37.189 --> 00:33:40.380
on behalf of those people at the very top

607
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.069
and then a massive class of workers and those

608
00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:48.545
workers are generally located in very very poor countries.

609
00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:52.334
And are still paid very low wages, still face

610
00:33:52.344 --> 00:33:56.895
really horrendous conditions when they're producing things. Um And,

611
00:33:56.905 --> 00:34:00.175
you know, are not well off and don't have

612
00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:04.295
very many prospects. So this divide between workers and

613
00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:07.875
bosses, it exists within, within all societies, but it's

614
00:34:07.885 --> 00:34:11.949
clearest at the level of the global economy. Um

615
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:15.560
And the way that this is enforced is basically

616
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:20.179
rich companies are located in the US, the UK,

617
00:34:20.188 --> 00:34:22.889
you know, all around Europe, they list on stock

618
00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:26.978
markets in those countries. They lobby the governments of

619
00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.649
those countries. They rely on banks that are located

620
00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:33.239
in those countries. So owners are concentrated in the

621
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.620
global north, whereas workers are concentrated in the global

622
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:43.260
south. Um And to an extent, those powerful companies

623
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.110
have like bought off the governments in the rich

624
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:53.800
countries and concentrate slightly higher paying jobs in those

625
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:57.540
countries so that workers don't rebel. So in the

626
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.590
US UK Europe, um there are lots of kind

627
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.219
of managerial jobs that are all about managing a

628
00:35:03.229 --> 00:35:07.485
global production process that pay slightly better and mean

629
00:35:07.495 --> 00:35:10.284
that those relatively more powerful workers who live in

630
00:35:10.294 --> 00:35:14.245
democracies who, you know, have like a significant amount

631
00:35:14.254 --> 00:35:18.475
of power production process, they're paid slightly better wages.

632
00:35:18.909 --> 00:35:21.899
Whereas the people who are doing the most kind

633
00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:25.620
of dirty, horrible low paid jobs are less powerful,

634
00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:30.479
have lower wages, but also are under authoritarian regimes.

635
00:35:30.489 --> 00:35:33.050
They don't have many rights. They kind of struggle

636
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.010
to organize because they're often kind of you know,

637
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.870
beaten down and, and, and prevented from doing that

638
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.709
and they're not able to move. So this is

639
00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:44.739
the thing, there's a big wage gap between the

640
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:48.020
global north and the global south. But because borders

641
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.260
are so rigidly policed, poor workers can't move to

642
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.429
rich countries, but businesses can move everywhere. So rich,

643
00:35:56.439 --> 00:36:01.370
powerful businesses can produce all their commodities with low

644
00:36:01.379 --> 00:36:04.209
paid workers in the global South, then sell those

645
00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:09.260
commodities to relatively better paid consumers in the global

646
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.270
North. But the two can't move around, this capitalist

647
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.719
can move around everywhere, then they can offshore the

648
00:36:15.729 --> 00:36:18.540
profits to a tax haven somewhere. So they don't

649
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.760
have to pay any tax and generally kind of,

650
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.820
you know, make use of the fact that capital

651
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.100
can move all around the world. But labor is,

652
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.649
is stuck. That's the kind of foundation of imperialism.

653
00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:33.020
It's like the, the global division of labor, basically

654
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.429
the international division of labor. Um AND the way

655
00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:37.770
it's enforced. But what I look at in the

656
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.899
book is how this system is, is policed and

657
00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:45.169
enforced by international institutions and by very powerful governments.

658
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.239
And this is, you know, really interesting because we

659
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.070
think that we have this kind of liberal rules

660
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.000
based international system that's governed by international law. Um

661
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.189
That's about kind of promoting the free market and

662
00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:59.399
all that sort of stuff when actually we have

663
00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:03.270
a highly unequal global economy in which international institutions

664
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.540
are used to kind of beat down poor countries

665
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.760
and enrich powerful countries. And an example of this

666
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:15.199
I have is um the case of uh a

667
00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.229
um a vulture fund um that brought up the

668
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:22.449
debt of the government of Zambia in the like

669
00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:25.469
just after the financial crisis. So the Zambian economy

670
00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:29.050
was really struggling. Um THE revenues for the government

671
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.020
were falling and it was obvious that Zambia was

672
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:35.439
gonna default on its debts. So this Irish fund

673
00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:39.659
bought Zambian debt knowing that the country was going

674
00:37:39.669 --> 00:37:42.580
to default. And when the country did default, they

675
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:47.290
sued the Zambian government. So basically took money out

676
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.850
of the one of the poorest countries in the

677
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.010
world to pay these powerful investors. And this is

678
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.889
a tool that's used to keep poor countries poor

679
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.760
and in rich countries in rich, rich countries at

680
00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.060
their expense. And there's loads of other examples I

681
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.030
look at in the book that show that the

682
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.669
international in, you know, the international rules based system

683
00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:08.409
is all about maintaining that divide between the rich

684
00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.429
world and the poor world.

685
00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:13.110
So just before we get into the last part

686
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.870
of our conversation here today, and I ask you

687
00:38:15.879 --> 00:38:20.239
in what ways can people fight back against or

688
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.620
perhaps try to change the system in the ways

689
00:38:23.629 --> 00:38:26.199
that are possible uh that people can do it.

690
00:38:26.209 --> 00:38:29.169
And uh perhaps you can also give us a

691
00:38:29.179 --> 00:38:33.239
few examples of how people can collectively organize and

692
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.340
stuff like that. What do you mean by freedom

693
00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.530
in the book also to contrast with, uh to

694
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:45.879
contrast it with uh what capitalists usually mean by

695
00:38:45.889 --> 00:38:46.600
freedom.

696
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.399
Yeah. So I think, you know, those on the

697
00:38:49.409 --> 00:38:53.590
right have this pretty individualistic view of freedom. Uh

698
00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.310
And the idea is that you're free if there's

699
00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.600
not very much kind of standing in your way.

700
00:38:59.899 --> 00:39:03.350
Um So, uh you know, if you are able

701
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.169
to work wherever you want, if you're able to

702
00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:07.830
consume what you want to buy the products that

703
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.570
you want, um to kind of have, you know,

704
00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.959
free, free speech and all those sorts of things.

705
00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:16.270
Um And that individualistic view of freedom has some

706
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.620
merit, but it's very limited because it allows you

707
00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:23.939
to make decisions within your life. But it doesn't

708
00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:26.739
allow you to have an influence over the structure

709
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.219
of society. So, you know, you can choose what

710
00:39:29.229 --> 00:39:32.459
products you consume, but you can't choose, you know,

711
00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:35.870
what products are on the shelves or how much

712
00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:38.370
carbon has been used in producing those products, the

713
00:39:38.379 --> 00:39:40.979
working conditions of the people who have been producing

714
00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:43.469
those products, you're faced with a bunch of different

715
00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:46.662
products made by all these huge multinational corporations that

716
00:39:46.672 --> 00:39:50.812
have little democratic or competitive accountability and you're just

717
00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:53.781
presented with an option. And actually today, most of

718
00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.741
the products that you see on your shelves when

719
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:58.092
you go to the supermarket say they're all produced

720
00:39:58.102 --> 00:40:00.181
by like five different companies. So you don't even

721
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:02.241
have that kind of very limited view of freedom.

722
00:40:02.632 --> 00:40:04.981
But that's like the view of freedom that they

723
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:06.701
have on the right. And that it's supposed to

724
00:40:06.711 --> 00:40:08.491
underpin this idea that we need a free market

725
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:11.543
economy. I argue the kind of the Marxist view

726
00:40:11.553 --> 00:40:13.763
of freedom is much more expansive than that. So

727
00:40:13.773 --> 00:40:16.144
it's like, yes, you have freedom and autonomy within

728
00:40:16.154 --> 00:40:18.743
your life, you are free to make decisions, but

729
00:40:18.753 --> 00:40:23.083
you also have freedom over the structure of society.

730
00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:26.263
So you have the freedom as a worker to

731
00:40:26.273 --> 00:40:29.354
shape the decisions that are being made by the

732
00:40:29.364 --> 00:40:32.053
firm within which you work. So, you know, you

733
00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:36.785
have democratic control over the economy basically. Um AS

734
00:40:36.795 --> 00:40:40.246
a citizen, you have real democracy. So not, not

735
00:40:40.256 --> 00:40:42.895
the kind of like semi democracy that we have

736
00:40:42.906 --> 00:40:44.785
here where you have, you know, you vote once

737
00:40:44.795 --> 00:40:47.885
every four or five years. Um But you don't

738
00:40:47.895 --> 00:40:49.645
get to choose the candidates, you don't get to

739
00:40:49.656 --> 00:40:52.946
choose the policy agenda, you struggle actually to kind

740
00:40:52.956 --> 00:40:54.976
of hold politicians to account once they get into

741
00:40:54.986 --> 00:40:59.206
office and you actually aren't able to influence democratically

742
00:40:59.216 --> 00:41:01.986
large areas of what goes on in the state.

743
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.870
So there's real democracy politically and there's also crucially

744
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.830
democratic control over where you live and over your

745
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.070
community. Um So, you know, you have control over

746
00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.280
how your local municipal budget is spent. Um YOU

747
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.070
have control over kind of community institutions, you're like

748
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.219
engaged in what goes on in, in like your

749
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:25.060
place basically and all of these things require just

750
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.149
a massive transformation of the way society works. It

751
00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:32.469
requires decentralization of power. It requires a transformation of

752
00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:36.439
political parties, a demo democratization of the state and

753
00:41:36.449 --> 00:41:40.179
crucially a democratization of the economy. So giving people

754
00:41:40.189 --> 00:41:45.810
power and ownership over the economy basically. Um And

755
00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.090
what all this is supposed to do is shift

756
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.110
the balance of power in favor of workers. So

757
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.979
take power away from capitalists and give it to

758
00:41:52.989 --> 00:41:55.139
workers. And the only way to do that because

759
00:41:55.149 --> 00:41:57.709
they're not gonna give power away willingly, the government

760
00:41:57.719 --> 00:42:00.419
isn't gonna take power away from them because politicians

761
00:42:00.429 --> 00:42:03.264
are in the pockets of big corporations, workers have

762
00:42:03.274 --> 00:42:06.495
to organize. Citizens have to organize, everyone has to

763
00:42:06.504 --> 00:42:09.955
organize, you know, get into a union organize to

764
00:42:09.965 --> 00:42:12.645
like, you know, in your community even get out

765
00:42:12.655 --> 00:42:15.385
onto the streets and, and you know, take part

766
00:42:15.395 --> 00:42:17.814
in protest movements. There are lots of different ways

767
00:42:17.824 --> 00:42:20.469
that you can organize, but basically people have to

768
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:24.479
come together to demonstrate their power. Um And you

769
00:42:24.489 --> 00:42:25.919
know, what I like to say is that we

770
00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:27.530
should be living in a, in an economy in

771
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.639
a country where politicians are as scared of the

772
00:42:30.649 --> 00:42:32.719
people, voting for them as they are of the

773
00:42:32.729 --> 00:42:34.350
people who are giving them money.

774
00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.239
So tell us then about ways that you think

775
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:43.659
people can organize themselves in this context to try

776
00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:48.840
to take back control over planning and democratize certain

777
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.320
institutions and perhaps even businesses themselves.

778
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.169
Yeah. So the first and most important thing uh

779
00:42:56.179 --> 00:42:59.979
is to recognize that we live in highly individualistic

780
00:42:59.989 --> 00:43:04.469
societies. Now, this is the big difference since Marx

781
00:43:04.479 --> 00:43:07.340
was writing. Um YOU know, in Marx's time, uh

782
00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.245
people were still kind of quite community oriented, they

783
00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.114
were kind of other oriented. You had to co-operate

784
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.705
in order to survive with other people within your

785
00:43:16.715 --> 00:43:18.965
community, with other people within your workplace. So it

786
00:43:18.975 --> 00:43:20.945
was kind of easier to convince people join a

787
00:43:20.955 --> 00:43:24.665
union, you know, join a political movement, like really

788
00:43:24.675 --> 00:43:27.465
kind of take part in what's going on. The

789
00:43:27.475 --> 00:43:31.320
biggest triumph of neoliberalism has been to convince us

790
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.939
that we are these isolated, atomized individuals who can't

791
00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:39.149
trust each other, can't work with each other. We

792
00:43:39.159 --> 00:43:41.919
have to be governed by someone else because we

793
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:46.959
can't co-operate. Um And what this does is it,

794
00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:49.949
it kind of breaks us up and it makes

795
00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:53.179
us less powerful and it makes us feel powerless

796
00:43:53.649 --> 00:43:54.800
because if you think about it, if you're part

797
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.719
of a big union, right? And there's like loads

798
00:43:57.729 --> 00:44:00.860
of you, it's your whole workplace and you're organizing

799
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.919
for higher wages, telling your boss we're going to

800
00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:05.199
go on strike. If you don't give us higher

801
00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:08.030
wages, you feel powerful, you feel part of something,

802
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.570
right? If you're just one worker and you aren't

803
00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.110
getting paid enough, but you go to your boss

804
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.010
and you ask your boss as an individual for

805
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.629
a raise, they're probably gonna say no. And then

806
00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:21.280
you're gonna blame yourself. You're gonna feel powerless. You're

807
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.919
gonna be like, I don't have any control over

808
00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:25.129
my life. I don't have control over, you know,

809
00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:28.260
the conditions in which I work. And so that

810
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:32.850
like, powerlessness is a really important part of what

811
00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.419
keeps our system functioning is basically people think I

812
00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:37.719
can only rely on myself. I can't organize with

813
00:44:37.729 --> 00:44:40.780
other people. I can't trust other people. So it's

814
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:44.229
all up to me and it's just on me

815
00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:46.379
to kind of compete and to struggle and to

816
00:44:46.389 --> 00:44:47.860
push other people out of the way in order

817
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.330
to get what I want, right? Um And that

818
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.530
undermines our capacity to hold those at the top

819
00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.620
to power because they're not going to listen to

820
00:44:57.629 --> 00:45:00.330
any one person. It has to be a kind

821
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.810
of collective movement and a collective uh process of,

822
00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.560
of kind of organizing and of struggle. Um And

823
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.560
like individualism has really undermined our capacity to do

824
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.219
that or even to imagine that you could be

825
00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:14.649
part of a political movement that would change the

826
00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:18.159
conditions of, of your existence. Um And like, it's,

827
00:45:18.169 --> 00:45:20.540
that's been pushed in a number of different ways.

828
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.344
So Margaret Thatcher in the UK famously, there's no

829
00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:26.465
such thing as society, there was a big effort

830
00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:29.104
to break up the unions. So to use the

831
00:45:29.114 --> 00:45:32.534
police use force basically, and the law to like

832
00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:35.554
pull people apart. Um There's been a lot of

833
00:45:35.564 --> 00:45:38.695
centralization in big cities, so little. So communities have

834
00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:41.135
been kind of broken up. Um And all of

835
00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:45.354
this along with kind of mass consumerism has really

836
00:45:45.364 --> 00:45:50.580
promoted this ideology of um of individualism. So kind

837
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:53.590
of pushing back against that and encouraging people to

838
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.889
trust each other and to work together and to

839
00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:59.520
organize is like the number one priority for anyone

840
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.850
who wants to see social change happen. Um And

841
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.610
you know, there, there are lots of examples as

842
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.489
as to how that can be done. And I

843
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.250
look at a load of those examples in the

844
00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.770
book. Um So one of my favorite examples uh

845
00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.120
comes from the UK and it's the Lucas plan.

846
00:46:15.129 --> 00:46:18.070
So there was this firm called Lucas Aerospace that

847
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.239
was kind of potentially gonna go under. Um It

848
00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.010
wasn't, you know, competing internationally. So the workers um

849
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.969
went to the government and said we need a

850
00:46:26.979 --> 00:46:29.129
bailout, we need you to nationalize this firm so

851
00:46:29.139 --> 00:46:31.100
we can keep our jobs. But the government said

852
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.219
we can't do that. But why don't you try

853
00:46:34.229 --> 00:46:37.260
and put together uh you know, a plan to

854
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:41.810
save the firm? So these unionists uh all basically

855
00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.770
like worked together and they consulted all of the

856
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.209
workers within this firm and said, how can we

857
00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:49.790
save the firm? What can we start producing that

858
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.870
will make us competitive again? And they came up

859
00:46:51.879 --> 00:46:54.739
with this plan called the Lucas plan, which was

860
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.600
designed entirely by workers. So all of the workers

861
00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.159
within this firm said we're gonna stop producing weapons,

862
00:47:00.169 --> 00:47:02.159
which is primarily what they were producing. And we're

863
00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:07.209
gonna start producing healthcare equipment, environmental equipment like wind

864
00:47:07.219 --> 00:47:11.020
turbines, um just socially useful products that we can

865
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.649
feel proud to make. And they then designed a

866
00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.679
whole business plan about how uh showing how they

867
00:47:16.689 --> 00:47:18.870
would transition from the current model to the new

868
00:47:18.879 --> 00:47:21.629
model. Um You know, basically saying that, you know,

869
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:23.790
the workers would be uh would be owners of

870
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.090
the firm, they would run the firm. Um And

871
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.209
just kind of designing a whole new system for

872
00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:32.030
operating this uh this giant company. And what that

873
00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.209
shows, I think is it really undermines this idea

874
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.300
that people need to be managed and controlled and

875
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.060
that's really the foundation of a capitalist economy. It's

876
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:42.770
the idea that we can't trust each other, we

877
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.060
can't work together to achieve our collective goals. We

878
00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.080
have to give our power to someone else so

879
00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.889
that they can tell us what to do.

880
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.120
It's also, it's also that very common idea that

881
00:47:55.129 --> 00:47:59.129
we hear many times that there's supposedly uh an

882
00:47:59.139 --> 00:48:03.899
elite of people who are highly intelligent, highly capable

883
00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:06.820
and you ju we just need to give them

884
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.429
all the money because they will make all the

885
00:48:09.439 --> 00:48:12.520
right decisions and they will grow the economy and

886
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.040
everything will be better forever. I mean, something like

887
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:16.389
that.

888
00:48:16.989 --> 00:48:20.209
Yeah, exactly. And that's actually what a lot of

889
00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:23.929
kind of neo liberal and free market economists believe.

890
00:48:23.939 --> 00:48:25.760
Um YOU know, I, I start the book by

891
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.209
looking at this quote from Hayek and he says,

892
00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:30.889
freedom of thought will only ever be of relevance

893
00:48:30.899 --> 00:48:33.600
to a small minority. Basically, most people are too

894
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.770
stupid to take advantage of the freedoms on offer

895
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.489
to them. Um Whereas, you know, the kind of

896
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:46.120
socialist view is that everybody has um intelligence, the

897
00:48:46.129 --> 00:48:49.590
capacity to control their lives to work with other

898
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.770
people, everybody has skills, you know, everybody has these

899
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.379
unique capabilities that just need to be kind of

900
00:48:57.389 --> 00:49:01.300
encouraged and developed so that everyone can flourish and

901
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.219
that we can all work together. And the best

902
00:49:03.229 --> 00:49:06.250
way to do that is for us to come

903
00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.320
together and teach each other, right? Um So a

904
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.080
lot of like the workers movement in the UK

905
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.659
and like around the world comes from groups of

906
00:49:15.669 --> 00:49:18.689
workers who would come together and study capital, they

907
00:49:18.699 --> 00:49:21.899
would study the Communist Manifesto often this was, you

908
00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:23.860
know, they would learn how to read in this

909
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.560
context, right? It was through co-operatives of workers that

910
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.949
would teach each other and would learn from each

911
00:49:29.959 --> 00:49:33.120
other and would work together to develop themselves and

912
00:49:33.129 --> 00:49:36.449
to strengthen the group. Um And that I think

913
00:49:36.459 --> 00:49:38.669
is something that has, has definitely been lost as

914
00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:41.570
we've moved to this individualistic society. And if we're

915
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.320
ever gonna get out of the mess that we're

916
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:48.169
in today, we have to move away from individualism.

917
00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.875
You know, there's not gonna be a powerful workers

918
00:49:51.885 --> 00:49:55.274
movement or a powerful social movement capable of resisting

919
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:58.215
the power of capital. If we all are just

920
00:49:58.225 --> 00:50:01.264
focused solely on ourselves, we need to have this

921
00:50:01.274 --> 00:50:04.504
open collective consciousness that is going to kind of

922
00:50:04.514 --> 00:50:07.955
drive forward progressive social change.

923
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.780
Yeah, it's actually very interesting that at a certain

924
00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:15.590
point you mentioned there that of course, workers have

925
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.270
their own expertise and skills because I I mean,

926
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.429
isn't that obvious, isn't it obvious that in different

927
00:50:22.439 --> 00:50:26.000
industries, the workers are the ones who actually have

928
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:29.729
the expertise in the specific kind of area they've

929
00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:32.209
been through, went on and they work on because

930
00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:36.060
many times the higher ups are just there to

931
00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.469
try to extract money from labor and they know

932
00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:44.290
nothing about how the products are created and anything

933
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.179
about, uh, I don't know, engineering, computer science or

934
00:50:48.189 --> 00:50:49.860
whatever it might be.

935
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.250
Right. Yeah, exactly. Um, I have, uh, I know

936
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.889
someone who's a management consultant and, uh they say,

937
00:50:56.899 --> 00:50:58.909
you know, whenever they're hired to go into a

938
00:50:58.919 --> 00:51:02.449
firm, the first thing that the consultants do is

939
00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:05.370
go and ask the workers, how is the product

940
00:51:05.379 --> 00:51:07.060
made? What goes on around here? They don't, you

941
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:09.469
know, waste their time asking managers what's going on.

942
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.840
They try and like, you know, um, they try

943
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.939
and kind of please the managers so they'll spend

944
00:51:15.949 --> 00:51:17.229
a lot of time talking to the managers being

945
00:51:17.239 --> 00:51:18.350
like this is what we're gonna do, da da

946
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.649
da. But they get their information from the workers

947
00:51:21.659 --> 00:51:23.360
because those are the ones who are actually kind

948
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.780
of producing the commodities and understand how these firms

949
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.719
work. Um And you know, there's loads of examples

950
00:51:28.729 --> 00:51:30.090
that I look at in the book of like

951
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:32.729
workers who have taken control of the firms that

952
00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:35.679
they work in, um, all throughout history and have

953
00:51:35.689 --> 00:51:38.340
done so to great effect. There's lots of examples

954
00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:42.610
of worker co-operatives, um and not also just in,

955
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.270
in commodities production also when it comes to house

956
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.399
building. For example, we have this idea of community

957
00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:51.469
land trusts where a community comes together, buys a

958
00:51:51.479 --> 00:51:53.800
parcel of land, builds housing on that. And then

959
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.000
the houses are all owned by the community and

960
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.449
support all the people living in that community. Um

961
00:51:58.459 --> 00:52:00.570
And all of this, I think, you know, the

962
00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.469
biggest, one of the biggest things that underlies individualism

963
00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:08.169
is this idea that we're all kind of competitive

964
00:52:08.689 --> 00:52:13.310
individuals who are just desperate to push each other

965
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.479
out of the way to get to the top,

966
00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:18.020
right? And if you look at human psychology and

967
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:22.199
anthropology and sociology, that isn't how human societies work,

968
00:52:22.209 --> 00:52:24.610
you know, we have learned to co-operate, we're one

969
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.870
of the most co-operative species alive, we compete between

970
00:52:29.879 --> 00:52:32.620
groups. So you see that quite a lot, you

971
00:52:32.629 --> 00:52:34.560
know, there are, there's competition between groups, but as

972
00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:38.915
groups, we have learned how to cooperates and to

973
00:52:39.024 --> 00:52:41.844
work together to survive. That's one of the like

974
00:52:41.854 --> 00:52:46.745
distinguishing features of, of humanity. But those cooper impulses

975
00:52:46.754 --> 00:52:50.614
have basically been crushed by a system that realizes

976
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:55.235
that if we co-operate, then we'll have power and

977
00:52:55.245 --> 00:52:57.135
that will undermine the power of those at the

978
00:52:57.145 --> 00:53:02.350
top. Um So individualism is this really important feature

979
00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.979
of most capitalist economies. Um And it's particularly important

980
00:53:05.989 --> 00:53:09.149
in the wealthy capitalist economies because those are the

981
00:53:09.159 --> 00:53:12.489
places that workers have potentially a lot of power.

982
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.429
You know, if like the workers in America say,

983
00:53:15.439 --> 00:53:19.209
we're able to form powerful unions, powerful political parties

984
00:53:19.219 --> 00:53:22.090
and take, you know, put, put into uh into

985
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.560
government, a political party that was on the side

986
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:28.350
of organized labor that would transform the global economy,

987
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.629
not just the American economy. So it's very, very

988
00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:35.120
important to the development of capitalism that they don't

989
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:38.290
do that, that they're divided by, you know, race

990
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.629
by geography um by this ideology that tells them

991
00:53:41.639 --> 00:53:44.139
that they can't co-operate with one another because if

992
00:53:44.149 --> 00:53:47.219
that wasn't the case, capitalism basically wouldn't survive.

993
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.949
So let me ask you one last question then

994
00:53:50.959 --> 00:53:55.340
looking at the current state of global capitalism and

995
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:59.179
particularly, for example, something that I'm very worried about

996
00:53:59.189 --> 00:54:04.429
the rise of the far right across many countries

997
00:54:04.439 --> 00:54:07.179
in Europe, the US as well. Uh Or at

998
00:54:07.189 --> 00:54:10.060
least some of the far right discourse that we

999
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:15.510
have now very commonly. Uh Are you optimistic about

1000
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.972
uh I mean, people organizing themselves to really try

1001
00:54:19.982 --> 00:54:25.183
to take over the, the system because i it's

1002
00:54:25.193 --> 00:54:26.742
uh I, I mean, I would like to be

1003
00:54:26.752 --> 00:54:29.673
a little bit more optimistic myself but, uh over

1004
00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:32.583
and over historically and we're seeing it again right

1005
00:54:32.593 --> 00:54:35.903
now. People seem to fall very easily for the

1006
00:54:35.913 --> 00:54:40.222
sort of extreme right wing sort of narratives about,

1007
00:54:40.232 --> 00:54:44.022
oh, it's uh immigrants fault, it's the fault of

1008
00:54:44.325 --> 00:54:47.385
people. They're taking too much from the States, stuff

1009
00:54:47.406 --> 00:54:51.545
like that. And they never, ever, ever point the

1010
00:54:51.555 --> 00:54:56.696
finger at uh the ultra rich, the company owners

1011
00:54:56.706 --> 00:54:59.156
and stuff like that. So, I mean, are you

1012
00:54:59.166 --> 00:55:02.486
optimistic or not? And particularly also let me just

1013
00:55:02.496 --> 00:55:06.025
add one last thing, the current levels of economic

1014
00:55:06.035 --> 00:55:09.496
inequality that are rising. I mean, that also worries

1015
00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:11.706
me. So, what are your thoughts on that?

1016
00:55:12.479 --> 00:55:15.500
Yeah. So I wouldn't say I'm optimistic that if

1017
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.939
things continue, we'll end up in a good place.

1018
00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:21.629
But I am optimistic that we can change things.

1019
00:55:21.639 --> 00:55:25.429
I believe that if we start now, we can

1020
00:55:25.449 --> 00:55:27.709
change the economies and the societies in which we

1021
00:55:27.719 --> 00:55:31.169
live. And I think the reason that we're seeing

1022
00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.989
the rise of the far, right at the moment

1023
00:55:33.439 --> 00:55:36.199
is that we're in this unique historical situation where

1024
00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:40.800
the vast majority of people recognize that capitalism isn't

1025
00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:43.300
working, that democracy isn't working in a lot of

1026
00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:47.500
places because it's been undermined by extreme inequality. Um

1027
00:55:47.649 --> 00:55:50.139
And so they know that this system is broken

1028
00:55:50.149 --> 00:55:53.449
that they're living in, but they feel powerless to

1029
00:55:53.459 --> 00:55:56.659
do anything about it. So, you know, there's lots

1030
00:55:56.669 --> 00:55:58.860
of people who feel very angry about inequality about

1031
00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:00.209
the fact that they're not paid enough to feed

1032
00:56:00.219 --> 00:56:04.229
their family. Um, THEY are, you know, angry about

1033
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:08.050
that. They don't have housing, they're anxious about the

1034
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.060
state of the world and everything that's going on.

1035
00:56:10.459 --> 00:56:13.939
But they don't have a sense of their collective

1036
00:56:13.949 --> 00:56:16.139
power to change anything because everything is as you,

1037
00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:18.409
as an individual. So you, as an individual feel

1038
00:56:18.419 --> 00:56:20.290
very powerless because you're not paid enough money. You

1039
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.310
can't afford your house. You know, the world is

1040
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.020
collapsing around you and you don't think, oh, I

1041
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.340
need to organize with other people to change things.

1042
00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.475
You think you look other individuals and you think,

1043
00:56:30.485 --> 00:56:32.155
oh, that person has more money than me. That

1044
00:56:32.165 --> 00:56:34.294
person has, you know, more money than me or

1045
00:56:34.304 --> 00:56:37.864
whatever. And you think, oh, I'm gonna blame that,

1046
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:40.395
you know, those, those individuals over there or that

1047
00:56:40.405 --> 00:56:43.504
group over there for taking something away from me,

1048
00:56:43.514 --> 00:56:47.379
right? Because you don't think the people at the

1049
00:56:47.389 --> 00:56:49.270
top of society need to be held to account.

1050
00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:52.860
That's not because you don't think that like taxes

1051
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:55.229
should be higher or there should be more public

1052
00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:59.669
services or that, you know, billionaires should uh you

1053
00:56:59.679 --> 00:57:02.070
know, should be constrained and, and kind of controlled

1054
00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.600
a bit more. You do think those things but

1055
00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:07.760
you don't feel powerful enough to take on those

1056
00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.340
at the top of the economy. You know, you

1057
00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.219
look at politicians and you think they're all the

1058
00:57:11.229 --> 00:57:13.514
same. They never listen, look at kind of the

1059
00:57:13.524 --> 00:57:15.284
owners of big businesses and you just think, well,

1060
00:57:15.294 --> 00:57:17.594
they're operating on a different planet for me. There's

1061
00:57:17.604 --> 00:57:20.715
nothing I could do to kind of control them

1062
00:57:20.725 --> 00:57:24.375
or control businesses. So, you just think, how can

1063
00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:27.425
I control my little world and all you see

1064
00:57:27.435 --> 00:57:29.044
in that little world is you and then a

1065
00:57:29.054 --> 00:57:31.195
few other people who are kind of poorer than

1066
00:57:31.205 --> 00:57:35.104
you. But you think, oh, they're taking something away

1067
00:57:35.114 --> 00:57:37.455
from me, right? So migrants or people who are

1068
00:57:37.465 --> 00:57:40.290
on social security or whatever, um You don't feel

1069
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.219
powerful enough to actually change the structure of the

1070
00:57:43.229 --> 00:57:46.209
system. You just think I just want to, you

1071
00:57:46.219 --> 00:57:49.709
know, move some pieces around and the very unfair

1072
00:57:49.719 --> 00:57:53.429
world that I inhabit. So if we want to

1073
00:57:53.439 --> 00:57:55.449
tackle the rise of the Far right, we need

1074
00:57:55.459 --> 00:57:58.419
to confront this sense of powerlessness that makes people

1075
00:57:58.429 --> 00:58:02.699
feel angry and angry enough to say it's migrants,

1076
00:58:02.709 --> 00:58:05.760
it's benefits scroungers and also angry enough to elect

1077
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.290
politicians who say I'm gonna drain the swamp. I

1078
00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.649
know that the system isn't working. I'm just gonna

1079
00:58:11.659 --> 00:58:13.310
burn it to the ground. It's quite like a

1080
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:17.620
nihilistic conspiratorial ideology that people on the Far right

1081
00:58:17.629 --> 00:58:19.489
often have, which is that they know that the

1082
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.969
system isn't working. They know it's really unfair, but

1083
00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:26.389
instead of trying to organize together, they project their

1084
00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:29.169
political agency onto someone else like a Donald Trump

1085
00:58:29.179 --> 00:58:32.080
or Marine Le Pen. And that person says, I'm

1086
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.770
going to save you. I'm going to kind of

1087
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.750
tear down the whole system and build something better

1088
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.679
in its place. So it's again a very individualistic

1089
00:58:40.689 --> 00:58:42.459
thing. It's like that person over there is gonna

1090
00:58:42.469 --> 00:58:46.030
rescue me. Um And you know, I think the

1091
00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.709
only way to push back against that is to

1092
00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:51.550
give people to respond to that sense of powerlessness

1093
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.100
by giving people a sense of belonging in social

1094
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.340
movements. And that could be any different kind of

1095
00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:00.120
social movement. So it can be like organizing in

1096
00:59:00.129 --> 00:59:01.810
your workplace as part of a union, it can

1097
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.899
be organizing in your community. Um It can be,

1098
00:59:04.909 --> 00:59:06.639
you know, getting involved in a protest movement in

1099
00:59:06.649 --> 00:59:09.540
the environmental movement, in a tenant union, whatever. As

1100
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.310
soon as you start pulling people out of this

1101
00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:17.820
individual box mindset and start encouraging them to see

1102
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.939
much more openly the system in which they live

1103
00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:24.239
by organizing with other people, by realizing that they're

1104
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.419
not alone that when they work with other people,

1105
00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:29.260
they have power, you start to chip away at

1106
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:32.439
that individualism and you start to encourage people to

1107
00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:35.479
think. Well, actually, if I can, let's say, get

1108
00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:38.179
involved in this campaign to save my local library,

1109
00:59:38.189 --> 00:59:40.260
why can't I get involved in a wider political

1110
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.949
campaign to change the structure of the society in

1111
00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:45.370
which I live? Um So that's why I think

1112
00:59:45.379 --> 00:59:49.250
it's so so important to start attacking individualism by

1113
00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.379
getting people involved in almost any kind of, of

1114
00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:56.050
collective organizing to shift their consciousness.

1115
00:59:57.070 --> 01:00:00.850
Great. So Grace, let's perhaps uh wrap up the

1116
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.530
interview here. Let's send on that positive note. And

1117
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:08.419
the book is again, vulture capitalism, corporate crimes, backdoor

1118
01:00:08.429 --> 01:00:10.889
bailouts and the death of freedom. I'm of course,
