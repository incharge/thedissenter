00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.950
Hello, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.559
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.770
joined by Doctor Steve King. He's an independent researcher

4
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.760
in economics, as well as distinguished research fellow at

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.909
University College London. And today we're talking about his

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.079
latest book, Rebuilding Economics from the Top down. So,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.389
Doctor King, welcome to the show. It's a huge

8
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.350
pleasure to have everyone.

9
00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.290
Thank you for having me on.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.979
So, of course, since we're talking about rebuilding economics

11
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.659
here, I guess we have to go back to

12
00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:35.939
some of the basics and that's actually what we're

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.500
going to do today before we get into some

14
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.049
of the more complicated stuff. So my first question

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.560
would be, what is economics actually? I mean, what

16
00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.740
does economics study and what is its role in

17
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.459
society?

18
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.470
I suppose the broadest definition would be to say

19
00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.830
that it's the uh the study of the commercial

20
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.970
relationships between people in uh predominantly in market economies.

21
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.430
And uh and, and that allows almost any, any

22
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.080
form of analysis what we've had over the centuries.

23
00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.580
There's a range of different paradigms that have approached

24
00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:14.370
answering uh that, that question about how to commercial

25
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:19.209
uh systems function in different ways. And I'm a

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.239
staunch critic of the current system, which I think

27
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.360
is completely misleading about the actual nature of uh

28
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.680
of uh production exchange and distribution in a capitalist

29
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.199
economy.

30
00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:33.529
So let's talk then a little bit about some

31
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.059
of the foundations of the current mainstream system or

32
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.709
even mainstream economics, even on an academic level. So

33
00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.010
what would you say are perhaps some of the

34
00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:48.339
main tenets of economics? And uh I mean, some

35
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.169
of its foundations that you tend to disagree with

36
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.050
the most.

37
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.239
The answer is virtually everything. Um The, the, the

38
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.879
starting point of the if you had to take,

39
00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.580
pick what, what is the fundamental meme. We we

40
00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.599
live in the day of internet memes and the

41
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.940
fundamental meme of mainstream economics is the supply and

42
00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:09.309
demand curves intersecting supply and demand. It's far more

43
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.570
elaborate than that these days and how it's put

44
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.880
together. But that's the, the fundamental vision that every

45
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.505
uh person who accepts the approach to economics uh

46
00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:21.774
users. And that argues that uh um a market

47
00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:25.345
economy is uh one in which both uh you

48
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.414
can, you can calibrate uh market demand for each

49
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:32.145
commodity and market supply for each commodity. Market demand

50
00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:36.095
falls as price rises, market supply rises as price

51
00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:40.154
rises and the market system reaches equilibrium. And uh

52
00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:42.615
and the the best possible situation is to allow

53
00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.610
that to happen in as many markets as possible.

54
00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.350
And the best way to do that is to,

55
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080
is to avoid what they call market imperfections and

56
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.139
that largely amounts to government intervention and any form

57
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.929
of concentration of power. So that's uh uh against

58
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.199
unions and against monopolies. And that is the founding,

59
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.320
the founding vision of how capitalism functions and it

60
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.860
is not quite but almost totally wrong.

61
00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.660
So let's get more specifically into that. Uh So

62
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.339
if I understand it correctly, one of the criticisms

63
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.059
you have here is that in mainstream economics, they

64
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.600
sort of derive their macroeconomic models from microeconomics, right?

65
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.240
So could you explain that? I mean, how they

66
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.419
do that and what you see as the main

67
00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:32.419
problems there?

68
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.850
Well, the, the neoclassical economics, which is the, the

69
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.610
school of thought we're talking about fundamentally began as

70
00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.399
a theory of microeconomics with the concept of general

71
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.309
equilibrium. And the idea is you had Marshall's idea

72
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.020
about how a single, a single market functions and

73
00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.740
that's where we got the supply and demand curves

74
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.250
from. It was Marshall was the first one I

75
00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.860
I believe the first one to draw a supply

76
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.729
and demand diagram and the footnotes to his principles

77
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.070
of uh economics. And uh and he argued that

78
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.699
that each individual market would reach equilibrium. Uh Volar

79
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.919
who was the one of the other major founders

80
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:12.559
of neoclassical economics, imagined not just one market but

81
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.420
uh a market for all commodities simultaneously. Uh WHICH

82
00:04:16.428 --> 00:04:18.920
was with his idea was that you could reach

83
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.238
a general equilibrium where supply equal demand in all

84
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.799
markets. So those are the two foundation visions. Now,

85
00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.200
when you take a look at at each element

86
00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:32.250
of this, it fails either mathematically or empirically or

87
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.029
both. So for example, the idea of a a

88
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.640
rising supply curve is derived from the concept of

89
00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:43.459
diminishing marginal productivity. Uh WHEN uh economists have ver

90
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.119
as they have done very, very rarely go and

91
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.910
ask individual firms what their cost structure looks like?

92
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.549
They get nothing like diminishing marginal productivity, they anything

93
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.730
they get increasing marginal productivity. So one of the

94
00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:58.829
one of the elements is empirically wrong vars model

95
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.450
of how markets function was an abstract idea. Uh

96
00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:06.709
THAT was extended from the Pa Parisian Bourse where

97
00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:09.929
there were individual markets for each commodity sold by

98
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.070
the bourse. And he imagined bringing them all together

99
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.920
in one room. And that, that then involves effectively

100
00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:18.869
matrix mathematics uh as as a as a by

101
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.739
product of trying to model the interaction of end

102
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.070
markets with n markets and mathematicians with no ill

103
00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:29.549
will towards economics whatsoever. Uh Prove that the nature

104
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.380
of the matrix that was used in that is

105
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.209
such that the process is unstable, it doesn't reach

106
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.589
equilibrium. So we get all these elements where uh

107
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.660
what looks like when you, when you first put

108
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.470
the theory together looks like a well founded system,

109
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.489
in fact fails in the real world either for

110
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.769
mathematical reasons as in the case of general equilibrium

111
00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.160
or see a sheer fact in the case of

112
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.149
the shape of the supply curve. Now that unfortunately,

113
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.369
the mainstream economists normally either don't know about those

114
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.450
failings or if they do, they ignore them or

115
00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:04.540
they think that somebody has solved the problem. So

116
00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:07.549
what's my problem in raising them? All of which

117
00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.809
is false? Uh It's, it's a, it's a fundamental

118
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.000
set of problems, but they therefore believe you've got

119
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.540
to use that foundation to build macro now that

120
00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:17.519
foundation itself is invalid. That's wrong. It simply shouldn't

121
00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.019
be used. So why should you build macroeconomics on

122
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.480
the basis of a macroeconomic which is false. That's

123
00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:26.209
the first element. The second is uh AAA large

124
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.250
system is fundamentally a complex one and complex means

125
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.799
that interactions between components uh are nonlinear and therefore

126
00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.170
you can't do the type of editing thinking that

127
00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:41.760
mainstream economists do. And no, it, it's, it's crazy

128
00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:47.980
how pervasive nonlinear effects are in not just human

129
00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:51.019
life but in the universe itself. Uh BECAUSE it's

130
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.079
easy for us. And this probably reflects our evolution

131
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.929
to think in linear terms. We extrapolate from here

132
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.470
forward. We, you know, if your income rises by

133
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.279
5% in one month, you extrapolate that forward for

134
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.549
5% every month. It just seems to be part

135
00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.579
of human nature. Maybe that's how we work out.

136
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.809
The mathematics of throwing stones. God knows. Um BUT

137
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.950
we, we can't handle exponential processes. So we tend

138
00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:17.450
to think in linear terms And that when you

139
00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:19.369
can, when you think in linear terms, you can

140
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.970
aggregate from the individual element to the mass because

141
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.869
all your interactions are additive. So it's easy to

142
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.519
put them together. That way, when you have nonlinear

143
00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:30.989
interactions, you can no longer do that, the, the,

144
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.489
the whole will be different to the sum of

145
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.299
the parts substantially. So, so with that level, you,

146
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:42.690
you, you, you cannot use for example, organic chemistry

147
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.019
to derive biology. Now, obviously, biology must obey the

148
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:50.369
rules of organic chemistry. But you can't then say,

149
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.089
well, I can take organic chemistry and I can

150
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.690
derive biology unless you can answer the question. OK,

151
00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:57.609
what chemicals do you need to put together under

152
00:07:57.619 --> 00:08:01.739
what circumstances to create life? Now, that question has

153
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.540
never been answered, probably never will be answered. But

154
00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:06.730
that's equivalent to what economists think they're doing when

155
00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:09.410
they think they derive macro from micro. Uh And

156
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.230
the best argument is was actually given by uh

157
00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:15.670
a Nobel Prize winner in physics uh Philip Anderson

158
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.209
and he wrote a beautiful paper called Moore is

159
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.130
different. And the argument there was that the aggregations

160
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.559
of, of in individual entities behave in a way

161
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.670
that cannot be derived from the behavior of those

162
00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:32.669
individual entities themselves. So economics hasn't got the memo

163
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.479
that paper was published over 50 years ago. So

164
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:38.340
I think over 60 years ago now, and economists

165
00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.530
are still trying to derive a high level from

166
00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.549
a lower level and the, the what what Anderson

167
00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:46.669
described this as, as a perverted form of reductionism.

168
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.549
Uh Science has, has often tried to explain a

169
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.700
large level process by breaking it down into constituent

170
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.659
parts. He said that's, that's a reasonable, you know,

171
00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.270
we've been achieved a, a large amount of success

172
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.599
that way, but we have never gone from the,

173
00:09:00.609 --> 00:09:04.599
the micro level to the aggregate. Um In that

174
00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:07.409
case, you would be using quantum mechanics to derive

175
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:10.760
Newton's uh inverse square law. No, we don't. We

176
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.250
take them as, as laws that apply in different

177
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:19.169
domains. So economists are 60 years behind science and

178
00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:21.679
think they're think they're advanced at the same time.

179
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.960
And it it's just wrong, we have to derive

180
00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:27.280
macroeconomics from macroeconomics itself. And that's one thing I'll

181
00:09:27.289 --> 00:09:29.330
show you can do in that new book.

182
00:09:30.489 --> 00:09:33.590
So let me just ask you specifically because I'm

183
00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:36.150
not sure if you ended up touching on this

184
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.710
point specifically or not. But also for the audience

185
00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:41.000
to get a better understanding of what we're talking

186
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.640
about here at a certain point there, you mentioned

187
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.710
something along the lines of we really not being

188
00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:51.229
able to derive higher level processes from its individual

189
00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:55.140
constituents or components. So does that also apply to

190
00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.705
how in mainstream economics, people understand demand as the

191
00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:04.515
sort of uh the market demand curve being the

192
00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:09.116
horizontal sum of individual demand curve, something like that?

193
00:10:09.236 --> 00:10:09.315
Yeah.

194
00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.846
Yeah. And that's um that is something which you'll

195
00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:16.185
find economics X books glossing over and often the

196
00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:18.926
authors apparently are unaware of the complexities that are

197
00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:21.116
involved in this. But when you think about how

198
00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:23.075
an individual demand curve is derived, and this is

199
00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:25.521
part of the instruction of any undergraduate student to

200
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:28.142
go through this process, you start from the assumption

201
00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:31.452
of a set of immaculately conceived indifference curves which

202
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:35.182
relate, you know, consumption levels of two different commodities

203
00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:37.932
to give you the combination of, you know, a,

204
00:10:37.942 --> 00:10:40.992
a line of combinations which give you the same

205
00:10:41.002 --> 00:10:43.492
utility. And then from that, you can go through

206
00:10:43.502 --> 00:10:47.702
deriving an individual demand curve, starting with the assumption

207
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:50.072
that varying price does not vary the income of

208
00:10:50.081 --> 00:10:54.900
the consumer that's vital. OK. Then when you go

209
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.630
to driving a market demand curve, the, the the

210
00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.859
book, the textbooks just jump from the individual to

211
00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:03.000
the market often without discussing the aggregation issue. A

212
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.969
group of mathematical uh economists beginning actually way back

213
00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:09.710
in 1953 the year of my birth with a

214
00:11:09.719 --> 00:11:13.159
guy called Gorman and then Samuelson in 56. And

215
00:11:13.169 --> 00:11:15.299
then it was, this issue was rediscovered in the

216
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.710
late sixties and early seventies by Son and Sean

217
00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:22.590
Mantel, Schafer de Bru and a few others. And

218
00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.669
they s and they try to derive the market

219
00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:28.320
demand curve from individual demand curve. And of course,

220
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.450
once you bring the market in, you have to

221
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.229
have everybody in the economy. If you're talking individual

222
00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:36.820
demand curve for, for bananas in America, you have

223
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.179
a single person. If you're talking about the market

224
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.130
demand curve for bananas. In America, you're talking 350

225
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.830
million consumers, some of them are gonna be banana

226
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.549
producers, other banana consumers, etcetera, etcetera. So when you

227
00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:50.700
vary the price, you must vary the income of

228
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.599
each agent in the system. And what that means

229
00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:55.210
is that if you just think of just think

230
00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:58.580
of uh graphically when you derive the individual demand

231
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.799
curve, you have a fixed point where you have

232
00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:05.000
a, the, the, the assumed income and the assumed

233
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.710
prices of all other commodities. Apart from the one

234
00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:10.390
whose price you're varying, it then vary the price

235
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.780
of the one on the horizontal axis while keeping

236
00:12:12.789 --> 00:12:16.200
the point of rotation on the vertical axis fixed.

237
00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:19.239
Now, when you say that there's actually price changes

238
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.099
will affect the distribution of income, you can no

239
00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:24.979
longer do that, that point moves. And therefore, when

240
00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.640
you then if you, you mentioned that for 350

241
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.489
million people individually, all of their little points of

242
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.909
rotation moving upwards and downwards with each change in

243
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.940
the relative prices, you do when you sum that

244
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.849
uh result, you can get any polynomial shape at

245
00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:44.359
all. OK? And this, this and this was proven

246
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.820
particularly well by Schafer and Sonnenschein. If you find

247
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.169
a book called the, the handbook of Mathematical Economics

248
00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:54.010
by Arrow and invigilator, you'll find their substantial chapter

249
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.409
on that issue and what they conclude with is

250
00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:58.880
to say that the utility hypothesis, they have a

251
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.380
caveat at the end. But it's one of these

252
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.409
caveats that say if there are Martians, then maybe

253
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.349
other things happen. Uh But they, they basically say

254
00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:10.169
the utility hypothesis tells us nothing about market demand.

255
00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:13.390
Now, that is not what is taught in the

256
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.010
textbooks. They start from the utility drive the individual

257
00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:20.330
wave wave of magic wand. Here's the market demand

258
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.020
curve in reality. Uh USING a derivation process, you

259
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.580
can get any polynomial shape at all. And the

260
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.739
reason for that is quite simple when you think

261
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.859
about it, the neoclassical vision of the individual does

262
00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:35.739
not include their income. OK? It it it it

263
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.619
it it simply says takes their income as given,

264
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.179
doesn't say where it comes from and doesn't relate

265
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.679
that income to anybody else's income. If you look

266
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.719
at the classical school, they talked about capitalist workers,

267
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.429
landlords, some of them talked about bankers as well.

268
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.799
So the the the classification of individuals and the

269
00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:56.119
social classes gave you a source of income and

270
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.510
also gave you a a nature of consumption as

271
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.119
well that was abolished by the Neoclassical. So they're

272
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.039
talking about isolated individuals. Therefore, they don't have any

273
00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:08.039
information in their model of the individual in terms

274
00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:10.809
of the distribution of income. So therefore, they cannot,

275
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.229
what actually happens when you change? When you make

276
00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:15.739
something more expensive, the poor can no longer afford

277
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.989
to buy it. So demand will fall. But they

278
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.700
can't even reach that explanation because they've ruled out

279
00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:25.510
individual income comparisons in their definition of microeconomics. So

280
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.049
consequently, they cannot derive a market demand curve. And

281
00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:31.479
then on top of that, I mentioned the supply

282
00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:34.590
early, we'll probably talk about supply more later. But

283
00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:38.659
supply curve does not exist. Instead what happens is,

284
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:39.909
I mean, for example, I can, I can put

285
00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:41.700
this across fairly simply, can you tell me the

286
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.390
market price for a car in, in, in France

287
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.820
right now?

288
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.460
Uh No, I don't think so.

289
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.169
There's no such thing is there, there's not a

290
00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:53.609
market price for comma for pri there's first of

291
00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:55.479
all, there's no such thing as a car. There

292
00:14:55.489 --> 00:15:00.260
are many, many uh individual transport uh sealed three

293
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.650
or four wheeled vehicles, ok? But there's Lamborghinis and

294
00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:06.719
there's pradas and everything else in between. So what

295
00:15:06.729 --> 00:15:09.010
you have is, is a list price is applied

296
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.929
for each of those uh uh machines. Some of

297
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.349
those list prices completely exclude large parts of the

298
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.830
market, others anybody can afford. Um And they are

299
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.989
list prices which are which you either pay, take

300
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.500
the price or you don't uh you either buy

301
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.440
the Lamborghini at this price or you don't buy

302
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.929
the Lamborghini, you don't negotiate the vo down and

303
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.280
the price doesn't fall as the number of buyers

304
00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:35.190
rises. The whole framework is simply wrong about how

305
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.609
a market economy actually functions. So we we, we

306
00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:40.320
have a set of myths which are ingrained to

307
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.549
people. And this meme that I think it's very

308
00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:44.809
important to think of it as a meme that

309
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.650
is a reference point which almost all economists exist

310
00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:50.119
a accept, which does not exist in the real

311
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:50.479
world

312
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.070
also. Is it really the case? As I think

313
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:02.630
mainstream economics still assumes that individual consumers uh behave

314
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.530
as u utility maximizing individuals. I mean, isn't that

315
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:09.580
also an issue or?

316
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.710
Yeah, it's, it's another uh I gotta get another

317
00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:17.099
case of, of just ignoring the obvious complexity in

318
00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:20.500
the real world. Because if you, if you, if

319
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.690
you draw a utility maximizing consumer behavior on a,

320
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.950
on a textbook piece of paper, then it looks

321
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.450
like Varian and mascle and Mankiw and so on.

322
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.369
It's two dimensional paper is two dimensional. So you

323
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.830
have bananas on the vertical axis and orange is

324
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.140
on the horizontal axis. And then if you have

325
00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:40.109
100 if you have, if you're gonna consider, you've

326
00:16:40.119 --> 00:16:42.030
actually put numbers on the axis which you'll almost

327
00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:44.219
never see. But if you do put numbers on

328
00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:45.880
the axis, you might have between one and 10

329
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.950
bananas per day, let's say, and one and 10

330
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.789
oranges per day. Uh And that gives you 100

331
00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:55.090
combinations. Now it's fairly easy if you draw a

332
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:57.830
line across that, which is, you know, diagonal line,

333
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.179
which is supposed to represent income, there's only gonna

334
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.339
be about five or 10 uh combinations of bananas.

335
00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.430
And what did they use oranges um that, that

336
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.709
come close to that line. So you've got to

337
00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:12.380
do about 10 combinations of cost and 10 combinations

338
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.709
of utility. It's a no brainer. It's very easy

339
00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:17.290
to do. What happens when you want to include

340
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.959
anchovies in that list or toothpaste, etcetera, etcetera, you

341
00:17:21.969 --> 00:17:24.160
have to add an extra axis. And each time

342
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.469
you do, you go from 10 to 100 to

343
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.469
1000 to 10,000. By the time you get a

344
00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:33.030
six or so commodity, you've got a million different

345
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.459
combinations. Now, to show that physically, if you wanted

346
00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:39.719
to simply go shopping with, you know, six, you

347
00:17:39.729 --> 00:17:43.010
know, six different commodities with between zero and 10

348
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.329
units of each, you can fill a million shopping

349
00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:48.410
trolleys with a different combination that enables you to,

350
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.479
to place and you're supposed to pick out the

351
00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:54.469
one that maximizes your utility nonsense. Uh That is

352
00:17:54.479 --> 00:17:56.900
cannot be the, the description of how people actually

353
00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:00.209
behave when they go shopping at the local supermarket

354
00:18:00.219 --> 00:18:04.359
where you might face 1000 or even 10,000 commodities.

355
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.369
There is no way you're, you're doing utility maximizing

356
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.160
to decide what to do. Instead, you use simple

357
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.949
old rules of habit, you buy what you bought

358
00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:15.199
last time. Uh You have conventions. If you b

359
00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:18.479
to a particular religion, you might not buy pork.

360
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.040
Um You know, things like this drastically reduce what's

361
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.550
known as the cursive dimensionality because the more um

362
00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:28.400
our component, the more individual entities you think of

363
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.430
in a system, the, the number of combinations of

364
00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:36.160
those entities rises hyper exponentially. So it is impossible

365
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.589
to compute that com that so-called utility maximizing and

366
00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:43.069
what people instead do is they w what, what

367
00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:46.109
Simons once described as satisfying? And a large part

368
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.800
of that is not considering all options but eliminating

369
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.109
the consideration of options. So that's real consumer behavior.

370
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.589
And as I said, you might know that there's

371
00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:57.760
a German academic uh silt that did a wonderful

372
00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.770
study back published in 1997 I think in the

373
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.569
economic journal where he attempted to test and show

374
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:09.310
his students their, their preference, individual preference curves using

375
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.300
uh Samuelson's idea of revealed preference and 95% of

376
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.849
them violated the axioms. And I think s actually

377
00:19:16.859 --> 00:19:20.900
ceased being an academic economist after that experience. And

378
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.170
that's often the choice you face. If you actually

379
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.609
try to confront these theories against the real world,

380
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.209
you find they fail and you either ignore the

381
00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:31.410
failure and stay in the classical economist or you

382
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.449
take it seriously and you cease being one.

383
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.089
So let me ask you now, then about more

384
00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:41.829
of the supply end of things. So we've talked

385
00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:45.640
about demand uh on the supply end of things.

386
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.839
What would you say are some of the assumptions

387
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:52.880
that mainstream economists bring into their models that you

388
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.260
think we should probably question

389
00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:59.349
in supply theory of supply, the whole idea of

390
00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:04.270
diminishing marginal productivity. Um THIS is something which is,

391
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.949
I think that the neoclassical model of production is

392
00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:09.530
really just a remapping of the model of consumption.

393
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.319
Ok. Yeah. And you get utility from seeing different

394
00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:16.050
commodities. Each energy one you add gives you less

395
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.459
extra utility that's reasonably. Ok. I mean, if the

396
00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.699
first banana is ok, you try to feed me

397
00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:23.349
10 bananas. I'm gonna kill you if you try

398
00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.329
to put it the 11th down my throat. OK?

399
00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:28.329
So there's definitely a diminishing marginal utilities to consume

400
00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:30.819
more bananas in a, in a set time period.

401
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.670
Uh But to then think you can do that

402
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.319
in a factory. You know, you, you cannot throw

403
00:20:35.329 --> 00:20:37.449
anything you like onto a blast furnace and get

404
00:20:37.459 --> 00:20:39.699
iron ore. I get iron out the other side.

405
00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.160
You've gotta be throwing in fairly precise mixtures of

406
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.089
iron ore and coal and, and, and o other,

407
00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:48.430
you know, energy and so on to get the

408
00:20:48.439 --> 00:20:53.010
output. So production is much more um stylized than

409
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.079
consumption, even consumption. We now know, you know much

410
00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:58.959
more about the deep biological details of what we

411
00:20:58.969 --> 00:21:02.339
need is inputs. If you don't throw um vitamin

412
00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:05.430
C into your system, there's consumption, whatever else you

413
00:21:05.439 --> 00:21:08.079
throw and you're gonna die of scurvy. OK. So

414
00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:10.390
there are limitations. So tho those things aren't thought

415
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.469
of by the mainstream those things. Uh What, what

416
00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:16.589
Paul Davidson, the, the, the lead great post keys

417
00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:19.280
economist who died just recently, he called the, the,

418
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:24.420
the fallacy of uh universal substitution if you don't

419
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.800
have one thinking to substitute another. So for example,

420
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.900
if there's not oxygen inside this room, then I

421
00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.770
can breathe nitrogen instead, I'll be dead in a

422
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.630
minute. OK? There are some things which are essential.

423
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.349
Now, when you look at production, as I said,

424
00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:40.920
it's, it's incredibly uh stylized uh a production system

425
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.130
is not like your stomach, it did not evolve.

426
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.739
It's designed by engineers and engineers will design a

427
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.979
factory so that it reaches its maximum efficiency. When

428
00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:54.869
it's being fully engaged, all machines are fully employed

429
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.250
inside the factory. And because you live in a

430
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.030
normally a growing economy, when you first build a

431
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.540
factory, it's gonna have at least 30% spare capacity,

432
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.339
if not 70 or 80% spare capacity. Because if

433
00:22:08.349 --> 00:22:10.089
you accept growth and you build a factory which

434
00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:11.739
is just big enough for the market. When the

435
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.839
day it's open, then you haven't done enough investing,

436
00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:17.339
it's too small. So for all these reasons, the

437
00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:20.500
the the factory below operates below full capacity and

438
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.349
you look at the empirical data, the highest level

439
00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:26.439
of capacity, utilization of American economy during the boom

440
00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:29.079
years of the sixties and early seventies was about

441
00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:33.030
90%. Now, it's running about 8075 to 80% capacity,

442
00:22:33.239 --> 00:22:35.719
but there's plenty of spare capacity there when you

443
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:40.300
expand production rather than getting uh putting more variable

444
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.160
units into each fixed unit past the point at

445
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.119
which you get the optimal output from that fixed

446
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.910
unit, you simply turn on more fixed units when

447
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.239
you have more variable units to operate them. So

448
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.280
there is and, and, and we get done inside

449
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.420
an overall factory, the efficiency of the factory's overall

450
00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:01.319
systems, air conditioning, internal transport, etcetera, etcetera will improve

451
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:03.729
as you get towards that full capacity level. And

452
00:23:03.739 --> 00:23:06.224
as you approach it, if the firm isn't sitting

453
00:23:06.234 --> 00:23:09.025
down and deciding at the managing director level where

454
00:23:09.035 --> 00:23:10.505
we're going to build the next factory, by the

455
00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:13.114
time you reach 100% you're you you're planning too

456
00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:16.964
slowly. So each mai each factory will, will have

457
00:23:16.974 --> 00:23:20.145
constant. Uh THE variable cost per unit will be

458
00:23:20.155 --> 00:23:24.005
constant and possibly falling. And that does not give

459
00:23:24.015 --> 00:23:26.425
you diminishing mart productivity at all. It gives you

460
00:23:26.435 --> 00:23:29.665
constant or rising. In fact, the whole idea of

461
00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.890
Martha productivity is largely irrelevant. Uh And what you

462
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.810
get is a constant cost effectively when you uh

463
00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:41.599
the per variable cost costing units cost of variable

464
00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:45.589
units per unit of output for all factories. And

465
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:48.229
when the surveys have been done, the the lowest

466
00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:52.579
level of discovery of, of firms having constant or

467
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:56.630
falling marginal cost. That's one of the implications of,

468
00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.589
of, of of constant or rising marginal productivity uh

469
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.420
is 89% that was found by Alan Blinder in

470
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:08.869
1999. Normally I find 95% to 99% of firms

471
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.119
report constant or falling variable cost per unit. So

472
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.750
the whole theory, all that stuff is simply empirically

473
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.770
wrong. And the fact that it's still taught shows

474
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.869
that economics is fundamentally not an empirical science. It's

475
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.069
a, it's a, it's a, it's a, a set

476
00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:28.959
of convenient fictions tied together and, and when, when

477
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:32.939
the fictions don't match reality, the adherents refuse to

478
00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:33.839
look at reality.

479
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:37.239
So perhaps this is a good point to introduce

480
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.270
this question. Why is it that these ideas that

481
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.910
we've been talking about that are part of mainstream

482
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.199
economics have become the mainstream? I mean, and, and

483
00:24:48.209 --> 00:24:52.020
why is it that if for example, someone who

484
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.989
is an economist is confronted with the fact that

485
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.829
the models he or she is using do not

486
00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:03.099
really match up with the real world? I I

487
00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:06.540
mean, why is it that perhaps they just ignore

488
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.369
it or they don't try to do things a

489
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.339
different way? I mean, is this uh what an

490
00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:13.780
ideology or

491
00:25:14.689 --> 00:25:17.800
it's an unconscious ideology? And, and I think it,

492
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.229
it, it you can't say that economists are different

493
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.770
from other disciplines on this front. This is this

494
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.910
is where the whole concept of paradigms came from.

495
00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:27.510
That Thomas coon identified back on the the structure

496
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.949
of scientific revolutions back in the sixties. And uh

497
00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:34.270
and what what humans do is that they develop

498
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.670
a AAA way of thinking about some aspect of

499
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.660
reality which becomes as coon called it their paradigm.

500
00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:44.160
So the paradigm in astronomy before Galileo was the

501
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.260
to make paradigm. And that said the earth is

502
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.650
the center of the universe and the sun and

503
00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.719
moon and stars rotate around it on perfectly concentric

504
00:25:51.729 --> 00:25:59.010
heavenly spheres. And that dominated the discipline for 1500

505
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.670
years or more. And the, the, and the, the

506
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.810
real puzzle in the discipline was feeding spheres on

507
00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:07.699
spheres, what are called epic cycles to explain why

508
00:26:07.709 --> 00:26:10.189
the f what then the, the known four planets.

509
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.170
Though at the time, this is all we know.

510
00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.280
This is back in the days when it was

511
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.119
only visual observation of the solar system, you could

512
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.250
see uh Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn. OK. And

513
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.380
they were called the planets. Because in Greek, old

514
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.760
ancient Greek planet means wanderer. They would reverse direction

515
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.959
at various times in the sky. And to fit

516
00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:35.290
that, that's where the, you know, the perfectly spherical

517
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.099
uh heavenly spheres had other heavenly spheres put on

518
00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:41.349
top and rotating to basically give you a, a

519
00:26:41.359 --> 00:26:44.550
empirical fit to the actual datum of the, the

520
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.349
movement of these four objects a against the pattern

521
00:26:47.359 --> 00:26:49.030
of the, all the rest they could see in

522
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.099
the universe. Now, when Galileo invented the telescope, and

523
00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:56.439
he was the person who made the first telescope

524
00:26:56.729 --> 00:26:58.510
and he then trained it on the moon and

525
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.959
saw it at 10 times the resolution that it

526
00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:02.989
could be seen with the naked eye, he saw

527
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:08.339
craters mountains and that was net that the heavenly

528
00:27:08.349 --> 00:27:11.500
spheres were not heavenly spheres, they were distorted he

529
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.339
then looked at Jupiter and this, this took a

530
00:27:13.349 --> 00:27:16.140
few more days of observation and he realized what

531
00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.670
looked like stars behind Jupiter were actually planets orbiting

532
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.040
Jupiter. And so that was a complete challenge. Now,

533
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.579
how did the toll maker Soomer react? We have

534
00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.530
documentary evidence from Gap Galileo and his correspondence with

535
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.439
Kepler. Did they refuse to look down the telescope?

536
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.550
They simply refused. Now, the reason being they in

537
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.170
a gut level, they knew that if they looked

538
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.390
down the telescope, they'd see something that challenged their

539
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.310
paradigm. And rather than doing it, they simply refused

540
00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:46.800
to take a look. And that is the same

541
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.800
state as economists today. Now, the the reason that

542
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.880
we still have this happening in economics is twofold.

543
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.640
First of all, once someone discovered planets using a

544
00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.959
telescope, anybody can discover planets using a telescope. So

545
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.479
the and and the planets never just never go

546
00:28:03.489 --> 00:28:07.910
away, they're always there. Um So therefore the anomaly

547
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.040
that that presents to the um to make paradigm

548
00:28:12.209 --> 00:28:15.770
is permanent and any new students coming along learn

549
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.770
of the anomaly, if any, any way before they

550
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.189
even learn about the paradigm. So it means that

551
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:23.030
you can have a bunch of old scientists lecturing

552
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.250
their students refusing to look down the telescope, trying

553
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.910
to explain the anomalies using the Tomac uh paradigm.

554
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.510
Students put up with it, but they know what

555
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.619
Galileo has done. And when the old fogy fogey

556
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.459
who's lecturing them, either retires or dies, the replacement

557
00:28:38.469 --> 00:28:40.660
has to come from the student body. One of

558
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.479
the student gets the job and they say right

559
00:28:42.489 --> 00:28:44.589
now, I'm going to use the telescope inside my

560
00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:47.829
lectures and then they get, we get generational change

561
00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:51.609
with economics that doesn't happen because the anomalies in

562
00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:54.650
economics are either logical ones which frankly, economists just

563
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.390
either don't know about or they ignore, I can

564
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.479
get plenty of detail on that later or they're

565
00:28:59.489 --> 00:29:02.530
a empirical event which you cannot reproduce. So there's

566
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.239
the Great Depression. When was the last Great depression

567
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.880
you experienced? Yeah. What were your feeling? How did

568
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.300
you feel during the Great Depression? You weren't even

569
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.770
born, your parents probably weren't even born. So consequently,

570
00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.010
we forget these events and, and therefore another anomaly

571
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.290
comes along and, and, and the, and the you

572
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.479
don't and you never get that confrontation between an

573
00:29:23.489 --> 00:29:27.079
irresolvable anomaly and the current paradigm. And the other

574
00:29:27.089 --> 00:29:28.969
side of it is a bit like again, the

575
00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:31.239
Tomac system with the way that got tied up

576
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.520
into the ideology of the Catholic church at the

577
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.729
time. So challenging to it was challenging God and

578
00:29:36.739 --> 00:29:40.359
that's why Galileo was put under house arrest. Um

579
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.569
That in economics, the equivalent there is that the

580
00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:47.530
neoclassical vision is of capitalism as a perfect system

581
00:29:48.329 --> 00:29:52.589
equilibrium, you get your marginal products. It's a meritocratic

582
00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:58.109
system with no concentration of power. Uh uh WHERE

583
00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:01.339
you, you maximize utility subject to the constraints and

584
00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:03.520
the cost of production and that is a vision

585
00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.579
of a perfect society and there's something in humanity

586
00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:10.219
that longs for perfection. We long for this ideal

587
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:12.979
system. That's why we get religious groups. And the,

588
00:30:12.989 --> 00:30:15.290
the, um you know, there's actually a wonderful joke

589
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.890
that I saw from an Australian uh commentator at

590
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.430
one stage who was agnostic, obviously talking about a

591
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:24.469
say a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian.

592
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.430
And it's having an alien witnessing the dispute and

593
00:30:27.439 --> 00:30:30.800
saying, so what you're telling me is that your

594
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.699
imaginary friend is better than his imaginary friend and

595
00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:39.479
they're the same friends. I'm gonna leave this planet.

596
00:30:39.489 --> 00:30:43.089
Bye bye. OK. So it, it, it's something about

597
00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:45.609
humanity. We want that to system. So what happens

598
00:30:45.619 --> 00:30:47.979
is, and this is, I've seen my own history.

599
00:30:48.109 --> 00:30:51.250
I broke away from mainstream economics in 1971 when

600
00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.859
my first year at university. Uh AND at the

601
00:30:53.869 --> 00:30:56.560
time I was to some extent intimidated by professors.

602
00:30:56.569 --> 00:30:58.119
I thought they must know more than I do.

603
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.589
I found out the hard way. They didn't um

604
00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:03.069
they knew less in many ways because I read

605
00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:05.439
more widely than they did. Um But the thing

606
00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:08.160
is I didn't get selected to replace the professor

607
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.310
at Sydney University. Somebody else did and that somebody

608
00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:14.219
else believe the stuff that I was seeing through.

609
00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:16.829
And I knew how bright that other person was

610
00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:18.400
and how broadly red they were and they were

611
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.050
trivial compared to me again. Not that I'm putting

612
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.280
myself up all that much. But I'm simply talking

613
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.699
about the con constraints that accepting a Siri puts

614
00:31:26.709 --> 00:31:28.989
upon the range of things you will consider and

615
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.359
the issues you will read and so on. So

616
00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:33.089
II I, you know, I, I no longer have

617
00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:35.219
to respect my senior because I am the senior

618
00:31:35.229 --> 00:31:38.050
these days, I've seen all these people come through

619
00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:41.390
and they believe in a way that I don't

620
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.640
and the belief holds them forward. So what happens

621
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.910
is rather than generational change happening as happens in

622
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.550
science? The professor says that kid over there thinks

623
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.479
like I do, I'm not making my research assistant.

624
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.880
I might get him on my publication list. I

625
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.209
might get him a few paper. I might even

626
00:31:58.219 --> 00:32:00.500
put him as bone primary author. Bang that guy

627
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.959
gets publication of the Economic Journal. He gets the

628
00:32:02.969 --> 00:32:07.150
provision replaces um the professor and somebody that I

629
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.469
regard as a, as a, as a, as a

630
00:32:09.479 --> 00:32:12.560
a well frankly a gym wet quite frequently. But

631
00:32:12.569 --> 00:32:14.760
you know, some of the very limited perspectives, they

632
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.170
become the professor. And II, I find myself as

633
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.449
I as I got higher and higher academic ranking,

634
00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:23.050
I went down to lower and lower universities because

635
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.430
only at that level did I find a university

636
00:32:25.439 --> 00:32:28.209
when neoclassical weren't competing with me to get the

637
00:32:28.219 --> 00:32:31.380
position so I could then dominate any of the

638
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.760
ordinary with my publication record and, and, and uh

639
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.959
and in the regard I'm held in I could

640
00:32:36.969 --> 00:32:40.410
get those positions. I went from University of New

641
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.599
South Wales, which was the, was the second or

642
00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:45.800
third ranked Australian University, the University of Western Sydney,

643
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.250
which is 20th or 30th but moderately ok. University

644
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.650
as things go globally to Kingston, which is ranked

645
00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.939
about 8/100 in the global system and definitely is,

646
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.609
is a low, a low ranked university overall. Um

647
00:32:58.619 --> 00:33:00.270
And that's the thing, the, the the people who

648
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.650
are critical of mainstream economics end up in the

649
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.130
lowest ranked universities. So ironically, if you want a

650
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.140
broad education in economics, don't go to Oxford, go

651
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.819
to a low rank university where you might get

652
00:33:09.829 --> 00:33:13.680
some interesting uh alternative perspectives, put you away. But

653
00:33:13.689 --> 00:33:16.329
that's that, that, that it's a long winded answer.

654
00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:20.199
But the basic story is the, the, the ideological

655
00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:22.140
role which they're not even conscious of it, just

656
00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:25.170
the perfect system vision that it gives them plus

657
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.180
the lack of generational change. That's why economics remains

658
00:33:28.189 --> 00:33:30.219
rooted in these ideas, which should have been thrown

659
00:33:30.229 --> 00:33:33.449
out empirically speaking or logically speaking as much as

660
00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:34.420
a century ago.

661
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:40.540
But doesn't this all also have real life consequences?

662
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.390
I mean, because people might be hearing this and

663
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.410
they might be thinking, ok, that's all fine. But

664
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.500
that's those are issues for the academics to deal

665
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.525
with. That's an academic issue in the realm of

666
00:33:53.535 --> 00:33:58.734
economics. But isn't it that these models are the

667
00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:03.724
ones that also influence political decisions, political decision making,

668
00:34:03.895 --> 00:34:07.805
economic decisions more specifically and have or can have

669
00:34:07.814 --> 00:34:11.004
political economic and social consequences.

670
00:34:11.668 --> 00:34:13.518
Oh, they have huge consequences. This is why they're

671
00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:16.329
so, if, if they were irrelevant, it was like,

672
00:34:16.339 --> 00:34:17.918
you know, if we, if we're debating what poets

673
00:34:17.928 --> 00:34:22.029
thought about uh about uh national infrastructure programs, it

674
00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:25.188
wouldn't matter. Cos poets don't influence the policy, economists

675
00:34:25.197 --> 00:34:27.049
set the policy. And like one of the most

676
00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:30.850
obvious examples is the Maastricht Treaty, uh which is

677
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.708
it, it's, that's got an element above and beyond

678
00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.800
neoclassical, that comes from what's called an auto liberal

679
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.520
uh uh framework. But the idea that public debt

680
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.550
is dangerous and deficits are dangerous uh is simply

681
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.120
empirically wrong and logically wrong. When you take a

682
00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:47.620
look at the double entry bookkeeping involved in, in,

683
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:50.750
in government finances, the government is not borrowing uh

684
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.310
when it sells bonds, it's selling an asset uh

685
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.239
to banks to replace, which is an income earning

686
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.949
tradable asset to replace what used to be non

687
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.800
income earning and it's certainly nontradable. Uh So it's

688
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.469
no, in no way. Does it resemble you and

689
00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:05.479
me taking out a bank loan? But that's the

690
00:35:05.489 --> 00:35:07.530
perspective they put on it. And therefore what you

691
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:12.379
get is inadequate public services running down. Um uh

692
00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:14.729
National Health, for example, is happening in the UK

693
00:35:14.739 --> 00:35:16.949
right now in the belief that, you know, future

694
00:35:16.959 --> 00:35:18.889
generations need to save the money. No, they don't.

695
00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:21.530
They need decent health. So it ends up with

696
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.830
having severe impacts upon um the the quality of

697
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.399
life we we experience and it, it, it turns

698
00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:33.550
up uh as well and things like how fast

699
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.379
do we recover from crisis? And where do we

700
00:35:35.389 --> 00:35:38.260
have crises in the first place? So mainstream economics

701
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.229
and if economics was genuinely a science, it would

702
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:44.629
have predicted the possibility of a financial crisis because

703
00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:46.560
it's a policy based science, we could have actually

704
00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:50.820
prevented it. Instead, mainstream economists are completely ignorant of

705
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.629
the possibility of a crisis coming along in 2007,

706
00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:57.939
2008, only uh econ class like me saw it

707
00:35:57.949 --> 00:36:00.209
coming and warned of it. And so they led

708
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:02.820
us into a financial crisis and then the recovery

709
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:04.750
from it, if you look at what they advised

710
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.870
Obama to do, cos Obama walked into that crisis

711
00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:12.110
when he became uh president in 2009. Um THEY

712
00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.550
told him to give money to banks and banks

713
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.189
will lend out 10 times as much money you

714
00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:17.860
give them and you've got a fast rate of

715
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.820
economic growth. When you look at the rate of

716
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.840
recovery from the 2008 crisis, it was the slowest

717
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.889
in recorded history so far from giving advice which

718
00:36:27.899 --> 00:36:30.290
gets things makes things better, it ends up making

719
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.159
stuff worse. And that again is why it isn't

720
00:36:33.169 --> 00:36:35.810
just an academic matter, it affects people's everyday lives.

721
00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:39.659
So since you mentioned there, that was an eight

722
00:36:39.669 --> 00:36:41.870
economic crisis, let me ask you a couple of

723
00:36:41.879 --> 00:36:46.080
questions about that. Did it actually have in the

724
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:49.639
long run or even in the short term, any

725
00:36:49.649 --> 00:36:54.100
impact at all on how people think about and

726
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.310
do economics

727
00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.139
nowhere near enough? Um Like I, when I saw

728
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:02.560
the crisis coming, the, the day that I worked

729
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.080
out, the crisis was approaching was roughly the 18th

730
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:11.159
of December 2005, circumstantial reasons as to why. Um

731
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.949
But I, I thought, you know, there's, I looked

732
00:37:13.959 --> 00:37:16.489
at the American and Australian data of private debt.

733
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.840
That's what I identified as the cause. And I

734
00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.419
saw an uh exponentially increasing ratio of private debt

735
00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:26.310
to GDP. So that can't continue when it stops

736
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.020
growing credit based demand will collapse and that will

737
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.560
cause probably the greatest economic downturn since, since the

738
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.139
Second World War. Um And I knew that if

739
00:37:37.149 --> 00:37:40.260
I didn't get my argument into the public arena

740
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.090
before it happened, I wouldn't be taken seriously afterwards.

741
00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.379
So there, that's one reason that I became more

742
00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:49.219
prominent globally. And also you got things like the

743
00:37:49.229 --> 00:37:53.750
rethinking economics movement, protest against autistic, economics, etcetera, etcetera.

744
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.399
All these various movements began, the Institute for new

745
00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:00.070
economic thinking was formed so on and so forth.

746
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.060
So there were certainly a diversity of views came

747
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.290
out of that crisis. But the mainstream still can't

748
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.649
explain why it happened and what they've done gone

749
00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:11.340
to, they've gone back to the same old models

750
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.649
they had beforehand, but they've had what they call

751
00:38:13.659 --> 00:38:16.689
financial frictions. And this is the idea that the,

752
00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:18.790
the, the way to explain why the crisis occurred

753
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.870
is to say that the financial sector imposes frictions

754
00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:24.489
that slow down how rapidly we return to equilibrium.

755
00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.600
Now, the whole idea of finance is a, is

756
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.479
a friction. I mean, it's a friction if you

757
00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:30.050
wanna, you know, do something and you haven't got

758
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.050
any money. Sure. Uh But when it comes to,

759
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.959
if you've got some speculative idea, it's not a

760
00:38:34.969 --> 00:38:38.850
friction, it's a lubricant. Um So the whole idea

761
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.590
that, you know, treating it as a way of

762
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.139
slowing down a return to equilibrium is just the

763
00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:45.909
wrong way to think about it. So it, it

764
00:38:45.919 --> 00:38:48.929
has led to uh more legitimacy for the sort

765
00:38:48.939 --> 00:38:51.129
of approach that I take, it's led to a

766
00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:54.260
wide diversity of views. So the mainstream is now

767
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.030
attacked from numerous sides now rather than just from

768
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.510
a handful of individuals like it was beforehand, like

769
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.620
me being one of them. Um So it has

770
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:04.739
led to a diversity of views, but the mainstream

771
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.449
has remained unmoved.

772
00:39:08.189 --> 00:39:11.770
And so what do you think should have been

773
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:16.060
the best way to deal with the 2008 economic

774
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.209
crisis? Do you think that for example, instead of

775
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:24.360
bank bailouts, we should have put money directly into

776
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.580
the hands of households. And if so, could you

777
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.649
explain perhaps why that would have been better?

778
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.649
Well, the whole problem is caused by too much

779
00:39:35.659 --> 00:39:38.560
private debt And if you look at the American

780
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.879
data, for example, private debt went from about 50%

781
00:39:41.889 --> 00:39:44.010
of GDP in the aftermath of world war 2

782
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.260
to 100 and 70% at its peak. And this

783
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.199
was regardless of ups and downs of the interest

784
00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:51.340
rates that just continued rising as a ratio of

785
00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.860
debt to GDP. And a large part of that

786
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.810
was people being enticed into taking out mortgages because

787
00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.689
we all, you know, believe, oh the house gets

788
00:39:59.699 --> 00:40:02.270
more expensive. That's good. I mean, nobody thinks a

789
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.260
car is getting more expensive is good but houses

790
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.629
are getting more expensive is good. And so we

791
00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:09.479
do is borrow money to buy the house. And

792
00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:11.750
it's actually the process of taking out new loans

793
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.909
that actually causes that increase in house prices. We

794
00:40:14.919 --> 00:40:17.610
really need to return to treating housing as a

795
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.760
as a long-term consumption good, not a, not an

796
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.919
investment, not a speculate, not a speculative asset, but

797
00:40:23.929 --> 00:40:25.290
you know something you you need a house to

798
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.439
live in period. Uh And if that was the

799
00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:29.580
case, the level of mortgage debt would fall from

800
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:32.010
say as a region of quite a few countries

801
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:35.060
fall from say 100% of GDP down to 20%.

802
00:40:35.429 --> 00:40:40.050
Now we should use the government's money curating capacity

803
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.729
to enable that to happen rapidly. So I propose

804
00:40:42.739 --> 00:40:44.179
the idea of what I call the modern debt

805
00:40:44.199 --> 00:40:47.050
jubilee where the government would give everybody in the

806
00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.520
country an identical amount of money. So Rupert Murdoch

807
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.090
would get the same amount that I would get.

808
00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:54.959
Uh AND, but then you were required to pay

809
00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:58.399
that off your debt. Now, Rupert Murdoch, $100,000 wouldn't

810
00:40:58.409 --> 00:41:00.379
make a dent and his level of debt would

811
00:41:00.389 --> 00:41:03.189
make a substantial debt debt in mine, dent in

812
00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:05.919
mine. Uh So you give people that money, they're

813
00:41:05.929 --> 00:41:07.580
required to pay the debt down. If they don't

814
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.270
pay the debt down, then they get uh cash

815
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.860
that they can either use to spend if you

816
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:15.280
want to encourage macroeconomic spending, or they could be,

817
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.780
have required to convert those into government bonds which

818
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.310
give them an income source. Um But so it

819
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.110
would be a, a univer uniform pattern across the

820
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.300
whole country and you would, that would increase the

821
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.790
level of recorded government debt. But that, as I

822
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.689
said, is, is an income earning asset for the

823
00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:33.290
private sector. It's not a burden for the government.

824
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.669
It's a government giving you something which they then

825
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:37.570
were committed to giving you an income stream over

826
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.320
time. Uh So the government could easily do that.

827
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.330
And with that reduction in debt, say from 100%

828
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.530
of GDP to 20% of GDP, we'd had a

829
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.699
fall in house prices, but that would have been

830
00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:52.919
compensated by the money individuals got per head and

831
00:41:52.929 --> 00:41:56.320
housing will be more a more affordable and we

832
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.030
would have had a lower level of debt and

833
00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.540
as it happens, and this is where the the

834
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.469
complex system side of capitalism comes in. When I

835
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:05.469
analyze the dynamics of a, of a complex system,

836
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:07.350
the type of work that I do in economics,

837
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:10.949
I have found that the increasing level of, of,

838
00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:15.110
of, of, of bank debt causes a fall in

839
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.030
the share of income going to workers. Yeah, it's

840
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.830
actually a causal process. It's not even though workers

841
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.909
might if you imagine firms are simply borrowing the

842
00:42:22.919 --> 00:42:25.340
money, which is what I model in my models

843
00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:29.429
of v dosky financial instability hypothesis. Even with just

844
00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:31.250
firms doing the borrowing and workers need to be

845
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.649
doing no borrowing at all. The dynamics of the

846
00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.780
system are such that the workers share of income

847
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.409
falls precisely as the banker share rises. So rising

848
00:42:39.419 --> 00:42:41.189
levels of private debt is more money to bankers

849
00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:45.409
and less to workers. And that's one reason capitalism

850
00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:48.669
is malfunctioning now, uh bankers don't spend their money

851
00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:51.520
very rapidly. Workers, do you get a lower level

852
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:54.590
of economic performance out of that situation as well?

853
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.610
So I would have gone through modern debt jubilee.

854
00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.719
Uh GIVE the money directly to households require those

855
00:42:59.729 --> 00:43:02.709
having debt to pay their debt down. Put conditions

856
00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:04.330
on how the money can be used by others,

857
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.919
which could be either buy bonds or if you

858
00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:08.340
wanted to boost the macroeconomy, then just spend it,

859
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.810
spend it well. And that would have eliminated the

860
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.530
crisis and reduced the private debt level from its

861
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.760
current running roughly 100 and 75% of GDP down

862
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:20.250
to say about 90% of GDP. This is private

863
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.530
debt and that is more manageable. And we could

864
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.159
have got back to a, a stable situation, uh,

865
00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:27.399
like the 19 fifties and sixties.

866
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:32.000
Mhm. So, uh, I'm going to get also into

867
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.330
some questions about that in a second also because

868
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.570
just a few months ago I had on the

869
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.330
show, your friend, Doctor Michael Hudson to talk about

870
00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:45.040
his books on that exact topic. But let me

871
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.250
just ask you because earlier, when we were talking

872
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.169
about some of the foundations and assumptions of mainstream

873
00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:56.594
economic mix, you mentioned briefly the fact that we

874
00:43:56.604 --> 00:44:00.754
should move into a model based on complex systems

875
00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:03.495
theory. So could you tell us a little bit

876
00:44:03.504 --> 00:44:07.314
more about that? I mean, how would the economics

877
00:44:07.324 --> 00:44:11.695
based on complex systems theory look like? And what

878
00:44:11.705 --> 00:44:13.915
are some of the main ways it would differ

879
00:44:13.925 --> 00:44:16.185
from what we have? Uh Now

880
00:44:17.199 --> 00:44:20.030
complex systems take it as granted the systems don't

881
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.860
reach equilibrium. So the whole fetish on reaching equilibrium

882
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.760
would be thrown out. It's just isn't the way

883
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.360
complex systems behave. Uh The most obvious complex system

884
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.979
is the weather and the weather is never an

885
00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:35.419
equilibrium. And with the, with the most uh famous

886
00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:38.360
stylized model of the weather was done by Lorenz

887
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.889
um Edward Lorenz back in the early 19 sixties

888
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.169
and he built a, a three dimensional model uh

889
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:47.840
which is basically like having water, having a AAA

890
00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:51.310
thin layer of water uh on a stove top.

891
00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.120
And you're looking at the horizontal and vertical location

892
00:44:54.129 --> 00:44:56.830
of a drop of water and the temperature difference

893
00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.010
between the bottom and the top of the hot

894
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.459
plate. And that was an incredibly simple system, they

895
00:45:01.469 --> 00:45:04.229
thought would reach equilibrium. And it didn't, it just

896
00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:09.939
continuously moved it far from equilibrium positions. So throw

897
00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:13.739
away equilibrium, OK. Equilibrium is a potential potential but

898
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:17.409
not a necessary uh feature of a dynamic system.

899
00:45:17.649 --> 00:45:20.320
Uh But when you look at real world dynamic

900
00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:23.879
systems, they have unstable equilibrium. So that's, that's your

901
00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:27.270
starting point. So non equilibrium thinking dynamic rather than

902
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.979
talking OK to supply and demand curves don't have

903
00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:32.520
time on the on the horizontal axis, they have

904
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.750
goods, they never actually say goods per unit of

905
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.699
time, etcetera, etcetera. So time sort of falls out

906
00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:40.969
of the analysis. A complex system analysis is fundamentally

907
00:45:40.979 --> 00:45:43.449
time based. So what you end up doing is

908
00:45:43.459 --> 00:45:47.159
rather than using algebraic equations, which are when when

909
00:45:47.169 --> 00:45:49.360
engineers take a look at what economists do, they

910
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.270
often choke. But they can't believe people are trying

911
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.379
to model a complex system like the economy using

912
00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:58.389
algebraic equations. They say you've gotta be using differential

913
00:45:58.399 --> 00:46:01.899
equations, equations to have change over time and one

914
00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:05.530
system state affects another system state ciris Paribus, which

915
00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.770
is one of these nonsense ideas. Economists will say

916
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.600
when they teach their partial equilibrium models, they say

917
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:13.399
assuming all other things remain constant nonsense, nothing else

918
00:46:13.409 --> 00:46:16.560
remains constant. Everything affects everything else. But what we've

919
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.729
done with complex systems, mathematics over the last half

920
00:46:19.739 --> 00:46:23.070
a century and this is completely passed, economic spy

921
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.120
is develop techniques to handle um systems where everything

922
00:46:27.129 --> 00:46:29.959
depends on everything else. And then the question becomes

923
00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:31.760
not, you know, what's the equilibrium going to be?

924
00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:33.929
But do you have enough of the causal factors

925
00:46:33.939 --> 00:46:35.969
in your model to cover the major ways in

926
00:46:35.979 --> 00:46:38.850
which things depend on other things that matter? So

927
00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.209
there's some things you wouldn't bother bringing in because

928
00:46:41.219 --> 00:46:43.790
they have such a small impact upon the quality

929
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800
of your prediction that it's not worth the extra

930
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.830
complication of including them. And that, that is the

931
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.235
way you pre approach building complex systems models. Uh

932
00:46:52.245 --> 00:46:54.135
But that would be the nature of complex systems,

933
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:58.584
differential equations rates have changed through times non equilibrium

934
00:46:58.594 --> 00:47:01.725
and looking at potential dynamic paths of a system.

935
00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:03.395
And how do you bring the capitalist case the

936
00:47:03.405 --> 00:47:06.425
most important question? How do you avoid it collapsing?

937
00:47:07.129 --> 00:47:09.100
And when I, when I do that, one of

938
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.510
my mathematician friends do that, they find that in

939
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.870
the opposite conclusion to what neoclassical economists reach, it's

940
00:47:15.879 --> 00:47:19.290
essential to have government spending because without government spending,

941
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.919
you can have a private sector collapsing into a

942
00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:26.820
period of where GDP collapses, your private debt ratio

943
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:30.810
becomes infinite employment and wages share of GDP collapsed

944
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.629
to zero. That's a potential outcome of a system

945
00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:35.899
without a government, put a government in there. And

946
00:47:35.909 --> 00:47:39.370
it has what mathematicians call persistence. So it, it

947
00:47:39.379 --> 00:47:42.639
ends with very, very different conclusions. But it, what

948
00:47:42.649 --> 00:47:44.850
it involves is it's throwing away the old tools

949
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.020
that come from the 19th century, throw away algebraic

950
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.770
logic and do it with, with system dynamics and

951
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.050
con and continuous time differential equation models.

952
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.739
Do you think that perhaps one of the reasons

953
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:02.100
why mainstream economists uh are also a little bit

954
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:07.050
reticent when it comes to perhaps trying to include

955
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:12.310
complex systems theory into their frameworks and models is

956
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.340
that perhaps it involves more complicated mathematics or

957
00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:21.780
they, they like to think they're good mathematicians, they're

958
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.830
good mathematicians with a very limited tool set which

959
00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.840
is inappropriate for what they're analyzing. Um But I,

960
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.290
I think, you know what I find when I

961
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.250
teach my students, the approach that I use, they

962
00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.080
get enthused by it. Um BECAUSE it, it is

963
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.500
a challenge of modeling a complex system and it's

964
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.889
exciting. So it, it, it's just that they don't

965
00:48:40.899 --> 00:48:44.229
want the conclusion that a complex system reaches and

966
00:48:44.239 --> 00:48:47.570
that those conclusions go against their wishes about how

967
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.850
they think capitalism should behave and they just turn

968
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.929
a blind eye to it. And I've become, I've

969
00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:57.810
come to realize that when you challenge somebody's paradigm,

970
00:48:58.149 --> 00:49:00.250
they just look for a reason to dismiss you.

971
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:02.209
When you say your model is not as good

972
00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:04.770
as my model within an existing paradigm, then they

973
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.919
have a lively debate. So when you go outside

974
00:49:07.929 --> 00:49:10.669
the paradigm, you lose them, they don't want to

975
00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:13.350
even consider and they, and they will use stupid

976
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.229
arguments to dismiss your challenge to their paradigm. So

977
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.989
uh that's what really goes on. And therefore, because

978
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.810
complex systems end up with non equilibrium outcomes and

979
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.949
they want equilibrium to apply, they don't want to

980
00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:27.290
know about complex systems.

981
00:49:27.729 --> 00:49:33.139
Mhm. So, within a complex systems, sort of uh

982
00:49:33.149 --> 00:49:37.879
economic paradigm, let's say, would it also include uh

983
00:49:37.889 --> 00:49:40.699
cyclicality? I mean, would the economic in

984
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.100
a complex system is inevitably cyclical? Um Because to,

985
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.889
to be um like in mathematical terms, if you

986
00:49:49.899 --> 00:49:53.850
build a a complex system with unstable equilibria, uh

987
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.699
then you will be forever migrating far from the

988
00:49:56.709 --> 00:50:00.550
equilibrium. And the, the basic characteristic is that like

989
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.120
like the lo Lorenzo system has three equilibrium points,

990
00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:07.709
uh one of which is stable along two axes

991
00:50:07.719 --> 00:50:10.570
and unstable along a third. And they're all what

992
00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.620
they called real axes. They had to give you

993
00:50:12.629 --> 00:50:16.419
repulsion or attraction. But the other two equilibria are

994
00:50:16.429 --> 00:50:20.459
stable along one axis with a, a real stability.

995
00:50:20.469 --> 00:50:22.540
So there was the value of the of the

996
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.310
what's called eigenvalue is negative along that real AX.

997
00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.610
But there are two complex axes which have positive

998
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.969
real parts. The complex axis gives you cycles where

999
00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:33.679
you get out of it is as you approach

1000
00:50:33.689 --> 00:50:36.810
the equilibrium, you can from a distance away, you

1001
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.179
can get attracted to one of these equilibria, but

1002
00:50:39.189 --> 00:50:41.889
as you get closer, you're repelled by it. So

1003
00:50:41.899 --> 00:50:43.969
what you get is a region around the equilibrium

1004
00:50:43.979 --> 00:50:47.770
where nothing ever, nothing ever penetrates and you're always

1005
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.129
far from equilibrium and, and that is the nature

1006
00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:52.169
of a complex system.

1007
00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.949
Mhm. So could you give us perhaps uh a

1008
00:50:55.959 --> 00:51:01.929
couple of examples of uh economic phenomena that through

1009
00:51:01.939 --> 00:51:06.750
a complex systems theory framework, we would get a

1010
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.300
new understanding of them. I I think that in

1011
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:12.195
your book, for example, at a certain point, you

1012
00:51:12.205 --> 00:51:16.895
go through employment and wages and how they would

1013
00:51:16.905 --> 00:51:19.804
change over time and how we could model that

1014
00:51:19.814 --> 00:51:23.975
through complex systems theory. So how in what ways

1015
00:51:23.985 --> 00:51:27.064
would it look different from what we now have

1016
00:51:27.074 --> 00:51:29.165
in mainstream economics?

1017
00:51:29.445 --> 00:51:32.425
It's totally different because if you look at a,

1018
00:51:32.475 --> 00:51:35.895
a neoclassical dynamic stochastic general Caribbean model, what they

1019
00:51:35.905 --> 00:51:39.500
do is they set up a algebraic system to

1020
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:43.179
generate a system of difference equations. Uh WHERE they,

1021
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.379
they, they, in fact, the, it's the framework for

1022
00:51:47.389 --> 00:51:51.199
the, what they call DS G models dynamic stochastic

1023
00:51:51.209 --> 00:51:54.530
general equilibrium is that there's a future point uh

1024
00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:00.020
where of an equilibrium between capital output ratio, effectively

1025
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:06.040
capital employment ratio and RR utility um satisfaction which

1026
00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:08.729
is unstable, it's a saddle. And so if you

1027
00:52:08.739 --> 00:52:11.409
imagine uh a saddle and you're trying to throw

1028
00:52:11.419 --> 00:52:13.510
a ball bearing, so it lands on the saddle.

1029
00:52:13.689 --> 00:52:15.979
The only hope you have is to get straight

1030
00:52:15.989 --> 00:52:17.580
in front of the nose or, or the arse

1031
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.860
of the horse, throw the ball bearing and it

1032
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.669
just gets just in that part of the ridge

1033
00:52:21.679 --> 00:52:24.610
which runs along the horse's mind never deviating over

1034
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.709
the side. Uh And then of course, if you

1035
00:52:26.719 --> 00:52:28.310
change the angle of the horse, you've got to

1036
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.959
move. So you're facing the nose once more. Well,

1037
00:52:30.969 --> 00:52:34.350
that fundamentally describes how they think uh cycles come

1038
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.050
about. So you have a future of this point

1039
00:52:36.629 --> 00:52:40.300
and that's given current uh uh what they call

1040
00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:45.060
technology and, and preferences and then you have some

1041
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.949
what they call shock to preferences in technology that

1042
00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:51.310
relocates this future location of the saddle. So you

1043
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.229
gotta move to a new point and you move

1044
00:52:53.239 --> 00:52:55.669
that new point by changing your investment and consumption

1045
00:52:55.679 --> 00:53:02.110
today. Now that ludicrously complicated mathematically fraudulent approach is,

1046
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.000
is what people do with Ds GE models. Mine

1047
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.800
just simply says here's the dynamics uh the, you

1048
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.419
know, the wages interaction with the employment rate and

1049
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.830
uh and debt levels interacting with profit and so

1050
00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.540
on. And you're gonna get unstable, the equilibrium will

1051
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:22.209
be either unstable um or, or or under some

1052
00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:26.090
limited conditions, stable under others, unstable and you'll cycle

1053
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.149
indefinitely until you have a breakdown unless you have

1054
00:53:29.159 --> 00:53:32.459
government spending to counteract it. So it's very, very

1055
00:53:32.469 --> 00:53:35.209
different. And I can also, I I like again

1056
00:53:35.219 --> 00:53:36.800
what a DS G model will set it up,

1057
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.360
put it in equilibrium and give it a shock

1058
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.040
and see how fast it takes to convert you

1059
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:44.979
back to the equilibrium. Again, um dynamic modeling, the

1060
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:48.060
complex systems, you set up the overall system, you

1061
00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.729
might want to change parameters while you do the

1062
00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:52.510
simulation. But even with fixed parameters, it will cycle

1063
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.239
indefinitely.

1064
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:57.459
But so le let's say that we are talking

1065
00:53:57.469 --> 00:54:01.469
about employment rates and wages and how they change

1066
00:54:01.479 --> 00:54:05.300
over time. If we model them through a complex

1067
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:09.429
systems approach, uh can we get, let's say perhaps

1068
00:54:09.439 --> 00:54:14.125
information in terms of how governments could deal with

1069
00:54:14.254 --> 00:54:19.925
situations where employment rates would be uh a bit

1070
00:54:19.935 --> 00:54:23.495
higher and wages would be lower. I mean, would

1071
00:54:23.504 --> 00:54:28.145
there be perhaps informed interventions to deal with those

1072
00:54:28.155 --> 00:54:29.165
kinds of issues?

1073
00:54:29.675 --> 00:54:31.245
One of the obvious ones for me, as you

1074
00:54:31.375 --> 00:54:35.020
don't have banks bearing too much debt, private debt

1075
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:38.350
and certainly not for speculative rather than investment purposes.

1076
00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:40.250
But even if they're creating just for investment, you

1077
00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.790
can have cycle will lead to breakdown. So you

1078
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.219
end up with a perspective saying the system can

1079
00:54:45.229 --> 00:54:49.350
breakdown, which is not neoclassical thing with, without government

1080
00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.520
invention, you'll reach equilibrium and it'll all be perfect

1081
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.500
and they're trying to manage the damage the government

1082
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.340
does to the system in the way of thinking.

1083
00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.675
From my point of view, a private sector system

1084
00:54:58.685 --> 00:55:02.274
without government almost certainly collapse into a debt deflation.

1085
00:55:02.385 --> 00:55:03.915
So if you bring government in, you're trying to

1086
00:55:03.925 --> 00:55:06.794
prevent that outcome occurring. One simple way is the

1087
00:55:06.804 --> 00:55:09.504
government spending actually counteracts. If it's done in a

1088
00:55:09.514 --> 00:55:13.435
counter cyclical fashion, counteracts the accumulation of private debt.

1089
00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:15.084
Uh The other way to go about it is

1090
00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:17.445
saying, well, we should be limiting what banks can

1091
00:55:17.455 --> 00:55:20.854
lend money for. Banking. Banks are not, you know,

1092
00:55:20.864 --> 00:55:23.574
but banks are not like making coffee cups. Ok.

1093
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:27.449
Um, CO coffee cups. We, we, you know, we,

1094
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:29.899
we, we, there's a, there's a physical use for

1095
00:55:29.909 --> 00:55:33.510
this thing with money you're borrowing and you're speculating

1096
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.810
on making future profit. And if banks are providing

1097
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:39.449
that money for industrial capital, then we're likely to

1098
00:55:39.459 --> 00:55:42.110
get new commodities, you and I can consume if

1099
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:44.229
they're giving it to financial assets and pausing up

1100
00:55:44.239 --> 00:55:46.370
house prices, we have houses, we can no longer

1101
00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:49.729
afford to buy. So there is reason you don't

1102
00:55:49.739 --> 00:55:52.489
want private money to be created to finance speculation.

1103
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.479
You want it to be financed for investment. So

1104
00:55:54.489 --> 00:55:55.800
you get a whole lot of range of different

1105
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:58.189
policies about what you do about banks in that

1106
00:55:58.199 --> 00:56:01.790
particular situation. Uh And you'd also end up, uh

1107
00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:06.850
you wouldn't be necessarily crucifying monopolies. Uh Again, the

1108
00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.979
whole idea that monopoly is bad and competition is

1109
00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:13.459
good comes out of, of small competitive firms are

1110
00:56:13.469 --> 00:56:15.989
good. That comes out of the neoclassical vision of

1111
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.489
diminishing marginal productivity and market demand curves falling, et

1112
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.870
cetera, et cetera. That's not the real world. You

1113
00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:23.699
look in the real world. You found there's a,

1114
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.120
in most industries, there's a what's called a Power

1115
00:56:26.129 --> 00:56:28.810
Law distribution. A few small firms have a large

1116
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.030
part of the market. Lots of small firms have

1117
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.189
a small part of the market that is part

1118
00:56:33.199 --> 00:56:35.919
of the evolutionary process that leads to innovation in

1119
00:56:35.969 --> 00:56:38.820
different industries. You want that structure to some extent.

1120
00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:42.010
And the monopoly rather than charging a low price,

1121
00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.010
a high price for a low quant quantity, which

1122
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.929
is what you'll get out of the textbooks tends

1123
00:56:45.939 --> 00:56:48.489
to charge a low price for a high volume.

1124
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:51.760
Uh BECAUSE again, the efficiencies of large scale production

1125
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.689
and consumers actually benefit out of that. So long

1126
00:56:55.699 --> 00:56:57.510
as the firm doesn't then go and use its

1127
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.010
market power to slaughter its potential rivals, which can

1128
00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.050
certainly happen. So you end up with a very,

1129
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:06.080
very different vision of how to manage uh individual

1130
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.850
corporations. Uh uh YOU know, corporate concentration, what we

1131
00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.820
get out of the neoclassical and you end up

1132
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.469
with a desire to control the financial sector rather

1133
00:57:14.479 --> 00:57:16.199
than letting it rip. And one of the great

1134
00:57:16.209 --> 00:57:19.560
problems of the so called reforms under Maggie Thatcher

1135
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.820
and Reagan, everybody who's followed in their footsteps is

1136
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.280
there's liberate what they've libera liberalized is what the

1137
00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.899
finance sector can do. It's had very little impact

1138
00:57:27.909 --> 00:57:32.290
upon uh industrial corporations, but it's an industrial corporation

1139
00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.610
we want to have doing the innovation rather than

1140
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.770
financial sector which innovates mainly to cause uh uh

1141
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.409
asset price bubbles.

1142
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.250
So let me ask you now then about uh

1143
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.500
that uh earlier, when I asked you about the

1144
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.870
2008 economic crisis. At a certain point, you mentioned

1145
00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.989
the possibility of uh us having done something like

1146
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.709
a modern day jubilee. So, uh I mean, basically

1147
00:57:59.939 --> 00:58:04.159
what is debt, what generates debt? And when it

1148
00:58:04.169 --> 00:58:08.219
comes to uh I mean, having a jubilee, what

1149
00:58:08.229 --> 00:58:12.199
would it include, would it be just private debt?

1150
00:58:12.209 --> 00:58:16.169
Uh ALSO public debt? Uh And what about uh

1151
00:58:16.179 --> 00:58:19.659
for example, commercial debt? I mean, what kinds of

1152
00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:25.129
debt would we include in the possible jubilee? For

1153
00:58:25.139 --> 00:58:25.800
example.

1154
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.870
Uh Actually, if you look back at the ancient

1155
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:29.899
jubilees and Michael would have Michael Hudson would have

1156
00:58:29.909 --> 00:58:31.120
done this with you when he was on your

1157
00:58:31.129 --> 00:58:35.770
show. And ancient jubilees affected household debt, not uh

1158
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.040
not business debt. So they write of household debt

1159
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:40.919
and the reason for that often was household debt.

1160
00:58:40.929 --> 00:58:42.570
You know, you'd be, you'd run up a tab

1161
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.479
at the, at the, at the mead hall and

1162
00:58:44.489 --> 00:58:47.649
you couldn't pay it, you'd buy, you'd borrow um

1163
00:58:47.659 --> 00:58:50.330
prior to a harvest and your harvest failed, etcetera,

1164
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.969
etcetera, you ended up as a wage slave and

1165
00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:55.570
as slender as a wage saver slave working on

1166
00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.570
the landlord's uh property and, and forfeiting your own.

1167
00:58:58.909 --> 00:59:00.820
And then what would happen with that? That meant

1168
00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:04.649
was those societies were challenged because only Freeman could

1169
00:59:04.659 --> 00:59:08.260
be in the army. So the more um slaves

1170
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:10.050
you had, the less army you had and that

1171
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.570
challenged the existence of the empire. So that gave

1172
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.530
you a countervailing reason why the uh the emperor

1173
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.649
would want to cancel private debts. And that happened

1174
00:59:18.659 --> 00:59:22.524
fairly regularly of every change of king, every 49

1175
00:59:22.534 --> 00:59:24.364
years. If not, uh if a king lived for

1176
00:59:24.375 --> 00:59:27.735
50 after 49 years, that sort of thing, abolishing

1177
00:59:27.745 --> 00:59:29.915
those debts, which let people go back to their

1178
00:59:29.925 --> 00:59:33.854
land, abolished their situation of slavery and so on.

1179
00:59:33.864 --> 00:59:35.735
Now, we can't do that today. It's much more

1180
00:59:35.745 --> 00:59:38.685
complicated, but I would use what they call the

1181
00:59:38.695 --> 00:59:40.774
modern debt jubilee. And that would be using the

1182
00:59:40.784 --> 00:59:45.520
government's money creation capability to cancel private debt. And

1183
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.260
then so you wouldn't be lumping the two together.

1184
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:49.699
You'd actually, if you had a modern debt, you

1185
00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:52.419
believe what we call government debt would rise as

1186
00:59:52.429 --> 00:59:55.100
a result of it, that private debt would fall.

1187
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.520
And even if I don't include changes in behavior,

1188
00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.959
when I model this, I get an increase in

1189
01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:05.080
economic activity because you're basically transferring money from bankers

1190
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.659
who spend very slowly to workers who spend very

1191
01:00:07.669 --> 01:00:10.100
quickly. If we go back to the fifties and

1192
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.449
sixties, and you take a look at the rate

1193
01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.649
of turnover of money in the American economy, money

1194
01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:17.699
turned over about 1.8 times per year. Uh It's

1195
01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:20.310
now running below one. Uh AND one reason for

1196
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.199
the money people spent more freely back in the

1197
01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:24.649
fifties is people weren't worried about paying off their

1198
01:00:24.659 --> 01:00:26.469
level of private debt because it was quite low.

1199
01:00:26.479 --> 01:00:29.139
Mortgage debt was low uh there was almost, there

1200
01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:30.979
was no credit card debt, there was lays and

1201
01:00:30.989 --> 01:00:33.020
stuff like that. So we had a much level

1202
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:36.149
of household debt and therefore households spend fairly not

1203
01:00:36.159 --> 01:00:37.949
thinking about if I don't hang on to some

1204
01:00:37.959 --> 01:00:39.520
of this money, I won't be able to service

1205
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.120
next year, next month's mortgage. Once you get the

1206
01:00:42.129 --> 01:00:44.129
level of debt we have now people are always

1207
01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:46.419
worrying about, can I pay my debt off? And

1208
01:00:46.429 --> 01:00:48.959
the way individuals respond to that is by spending

1209
01:00:48.969 --> 01:00:51.830
more slowly. Now, if you spend more slowly, you

1210
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.189
accumulate more money in your bank account, but the

1211
01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:56.629
person you would have spent on, doesn't we don't

1212
01:00:56.639 --> 01:00:58.510
create any extra money out of that. There is

1213
01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.510
no additional saving at the collective level out of

1214
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.010
individual decisions to save what you have instead is

1215
01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.530
accumulation by some and d accumulation by others and

1216
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.520
a slower rate of growth, turn of money and

1217
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.550
the income falls. So if you go back to

1218
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.149
the period where people are no longer scared of

1219
01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:17.709
the level of private debt, they're carrying the turnover

1220
01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:20.860
money might come close to doubling frankly and that

1221
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:24.629
could effectively double economic activity over time. So there's

1222
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.550
a real benefit to getting rid of the level

1223
01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.350
of private debt.

1224
01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:32.620
Mhm I I mean, in your mind, does this

1225
01:01:32.629 --> 01:01:35.909
have anything to do or is it at all

1226
01:01:35.919 --> 01:01:38.709
a moral question? I mean, because many times when

1227
01:01:38.719 --> 01:01:43.959
people think about specifically private debt, they say something

1228
01:01:43.969 --> 01:01:46.959
along the lines of, oh, if people have borrowed

1229
01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:51.679
money then they should pay it back, they should

1230
01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:54.879
pay their debts so many times. This is the

1231
01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:58.419
way we frame things. But from, uh, uh, I

1232
01:01:58.429 --> 01:02:01.899
mean, I'm not sure if a moral consideration should

1233
01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:04.850
also be made here, but just from an economics

1234
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.090
perspective, does that make sense at all?

1235
01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:13.500
We don't believe that drug pushers should be, uh,

1236
01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.479
uh, allowed to enforce their debts because we know

1237
01:02:16.489 --> 01:02:20.389
they're selling in the moral products. Um And the

1238
01:02:20.399 --> 01:02:22.659
same thing applies with private debt. If banks were

1239
01:02:22.669 --> 01:02:25.699
responsible in how they lent, then there may be

1240
01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.189
more of a case to say, well, then the

1241
01:02:27.199 --> 01:02:29.719
borrower should be responsible in paying the debt back.

1242
01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:31.449
But if banks are willing to lend like they

1243
01:02:31.459 --> 01:02:34.929
did in the subprime catastrophe back in the 2008

1244
01:02:35.139 --> 01:02:36.780
where they were lending to people they knew couldn't

1245
01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:39.110
repay the debt. And they, you know, they got

1246
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.370
all these terms like ninjas, no income, no job,

1247
01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:44.929
no assets, ok. And they're willing to lend to

1248
01:02:44.939 --> 01:02:47.530
somebody in that situation. The only reason being they

1249
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.260
knew that the individual banker would get a, a

1250
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.030
large bonus out of the amount of debt they

1251
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.969
created. So the more you created, the better off

1252
01:02:56.989 --> 01:02:58.669
and then you fobbed it on to somebody else

1253
01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:02.830
through uh or they collateralized obligations and other statistical

1254
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.330
devices that appeared to eliminate the risk, but of

1255
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.520
course, could not do it could not eliminate it

1256
01:03:07.889 --> 01:03:10.780
and, and sold stuff which was, um, you know,

1257
01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:15.350
fraudulent. Frankly. Now, frankly, most of those people should

1258
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.679
have gone, not, should have, should have gone to

1259
01:03:16.689 --> 01:03:20.929
jail. Only one banker went to jail over 2008.

1260
01:03:20.939 --> 01:03:23.399
That was Bernie Madoff. And you couldn't not put

1261
01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:25.919
Bernie Madoff in jail. He'd run a Ponzi scheme

1262
01:03:25.929 --> 01:03:30.429
for 40 years or thereabouts. So, whereas if we

1263
01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:32.100
look back in the 19 thirties and what's called

1264
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:36.199
the Pakora Commission, pardon me? Which was an inquiry

1265
01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:39.250
into what caused the Great Depression. Hundreds of bankers

1266
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:43.879
went to jail for morally reprehensible behavior which caused

1267
01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:47.419
the crisis. So let's let's do this evenly. Uh

1268
01:03:47.429 --> 01:03:49.520
I'd be quite happy to say people should repay

1269
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:54.280
their debts if banks lent responsibly since they don't.

1270
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.610
There's no moral case whatsoever for saying individuals should

1271
01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.949
have, must repay their debt.

1272
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.459
So let me ask you now then about inflation

1273
01:04:04.469 --> 01:04:08.040
because that's something that people, particularly over the past.

1274
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:09.850
I don't know, a couple of years have been

1275
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.800
uh worried a lot about what explains inflation actually.

1276
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.760
What's behind inflation?

1277
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.110
I have often, I like to take a little

1278
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.830
wine out of the National Rifle Association in America.

1279
01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:25.500
And they also who might have seen this one

1280
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.870
quite regularly. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.

1281
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.810
Well, my twist is that most people, conventional economy

1282
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.929
will argue money supply causes inflation. And my argument

1283
01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:40.419
is money doesn't cause inflation. People cause inflation and

1284
01:04:40.429 --> 01:04:42.929
that's rather more valid than the um uh the

1285
01:04:42.939 --> 01:04:45.770
nr a way of using the same thing. So

1286
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.379
there are 32 main groups of people who can

1287
01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:51.729
cause inflation, workers who demand wage rises in excess

1288
01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:54.129
of the rate of inflation and firms who can

1289
01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:55.860
put up their markups faster than the rate of

1290
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:59.010
inflation. And the other factor is the real factor,

1291
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.189
which is how many units of output are you

1292
01:05:01.199 --> 01:05:04.860
getting per worker? So you put those three factors

1293
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.510
together and this is done, I've done it informally

1294
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.979
in well, not informally done it formally in that

1295
01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:12.350
book but fairly aggregate data. Isabella Weber has done

1296
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.040
excellent work on the role of markups and causing

1297
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:19.030
inflation. And so has a statistician called Blair Fix

1298
01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:21.879
and they do much more disaggregated work. But the

1299
01:05:21.889 --> 01:05:23.929
basic message coming from the work, all three of

1300
01:05:23.939 --> 01:05:26.699
us do is that what actually caused the inflation

1301
01:05:26.729 --> 01:05:30.909
for the last 40 or so years was predominantly

1302
01:05:30.919 --> 01:05:33.199
the rate of change of markups exceeding the rate

1303
01:05:33.209 --> 01:05:35.449
of inflation. So the people who are putting up

1304
01:05:35.459 --> 01:05:38.300
prices weren't the workers with the wage demands. It

1305
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.889
was the capitalists by putting a larger markup on

1306
01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:44.939
their cost of production to determine price. And like

1307
01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:47.010
for, for about if you look back over say

1308
01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.780
100 quarters of data, then for about 80 of

1309
01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.709
those quarters, markups rose rated higher than the rate

1310
01:05:52.719 --> 01:05:55.439
of inflation for about 15 of them or 20

1311
01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:57.899
maybe w wages rode higher than the rate of

1312
01:05:57.909 --> 01:06:00.600
inflation. And then the underlying thing is what's happening

1313
01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:04.389
in output per worker that generally speaking rose, which

1314
01:06:04.399 --> 01:06:07.459
actually reduces the rate of inflation until COVID hit.

1315
01:06:07.469 --> 01:06:10.159
Then we had all those supply shocks. So the

1316
01:06:10.169 --> 01:06:11.959
basic argument that comes out of that and Isabella

1317
01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.750
Webb has made this very well too is that

1318
01:06:15.189 --> 01:06:18.370
the the predominant cause is markups rising too rapidly.

1319
01:06:18.379 --> 01:06:21.250
Now, a major cause behind that is the uh

1320
01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.770
destruction of the union movement. Cos unions used to

1321
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.689
bargain for wage rises and those wage rises would

1322
01:06:26.699 --> 01:06:30.129
mean that the, the markups were constrained by the

1323
01:06:30.139 --> 01:06:33.459
potential increase in wages as well. So, abolishing trade

1324
01:06:33.469 --> 01:06:36.330
unions contributed to the power that firms have to

1325
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.449
put up prices, contributed to the potential for inflation

1326
01:06:39.459 --> 01:06:41.939
we saw in the post COVID period and then

1327
01:06:41.949 --> 01:06:44.300
the supply chains which are being built up, which

1328
01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:46.739
are incredibly fragile. We uh if you know, if

1329
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.489
you know the, the, the m most people don't

1330
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.060
have any real idea of how things are made

1331
01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:55.100
these days, the vast majority of the population longer,

1332
01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:58.620
certainly the West works and actually in factories, making,

1333
01:06:58.629 --> 01:07:02.330
making goods and services. Um BUT, but what we

1334
01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.520
had was a supply chain which where to make

1335
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.370
a particular product, you might go through 30 or

1336
01:07:06.379 --> 01:07:10.050
40 different countries with a couple of 1000 components.

1337
01:07:10.399 --> 01:07:14.370
That's an incredibly fragile system. It's very efficient but

1338
01:07:14.379 --> 01:07:17.219
equally very fragile because it is very efficient. So

1339
01:07:17.229 --> 01:07:20.179
when COVID hit and break disrupted that supply chain.

1340
01:07:20.189 --> 01:07:22.409
We got increases in cost out of that. Uh

1341
01:07:22.419 --> 01:07:26.760
But Isabella Weber has argued that we should constrain

1342
01:07:26.949 --> 01:07:28.750
the extent to which firms can put up markups.

1343
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.389
Since we've destroyed the trade union movement as a

1344
01:07:31.399 --> 01:07:34.439
balance against the power of corporations, we should have

1345
01:07:34.449 --> 01:07:38.149
the government uh having the power to limit how

1346
01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:41.760
fast markups can be increased and or to reduce

1347
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:45.750
markups in critical industries for workers consumption. And if

1348
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.310
you did one of the most interesting elements of

1349
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.129
that is to take a look at inflation in

1350
01:07:49.139 --> 01:07:52.389
America. In the 1st and 2nd World War. In

1351
01:07:52.399 --> 01:07:54.750
the first World War, there was no controls and

1352
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.850
it's actually quite a high rate of inflation in

1353
01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.110
America across the war years. They learned from their

1354
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.669
lesson and when the Second World War began, they

1355
01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:07.389
created a prices commission and a non orthodox economist,

1356
01:08:07.399 --> 01:08:10.350
John Kenneth Galbraith was put in charge and the

1357
01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.840
inflation during the Second World War was constrained by

1358
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:16.370
firms agreeing not to decrease the markups despite the

1359
01:08:16.379 --> 01:08:19.350
high level of monetary demand at the time. And

1360
01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:21.509
there was almost no inflation during world war two.

1361
01:08:21.879 --> 01:08:24.419
So it's feasible to control it. You you don't

1362
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.529
let the people who have got the power use

1363
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.100
that power by having a countervailing force, which is

1364
01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:31.399
what trade unions use to apply or the government

1365
01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:33.680
stepping in in the same role and limiting how

1366
01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:35.140
fast markups can increase.

1367
01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:41.939
And is inflation always a problem? Uh WHEN, when

1368
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:43.180
is it a problem?

1369
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.500
It's a, it's a problem when it gets to

1370
01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:48.540
be, you know, double digit levels. Um, BUT if

1371
01:08:48.549 --> 01:08:52.538
you look at, um, most of the period of

1372
01:08:52.548 --> 01:08:56.618
the, of the capitalist economies, there've only been a

1373
01:08:56.627 --> 01:09:00.298
handful of cases of hyperinflation and they were universally

1374
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:04.258
ones where productive facilities were destroyed before the government

1375
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:07.818
tried to compensate by increasing the rate of money

1376
01:09:07.828 --> 01:09:10.087
creation by the government. And then that led to

1377
01:09:10.099 --> 01:09:12.207
a, a spiral. So that as in, you know,

1378
01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:15.758
the classic being uh Germany uh when the via

1379
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:17.957
my Republic period after the first World War, well

1380
01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:20.898
before the second, well before the rise of Hitler,

1381
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:24.640
um they were hit impossible reparation terms, particularly by

1382
01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:27.419
the French and the Treaty of Versailles, they lost

1383
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.240
the Rua Valley, they lost so many productive resources.

1384
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.569
So hyperinflation occurred there trying to maintain people's capacity

1385
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.600
to buy with a destroyed production system that gave

1386
01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:41.649
us the Weimar Zimbabwe uh dis disenfranchising the white,

1387
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.979
the white farm owners that led to a collapse

1388
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.100
in supply. Uh Argentina's a, a mess of its

1389
01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:50.149
own making with enormous amounts of income going to

1390
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.149
the super rich and, and uh it a horrible

1391
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.419
situation in terms of land ownership. Um So those

1392
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:59.229
are the cases. But if you look at the,

1393
01:09:59.549 --> 01:10:04.299
the major economy that didn't suffer huge uh crashes

1394
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:07.240
in their productive capability, the highest rate of inflation

1395
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:10.299
we've seen is about 20%. And the dividing line

1396
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.149
I I with hyperinflation and normal inflation is actually

1397
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.240
about a 40% and between 30 40% there's almost

1398
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.970
no cases. Then there's a handful of those above

1399
01:10:18.979 --> 01:10:22.970
40%. Most are below 30%. Uh RATES of inflation.

1400
01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:25.390
A small amount of inflation is not a bad

1401
01:10:25.399 --> 01:10:28.319
thing. In fact, it's potentially a good thing because

1402
01:10:28.569 --> 01:10:31.520
that bur of, of, of inflation inspires you to

1403
01:10:31.529 --> 01:10:33.430
spend somewhat rather than hanging out of money and

1404
01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:35.720
seeing it fall in value, you're more likely to

1405
01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:37.520
spend it. So again, if we take a look

1406
01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:39.169
at the, at the, at the rate of turnover

1407
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.140
of money during the stable inflation days of the

1408
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:45.870
fifties and, and, and early to mid sixties, that

1409
01:10:45.879 --> 01:10:50.049
was 1.8 when the high inflation hit in the

1410
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.370
seventies, sixties, late, the early mid seventies to mid

1411
01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:58.020
eighties. Uh THE Volcker period uh when inflation hit

1412
01:10:58.029 --> 01:11:01.129
17% in America, the rate of turn of money

1413
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:05.520
rose to 3.5 times rather than 1.8. That's compensating

1414
01:11:05.899 --> 01:11:08.390
for the, you know, higher, higher pri uh rate

1415
01:11:08.399 --> 01:11:12.160
of inflation. Um BUT so a moderate amount of

1416
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:16.299
inflation encourage you to spend. And that is AAA

1417
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:21.520
positive benefit that money which is effectively falling in

1418
01:11:21.529 --> 01:11:25.209
value gives. And in fact, there's a, a non

1419
01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:29.600
orthodox Argentinian monetary theorist called Sil Silvio Gazelle who

1420
01:11:29.609 --> 01:11:33.160
argues that all money should depreciate the idea being

1421
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:35.459
if money's a hot potato, it gets transferred one

1422
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:39.779
person to another causing more economic activity. So there's,

1423
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:41.700
there's an argument that a small amount of inflation

1424
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:44.020
does that but too much inflation, you then start

1425
01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:47.290
getting uh what Phillips who first identified is called

1426
01:11:47.299 --> 01:11:49.910
a wage price spiral. And, and that is a

1427
01:11:49.919 --> 01:11:54.100
counterproductive syndrome. You want to control it um will

1428
01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:57.330
stop it. But generally speaking, inflation of the in

1429
01:11:57.339 --> 01:12:02.169
the range of of 0 to 7 10% even

1430
01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:04.890
is bearable. It's when it gets into double digits,

1431
01:12:04.899 --> 01:12:06.250
we start seeing problems.

1432
01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.569
So in a sort of related topic, how are

1433
01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.089
prices determined? What kinds of factors play a role

1434
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:15.620
in that?

1435
01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:18.770
I tend to work at the aggregate level. So

1436
01:12:18.779 --> 01:12:20.439
I'm not going to go down into, into detailed

1437
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.660
price setting, but I'll start from that point of

1438
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:24.689
view. In fact, because if you imagine bringing on

1439
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.089
a new product, like for example, an electric bicycle

1440
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.700
or electric car, uh you, you can work out

1441
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:32.850
what the components are needed to make that. So

1442
01:12:32.859 --> 01:12:34.810
you get all the, all the what we, what

1443
01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:37.049
we call variable cost, the metal, you've got to

1444
01:12:37.109 --> 01:12:40.149
buy the electricity, the labor and so on. And

1445
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.299
that gives you a price level. And then the

1446
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.770
question is, well, how many units can we expect

1447
01:12:44.779 --> 01:12:47.339
to sell? And what size factory do we need

1448
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:49.479
to make those units? Then you get your fixed

1449
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.220
costs which come out of that. And then your

1450
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:53.790
calculation is well, given the size of the market,

1451
01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:56.370
the segment we're selling into, can we expect to

1452
01:12:56.379 --> 01:12:59.560
break even uh or make a profit uh given

1453
01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:02.520
those fixed costs? And those considerations come through to

1454
01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:04.899
you determine what markup you can set. And you'll

1455
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:06.629
also look at, well, what's the, what's the current

1456
01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.319
markup? What are our competitors currently marking up the

1457
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.560
cost of electric car, etcetera, etcetera. So all those

1458
01:13:12.569 --> 01:13:15.100
calculations are at the micro level. Uh WHEN you

1459
01:13:15.109 --> 01:13:17.209
get at the macro level, you come down to

1460
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.640
that question of the markup. The, the markup is

1461
01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:22.939
what corporations set to uh get a profit out

1462
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:26.339
of selling its unit. Uh The the wage costs

1463
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:29.770
turn up. That's your major cost as a firm

1464
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.120
uh coming from not other firms, but where else

1465
01:13:33.129 --> 01:13:35.060
do you buy from? Predominantly you buy from households,

1466
01:13:35.069 --> 01:13:38.029
you buy labor. Uh And then as I said,

1467
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.439
the you, yeah, output per unit. So those are

1468
01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:43.069
the three ones. The Kalesi identified is Gilles price

1469
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.759
equation and the basic equation is the uh uh

1470
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:50.640
price level is 1/1 minus the markup multiplied by

1471
01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:53.430
the wage divided by output per worker. And then

1472
01:13:53.439 --> 01:13:54.970
when you put it in dynamic terms, you get

1473
01:13:54.979 --> 01:13:56.490
the rate of change of markups, the rate of

1474
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.729
change of money wages and the rate of change

1475
01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:01.060
of output per worker. Those are the three major

1476
01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:05.220
determinants of inflation at the macro level. And given

1477
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:07.450
that markups have been rising faster than the rate

1478
01:14:07.459 --> 01:14:11.700
of inflation over time. I've seen some neoclassical estimates

1479
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:13.930
which imply markups have gone from an average of

1480
01:14:13.939 --> 01:14:20.140
about 20% to 65% over the period from 1970

1481
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:22.509
to now. I intend redoing that work in a

1482
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.689
non neoclassical way at some point. But it implies

1483
01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.459
by far the major effect that causes the inflation

1484
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.020
is the is, is corporations fundamentally the capitalist class

1485
01:14:33.859 --> 01:14:35.709
getting a larger share of apple by putting up

1486
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.359
mockups, that's been the main cause of inflation. So

1487
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:41.390
we want to reduce that. Uh If you want

1488
01:14:41.399 --> 01:14:44.020
to reduce the rate of inflation, your primary target

1489
01:14:44.029 --> 01:14:46.549
is to reduce the markups that firms put on

1490
01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.439
their commodities.

1491
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.649
OK. So I I would like to ask you

1492
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.770
now a little bit about money and the role

1493
01:14:53.779 --> 01:14:57.470
of banks in the economic system because it, it

1494
01:14:57.479 --> 01:15:00.689
might be the case that people commonly have some

1495
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.970
misconceptions about these kinds of topics. And I would

1496
01:15:03.979 --> 01:15:07.845
really love who on this podcast go through them.

1497
01:15:08.024 --> 01:15:12.104
So uh how is money created actually? I mean,

1498
01:15:12.115 --> 01:15:17.044
is it just a government issuing new money through

1499
01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:21.625
the central bank or is it more complicated than

1500
01:15:21.634 --> 01:15:21.924
that?

1501
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:26.569
It's more complicated but also more simple. So there

1502
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.359
are two ways to create money in a capitalist

1503
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:31.180
economy. Banks lend out more money than they go

1504
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:34.810
back into repayments. That's how private banks create money.

1505
01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.169
And they do that by marking up both sides

1506
01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.810
of their ledger. So they, they put more money

1507
01:15:39.819 --> 01:15:42.220
in a private person's deposit account. They have a

1508
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:45.649
million euro to buy a house in Warsaw. Yeah.

1509
01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.529
Uh, AND they then record well, your, is precisely

1510
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.779
a million dollars more at the same time. So

1511
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:53.229
they mark up their assets and their liabilities. The

1512
01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.430
government creates money by spending more than it gets

1513
01:15:55.439 --> 01:15:57.790
back on taxation. And when you work out the,

1514
01:15:57.799 --> 01:15:59.799
uh, overall dynamics and I've built the only software

1515
01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.009
package in the world that can show that I

1516
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.229
call it Minsky and are happy to get people

1517
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.220
to download a copy of Minsky and try it

1518
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.709
out for themselves. When you look at how governments

1519
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.229
create money, they create money by going to negative

1520
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.120
financial equity. So the treasury spends more than it

1521
01:16:15.129 --> 01:16:19.209
gets back in, in taxation. And that spending a

1522
01:16:19.649 --> 01:16:22.640
adds to its negative equity in financial terms. So

1523
01:16:22.649 --> 01:16:25.700
it has more financial liability than it has financial

1524
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:28.649
assets. But in because in an overall system, the

1525
01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:32.060
sum of all financial assets and liabilities are zero,

1526
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:35.680
the government getting more negative financial equity means that

1527
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:39.040
the, the non government sector gets identical, positive financial

1528
01:16:39.049 --> 01:16:42.580
equity and that therefore the, that the government money

1529
01:16:42.589 --> 01:16:46.299
creation doesn't create any debt for the government because

1530
01:16:46.319 --> 01:16:49.229
if you had a a sensible system, the treasury

1531
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.089
could issue bonds and the central bank could buy

1532
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.169
them straight away. Uh So that's in, in that

1533
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.819
case, the, the, the gov the government debt would

1534
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.919
be owned by the government. OK? Which is a,

1535
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:01.049
which is a point that we can't do that.

1536
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.810
You can't, household debt can't be owned by the

1537
01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.319
household. Ok. If you're a million dollars in debt,

1538
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.979
you can ask your wife to pay it, pay

1539
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.919
it out for you. Ok, you're a million dollars

1540
01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:12.040
in debt to the bank. And, uh, you've got

1541
01:17:12.049 --> 01:17:14.149
to satisfy the bank's need for the money and,

1542
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:16.129
you know, your wife can't say, well, I'll take

1543
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.879
it over for you. Just not possible. So, uh,

1544
01:17:20.009 --> 01:17:25.339
government, government's uh money creation doesn't have to involve

1545
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:29.620
uh selling bonds to any private sector. It's only

1546
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:33.000
laws that require that which were drafted by politicians

1547
01:17:33.009 --> 01:17:35.939
and economists who don't understand the monetary system. But

1548
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:40.200
punchline the the pri the private sector creates money

1549
01:17:40.209 --> 01:17:43.439
by expanding in its assets and liabilities identically which

1550
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.419
the banking sector can do. The government creates money

1551
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.819
by creating net financial assets for the non-government sector.

1552
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.819
And that necessarily means net financial liabilities for it.

1553
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:56.259
So just to see if I get this right?

1554
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:59.509
And in more simple terms, so when it comes

1555
01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.799
to the banks, whenever a bank lends money to

1556
01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:08.649
a private person, I is it creating new money

1557
01:18:08.899 --> 01:18:09.450
or not?

1558
01:18:10.589 --> 01:18:13.890
Yes, it is. And the mainstream ignore this. They

1559
01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:15.870
they want to argue that the banks are what

1560
01:18:15.879 --> 01:18:18.609
they call intermediaries. The banks supposedly just take money

1561
01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.899
from savers and lend it out to borrowers again.

1562
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.279
That is nonsense. And uh a non mainstream group

1563
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:27.160
of economists have been saying that right, since Joseph

1564
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.970
Sean payer and even earlier than that back in

1565
01:18:28.979 --> 01:18:31.979
the 18 hundreds. Um BUT the mainstream has been

1566
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:34.330
ignoring that all the way through and they continued

1567
01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:37.049
ignoring it until the bank. Pardon me? The Bank

1568
01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.609
of England came out in 2014 said the heretics

1569
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.720
are right, banks create money when they lend the

1570
01:18:42.729 --> 01:18:44.979
Bundesbank said the same thing. And what did the

1571
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:48.839
mainstream do? Ignored it? Yeah, they just don't wanna

1572
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.149
when you, when you challenge the paradigm and this

1573
01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.089
is the paradigm, challenging component, they don't even want

1574
01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.770
to engage with you. So you'd imagine that when

1575
01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:00.479
they gave a Nobel Prize in Economics to Ben

1576
01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:04.930
Bernanke in 2022 which is not a Nobel Prize.

1577
01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:06.540
It's something that was made up by the Swedish

1578
01:19:06.549 --> 01:19:10.109
Central Bank and called after Nobel. Uh WHEN they

1579
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.859
did that, you'd think they'd acknowledged the Bank of

1580
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:14.370
England and the Bundesbank. But in their so called

1581
01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:17.450
scientific document for giving the money to Bernanke and

1582
01:19:17.459 --> 01:19:20.700
his two fellow neoclassical, they did not even cite

1583
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:23.140
the Bank of England or the Bundesbank, they just

1584
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:27.060
ignore the whole damn thing. So it, it, it's

1585
01:19:27.069 --> 01:19:29.930
incredibly wrong to do that because banks create money

1586
01:19:29.939 --> 01:19:31.180
when they lend. And then when you take a

1587
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:34.129
look at the consequences of that, you find that

1588
01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.740
every last major crisis in capitalism has been caused

1589
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.830
by a private debt bubble. But the mainstream says

1590
01:19:41.839 --> 01:19:44.879
private debt doesn't matter. They've had no explanation and

1591
01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:47.859
no warning of any of the crises, capitalism has

1592
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:51.470
experienced in its last 1.5 centuries because they ignore

1593
01:19:51.479 --> 01:19:52.529
the primary course.

1594
01:19:54.049 --> 01:19:58.350
But then for the purposes of understanding money creation

1595
01:19:58.359 --> 01:20:02.580
and for the economy, more general, more generally, there's

1596
01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:07.009
a difference between credit and fiat money. Right.

1597
01:20:07.649 --> 01:20:12.299
Yeah, credit money is money that banks create when

1598
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:14.520
you borrow from them. And if you borrow from

1599
01:20:14.529 --> 01:20:18.310
a bank, fundamentally, your net financial assets remain constant

1600
01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.120
because the, the increase in your uh, money in

1601
01:20:21.129 --> 01:20:23.479
your bank account is perfectly offset by the increase

1602
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.919
in debt that you owe to the bank. So

1603
01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:28.859
that private individuals get no increase in their um

1604
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:31.950
personal equity out of borrowing. Why do they do

1605
01:20:31.959 --> 01:20:33.629
it? It's because they think they can buy a

1606
01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.990
non-financial asset, things like a factory or a house

1607
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.919
uh and see an increase in, in monetary value

1608
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.160
and make a profit out of that. That's why

1609
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:45.750
we do it with government money creation. The government

1610
01:20:45.759 --> 01:20:48.430
spends more than gets back in taxation that creates

1611
01:20:48.439 --> 01:20:49.950
money we get in a bank account with no

1612
01:20:49.959 --> 01:20:53.149
additional debt for us attached to it. So for

1613
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.220
the recipient of net government spending, it's, it's money

1614
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:59.830
without uh without debt and that tends to be

1615
01:20:59.839 --> 01:21:04.330
spent more freely. So, unfortunately, because economists wrongly think

1616
01:21:04.339 --> 01:21:06.479
that government debt matters and private debt does not,

1617
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.629
they've encouraged too much private money and not enough

1618
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.790
government money creation.

1619
01:21:10.529 --> 01:21:15.049
Mhm. And would it be possible for government to

1620
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.109
take on the role of banks and uh government

1621
01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:23.609
being the only institution creating money or is that

1622
01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:24.700
not possible

1623
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:27.680
at all? It's, it's possible. Um, I mean, I've,

1624
01:21:27.689 --> 01:21:30.350
I have problems about whether that would work or

1625
01:21:30.359 --> 01:21:35.319
not. Um, BECAUSE you, uh governments tend to centralize,

1626
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.720
just like banks tend to centralize now and the

1627
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:40.770
more you centralize, the less, you know. Um So

1628
01:21:40.779 --> 01:21:42.750
what you actually want a more distributed system for

1629
01:21:42.759 --> 01:21:45.359
banking? So, Richard Werner, who's the, you know, a

1630
01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:50.089
German expert on, on, on banking, uh favors the

1631
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.310
German system where you have lots of small regional

1632
01:21:52.319 --> 01:21:54.979
banks and often they'll be community banks of various

1633
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:57.549
sorts rather than for profits. And they tend to

1634
01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.250
be low, close to the community and they can

1635
01:21:59.259 --> 01:22:01.819
work out who's a good uh credit risk and

1636
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.450
who's not, what's a decent product and what's not,

1637
01:22:04.459 --> 01:22:07.040
you want that distributed system. So it'd be possible

1638
01:22:07.049 --> 01:22:09.000
to have a government system in there. But I'd

1639
01:22:09.009 --> 01:22:11.200
want to have some way that you had private

1640
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:13.529
judgment coming in to decide who got the money

1641
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:17.240
and who didn't. And that's organizations like positive money

1642
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:20.379
UK, which I'm on the advisory board to, they

1643
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:22.310
often recommend that sort of system and that the

1644
01:22:22.319 --> 01:22:24.459
government should create the, the bulk of the money.

1645
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:26.319
But then you try to get the private private

1646
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:28.220
banks to decide who gets it and who doesn't

1647
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:31.890
in terms of loans. Uh Again, as much as

1648
01:22:31.899 --> 01:22:33.470
I think that's more appealing than what we do

1649
01:22:33.479 --> 01:22:35.240
at the moment, you also have to work out

1650
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.720
well. Could banks be profitable if they don't have

1651
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:40.160
the capacity to create money? That would mean you

1652
01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:42.560
have to limit uh banks to having a set

1653
01:22:42.569 --> 01:22:44.640
fund out of which they lend the whole idea

1654
01:22:44.649 --> 01:22:47.080
that banks create money out of nothing, doesn't mean

1655
01:22:47.089 --> 01:22:49.479
they waive a wand and create money. What it

1656
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:51.939
means is there's no other account out of which

1657
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:54.830
they're taking funds to lend to you. Now, if

1658
01:22:54.839 --> 01:22:56.370
you set up a system where that did happen

1659
01:22:56.379 --> 01:22:59.870
and it's quite feasible to do that. Um THEN

1660
01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.879
it might be that the arbitrage by charging a

1661
01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:05.560
higher interest rate on their lending out than they

1662
01:23:05.569 --> 01:23:07.720
get. Uh THEY have to pay for the funds

1663
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:10.810
in this lender loan fund system. If you do

1664
01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.250
that, that might not be profitable and you don't

1665
01:23:13.259 --> 01:23:15.930
want a capitalist economy without a profitable banking sector

1666
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:19.479
because it's, it's fundamentally a monetary system. So I'm,

1667
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:22.410
I'm a bit ambivalent. I would rather have private

1668
01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:25.259
uh money creation as well as government money creation,

1669
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:27.160
but I'd have strict limits on what that money

1670
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:30.020
can be created for, to rule out speculation and

1671
01:23:30.029 --> 01:23:33.750
focus upon long-term consumption for the household sector and

1672
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:37.279
working capital and investment capital for the corporate sector.

1673
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.080
OK. So uh let me ask you this question.

1674
01:23:41.089 --> 01:23:44.049
I might be missing something here and if I

1675
01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.390
say something wrong, please correct me. But uh when

1676
01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:52.379
it comes to credit money, then what actually then

1677
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:55.220
gives value to it. I mean, is it, uh,

1678
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:59.629
the way the person it gets, uh, lent to,

1679
01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.350
is going to spend it on the economy or,

1680
01:24:02.359 --> 01:24:05.089
or is it that though? I, I mean, that

1681
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.089
that person has to work to then earn that

1682
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.669
money for wages to pay it back? I mean,

1683
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.810
what exactly is, is then giving value to that

1684
01:24:15.819 --> 01:24:16.270
money?

1685
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:18.350
Well, you have to have the money being spared.

1686
01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.870
Um, PEOPLE often make a confusion. They think, well,

1687
01:24:21.879 --> 01:24:24.120
if you borrow $100 from the bank and they're

1688
01:24:24.129 --> 01:24:26.859
charging 5% they give you 100 you've gotta pack

1689
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.839
100 and five. It's unsustainable, it must collapse. That's

1690
01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:31.589
only unsustainable. If you don't spend the money you've

1691
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.819
borrowed. Now, what happens tends to happen if you

1692
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:38.520
borrow 100 uh, you spend $200 per year. So

1693
01:24:38.529 --> 01:24:40.029
you spend the money at a rate of, you

1694
01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.859
know, two times per year, you pay 100 and

1695
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:48.020
60 towards your suppliers and that includes uh wages,

1696
01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.060
you pay, let's say 10% interest to the bank.

1697
01:24:51.069 --> 01:24:53.600
So you pay them $10 you get 30 in

1698
01:24:53.609 --> 01:24:58.580
profit. So if the money is enabling turnover and

1699
01:24:58.589 --> 01:25:01.459
economic activity, you can finance that level of debt.

1700
01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:04.350
And the fact you're paying interest on it isn't,

1701
01:25:04.359 --> 01:25:06.830
isn't, doesn't mean that the interest gets added to

1702
01:25:06.839 --> 01:25:10.419
the principle that only happens if you don't spend

1703
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:12.910
the money. Now, nobody borrows for the sheer pleasure

1704
01:25:12.919 --> 01:25:15.759
of being in debt. Uh, PEOPLE can borrow for

1705
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:18.600
ventures that don't work and therefore they can't pay

1706
01:25:18.609 --> 01:25:20.240
the debt back and they go bankrupt in the

1707
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.689
firm. The bank lends loses the money that they

1708
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.149
created for them. That's quite feasible. They might also

1709
01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.500
gain the assets, the route, the non financial assets

1710
01:25:28.509 --> 01:25:31.060
that were built using that money and they can

1711
01:25:31.069 --> 01:25:33.660
then sell them on the secondary market. So it's,

1712
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:35.479
it's a more complicated system than just as I

1713
01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:39.850
as I've implied it. Um BUT fundamentally, money works

1714
01:25:39.859 --> 01:25:43.580
if money is spent and a private, so you

1715
01:25:43.589 --> 01:25:46.569
could have a functional private money system with no

1716
01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:50.089
government money creation at all. But what that tends

1717
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:52.549
to do is in that we've seen this historically,

1718
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:56.109
whenever the level of government money creation plunges, the

1719
01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.350
the private sector tends to do more, more borrowing

1720
01:25:59.359 --> 01:26:02.609
and gambling on financial assets. And the reason is

1721
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.459
that when you look at the banking sector, banks

1722
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:08.390
must have positive equity, a bank's assets must exceed

1723
01:26:08.399 --> 01:26:12.640
its liabilities, short-term assets, short-term liabilities is always a

1724
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:16.479
maturity matching issue when you talk about debt. But

1725
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:19.810
a bank which has more short-term liabilities than short-term

1726
01:26:19.819 --> 01:26:23.029
assets is bankrupt. So therefore, the banking sector in

1727
01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.399
the aggregate has more financial assets than liabilities. That

1728
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:30.259
means the non-bank financial sector, if there is not

1729
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:33.759
a government must have more financial liabilities and assets.

1730
01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:36.410
Now, if you think about, if you had a

1731
01:26:36.419 --> 01:26:39.500
system like that and corporations and households are both

1732
01:26:39.509 --> 01:26:43.600
in negative equity, then they're gonna be tempted to

1733
01:26:43.609 --> 01:26:46.279
borrow money from a bank which doesn't change the

1734
01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:49.490
level of an equity equity by a non-financial asset

1735
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.189
like a house or a share, see it rise

1736
01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.770
in value and then notionally regard their equity as

1737
01:26:54.779 --> 01:26:57.950
now being positive. In other words, a government trying

1738
01:26:57.959 --> 01:27:02.569
to eliminate its level of debt ends up encouraging

1739
01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.120
the private sector to get into financial bubbles. And

1740
01:27:05.129 --> 01:27:07.470
that's what we saw during the 19th century. Every

1741
01:27:07.479 --> 01:27:09.500
10 to 15 years, there was a financial bubble

1742
01:27:09.509 --> 01:27:12.359
and crash and and that is not a healthy

1743
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:15.569
system. So you you it is preferable to have

1744
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:18.310
government money creation to the stage at which both

1745
01:27:18.319 --> 01:27:21.310
banks and the non-bank private sector can be in

1746
01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:24.859
positive financial equity while the government carries the negative

1747
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:27.009
financial equity that it's got every capacity in the

1748
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.790
world to handle.

1749
01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:31.919
Mhm. So let me ask you now, uh this

1750
01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:34.779
is something that I actually want to ask you

1751
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:37.290
about because I read about it in your work.

1752
01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:39.629
It's a very interesting thing and another sort of

1753
01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.600
misconception that people tend to have. What is GDP

1754
01:27:44.609 --> 01:27:50.140
exactly when people refer to GDP, what goals attached

1755
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:52.770
to it in terms of uh I mean, what

1756
01:27:52.779 --> 01:27:54.930
generates GDP,

1757
01:27:55.009 --> 01:27:57.810
let's say it's fundamentally adding up all the flows

1758
01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:00.220
of goods and services in an economy over a

1759
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:05.299
year and therefore it's anything newly produced and newly

1760
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:10.509
sold, it's not um houses which existing houses, the

1761
01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.459
sale of an existing house does not add to

1762
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.899
GDP, but then it's the flow of new goods

1763
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:18.890
and services coming out of a productive eco productive

1764
01:28:18.899 --> 01:28:21.700
facilities of an economy over a year. And the,

1765
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:22.859
the only way you can add them up is

1766
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:26.080
by the money value. Now, that therefore means you

1767
01:28:26.089 --> 01:28:29.439
have um you know, you're adding, you know, um

1768
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:34.549
microphones to coffee cups. OK? Um So it's a,

1769
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.120
it's a very uh lumpy aggregation of very different

1770
01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:41.680
things. The intriguing thing that I have found when

1771
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:45.120
I look at the global data is that when

1772
01:28:45.129 --> 01:28:49.069
you look at global GDP and global energy consumption,

1773
01:28:49.259 --> 01:28:54.259
they're almost the same thing fundamentally what GDP is

1774
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.160
energy, which we find in the universe for free.

1775
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:59.609
Fundamentally, we didn't, we didn't create the oil and

1776
01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.399
gas and, and uranium and sunlight that we find

1777
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:06.029
in the universe. It's just there, we take advantage

1778
01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.399
of it. Uh And we then transform it into

1779
01:29:08.419 --> 01:29:11.640
a more useful formal forms. So, you know, wind

1780
01:29:11.649 --> 01:29:15.540
outside from the, from the environment becomes heating inside

1781
01:29:15.549 --> 01:29:17.939
your house, that sort of thing. So you take

1782
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:19.810
energy in one form and convert it to another

1783
01:29:19.819 --> 01:29:22.629
one. You must have losses. That's where the laws

1784
01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.129
of thermodynamics come in. So you lose energy in

1785
01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.549
that process or you have energy which is no

1786
01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.600
longer available for use. Uh But useful, converting free

1787
01:29:32.609 --> 01:29:36.009
energy free inverts as we didn't create it to

1788
01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.950
useful work is what creates GDP and a fit

1789
01:29:38.959 --> 01:29:42.229
between two is almost like a glove. So uh

1790
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.689
fundamentally, even though GDP is a, you know, horrible

1791
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.990
aggregate of things which are very different and microphones

1792
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.770
and coffee cups uh at the level of aggregate

1793
01:29:51.779 --> 01:29:55.180
level of production, what you find is that fundamentally

1794
01:29:55.339 --> 01:29:58.410
GDP measures the amount of energy we've turned into

1795
01:29:58.419 --> 01:29:59.930
useful work for ourselves.

1796
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:04.700
Mhm. But is it the case that a at

1797
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:08.450
least the way that uh governments and other institutions

1798
01:30:08.459 --> 01:30:12.770
tend to work out for GDP would also include,

1799
01:30:13.089 --> 01:30:17.209
I don't know, perhaps money that is not attached

1800
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:21.529
to um, the things that are actually valuable or

1801
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.609
productive. Uh I don't know.

1802
01:30:24.359 --> 01:30:26.379
Oh, there's a lot of, you know, we, we

1803
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:29.979
produce garbage two ways about it and, and we,

1804
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:31.979
and we over price, you know, like a Louis

1805
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:35.379
Vuitton handbag. II, I don't think it's costs, you

1806
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:38.709
know, a, a handbag costs more than my computer.

1807
01:30:39.029 --> 01:30:40.529
And I've seen enough of those because my wife

1808
01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:44.450
likes buying handbags. Um, YOU know, it's, it's pretty

1809
01:30:44.459 --> 01:30:47.180
insane. So we put a huge value, a huge

1810
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:49.779
price on things with no value. And that, that

1811
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:52.830
is a fundamental problem in the, and the more

1812
01:30:52.839 --> 01:30:54.729
elite consumption we have, the more that tends to

1813
01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.899
happen. I saw a video clip through Twitter a

1814
01:30:56.910 --> 01:31:00.160
couple of days ago of some corporation in America

1815
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:05.160
making a, uh a submarine for high end consumers

1816
01:31:05.169 --> 01:31:07.009
to go and take a look at depths of

1817
01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.160
up to 200 m. Um It's a great piece

1818
01:31:11.169 --> 01:31:14.830
of technology, but it's, it's designed for an uber

1819
01:31:14.839 --> 01:31:16.890
wealthy can afford a fortune to go on a

1820
01:31:16.899 --> 01:31:19.750
Submersible vehicle, which is also apparently a high, you

1821
01:31:19.759 --> 01:31:22.149
know, it's a high speed boat as well as

1822
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.939
a submarine. I think even a plane. This crazy

1823
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:28.859
combination. That is a sign of how unequal the

1824
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:31.240
distribution of income is that the wealthy have that

1825
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.399
much income to wake on based on what is

1826
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:35.459
for them frivolous. The fact that a wealthy person

1827
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:38.140
sees his octopus at 200 m is not a

1828
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:41.180
particularly great social contribution. So we do have an

1829
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:43.959
enormous amount of wasteful stuff in there. But again,

1830
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:46.819
what that reflects is the distribution of income. And

1831
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:50.470
GDP completely ignores the distribution of income. So to

1832
01:31:50.479 --> 01:31:52.979
focus upon GDP alone and say that rising is

1833
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:56.270
a good thing is ignoring how distorted the distribution

1834
01:31:56.279 --> 01:31:58.939
of income has become. And there's no way that

1835
01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:01.700
that the change between the 19 sixties and now

1836
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:03.919
have been a massive shift of income towards the

1837
01:32:03.930 --> 01:32:06.580
wealthy. So the fact that GDP has risen is

1838
01:32:06.589 --> 01:32:09.180
irrelevant for most people because if you broke it

1839
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:12.870
into GDP, receive goods and services received by the

1840
01:32:12.879 --> 01:32:16.149
poor parts of society or poor to like even

1841
01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.060
the even the bottom 90% that has risen trivially

1842
01:32:20.069 --> 01:32:21.660
compared to the amount that's going to the top

1843
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:24.290
10. So I would like to see a distributional

1844
01:32:24.299 --> 01:32:27.490
measure added to GDP as well as the actual

1845
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.439
raw number and that is not done by any

1846
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:31.310
country in the world, unfortunately.

1847
01:32:32.069 --> 01:32:36.540
But is there any metric that, I mean, just

1848
01:32:36.549 --> 01:32:40.109
institutions or governments or people tend to use that

1849
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:45.839
would give us that income distribution information within

1850
01:32:46.299 --> 01:32:48.569
the data. The data is hard to get because

1851
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:50.890
people can see how much they earn and you

1852
01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:53.529
and I don't, but, you know, Jeff Bezos does.

1853
01:32:53.799 --> 01:32:56.140
So it, it's hard to get the income from

1854
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:58.000
the top level. But yeah, the, we have a

1855
01:32:58.009 --> 01:33:00.080
rough idea of that and you can certainly find

1856
01:33:00.089 --> 01:33:03.870
data on the distribution of income. Uh OR I

1857
01:33:03.879 --> 01:33:05.549
mean, the best data has actually been put together

1858
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.060
by one of my good friends, uh Jamie Galbraith,

1859
01:33:08.069 --> 01:33:10.419
the son of John Kenneth Galbraith and his is

1860
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:13.240
what's called a teal, a teal distribution to work

1861
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:15.430
out distribution of income, not just at the national

1862
01:33:15.439 --> 01:33:18.000
level, even down to local government areas. So it

1863
01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.410
can be done and it should be part of

1864
01:33:19.419 --> 01:33:22.279
what national stats do. And we should really have

1865
01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:25.520
the focus upon enabling the poorest people to have

1866
01:33:25.529 --> 01:33:27.899
the greatest increase in income. This is one reason

1867
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:30.879
China's been so successful because that's what it's done.

1868
01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:33.479
Uh There were some very wealthy individuals in China,

1869
01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:35.609
but they've also put some billionaires behind bars at

1870
01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.560
various times. We never do that in the West

1871
01:33:38.649 --> 01:33:40.899
uh for, for what they see as bad behavior.

1872
01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:42.720
Uh AND the, and the standard of living of

1873
01:33:42.729 --> 01:33:46.609
ordinary China has risen stupendously over the last 40

1874
01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.290
years. Whereas across the same time period, the working

1875
01:33:49.299 --> 01:33:53.209
class in America and Europe has, if they're lucky,

1876
01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:55.850
tried water, they've got more sophisticated devices now than

1877
01:33:55.859 --> 01:33:58.649
they had back then. They're massively more in debt.

1878
01:33:58.879 --> 01:34:02.479
Uh They have far fewer prospects of educational advancement

1879
01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:06.879
and so on. So the, the, the supposed performance

1880
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.029
of the Western GDP terms is illusory, whereas performance

1881
01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.450
of GDP in China has been quite successful.

1882
01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.000
So I I mean, perhaps the level of importance

1883
01:34:17.009 --> 01:34:20.540
that people tend to attach to GB DP alone

1884
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:24.220
is overblown, right? I mean, because it's perfectly possible

1885
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:28.180
for GDP in a particular country, for example, to

1886
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:32.620
go up over time but still life for even

1887
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:36.259
the majority of people living there, uh standards of

1888
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:39.580
living actually going down at least a little bit.

1889
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:41.799
Yeah, like America, that's one reason why I think

1890
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:45.540
something like that for Donald Trump, they've had 50

1891
01:34:45.549 --> 01:34:48.180
years of that happening ever since America started outsourcing

1892
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:51.520
production to third world countries. And like my favorite

1893
01:34:51.529 --> 01:34:53.509
example, there is what I learned personally when I

1894
01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.870
went on a trip to China in 81 with

1895
01:34:55.879 --> 01:34:58.529
a group of journalists doing a uh a seminar

1896
01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:01.709
with Chinese journalists and then visiting various parts of

1897
01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.479
China on a study tour. Um WE uh went

1898
01:35:05.490 --> 01:35:08.200
to the Shenzhen free trade zone which is just

1899
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:11.000
outside Hong Kong as it was being built before

1900
01:35:11.009 --> 01:35:14.390
it even took the first customer. And the II

1901
01:35:14.399 --> 01:35:16.720
I knew China was gonna succeed when I saw

1902
01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:21.209
that particular facility because the managers explained that any

1903
01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.759
American corporation was hap was uh happy to set

1904
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:28.200
up in that uh trade zone. So long as

1905
01:35:28.209 --> 01:35:31.149
a they had a Chinese partner and b within

1906
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.259
five years, whatever amount of capital the Chinese partner

1907
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:37.040
put into the business within five years, the Chinese

1908
01:35:37.049 --> 01:35:41.100
partner owned 50% of the business. Now, I was

1909
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:44.020
just stunned when I heard those numbers and thought,

1910
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:47.310
what American corporation is going to agree to this?

1911
01:35:47.319 --> 01:35:50.370
The answer is any work American corporation that reckons

1912
01:35:50.379 --> 01:35:53.049
is gonna do better by paying Chinese workers low

1913
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.910
wages rather than paying American workers high ones. And

1914
01:35:55.919 --> 01:35:57.930
that's what happened over time. The Fox one and

1915
01:35:57.939 --> 01:36:00.899
all those corporations came out of that process. So

1916
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:04.620
China, the Chinese uh communists knew that they were

1917
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:08.419
uh importing, not just American technology, they were creating

1918
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:10.620
a capitalist class at the same time, partly out

1919
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:12.399
of their caves and partly out of some of

1920
01:36:12.410 --> 01:36:15.810
the firm firm managers. And they were deliberately setting

1921
01:36:15.819 --> 01:36:19.370
up a capitalist economy inside China while also grabbing

1922
01:36:19.379 --> 01:36:22.879
American technology. And the fact that American corporations would

1923
01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:24.979
agree to that just shows how different the wages

1924
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:27.399
must be. I don't remember what wages were for

1925
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.140
American workers back in 1980 let's say, were a

1926
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:32.859
$2 an hour. Well, they must have been paying

1927
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.700
Chinese workers, you know, 20 cents an hour and

1928
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:40.379
then by reducing their wage costs. So dramatically. Uh

1929
01:36:40.979 --> 01:36:44.770
HALF the having half the firm, which is what

1930
01:36:44.779 --> 01:36:47.520
was required by the deal was more profitable than

1931
01:36:47.529 --> 01:36:50.009
owning 100%. If the workers you were paying were

1932
01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.540
Chinese rather than American. So that was what decimated

1933
01:36:53.549 --> 01:36:58.620
America's productive capability. It destroyed Detroit, it turned, they

1934
01:36:58.629 --> 01:37:01.229
created what we call the rust belt where factories

1935
01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.709
were shut down because there's no point shipping the

1936
01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.580
machinery. You, you put new technology over in China

1937
01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:09.930
and, and ship the goods back and that was

1938
01:37:09.939 --> 01:37:12.640
really what screwed the working class in America. It

1939
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:15.609
turned them against the Democrats. Democrats let that sort

1940
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:18.729
of thing happen. So it, it's a very destructive

1941
01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.330
thing to do. Um BUT that's typical, I mean,

1942
01:37:22.339 --> 01:37:25.759
American capitalists, uh they have no real regard for

1943
01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:29.819
their own workers and China which did have regard

1944
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:31.939
for its own workers, did that to get the

1945
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:34.529
technology. And now what you find is the skill

1946
01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:37.660
level in China far exceeds that in America. So

1947
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:40.850
the interesting innovations and new patents are coming out

1948
01:37:40.859 --> 01:37:42.060
of China, not America.

1949
01:37:43.509 --> 01:37:46.180
So in a way related to what you just

1950
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:49.759
explained there, could you tell us about this concept

1951
01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:54.660
that you use in your work? Financial capitalism? What

1952
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:55.540
does that mean?

1953
01:37:56.529 --> 01:37:59.450
It finally means that banks and non bank, financial

1954
01:37:59.459 --> 01:38:04.680
institutions, superannuation firms, insurance, uh or real estate, etcetera,

1955
01:38:04.689 --> 01:38:07.379
etcetera. There's actually a division of the American statistics

1956
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:11.000
called fire finance insurance and real estate. And when

1957
01:38:11.009 --> 01:38:14.060
Copeland put the tables together the national income and

1958
01:38:14.069 --> 01:38:17.569
production accounts way back in the forties and fifties.

1959
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:20.120
Um He just basically said, well, we can measure

1960
01:38:20.129 --> 01:38:23.680
the output of the manufacturing sector. You know, they

1961
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:26.299
sell goods with a price attached to them so

1962
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:28.629
we can work out what the output is of

1963
01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:31.040
those sectors. What about the finance sector? What are

1964
01:38:31.049 --> 01:38:34.479
they selling? Well, they're selling a service, often extra

1965
01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:36.919
levels of debt. You can't record the increase in

1966
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:39.629
debt as the output. So the way the the

1967
01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.490
output of the fire sector was measured was by

1968
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.419
adding up the wages and profits as if those

1969
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:46.879
wages and profits were equivalent to wages and profits

1970
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:49.330
in the finan in in the in the uh

1971
01:38:49.339 --> 01:38:54.100
industrial sector. Now that means paying, paying a if

1972
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:56.919
you increase the salary of the the boss of

1973
01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:00.089
Morgan Stanley by 10 million GDP goes up by

1974
01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:03.779
10 million. Yeah. Mhm. Very different. Or if you

1975
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:07.140
have general motors producing more cars, more cars are

1976
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:10.589
produced $10 million extra output turns up as goods

1977
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.649
and service c circulating in the economy, the finance

1978
01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.209
sector should be limited to the role of creating

1979
01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:20.870
the money that the uh industrial sector needs to

1980
01:39:20.879 --> 01:39:26.359
finance investment and pro and production. And that used

1981
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:29.000
to be the case uh after the second world

1982
01:39:29.009 --> 01:39:34.279
war because the the Great Depression and the second

1983
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:36.899
world war was such a huge shock to the

1984
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:40.129
system that the emphasis became on making sure the

1985
01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:42.790
workers, the ones who had often fought the wars

1986
01:39:42.799 --> 01:39:45.180
came back and had a decent lifestyle, a decent

1987
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:47.580
standard of living. And the finance sector was the

1988
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:52.040
servant of the industrial sector, not the boss as

1989
01:39:52.049 --> 01:39:54.490
the level of private debt rose over time. And

1990
01:39:54.529 --> 01:39:58.379
we focus more upon financial speculation rather than industrial

1991
01:39:58.390 --> 01:40:01.040
production. You get the finance sector being the boss

1992
01:40:01.049 --> 01:40:04.040
and the industrial sector being the servant. And that

1993
01:40:04.049 --> 01:40:07.399
is a recipe disaster. Cos as Mars himself said,

1994
01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:11.500
dec a century ago, a century beforehand, uh this,

1995
01:40:11.509 --> 01:40:14.399
this crowd knows nothing about production and should have

1996
01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:16.220
nothing to do with it. So you get a

1997
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:19.520
corrupted system coming out when the financial sector dominates.

1998
01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:22.200
And e even though I think the financial sector

1999
01:40:22.209 --> 01:40:24.990
is massively important in a, in a capitalist economy,

2000
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.930
if you don't understand it, you don't understand capitalism.

2001
01:40:28.009 --> 01:40:29.290
At the same time, I want to limit the

2002
01:40:29.299 --> 01:40:31.569
power of the financial sector and make of the

2003
01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:35.350
industrial sector front bad billing because the one thing

2004
01:40:35.359 --> 01:40:38.399
which you can really say defends capitalism against all

2005
01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:41.040
other social systems is the level of innovation it

2006
01:40:41.049 --> 01:40:46.060
causes in production and that innovation comes out of

2007
01:40:46.069 --> 01:40:50.629
engineers. Uh AND, and the competitive pressures in a

2008
01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.240
real market and those competitive pressures are what give

2009
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.229
us the change in technology we've seen over time.

2010
01:40:57.459 --> 01:40:59.419
And that is, is, you know, the the positive

2011
01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:01.390
benefit of capitalism when you give it to the

2012
01:41:01.399 --> 01:41:03.709
financial sector, they find different ways to entice us

2013
01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:06.620
to take our debt. They're not doing anything. They're

2014
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:10.000
actually more after a certain stage, they're more vampires

2015
01:41:10.009 --> 01:41:11.310
than they are blood donors.

2016
01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:16.529
So, I, I might be putting these into simplistic

2017
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.930
terms and perhaps a little bit, I don't know,

2018
01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:22.410
misleading but, uh, it seems to me then that

2019
01:41:22.419 --> 01:41:28.209
financial capitalism is pretty much about trying to generate

2020
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:33.450
money from money instead of having money attached to

2021
01:41:33.459 --> 01:41:39.000
actually the creation of, uh, valuable things, goods, services

2022
01:41:39.009 --> 01:41:40.770
and other things like that.

2023
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.290
Yeah, that's fairly realistic. I think if you actually

2024
01:41:44.299 --> 01:41:45.600
if you go and see the Wolf of Wall

2025
01:41:45.609 --> 01:41:47.279
Street to get an idea of what the finance

2026
01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:49.890
sector actually does and that's much more realistic than

2027
01:41:49.899 --> 01:41:50.970
any economic text book,

2028
01:41:52.419 --> 01:41:55.259
right? So uh doctor can do, do you think

2029
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:57.200
that we still have time perhaps to get a

2030
01:41:57.209 --> 01:42:00.180
little bit into climate change? There is another

2031
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:02.229
one of your interest?

2032
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:06.330
Ok. So um I mean, you've been of course,

2033
01:42:06.339 --> 01:42:11.109
also focused particularly recently on the issue of climate

2034
01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.750
change. So why is climate change not only environmentally

2035
01:42:16.759 --> 01:42:20.790
but also economically such a big issue?

2036
01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.859
Because we have a, we, we are actually a

2037
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:29.009
nomadic species that is now living a sedentary lifestyle

2038
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.109
and that sedentary lifestyle only became possible the temperatures

2039
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.589
of the called the holocene period because when you

2040
01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.310
look at the temperature history of the planet, uh

2041
01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:43.140
we only evolved about 300,000 years ago with the

2042
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:46.240
planet's been around for, you know, at, at least

2043
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:49.459
uh 4 billion years. So we, we're tiny fracture

2044
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:51.660
of the history of the planet in that particular

2045
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:54.620
history. There's been what are called Milankovic cycles that

2046
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:58.060
dominate the global temperature and they are cycles in

2047
01:42:58.069 --> 01:43:02.129
the temperature caused by oscillations in the earth's cycles

2048
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.290
around the, around the sun and they give you

2049
01:43:05.799 --> 01:43:09.419
peak uh peaks and troughs lasting about 100,000 years.

2050
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.459
We built our industrial civilization on one of the

2051
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:15.459
peaks. So temperatures six degrees warmer now than it

2052
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:17.959
was during the ice age. Ice ages tend to

2053
01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:21.259
last for about 60,000 years in interglacial, which is

2054
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:24.839
what we're in right now. Last for about 40,000

2055
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:27.580
years where there's a, a sort of 15,000 years

2056
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:30.310
of rising 15,000 years of falling. And at the

2057
01:43:30.319 --> 01:43:33.609
turnover point, you've got about 10,000 years of stability.

2058
01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:38.020
So we built our entire system on that 10,000

2059
01:43:38.029 --> 01:43:40.839
year peak. Now, if we hadn't, so pumping carbon

2060
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:43.640
dioxide into the atmosphere, we'd be falling back down

2061
01:43:43.649 --> 01:43:46.000
into another ice age. And that you can see

2062
01:43:46.009 --> 01:43:48.850
that in the data, the peak period for global

2063
01:43:48.859 --> 01:43:51.220
temperatures was about 4000 years ago. It's been getting

2064
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:54.339
cooler ever since 4000 years ago through the natural

2065
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:57.890
cycle. About 250 years ago, we started pumping carbon

2066
01:43:57.899 --> 01:44:01.430
dioxide out and that has meant a, a rise

2067
01:44:01.439 --> 01:44:04.189
in temperature which is an increase in temperature 30

2068
01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.419
times faster than the fall in temperature caused by

2069
01:44:07.439 --> 01:44:09.180
the, the maximum rate of decline in the Wako

2070
01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:13.830
cycle going back down into another ice age that

2071
01:44:14.339 --> 01:44:17.750
uh the infrastructure we built everything we were built

2072
01:44:17.759 --> 01:44:22.529
to uh enable us to have industrial uh production

2073
01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:26.410
and industrial agriculture and so on. Um Relied upon

2074
01:44:26.419 --> 01:44:29.109
a temperature range of about plus or minus one

2075
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:33.229
degree around that holocene average. We are now 1.5

2076
01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.709
degrees above that average and increasing a factor of

2077
01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.790
30 our infrastructure will not cope and we're now

2078
01:44:38.799 --> 01:44:41.680
starting to see the beginning signs of that with

2079
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:44.720
some of the catastrophic storms, we're seeing anybody wants

2080
01:44:44.729 --> 01:44:47.439
to argue that, you know, Swiss Alps have always

2081
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:50.419
been washed away during a storm. You know, Swiss

2082
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:53.500
villages have always disappeared. But that's garbage that the

2083
01:44:53.509 --> 01:44:55.930
events we're seeing now, I mean, when I was

2084
01:44:55.939 --> 01:44:59.240
with a colleague from Milan recently in the Caribbean

2085
01:44:59.410 --> 01:45:02.479
and he, he told me about seeing as, as

2086
01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:04.919
I've seen on Twitter, rivers of ice flowing through

2087
01:45:04.930 --> 01:45:07.899
Milan in summer and those rivers of ice occurs

2088
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:11.799
by catastrophic hailstorms which create so much hail that

2089
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:13.979
literally you get a river of ice flowing through

2090
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:16.810
the streets of Milan during late spring, you know,

2091
01:45:16.819 --> 01:45:20.729
bizarre stuff like that. Um So what we're getting

2092
01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:22.640
is the volatility that comes out of increasing the

2093
01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:25.560
temperature by 1.5 degrees, which is what we've done

2094
01:45:25.569 --> 01:45:28.620
over the pre industrial level and that increases the

2095
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:32.140
moisture content by the atmosphere by 10%. It also

2096
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:35.649
increases the volatility of the atmosphere. So we're gonna

2097
01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:38.919
see storms which destroy the infrastructure we built for

2098
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:41.750
that stable one plus or minus one degree level.

2099
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:44.680
And that's why it's important. Uh We only have

2100
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:49.069
GDP if we have factories. Now, mainstream economists who

2101
01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.509
are a bunch of losers when it comes to

2102
01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.080
how they think about the real world. So let's

2103
01:45:54.089 --> 01:45:59.020
assume that storms don't affect factories. Let's assume that

2104
01:45:59.029 --> 01:46:02.089
damage from, you know, high temperatures or high rainfall

2105
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:05.160
only damages goods and services. It doesn't damage factories.

2106
01:46:05.169 --> 01:46:08.180
That's a nice assumption. That'll simplify our model. It

2107
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:11.370
makes your model completely bullshit, completely wrong, but that's

2108
01:46:11.379 --> 01:46:14.490
what they've done. So they make assumptions. They basically

2109
01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:16.879
assume climate change doesn't affect the economy and then

2110
01:46:16.890 --> 01:46:18.740
talk about how to manage the economy because of

2111
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:22.839
climate change. It's just ludicrous. So I'm, I'm incredibly

2112
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:25.009
angry about what they've done because they're going to

2113
01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:27.549
destroy capitalism. But the only way we maintain a

2114
01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.669
capitalist economy is to maintain that temperature level we

2115
01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:34.069
hit during the Holocene period. We should have used

2116
01:46:34.089 --> 01:46:36.279
what we now know about how the climate is

2117
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:39.830
affected by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses to

2118
01:46:39.839 --> 01:46:43.770
stabilize the temperature at that six degrees above the

2119
01:46:43.779 --> 01:46:47.049
previous ice age level. Even through the cycles, we

2120
01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:48.950
know the planet's gonna go through that would have

2121
01:46:48.959 --> 01:46:54.319
been rational. Instead, we've blasted into unknown territory 30

2122
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:57.000
times faster than the natural cycles loan would take

2123
01:46:57.009 --> 01:47:00.120
us. And that is gonna destroy our infrastructure just

2124
01:47:00.129 --> 01:47:03.049
as effectively if we'd let the natural cycle continue

2125
01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.899
and we'd end up with the, with the sheets

2126
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:08.129
of ice over, over New York, which is the

2127
01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:11.419
other extreme. So we should have gone for stability

2128
01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:15.189
instead because of neoclassical economists who like to think

2129
01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.200
capitalism cope with anything. Therefore, global war can't be

2130
01:47:18.209 --> 01:47:20.970
a problem. We're about to see what I expect

2131
01:47:20.979 --> 01:47:22.560
to be the destruction of capitalism

2132
01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:26.279
and what do you make of some of those

2133
01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:30.879
arguments that sometimes we hear particularly from econom uh

2134
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:34.359
economists and also people associated of course with the

2135
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:38.640
financial system when they say or claim that, oh,

2136
01:47:38.649 --> 01:47:42.859
you know, of course, we're having more natural disasters

2137
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:45.890
here and there across the globe. But people are

2138
01:47:45.899 --> 01:47:49.439
not considering the fact that because the temperatures have

2139
01:47:49.450 --> 01:47:52.160
been rising over the past few years that there

2140
01:47:52.169 --> 01:47:57.060
are a few places in the world where actually

2141
01:47:57.069 --> 01:48:01.180
life now is a bit better for some people.

2142
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:04.979
They have more livable conditions. And also when they

2143
01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:07.450
say that, oh, and at the end of the

2144
01:48:07.459 --> 01:48:13.330
day, we will eventually tackle this issue through technological

2145
01:48:13.339 --> 01:48:16.560
development or I I mean, those kinds of arguments

2146
01:48:16.569 --> 01:48:17.390
that we sometimes

2147
01:48:17.399 --> 01:48:22.509
naive, simply naive. Uh IF for example, pe people

2148
01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.109
think, OK, now that we've got, you know, higher

2149
01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.709
temperatures we can now farm Siberia, well put the

2150
01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.810
top soil then first please. OK, what, what exists

2151
01:48:29.819 --> 01:48:33.140
in Siberia used to be permafrost? Uh THE idea

2152
01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:36.250
that you can farm permafrost just shows people have

2153
01:48:36.279 --> 01:48:39.359
never seen what the soil is like and don't

2154
01:48:39.370 --> 01:48:41.240
know what it's like to have methane seeping out

2155
01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:43.220
of the soil as the, as the, as the

2156
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:48.169
permafrost melts and, and microorganisms start turning the carbon

2157
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.819
stored there into either methane or carbon dioxide. Uh

2158
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:55.879
It's simply, they just simply don't realize the scale

2159
01:48:55.890 --> 01:48:59.560
on which the planet itself operates and the forces

2160
01:48:59.569 --> 01:49:03.549
were triggering by uh by letting the temperature rise

2161
01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.589
will then cause tipping points with other systems where

2162
01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.100
they will take over the damage they're doing to

2163
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:11.810
our system right now. So one of the classic

2164
01:49:11.819 --> 01:49:15.990
tipping points is losing uh ice because ice reflects

2165
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.390
sunlight. And the, the reason we have global warming

2166
01:49:18.399 --> 01:49:20.439
is not because we're pumping lots of heat into

2167
01:49:20.450 --> 01:49:22.810
the atmosphere. That will be the case if we

2168
01:49:22.819 --> 01:49:25.479
could keep on going for 400 years. But at

2169
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:28.459
the moment, it's only a trivial contribution to the

2170
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:31.830
increase in temperature. Most of the increases by extra

2171
01:49:31.839 --> 01:49:35.819
carbon uh carbon dioxide and other uh greenhouse gasses

2172
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:38.700
including the extra moisture cos that's also a CA

2173
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:42.810
A AAA greenhouse gas that increases the amount of

2174
01:49:42.819 --> 01:49:45.919
temperature you retain. So the sun come, that's then

2175
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:47.810
it comes in from the sun and it gets

2176
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.500
uh prevented from going back out again as infrared

2177
01:49:50.509 --> 01:49:54.229
by bouncing off these molecules that capture the infrared.

2178
01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.410
And therefore it raises the overall temperature of the,

2179
01:49:56.700 --> 01:50:00.819
the biosphere. Uh THE, the forces are enormous. So

2180
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:03.359
if we lose the amount of ice, which is

2181
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.109
happening quite radically. Right now, there's less reflection that

2182
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.720
also increases temperature, that's independent of the carbon dioxide

2183
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:13.870
cycle. Uh If we then uh loosen up the

2184
01:50:13.879 --> 01:50:17.979
permafrost and even worse ocean methane hydrates, the amount

2185
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:20.459
of carbon there is in, in the, in the,

2186
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:23.939
in the uh permafrost is apparently two or three

2187
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:26.270
times what we've already put into the atmosphere. If

2188
01:50:26.279 --> 01:50:29.750
that starts letting itself go in a, you know,

2189
01:50:29.759 --> 01:50:32.779
it's like a chain reaction, that chain reaction is

2190
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:34.950
far more powerful than we can do to control

2191
01:50:34.959 --> 01:50:38.620
it. So we're letting forces, we're, we're, we're, we're

2192
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:41.979
letting loose forces that we have no conception of

2193
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:44.640
the scale and no capacity to control. And that's

2194
01:50:44.649 --> 01:50:47.830
why it's simply irresponsible and dangerous and this sort

2195
01:50:47.839 --> 01:50:49.830
of stuff, anybody who talks in that way should

2196
01:50:49.839 --> 01:50:51.759
be thrown out of any discussion over what to

2197
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:56.080
do. But unfortunately, because economists are taken seriously, people

2198
01:50:56.089 --> 01:50:58.470
believe they know what they're talking about and they

2199
01:50:58.479 --> 01:51:00.870
think that economists are taking what scientists have said

2200
01:51:00.879 --> 01:51:03.270
and put it into economic terms. Nothing could be

2201
01:51:03.279 --> 01:51:07.490
further from the truth. I have read every paper

2202
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.899
that economists have written on the total cost of

2203
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:13.060
carbon, of climate change and hundreds of other papers

2204
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:17.250
by economists and I've read two or three times

2205
01:51:17.259 --> 01:51:21.069
as many papers by scientists and not one of

2206
01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:25.069
the papers by economists makes assumptions that any scientist

2207
01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:28.779
would accept about what climate change does to the

2208
01:51:28.899 --> 01:51:34.140
global system So economists have bullshitted their way because

2209
01:51:34.339 --> 01:51:37.580
they really didn't want to understand this issue. They

2210
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:39.490
simply wanted a way to say it doesn't matter.

2211
01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:41.600
And they've made up their own numbers to say

2212
01:51:41.609 --> 01:51:43.830
that it doesn't matter. The numbers have got nothing

2213
01:51:43.839 --> 01:51:45.750
to do with the physical real world and we're

2214
01:51:45.759 --> 01:51:49.629
likely seeing the collapse of their predictions happening this

2215
01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:53.200
year and going forward, uh the damage that global

2216
01:51:53.209 --> 01:51:56.359
warming will do to our productive a apparatus is

2217
01:51:56.370 --> 01:51:59.229
far, far greater than economists have misled us into

2218
01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.109
believing. So the financial system which has taken their

2219
01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.100
advice seriously is likely to have a serious collapse

2220
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:08.750
at a Minsky moment, once people realize just how

2221
01:52:08.759 --> 01:52:12.029
wrong these predictions are, uh and we're gonna destroy

2222
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:14.509
our productive capability at the same time, it'll be

2223
01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:15.910
a struggle to hang on to what we call

2224
01:52:15.919 --> 01:52:19.009
civilization and that's what we should be thinking about.

2225
01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:23.160
We are destroying our capacity to have the civilization

2226
01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.299
we call capitalism.

2227
01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:27.950
Mhm. So, uh also I would like to have

2228
01:52:27.959 --> 01:52:32.000
your reaction to another kind of ar argument that

2229
01:52:32.009 --> 01:52:36.419
we hear very frequently from economists and other people

2230
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:40.120
like that. This is probably even more common than

2231
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:44.310
the other kinds of arguments I mentioned before. I

2232
01:52:44.319 --> 01:52:49.299
mean, when they say that um to tackle climate

2233
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:54.500
change, it would imply slowing down economic growth in

2234
01:52:54.509 --> 01:52:59.560
a way that would have even worse consequences than

2235
01:52:59.569 --> 01:53:02.850
the consequences of climate change itself. And so, and

2236
01:53:02.859 --> 01:53:05.950
so it would be better to just, I mean,

2237
01:53:05.959 --> 01:53:09.790
basically for the most part, keep uh keep things

2238
01:53:09.799 --> 01:53:14.819
running and having uh higher levels of economic growth,

2239
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:20.000
even if we contribute to raising temp global temperatures

2240
01:53:20.009 --> 01:53:22.669
even more. I mean, does that make any sense

2241
01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.229
at all?

2242
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:26.160
None whatsoever. Can I use French and they're fucking

2243
01:53:26.169 --> 01:53:29.720
idiots? Ok. This is stupid stuff. They should never

2244
01:53:29.729 --> 01:53:32.140
have been allowed under the policy discussion. Uh And

2245
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:34.229
I say they're fucking idiots because when you look

2246
01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:36.580
at how they've tried to calibrate this stuff, they'll

2247
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:39.910
make assumptions like as Nordhaus did initially that a

2248
01:53:39.919 --> 01:53:42.259
roof will protect you from climate change. He didn't

2249
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:45.509
put it quite that stupidly. He wrote um economic

2250
01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:49.200
activity. Most economic activity takes heaven carefully controlled environments

2251
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:52.410
which will be negligently affected by climate change. Now,

2252
01:53:52.419 --> 01:53:56.160
his definition of carefully controlled environments uh and when

2253
01:53:56.169 --> 01:53:58.270
you first put that phrase out in a 1991

2254
01:53:58.279 --> 01:54:01.839
paper was all of manufacturing, all of wholesale and

2255
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:05.149
retail services, all of the government sector, all as

2256
01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:08.089
finance and insurance and most of real estate and

2257
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.979
some transportation as well. And he said that 87%

2258
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:15.060
of the economy would be negligibly affected by climate

2259
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:18.990
change. And he included mining, he literally had mining

2260
01:54:19.089 --> 01:54:21.069
as an industry which would be neckless, be affected

2261
01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:24.229
by climate change and a total of 87%. Now,

2262
01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.250
sometime later, somebody must have tapped him on the

2263
01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:28.689
shoulder and said, oh William, there were there was

2264
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.629
open cut mining mate as well as underground mining.

2265
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:34.910
So in a 1993 paper, he then revised it

2266
01:54:34.919 --> 01:54:38.029
and said underground mining would be unaffected and he

2267
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:41.129
reduced the figure from 87 to 85%. Now that

2268
01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.959
shows he basically thinks to be exposed to climate

2269
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:45.970
change. You have to be exposed to the weather,

2270
01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:47.970
which is why I say he's assuming a roof

2271
01:54:47.979 --> 01:54:50.149
will protect you from climate change. Tell that to

2272
01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:52.149
anybody in the Swiss villages that just got wiped

2273
01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:54.370
out a couple of days ago by avalanches caused

2274
01:54:54.379 --> 01:54:57.669
by excess rainfall. Tell that to anybody in Houston

2275
01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.819
who's, who's uh super uh uh skyscrapers had their

2276
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:04.839
windows smashed by tornadoes that went through about four

2277
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:08.580
or five weeks ago. Uh And, and, and until

2278
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:10.259
it's the people in, in Taiwan, I had to

2279
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:14.000
shut down semiconductor plants because the, the water got

2280
01:55:14.009 --> 01:55:16.129
too hot to be able to be used for

2281
01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:18.720
some of the cooling processes. So the whole idea

2282
01:55:18.729 --> 01:55:21.850
that a roof will protect you from climate change

2283
01:55:21.859 --> 01:55:24.029
shows how caught up they are on a blackboard

2284
01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.500
view of the world or a white board view

2285
01:55:25.509 --> 01:55:27.709
of the world where you put in your GDP

2286
01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.129
as a function of labor and capital and everything

2287
01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.899
happens inside the brackets of the function. But like

2288
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:34.399
in the real world, even if it were true

2289
01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:36.750
that a roof is protected from climate change, you've

2290
01:55:36.759 --> 01:55:38.250
still gotta put goods on the services on a

2291
01:55:38.259 --> 01:55:39.870
road to go to another factory to get them

2292
01:55:39.879 --> 01:55:42.279
worked over if the road gets washed away by

2293
01:55:42.339 --> 01:55:44.859
a storm, which happened in Vancouver a couple of

2294
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:47.790
years ago, you can't use the road anymore. Ok.

2295
01:55:47.799 --> 01:55:50.060
So there's no, there's no such thing as a

2296
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:53.439
carefully controlled environment. There's a, there's an environment set

2297
01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:57.560
up for the existing environmental conditions inside a closed

2298
01:55:57.569 --> 01:56:01.040
facility, but they change those environmental facilities and the

2299
01:56:01.049 --> 01:56:03.720
air conditioning parameters of the factory won't work anymore.

2300
01:56:03.729 --> 01:56:06.569
The roads won't work, the machines will be destroyed

2301
01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:09.729
and flooded out, etcetera, etcetera. The naivety of these

2302
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.540
assumptions is simply breathtaking. And when I look at

2303
01:56:12.549 --> 01:56:16.189
it, the only reason this shit got published is

2304
01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:19.189
because other academic, other economists ref refereed it and

2305
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.979
they're equally stupid and clueless about what climate change

2306
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:25.160
is and what climate change means. So we have

2307
01:56:25.169 --> 01:56:27.250
uh when people finally look at this as I

2308
01:56:27.259 --> 01:56:29.729
only did, unfortunately, just uh five years ago and

2309
01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:32.830
I finally read this nonsense, I realized none of

2310
01:56:32.839 --> 01:56:36.370
this stuff should have been published only because economics

2311
01:56:36.379 --> 01:56:40.000
itself is such a crippled discipline was garbage like

2312
01:56:40.009 --> 01:56:42.490
this ever allowed into print. And the trouble is

2313
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:46.890
that people outside academia think refereeing means only quality

2314
01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:50.990
work gets published that applies in some sciences, in

2315
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.149
genuine sciences. But in economics refereeing means this was

2316
01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.810
approved by other people who believe the market system

2317
01:56:56.819 --> 01:56:59.629
is the best of all possible systems and also

2318
01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.910
reject any challenge that says we're soliciting loose forces

2319
01:57:02.919 --> 01:57:06.419
which might wipe out our system. So it's garbage

2320
01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:10.060
should never have been published. And uh when people,

2321
01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.129
you know, I've, I've spent five years trying to

2322
01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.540
communicate this to the public just how bad the

2323
01:57:14.549 --> 01:57:17.299
work of economists is. Um I've got through to

2324
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:20.589
some people, but policy makers are still accepting that

2325
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:23.549
economists know what they're talking about, still letting them

2326
01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.450
make most of the decisions. And the result is

2327
01:57:26.459 --> 01:57:29.890
we are walking into a catastrophe, blindfolded by economic

2328
01:57:29.899 --> 01:57:30.270
theory.

2329
01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:33.970
So let me ask you just two more questions

2330
01:57:33.979 --> 01:57:36.959
then uh and on that last bit about the

2331
01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:41.919
catastrophe we w we're walking into, I mean, according

2332
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:47.350
to perhaps the best estimates, predictions that we have.

2333
01:57:47.359 --> 01:57:51.680
And I'm not only asking you environmentally but mostly

2334
01:57:51.689 --> 01:57:56.700
economically speaking because this is an economics interview. What

2335
01:57:56.819 --> 01:58:03.299
are the worst possible consequences of climate change that

2336
01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:05.259
we might experience in the future?

2337
01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:13.390
Nest fes uh global starvation, what are called wet

2338
01:58:13.399 --> 01:58:15.709
belt temperatures, levels of heat and, and, and, and

2339
01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:19.279
humidity as well, which mean people, even he healthy

2340
01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:22.990
people uh in the shade die within six hours

2341
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:28.720
more pandemics. We're likely to get a bird flu

2342
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:32.089
pandemic coming away pretty shortly that might kill, you

2343
01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:34.319
know, half the population of the planet if it

2344
01:58:34.330 --> 01:58:39.359
gets widely distributed. Um COLLAPSE of civilisations, people normally

2345
01:58:39.370 --> 01:58:41.720
think it's gonna be poor countries that collapse. Economists

2346
01:58:41.729 --> 01:58:44.000
feed this garbage all the time out about that.

2347
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:45.629
I think it might be the, it's more likely

2348
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.870
to be the highly advanced industrial civilisations where people

2349
01:58:48.879 --> 01:58:52.180
are enormously separated from food production, they're more likely

2350
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:53.490
to suffer. So I wouldn't want to be in

2351
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.399
England when climate change really strikes because they already

2352
01:58:56.410 --> 01:59:00.049
import pretty close to half their food. And therefore,

2353
01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:02.020
if there's a global famine, the British won't be

2354
01:59:02.029 --> 01:59:07.879
able to weep um social breakdown, possibly even wars,

2355
01:59:07.890 --> 01:59:12.990
wars between different countries, potentially nuclear war. It's Armageddon.

2356
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.549
We're playing with Armageddon and trying to maximize our

2357
01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.390
utility through Armageddon. And, and that is incredibly dangerous.

2358
01:59:19.399 --> 01:59:23.319
So, uh and this will, this won't happen gradually.

2359
01:59:23.439 --> 01:59:26.629
It will happen in fits and starts and then

2360
01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:29.660
catastrophic changes at different times. So nobody can say

2361
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:33.680
what the actual uh you know, first devastating blow

2362
01:59:33.689 --> 01:59:36.810
will be my. If you, if you, if you

2363
01:59:36.819 --> 01:59:39.270
look at the climate change community, they're sort of

2364
01:59:39.279 --> 01:59:41.399
taking bets these days. Not quite, but there's a,

2365
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:43.470
there's one guy on Twitter who has fake bets

2366
01:59:43.479 --> 01:59:46.029
regularly and you know, what's it gonna be? Global

2367
01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:52.330
famine, global pandemic uh hit wet bulb catastrophes. Uh

2368
01:59:52.410 --> 01:59:57.069
You know, super storms, what's gonna be the thing

2369
01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:00.819
that wakes people up? And uh iiii I pretty

2370
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:02.299
much put my chips down on the, on the

2371
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:05.089
global famine front because if we had like one

2372
02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:08.669
day of extreme temperatures over Iowa with low levels

2373
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.200
of humidity that can actually burn the crop in

2374
02:00:11.209 --> 02:00:14.279
situ. So suddenly you've got enough feed for, you

2375
02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:16.930
know, food to feed a billion people. And then

2376
02:00:16.939 --> 02:00:18.919
one day later you've got enough to feed a

2377
02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:22.240
million people, uh, or you can have hail storms

2378
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:24.790
that wipe out it or you can have, um,

2379
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.890
uh, you know, hurricanes and tornadoes passing through and

2380
02:00:28.899 --> 02:00:31.279
destroying the crop all this. You know, we have

2381
02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:33.830
no idea what, how nature is gonna smash us

2382
02:00:33.839 --> 02:00:35.729
in the face. We just know that it's gonna

2383
02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:38.220
smash us in the face and to say we

2384
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:39.700
can all put it off and do it later

2385
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:41.910
shows they have no concept of the level of

2386
02:00:41.919 --> 02:00:44.629
forces that are involved in this. And they're trivializing

2387
02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.470
the issue we face and they should not be

2388
02:00:46.479 --> 02:00:47.939
allowed anywhere near policy.

2389
02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:55.290
So it's a very strong possibility that civilization as

2390
02:00:55.299 --> 02:00:59.359
we know it nowadays might completely collapse,

2391
02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.689
will completely collapse. I mean, I I you, you,

2392
02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.450
you'll get a range of opinion, Michael Mann is

2393
02:01:04.459 --> 02:01:06.689
still pushing the argument that we can all do

2394
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.759
it by 2050 which is true sort of if

2395
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:11.470
we have, if we actually treat the issue as

2396
02:01:11.479 --> 02:01:14.009
seriously as it deserves to be treated. But because

2397
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:17.709
economists have created these completely misleading ideas about the

2398
02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.600
damage we face, people have been doing trivial actions

2399
02:01:20.609 --> 02:01:23.189
about it and the the rate of carbon increase

2400
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.270
of carbon dioxide pretty much reached the perfect exponential

2401
02:01:26.279 --> 02:01:29.660
curve from 1750 forward. All the policy we've done

2402
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:31.569
is on bugger all to change how fast rating

2403
02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:35.439
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, something like about 15%

2404
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:37.990
of the population even including some intelligent people like

2405
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.509
Richard Verner, I mentioned earlier uh believe myths about

2406
02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:44.720
climate change, believe that carbon dioxide doesn't cause anything.

2407
02:01:45.009 --> 02:01:47.279
Um And, and that it's actually good for us,

2408
02:01:47.290 --> 02:01:49.470
you know, carbon dioxide as plant food, yada, yada,

2409
02:01:49.479 --> 02:01:51.609
yada, all this sort of stuff is just means

2410
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:54.540
people who should be allowed nowhere near AAA chemistry

2411
02:01:54.549 --> 02:01:57.000
lab or a physics lab are making decisions about

2412
02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:59.470
chemists and chemistry and physics about which they know

2413
02:01:59.479 --> 02:02:03.069
nothing. And this is the real uh dilemma. The

2414
02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:05.029
people who know what they're talking about aren't being

2415
02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.740
listened to. And that's why seeing climate sciences like

2416
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:11.120
Peter Calamus locking himself to the door of shell

2417
02:02:11.129 --> 02:02:13.810
and, and, and gluing themselves to glass windows to

2418
02:02:13.819 --> 02:02:16.040
make a point about it where this was scientific

2419
02:02:16.049 --> 02:02:18.859
rebellion, the joint Extinction rebellion and so on. They're

2420
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:21.839
aware of the forces we're unleashing and they're terrified.

2421
02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:26.169
Now, the thing is if the experts are terrified

2422
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:29.609
and the amateurs are complacent, then it's vitally important.

2423
02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:31.189
You have the experts at the wheel of the

2424
02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.009
ship, not the amateurs. Who do we have the

2425
02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:34.759
amateurs?

2426
02:02:35.839 --> 02:02:40.270
Mhm. So let me ask you just one last

2427
02:02:40.279 --> 02:02:43.680
question to perhaps try, went on a more positive

2428
02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:45.919
note. I mean, I, I'm not sure to what

2429
02:02:45.930 --> 02:02:49.810
extent you are able to be optimistic in this

2430
02:02:49.819 --> 02:02:53.140
sort of circumstances and looking at how we keep

2431
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:57.990
doing things, but from an economics perspective, what would

2432
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.750
you say would possibly be some of the best

2433
02:03:01.759 --> 02:03:04.879
solutions to help tackle climate change.

2434
02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:07.879
We have to treat it like World War Two

2435
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:12.649
at the very minimum. Our entire economy is redirected

2436
02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:16.970
to attenuate and re the damages we've already done

2437
02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:20.799
and, and ameliorate the future consequences. That's not gonna

2438
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:23.950
happen until such time as we start seeing serious

2439
02:03:23.959 --> 02:03:26.750
breakdowns. And once the serious breakdowns happen, we're gonna

2440
02:03:26.759 --> 02:03:28.819
be losing facilities, we need to actually do the

2441
02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:31.729
process. So I, I'm sorry, I can't be optimistic.

2442
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:35.790
Uh I, I think uh the, the only optimism

2443
02:03:35.799 --> 02:03:37.879
I'd have is if, if, if, when the catastrophes

2444
02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:40.540
start rather than turning the economist, I, what do

2445
02:03:40.549 --> 02:03:42.609
we do now? Which is the mistake Obama made

2446
02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:46.479
back in 2009, we throw the economist at, ask

2447
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:48.200
the scientist in and say, what the hell do

2448
02:03:48.209 --> 02:03:50.470
we do? And we then convince the public this

2449
02:03:50.479 --> 02:03:54.520
is actually existential, we're facing existential threats. It has

2450
02:03:54.529 --> 02:03:57.169
to be treated the same way that only happened

2451
02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.229
with the second World War after the, you know,

2452
02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:01.970
the defeat of Poland and uh the, the collapse

2453
02:04:01.979 --> 02:04:05.040
of France and the uh and the evacuations from

2454
02:04:05.049 --> 02:04:08.970
Dunkirk. In that situation, the British finally took the

2455
02:04:08.979 --> 02:04:11.819
threat of Nazis seriously and we had Winston Churchill

2456
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:14.259
taking over and the four war effort began at

2457
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:17.339
that point. Um That is an easier problem, a

2458
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:20.240
far easier problem we face today. So we need

2459
02:04:20.250 --> 02:04:23.100
that sort of shift and I really don't see

2460
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:25.100
any sign of it. We'd look at the debate

2461
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:28.529
between uh Biden and Trump, which was, is a

2462
02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:30.899
farce in the first place. What's happening in the

2463
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:34.259
British elections, what happened in the French elections? Uh

2464
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:37.410
We simply are not even engaging with the scale

2465
02:04:37.419 --> 02:04:40.750
of danger we face. So the only optimism I

2466
02:04:40.759 --> 02:04:43.419
have and this is actually sounds rather ironical. We

2467
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:46.160
need to have the cat the, the, the wake

2468
02:04:46.169 --> 02:04:49.259
the fuck up catastrophe happening sooner rather than later.

2469
02:04:49.649 --> 02:04:51.600
Because if it happens later, the momentum will be

2470
02:04:51.609 --> 02:04:55.839
that much greater. So we need something which I

2471
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:58.279
have to put it this way. The only way

2472
02:04:58.649 --> 02:05:00.680
that we're gonna the West, which is the dominant

2473
02:05:00.689 --> 02:05:03.319
power on the planet will take this seriously is

2474
02:05:03.330 --> 02:05:06.540
lots of white people die in a climate catastrophe.

2475
02:05:07.439 --> 02:05:10.189
So we need 20 or 30 million Texans to

2476
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:13.109
die because of a wet bult catastrophe where, where

2477
02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:16.140
the isolated grid, power grid, it has breaks down

2478
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:19.140
any air conditioning fails and only those with Teslas

2479
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:23.569
survive. Um Then Yep. OK. Then America might wake

2480
02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:25.209
up. It won't have Texas anymore, but it would

2481
02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:28.290
have real, real realism about the dangers we face

2482
02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:30.060
something that's necessary.

2483
02:05:32.890 --> 02:05:36.379
Well, so just before we go, doctor Kim, uh

2484
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:39.319
the book is again Rebuilding Economics from the top

2485
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:42.149
down. Would you like to tell people where they

2486
02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.910
can find your book and the rest of your

2487
02:05:44.919 --> 02:05:46.279
work on the internet?

2488
02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:49.290
Um That book is still in, in process of

2489
02:05:49.299 --> 02:05:52.430
being published by a Hungarian company. So I got

2490
02:05:52.439 --> 02:05:55.430
the OK to publish extracts from it on my

2491
02:05:55.479 --> 02:05:57.930
Patreon and substack pages. So if you go to

2492
02:05:58.470 --> 02:06:02.279
uh Triple W patreon.com/prof Steve Keen or Prof Steve

2493
02:06:02.339 --> 02:06:06.810
keen.substack.com, they'll find extracts from the, from the book

2494
02:06:06.819 --> 02:06:09.419
uh in those sites. Uh I've also just signed

2495
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:12.549
a contract with polity uh books, which I'll hopefully

2496
02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:15.290
finish by March of next year and hopefully come

2497
02:06:15.299 --> 02:06:17.319
out in July. And the title of that, the

2498
02:06:17.330 --> 02:06:19.689
working title of that book is How Economics Will

2499
02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:23.109
Destroy capitalism. And that will give the same sort

2500
02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.439
of arguments I given from economics to the top

2501
02:06:25.450 --> 02:06:28.810
down, but basically reverse the direction. So in economics

2502
02:06:28.819 --> 02:06:30.220
from the top down, I go through all the

2503
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:32.569
flaws in economic theory and then finish off with

2504
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:36.200
the, the, the garbage they've written on climate change

2505
02:06:36.359 --> 02:06:37.959
with this other book. I'm gonna start with the

2506
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:40.330
garbage on climate change. And then for people who

2507
02:06:40.339 --> 02:06:42.370
have never read Economics before, the question will be

2508
02:06:42.379 --> 02:06:44.620
how On Earth is this stuff ever published there?

2509
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:46.589
Then after that point, I'll go through and explain

2510
02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:48.930
how delusional economics is in general and how it

2511
02:06:48.939 --> 02:06:53.529
led to these critical delusions over climate change. So,

2512
02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:55.629
Patreon and subtract, that's the main answer.

2513
02:06:56.049 --> 02:06:58.430
Yeah, I'm leaving links to that in the description

2514
02:06:58.439 --> 02:07:00.990
of the interview and doctor Ken. Thank you so

2515
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.640
