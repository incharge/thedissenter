00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.259
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:06.210
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:09.399
joined by Doctor Lydia Moland. She's a professor of

4
00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.430
Philosophy at Colby College in Waterville Maine in the

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:17.270
US. She has written extensively on 19th century German

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.979
philosophy. And more recently, she has also been interested

7
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.049
in abolitionism in the US. And she wrote a

8
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.909
book titled Lydia Maria Child, a Radical American Life

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.310
based on the American evolutionist with the same name.

10
00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:35.889
So, Doctor Moland, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.389
big pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.680
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be invited and

13
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.189
I'm looking forward to our conversation.

14
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.720
OK. So, uh I would like to start by

15
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.500
talking about your work on 19th century German philosophy.

16
00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.750
So, first of all, why did you get interested

17
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:59.810
specifically in 19th century German philosophy? And do you

18
00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:05.449
think that if anything, there's uh specific aspects of

19
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.519
it that make it distinct from other kinds of

20
00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:13.569
philosophy, from other places and other time periods?

21
00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.599
Yes. Thank you for that. Um I got interested

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.300
in German 19th century philosophy through Spinoza. So I

23
00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:24.550
took a very general philosophy course as an undergraduate.

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.669
Uh AND I had intended to be a political

25
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.830
science major, but I read Spinoza and it just

26
00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:34.669
blew my mind and I, I was so moved

27
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.699
by the vision that Spinoza had of holism and

28
00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.550
of um and, and the way he argued that

29
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.220
I decided to do more philosophy and ended up

30
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.010
in a course that ended with Kant. And I

31
00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:51.330
think as many people do finished with some very

32
00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:56.129
deep dissatisfactions with Kant's dualism and with his rationalism.

33
00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.610
And someone said to me, well, if you are

34
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.809
impatient with Kant, maybe you should try Hegel. Uh

35
00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.069
So the next semester, I took a course on

36
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.129
the Phenomenology of Spirit and then I was just

37
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.768
hooked. Um AND I ended up going to Tubingen

38
00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.738
in Germany where Hegel himself studied, I lived there

39
00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:16.908
for a couple of years and really immersed myself

40
00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:22.798
in the culture of that particular time period. So

41
00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.348
many of your viewers will know that Tubing in

42
00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:28.718
is also where Holderlin lived and studied and also

43
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:33.770
shelling. So Hagel was there in this incredibly fertile

44
00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:39.740
environment where people were taking very seriously. Spinoza was

45
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.429
still essentially forbidden. He was still considered too controversial

46
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.940
and too heretical to take seriously. But they were

47
00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.679
all sort of closet spin assists. And um I,

48
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.199
I found all of that very intriguing. I think

49
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.160
what, what really pulled me into Hagel was his

50
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.830
attempt to make philosophical sense of religion and of

51
00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.949
protestantism. In particularly I came from a protestant background

52
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.839
and was really intrigued by his attempt to show

53
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.440
what was important and vital about the protestant worldview

54
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.699
without attaching it to a kind of uh religious

55
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.500
literalism. Um So that was, that was very helpful

56
00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.089
to me, even just in thinking through my own

57
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.350
philosophical questions. So as far as what makes that

58
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.869
period distinct, um a couple of things come to

59
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.809
mind, again, sort of connected to Spinoza. I think

60
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.839
the, again, this idea of holism, the attempt not

61
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.660
to think of philosophy as just addressing one problem

62
00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.720
or focusing on just epistemology or just in the

63
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.910
physics. But the idea that an idea could possibly

64
00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:59.179
explain kind of everything. Um I think characterizes a

65
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.320
lot of early 19th century philosophy in Germany, certainly

66
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.600
not later. But sometimes when I teach students this,

67
00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.800
I find that, that, that claim is really strange

68
00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.770
to them that there could be one answer or

69
00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.320
one idea that could explain everything. But I sometimes

70
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.329
push back on that and say, wouldn't it be

71
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:25.179
even stranger if different parts of the reality or

72
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.190
of philosophy were totally unconnected from each other? I

73
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.140
wouldn't it be sort of strange if nature functions

74
00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:35.869
in a completely different way from art or from

75
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.470
politics or from epistemology? So, isn't there something even

76
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.510
just more intellectually consistent about looking for an idea

77
00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:50.600
that could explain most of human experience and maybe

78
00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:55.910
even nonhuman experience? So that's one another, I think

79
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.220
a lot of really existential questions get started in

80
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.730
the 19th century. So you see that some in

81
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.760
Kant for sure. But I think it took this

82
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.890
generation of thinkers who grew up in the French

83
00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:14.809
revolution, which meant that everything they thought they knew

84
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.820
about the way politics could and should work were

85
00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:23.130
um was, was challenged. And then there were great

86
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.839
hopes around the French revolution and then they were

87
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.190
dashed. And so this was a generation that really

88
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.779
grew up feeling the existential weight of a major

89
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.980
historical disappointment if you were a young person in

90
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:39.980
that generation. Um And, and so the combination I

91
00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:44.720
think of K turn towards the subject, which really

92
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.450
gives an individual subject an enormous amount of power.

93
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.029
And therefore, also responsibility opens up these big existential

94
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.750
questions and then living in this part of history

95
00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.489
where there are enormous shifts um that ask questions

96
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.119
like what is the role of politics and what

97
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.950
is the role of the individual in politics? And

98
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.869
how do individuals assert themselves in the face of

99
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.829
great historical forces? Um Those set the stage for

100
00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.459
the kinds of grappling with, what does it mean

101
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.059
to be an individual? What does it mean to

102
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.329
be alienated in a society? Um Obviously something that's

103
00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:26.200
been picked up by Marx and then more by

104
00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:29.869
Kirkegaard and Nietzsche later in the century. Um And

105
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.540
then I would also say, and, and this is

106
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:34.029
clearly in part because of my own work, a

107
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:41.140
real reorientation around art and around aesthetic experience. So

108
00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:43.799
that certainly gets started in Kant with his taking

109
00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.899
seriously aesthetic experience is one of the most important

110
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.399
things about human experience. Um But then when you

111
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.160
get to people like Hegel, but also very much

112
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.795
his contemporaries like Lael or Novalis, Bettina von Ar

113
00:06:57.114 --> 00:06:59.704
Carlina Von Gunder Rode. Um SOME of these other

114
00:06:59.714 --> 00:07:03.404
people who saw in art and then also in

115
00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:09.045
nature and our aesthetic responses to nature, really central

116
00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.075
truths about the human condition. Then I, I think

117
00:07:12.084 --> 00:07:14.334
you get something very interesting that lasts throughout the

118
00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:16.984
century in part because I think one way I

119
00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:20.410
try to think about it is the question, what

120
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.739
if art far from being derivative or entertaining or

121
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.630
the thing that we can philosophize about kind of

122
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.390
if we get to it? What if instead it

123
00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.820
is the thing, the thing that that can explain

124
00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:40.980
us to ourselves and the world to ourselves better

125
00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:45.260
than other branches of philosophy. If that's true, then

126
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:48.779
a lot of things need to be revolved um

127
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.920
sort in any kind of revolution so that I'll

128
00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.470
stop there. But those are a couple of the

129
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.829
things that I find really compelling and possibly um

130
00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.929
I don't know, unique but certainly indicative of that

131
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.730
period in that place in the world.

132
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.010
OK. So I have to tell you straight away

133
00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.679
that the three German philosophers whose work I'm most

134
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.640
familiar with are Kent Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. So uh

135
00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:17.380
probably because of some of my personality traits. I

136
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.070
don't know exactly why, but those are the three

137
00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:24.320
I felt most compelled about. And, uh, I mean,

138
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:28.917
but, uh, of course, I guess that we could

139
00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:33.177
pretty much say that, uh, everyone in the 19th

140
00:08:33.187 --> 00:08:37.756
century in German was to some extent influenced by

141
00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:41.986
Kent. Right? I mean, even the ones who rejected

142
00:08:42.067 --> 00:08:44.617
most of his philosophy or some, or parts of

143
00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:49.768
his philosophy, like for example, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, Nietzsche,

144
00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:53.445
to a greater extent, even them were very, very

145
00:08:53.455 --> 00:08:56.426
much influenced by Kent. I, I think we could

146
00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.935
and of course, uh I mean, it's not that

147
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:03.906
German philosophy in the 19th centuries is a monolith,

148
00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:08.916
like for example, sometimes people talk about German idealism,

149
00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:12.986
but I mean, you get into figures like Schopenhauer

150
00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:18.395
and Nietzsche and they were extremely different from can

151
00:09:18.473 --> 00:09:23.443
or what you would consider just general idealism. Nietzsche

152
00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:29.953
particularly sometimes is classified as a romantic or rationalist

153
00:09:29.963 --> 00:09:36.374
and he certainly rejected many aspects of Kent's philosophy.

154
00:09:36.383 --> 00:09:41.294
And Schopenhauer was very much a pessimist for example.

155
00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:44.031
So, uh but I mean, do you think that

156
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.512
we could look uh even with those differences? And

157
00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.351
of course, we could talk about the other philosophers

158
00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.932
and they certainly have m many distinct things about

159
00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:59.802
their philosophical corpus, I think. But uh do you

160
00:09:59.812 --> 00:10:04.361
think that e even with all of those differences

161
00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:08.471
and existentialism also that I didn't mention and all

162
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:12.650
of that, that we can still find recurrent themes

163
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:15.969
in 19th century German philosophy.

164
00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:20.289
Yeah, I mean, I, I think one really is

165
00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:24.049
the struggle with the nature of subjectivity and what

166
00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:31.809
it means. Epistemological, metaphysically, politically, aesthetically. Uh What does

167
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.359
it mean to be a self? And like if

168
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.039
you think not to oversimplify, but if you think

169
00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:40.400
about someone like Descartes just saying, well, the self

170
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:43.559
is a thinking thing. It's essentially an immaterial substance.

171
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:46.159
Um ITS essence is just to think and it

172
00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:50.849
subsists as a thinking thing. Um You know, a

173
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:55.840
quick contrast to Kant, I think is Kant's idea

174
00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:59.380
of this self as an activity. So as something

175
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.539
that is actively synthesizing whatever is coming at it

176
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.539
and that it only achieves selfhood through being active.

177
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:11.510
And I think in a way, one of the

178
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.039
questions that survives all the way through the century

179
00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:17.780
then is um what kind of activity is that?

180
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.159
And what does the basis of thinking through subjectivity?

181
00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:28.489
Um MEAN for objectivity and for reality and for

182
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.020
how we treat other people and obviously paired with

183
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.700
that is the question of whether there is a

184
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.460
transcendent divine that humans are beholden to or created

185
00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:44.500
by and who dictates reality as we see it.

186
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.409
And in my opinion, Hagel, for instance, is trying

187
00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:52.239
very hard to reorient us from that to seeing

188
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.409
that humans are the only creators of meaning and

189
00:11:56.419 --> 00:12:01.400
that we only create meaning in cooper operation with

190
00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:04.419
each other. So there's, if you think about kind

191
00:12:04.429 --> 00:12:07.729
as primarily thinking of the subject as activity. Hagel,

192
00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:09.659
I think picks that up but with a much

193
00:12:09.669 --> 00:12:14.020
stronger emphasis on the kind of mutual recognition that's

194
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.789
necessary to think about my being a subject is

195
00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:21.349
dependent on your recognizing me as a subject. And

196
00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:24.010
only when we recognize each other, not just abs

197
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.109
as abstract subjects, but as subjects embodied in different

198
00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:33.729
roles and different areas of history, different life plans.

199
00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:36.320
Can we really treat each other with the dignity

200
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.330
and respect that Kant had originally said we owed

201
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.580
each other. And so I think like if you

202
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.590
follow that trajectory out um and start to think

203
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.659
about like Kirke guards grappling with what it meant

204
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.390
to be a subject kind of at odds with

205
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.320
um with the conventional world or norms that were

206
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.700
established by a society that he didn't feel um

207
00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:05.880
acknowledged by. And then someone like Nietzsche, who I

208
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:12.390
think is even more expressly celebrating the agony and

209
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.419
the ecstasy of being a self creating subject. So

210
00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:17.919
I think in, in Nietzsche much more than in

211
00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:22.770
Hegel, you get again the existential. Yeah, I'll say

212
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.309
it again, agony and ecstasy of the fact that

213
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.510
we have to create our own meaning where we

214
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.840
can't rely on the divine or on nature as

215
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:37.710
something separate from us to tell us what is

216
00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:40.539
meaningful, we have to do it ourselves. And that

217
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:43.789
um is a great privilege and honor, but also

218
00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:48.270
an enormous responsibility that I think in Nietzsche's view

219
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.729
more than in Hagel's only some people are really

220
00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:54.289
up to shouldering. So in, in each of them,

221
00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.849
you get the sense that lots of people would

222
00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:59.530
just really rather prefer to have others tell them

223
00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:03.450
what is meaningful. Um And our calling is to

224
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.590
resist that. I think Hagel, for instance, is much

225
00:14:06.599 --> 00:14:09.690
less interested in that kind of resistance and more

226
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.679
interested in trying to think of ourselves as a

227
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.159
cooperating group of people, each with our own subjectivities.

228
00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:19.869
But working out our subjectivity and our bid for

229
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.590
freedom very much with each other as opposed to

230
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.869
in the kind of individualistic way that you get

231
00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:26.609
with Nietzsche.

232
00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:31.659
That subjectivity part. I mean, what I'm going to

233
00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:34.750
say now, if I say something that you don't

234
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.710
agree with or you think is incorrect, please correct

235
00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:41.330
me. But uh I mean, of course, in someone

236
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.640
like Nietzsche and is to some extent, perspect perspective

237
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:51.780
is philosophy because he, he particularly in beyond good

238
00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.690
and evil, for example. And when and when it

239
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.739
comes to morality more specifically, there, there are places

240
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.700
in his work where he expresses a very uh

241
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:09.619
perspective perspective on, on things uh uh and things

242
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.580
seem to be very dependent on the subject and

243
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.280
subjectivity. But uh I mean, uh don't you think

244
00:15:18.289 --> 00:15:23.340
that even in Kent, particularly when uh in the

245
00:15:23.349 --> 00:15:28.450
critic of purism, he talks about, for example, the

246
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:34.190
limits of, of our uh o of the information

247
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.989
we can get from our senses, the uh th

248
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.169
those kinds of limits and, and also the fact

249
00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:46.619
that we uh sort of uh have some sort

250
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.710
of categories of understanding. And I think that some

251
00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:54.369
of them, they, it takes from, I guess Aristotle,

252
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.289
if I'm not mistaken and expands on them, I

253
00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:00.150
mean, the a and then the, and then also

254
00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:03.500
when he gets into the, the antinomy and he

255
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.299
talks about the things that even as through a

256
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:13.260
reasoning process cannot fully answer. Like for example, if

257
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.849
there's life after death, if there's a God, if

258
00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:19.369
the universe is infinite in time and space questions

259
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.950
like that. Uh I, I mean, that isn't there,

260
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.770
even if only a tiny seed of subjectivity planted

261
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.109
there because I mean, it seems that there's the

262
00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:37.799
thing in itself or whatever reality is and then

263
00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:41.760
our own limitations as human subjects when it comes

264
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:49.580
to perceiving it and getting an objective understanding of

265
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.780
what it is. I, I mean, I, I don't

266
00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:53.859
know, what are your thoughts on this?

267
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.969
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's 100% right? And I

268
00:16:56.979 --> 00:17:03.390
think that's a kind of radical postulate that I

269
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.550
don't even think Kant felt the existential weight of

270
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.310
which is to say it took someone. Well, I,

271
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.410
I, I'm much more familiar with the early romantics,

272
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.140
you know, the Schlegel and, and Schelling and, and

273
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:22.069
Novalis and Gunter Rode and people like that who

274
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.319
took that. I, I just feel like much more

275
00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.920
to heart and as you say, I think it

276
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.500
is partly dispositional or generational that, you know, can

277
00:17:31.589 --> 00:17:34.719
have laid those things out fairly matter of factly.

278
00:17:35.479 --> 00:17:38.140
But I think that the consequences for how we

279
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.900
think about our role in, on our responsibility in

280
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.420
the world and the radical perspect nature of that,

281
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:49.390
as you say, um was really exhilarating and upsetting

282
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.780
to more to the next generation of thinkers.

283
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.000
So getting into Hegel and specifically, of course, you've

284
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.939
already said a few things about him, but getting

285
00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:06.060
specifically to into aesthetics because when we think about

286
00:18:06.069 --> 00:18:09.729
Hegel, I mean, people who are not philosophers and

287
00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:15.780
not specifically very familiar with Hegel's philosophy, we tend

288
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:20.099
to just think about his more systematic and abstract

289
00:18:20.109 --> 00:18:27.500
approaches to history and uh uh thesis, antithesis synthesis

290
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.170
and stuff like that. But he also in fact

291
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.130
wrote about aesthetics.

292
00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:37.310
Yes. And that was part of his system for

293
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:41.449
sure. So um aesthetics is the first part of

294
00:18:41.459 --> 00:18:43.810
absolute spirit. So if you think of, of, you

295
00:18:43.819 --> 00:18:47.199
know, the system writ large, you've got um you

296
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.819
know, subjective spirit and the first you have logic

297
00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:52.010
and then you have philosophy of nature and then

298
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.310
in philosophy of spirit, you first have subjective spirit

299
00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:59.030
and then objective spirit and then absolute spirit. Absolute

300
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.069
spirit is where Hagel talks about the three ways

301
00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:06.969
that he thinks humans grapple with what it means

302
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.469
to be human. So the ways in which we

303
00:19:09.479 --> 00:19:14.130
reflect on um on the world, but also on

304
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.920
our role in the world. So the first of

305
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.489
those is art and then religion and then being

306
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.290
a philosopher, Hagel always has philosophy win at the

307
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.689
end. So philosophy for Hagel is still the best

308
00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:31.229
um most complete and most explicit way that humans

309
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:34.750
reckon with their um their own status and ask

310
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.119
themselves about meaning in the world. But art has

311
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.380
a really important place in that for Hagel because

312
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.020
we are embodied sensual beings. And contrary to what

313
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.660
some people think about Hagel, he doesn't regret that.

314
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.459
I mean, it isn't that if we could, we

315
00:19:52.469 --> 00:19:55.760
should get rid of that part of ourselves. I

316
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.500
think he thinks that that's a very rich and

317
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.859
very vital way in which humans remain part of

318
00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:06.040
the natural world. So we continue to feel and

319
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.670
smell and hear things um that are outside of

320
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.900
us. But we also use our senses to create

321
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.199
things that then mean something to us and that

322
00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:21.760
reflect our own grappling with that meaning. So I

323
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:27.719
think that for Hegel, aesthetics is the sensuous way

324
00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:31.839
of experiencing truth. So truth for Hegel again, back

325
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:36.199
to Spinoza is this very holistic view of the

326
00:20:36.209 --> 00:20:39.859
identity of identity and difference. So he says the

327
00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:42.920
true is the whole, it's the thing that brings

328
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.800
together contraries and this is where people get the

329
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.130
thesis sis synthesis um theme that you just referred

330
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.180
to. And so art is the way that we

331
00:20:55.189 --> 00:21:00.280
can sense that truth through our senses as opposed

332
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.869
to understanding it through narratives, which is the way

333
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.839
Hegel characterizes religion. So interestingly, religion for him is

334
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:11.369
primarily about narrative stories that we tell ourselves to

335
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.250
explain everything from the origin of the world to

336
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.339
um you know, our own relationship to each other

337
00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:20.670
through. And then philosophy is supposed to do that

338
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.520
without narrative and without our senses. So just through

339
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.510
thought. So then within aesthetics, Hagel's project is to

340
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.130
say how art does that and which kinds of

341
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.969
art and which particular instances of art do that

342
00:21:36.979 --> 00:21:40.319
best? So for him, the question always is, is

343
00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:44.030
this particular art form or this particular artwork allowing

344
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.510
us to sense the idea which is the unity

345
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.890
of unity and division or the true? That is

346
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.989
the whole. So he does this um in a

347
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.439
couple of ways. Um One by giving what some

348
00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:01.130
people call the first really philosophical history of art.

349
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.880
I always think people are too quick to assign

350
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.089
first to anything and usually when they do that,

351
00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:10.060
it's to a male European philosopher. And I think

352
00:22:10.069 --> 00:22:12.640
that is often not true. So I try to

353
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.229
be skeptical about that. Um BUT whether he was

354
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:19.540
first or not, he certainly had a very influential

355
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.140
idea of the sort of history and progress of

356
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.250
art. So that's in what's part two of his

357
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.319
lectures on the philosophy of art. And then he

358
00:22:28.339 --> 00:22:30.579
has a whole part three and I'm happy to

359
00:22:30.589 --> 00:22:33.719
get into it. This is one of my major

360
00:22:33.729 --> 00:22:36.000
claims in my book on Hagel's aesthetics is that

361
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.890
part three has been essentially neglected by HGL scholars.

362
00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:41.810
But that's where he talks about what he calls

363
00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:48.459
individual arts, which are architecture, sculpture, painting, music, and

364
00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:53.069
poetry. Importantly, in that order, because that's the order

365
00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:56.040
in which Hagel thinks he can explain how humans

366
00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.640
increasingly come to take ownership of their own um

367
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.790
art. So I'm happy to talk about that later.

368
00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:05.469
But anyway, so that's that in general um is

369
00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:08.599
where aesthetics and the philosophy of art fits in

370
00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:12.469
Hegel's system. And the, the other big claim that

371
00:23:12.479 --> 00:23:14.489
I make in my book on Hagel's aesthetics is

372
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.729
that we learn so much about Hagel's idealism through

373
00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:22.489
his aesthetics. So it's not just that OK, we

374
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.500
get Hagel's system and then when we have time,

375
00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:27.569
we can do the aesthetics. But if we don't

376
00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:31.619
understand the aesthetics, we don't understand really crucial things

377
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:36.660
about Hagel's theory of selfhood, about feeling about perception,

378
00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:39.489
like things that, that people usually talk about under

379
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.500
the heading of, you know, metaphysics or epistemology. Um

380
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.109
But I think there's a lot to learn about

381
00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:47.459
those more traditional fields. Um Well, see, I shouldn't

382
00:23:47.469 --> 00:23:50.459
even say traditional fields because that, that wasn't the

383
00:23:50.469 --> 00:23:54.089
case in Hegel's generation that people thought that metaphysics

384
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:58.290
and epistemology were like the core philosophical um enterprises

385
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.219
and aesthetics was just derivative really the opposite. Um

386
00:24:02.229 --> 00:24:04.579
So it's more because of the way philosophy developed,

387
00:24:04.589 --> 00:24:07.219
especially in the early 20th century that we've come

388
00:24:07.229 --> 00:24:09.680
to think that um again, so part of what

389
00:24:09.689 --> 00:24:11.420
I'm, what I try to do here is, is,

390
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.229
is reorient us towards thinking about it the other

391
00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:14.540
way.

392
00:24:15.189 --> 00:24:17.449
So there's something that you mentioned there that I

393
00:24:17.459 --> 00:24:20.189
would like to get more into. So, and, and

394
00:24:20.199 --> 00:24:22.770
please correct me if I'm wrong. But it seems

395
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.760
then that in a way uh the way Hegel

396
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:31.640
approaches aesthetics, I mean, it's not as some sort

397
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.689
of a separate field or domain from all the

398
00:24:36.699 --> 00:24:41.819
other domains of philosophy, like epistemology, probably ethics and

399
00:24:41.829 --> 00:24:45.770
metaphysics because uh I mean, isn't it also that

400
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:51.060
as Hegel uh understands art and aesthetics more generally,

401
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:56.540
that it ties very much to epistemology for example,

402
00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.910
and how we understand the world and how we

403
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.349
acquire knowledge about it.

404
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.599
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. So we don't, there are things

405
00:25:07.609 --> 00:25:10.150
that we can only sort of know through our

406
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.250
senses. So that's an epistemological question. And there are

407
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:19.250
ways in which our status as embodied beings can

408
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.069
only be known to us through our senses. And

409
00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:27.380
so if we don't talk about art, we're not

410
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.050
talking about a key part of epistemology. And I

411
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.270
think that Hagel has a pretty clear sense that

412
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.560
our senses are, uh again, it's not, sometimes people

413
00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.599
think that Hagel thinks that we'd be best if

414
00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:41.869
we were disembodied and I just think that's absolutely

415
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.719
false. Um So, in so far as part of

416
00:25:44.729 --> 00:25:47.800
what we know is embodied and there is such

417
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.300
a thing as embodied knowledge, this is where we

418
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.099
get it, we get it through aesthetics. And I

419
00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:56.939
should say, you know, strangely, especially coming after Kant

420
00:25:56.949 --> 00:26:01.579
and Shelling Hegel is completely uninterested in natural beauty.

421
00:26:01.589 --> 00:26:03.420
Like he just doesn't even really want to talk

422
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.930
about it. Um He, he is almost exclusively interested

423
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:10.650
in the philosophy of art and in aesthetics as

424
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.849
an artistic phenomenon. Um But other people have certainly

425
00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:18.119
talked a lot more about our aesthetic appreciation of

426
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.050
nature. And Schiller is a great example of that.

427
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.189
And it's always been very surprising to me that

428
00:26:23.199 --> 00:26:26.050
Hagel doesn't engage with that conversation in Schiller more

429
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.170
than he does. Um But yes, absolutely. Um So

430
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.329
like to give you an example when he talks

431
00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:37.180
about music, music for Hegel is the way we

432
00:26:37.189 --> 00:26:41.859
sense time. And if you think about Kant, talking

433
00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:45.250
about time is one of the two oper intuitions

434
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.260
through which that is necessary to our understanding the

435
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.579
world and having experience at all. For Hegel. Music

436
00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:54.430
is the thing that in the, in the most

437
00:26:54.439 --> 00:27:01.020
pure sense allows us to sense time and since

438
00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.500
time is so critical to selfhood, so there's no

439
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:08.030
selfhood without time in a way. He thinks that

440
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.869
music allows us to sense the self. I mean,

441
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.800
it doesn't get more root epistemological and metaphysical than

442
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.760
that. So what, what music allows us to do

443
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.729
is have this very pure sense of what is

444
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.189
so purely part of our existence, namely time. And

445
00:27:30.199 --> 00:27:35.239
that Hagel thinks is why music literally moves us,

446
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.400
I mean, literally and metaphorically. So you can be

447
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.939
moved by music emotionally. But Hagel himself says that

448
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.560
sometimes without knowing it, we'll start tapping our feet

449
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.390
when or moving our body. I love that image

450
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.780
of Hagel it like, you know, we tended to

451
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.819
give him as such a serious German philosopher and

452
00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:56.079
he was. But um but he himself recognizing that

453
00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:58.500
sometimes he couldn't help but move, you know, that

454
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.839
that's really uh deep, deep knowledge of ourselves. And

455
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:05.790
again, the knowledge without which I think Hagel thinks

456
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.310
our own understanding of ourselves would be impoverished.

457
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:12.030
That's all very interesting. I mean, oo one of

458
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.319
the things that I find fascinating about some philosophers

459
00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:21.119
is that nowadays through science, we are confirming some

460
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.300
of their ideas or intuitions, things that they've arrived

461
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.719
at uh without uh II, I mean, not through

462
00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:32.359
science as at least as we understand it today,

463
00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:35.520
of course. But for example, when you were talking

464
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:40.500
there about uh embodiment and embodied knowledge, I mean,

465
00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.515
nowadays, we have an entire field of embodied cognition

466
00:28:44.525 --> 00:28:50.194
and how we acquire knowledge through, not just through

467
00:28:50.204 --> 00:28:53.425
operations that occur in our brain, but through our

468
00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:56.344
brain being connected to the rest of our body

469
00:28:56.354 --> 00:28:58.714
and how we move in the world and the

470
00:28:58.724 --> 00:29:02.324
actions we do and how we interact with things.

471
00:29:02.334 --> 00:29:05.189
And I, I mean, it's really fascinating to me

472
00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:07.550
and uh I mean, as I said, I'm more

473
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.209
familiar with people like Nietzsche, but even Nietzsche, we

474
00:29:11.219 --> 00:29:15.040
could say was very much a philosopher of action.

475
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.859
I mean, he, he loved to walk a lot

476
00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:21.900
and thinking while he was walking and he talked

477
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.560
about doing philosopher, philosophy with a hammer and, and

478
00:29:27.569 --> 00:29:32.270
they very much admire people of action. And I,

479
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.599
I mean, doing things instead of just sitting and

480
00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:40.920
thinking and have this sort of more platonic vision

481
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.810
of things that perhaps we could or should in

482
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:48.410
a way try to disembody ourselves, which in a

483
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.260
way seems very, uh, uh, II, I mean, uh,

484
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.800
the, there's a very interesting caricature of that. I,

485
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.260
I don't know if you ever watched the movie,

486
00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.729
The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen. But there's a, there's

487
00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:07.020
a scene there played by Robin Williams where he's,

488
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.810
uh, uh, the king of the moon. I think

489
00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:11.599
it's the king of the moon, but the man

490
00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:15.030
on the moon and he can separate his head

491
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.800
from the rest of the body just to try

492
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:22.780
to become more enlightened and it doesn't really work.

493
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.619
So I think it's a very, uh, a very

494
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:32.089
funny parody of that sort of, uh disembodied idea

495
00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:36.339
of nationality or epistemology. So, yeah.

496
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.859
Yeah. And I do think that Hagel, despite his

497
00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:44.380
reputation, also resisted that kind of reification of reason

498
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.689
and of the mind. Um, AND, you know, there's

499
00:30:46.699 --> 00:30:49.020
a lot of that in his philosophy of subjective

500
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.689
spirit too when he talks about anthropology and um

501
00:30:52.699 --> 00:30:56.130
in psychology and ways in which our minds are

502
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.939
very formed by what happens around us. And it

503
00:30:58.949 --> 00:31:01.800
talks about insanity in those passages as being very

504
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.449
much tied to our embodied um existence. So there's,

505
00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:07.550
there's way more of that in HGL than most

506
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.849
people think. And again, I think the aesthetics are

507
00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:12.660
a wonderful way to get at that. I mean,

508
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.130
I'll, I'll say one other thing about it. I

509
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.000
think part of what Hagel really appreciated about art

510
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.630
is that we go through our everyday lives, sensing

511
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.380
things, but not being aware that we're sensing them.

512
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.079
So not being aware of ourselves as seeing and

513
00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:34.260
as hearing and as touching. And when we do

514
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.199
that, I think Hagel thinks we risk beginning to

515
00:31:37.209 --> 00:31:40.369
treat the world as something that's just out there

516
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.810
that's a given. You know, so mcdowell and Brandon

517
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:45.810
have been talking about this for a very long

518
00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:48.020
time. Mcdowell, especially the myth of the given, right?

519
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.060
So the world is out there and what epistemology

520
00:31:50.069 --> 00:31:54.439
is, is just our, like attaching our ideas to

521
00:31:54.489 --> 00:31:57.630
the outside world in uh in an accurate way.

522
00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.109
And I think Hagel thinks that that that happens

523
00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:04.089
in part just out of habit, of course. So

524
00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:06.369
when I walk by a tree, I can't every

525
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.489
time think, wow, I'm seeing a tree. And even

526
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.510
though, you know, it seems this way from this

527
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.750
perspective, it's actually a different way from that. Like

528
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.530
I'd never get through my day. Um But what

529
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.479
art does is remind us of what our senses

530
00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:26.089
are doing by disrupting that in really interesting ways.

531
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.160
So, and one example would be looking at a

532
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:34.530
painting and realizing that I can see three dimensions

533
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.390
where there aren't three dimensions. And that tells me

534
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.780
something about the interaction of my mind with the

535
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.310
world. So we might think of a painting is

536
00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:47.229
a paradigmatic example of something that just exists independently

537
00:32:47.239 --> 00:32:50.410
outside of us. But actually for it to exist

538
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.859
as a painting, there has to be someone looking

539
00:32:53.869 --> 00:32:56.949
at it and perceiving it in a certain way.

540
00:32:57.709 --> 00:33:00.689
And Hagel thinks that that kind of mutual formation

541
00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:03.959
between the self and the world actually is what

542
00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:06.969
is true of us all day, every day. But

543
00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:08.930
we get used to it, it becomes and this

544
00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:12.410
is a really important technical term for him. Prosaic,

545
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.810
right? We start to treat it as just sort

546
00:33:14.819 --> 00:33:20.369
of normal and given and, and, and as existing

547
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.109
independently of us. And what art reminds us is

548
00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:26.949
that in fact, everything that we sense and everything

549
00:33:26.959 --> 00:33:29.760
that we do is part of our mutual engagement

550
00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.099
and formation with the world. And I think Hegel

551
00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:37.540
famously doesn't articulate a theory of aesthetic experience the

552
00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.459
way Khan does. So, Kant says, you know, it's

553
00:33:40.469 --> 00:33:42.910
the playing of the faculties and that's part of

554
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.959
why it gives us pleasure is because it gives

555
00:33:44.969 --> 00:33:47.579
us a break from our kind of prosaic parsing

556
00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:50.170
of the world Hagel doesn't ever actually say that.

557
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.680
But I think what he implies is that when

558
00:33:54.689 --> 00:33:59.680
we are disrupted, out of our prosaic attitude towards

559
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:02.900
the world into a more aesthetic attitude towards it,

560
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.300
we're actually sensing truth in a way that we

561
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.938
don't otherwise. So if I go from just seeing

562
00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.239
the tree to having an aesthetic experience of the

563
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.600
tree, that's actually a more true experience of the

564
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.938
tree. And that's part of what gives me joy.

565
00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:22.219
So I think that's part of what Hagel thinks

566
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.860
is going on in all kinds of aesthetic pleasure.

567
00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:29.478
So uh there was a point there uh in

568
00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:34.100
my previous question where you mentioned the fact that

569
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.080
at a certain point in his work on aesthetics,

570
00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:41.188
Hegel talks about how humans can take ownership of

571
00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:46.129
their art through specific kinds of art. Could you

572
00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.129
tell us a little bit more about that?

573
00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.658
Yeah. So this is behind his trajectory from architecture

574
00:34:53.668 --> 00:34:57.188
to sculpture to what he calls or actually it's

575
00:34:57.198 --> 00:35:00.039
one of his um editors. But anyway, the three

576
00:35:00.049 --> 00:35:04.128
romantic arts which are painting music and poetry. So,

577
00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:09.089
and many other philosophers like Herder had put art

578
00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:12.009
into a different trajectory. So I think one really

579
00:35:12.019 --> 00:35:14.618
good way of trying to figure out what Hagel

580
00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:17.089
is up to is to compare those and and

581
00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:19.208
you know, why does he put what at the

582
00:35:19.218 --> 00:35:24.860
top? Um So for Hegel architecture is the art

583
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.260
form that feels most externalized to humans, right? So

584
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:33.840
it's big in scope. It's also usually functional, although

585
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.929
he often, he also talks about architecture that's not

586
00:35:35.939 --> 00:35:39.489
functional. Um And it, it has to do primarily

587
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.719
with matter that seems independent of humans. So stone

588
00:35:44.729 --> 00:35:50.689
or brick or wood and then sculpture also has

589
00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:54.870
a more um and an externalized material. So whether

590
00:35:54.879 --> 00:35:59.399
that's marble or plaster or whatever, but in sculpture,

591
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:02.530
at least paradigmatic sculpture as Hagel understands it, humans

592
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.570
start to reflect themselves in it. So paradigmatic sculpture

593
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.659
for Hegel is ancient Greek sculpture where um humans

594
00:36:13.669 --> 00:36:20.600
are no longer making uh like monstrous, exaggerated forms,

595
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.100
but more just straight up human forms. So that's,

596
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.439
that's more attention to the human and more attention

597
00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:29.120
to the subjective. And then when you get to

598
00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:34.060
painting music and poetry, you're increasingly focusing humans attention

599
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:38.879
on what's going on inside of them as arts

600
00:36:38.889 --> 00:36:43.179
material. So color doesn't, I mean, it's let me

601
00:36:43.189 --> 00:36:45.500
put it this way. It's more obvious to us

602
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:49.310
that color doesn't exist in the world the way

603
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.100
that stone exists in the world. OK. So Hagel

604
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.409
still doesn't think that we should talk about stone

605
00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:59.050
as existing independently of us. But leaving that aside,

606
00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:04.790
painting more obviously points out to us our involvement

607
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.659
in whatever is painted. And so I already talked

608
00:37:07.669 --> 00:37:10.179
about like perspective, but that's true also of color.

609
00:37:10.189 --> 00:37:12.909
And Hagel likes to talk about how it's possible

610
00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:15.260
for a human to see a form like a

611
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:20.459
human, not even by drawing, but just by juxtaposing

612
00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:23.590
colors against each other. So even if there isn't

613
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.189
a human form drawn, if you juxtapose the colors,

614
00:37:26.419 --> 00:37:30.739
a human will see a drawing where there isn't

615
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.030
one, right? So again, more activity on the part

616
00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.540
of the subject and then music, as I was

617
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.820
saying a minute ago, same thing. Music is totally

618
00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.510
interior, right? So there we can't really talk about

619
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.750
any material that's outside, like we can talk about

620
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.350
the instruments, but the instruments aren't the music and

621
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.280
they certainly aren't my experience of the music. So

622
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:57.560
that's totally interior and then poetry. So Hagel and

623
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.219
this is one of the the interesting differences between

624
00:38:00.229 --> 00:38:03.780
Hagel and other philosophers including Schopenhauer, right? So Schopenhauer

625
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.979
puts music at the top because he wants really

626
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.949
to highlight that kind of subjectivity. But Hagel is

627
00:38:10.959 --> 00:38:16.010
always interested in the unity of identity and difference,

628
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.659
right? So he doesn't want to stop at subjectivity.

629
00:38:18.669 --> 00:38:22.580
He wants to go back to integrating subjectivity back

630
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.689
into objectivity. And so when we get to poetry,

631
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:31.810
we have um something that's 100% human creation, namely

632
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:38.310
language as material, but it's, it's not as subjective

633
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.489
as music because language is something that you and

634
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.030
I have to agree on on some level. Otherwise

635
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.909
it wouldn't count as language if I just start,

636
00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:52.340
you know, speaking gibberish, that might be my private

637
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.179
language, but it's not going to function like language

638
00:38:55.189 --> 00:38:58.800
unless I'm in dialogue, literally, not just with one

639
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.139
person, but with a whole culture. So then when

640
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:05.239
we get to as a kind of poetry, which

641
00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:09.239
then embodies language as this very human creation and

642
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:15.070
this very mutually formed creation back into action, right?

643
00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.760
So then you have characters embodied characters back to

644
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:23.909
embodiment, embodied characters on a stage using language that's

645
00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:26.590
been mutually agreed upon, not just between individuals but

646
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.610
by a culture. Then Hagel thinks we've got a

647
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:37.010
really profound experience of collective aesthetic creation that can

648
00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.770
unite us as a community while also showcasing the

649
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.669
kind of subjectivity that a character like Antigone or

650
00:39:46.679 --> 00:39:51.780
Hamlet is experiencing. So, um so that's the way

651
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.280
in which Hagel, that's why Hagel orders them the

652
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.379
way he orders them and decides that drama is

653
00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:02.500
the most complete form of aesthetic experience, which does

654
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.090
not. And we'll probably get to this in a

655
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.969
minute. Um Mean that he thinks that it's the

656
00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:12.280
best form of art, but it is the highest

657
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.959
aesthetic experience philosophically for humans.

658
00:40:16.159 --> 00:40:18.770
You know, uh while you were talking, I was

659
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.709
thinking at a certain point because you mentioned Schopenhauer

660
00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:26.179
there that uh if um uh I mean, of

661
00:40:26.189 --> 00:40:29.620
course, you probably already alluded to some of that

662
00:40:29.629 --> 00:40:33.459
in your answer. But uh I was wondering what

663
00:40:33.469 --> 00:40:38.929
extent Hegel's statics also connects to his metaphysics because

664
00:40:38.939 --> 00:40:41.820
when you mentioned Schopenhauer, I mean, Schopenhauer is um

665
00:40:42.469 --> 00:40:47.439
a, at least for us more modern contemporary people,

666
00:40:47.449 --> 00:40:51.060
it's a bit of a weird idea. But uh

667
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.000
if, if I understand it correctly. I think that,

668
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:59.280
uh OK, so, um Schopenhauer took that division from

669
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.780
Kent, uh the division between the Neuman and, and

670
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:07.330
the phenomenon and the phenomenons uh the Ninon sorry,

671
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.340
supposedly is what reality itself is. I mean, the

672
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:16.620
fundamental nature of reality. And uh and this is

673
00:41:16.629 --> 00:41:19.659
also something I, I guess that Nietzsche talks about

674
00:41:19.669 --> 00:41:22.435
in the, the origin of tragedy because back then

675
00:41:22.445 --> 00:41:25.635
in his first book, he was already very much

676
00:41:25.735 --> 00:41:30.945
influenced by Schopenhauer. He then uh uh left some

677
00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:34.475
of that out of his philosophy later on. But

678
00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:39.735
uh didn't Schopenhauer have this sort of idea that

679
00:41:39.814 --> 00:41:45.754
music itself was part of the fundamental nature of

680
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:46.514
reality.

681
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:51.370
Yeah. Absolutely. And that, and for Schopenhauer, the reason

682
00:41:51.379 --> 00:41:53.610
we love music so much and the reason it

683
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.830
moves us so much is because it is the

684
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.229
most raw experience of reality we can get. And

685
00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:04.989
uh absolutely, it, it moves us because it is

686
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.429
also, you know, and this is, I think is,

687
00:42:06.439 --> 00:42:08.310
is the kind of thing Hagel thought too that

688
00:42:08.899 --> 00:42:11.439
the joy that we get in it and in

689
00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:14.399
and its immediate access to our emotions so that

690
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:19.629
music can make us sad about nothing, right? So

691
00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:21.639
it's not if I listen to sad music, I'm

692
00:42:21.649 --> 00:42:26.320
not sad about anything. I'm just sad. That's incredible.

693
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.820
Like the fact that that's possible. Schopenhauer thinks says

694
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.419
something really profound about the nature of reality and

695
00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:36.959
about the nature of being human. And I think

696
00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:38.939
Hagel is attuned to that as well. And it

697
00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:44.290
doesn't be again because he's more interested in thinking

698
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.580
about a society in which people work together. I

699
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.520
mean, Hagel, I sometimes say to my students is

700
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:52.760
just more interested in like making sure that the

701
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.600
society functions. And so he's, he's much more interested

702
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.540
in saying, OK, what institutions are going to be

703
00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:01.760
necessary for us to create a society in which

704
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.939
humans can live to their full potential. And someone

705
00:43:03.949 --> 00:43:06.209
like Schopenhauer, as I understand him is, is just

706
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.709
much less interested in that. So I think Hagel

707
00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.719
wants to pull back from this kind of ra

708
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:15.760
education of subjectivity and say, OK, it's really good.

709
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.260
It's really important fundamental to modern humans. Now, we've

710
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.000
got to show how it can be fostered within

711
00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.860
institutions. And so I think that's part of why

712
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.889
um music doesn't top the list for him and

713
00:43:31.899 --> 00:43:34.780
to your original question about metaphysics. Absolutely. I mean,

714
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.790
this is the structure of reality as far as

715
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.800
Hagel is concerned, the identity of identity and difference.

716
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.810
And so the, the way in which the trajectory

717
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.770
of the arts, including music's subordinate place to drama

718
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.620
into poetry in general is a metaphysical commitment on

719
00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:54.969
Hagel's part. Absolutely.

720
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:59.669
Uh And uh I mean, you mentioned drama there.

721
00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:04.850
Uh Did Hegel have specific views about tragedy and

722
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.469
comedy?

723
00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:09.469
Yes, this is something I thought about a lot.

724
00:44:09.479 --> 00:44:13.889
Um And probably many of your viewers will know

725
00:44:13.899 --> 00:44:16.399
that Hagel is most famous for talking about tragedy.

726
00:44:16.409 --> 00:44:20.469
So his interpretation of antigone has been in particular,

727
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.439
very influential. And I mean, the thousands of pages

728
00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:26.500
that have been written on that are testament to

729
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.270
how, how important and revelatory his theory of tragedy

730
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.629
was. But um much less attention has been paid

731
00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:36.379
to his theory of comedy. And so I got

732
00:44:36.389 --> 00:44:38.709
really interested in that at a certain point. Um

733
00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:41.500
Both what Hagel says about comedy and why it

734
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:45.919
has been um not taken as seriously, really quick

735
00:44:45.929 --> 00:44:48.649
answer to the second question that's just really typical

736
00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:53.129
that philosophers um tend to take serious things more

737
00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:57.459
seriously. And unless you want to take comedy seriously

738
00:44:57.469 --> 00:45:03.040
and therefore risk being comic yourself because how ridiculous

739
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.419
is it to take comedy seriously? Um People don't

740
00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:08.360
do it. I, I have uh spent probably more

741
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.510
time in my life than I should taking comedy

742
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.679
very seriously. I teach a course on it. Um

743
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.850
And that, that is in part because I, yeah,

744
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:19.739
I got interested in what Hagel says about tragedy

745
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.169
and comedy. So in short, and I'm much more

746
00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:23.830
focused on what he says about it in his

747
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.879
lectures on aesthetics rather than what he says in

748
00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.320
the phenomenology. But I do think they are, they

749
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:34.139
are connected tragedy for Hegel shows a kind of

750
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:41.739
subjectivity, very entrenched in itself and in roles in

751
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.860
particular in like social roles. So if you think

752
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.860
about antigone, she is struggling with her role as

753
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:52.169
a daughter and as a sister and as a

754
00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:55.459
subject, right? So her brothers have been killed, she

755
00:45:55.469 --> 00:45:57.280
wants to bury one of them. She feels that

756
00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:01.129
that's her duty. Her uncle, the king is also

757
00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:03.600
her king now and she's supposed to obey him

758
00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.030
and he forbids this, um, since one of her

759
00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.550
brothers was a traitor. So the, the tragedy there

760
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.300
is between two people who are deeply invested in

761
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:15.169
their subjective relationships to their roles and those roles

762
00:46:15.179 --> 00:46:18.020
are incompatible. So there's no way for it to

763
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:22.409
end without one of them dying. Um It's not

764
00:46:22.419 --> 00:46:24.600
several people die, but you know, of the two

765
00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.429
of them, only one of them dies. And so

766
00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:29.540
I, but in so far as Hegel is always

767
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:33.030
interested in the unity of unity and division. What

768
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.300
you get there is two people whose conflict with

769
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.179
each other cancels itself out and then what you

770
00:46:40.189 --> 00:46:42.689
get at the end the synthesis. Although Hagel doesn't

771
00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:45.340
use that word is the survival of the Greek

772
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:51.540
City state with increased knowledge of how those roles

773
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.459
have to be treated within the Polish. So Creon

774
00:46:54.469 --> 00:46:57.659
ends the play essentially admitting that he shouldn't have

775
00:46:57.669 --> 00:47:01.090
had the attitude that he had to his role.

776
00:47:01.419 --> 00:47:05.649
So, so for Hagel, the reason that tragedy is

777
00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:09.439
art is because it shows this clash, which ends

778
00:47:09.449 --> 00:47:15.959
in a kind of unification comedy, also ancient comedy

779
00:47:15.969 --> 00:47:21.639
and Hagel's favorite is Aristophanes also ends in reunification.

780
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.770
But it's because like if you take streps sides

781
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.919
as an example in the clouds, he doesn't take

782
00:47:27.929 --> 00:47:30.770
himself so seriously. So he, you know, kind of

783
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.550
goofs around and he undermines the city and then,

784
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.800
you know, he cheats and he, and he's never

785
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.840
like fixed on his role and that gives him

786
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.709
an enormous amount of power. And so in the

787
00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:46.169
clouds, in particular, you also see the, like the

788
00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:48.409
beginning of the erosion of the idea that the

789
00:47:48.419 --> 00:47:51.729
gods are really in control because they're being mocked

790
00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:53.870
in strips and, and they had been before, this

791
00:47:53.879 --> 00:47:57.110
isn't new in Aristophanes necessarily. But at the end

792
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.409
of that, you get a kind of cheerful reunification.

793
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:05.050
And Hegel actually says, um at another point, you

794
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.649
know, maybe that's better, you know, why would we

795
00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:15.169
choose the dark and um desperate conflict of tragedy

796
00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:18.729
over the cheerful life affirming? And I think there's

797
00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:21.100
a lot of this in Nietzsche too, life affirming

798
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.600
laughter of someone who doesn't have to be so

799
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.570
beholden to his roles that he's willing to bring

800
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.840
the whole society down around him. So there's a,

801
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:32.979
there's a, an extended story that I'm happy to

802
00:48:32.989 --> 00:48:36.989
tell if, if you're interested um about how that

803
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.360
changes in modern tragedy and modern comedy. Um But

804
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.780
Hagel is pretty pessimistic about both mo modern tragedy

805
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:48.389
and modern comedy. Um And essentially, I think, thinks

806
00:48:48.399 --> 00:48:51.229
that we're going to have to transcend both of

807
00:48:51.239 --> 00:48:53.969
them or, and this is another big topic, move

808
00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:56.719
to more of a humor based aesthetic than a

809
00:48:57.149 --> 00:48:59.389
comedy based aesthetic,

810
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.590
right? Uh I'm going to ask you more about

811
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.629
that, about modern comedy and tragedy in a second.

812
00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:07.370
But I, I mean, I just wanted to make

813
00:49:07.379 --> 00:49:11.090
a brief comment because this was to some extent,

814
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.860
I mean, uh the, the way people like Hegel,

815
00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:18.239
Schopenhauer Nietzsche and others in the 19th century approached

816
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.020
uh aesthetics and art uh somewhat reminds me of

817
00:49:23.479 --> 00:49:29.860
uh how dismissive uh the post Socratic were of

818
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:34.219
the Pres Socratic because the Pre Socratic took the

819
00:49:34.229 --> 00:49:38.620
poets and uh seriously when it comes to uh

820
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:42.820
I mean, perhaps uh also being able to acquire

821
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:47.580
some sort of knowledge through art, through fiction and

822
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.300
all of that. And I, and I, and I

823
00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:51.739
mean, of course, I, I don't think we can

824
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.939
really be sure about what part of it came

825
00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:58.770
from Socrates or Plato because sometimes we don't know

826
00:49:58.919 --> 00:50:03.020
for sure if it's Socrates or Plato talking, but

827
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:08.114
in Plato's works. But anyway, I, I mean, the

828
00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:12.425
Socrates and the, the other Greek philosophers who came

829
00:50:12.435 --> 00:50:17.745
after him were very dismissive of Homer specifically and

830
00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:20.965
the other poets. And when you think about the

831
00:50:20.975 --> 00:50:25.614
Pres Socratic and even what we call the Sophists,

832
00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:29.004
I, I mean, nowadays, sophistry has a very negative

833
00:50:29.014 --> 00:50:33.264
connotation to it, but the Sophists were very much

834
00:50:33.274 --> 00:50:37.389
philosophers themselves, I think. Uh SO I, I wa

835
00:50:37.399 --> 00:50:39.620
I was just, I mean, it just came to

836
00:50:39.629 --> 00:50:43.320
my mind that uh there are, there have been

837
00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:48.959
periods in Western philosophy, where people have very much

838
00:50:48.969 --> 00:50:52.925
been dismissive of art, at least as a potential

839
00:50:52.935 --> 00:50:57.405
source of some kind of knowledge and others where

840
00:50:57.415 --> 00:51:04.754
people really engaged with art seriously and philosophically took

841
00:51:04.764 --> 00:51:06.324
art seriously.

842
00:51:06.514 --> 00:51:09.155
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And I think this is the

843
00:51:09.165 --> 00:51:12.114
19th century, is one place where that pen direction.

844
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.449
So tell us about the issues that Hegel had

845
00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:24.399
with modern forms of art, particularly uh with what

846
00:51:24.409 --> 00:51:28.889
we could call, I guess modern subjectivity in art

847
00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:32.320
because uh as time went on and particularly since

848
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:35.459
the, I guess, more or less the 19th century

849
00:51:35.469 --> 00:51:39.399
onwards, I mean, in literature and other forms of

850
00:51:39.409 --> 00:51:46.270
art, we see people focusing more on particular characters

851
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.004
and character development and there's objectivity even what goes

852
00:51:51.014 --> 00:51:55.225
on in their minds through ex through lots and

853
00:51:55.235 --> 00:51:59.764
lots of, of, of texts sometimes just focusing on

854
00:51:59.774 --> 00:52:02.284
their inner thoughts and all of that. II, I

855
00:52:02.294 --> 00:52:07.094
guess that's what we could call a modern subjectivity

856
00:52:07.104 --> 00:52:10.354
in art to uh or perhaps there's also some

857
00:52:10.364 --> 00:52:14.824
other forms of subjectivity. But what did Hegel think

858
00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:15.344
about it?

859
00:52:16.189 --> 00:52:18.810
I think one of the best places to isolate

860
00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.290
that is in what he says about humor. And

861
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:26.330
yeah, and I think humor was a really new

862
00:52:26.669 --> 00:52:30.899
aesthetic phenomenon. It essentially began with Lawrence Stern's Tristam

863
00:52:30.909 --> 00:52:35.330
Shandy, which was enormously popular in Germany. I mean,

864
00:52:35.439 --> 00:52:40.129
Goethe and Schiller and Lessing and anybody who was

865
00:52:40.139 --> 00:52:46.330
anybody um loved Stern and his evocation of characters

866
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.419
who were not comic in the classic sense of

867
00:52:50.429 --> 00:52:54.620
like, Aristophanes. Um, BUT were kind of quirky and

868
00:52:54.629 --> 00:52:59.879
had foibles and eccentricities that made you kind of

869
00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:03.399
gently laugh at them. So, not mock them, not

870
00:53:03.649 --> 00:53:11.199
guffaw but, but just recognize how much humans get

871
00:53:11.209 --> 00:53:14.439
obsessed with what stern called their hobby horses. Like

872
00:53:14.449 --> 00:53:17.590
their little things that they're, the, the little things

873
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.530
that they wanna be obsessed about. So, you know,

874
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.719
whether it's your train set or his, you know,

875
00:53:21.729 --> 00:53:26.360
his uncle's military, uh what was it? It wasn't

876
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:30.770
exactly a like models, I guess. Anyway, um So

877
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:34.110
Hagel thought that comedy and, and humor needed to

878
00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.000
be differentiated as, as did um pretty much everybody

879
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:40.310
in his um generation. So comedy as a kind

880
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.209
of dramatic art form and humor as something that

881
00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:49.939
more suffused literature and poetry and that highlighted again

882
00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:52.679
this sense that what is really important to pay

883
00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:57.449
attention to among humans now is that since we've

884
00:53:57.459 --> 00:54:00.070
discovered as it were that we are the source

885
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.590
of meaning in the world, what is meaningful to

886
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.360
us and how kind of adorably silly that often

887
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:11.560
is like how adorably silly many of our concerns

888
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.409
are. And I think Hegel thought that was really

889
00:54:14.419 --> 00:54:20.189
valuable aesthetically because it brought attention to, you know,

890
00:54:20.199 --> 00:54:23.870
the the concerns of art are no longer the

891
00:54:23.879 --> 00:54:28.649
gods or big battles or even like sublime landscapes,

892
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:32.699
but like Dutch genre paintings or still lifes that

893
00:54:32.709 --> 00:54:38.409
show tiny little involved human obsessions with flowers or

894
00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:41.459
having your tooth pulled or, you know, like everyday

895
00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:45.169
human things, but he did not like it when

896
00:54:45.179 --> 00:54:49.770
people became so subjective that they didn't try to

897
00:54:50.729 --> 00:54:54.290
extract any larger meaning from whatever it was that

898
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.290
they were doing. So he was very critical of

899
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.050
Jean Paul Richter on this point, very critical of

900
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.580
people like Schlegel, Friedrich Schlegel. And you know, to

901
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:08.750
a lesser extent, people like Novalis who Hagel thought

902
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.209
were way too focused on their own interiority and

903
00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:16.189
stream of consciousness essentially as you were just describing

904
00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:20.709
and therefore, again, never made the connection back from

905
00:55:20.719 --> 00:55:25.909
subjectivity back into objectivity and therefore, were not giving

906
00:55:25.919 --> 00:55:30.070
their audiences an experience of the truth. So that's

907
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.830
always what's at stake for Hagel. Um So he's

908
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.040
very critical of what he calls subjective humor and

909
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.790
very admiring of what he calls objective humor.

910
00:55:40.399 --> 00:55:43.389
Do you think that Hagel would have been a,

911
00:55:43.399 --> 00:55:47.699
a fan? Or at least like to some extent

912
00:55:47.709 --> 00:55:54.439
the existentialists, do you think that Hegel would have

913
00:55:54.449 --> 00:55:58.320
been a, a fan or at least like to

914
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:01.340
some extent the existentialists?

915
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.550
I'm not so sure he would have been to

916
00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.409
be honest with you. I think he, he, as

917
00:56:10.419 --> 00:56:13.020
I said earlier, he was really interested in making

918
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.729
a society function on an institutional level. So what

919
00:56:16.739 --> 00:56:18.689
kind of form of government do we need? What

920
00:56:18.699 --> 00:56:21.719
kind of um social order, what kind of economic

921
00:56:21.729 --> 00:56:25.629
order, what kind of family situation and in so

922
00:56:25.639 --> 00:56:30.350
far as existentialists and this is generalizing but often

923
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:36.300
emphasize the subject in opposition to those things. I

924
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:39.530
think Hagel would have again, felt like, well, but

925
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.790
what we're after here is truth, which is the

926
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.560
unity of unity and division, not just division. And

927
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.409
we have a world to run like it's our

928
00:56:47.419 --> 00:56:50.969
responsibility to run this world. There's no God out

929
00:56:50.979 --> 00:56:53.250
there to help us out, there's no natural order

930
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.870
like we've got to get this right. And if

931
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:59.689
there's, and again, this is to caricature. But if

932
00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:04.209
existentialists are sometimes seen as self obsessed or just

933
00:57:04.219 --> 00:57:08.449
as oppositional to the order, I think Hagel would

934
00:57:08.459 --> 00:57:11.590
have been much more interested in reforming the order

935
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.209
in ways that would better allow humans to be

936
00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:17.270
free and the way he thought humans needed to

937
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.030
be free. And that back to something we were

938
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.929
saying a minute ago, I think this is something

939
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:24.050
that Marx picks up from. Hagel is very much

940
00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:28.919
about what kind of material conditions do humans need

941
00:57:28.929 --> 00:57:31.250
in order to be free. So it's not enough

942
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.909
to say as Kant did um that you're free

943
00:57:34.919 --> 00:57:36.899
if you're self determining and can act against your

944
00:57:36.909 --> 00:57:40.750
inclinations in accordance with the categorical imperative. I realize

945
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.270
that Kant scholars are going to say that that's

946
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.149
not all he meant. And, and I accept that,

947
00:57:44.159 --> 00:57:47.080
but Hagel was much more explicit in trying to

948
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:50.560
say what real freedom means is paying attention to

949
00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:55.659
what people need in institutions around them. And you

950
00:57:55.669 --> 00:57:58.110
know, just life forms around them in order to

951
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.929
be, to flourish as humans with dignity and respect.

952
00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:04.939
So again, that's maybe too hard on the existentialist.

953
00:58:04.949 --> 00:58:07.830
But I, I think that might be his general

954
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.439
take.

955
00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:12.639
That's very interesting because o of course, we know

956
00:58:12.649 --> 00:58:16.679
that Marx was influenced by Hegel to some extent,

957
00:58:16.899 --> 00:58:21.979
but sometimes because people have these simplistic views of

958
00:58:22.239 --> 00:58:25.489
Hegel and Marx they think, oh, how could it

959
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:30.189
be? Because Hegel was supposedly a big idealist and

960
00:58:30.199 --> 00:58:33.250
Marx was a me realist. I mean, how could

961
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.360
they be more opposite? But uh I mean, what

962
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:39.909
you mentioned there and uh Hegel caring very much

963
00:58:39.919 --> 00:58:44.949
about how we structure society, about the institutions we

964
00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:49.270
create and how we create them based on what

965
00:58:49.479 --> 00:58:54.000
values, I guess. Uh I mean, it's very much

966
00:58:54.010 --> 00:59:00.280
uh I guess also applied philosophy or political philosophy

967
00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:04.100
as some of what Marx also cared about.

968
00:59:04.439 --> 00:59:07.649
Absolutely. And I, you know, I think another thing

969
00:59:07.659 --> 00:59:10.300
that you can find in Hegel that I think

970
00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:13.500
is just much more clearly articulated in Marx is

971
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:17.750
that freedom can be a kind of ideological lie

972
00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:21.790
if you continue to tell people that they're free

973
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.989
as a way of distracting them from the fact

974
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.989
that they're being exploited and alienated, right? So if

975
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.370
you make people focus on, yes, but I'm a

976
00:59:31.379 --> 00:59:33.340
free and determining being because I can follow the

977
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:36.750
categorical imperative, which I, I again, that's a caricature.

978
00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:40.389
Um Then people are going to feel like, well,

979
00:59:40.399 --> 00:59:43.800
you know, who cares what sort of deprived economic

980
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:46.870
situation I live in. I'm still free and Hagel,

981
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:50.489
I think, worried that that kind, that, that kind

982
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.350
of idea could fall into the wrong hands of

983
00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.649
people who knew how to manipulate it. Such that

984
00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:59.739
exactly as you said, you know, you can be

985
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:01.979
a, a worker who's being totally exploited. But as

986
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:04.530
long as you're told that there's a kind of

987
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:09.260
freedom that exists in transcending that or not caring

988
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.810
about it or, or that actually, you know what

989
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.909
it is to be human is to, to subsist

990
01:00:14.919 --> 01:00:18.790
despite the struggle of economic depravity, I think Hagel

991
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.000
also would say that's just, that's manipulative, it's deceitful

992
01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.830
and it's unethical. Uh IT'S, it's, it is not,

993
01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.370
it is false freedom, it is empty, fake, false

994
01:00:28.379 --> 01:00:30.919
freedom. And it can be a kind of uh

995
01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:33.189
a tool in the hands of people who want

996
01:00:33.199 --> 01:00:36.030
to manipulate others into ignoring the ways in which

997
01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.939
they're being exploited,

998
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:40.399
which is very interesting because I guess that this

999
01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:43.600
is also another idea that people do not tend

1000
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:48.070
at all to associate with Hegel. But as Marx,

1001
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.030
he also cared about the poverty, right? And about

1002
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.520
the causes of poverty and the potential effects it

1003
01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.929
would have on people's behavior. Correct.

1004
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.949
Yeah. So this is specifically in the passages where

1005
01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:05.010
he talks about what's called the rabble. And, and

1006
01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.270
I think this is again, a distinction that Marx

1007
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.600
picks up on that what Hagel means by the

1008
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:14.639
rabble is not just people who are impoverished. So

1009
01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.489
and Hagel, like many people thinks that there will

1010
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:24.389
always be poverty. But what's new since, you know,

1011
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.280
well, not new now, but new since the modern

1012
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:32.199
world essentially is the claim that all humans are

1013
01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:37.020
worthy of dignity and respect and the acknowledgement or

1014
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:42.010
just the fact that our economies are human creations.

1015
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.939
So whereas poverty before could be explained just by

1016
01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:48.979
natural phenomenon or just by a hierarchy that we

1017
01:01:48.989 --> 01:01:50.969
were told was natural. You know, the king gets

1018
01:01:50.979 --> 01:01:52.610
to be rich and you have to be poor

1019
01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:55.989
because God made him the king and made you

1020
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.489
a pauper. Now, the combination of the claim that

1021
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.709
all humans are worthy of dignity and respect and

1022
01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.629
a human created economy, that means that many people

1023
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:12.370
live in total depravity generates a kind of rage

1024
01:02:12.379 --> 01:02:15.550
on the part of what Hagel then calls the

1025
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.949
rabble. Um THAT is entirely justified and that Hagel

1026
01:02:18.959 --> 01:02:22.340
sees as a pretty existential threat to modern society

1027
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.399
because they're right, right. It's, it's not that we

1028
01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.679
need them to get over this fact that they're

1029
01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:31.000
right about it. And as long as that's true,

1030
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:34.439
they, you know, society will be unstable because they

1031
01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:39.600
will correctly demand the material conditions. For the thing

1032
01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:43.439
that they're told is their kind of existential, right.

1033
01:02:43.959 --> 01:02:47.399
So in HGL talks about ways to solve that

1034
01:02:47.409 --> 01:02:51.139
through essentially what we would call labor unions or

1035
01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:55.969
other forms within civil society that would and within

1036
01:02:55.979 --> 01:03:01.560
the government that would represent not just geographical interests

1037
01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:04.429
but economic interests. So when, when you look at

1038
01:03:04.439 --> 01:03:06.520
what Hagel says about the form the state should

1039
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:09.110
take, I think one of the most overlooked facts

1040
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:14.030
is that he does not want purely geographical representation.

1041
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:16.760
He doesn't want, you know, Prussia gets two delegates

1042
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:19.080
and Bavaria gets two delegates and no following is

1043
01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:23.870
two delegates but that different classes and different kinds

1044
01:03:23.879 --> 01:03:28.810
of um of industry get representation. So that to

1045
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.729
me is very clear evidence that he was worried

1046
01:03:31.739 --> 01:03:36.070
about not just the material conditions of capitalism, but

1047
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.709
also the questions of identity and self-respect that are

1048
01:03:40.719 --> 01:03:44.060
necessary in the modern work world um that are

1049
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.810
essentially trampled on by capitalism.

1050
01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:52.350
And so um could we say that Hegel like

1051
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.810
Marx was also or thought that it was a

1052
01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.229
moral imperative for society to try as best as

1053
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.370
we could to alleviate or ideally eradicate poverty?

1054
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.260
Yeah, absolutely. I I don't think Hale thought it

1055
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:12.209
could be completely eradicated. But um yeah, I there's

1056
01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:14.260
no question in my mind that he saw this

1057
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:18.149
as the deepest and most insidious kind of hypocrisy

1058
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:21.209
that a society would say on the one hand

1059
01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.679
that everyone is equal and deserving of dignity and

1060
01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:31.139
respect and then continue to choose um an an

1061
01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:36.310
economic system that made that a joke, right? And

1062
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.590
it's very bad joke, a sad joke. Um It

1063
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.370
made it laughable in the worst possible way. And

1064
01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:45.969
that a society that continues down that road is

1065
01:04:45.979 --> 01:04:52.110
both morally responsible and in danger of instability. So

1066
01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.449
I do, I do think Hagel thinks those two

1067
01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:56.360
things are separate. So a better functioning society is

1068
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.459
going to be 11 with less inequality. But also

1069
01:04:59.469 --> 01:05:02.320
that totally aside, just as a moral issue. Um

1070
01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:04.600
YEAH, this is a classic failure

1071
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.780
and just to be totally clear because at a

1072
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:10.520
certain point there, you mentioned the fact that some

1073
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.919
of these ideas stem from the more general idea

1074
01:05:14.929 --> 01:05:21.139
that people, individual, people themselves have intrinsic value. I

1075
01:05:21.149 --> 01:05:24.370
mean, this is not just a matter of caring

1076
01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:29.500
about alleviating poverty with the long term success of

1077
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:33.620
a particular society in mind, but also caring actually

1078
01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:38.709
about the individuals themselves and the conditions they live

1079
01:05:38.719 --> 01:05:38.929
in.

1080
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:45.629
Yes and their emotional and effective attachment to their

1081
01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:48.489
value as workers. So when he starts to talk

1082
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.389
about solutions to this kind of poverty, he says,

1083
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:55.500
you know, you can certainly get government agencies involved

1084
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:59.320
in essentially welfare, but that's not going to fix

1085
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:03.159
the problem of self-respect. You have to give people

1086
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.659
the possibility of having dignity in their work if

1087
01:06:06.669 --> 01:06:09.439
work is going to be such a central part

1088
01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:13.729
of existence in a capitalist system. Um And so

1089
01:06:13.739 --> 01:06:15.729
yeah, ju I mean, just trying to eradicate it

1090
01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.689
through philanthropy is also not going to fix the

1091
01:06:18.699 --> 01:06:21.270
problem. It has to come at the level of

1092
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.510
actually valuing workers in their roles as workers.

1093
01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:29.290
Oh my God. So it was not just that

1094
01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.929
Marx was an alien but Hagel was also a

1095
01:06:32.939 --> 01:06:33.620
Marxist.

1096
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.530
Well, not everybody would agree with me. But, but,

1097
01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.100
yeah, I mean, I, I think that's all, that's

1098
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:39.969
all very clear to me. Um, THAT, that is

1099
01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:42.409
part of what Hagel was concerned about and, you

1100
01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:45.169
know, there are places in his philosophy where he

1101
01:06:45.179 --> 01:06:48.389
is also guilty of that kind of hypocrisy. So

1102
01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:50.149
it's not as if he had some sort of

1103
01:06:50.159 --> 01:06:52.810
moral genius that allowed him to see that in

1104
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.159
other parts of his life. But I, I think

1105
01:06:55.169 --> 01:06:58.020
that was one place where he really did see

1106
01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.540
the dangers that we are living with very presently

1107
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:00.979
now.

1108
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.610
Yeah. No, but I mean, I, I made, I

1109
01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.050
made that sort of a joke but, uh, uh,

1110
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.159
I, if, uh, he's, if you didn't mention his

1111
01:07:11.169 --> 01:07:15.629
name, just everything you said about poverty and capitalism

1112
01:07:15.639 --> 01:07:18.340
that we should structure society and all of that,

1113
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:23.260
I mean, if someone told me it was Marx

1114
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:23.399
to,

1115
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.479
I won't believe it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I

1116
01:07:27.489 --> 01:07:29.969
think that's true and that would be true until

1117
01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.649
we started talking about the state. Right. So Hagel

1118
01:07:32.659 --> 01:07:34.469
talks about all of this when he's talking about

1119
01:07:34.479 --> 01:07:36.949
civil society, which is the middle one of the.

1120
01:07:36.959 --> 01:07:38.879
So he talks about the family and civil society

1121
01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:41.110
and the state and its, when he starts to

1122
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:43.389
talk about the state that you would no longer

1123
01:07:43.399 --> 01:07:44.800
think we were talking about Marx.

1124
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:49.129
Great. So, uh we've already talked here a little

1125
01:07:49.139 --> 01:07:53.149
bit about uh comedy, but one of the things

1126
01:07:53.159 --> 01:07:56.800
you've also done work on, uh and again, focusing

1127
01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:02.469
on uh 19th century German philosophy is how seriously

1128
01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:05.669
some of these philosophers took laughter.

1129
01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:11.139
Right. Yeah. Or we might say like the laughable

1130
01:08:11.149 --> 01:08:14.389
because it, it's so hard to put all of

1131
01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:16.609
the things that we laugh at under uh and,

1132
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.180
and a lot of things that are laughable, we

1133
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:20.640
don't actually laugh at. So it's, it's a very

1134
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.189
thorny um topic. But, but yes, especially around the

1135
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.549
time when Hagel was writing. Um AGAIN, people like

1136
01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:33.620
Schlegel, um and some of the other more romantic

1137
01:08:33.629 --> 01:08:37.879
philosophers like Zolar um were taking this question of

1138
01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:40.020
what we laugh at and why or, or what

1139
01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:44.379
it means to differentiate between wit and irony and

1140
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:48.339
humor really seriously. And I think that, uh you

1141
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:50.430
know, Lessing was another one who took this very

1142
01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:55.299
seriously. Um Eta Hoffman, like the whole constellation of

1143
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:59.459
people who were philosophical, but also writing in literature.

1144
01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:02.680
Um And I think again, it comes back to

1145
01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:04.950
this question, like, what does it say about humans

1146
01:09:04.959 --> 01:09:08.310
that we laugh? And what does it say about

1147
01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.899
us that we find this whole range of things

1148
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.029
either funny or laughable? And what could we determine

1149
01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.640
about the essence of what it is to be

1150
01:09:15.649 --> 01:09:19.399
human by really trying to figure that out? And

1151
01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:23.680
if you're someone like Schlegel who thinks that Hegel

1152
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:28.790
is wrong to imagine that we can articulate truth

1153
01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:33.700
in philosophy, then you're going to be looking towards

1154
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:36.930
other forms that maybe as Schlegel would sort of

1155
01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:41.870
put it gesture at the truth while not articulating

1156
01:09:41.879 --> 01:09:45.540
it. Because articulating it is always going to introduce

1157
01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:49.359
new categories and therefore new division. So if the

1158
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.859
true is the whole, I think Schlegel would say

1159
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:57.620
to Hegel, um any conceptualization is just going to

1160
01:09:57.629 --> 01:10:00.600
show the division again. And if you want something

1161
01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:04.439
that retains the unity, it has to remain at

1162
01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:10.529
the level of affect or something like irony, which

1163
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.990
doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't define things,

1164
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.629
but sort of says that things are true through

1165
01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.220
saying they're opposite or says something that's witty in

1166
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:25.520
a way that you don't take literally, but you

1167
01:10:25.529 --> 01:10:28.490
see the truth behind it. Um So all of

1168
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.669
these are ways in which a whole range of

1169
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.620
people in the romantic generation decided that if we

1170
01:10:34.629 --> 01:10:37.390
could understand that and the way that functions in

1171
01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:40.720
the way humans interact with each other and lead

1172
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:43.379
our aesthetic lives, then we could probably understand something

1173
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:47.259
much deeper about humans themselves and about metaphysics quite

1174
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:49.939
honestly. Um So there's a lot of um I

1175
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:52.959
edited a volume of essays about uh humor in

1176
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.160
the 19th century. And as I say in the

1177
01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:58.540
introduction, usually when I tell people that they laugh

1178
01:10:58.549 --> 01:11:01.140
because um one of the things we laugh at

1179
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:05.419
is incongruity and it feels so incongruous to talk

1180
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:09.350
about humor in this generation of very serious philosophers,

1181
01:11:09.359 --> 01:11:11.350
but it is something they took really seriously.

1182
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.569
And I mean, trying to understand something about our

1183
01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:19.870
human nature through laughter. I mean, there are many

1184
01:11:19.879 --> 01:11:22.399
different ways we can try to understand it. Right.

1185
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:26.790
And I mean, even philosophers themselves, many different philosophers

1186
01:11:26.799 --> 01:11:31.779
across history uh have had different theories about why

1187
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.520
people laugh at something. And, uh, I, I mean,

1188
01:11:35.529 --> 01:11:37.549
perhaps all of them are true. I don't know

1189
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.290
because some, we laugh at different things in different

1190
01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:46.180
contexts for different reasons. I mean, sometimes we might

1191
01:11:46.259 --> 01:11:49.549
laugh at something because it's funny and why it's

1192
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.129
funny is an entire question by itself. But uh

1193
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:59.009
sometimes perhaps people laugh at someone to mock them.

1194
01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.060
Not exactly because it's funny, but just to mock

1195
01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:06.720
them or to feel superior to other people, perhaps

1196
01:12:06.729 --> 01:12:10.879
something, someone does something wrong. Uh And they are,

1197
01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:13.569
I mean, competing with them and then the other

1198
01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.589
person laughs just because, oh, you made the mistake.

1199
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.419
So I'm in a, in a better situation than

1200
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:21.919
you are or something like that. So, I mean,

1201
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:27.000
the, uh just thinking about laughter itself and the

1202
01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:33.479
many different contexts and reasons why people laugh is,

1203
01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:37.609
uh, I mean, it's, it's a very wide uh

1204
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.680
field of inquiry, I guess.

1205
01:12:41.049 --> 01:12:43.169
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

1206
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:49.189
OK. So, um let's get now into uh how

1207
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.790
you got interested in abolitionism in America in the

1208
01:12:54.799 --> 01:12:58.799
19th century. So, tell us first about that. What

1209
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:01.950
got you interested in that and then we'll get

1210
01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:05.180
into the work of Lydia Maria Child.

1211
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:12.069
Yeah, this was, um, a very direct response on

1212
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.069
my part to the 2016 election in the United

1213
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.830
States. So when, when Donald Trump was elected, um

1214
01:13:17.839 --> 01:13:20.310
it became very clear to many of us that

1215
01:13:20.319 --> 01:13:22.720
we were in a kind of moral and political

1216
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:27.180
emergency. Uh So the real resurgence of a kind

1217
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:30.279
of far right, political stance and all of the

1218
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:35.330
other things that Trump represented, including his um just

1219
01:13:35.339 --> 01:13:40.850
open derision of and abuse of women. And I

1220
01:13:40.859 --> 01:13:44.970
think as a Hagel scholar, I've always had to

1221
01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:48.669
grapple a little bit with what, how I felt

1222
01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.740
when I would read Hagel scholarship from the 19

1223
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:56.689
thirties. And I would always have in the back

1224
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.899
of my mind, what did this person think they

1225
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:03.759
were doing? Um WAS what they were doing more

1226
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:06.959
important than anything they could have been doing to

1227
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:10.319
fight the rise of fascism in Germany. Um And

1228
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:13.459
I don't pretend I don't mean to be judgmental.

1229
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:15.459
I'm sure people have all kinds of reasons, et

1230
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:18.589
cetera, but I just had a very clear sense

1231
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.149
very quickly that I needed my professional life and

1232
01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.100
my scholarship to reflect the time that I was

1233
01:14:25.109 --> 01:14:29.220
living in. And I had a, I wanted to

1234
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:31.890
know who in my own country and in my

1235
01:14:31.899 --> 01:14:35.160
own history. Um I could turn to as an

1236
01:14:35.169 --> 01:14:39.129
example of someone who had faced a moral emergency

1237
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.859
in their country. Head on. And I just decided

1238
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:44.520
I wanted to turn to women. I'd spent 20

1239
01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:48.069
years of my career really exclusively focusing on men.

1240
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.609
And so I, I asked myself to fight something

1241
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:56.970
as entrenched as enslavement was in the United States

1242
01:14:57.319 --> 01:15:00.669
in the 19th century. I just thought you'd have

1243
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.049
to be thinking philosophically, you'd have to be asking

1244
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:09.089
big questions like, what is equality, what is justice?

1245
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.669
What does it mean to be a human? What

1246
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.569
is moral obligation? Um So I went to an

1247
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.549
archive associated with Harvard and that, that is a,

1248
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.299
a library and an archive specifically about women and

1249
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.919
asked if they knew of any women with a

1250
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:30.819
kind of philosophical uh trajectory who had been involved

1251
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:34.299
in abolitionism and they didn't. But they gave me

1252
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:37.700
a box of letters that included a letter by

1253
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:40.859
this woman who I'd never heard of, but um

1254
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.620
was immediately just transfixed by her moral vision, her

1255
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:51.040
ability to argue philosophically um and her ability to

1256
01:15:51.049 --> 01:15:56.100
dedicate her life to ending entrenched evil in her

1257
01:15:56.109 --> 01:16:00.459
country. So I decided to pivot towards doing something

1258
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:02.689
about her. And at first I, I did write

1259
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.850
a couple of more academic articles about her. She

1260
01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:09.240
was definitely a philosophical thinker. She also talked about

1261
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:12.629
philosophy. She read philosophy, she was very influenced by

1262
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:17.399
German philosophy. Um She regularly cites Schiller and Goethe

1263
01:16:17.799 --> 01:16:21.339
and Harrier and John Paul. She mentions Kant, she

1264
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:24.680
mentions Hegel. German philosophy was very popular in the

1265
01:16:24.689 --> 01:16:27.700
United States. Um, IN the 18 thirties and forties

1266
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.959
when she started writing. So I had a lot

1267
01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:36.009
of pretty instant connections to her philosophical thinking. But

1268
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.490
what really again got my attention was she wrote

1269
01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.169
a book in 18 33 and that's almost three

1270
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.649
decades before the American Civil War started. So in

1271
01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.509
18 33 he wrote a book called An Appeal

1272
01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.859
in Favor of that class of Americans called Africans.

1273
01:16:54.439 --> 01:16:58.629
And this, this is just a fire hose of

1274
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.009
arguments denouncing all of the bad arguments that Americans

1275
01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:08.970
had been using to justify slavery. And I was

1276
01:17:08.979 --> 01:17:12.069
so impressed by how she, I think her general

1277
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.529
philosophical commitment was to thinking that humans are basically

1278
01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:20.660
good, but they're susceptible to bad arguments that appeal

1279
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:24.479
to their selfishness, their self interest, their vanity. And

1280
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:28.020
if you can just clear away those arguments, you

1281
01:17:28.029 --> 01:17:31.720
can really get them to reform. I'm not sure

1282
01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:34.080
she was right about that. I don't even think

1283
01:17:34.089 --> 01:17:36.100
she thought she was right about that by the

1284
01:17:36.109 --> 01:17:39.060
end of her life. Um But I became really

1285
01:17:39.069 --> 01:17:43.600
fascinated both by her as a philosophical thinker, but

1286
01:17:43.609 --> 01:17:47.620
also as a woman whose life intersects in all

1287
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:50.640
of the major moments leading up to and through

1288
01:17:50.649 --> 01:17:55.129
the American Civil War. Um She did everything from

1289
01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:00.089
put her body between abolitionist speakers and anti abolitionist

1290
01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:05.564
mobs. She wrote fiction and also argumentative essays. She

1291
01:18:05.575 --> 01:18:10.084
wrote biographies, she wrote histories. Um She volunteered herself

1292
01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:14.634
raising money for and sewing for both union soldiers

1293
01:18:14.645 --> 01:18:19.524
and, um, enslaved peoples. So she, um, she was,

1294
01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.629
she is, to me a real example of someone

1295
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.729
who took her role as an American citizen seriously

1296
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.779
and deployed everything she could think of, uh, to

1297
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:34.450
address what she saw as the great moral crisis

1298
01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:36.540
in her country. So I wrote a biography of

1299
01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:39.299
her. Um, AGAIN, I, I thought I would just

1300
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:42.410
sort of write academic articles about her, but the

1301
01:18:42.419 --> 01:18:45.379
story is so compelling that I ended up writing

1302
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:47.620
the whole thing and that came out um about

1303
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:48.339
six months ago.

1304
01:18:49.399 --> 01:18:53.709
Great. Uh And II, I mean, uh we also

1305
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.100
have to keep in mind that the 19th century

1306
01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:02.790
was not to, to put it mildly very women

1307
01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:07.609
friendly and also for the most part, not very

1308
01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:12.129
friendly to any person who was not of European

1309
01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:18.930
descent, basically in, in terms of the mainstream philosophers,

1310
01:19:18.939 --> 01:19:21.950
thinkers, scientists and so on. Uh I mean, of

1311
01:19:21.959 --> 01:19:24.750
course, we have to keep also in mind the

1312
01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:28.799
cultural context back then. And I, I'm also not

1313
01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:31.589
one of those people who, of course, I say

1314
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.290
that that they were wrong in terms of their

1315
01:19:34.299 --> 01:19:37.819
sexism and racism. But I don't think that if

1316
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:42.080
I lived back then I wouldn't have been racist

1317
01:19:42.089 --> 01:19:46.450
and sexist myself, of course, very likely I would

1318
01:19:46.459 --> 01:19:49.290
have been one as well and most of us,

1319
01:19:49.299 --> 01:19:51.669
I guess so. Uh But I mean, we have

1320
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.640
to keep that, keep that in mind but also

1321
01:19:55.810 --> 01:20:01.129
the struggle that women and, uh, but, uh African

1322
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:06.689
Americans and other minorities went through and particularly since

1323
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.649
we are approaching things here from a philosophical perspective

1324
01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.819
and I am talking with U as an academic,

1325
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.919
I mean, it's historically, it's a fact and even

1326
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:25.709
con temporarily that, uh, women and, uh, other minorities,

1327
01:20:25.819 --> 01:20:29.839
uh, I mean, their work has very much been

1328
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:35.660
neglected, sometimes suppressed and, uh, stuff like that. Right.

1329
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:39.279
So, it's, it's not been easy at all for

1330
01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:46.890
people who are not European white males and European

1331
01:20:46.899 --> 01:20:50.569
white males, particularly from the upper classes to have

1332
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.069
their voices heard.

1333
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:55.589
Yeah. Yeah. And, and there's really wonderful work being

1334
01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.000
done on that. So, um Kristen Yah and Dal

1335
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.470
and Nassar just last year published a whole anthology

1336
01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:05.740
of work by women philosophers in Germany in the

1337
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:09.140
19th century. And Alison Stone and I are working

1338
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:12.629
on a handbook about British and American women philosophers

1339
01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.149
in the 19th century. There were many more of

1340
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.810
them than we think there were. And they were

1341
01:21:18.819 --> 01:21:22.259
often much better known than we think they were.

1342
01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:25.580
So, what we're talking about is a combination of,

1343
01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.700
of course, women didn't have the same opportunities as

1344
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:30.819
men as far as education goes. But they, but

1345
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:34.939
even those who manage to philosophize despite that were

1346
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:40.410
pretty actively repressed and forgotten later, like not in

1347
01:21:40.419 --> 01:21:42.990
their lifetimes but later. So, so there's a lot

1348
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.779
of really interesting work on that. Um THAT I

1349
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:48.549
I feel very passionate about. And I, I also

1350
01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.189
think to your other point, it's really important for

1351
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.740
us to acknowledge in as much detail as we

1352
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:59.459
can the damage that people like Hagel did on

1353
01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:02.040
these topics. So I think even myself as a

1354
01:22:02.049 --> 01:22:04.359
woman, I used to just sort of think, well,

1355
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:06.819
of course, he thought women were like plants like

1356
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:10.279
everybody did, but that's not true. There were lots

1357
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:12.959
of people including women who didn't think that, but

1358
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:16.529
there were, he did have options available to him

1359
01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.899
and even more so on race. So there's a,

1360
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:23.609
there's really important work by Daniel James and Franz

1361
01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:28.359
Kopek and um and, and others on what Hagel

1362
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:32.000
probably did know about other ways of thinking about

1363
01:22:32.009 --> 01:22:35.799
non European peoples which he deliberately chose to ignore

1364
01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:40.270
or suppress. And there's even terrible stories about Hagel.

1365
01:22:40.439 --> 01:22:44.069
Hagel's like philosophy of history being used as a

1366
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.970
justification in the United States for perpetuating slavery. And,

1367
01:22:49.979 --> 01:22:52.120
you know, I was talking earlier about Hagel's ability

1368
01:22:52.129 --> 01:22:56.500
to pinpoint hypocrisies um between in a culture that

1369
01:22:56.509 --> 01:22:58.899
said on the one hand, all humans are worthy

1370
01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:00.919
of dignity and respect. And on the other hand,

1371
01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:06.479
subjecting them to capitalism's woes. Obviously, Hagel himself is

1372
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:11.520
horrendously guilty of doing that pretty much with anyone

1373
01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:13.600
who wasn't, as you said, an upper class white

1374
01:23:13.609 --> 01:23:18.629
European male. Um And I have become much less

1375
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.189
willing just to say, wow, OK, that's like a

1376
01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.700
part of his philosophy, we can ignore um and

1377
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:27.100
much more determined to take that head on and,

1378
01:23:27.109 --> 01:23:30.330
and as you say, too importantly, augmented with a

1379
01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:35.640
kind of humility that reminds myself as well, that

1380
01:23:35.649 --> 01:23:38.120
I'm probably on the wrong side of history on

1381
01:23:38.129 --> 01:23:41.259
other things. And that, um if I were living

1382
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:43.479
at Hegel's time, I probably would have had many

1383
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:47.020
opinions that were not very enlightened either. So, to

1384
01:23:47.029 --> 01:23:49.470
me, that's part of the, the general project of

1385
01:23:49.479 --> 01:23:52.479
thinking about the 19th century is elevating voices like

1386
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:57.339
childs that are um so philosophical and so resonant

1387
01:23:57.350 --> 01:24:00.370
and using the same kinds of ideas, including ideas

1388
01:24:00.379 --> 01:24:04.430
about art that Hagel was interested in, but really

1389
01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.390
in the service of good and trying to be

1390
01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:10.120
much more mindful and critical of ways in which

1391
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:14.160
Hegel's philosophy is beautiful and compelling as it can

1392
01:24:14.169 --> 01:24:15.850
be um was used for evil.

1393
01:24:16.799 --> 01:24:20.649
Yeah. Uh I mean, this is another entire discussion

1394
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.120
that I think is very interesting that people can

1395
01:24:23.129 --> 01:24:25.609
have. I mean, uh and the same applies to

1396
01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:29.419
artists. I mean, sometimes people discuss if what we

1397
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:33.620
should do with the work of immoral artists, if

1398
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:37.125
we should ban it, if not, if we, if

1399
01:24:37.134 --> 01:24:40.734
we don't ban it, uh we should analyze it.

1400
01:24:40.745 --> 01:24:43.015
Uh We should think of it if we should

1401
01:24:43.024 --> 01:24:47.174
appreciate it or not and if we should criticize

1402
01:24:47.185 --> 01:24:50.325
it, uh I mean, there's uh an immensity of

1403
01:24:50.334 --> 01:24:53.560
questions out there that are very interesting about that.

1404
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:56.950
But, but uh uh I mean, of course, Uh

1405
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:59.600
I'm not myself and I don't think you are

1406
01:24:59.609 --> 01:25:03.049
some of those people. I think that perhaps we

1407
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.470
should be because someone in the 19th century or

1408
01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:11.075
the 18th century had some appalling views on women

1409
01:25:11.084 --> 01:25:14.444
and uh black people and other minorities that we

1410
01:25:14.455 --> 01:25:20.265
should just, uh, I completely ignore or think that

1411
01:25:20.274 --> 01:25:23.555
the rest of their work is, doesn't have any

1412
01:25:23.895 --> 01:25:29.370
intellectual valid validity at all. But, uh yeah, it's

1413
01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:35.209
very much a well established fact that all of

1414
01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:40.080
the people we talked about in German philosophy in

1415
01:25:40.089 --> 01:25:44.259
the 19th century and Kent was mostly from the

1416
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:48.149
18th century and, and others like them. Uh I,

1417
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.330
I mean, I, I it, it's interesting that even

1418
01:25:51.339 --> 01:25:55.640
Kent was talking about universal values but apparently they

1419
01:25:55.649 --> 01:26:03.350
didn't apply to uh non European people uh curiously

1420
01:26:03.359 --> 01:26:06.029
enough. But, but I, I mean, the same thing

1421
01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.390
I guess happened in other sorts of instances, like,

1422
01:26:09.399 --> 01:26:14.399
for example, you have the French revolution and supposedly

1423
01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:18.569
everyone should get a vote, everyone should get the

1424
01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:23.709
same. But it was just very gradually that the

1425
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:29.979
population in France, uh the adult population got to

1426
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:32.720
AAA right to vote. I mean, first it was

1427
01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:37.549
just uh one slice of the male population and

1428
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.430
then, and the same in happened in America, I

1429
01:26:40.439 --> 01:26:43.319
think, I think that initially it was just the,

1430
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:48.600
the people who, who owned land, I guess whether

1431
01:26:48.609 --> 01:26:50.950
the right to vote and then it was, yeah,

1432
01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:51.229
all

1433
01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.129
of that was in flux. For a very long

1434
01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.430
time here. That's true. And, and the other thing

1435
01:26:55.439 --> 01:26:56.890
to bring up, I think in the context of

1436
01:26:56.899 --> 01:27:00.129
the French revolution is the Haitian revolution. And the

1437
01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.149
fact that France absolutely did not want any of

1438
01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.390
their revolutionary principles to apply to a part of

1439
01:27:06.399 --> 01:27:09.970
the world that was primarily inhabited by Black people.

1440
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:13.330
Um So that, that's another classic case of um

1441
01:27:13.339 --> 01:27:15.540
of the kind of hypocrisy that I think you're

1442
01:27:15.549 --> 01:27:19.379
right. To me, it just feels increasingly important to

1443
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:23.939
acknowledge those problems always and upfront. And in every

1444
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:27.879
part of our discussion of these earlier thinkers, um

1445
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:30.149
and never to treat it as something we can

1446
01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.879
just sort of mention on the side and then

1447
01:27:31.890 --> 01:27:35.490
move on from. Um But I don't think that

1448
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.629
ignoring these people is good either because it's important

1449
01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.649
for us to remember that even people who were

1450
01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:45.930
intelligent and progressive in other ways um could make

1451
01:27:45.939 --> 01:27:47.330
really horrendous mistakes.

1452
01:27:48.169 --> 01:27:50.410
And I, and I guess that I it's not

1453
01:27:50.419 --> 01:27:54.319
only important from a sort of ethical standpoint but

1454
01:27:54.330 --> 01:28:00.399
also intellectually speaking, I guess it's enriching uh to

1455
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:06.240
uh have a better understanding of how our socio

1456
01:28:06.299 --> 01:28:11.879
cultural context can influence and have an impact on

1457
01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:15.279
our intellectual work, I guess.

1458
01:28:15.330 --> 01:28:18.240
Absolutely. Yeah, we, we need to understand why we

1459
01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:22.410
think what we think and understanding thinkers that came

1460
01:28:22.419 --> 01:28:25.169
before us is an indispensable part of that for

1461
01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:25.560
sure.

1462
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:29.669
A a and also keeping in keeping in mind

1463
01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.120
that again, people are not disembodied beings and we

1464
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:37.819
live and we not only have a body but

1465
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:41.180
we also live in a particular society in a

1466
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:45.589
particular period of time, in a particular culture, we

1467
01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.000
have a ton of different in influences and we

1468
01:28:49.009 --> 01:28:53.450
are also products of all of that even intellectually.

1469
01:28:53.459 --> 01:28:57.740
It's not that we have some sort of reasoning

1470
01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:03.399
faculty that, that is impermeable to all of that

1471
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:06.209
and that allow us to get some sort of

1472
01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.959
glimpse into objective reality as it is.

1473
01:29:10.859 --> 01:29:13.350
Yeah. And I, I'll also just say briefly, that's

1474
01:29:13.359 --> 01:29:15.819
one of the things that really fascinates me about

1475
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:21.979
child is that she was able in many ways

1476
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:26.629
to transcend and to see beyond what was absolutely

1477
01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.790
the norm around her. And I'm really fascinated by

1478
01:29:29.799 --> 01:29:32.850
that. Um And I, you know, most of your

1479
01:29:32.859 --> 01:29:35.299
viewers will know that. Um So she grew up

1480
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:38.129
in Boston, which is in the north and most

1481
01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:44.200
northerners now assume that all northerners then were against

1482
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:48.419
slavery. And that's absolutely not true. Absolutely not true.

1483
01:29:48.669 --> 01:29:53.479
Many northerners actively resisted the end of slavery in

1484
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:56.830
the South. So she was surrounded by politicians and

1485
01:29:56.839 --> 01:30:01.370
educators and journalists and religious leaders who actively preached

1486
01:30:01.379 --> 01:30:04.310
that this was an acceptable way for society to

1487
01:30:04.319 --> 01:30:07.709
be organized. And somehow she saw beyond it. And

1488
01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.169
she, you know, she wasn't alone in that. And

1489
01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.209
I'll also say part of how she knew this

1490
01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.839
is she actually talked to black people, right? So

1491
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:17.240
she actually listened to the people who were themselves

1492
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:20.319
affected. And once was able to see it from

1493
01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:22.580
their point of view, realized that what she was

1494
01:30:22.589 --> 01:30:26.609
hearing from the leaders in her society was, was

1495
01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.169
wrong. So again, I don't mean to suggest that

1496
01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.779
she had some sort of, as you say, disembodied

1497
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:35.029
um experience, but she was willing to listen in

1498
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.049
a way that I take as an inspiration to

1499
01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.560
those of us who sometimes it's a kind of

1500
01:30:40.569 --> 01:30:43.529
occupational hazard for philosophers. We like to look at

1501
01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.359
things from very high up. And often I think

1502
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:49.020
it takes more of a listening on the ground

1503
01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.399
to um get real ethical insight into what needs

1504
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.160
to happen next.

1505
01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.709
By the way, at least back in her time,

1506
01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:02.279
how influential was her, I mean, in the philosophical

1507
01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:07.109
world and more specifically in the abolitionist movement in

1508
01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:07.859
the US,

1509
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:11.270
she was very influential. She, she was one of

1510
01:31:11.279 --> 01:31:15.459
the most famous abolitionists um of the 19th century.

1511
01:31:15.959 --> 01:31:18.080
And, and part of what's so interesting about her

1512
01:31:18.089 --> 01:31:20.660
is that she was famous before. She became an

1513
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:25.370
abolitionist because she um almost unheard of in the

1514
01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:30.379
American 19th century by the age of 22 which

1515
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:32.370
would have been, you know, in the mid 18

1516
01:31:32.379 --> 01:31:35.700
twenties, was a very well known novelist and a

1517
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:39.290
self sufficient female author. And she'd written a couple

1518
01:31:39.299 --> 01:31:42.950
novels and a couple of self-help books, um like

1519
01:31:42.959 --> 01:31:47.410
cooking books or books about parenting or housekeeping um

1520
01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.680
that had made her really beloved and trusted along

1521
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:52.930
among a great swath. I mean, she was the

1522
01:31:52.939 --> 01:31:57.109
19th century equivalent of a household name. Um And

1523
01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:00.770
when she became an abolitionist, that was so upsetting

1524
01:32:00.779 --> 01:32:02.770
to her readers because it really meant that she

1525
01:32:02.779 --> 01:32:05.890
was a radical because to be, to be an

1526
01:32:05.899 --> 01:32:08.439
abolitionist in the 18 twenties and thirties in the

1527
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:12.379
United States was to argue for the immediate end

1528
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:17.290
of slavery without compensation to enslavers and most Americans

1529
01:32:17.299 --> 01:32:19.009
in the North and the South thought that that

1530
01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:23.859
was just unthinkably radical. Um But she, that's what

1531
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:26.709
she was convinced. And, you know, by the time

1532
01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.910
she was about 30 she continued to be one

1533
01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:33.819
of the best published and most um public facing

1534
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:36.220
intellectuals of the 19th century. And certainly in the

1535
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:39.040
abolitionist movement as far as her involvement in the

1536
01:32:39.049 --> 01:32:42.580
philosophical community, it's interesting, I mean, there wasn't so

1537
01:32:42.589 --> 01:32:48.399
much like philosophical tradition in the United States except

1538
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:50.720
really for the one that was getting going again

1539
01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:55.240
in Boston around Ralph Waldo Emerson. And they did

1540
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:58.919
know each other. They were almost exact contemporaries and

1541
01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:01.919
she was admiring and would go to his lectures.

1542
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:06.149
Um But also was always concerned that he was

1543
01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.410
allowing the abstraction of his thought to distract him

1544
01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:12.979
from what she thought he should be doing, which

1545
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:16.359
was fighting slavery. So she'd sometimes say he has

1546
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:19.689
a platform big enough and a mind capacious enough

1547
01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.330
really to make arguments against slavery and he's not

1548
01:33:23.549 --> 01:33:26.879
doing it. Um Emerson did come around to doing

1549
01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:30.839
that but only in 18 59 when John Brown's

1550
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:35.629
failed insurrection in Virginia uh convinced him that slavery

1551
01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.310
needed to be um opposed. So she, she certainly

1552
01:33:39.319 --> 01:33:41.790
knew all of the philosophers in the Boston area

1553
01:33:41.799 --> 01:33:44.560
of her time and socialized with them, communicated with

1554
01:33:44.569 --> 01:33:47.609
them, but I think she feared that they had

1555
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:51.020
disengaged themselves from the moral topics of their day.

1556
01:33:51.029 --> 01:33:51.700
Too much.

1557
01:33:53.319 --> 01:33:56.399
OK. So uh I, I'm also getting mindful of

1558
01:33:56.410 --> 01:33:58.919
your time now. So let me ask you, let

1559
01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:02.200
me ask you one last question. Uh And let

1560
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:05.600
me see if, if I can phrase this correctly.

1561
01:34:05.609 --> 01:34:09.939
So, uh and be clear about it. Uh So,

1562
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:14.899
uh I mean, there are some parts of philosophy

1563
01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.759
that are politically motivated, like for example, abolitionism is

1564
01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:24.069
a very clear example of that. And there are

1565
01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.390
people that tend to be a little bit dismissive

1566
01:34:28.399 --> 01:34:34.759
of philosophy that is done while politically motivated. And

1567
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:39.779
usually those people from come from political positions that

1568
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:44.129
are opposite to the, to the ones that they

1569
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.390
say are not valid philosophy, of course. So the

1570
01:34:48.399 --> 01:34:51.490
question I wanted to ask you then is how

1571
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:55.410
do you look at the place of a movement

1572
01:34:55.419 --> 01:35:02.669
like abolitionism uh in the broader historical context of

1573
01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.870
philosophy? And uh uh I mean, when it comes

1574
01:35:06.879 --> 01:35:12.939
to how people look again at politically motivated philosophy,

1575
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:17.910
I mean, to what extent do you think we

1576
01:35:17.919 --> 01:35:21.390
should take it seriously? And, I mean, what do

1577
01:35:21.399 --> 01:35:26.169
you think basically about those people's position, the positions

1578
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.109
that, oh, I, I mean, philosophy should be about,

1579
01:35:31.509 --> 01:35:35.509
I don't know people in academia. I, I mean,

1580
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.490
it's, uh, transmitting knowledge to students shouldn't be about,

1581
01:35:41.509 --> 01:35:46.009
uh, turning them into activists or something like that.

1582
01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.910
So, uh, I, I mean, I, I hope I'm

1583
01:35:48.919 --> 01:35:51.970
being clear in terms of the question I'm asking

1584
01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:54.080
here. But what are your thoughts on it?

1585
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:56.649
Yeah, thank you. It's such a, it's such an

1586
01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.529
important question to me uh now, so I appreciate

1587
01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:04.229
the chance to think about it. Um I guess

1588
01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:07.779
a couple of things, first of all, philosophy has

1589
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:12.069
not always been removed from reality. And I think

1590
01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.589
like the story of the 19th century into the

1591
01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:22.790
20th century uh is much more about philosophy deciding

1592
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:28.390
to extract itself from practice. And there are historical

1593
01:36:28.399 --> 01:36:32.339
reasons for that, but I think we're wrong if

1594
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:34.529
we assume and I this isn't what you were

1595
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.410
saying either. But I think some of the people

1596
01:36:36.419 --> 01:36:39.549
you're thinking about would say this, that, that real

1597
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.169
philosophy shouldn't dirty its hands or shouldn't kind of

1598
01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.229
get involved in the world because then it's not

1599
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.020
as pure, that's, that's a choice that philosophy has

1600
01:36:51.029 --> 01:36:55.919
made relatively recently as a discipline and it has

1601
01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:59.779
to do with the professionalization of philosophy um in

1602
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:02.430
the 19th century, in the United States. Well, the

1603
01:37:02.439 --> 01:37:04.490
three cases I know most about are the US,

1604
01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.160
the UK and Germany, you, you couldn't get a

1605
01:37:08.169 --> 01:37:11.419
degree in philosophy no matter who you were in

1606
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:14.399
for a long time. Right. Phd. S weren't invented

1607
01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:17.080
that long ago and even after they were invented,

1608
01:37:17.089 --> 01:37:21.979
they weren't necessary to philosophizing philosophical journals did not

1609
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:25.529
use to require that you came from. Um, YOU

1610
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.689
had a phd in philosophy to publish. So, so

1611
01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.850
the, the professionalization of philosophy has meant that what

1612
01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:34.870
it means to do philosophy has gotten narrower and

1613
01:37:34.879 --> 01:37:38.709
narrower and narrower, more elitist, more professionalized. But there's

1614
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:42.660
a very long history of philosophy being born out

1615
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:47.470
of grappling with the real world as it were.

1616
01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:50.129
Um And I don't think there's been a social

1617
01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.569
movement in history that hasn't required people to think

1618
01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:56.910
philosophically. Um I mean, Angela Davis is a great

1619
01:37:56.919 --> 01:38:00.459
example of someone who uh was doing a phd

1620
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:03.890
in philosophy before she became an activist and brought

1621
01:38:03.899 --> 01:38:07.490
her um studies in Spinoza and Kant and Hegel

1622
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.049
to her struggle for racial justice in the United

1623
01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.430
States. But I think pretty much anywhere you look,

1624
01:38:13.439 --> 01:38:17.129
you would find people who are fighting for justice

1625
01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.660
thinking philosophically. And I've been very happy to see

1626
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:22.569
people emphasizing that more. So people are writing about

1627
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.419
Martin Luther King as a philosopher for instance. Um

1628
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:28.890
And yeah, I was going to say that perhaps

1629
01:38:28.899 --> 01:38:32.509
another excellent example would be the civil rights movement

1630
01:38:32.549 --> 01:38:35.240
in the 19 sixties and seventies. Yeah,

1631
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:39.879
exactly. So, so I think a, a more or

1632
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:41.930
an alternate model and I think in some ways,

1633
01:38:41.939 --> 01:38:45.270
a truer model to philosophy's history is that when

1634
01:38:45.279 --> 01:38:49.140
people are confronted with injustices, they have to ask

1635
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:52.020
those bigger questions. And I think what philosophy can

1636
01:38:52.029 --> 01:38:54.000
do to empower us is to give us some

1637
01:38:54.009 --> 01:38:57.359
clarity about those questions. So, you know, really what

1638
01:38:57.370 --> 01:38:59.629
is justice? Um YOU know, we can go back

1639
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.779
to the Republic to find people trying to figure

1640
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:05.500
that out. And so when I teach philosophy, I

1641
01:39:05.509 --> 01:39:08.040
don't at all think of myself as trying to

1642
01:39:08.049 --> 01:39:11.279
turn my students into activists. But I do think

1643
01:39:11.290 --> 01:39:13.470
that I want them to see that philosophy can

1644
01:39:13.479 --> 01:39:18.640
be a really powerful and even essential tool for

1645
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:22.939
understanding the terms of our debates and the kinds

1646
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:25.200
of things we want to fight for and then

1647
01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:29.459
giving us the clarity of thought that can motivate

1648
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.580
action. So when, when I think about the way

1649
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:36.740
movements work, sometimes what happens is people just aren't

1650
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:40.729
particularly clear what they're fighting for and why and

1651
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.930
what that means is that whenever there's infighting or

1652
01:39:42.939 --> 01:39:45.819
tension or unclear, like you can just lose focus

1653
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:48.259
and get, you know, distracted by the details. But

1654
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:51.020
the better you are at saying no, I thought

1655
01:39:51.029 --> 01:39:53.459
this through philosophically, even if you don't phrase it

1656
01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:56.180
that way. This is what is important, this is

1657
01:39:56.189 --> 01:40:00.399
what back to Hagel really creating a society in

1658
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:03.649
which people can truly be free and not just

1659
01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.330
abstractly free. This is what it would look like

1660
01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:10.609
that that is empowering and motivating in a way

1661
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.520
that can help us stave off the kind of

1662
01:40:12.529 --> 01:40:17.890
burnout or fatalism that is all too often the

1663
01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:22.419
death of movements for justice. So I would prefer

1664
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:24.919
to think philosophy is as something that is born

1665
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.640
out of humans, just trying to figure our way

1666
01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:31.500
out in the world. And the more those of

1667
01:40:31.509 --> 01:40:35.759
us who are inclined to think philosophically can articulate

1668
01:40:35.770 --> 01:40:37.589
those thoughts and help people think them through. I

1669
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.270
think the better chance philosophy has of actually fulfilling

1670
01:40:41.279 --> 01:40:42.319
a good purpose in the world.

1671
01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.939
Yeah, a and perhaps, I mean, people who might

1672
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:53.870
be worried uh about keeping some of the philosophical

1673
01:40:53.879 --> 01:40:57.779
traditions of the West, perhaps they should also keep

1674
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:03.060
in mind that if Plato is the father of

1675
01:41:03.069 --> 01:41:07.569
Western philosophy, then he wrote a book titled The

1676
01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:12.390
Republic, which which I I it would be very

1677
01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:18.299
hard to argue that it's not politically motivated because

1678
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:22.060
it's literally a book about how to, to, to

1679
01:41:22.069 --> 01:41:26.899
structure politically a society from top to bottom. So,

1680
01:41:27.479 --> 01:41:27.649
yeah,

1681
01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:29.859
very good. Yeah, absolutely. And the more I think

1682
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:34.379
we recognize that philosophy has been done in many

1683
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:39.279
different ways. So like the academic article really new,

1684
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:42.310
I mean, we think about like Plato writing and

1685
01:41:42.319 --> 01:41:45.589
dialogues and Aristotle giving lectures and you know, k

1686
01:41:45.729 --> 01:41:49.129
writing something more that we recognize as philosophy, but

1687
01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:54.069
people writing philosophically through literature, Nietzsche through aphorisms, like

1688
01:41:54.339 --> 01:41:57.520
many of our most important philosophers have been really

1689
01:41:57.529 --> 01:42:02.169
disruptive of what people thought philosophy was. And so

1690
01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:05.109
I, I do not feel like my time is

1691
01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.859
well spent fighting for a version of philosophy that

1692
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:13.149
I think is pretty historically contingent, sometimes harmful and

1693
01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.509
not where the real energy of philosophy should be

1694
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:22.770
great. So, uh let's wrap up the interview here

1695
01:42:22.779 --> 01:42:26.009
then uh just before we go and by the

1696
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.390
way, I'm also leaving a link in the description

1697
01:42:28.399 --> 01:42:32.240
box to your book Lydia on Lydia Maria Child.

1698
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:35.029
Uh AND apart from the book, would you like

1699
01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.350
