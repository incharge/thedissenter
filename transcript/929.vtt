00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.659
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.670
joined by Doctor Emily Qureshi Hurst. She's a Stinar

4
00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.850
lecturer in Philosophy at Oriel College and a junior

5
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.540
research fellowship at Pen Brook College, University of Oxford.

6
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.420
And today we're talking about her book, God Salvation

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.719
and The Problem of Spacetime. So, Doctor Qureshi Hurst,

8
00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.959
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:31.770
Thank you so much for inviting me. I'm really

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.520
looking forward to having a conversation with you about

11
00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.790
this.

12
00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.080
So I, I mean, this is a very interesting

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.509
book and actually, to be honest, it's not that

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.819
common for me to get into topics in theology

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.159
on the show. So I, I mean, just to

16
00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:51.319
perhaps introduce the audience to the main questions we

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.439
are exploring here today. First of all, what is

18
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.000
the metaphysics of time and what kinds of questions

19
00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.919
does it tackle?

20
00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.580
So that's a really great question to start with

21
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.989
because in a sense, all of the conversations we're

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.589
gonna be having about philosophy, about theology and about

23
00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.510
spacetime are structured in accordance with some of the

24
00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.769
conceptual categories that we get from the metaphysics of

25
00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.790
time. So metaphysics very broadly is the study of

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.790
ultimate reality. So maybe the study of being the

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.519
study of change identity, that sort of thing. Uh

28
00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:27.889
And the metaphysics of time then asks what time

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.000
is uh does time exist? Does it flow? Do

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330
all moments of time exist eternally? Or is the

31
00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:40.180
future unreal the present real and the past gone

32
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.319
forever? So it's those kind of questions that are

33
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.269
asked, does time pass? Does time exist? What are

34
00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.169
moments of time? Um And how best should we

35
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.760
try and come towards an answer to these questions

36
00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:53.239
as well?

37
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.120
So in the book, uh and since you come

38
00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.879
at this, mainly through a philosophical perspective, but you

39
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.120
also have a bit of theology to it. And

40
00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:05.529
then you also go through some of the science.

41
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.089
And later in our conversation, we're going to talk

42
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.229
about the relationship there between these three domains of

43
00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.554
knowledge, let's say, but you also go a little

44
00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:20.774
bit through the history of how philosophers have fought

45
00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:24.695
about time. So when it comes to the ancient

46
00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:29.384
philosophers, what were the main ideas they have about

47
00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:30.455
time? Exactly

48
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.610
of time or the metaphysics of time is really

49
00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:40.710
fascinating because it's in a sense unique in that

50
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.220
we've been asking very, very similar questions about time

51
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.009
for thousands of years and we still haven't really

52
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.750
come across any answers that everybody agrees on. So

53
00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.479
um it there are some really durable key concerns

54
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.029
there um there were of course different ways of

55
00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.520
tackling these questions across time. But we see embryonic

56
00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.589
forms of the debates and the metaphysics of time

57
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.440
today in the classical discussions. So one of the

58
00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.710
distinctions that is sometimes drawn is between the view

59
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.360
of Heraclius and the view of Parmenides. So Heraclius,

60
00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.809
uh well, we only have fragments of his texts,

61
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.339
but pe people via reconstruction have come to the

62
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.809
conclusion that Heraclius thought that everything was ultimately in

63
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.339
flux. And so the only thing that we can

64
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.169
be certain of is change itself, he famously said,

65
00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.259
uh you never step in the same river twice.

66
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.259
So uh everything is in flux and in motion

67
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.229
and these are early iterations of the kind of

68
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.630
ideas we see in the so called a theory

69
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.580
of time that says time objectively passes um in

70
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.190
the metaphysics of time today. Whereas Parmenides seemed to

71
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.470
believe that there was only one enduring universal substance

72
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.460
and that any change or motion was ultimately ultimately

73
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.399
an illusion. And so in that sense, uh we

74
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.960
must, must think of time itself as static and

75
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.789
unchanging as well. And that echoes the more contemporary

76
00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.880
theories of time known as the block universe or

77
00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.330
eternal or B or the B theory or C

78
00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.800
theory. And so even as far back as thousands

79
00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.210
of years ago, we're thinking about the nature of

80
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.250
time and whether time does pass or doesn't pass,

81
00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.649
and there's not been much more agreement since then

82
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.850
between scholars about that?

83
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.549
Mhm. Uh So some of those more modern theories

84
00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.670
of time that you're mentioning there, I mean, occur

85
00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:30.559
both in theoretical physics and also I guess the

86
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.510
philosophy of physics, right. Yeah. Mhm. And how about

87
00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:41.410
medieval philosophy? What were some of the more dominant

88
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.250
ideas during that period?

89
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.619
Yeah. So I'm not a medievalist, it's not my

90
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.950
area of specialism. So I, I do touch upon

91
00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.760
some of these in the book. Um But it's

92
00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:53.160
very much a snapshot view. It's a really rich

93
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.690
and interesting and complex uh historical period. And um

94
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.200
so I can only speak to the kind of

95
00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:01.970
snapshots that I provide in the book, but it

96
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.899
was a deeply religious time. And so lots of

97
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.619
the questions about time and temporality were considered in

98
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.029
relation to God and to theology. So some of

99
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.049
the key questions were that God experience time, is

100
00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.010
God inside time subject to the passage of time

101
00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:20.290
himself? Or is God outside of time and views

102
00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.940
all moments of time, like we would be looking

103
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.140
on to a painting. So he sees everything at

104
00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.790
once. Um And if that's the case, then what

105
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.540
are the implications for the creature or human beings

106
00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:34.489
relation to time? Um So, yeah, tho those sorts

107
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.049
of questions about God and God's relation to time,

108
00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:39.690
I think really dominated the period.

109
00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.320
Uh You mentioned there very briefly that uh the

110
00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.739
medieval period was one where people were really religious

111
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.709
and I mean, theology interrelated very much with philosophy.

112
00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:58.250
So was it really during this period or was

113
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.100
it earlier that questions surrounding the nature of time

114
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.959
interrelate with uh theological questions?

115
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.549
So we can see the connection between God and

116
00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.700
time going back almost as far as theology does?

117
00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:17.619
Because if you think about it, it in a

118
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.529
sense underlies lots of the other key theological questions.

119
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.369
So if we think of creation or the universe

120
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.130
as fundamentally temporal as structured in accordance with time,

121
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.640
then understanding how God relates to time is um

122
00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:35.000
is a prerequisite for understanding how God relates relates

123
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.790
to creation at all. And so I think theological

124
00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:40.529
writers uh throughout the generations have been aware of

125
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.390
this fact and therefore have seen time as something

126
00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.630
that is a really important theological resource.

127
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:50.829
So now, I in more recent times in the

128
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:55.040
20th and the 21st century, uh and we're focusing

129
00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:57.470
here mostly on philosophy of course, but you can

130
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.079
also talk about theoretical physics. What are the most

131
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:06.829
dominant ideas about time? Of course, earlier you mentioned

132
00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:10.790
in passing some of the main, some of the

133
00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:14.549
most dominant theories, but please give us a little

134
00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.750
bit more detail. I mean, what are the main

135
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.070
ways people think about time nowadays?

136
00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:24.809
So in a sense, we can think of pretty

137
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.869
much the entirety of the philosophy of time since

138
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.320
the 20th century as being written in the long

139
00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:33.660
shadow of a paper written by Jeremy McTaggart in

140
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.380
1908, McTaggart was concerned with um demonstrating that time

141
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.350
was in fact unreal. And in order to make

142
00:07:41.359 --> 00:07:44.010
this argument, he distinguished between a few different ways

143
00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:46.589
that we could describe time. So the first he

144
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.369
named the A series um and the A series

145
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.549
describes time um as being fundamentally construed by properties

146
00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:58.320
of objective tense. So past, present and future are

147
00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:02.429
fundamental components of time. Next, he described the B

148
00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:05.329
series which says that time is fundamentally composed of

149
00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.760
temporal relations before after and simultaneous with. And the

150
00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:11.779
third was the C series which has received a

151
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.130
lot less attention and this structures time in accordance

152
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.559
with the relations of temporal between us. So um

153
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.100
in a sense, the C series describes time a

154
00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:24.130
bit like a color spectrum and then it makes

155
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.239
sense being read either way um from the, from

156
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.940
the blue side to the red side. Um And

157
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.720
in the same sense, the C series says that

158
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.070
time can be understood just as adequately if you

159
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.440
view it from the beginning of the universe to

160
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.489
the end or the end of the universe from

161
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.590
the beginning. So these have since been rarified into

162
00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.130
fully fledged temporal, the theories, not just the and

163
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.380
so the a theory of time, there's a few

164
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.669
different ones, but generally, they'll all share the properties

165
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:55.580
of all the characteristics of saying that time objectively

166
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.750
passes. So there is generally believed to be an

167
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.469
unreal future, an objectively real present and a past

168
00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:07.510
which some a theories think the past does exist

169
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.789
and some think it doesn't. But what's important is

170
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:13.000
is there's this objective now, which is the same

171
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.380
across the entire universe. And that now acts as

172
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.880
a kind of frontier of becoming. So things pass

173
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.130
from the unreal future into the real present. And

174
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.539
in doing so they come into existence. So this

175
00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:28.599
kind of temporal theory can accommodate change objective becoming

176
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:31.479
temporal passage, all of the things that when we

177
00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:36.570
encounter the world we think exists. So uh I

178
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.289
I at the moment it's raining where I live

179
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.369
and I can see raindrops falling down from my

180
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.960
window sill and that seems to show that there's

181
00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:47.590
something dynamic happening there, there is, there is a

182
00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:52.090
moment of time where the water is just about

183
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:54.390
to drip off my window sill and a moment

184
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.039
where it's falling. Whereas the B and C theory

185
00:09:58.049 --> 00:10:01.900
of time deny that such passage is objective. So

186
00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:04.140
if you're a B theorist, you think the most

187
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.919
important features of time are the temporal ordering relations

188
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.960
of uh before and after. So what matters if

189
00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:14.119
you're giving a fundamental description of time is the

190
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.280
order that events are in and the fact that

191
00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:19.030
this order is structured from beginning to end. And

192
00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:23.119
once you've described the locations in the temporal series

193
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.150
of all of the events you you've described time.

194
00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:30.309
So in terms of what this means metaphysically, we

195
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.020
might think of time as a so called block

196
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.010
universe where moments in time are like points in

197
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.700
space, they all exist even if we can't see

198
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.539
them. So, uh just because I'm not in Egypt

199
00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:44.780
at the moment, it doesn't mean Egypt doesn't exist.

200
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.880
And the B theory says, well, just because I'm

201
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.190
not in 1977 at the moment doesn't mean that

202
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.849
1977 isn't objectively out there somewhere else in the

203
00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:56.919
universe. And the C series is also committed to

204
00:10:56.929 --> 00:10:59.340
the block universe. But instead of saying there's a

205
00:10:59.349 --> 00:11:01.799
as an objective order from past to present, it

206
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.820
just says that there is this block and you

207
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.700
can look at it in any direction as long

208
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.460
as you've got the events in the right order,

209
00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:10.320
it doesn't matter which end of time you start

210
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.479
with. So the metaphysics of time has largely focused

211
00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:19.080
on thinking about what these temporal theories mean, which

212
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.570
ones are correct and support is given to each

213
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.960
of these from different corners. So one of the

214
00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:27.809
fascinating things about time is that you can come

215
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.719
at it from so many different disciplinary perspectives. You

216
00:11:30.729 --> 00:11:33.869
can think about temporal experience. You can come up

217
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.929
with metaphysical arguments, you can come up with arguments

218
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.679
that examine temporal language and the truth claims of

219
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.440
temporal language. You can of course look to physics,

220
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.400
different branches of physics. You sometimes get different answers

221
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:48.919
about time. When you look at quantum physics, special

222
00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:51.599
relativity and general relativity. And obviously, we hope that

223
00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:53.390
that's not going to be the case, there's clues

224
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.210
and inconsistencies there in science that need to be

225
00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:58.510
worked out. But um yeah, the metaphysics of time

226
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.020
is really, really broad and really fascinating. And by

227
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.400
its very nature, I think interdisciplinary, we need to

228
00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:09.099
take into account experience, physics, language metaphysics when we're

229
00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:11.619
trying to come up with answers about the nature

230
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.140
of time and whether time passes or not.

231
00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:17.349
So I want to ask you now a question

232
00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:22.010
that is more directly related to uh physics, theoretical

233
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.340
physics about spacetime. But just before we get into

234
00:12:25.349 --> 00:12:28.479
that, I would like like to hear your thoughts

235
00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:33.119
on the question of how modern physics relates to

236
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.419
metaphysics because of course, it's one thing for us

237
00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:40.000
to have an understanding of time or an account

238
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.715
of time according to physics. Uh And people could

239
00:12:44.724 --> 00:12:47.625
say, OK, so that's the science of time or

240
00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.575
at least the physics of time because of course,

241
00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:52.505
we can also talk about the cognitive science of

242
00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:56.174
time, the psychology of time, which is not exactly

243
00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:58.604
the same thing as the the physics of time

244
00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:02.494
as we know. Uh But uh I mean, people

245
00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:05.655
who work on metaphysics do not necessarily have to

246
00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:11.760
agree that whatever physicists describe is the same as

247
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.320
metaphysics or that should be the metaphysical account of

248
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.700
reality, right? So how do you look at that

249
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.469
relationship?

250
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.429
Yeah, that's a really great question. I personally am

251
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.400
a huge fan of interdisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration. And

252
00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:30.590
I really don't think we can come to the

253
00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:33.729
right answers about life's biggest questions if we silo

254
00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:36.380
our academic disciplines and don't talk to each other.

255
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.539
So back in um the early modern period, the

256
00:13:41.549 --> 00:13:44.109
discipline, one of the primary academic disciplines is Natural

257
00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:49.309
philosophy, which involved theology, uh empirical experimentation, metaphysics, geometry,

258
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.690
maths. And we had a much more holistic understanding

259
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.080
of how to approach these big questions. Now you

260
00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.750
do sometimes see physicists and metaphysicians not really talking

261
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.109
to each other too much. And I think that's

262
00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:07.030
a problem. I mean, lots, lots of metaphysicians do

263
00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:11.659
engage with physics for, for good reason because we

264
00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:14.539
don't want to be just doing armchair philosophy. We

265
00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:16.140
don't want to just sit and reason and think

266
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.369
well, OK, let's think about how all of these

267
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.760
arguments work without actually looking at the world on

268
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.729
its own terms and seeing what the world says.

269
00:14:22.739 --> 00:14:27.059
So physics without philosophy, I think is lost because

270
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.760
it's just mathematics and data. And when you start

271
00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:33.869
building theories out of those, you're doing philosophy, some

272
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.440
physicists don't want to admit it, but that's what

273
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.039
they're doing. Uh And metaphysics, if you really want

274
00:14:38.049 --> 00:14:41.950
to delve deeply into reality and understand it, you

275
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.960
need to be looking at reality. So not just

276
00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:47.729
from the perspective of an abstract argument but from

277
00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:50.469
the perspective of an empirical science. So I think

278
00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:52.760
they need to have a really close relationship and

279
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.299
that doesn't mean that they need to collapse into

280
00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:57.809
each other. We need the particular skill sets of

281
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.380
each of these disciplines and each of the prac

282
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.710
practitioners of those disciplines in order to do the

283
00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:06.280
most rigorous work. But there should be open communication

284
00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:06.840
between them.

285
00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:10.429
Yes. And of course, I, I mean, the question

286
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.590
I was alluding to here or the, the comment

287
00:15:13.599 --> 00:15:15.960
I was alluding to here, let's say is that

288
00:15:15.969 --> 00:15:21.690
um the metaphysicians are not bound to uh I

289
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.570
mean, the compromise of deriving their metaphysics directly from

290
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.719
uh physics or theoretical physics, right? I mean, that's

291
00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:32.219
a debate to be had. Of course, I know

292
00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:37.109
that some physicists and also some philosophers uh start

293
00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:40.909
from the assumption that whatever the nature of reality

294
00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:45.809
is it is what physics uh says it is,

295
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.940
but that's just an assumption and it can be

296
00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:50.700
discussed, right?

297
00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:53.609
So it can be discussed. So the where I

298
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.549
sit on this question is I think, I think

299
00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:58.640
I am a naturalist, which means I think that

300
00:15:58.669 --> 00:16:01.080
in principle, science is able to explain a lot

301
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.690
of the uh questions about the world. But that

302
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.679
doesn't mean that it has currently got the right

303
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.239
answers. So I think there's a really important distinction

304
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.320
there between saying in principle, we are able to

305
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.979
arrive at answers to these questions via empirical means

306
00:16:14.989 --> 00:16:17.559
and then saying, oh, we have already done that

307
00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.510
and there's good reason to think that we probably

308
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.150
haven't got all of the answers yet because our

309
00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:24.539
two fundament physical theories ie general relativity and quantum

310
00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:28.039
mechanics fundamentally disagree. Um And they're not able to

311
00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:29.469
be reconciled at the moment. It's one of the

312
00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:32.919
biggest problems in physics and time features in both

313
00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:36.000
of these. And so we have competing descriptions of

314
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.909
time in a sense and we're, we're waiting for,

315
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.049
for the answers for a general for a theory

316
00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:45.109
of everything or a theory of quantum gravity that

317
00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:48.309
will hopefully advance some of our, maybe advance the

318
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.400
debate. I mean, who who knows? They might open

319
00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.960
even more questions than, than it gives answers. But

320
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.039
yeah, I think in principle, we should be able

321
00:16:57.049 --> 00:17:01.640
to reach answers empirically with help for metaphysics, but

322
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.559
it doesn't mean we're already there yet.

323
00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.618
And with all of those caveats in mind, what

324
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.358
is space time? I mean, what is the best

325
00:17:10.368 --> 00:17:14.660
understanding of space time we have through physics right

326
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:14.959
now?

327
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.680
So there are some disagreements about what space time

328
00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:27.060
is of a philosophical nature. So the two ways

329
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:31.520
of understanding spacetime are known as substantive and relation

330
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.189
is so substantially is the idea that space time

331
00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:38.439
is a substance. It's an entity, it exists, it's

332
00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:40.489
out there in the world. And even if you

333
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.160
took out all of the events, um everything out

334
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.489
of it, all of the objects, all of the

335
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.449
relations, you would still have something, there's a container

336
00:17:48.459 --> 00:17:52.425
there, which is space time within which everything happens.

337
00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:55.954
Whereas the relation is says, well, actually spacetime is

338
00:17:55.964 --> 00:17:58.824
emerging and it's, it emerges out of the relations

339
00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:01.265
between objects and events. So if you take the

340
00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:03.645
objects and events out of the universe, there's nothing

341
00:18:03.655 --> 00:18:08.064
left, there is no substance, ontological substance of spacetime.

342
00:18:08.074 --> 00:18:11.255
Instead, it's just, there's just relations between events. So

343
00:18:11.474 --> 00:18:14.145
the debate rages on between these two, I think

344
00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:15.994
if I had to hedge my bets, I think

345
00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:19.599
I would come down on substantive. But I, I

346
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.569
uh I'm saying that with a big pinch of

347
00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:22.650
salt, I'm not sure.

348
00:18:23.589 --> 00:18:26.890
Right. So I mean, the, the question I'm about

349
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.170
to ask you, you've, you've already alluded to some

350
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.030
aspects of it throughout our conversation. But uh also

351
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.890
for the audience to get a better understanding of

352
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.050
how the questions here are interrelated, like questions in

353
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.479
physics with questions in theology which for people who

354
00:18:46.489 --> 00:18:50.469
are more on the naturalistic end of the spectrum

355
00:18:50.479 --> 00:18:55.140
perhaps would be very hard to understand. Uh HOW

356
00:18:55.150 --> 00:19:01.609
does spacetime relate to theological questions and what theological

357
00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:04.540
questions are we exactly talking about here?

358
00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:11.020
So spacetime as we understand, it is comprised of

359
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.560
four dimensions, three dimensions of space and one dimension

360
00:19:14.569 --> 00:19:17.400
of time. So all of the questions that we

361
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.040
think about relating to God and time must be

362
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.359
considered in conversation with space time, I think um

363
00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:30.530
we also can think about questions about spatial location.

364
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.329
So does God exist at all moments in space?

365
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:36.949
What happened if the Christian religion is right. What

366
00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:40.050
happened when God entered space time, it through the

367
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.479
incarnation in a way that he wasn't present before

368
00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:45.800
is something like that really possible. Uh So those

369
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.770
are the kind of spatial questions we might answer.

370
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.530
I mean, there's lots more, but those are the

371
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.170
kind of primary ones. And then um with relation

372
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.290
to God and the time dimension. Yeah, it's, it's

373
00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.439
largely questions about whether God exists inside time or

374
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.599
outside of time. But we also might want to

375
00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:04.900
think about what the nature of space time means

376
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.209
for human beings and certain theological questions that concern

377
00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:13.849
human beings. So, one of the key doctrines in

378
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.050
Christianity is the doctrine of salvation. And one of

379
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.199
the key things I'm looking at in my book

380
00:20:19.209 --> 00:20:23.599
is, can we understand the Christian doctrine of salvation

381
00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:28.089
classically conceived in the context of spacetime and do

382
00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:31.469
the different interpretations of space time yield different answers

383
00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:33.790
to questions about is salvation possible? What does salvation

384
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.550
look like? Can there be a scatological redemption and

385
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.410
bodily resurrection? So there's a huge number of questions.

386
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.510
I mean, as I said before, the nature of

387
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.489
time, the nature of space are really foundational in

388
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.739
understanding reality and the human beings that live within

389
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.150
it. And those are key theological issues. So you,

390
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.329
you can't, in my opinion, you can't really do

391
00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:56.500
theology without thinking about space time and of course,

392
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.130
space time.

393
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.569
So let's unpack that a little bit and to

394
00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:03.150
do that, let's go through some of the main

395
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.699
questions that you explore in your book actually. So

396
00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:10.540
starting with the nature of God. So uh first

397
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.189
of all, perhaps, let me ask you, what is

398
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.609
the uh I mean, what are questions related to

399
00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:19.599
the nature of God? What is the problem, let's

400
00:21:19.609 --> 00:21:22.089
say of the nature of God, what are we

401
00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:24.699
trying to really get at here?

402
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.469
So the God of classical theism is believed to

403
00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:32.969
have certain properties um and have those properties maximally.

404
00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:36.270
So this is sometimes called perfect being theology. And

405
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.390
some of the properties that are often cited are

406
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.089
omniscient, which is being all knowing, omnipotent being all

407
00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:49.349
powerful, uh omni benevolent being all loving simplicity, meaning

408
00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:52.640
not comprised of any component parts, the attributes being

409
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:57.739
essential, the properties um uh Yeah, of one's essence

410
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.329
and existence being one and the same. Um So

411
00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:03.930
what we're trying to think about with questions of

412
00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:07.060
God and time is can which interpretations of time

413
00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:10.530
or which understandings of time are compatible with those

414
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.770
properties? So different in different understandings of God's relation

415
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:20.040
to time, yield different problems or concerns for some

416
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.699
of these properties. And I'm happy to talk through

417
00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:25.050
those in uh in more detail. Yeah. So um

418
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.380
let's think about the idea that God is inside

419
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.810
of time first and then we'll think about God

420
00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:35.290
being outside of time. So if God is inside

421
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.000
of time, then God is subject to the passage

422
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.239
of time, God can only directly experience what is

423
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.569
happening now. Um And so let, let's think about

424
00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:49.050
some of the problems this might raise. If God

425
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.609
is supposed to be all powerful, then this seems

426
00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:54.930
to really, really limit God's ability to access and

427
00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:58.270
experience parts of time that aren't happening now. This

428
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.790
is called the prisoner of time objection. And some

429
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.329
people have been really concerned with this idea that

430
00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:06.609
God by being temporal would be somehow subservient to

431
00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:09.050
time, subject to its passing in a way that

432
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.239
doesn't fit with God being all powerful. There are

433
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.530
some responses to this. So Richard Swinburne, for example,

434
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.680
says that God has chosen to limit his power

435
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:21.300
in this sense because it's theologically worthwhile for God

436
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.000
to do so. This was an act of choice.

437
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.520
So it's not a limit of God's power. It's

438
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.910
an actualization of God's power in a way that

439
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.520
some that limits some of the things he can

440
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.760
do because there are other benefits that come from

441
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:36.199
it. Um So another problem with God being inside

442
00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:41.689
of time is that it seems to make God

443
00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:45.290
an object among objects and classically God is thought

444
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.920
of as being transcendent. So being outside of and

445
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.170
above and far more than the created universe. And

446
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.550
so if God is inside of time, then it

447
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.199
seems like God is an object among objects. And

448
00:23:57.209 --> 00:23:59.189
that doesn't seem to fit with the classical conception

449
00:23:59.199 --> 00:24:02.069
of God. So those are a couple of problems.

450
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:04.689
There are more. But um let's stick with those

451
00:24:04.699 --> 00:24:06.849
for now. But then there are some benefits to

452
00:24:06.859 --> 00:24:10.329
being inside of time. So if you're inside of

453
00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:13.530
time, then you can have an ongoing relationship with

454
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.939
the creatures or the beings within time. So as

455
00:24:16.949 --> 00:24:20.130
a creature or an individual's life unfolds, God can

456
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.729
be present in the unfolding of that lifetime. God

457
00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:25.729
can act in the world in ways that seem

458
00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:28.400
much more easy to understand God can respond to

459
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.520
petitionary prayer. Um And so there are, there are

460
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.359
benefits that people have seen with the God being

461
00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:38.030
inside of time. And what's, what's worth noting here

462
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.699
as well is that lots of contemporary theologians are

463
00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:42.349
now arguing that actually, if you look at the

464
00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:46.770
Bible, that seems to be much more supportive of

465
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.459
God being inside of time, even though the classical

466
00:24:50.469 --> 00:24:52.540
conception of God is that God is outside of

467
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.500
time. And that was the medieval consensus. And the

468
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.619
reason for that is that God is understood to

469
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.479
be perfect. And Plato made this argument that perfect

470
00:25:02.489 --> 00:25:05.739
beings cannot change because any change would be a,

471
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.959
a degradation from perfection. If you're already perfect, then

472
00:25:08.969 --> 00:25:12.060
the only way is down in a sense. So

473
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.599
God needs to be changeless. And if we think

474
00:25:14.609 --> 00:25:16.520
of change in time as being intimately connected, then

475
00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.300
God cannot be temporal, a God who's outside of

476
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.180
time is also able to be transcendent, is able

477
00:25:23.189 --> 00:25:26.099
to see everything in time at once. And so

478
00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:28.619
has perfect knowledge of everything that happens. Whereas the

479
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.680
God that's inside of time might only be able

480
00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:32.500
to have direct knowledge of what's happening now and

481
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.280
can't know the future, which seems to be a

482
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.699
limit of knowledge. Um And the, yeah, the God

483
00:25:38.709 --> 00:25:41.839
outside of time, I mean, in a sense, yes,

484
00:25:41.849 --> 00:25:44.420
it was the, it was largely supported in medieval

485
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.770
times. But even now the so called God of

486
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.199
the philosophers, the God that philosophers of religion tend

487
00:25:49.209 --> 00:25:51.939
to talk about seems to be much more conducive

488
00:25:51.949 --> 00:25:54.329
to this idea of God being outside of time.

489
00:25:54.589 --> 00:25:57.739
So, um sorry, that was a really long answer.

490
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.660
But just unpacking some of the implications of the

491
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.890
nature of God and the different temporal models of

492
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.219
the God time relationship.

493
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.260
So uh let me ask you a question sort

494
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.910
of related to that. Uh I mean, this might

495
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.400
sound a bit unsophisticated because again, I don't read

496
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:20.510
uh lots of uh literature on theology and philosophy

497
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.209
of religion perhaps. But um if uh and please

498
00:26:25.219 --> 00:26:27.900
correct me if this idea is wrong, but if

499
00:26:27.959 --> 00:26:32.339
the idea is that God created the universe, then

500
00:26:32.349 --> 00:26:36.969
I would assume that people would also with that

501
00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:41.890
assumption would come, the assumption that God would stand

502
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.640
outside of the universe that he created, right? So

503
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:52.050
if that's true, then wouldn't that immediately and necessarily

504
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.719
implicate that he also stands outside of space time.

505
00:26:56.729 --> 00:27:00.439
And so would necessarily be a temporal,

506
00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:04.239
yes, that is one of the arguments that people

507
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.060
make. And I think it's a very powerful one.

508
00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:09.099
If God is fundamentally temporal and time is part

509
00:27:09.109 --> 00:27:11.349
of physical creation, then there must have been at

510
00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:14.890
least some period in God's lifetime where there was

511
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.079
no temporal dimension. And so yeah, that's a very

512
00:27:18.089 --> 00:27:21.300
good argument. And another argument that's quite similar is

513
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.060
according to our understanding of space time, if something

514
00:27:25.069 --> 00:27:27.479
has a spatial location, they have a temporal location.

515
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.709
And if something has a temporal location, it has

516
00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:32.469
a spatial location. But because God is not a

517
00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:35.290
spatial or physical being, God does not exist in

518
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.400
space and therefore God doesn't exist in time either.

519
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.540
So I, I think there's probably more powerful reasons

520
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.540
to think that God is outside of time than

521
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.380
inside of time if God exists. But I come

522
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.770
at it from a philosophical perspective and theologians and

523
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.290
biblical scholars tend to prefer the idea that God

524
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.510
is inside of time because the Bible seems to

525
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.000
talk about God as having a history that unfolds.

526
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.760
Uh AND that has and that God dynamically responds

527
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.199
to the unfolding of world history in a way

528
00:28:04.209 --> 00:28:06.959
that's hard to imagine for a God that's outside

529
00:28:06.969 --> 00:28:10.439
of time. So the debates rage on basically.

530
00:28:11.239 --> 00:28:14.300
So the nature of God is one question, the

531
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.739
second one has to do with human salvation. So

532
00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:21.520
in what ways would the problem of spacetime connect

533
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.060
to the nature and scope of human salvation?

534
00:28:26.069 --> 00:28:28.270
So I think the best understanding of space and

535
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.579
time is one that is consonant with the B

536
00:28:31.589 --> 00:28:34.189
theory of time. And this is the block universe

537
00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:36.920
view. And so according to the block universe, all

538
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.189
moments of space and time exist in a four

539
00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:44.250
dimensional in um yeah, four dimensional Minkowski spacetime basically.

540
00:28:44.319 --> 00:28:46.780
And what that means is every moment of your

541
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.270
life exists. You are in a sense are a

542
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.329
four dimensional worm spread out, spread out in space

543
00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:56.989
time. Even though we experience only slices that space

544
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.140
time in our immediate perception. What this means is

545
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.099
the person I was when I was five, the

546
00:29:03.109 --> 00:29:07.420
person I was when I was 1217, 25 all

547
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.250
of those versions of me exist as well as

548
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.199
all of the versions of me that are 30

549
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:18.020
35 50 7080. If I live that long, one

550
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.290
of the things that Christianity is committed to is

551
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.089
the idea that we can undergo a process of

552
00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:28.310
transformation ie personal salvation that you can go from

553
00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:30.170
being fallen at one point in your life to

554
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.349
being saved at a later point, or at least

555
00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:34.900
begin to be saved. Even if the ultimate salvation

556
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.540
happens after the end of the universe or the

557
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.310
end of your temporal life. But if all moments

558
00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:43.839
of time exist and all versions of you exist,

559
00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:45.859
then it's difficult to see how you can actually

560
00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:49.650
objectively change from being fallen to being saved. All

561
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.849
you can say is you're fallen there and saved

562
00:29:51.859 --> 00:29:55.359
there. And that seems to be in my view,

563
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.680
in contradiction with what Christianity teaches about the idea

564
00:29:58.689 --> 00:30:01.800
of personal salvation. So I think there are ways

565
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.640
around this, but they're probably not as robust as

566
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.569
the Christian theologian would like. My solution to this

567
00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:12.780
is to say, well, we should probably think of

568
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.619
salvation as something subjective and phenomenological. So it's a

569
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.000
product of our experience, we experience ourselves changing from

570
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.250
fallen to being saved. And for us that constitutes

571
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.270
personal salvation, even though it doesn't mean that we

572
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.709
have objectively changed from fallen to being saved. This

573
00:30:31.719 --> 00:30:35.109
works for me. But there are related problems ie

574
00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:39.099
the idea that sin is eliminated. So Christianity again

575
00:30:39.109 --> 00:30:42.439
teaches that sin will ultimately be eliminated. But if

576
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:44.959
the block universe is the correct understanding of reality,

577
00:30:44.969 --> 00:30:48.040
then no past sin is eliminated, it's still there

578
00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:52.979
even if we aren't in the same location. So

579
00:30:52.989 --> 00:30:55.420
the problem of disappearing sin or the problem of

580
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.270
the elimination of evil remains on the block universe.

581
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.420
And for that reason, again, some theologians and theists

582
00:31:01.579 --> 00:31:04.660
are inclined to say that a different interpretation of

583
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.380
spacetime is true. One that's more consonant with the

584
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.020
a theory of time. So the idea that there

585
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.540
is an objective now and no future and no

586
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.689
past. And if that's true, this is called present

587
00:31:15.699 --> 00:31:18.479
is, and if present is is true, then it

588
00:31:18.489 --> 00:31:21.760
is possible to eliminate past evil. Because once something

589
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.579
that ceases to be present, it ceases to exist.

590
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.400
And so in that sense, you can undergo an

591
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.000
objective change from being fallen to being saved and

592
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.390
the sin can vanish out of reality. So in

593
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.119
terms of personal salvation, you might be more inclined

594
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.920
to be an atheist rather than a B theorist

595
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.020
and believe in a understanding of space time. That

596
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.739
is not really the kind of understanding that most

597
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.030
physicists would endorse either the block universe understanding of

598
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.530
space time that's supported by Einstein's relativity theories.

599
00:31:51.819 --> 00:31:55.199
A and in a sort of related question, what

600
00:31:55.209 --> 00:31:59.439
do we know from physics about the possible end

601
00:31:59.449 --> 00:32:02.719
of the universe? And if the universe comes to

602
00:32:02.729 --> 00:32:05.609
an end, wherever it might be, what sort of

603
00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:09.319
implications would that have for salvation?

604
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.300
So we're not entirely sure whether the universe will

605
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.010
come to an end or not, but we think

606
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.579
now that it probably will. So there's two end

607
00:32:20.589 --> 00:32:23.949
scenarios uh for the universe, one is freeze, which

608
00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:25.579
is the heat death of the universe, which is

609
00:32:25.589 --> 00:32:29.130
the idea that the universe expands and cools until

610
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.969
and everything decays until it's a sort of soup

611
00:32:31.979 --> 00:32:36.250
of radiation. Um And nothing can live in such

612
00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.229
an environment. So that's freeze and fry is the

613
00:32:39.239 --> 00:32:42.099
idea that the universe collapses back in on itself

614
00:32:42.109 --> 00:32:44.829
in um a big crunch. Basically the opposite of

615
00:32:44.839 --> 00:32:47.199
a big bang. So we don't know, this depends

616
00:32:47.209 --> 00:32:49.969
on um the amount of matter in the universe

617
00:32:49.979 --> 00:32:51.660
and the strength of gravity and the value of

618
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.469
the cosmological constant and the expansion of the universe.

619
00:32:54.479 --> 00:32:56.380
So there's lots of parameters that go into it.

620
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.099
But basically, at the moment, the universe is expanding,

621
00:32:59.109 --> 00:33:01.969
we don't know if it's gonna keep expanding forever

622
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.739
or if it's going to like a stretched elastic

623
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.739
band ricochet back and ultimately collapse back in on

624
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.569
itself. Either of these seem to indicate that the

625
00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:14.630
universe is going to come to an end. So

626
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.500
when we're thinking about other claims within Christianity, like

627
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.150
the fact that creation will be transformed into a

628
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.910
new creation, or that individuals will undergo bodily resurrection,

629
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.530
uh Some, some problems are raised and it's the

630
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.280
inverse um of the previous problem in that the

631
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.949
A theory is unhelpful and the B theory is

632
00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:37.439
helpful. So basically, whichever position the theist takes is

633
00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:40.619
a problem. The reason the A theory is problematic

634
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.839
for bodily resurrection is that in order for there

635
00:33:43.849 --> 00:33:45.900
to be bodily resurrection, you need to have a

636
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.640
body. But if the universe comes to an end,

637
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.290
then everything is destroyed, there is no body left

638
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.810
to be resurrected. So if there are, if there

639
00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:56.719
is bodily resurrection, at the end of times, it

640
00:33:56.729 --> 00:33:58.520
would have to be the creation of some new

641
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.079
body. And that's not what Christianity teaches. But if

642
00:34:02.089 --> 00:34:04.709
you're a B theorist, even if the universe comes

643
00:34:04.719 --> 00:34:06.810
to an end, at the end of the, the

644
00:34:06.819 --> 00:34:09.540
last page in the book of the Block Universe,

645
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:14.000
if you like all moments, still exist. So the

646
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.168
body is still retrievable. Bodily resurrection is still possible

647
00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:20.770
and creation still exists to be transformed. Christianity doesn't

648
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:26.228
teach about a completely spontaneous new creation and new

649
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.949
bodies created out of nothing. That's how this universe

650
00:34:28.958 --> 00:34:31.938
came into being. But the idea within Christianity is

651
00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.790
that this substance, the universe, the beings in it

652
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.208
will become transformed at the end of time. And

653
00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.870
if you have an A theory, then it seems

654
00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:42.449
like there's nothing left to be transformed. Once the

655
00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:46.608
heat death or big crunch happens, there's nothing. And

656
00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:48.197
so that's a, that's a big problem as well.

657
00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:50.089
And that's something that scholars in science and religion,

658
00:34:50.099 --> 00:34:51.958
which is the discipline that I one of the

659
00:34:51.967 --> 00:34:53.958
disciplines I'm in. Uh THEY'VE given this quite a

660
00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:56.018
lot of attention and some of them have said,

661
00:34:56.029 --> 00:34:57.908
look, we're just gonna have to hope that God

662
00:34:57.918 --> 00:35:01.029
intervenes before the end of the universe in order

663
00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:04.158
to avoid some of these problems. So it's a,

664
00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:07.599
it's a lively area of scholarship. But one of

665
00:35:07.608 --> 00:35:09.448
the things I argue in my book is that

666
00:35:09.549 --> 00:35:11.249
whether you, if you're a theist, if you're a

667
00:35:11.259 --> 00:35:16.189
Christian theist, then space time, space and time itself

668
00:35:16.209 --> 00:35:20.169
raises significant problems for salvation and eschatology, either there's

669
00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:22.340
no body to be resurrected or sin can't be

670
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.830
eliminated. And so you have to really take on

671
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.510
both of these problems. If you want to be

672
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.830
Christian theist who is engaged with and interested in

673
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.989
the nature of time and the auto of space

674
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.229
time.

675
00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:40.800
And in theology, are there alternatives to bodily resurrection?

676
00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.639
I mean, could resurrection happen in a, in a

677
00:35:44.649 --> 00:35:47.370
non material way, let's say.

678
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.790
Yeah. So it definitely could. I mean, if the

679
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.139
idea of an immortal soul or um, something of

680
00:35:55.149 --> 00:35:59.800
that nature, but that's not what strictly, that's not

681
00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.300
what Christianity has historically taught. We might want to,

682
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.370
um, as, as theologians, theologians might want to say.

683
00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:09.739
Ok, well, we, that previous theology was based on

684
00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.270
uh knowledge that wasn't informed by science. So maybe

685
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.219
we do need to rethink things, maybe bodies will

686
00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:18.290
be created completely new out of nothing. Maybe it

687
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.520
will be the resurrection of the soul only. But

688
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.100
Christians base a lot of their understandings about what

689
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.620
happens eschatological on what happened to Jesus and Jesus

690
00:36:27.629 --> 00:36:31.550
physical body, the same body with the scars um

691
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.340
from being crucified, was resurrected. And so, and that's

692
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.939
supposed to be a sign and a symbol of

693
00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:39.489
what's to come. So you can try and get

694
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.939
out of these problems. But you would have to

695
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:44.489
deviate from some of the core claims of Christianity

696
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.080
now because I'm not a Christian. I don't see

697
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.770
that as a huge problem. Um But if you're

698
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.370
a Christian, that might be quite an unappealing uh

699
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:53.919
road to go down.

700
00:36:54.689 --> 00:36:57.300
Mhm But, II, I mean, ju just to see

701
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:02.229
if I, if I understand this, why do we

702
00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:07.149
need bodily resurrection for us to have uh things

703
00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:14.489
like uh salvation, redemption and basically the elimination of

704
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.020
uh sin. Why, why do we need that? Exactly.

705
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.870
Well,

706
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.719
I don't think we do need that. I don't

707
00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:24.620
think it's necessary, but it's part of the Christian

708
00:37:24.629 --> 00:37:27.179
story. So if you are a Christian, you need

709
00:37:27.189 --> 00:37:29.129
it because that's what it says in the Bible.

710
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.939
Um And if you, if you want to have

711
00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:34.060
understandings of life after death that aren't Christian or

712
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.709
that are, that take elements of Christianity, but go

713
00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:41.290
beyond it, that's totally fine. But an orthodox Christian

714
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.050
will say bodily resurrection is a core component of

715
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.610
the Christian world view because Jesus died and was

716
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.100
risen again. So in that sense, it's a core

717
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.790
Christian claim that lots of people don't want to

718
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.310
abandon.

719
00:37:55.169 --> 00:37:59.510
And uh I, I mean, apart from resurrection, there's

720
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.320
also the alternative, if I understood it correctly of

721
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:08.260
a new creation, right? So what would that, sorry,

722
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.219
what would that entail? And in what ways would

723
00:38:12.229 --> 00:38:16.870
that possibly be constrained by our understanding of space

724
00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:17.229
time?

725
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.169
Well, I think the idea of a new creation

726
00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:23.429
is best I understand it is that some this

727
00:38:23.439 --> 00:38:30.060
physical universe will be transformed into something, um something

728
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.550
better, something that fully realizes God's purposes for creation.

729
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.379
And in that process, um the problems of this

730
00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:41.300
creation will be overcome or redeemed. And so the

731
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.000
problem that I'm raising is just and that other

732
00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.310
people have raised as well is that you need

733
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.570
to have a physical cosmos in order to transform

734
00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.820
it, you need to have the bodies of individual

735
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.250
people. If you want to have bodily resurrection, and

736
00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.449
you need to have this world around us if

737
00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.850
you want to transform it. And so if the

738
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.260
universe does end and everything disappears out of existence,

739
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.350
that claim seems pretty hard to just five scientifically.

740
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.580
And so some Christians just don't want to engage

741
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.389
with the science, some of them engage with the

742
00:39:11.399 --> 00:39:14.340
science, but say science has a limit and ultimately

743
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.750
theological knowledge and theological understanding should always take precedence

744
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.750
over scientific insights. And some people want to take

745
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.949
the science very seriously and say, look, maybe we

746
00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:27.729
need to reimagine what's supposed to happen theologically because

747
00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:30.790
science teaches us uh Xy and Z you know

748
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.310
that the universe comes to an end or something.

749
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.060
So, uh how do you look at the relationship

750
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:41.159
between science and theology? Because of course, we know

751
00:39:41.169 --> 00:39:45.260
that there's a big schism, I guess between the

752
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:50.659
scientists and the theologians or the religious people sometimes.

753
00:39:50.669 --> 00:39:54.340
So, uh and it seems to be uh theoretically

754
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.110
speaking and intellectually speaking, uh very hard to reconcile

755
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.199
them. A at least with the way we approach

756
00:40:02.209 --> 00:40:06.820
things nowadays since particularly the enlightenment and so on.

757
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.860
So, um how do you look at the relationship

758
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.879
and ho how do you think we could perhaps

759
00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.820
reconcile them and perhaps even through the kinds of

760
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:19.629
questions that you explore in your book,

761
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.330
this is a really, really important question. And I

762
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.629
think it's, it's a fascinating one because there's a,

763
00:40:26.639 --> 00:40:28.989
there's an academic discipline called science and religion, of

764
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.169
which I'm part, which emerged halfway through the 20th

765
00:40:32.179 --> 00:40:36.100
century. It was pioneered by physicists who were religious

766
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:39.840
and wanted to engage physics and Christianity primarily with

767
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.830
each other. And the discipline now is really broad

768
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.050
and really fascinating and, and a very, very lively

769
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.699
and dynamic area of scholarship, which I think is

770
00:40:48.709 --> 00:40:50.659
gonna be one of the biggest areas of theology

771
00:40:50.669 --> 00:40:56.639
moving forward. And, and so in the discipline of

772
00:40:56.649 --> 00:41:02.010
science and religion, we see the two as very

773
00:41:02.909 --> 00:41:06.520
easily brought into dialogue with each other, perfectly compatible

774
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.399
in some areas, obviously not compatible in others. But

775
00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:13.989
in the wider, in wider society, the public seem

776
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.320
to see science and religion as completely contradictory. Now,

777
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.959
this is really interesting, why do scholars in the

778
00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:21.270
field see it so differently to the public? And

779
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.709
I think part of the reason that that's the

780
00:41:22.719 --> 00:41:25.550
case is because of the new atheist movement that

781
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.870
was prominent in the early two thousands. But also

782
00:41:28.879 --> 00:41:31.175
going back to Victoria England, there are two scholars

783
00:41:31.185 --> 00:41:35.895
called Draper and White who publicized and popularized this

784
00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:38.675
idea that science and religion are in conflict and

785
00:41:38.685 --> 00:41:41.425
are in internal perennial warfare and that they can

786
00:41:41.435 --> 00:41:43.895
never be compatible. But you need to make certain

787
00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:46.064
assumptions for that to be the case. And a

788
00:41:46.074 --> 00:41:48.235
couple of those assumptions are you need to assume

789
00:41:48.245 --> 00:41:51.465
that each discipline is fighting over the same territory.

790
00:41:51.864 --> 00:41:54.784
So religion is trying to explain everything and science

791
00:41:54.794 --> 00:41:57.024
is trying to explain everything. And if they say

792
00:41:57.034 --> 00:41:59.495
different things, then there must be a conflict or

793
00:41:59.504 --> 00:42:02.379
a clash. And the other one is that science

794
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.780
can be neatly defined and clearly bounded and religion

795
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.520
can be neatly defined and clearly bounded. And that's

796
00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.520
not true today or historically. So what we mean

797
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.070
by religion has changed so much over time, we

798
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.800
didn't even have the term religion. 100 years ago,

799
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.919
we just had the Latin term religio, which meant

800
00:42:18.929 --> 00:42:23.979
personal piety. It was after Europeans explored and colonized

801
00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:27.560
other cultures and saw different spiritual practices that they

802
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.550
realized, ok, maybe there's something we need to name

803
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.100
here, that's, that mirrors Christianity in certain ways and

804
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.979
that's where the idea of religion or world religions

805
00:42:35.989 --> 00:42:39.350
came about. But how religion was defined was really

806
00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.939
deeply affected by this Eurocentric Christian centric understanding of

807
00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:45.949
what religion is. So religion is belief, religion is

808
00:42:45.959 --> 00:42:49.139
about belief in God. Um Religion is primarily text

809
00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:51.830
based. Uh WHEREAS lots of religions are actually more

810
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.540
about spiritual practice, about ritual, about community. And if

811
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.550
you define religion in that way, it's difficult to

812
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.870
see how it can be in contradiction with science.

813
00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:03.570
And similarly, it assumes that science has a single

814
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.110
perspective on important issues that can be in conflict

815
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.020
with religion. But we know that that's not true

816
00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:12.209
because scientists disagree all the time about the correct

817
00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:15.219
interpretation of the data about which theories are right.

818
00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:18.340
So for example, uh drawing from my own work

819
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.620
on quantum mechanics, there are several empirically equivalent interpretations

820
00:43:22.629 --> 00:43:25.800
of quantum mechanics, each of which paints a completely

821
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.610
different picture of reality. So the ever in many

822
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.699
worlds interpretation says that reality is comprised of uh

823
00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:35.310
a multiverse where the universe branches into a multiplicity

824
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.949
of other universes every second. Uh And then you

825
00:43:37.959 --> 00:43:40.939
have the Copenhagen interpretation which says something completely different

826
00:43:40.949 --> 00:43:43.949
that just says the universe exists. Um And there's

827
00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:46.899
a level of quantum randomness at its most fundamental

828
00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:50.530
level. And these are two radically different physical theories

829
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.120
that interpret the same data and the same mathematics.

830
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.030
So there is no scientific perspective that can be

831
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.949
in conflict with religion because there is no religious

832
00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:05.199
perspective either that contradicts with science. So that's, that's

833
00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.500
why um I don't think, I think it's a

834
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.280
common misconception that science and religion are incompatible and

835
00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.629
I think actually they're not, but that doesn't mean

836
00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:15.780
that there's perfect synergy between them far from it.

837
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:19.800
You do see certain religious groups who are very,

838
00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:23.149
very skeptical or even distrusting of science. So we

839
00:44:23.159 --> 00:44:26.989
saw that recently in the COVID pandemic, um evangelicals

840
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.949
in the United States were very, very wary of

841
00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:33.729
the vaccine and didn't want to engage with modern

842
00:44:33.739 --> 00:44:36.159
science, didn't trust that the experts had their best

843
00:44:36.169 --> 00:44:38.389
interests at heart. We also see it with certain

844
00:44:38.399 --> 00:44:41.600
religious groups and evolution as well. Denying that evolution

845
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.860
is the correct explanation of the origin of humanity

846
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.110
and the origin of species on earth. And we

847
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.379
also see some scientists painting religion as backwards looking

848
00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:56.610
or dogmatic or um run by corrupt authorities. And

849
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.199
I mean, in a sense, there are some, there

850
00:44:58.209 --> 00:45:01.989
are a lot of very religious authorities out there.

851
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.120
So there are of course elements of tension between

852
00:45:05.129 --> 00:45:07.090
science and religion and there are individual ideas that

853
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.520
come into conflict with each other. But the relationship

854
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.580
between science and religion is so much more complex

855
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.469
and rich and nuanced than that. So that's the

856
00:45:14.479 --> 00:45:15.580
first thing I'd like to say that it's a

857
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.899
common misconception that science and religion are in conflict.

858
00:45:17.909 --> 00:45:20.860
They don't have to be it. That idea relies

859
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.500
on certain assumptions that you can't justify as for

860
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.729
their actual relationship. I think it's really difficult to

861
00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:31.370
characterize it in one neat single way because science

862
00:45:31.379 --> 00:45:33.550
is so broad because religion is so broad and

863
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.590
because throughout history, they've had periods where science um

864
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.429
was largely funded by religion. So the Catholic church

865
00:45:40.439 --> 00:45:42.899
funded lots of early modern science. Then you've had

866
00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:45.929
periods where religion and science or religious people and

867
00:45:45.939 --> 00:45:50.060
scientific minds came into conflict particularly over evolution when

868
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:55.199
it was first um proposed. So I think the

869
00:45:55.209 --> 00:45:57.919
best way of characterizing the science and religion relationship

870
00:45:57.929 --> 00:46:00.360
is one of complexity. This is an idea put

871
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.939
forward by the Historian of Science, John Hedley Brook.

872
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.050
So you said that science and religion are so

873
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.459
deeply rooted in human concerns and human endeavor that

874
00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:12.610
we can't extract them from the context in which

875
00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.239
they emerge and say science relates to religion in

876
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.199
this way. Instead, we have to look at this

877
00:46:17.209 --> 00:46:22.280
messy complexity of religious ideas, scientific ideas, philosophical ideas,

878
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.360
and the individual historical actors that brought those ideas

879
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.719
into dialogue. So I think science and religion can

880
00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:34.520
be seen as mutually enriching as uh foils to

881
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.879
each other um as ways to sharpen each other's

882
00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.649
ideas. And i it's really difficult to say in

883
00:46:39.659 --> 00:46:42.459
a nutshell what the relationship is. But I do

884
00:46:42.469 --> 00:46:46.879
think there's a real value in interdisciplinary scholarship. Science

885
00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:51.510
and religion are two of the primary ways, big

886
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.510
narratives, huge ideas that humans have come up with

887
00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:57.270
to explain our place in the world. And so

888
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.879
it's really fascinating to bring those together. How has

889
00:47:01.449 --> 00:47:04.669
2000 years of theological history understood the nature of

890
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:06.500
the human being and the nature of the reality

891
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.469
in which we live? How has science understood these

892
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.469
similar questions? And are there resonances between them? So

893
00:47:13.479 --> 00:47:16.290
this, it's a really, really productive area of scholarship

894
00:47:16.379 --> 00:47:18.770
that I would encourage anyone who's interested to delve

895
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.169
deeper into. There's a lot of compatibility there and

896
00:47:22.179 --> 00:47:24.750
when there is friction when there is conflict, it's

897
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.370
really interesting to get into the nitty gritty of

898
00:47:26.379 --> 00:47:26.969
that as well.

899
00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.760
Uh But there's also a third pillar here that

900
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:34.899
is philosophy. So how would you look at uh

901
00:47:34.909 --> 00:47:39.330
philosophy in relation to science and theology? I mean,

902
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.270
is it at the intersection of both or where

903
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.350
would you place it?

904
00:47:45.209 --> 00:47:48.510
So philosophy is definitely its own discipline and it

905
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.699
predates the other two. So uh philosophy has a

906
00:47:52.709 --> 00:48:00.510
really rich and informative history that has tackled pretty

907
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.500
much all of the big and important questions that

908
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.409
we have about ourselves and about the world that

909
00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:07.149
we live in. So difficult questions. Like what's the

910
00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:09.219
nature of the good? Uh How do we live

911
00:48:09.229 --> 00:48:11.550
a good life? How do we become virtuous? How

912
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.110
should we live together in a society to questions

913
00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.189
about identity? You know, what does it take for

914
00:48:16.199 --> 00:48:19.409
an individual to be the same individual across time?

915
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.479
Um What does ultimate reality consist in? Is there

916
00:48:24.489 --> 00:48:27.429
something beyond this material plane? Can everything be reduced

917
00:48:27.439 --> 00:48:32.399
down to material causes a material matter? Or is

918
00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:34.800
everything actually existing in the mind of an evil

919
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.399
demon? I mean, philosophy's philosophies come up with loads

920
00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:41.840
of really interesting conversations and questions relating to reality.

921
00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:44.679
So it's definitely not just at the intersection of

922
00:48:44.689 --> 00:48:48.270
science and religion, but that being said, I think

923
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.406
it's the most useful tool when you doing science

924
00:48:50.416 --> 00:48:52.916
and religion. So other other science and religion, scholars

925
00:48:52.926 --> 00:48:55.976
disagree and prefer to engage pure science with pure

926
00:48:55.986 --> 00:48:59.575
theology. I think philosophy is really valuable because it's

927
00:48:59.585 --> 00:49:01.605
like a common language you can translate them both

928
00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:04.565
into. So you can say here's the science, let's

929
00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:06.696
distill that to a set of philosophical principles or

930
00:49:06.706 --> 00:49:09.766
philosophical arguments, claims. And we can do the same

931
00:49:09.775 --> 00:49:12.236
with religion. And then suddenly, instead of having two

932
00:49:12.246 --> 00:49:14.246
things that exist on very different planes and that

933
00:49:14.256 --> 00:49:17.531
it's hard to easily bring them into conversation. You

934
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:19.451
can say, well, what are the philosophical ideas that

935
00:49:19.461 --> 00:49:21.642
are at stake here? How can we bring those

936
00:49:21.652 --> 00:49:24.592
into dialogue? Can we find a synthesis between them

937
00:49:24.602 --> 00:49:28.031
or ultimately, is there gonna be some irresolvable incompatibility

938
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:30.902
between particular ideas? And that's what I do in

939
00:49:30.912 --> 00:49:33.741
my own work. I think, I think of myself

940
00:49:33.751 --> 00:49:35.731
as a philosopher who does science and religion and

941
00:49:35.862 --> 00:49:39.162
philosophy in my view is the perfect tool in

942
00:49:39.172 --> 00:49:41.892
order to bring these fascinating disciplines into dialogue.

943
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.899
So I I know that you, you'll also have

944
00:49:45.909 --> 00:49:48.929
a new book coming out later this year in

945
00:49:48.939 --> 00:49:52.000
August. If I'm not mistaken, salvation in the block

946
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.780
universe. So would you like to give us perhaps

947
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:55.629
a teaser?

948
00:49:56.989 --> 00:49:59.780
Yeah. So salvation in the block universe actually explores

949
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.350
a lot of the themes that we've been discussing

950
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.949
today. So my Cambridge element, God salvation and the

951
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:06.850
problem of space time is a general introduction to

952
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:10.120
these ideas. I set out uh the history of

953
00:50:10.129 --> 00:50:12.129
the philosophy of time. I talk about the physics

954
00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:14.689
of space time and then how God and time

955
00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.830
interact and also how salvation can be influenced by

956
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.379
our understanding of space time. What salvation in the

957
00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:26.379
block universe does is takes the block universe understanding

958
00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:29.419
of spatial temporal reality and says, what does this

959
00:50:29.429 --> 00:50:32.330
mean for personal salvation? So it's a much more

960
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.810
in depth exploration of the problem of salvation in

961
00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.179
the B block universe. So I, I do talk

962
00:50:38.189 --> 00:50:41.840
about some of the ideas in my but God

963
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.530
salvation and the problem of space this time. But

964
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.860
in salvation of the block universe, I'm really going

965
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.739
to a lot more detail and I use uh

966
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.389
Paul Tillich 20th century theologian as a dialogue partner

967
00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:57.110
there. And Tli has this brilliant theological methodology that

968
00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.070
he calls the method of correlation. And that's the

969
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.629
method that I use in my book. So the

970
00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:03.810
method of correlation says that theology only works when

971
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.360
it's in dialogue with culture. So what theologians need

972
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.370
to do is look at culture, look at the

973
00:51:08.379 --> 00:51:11.000
contemporary culture that they're in and say what are

974
00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:13.459
the important questions that are arising out of this

975
00:51:13.469 --> 00:51:17.760
culture ferilli, these were existential questions. And so his

976
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.000
theology is very deeply informed by existentialism. But for

977
00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:24.540
me, I was looking um at at philosophy particularly

978
00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:27.030
and seeing that questions about time, temporal reality and

979
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.580
space time are some of the pressing conceptual questions

980
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.899
that we are dealing with. And so I begin

981
00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.629
with the physics and philosophy of space time and

982
00:51:36.639 --> 00:51:39.044
the block univer. And then I go on to

983
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:42.665
talk about the implications for salvation. So anyone who's

984
00:51:42.675 --> 00:51:45.645
interested in the book that we've been discussing today

985
00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:48.725
will hopefully find the book that I'm releasing in

986
00:51:48.735 --> 00:51:52.125
August. Similarly interesting. It goes, it's a deeper dive

987
00:51:52.135 --> 00:51:53.885
into some of these questions.

988
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.419
So, and of course, I'm leaving a link to

989
00:51:57.429 --> 00:52:00.800
the book we've been discussing today God salvation and

990
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:03.620
the problem of space time in the description of

991
00:52:03.629 --> 00:52:06.100
the interview. And would you also like to tell

992
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.459
people where they can find you and the rest

993
00:52:08.469 --> 00:52:10.179
of your work on the internet?

994
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.620
Yeah, that's right. So, um I have a Twitter,

995
00:52:13.679 --> 00:52:17.459
it's E Qureshi Hurst and I tweet about all

996
00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:21.189
things science, philosophy, theology, and also a bit about

997
00:52:21.199 --> 00:52:24.080
my life as well. Um I have a Google

998
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:26.500
Scholar page where you can find all of my

999
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.610
papers. So you just type in my name, Emily

1000
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.350
Qureshi Hurson to Google my Google scholar page will

1001
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.550
be there. Uh Quite a few of my papers

1002
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.639
are open access so they can be read by

1003
00:52:35.649 --> 00:52:40.010
anybody. And um yeah, I, I hope that people

1004
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.610
will be interested in these ideas and explore them

1005
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.010
further.

1006
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:48.050
Great. So Doctor Kihi Hurst, thank you so much
