00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.920
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:09.739
today I'm joined by Dr Mia Massimi. She is

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.250
Professor of Philosophy of Science in the Department of

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.770
Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, affiliated with the

6
00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.379
Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics. She works in the

7
00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.075
area of history and Philosophy of Science with the

8
00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.815
focus on the physical sciences. And today we are

9
00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:30.215
focusing on her book Perspective of Realism, which by

10
00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:34.744
the way, just recently won the 2023 Lacas awards.

11
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.994
So Dr Massimi, welcome to the show. It's a

12
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.404
big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:42.345
Thank you so much for having me Ricardo to

14
00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:42.845
be here.

15
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.479
OK. So to get into the book, I would

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.900
like to start by asking you this. So what

17
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.779
is realism in science? And by the way, uh

18
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.720
when, when I mean, realism is, are there different

19
00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.319
kinds of realism or not?

20
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.349
Sure. Yeah. So um what we call realism in

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.589
philosophy of science is really um a broad um

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.870
family of views um that normally are characterized by

23
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:21.080
um series of commitments um that um are distinctive

24
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.610
of what we would like to think of a

25
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.000
realist position. Now, uh what those commitments are obviously

26
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.339
um are fairly well understood, but also change in

27
00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.580
a very subtle way depending on which specific variety

28
00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:41.709
of realism one is willing to subscribe to. Um

29
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.980
So I would say that what defines realism are

30
00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.120
two main commitments. Uh One is the idea that

31
00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:54.889
there is uh uh uh uh some relationship between

32
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.940
science and um nature that is usually captured by

33
00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:03.879
the notion of truth. Um And the other is

34
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.410
that there has to be some kind of representational

35
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:11.110
relation between how science and scientific theory, scientific models

36
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.789
relate to the target system. So if you ask

37
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.899
me, I would say um realism is defined by

38
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.149
those two broad notions of truth and representation. Now,

39
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.289
obviously, we may disagree about what we mean by

40
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.130
truth. We may disagree slightly about what we mean

41
00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.619
by representation, how models represent reality. Um So, depending

42
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.449
on how different philosophers characterize those notions, you may

43
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.190
get different varieties of realism. Um So, over really

44
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.160
the past uh 40 50 years, there has been

45
00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.179
a proliferation of views that call themselves or style

46
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.630
themselves as realist view. Um Some of them are

47
00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.500
um redefining some of those notions of truth. So

48
00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:01.619
you have variety of pragmatic realism or internal realism.

49
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.350
Um Others are rethinking the exact nature of the

50
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.330
relationship between science and nature um uh in terms

51
00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.630
of representation. So you have varieties of selective realism,

52
00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.839
for example, that um endorse the presentational commitment, but

53
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.039
they would be selective about which aspects of reality

54
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:28.460
the model is committed to represent. So very broadly,

55
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.100
truth and representation are the two key commitments. Uh

56
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.600
And within the broad umbrella, there is a, a

57
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.039
full spectrum of views that may slightly differ in

58
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.580
how they understand those two notions and how those

59
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.600
two notions enter into um our way of thinking

60
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.869
about science and, and reality

61
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.000
and related to that, what would an anti realist

62
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.660
stance in science entail?

63
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.229
So, um going back to this idea that, you

64
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.750
know, truth and representations are some of the two

65
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:12.600
key commitments. Um uh ANTI realist view views and

66
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.660
plural can be characterized by uh playing down some

67
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.820
of those um notions. So for example, you find

68
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.739
the varieties of instrumentalist views, they are anti realist

69
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.570
views because they are not committed to the notion

70
00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:32.600
that um uh truth is any important element in

71
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:34.570
the way in which we think about the relation

72
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:39.279
between science and reality. Um You get varieties of

73
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.640
constructivism um that likewise uh would challenge the idea

74
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.489
that uh representation really plays an important role in

75
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.100
how models latch onto, onto the world on the

76
00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:56.929
realities. Um So there's a broad spectrum of views

77
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.170
really going back to um 1980 the scientific image

78
00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:04.589
of Basman Pras. And um that has been a

79
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.619
landmark book for a constructive empiricism. Um It's a

80
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.290
classic example of an anterial view where um the

81
00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:15.390
notion of truth is replaced by notion of empirical

82
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.730
adequacy, for example. So according to a fra and

83
00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:22.519
die of science is not to deliver um theories,

84
00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.359
they are approximately true but to deliver theories, they

85
00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.899
are pi adequate. Um TWO more recently varieties of

86
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.809
epistemological constructivism. So, um Mike Boone um building on

87
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.670
the process and defense form a form of constructivism

88
00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:45.829
and um how she conceptualizes the relationship between models

89
00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.029
and reality. Um So this is just an example,

90
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.890
but obviously the family is much broader than that.

91
00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.959
And what is a scientific perspective?

92
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.809
Um So it's a great question, what is STV

93
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.320
perspective? So the term um has a bit of

94
00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:08.040
an history. Um The way I've been using it

95
00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:11.029
in my book um really has a um a

96
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.440
predecessor. The closest predecessor is in Ron's uh book

97
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.290
on scientific perspective is uh the way Ron Giri

98
00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:24.000
originally defined the notion of a scientific perspective was

99
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.500
really in analogy uh with Thomas Coon's notion of

100
00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:33.899
a disciplinary matrix. So disciplinary matrix is a um

101
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:36.790
a slightly more refined notion of uh probably the

102
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:41.109
more familiar notion of S and TV paradigm um

103
00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:45.190
in the sense that it indicates uh a family

104
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.890
of um practices and commitments that particular community has

105
00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:53.049
at a particular historical time. The way in which

106
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.850
Rangiri originally defined the Oslo scientific perspective in, in,

107
00:06:56.859 --> 00:07:00.399
in the book was really in terms of families

108
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.399
or models. So Rangiri was building on a long

109
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.570
standing tradition, going back to Patrick Sap in the

110
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:11.299
19 sixties onwards, um whereby uh we need to

111
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.609
think of scientific theories as, as families or models.

112
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:19.000
Uh STARTING with high level models, uh representational models,

113
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.140
going all the way down to um models of

114
00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:25.609
the experiment, data model and so forth. What I

115
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.859
do in the book is to slightly move away

116
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:32.899
from Maroni's definition. Um Because I would like to

117
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.739
think of a scientific perspective as something broader than

118
00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:39.790
just the family of models. So for me, a

119
00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:45.140
scientific perspective is the historically and culturally situated practice

120
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:49.670
of particular communities, a particular historical time. And I

121
00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:51.880
understand really this notion of practice in a very,

122
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.700
very broad sense um um to include varieties of

123
00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:01.799
knowledge that um may not necessarily have well defined

124
00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:08.570
formalized modeling practices. Um So broadly speaking, a scientific

125
00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:11.750
perspective is a, is a historically situated practice of

126
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.179
a community. And um here I borrow on the

127
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.559
literature in epistemology. Um THERE'S been again, a very

128
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.920
important literature on perspective is coming from epistemology and

129
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:28.079
Aaron Sosa in particular knowledge in perspective uh book

130
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:31.160
uh from which I'm drawing in thinking that really

131
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.320
what SN TV perspective does is not just to

132
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.229
um advance um a series of claims of knowledge,

133
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.820
but also provide the um experimental theoretical and technological

134
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.159
tools for reliably making those claims of knowledge as

135
00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:55.619
well as providing um methodological and epistemic principles that

136
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.830
can justify the reliability of um of our uh

137
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.510
uh uh uh practices for making those claims of

138
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.260
knowledge. So it's kind of a a three fold

139
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.909
distinction between the body of claims of knowledge, the

140
00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:16.030
experimental theoretical conceptual tools to reliably make them and

141
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.780
the methodological epistemic principle that justify the reliability of

142
00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:23.000
those uh of those tools. And that's the, the,

143
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.010
the very broad way in which I've been using

144
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.599
the term in the book.

145
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:32.289
And what about a perspective of realism? What does

146
00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:37.380
it mean exactly? And what flavor of realism applies

147
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.750
to it?

148
00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:41.460
So, um yeah, that's a great question. Going back

149
00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:44.330
to the original question about varieties of realism and

150
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.400
family of realism. Um I'd like to think of

151
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:51.960
prospect our realism as a view that is committed

152
00:09:51.969 --> 00:09:55.539
to the notion of truth as correspondence and the

153
00:09:55.549 --> 00:10:00.510
idea that um our theories, our models especially uh

154
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.799
represent reality. So it's a realist view. But the

155
00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:07.200
way I present the view in the book is

156
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.520
that it, it's not a metaphysics first uh view

157
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.859
about realism. So very often what you find is

158
00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:19.320
that realism is defined by uh metaphysics first approaches.

159
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.799
So if someone declared themselves a realist, what they

160
00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.359
really mean is that they are committed to spelling

161
00:10:26.369 --> 00:10:29.869
out to what the metaphysical building blocks of nature

162
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.789
are or they are committed to um tell a

163
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:37.460
story about uh what the metaphysical foundations of reality

164
00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:42.380
are. And the metaphysical story typically involves um different

165
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:46.250
flavors of metaphysics. So some people are committed to

166
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.320
natural properties others are committed to the there are

167
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.719
dispositions um or other people believe in causal powers.

168
00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.289
Um PER the realism is not a metaphysics first

169
00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:03.479
approach in the sense that although there is a

170
00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:06.530
metaphysical part, uh which is the second part of

171
00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:10.159
the book, um the primary aim is really um

172
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.270
trying to uh uh in a way show how

173
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.239
that metaphysical commitment is really downstream to an epistemological

174
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.849
project. So what really matters to me is to

175
00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:27.580
trying to understand how we produce reliable knowledge over

176
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.690
time and how a plurality of historical and cultural

177
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.520
situated perspectives um are able to uh deliver that

178
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.719
reliable knowledge over time. So um I see realism

179
00:11:41.729 --> 00:11:45.690
not so much as uh um an exercise in

180
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.940
trying to uh unveil the metaphysical building block of

181
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.539
nature, but I see metaphysics as the downstream outcome

182
00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:57.590
of how we tell a story about how we

183
00:11:57.599 --> 00:12:01.109
produce reliable knowledge over time. So there is a

184
00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:04.340
metaphysical part. So ultimately, spec of realism is realism

185
00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:08.559
about phenomena about modally robust phenomenon. And that obviously

186
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.929
involves really finding the very notion of phenomena that

187
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.049
has a long philosophical history. And it's, it's, it's

188
00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:17.010
part of what they're doing in the second part

189
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.330
of the book. So if you ask me, what

190
00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.820
kind of flavor is perspective, a realism, it's really

191
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.479
realism about moderate robust phenomena. Um But as I

192
00:12:26.489 --> 00:12:30.059
said, I see that metaphysical commitment as, as the

193
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.679
outcome of uh um uh a more important exercise,

194
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.979
which is trying to understand how um different communities

195
00:12:38.989 --> 00:12:42.869
over time and culture produce reliable knowledge over time.

196
00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:48.229
But then where is, where exactly is the perspective,

197
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:51.330
all nature in scientific representation?

198
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:54.919
So, yeah, what that perspective is enters into the

199
00:12:54.929 --> 00:12:58.169
story of how we produce reliable knowledge, right? So

200
00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:02.369
um I can think of a plurality of communities

201
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.669
that are historical and cultural situated, different historical periods,

202
00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:09.219
different cultures and so forth. Can we tell a

203
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:14.119
story about how that knowledge is produced a across

204
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.630
these different communities? And how is that story going

205
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.409
to look like? Um So one thing I definitely

206
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:22.880
wanted to do in the book is to avoid

207
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.510
any um standard template that you find in the

208
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.859
literature on realism about realism of being some kind

209
00:13:29.869 --> 00:13:34.030
of convergence to a reality that um in a

210
00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:38.090
way we all agree upon. Um There is no

211
00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:41.280
convergence in perspective of realism. Um The way I

212
00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.119
use often this metaphor in the book taken for

213
00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:49.159
um the, the o Borges at the Garden of

214
00:13:49.169 --> 00:13:53.119
Forking Path, they are uh producing knowledge is a

215
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.890
bit like going through a garden of forking path

216
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.969
and kind of zigzagging where at each juncture, we

217
00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:00.780
have to make a choice about which path we

218
00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:03.280
want to go down. So there is no uh

219
00:14:03.289 --> 00:14:06.440
or underlying picture, the realism is a convergence to

220
00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.609
because really it's a realism about phenomena, there's no

221
00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:13.739
realism about any fundamental metaphysical reality, as I said,

222
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.299
the cause of powers, dispositional essence is that we

223
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:20.059
want to call it. Um So those phenomena are

224
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.229
encountered by different communities across different periods and across

225
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.849
different cultures um in a reliable way or in

226
00:14:27.859 --> 00:14:29.919
a way that we are able to uh uh

227
00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:33.950
to see how their situated practices intersect with one

228
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.659
another. So this is where the perspective that comes

229
00:14:36.669 --> 00:14:41.650
in, right? Because traditionally, um the very idea that

230
00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:48.090
the starting point of conversations about realism um is,

231
00:14:48.099 --> 00:14:51.799
is, is, is is human beings in their plurality

232
00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:56.010
and historically and cultural situated, this has appeared to

233
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.760
be a stumbling block to any realist project. How

234
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.239
could one ever possibly defend realism, especially about science?

235
00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:08.020
Once we take really seriously that there is a

236
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.359
plurality of um historically situated communities and their culture.

237
00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:15.559
So that was the starting point of my um

238
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.070
kind of journey uh for the book. Um I

239
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.309
went back to the notion of representation. I said

240
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.909
at the beginning through the representations are the two

241
00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:28.059
key commitment of any realist view. And I wanted

242
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.229
to understand what makes some representations pers respectable and

243
00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:35.700
whether there is a way of reconciling the perspective

244
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.799
of representation with realism. Um So at the very

245
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:41.659
beginning of the book, I go back to the

246
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:45.359
analogy between art and science and that has been

247
00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:48.109
well explored since the time of, well, it's a

248
00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:51.570
long story, long tradition really. Uh BUT more recently,

249
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.429
Basra and 2008 book on a scientific representation, paradoxes

250
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.799
of perspectives has been a very influential uh book

251
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:02.979
for uh for my own personal journey, but also

252
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:07.630
Kathrine Elgin uh 2017 book. Uh True Enough, uh

253
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.700
is also very important for discussing the perspective nature

254
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.849
of representation. And so really thinking about the analogy

255
00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:18.299
between art and science, what makes some representation perspect?

256
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.049
Traditionally, we tend to think of that uh question

257
00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:27.400
in terms of the representation is situated is from

258
00:16:27.409 --> 00:16:30.989
a particular vantage point. So um a drawing, a

259
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.200
perspective drawing is what makes the drawing perspective is

260
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.869
that the scene is painted from a particular angle.

261
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:42.270
And obviously, the angle means that there are other

262
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.460
aspects of the scene that we can't really see

263
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:47.320
uh from that particular angle. So there is an

264
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.849
element of lusion and there is what Vansen called

265
00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:55.669
um a horizon of alternatives. We could have chosen

266
00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:58.469
to represent the scene from different angles and we

267
00:16:58.479 --> 00:17:02.000
could have chosen to represent the object with different

268
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:08.048
attributes. Um So the story I turn in chapter

269
00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:09.638
two and three of the book, which is really

270
00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:12.249
the beginning of the of the book is that

271
00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:15.749
very often that specific way of thinking about perspective

272
00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:23.050
of representation um has been um regarded as a

273
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.130
as a, as a difficulty for any realism or

274
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.889
a realist project. Um Precisely because if the representation

275
00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:33.499
is situated is from a particular angle, how can

276
00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:35.598
we ever be in a position of saying what

277
00:17:35.609 --> 00:17:39.029
the real nature of the object is, our knowledge

278
00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:42.649
is always partially occluded and, and, and, and not

279
00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:46.280
complete. Um So the story I tell is that,

280
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.979
well, actually, if you look at the nature of

281
00:17:48.989 --> 00:17:51.479
perspective and drawing in art, um there are two

282
00:17:51.489 --> 00:17:55.280
ways of thinking about perspective, um a representation is

283
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.819
perspective, not only because it's drawn from a particular

284
00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:01.550
angle, but because it's also drawn towards one or

285
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.189
more vantage point. Actually, technically, this is the definition

286
00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:09.650
of a perspect uh representation that um there is

287
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.050
one or more vantage point towards which lines converge.

288
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.609
And that's what creates the optical illusion that you

289
00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:19.369
can see a three dimensional space on what effectively

290
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.689
is a two dimensional canvas. Um And, and so

291
00:18:23.699 --> 00:18:25.890
I play with that metaphor in art to say,

292
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.810
well, really, those are two aspects of the same

293
00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:30.880
coin really, you know, you the representation is perspect

294
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.099
as drawn from a particular vantage point only in

295
00:18:34.109 --> 00:18:36.150
so far as there is one or more vantage

296
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.349
points that allows us to create this, this these

297
00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:43.680
windows of reality, uh this, this three dimensional space

298
00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:46.670
emerging out of a two dimensional canvas. And so

299
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.650
that's my entry point for the idea that there

300
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.760
is a way of telling a story about realism

301
00:18:51.989 --> 00:18:54.959
starting with the situated nature of the representation.

302
00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.079
So tell us now about the notion of pluralism.

303
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.280
Where is it and how does it apply to

304
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.069
science?

305
00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:08.400
Yeah. So pluralism is really uh again, a big

306
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.760
family of views. Uh I'm drawing really here on

307
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.349
a long standing tradition that has emphasized the importance

308
00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:22.359
of pluralism in science. Um EXPLANATORY pluralism and methodological

309
00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:27.530
pluralism uh tradition. Going back to Ellen Longino and

310
00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:31.229
uh Carol, a fair and Miriam Solomon and Sandra

311
00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:36.260
Mitchell, integrity, pluralism. Obviously, John Dupre promiscuous realism and

312
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.420
many, many, many others. Um THE kind of pluralism

313
00:19:40.589 --> 00:19:44.729
um that matters to my story is again, perspect

314
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.010
about pluralism is pluralism of perspectives as I have

315
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.260
defined it. Uh So my emphasis is not so

316
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:56.150
much on um explanatory methodological or ontological pluralism. It's

317
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.750
really pluralism about uh uh historically, cult is the

318
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.719
practices. It's, it's a fact that science is the

319
00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:09.119
outcome of this plurality of perspectives and communities that

320
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.209
have endorsed different practices. Um And then obviously, then

321
00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:16.800
the question becomes OK. Um As I was just

322
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.430
saying with the problem of perspective or representation is

323
00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:24.229
pers sorry, representation from a point of view, representation

324
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.729
uh uh towards one or more vantage point, the

325
00:20:28.739 --> 00:20:31.489
question is OK, if you take the pluralism as

326
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.819
a fact about science, what kind of uh realism

327
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.530
emerges out of that, can we even talk about

328
00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.500
realism or should we just say that we are

329
00:20:43.949 --> 00:20:49.329
um confined to a plurality of um ways of

330
00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:52.439
knowing they are distinctive of different communities and their

331
00:20:52.449 --> 00:20:57.250
practices? Um But we can't really attempt to tell

332
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.619
a story about science and scientific knowledge and, and

333
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.109
realism about science and the best that we can

334
00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:07.719
do is this plurality of scientific practices. So, what

335
00:21:07.729 --> 00:21:08.800
I do in the book is to say, no,

336
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.979
no, no. We, we can take the pluralism, perspect

337
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.619
of pluralism as a starting point. It's a fact

338
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.050
about science. The science is produced in that way.

339
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.859
But that doesn't mean that we need to end

340
00:21:21.869 --> 00:21:25.239
up with some kind of instrumentalist or anti realist

341
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.290
view. There's still a way of defending realism in

342
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.739
science. Um STARTING with perspect about pluralism.

343
00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:37.750
Mhm And so another thing that you tackle in

344
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.510
your book is the problem of inconsistent model. So

345
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.290
what is that problem really about and can perspective

346
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.109
is help us tackle it?

347
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.430
Yeah. So kind of zooming into uh this problem

348
00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:56.390
of how to reconcile um Perspect about pluralism as

349
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.790
pluralism of perspectives and, and realism. The problem in

350
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.849
consistent models uh is, is, is one of, is

351
00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:07.650
one of the major problem for any perspective is

352
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:13.439
um because this is where we the pluralism um

353
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.250
appears to be somehow at odds with any realist

354
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.579
claim. Um So it's a problem that was really

355
00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:25.709
brought to the general attention um maybe 13 years

356
00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:30.449
ago uh roughly uh by uh Mary Morrison um

357
00:22:30.459 --> 00:22:34.270
in a, in a beautiful paper where she discusses

358
00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.969
the plurality of models in some areas of science.

359
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:40.229
So she says, well, look at nuclear physics, right?

360
00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:42.390
Um So the areas of science where there is

361
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.180
one model, we all agree more or less that

362
00:22:45.189 --> 00:22:48.439
uh you know, it is the um best model

363
00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:50.599
to describe some kind of phenomena. But there are

364
00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:52.819
other areas where there seems to be a pluralism,

365
00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:56.239
a kind of endemic pluralism and as, as pluralism

366
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.180
of models. So the example of Morrison is that

367
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.650
if you look at nuclear physics, and if you

368
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.560
ask the question about what is the atomic nucleus,

369
00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:09.170
um you find different answers to the question depending

370
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.650
on whether we are studying a nuclear fission. In

371
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.160
which case, we represent the nucleus as if it

372
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.589
was a liquid of incompressible nuclear fluid. Uh But

373
00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:23.540
if we are studying um stellar nucleus synthesis, we

374
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.030
use different families of models, the cluster model whereby

375
00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:31.160
the atomic nucleus is represented as a tetrahedron with

376
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.079
a particular structures of problems and neutrons. And obviously,

377
00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:38.630
if we're studying other phenomena in high energy physics,

378
00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:41.640
we use yet another class of models. We use

379
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.630
the quark models to describe what happens when we

380
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.359
smash protons to say at LHC. So Morrison Point

381
00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:51.449
was, well, if we have this pluralism of models,

382
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.229
does it even make sense to ask what is

383
00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:57.300
the atomic nucleus? I mean, w where is the

384
00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.079
realism there? Right? I mean, we have different stories

385
00:24:00.089 --> 00:24:02.979
about what the nucleus is. Um IS there one

386
00:24:02.989 --> 00:24:05.770
which is the best one? And if, if there

387
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.319
is, then what about the others? Isn't it better

388
00:24:08.329 --> 00:24:14.219
to adopt some kind of instrumental is um perspective

389
00:24:14.229 --> 00:24:18.270
is, has often been accused of being a form

390
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.939
of instrumental is so um Morrison uh argument in

391
00:24:22.949 --> 00:24:26.969
that paper that has also been rested by other

392
00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:31.449
philosophers like an Chakravorti, for example, in um in,

393
00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:34.670
in, in, in, in his book on um the

394
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.540
the kind of metaphysics of nature is that very

395
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.449
often perspective is, doesn't live up to the promise

396
00:24:40.459 --> 00:24:44.310
of realism because it looks like uh what we

397
00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:47.609
really mean by perspective is is the representation is

398
00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.500
drawn from a particular point of view. So if

399
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.010
you look at the nucleus from the point of

400
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.329
view of um fission, then it looks like a

401
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.030
liquid drop. But if you look at the nucleus

402
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.280
from the point of view of stellar nucleus synthesis,

403
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.109
then it looks like a tetrad. And I think

404
00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:05.569
it's that way of thinking about perspective is that

405
00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:09.319
has really um meant that perspective is for a

406
00:25:09.329 --> 00:25:11.930
long time as has been regarded as kind of

407
00:25:11.939 --> 00:25:15.579
no much for realism. Um So I tackled the

408
00:25:15.589 --> 00:25:17.949
problem of inconsistent models in chapter three of the

409
00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:21.040
book. And um I show that the problem is

410
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.780
not really a problem for perspective is in so

411
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.739
far as we are clear about um some hidden

412
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.250
assumptions that seems to be creeping into the argument.

413
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.160
And so some of those assumptions are uh in

414
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.469
my view are, are really um kind of very

415
00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:44.349
demanding and unduly stringent realist assumption that seems to

416
00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:48.069
assume that models represent by mapping 1 to 1

417
00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:50.260
aspects of the model with aspects of the target

418
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.050
system. And that seems to understand the notion of

419
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.810
truth going back to representation of truth in terms

420
00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:00.770
of uh truth maker. So there has to be

421
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.780
a ontological state of affairs in terms of ascription

422
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.709
of essential properties to particular that make some claims

423
00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:11.099
of knowledge true. And now if one endorses that

424
00:26:11.109 --> 00:26:14.219
view about truth, the truth makers and representation as

425
00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:18.800
mapping, I think Morrison has a point that this

426
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.160
plurality of model seems to be a problem for,

427
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.790
for realism, we can't think of the nucleus as

428
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.770
having inconsistent or incompatible essential properties. Um But what

429
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.219
I do in chapter three of the book is

430
00:26:31.229 --> 00:26:36.069
to resist that assumption and saying, uh why, why

431
00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.780
do we need to buy into representation as mapping

432
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.689
or what do we need to buy into truth

433
00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.849
as truth maker? Maybe there is a different way

434
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:46.290
of thinking about what models do and how they

435
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.829
represent from a perspective or point of view that

436
00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:53.760
doesn't necessarily land us into this um uh quo

437
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.500
of inconsistent essential properties ascribed to the same target

438
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.420
system. And so it's a very important problem because

439
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.060
it's really um the starting point of a way

440
00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:08.239
of reconciling realism or perspective is

441
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.479
and uh related to perspective modeling and perspective of

442
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.420
models. Um What do you mean by them being

443
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.300
blueprints on reality as you say in the book?

444
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.260
And uh perhaps related to these, how do the

445
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.339
concepts of conceivability and possibility enter into it.

446
00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:38.250
Yeah. So um what I do from chapter four

447
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.560
or five onwards is to spell out the positive

448
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.750
story, right? And not just to say, we need

449
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.660
to resist all this assumption and duly stringent assumption.

450
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.500
So um a different way of thinking about what

451
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.380
models do is to tell a different story about

452
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.810
how to represent their target system without ascribing essential

453
00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:59.280
properties to the target system. So in that context

454
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.300
that develop the view that models really are inferential

455
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.719
blueprints, so they are blueprints that allows different communities.

456
00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:10.239
And again, think of a plurality of historical and

457
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:16.420
cultural situated communities to draw inferences about relevant model,

458
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.609
robust phenomena from a plurality of data set. So

459
00:28:20.619 --> 00:28:24.920
what the model does is not so much mapping

460
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.829
1 to 1 aspects of the model and aspects

461
00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:30.109
of reality. I think we have been very often

462
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.540
in philosophy, science, we have this picture that models

463
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.150
represent. But as if really the primary function of

464
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.719
the model was to mirror a map onto the

465
00:28:39.729 --> 00:28:43.869
target system, right? But that idea seems very counterintuitive

466
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.709
to me even I mean, think of well established

467
00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:48.380
model like the DN model of the nucleus, right.

468
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.449
I mean, we don't, we don't use the model

469
00:28:51.459 --> 00:28:54.839
because we want to necessarily represent the nucleus, we

470
00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:57.469
use the model because we want to make inferences

471
00:28:57.479 --> 00:28:59.859
right about the that we want to study, we

472
00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:02.760
want to understand how DNA behaves, we want to

473
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.099
understand how uh possible error in the um in

474
00:29:07.109 --> 00:29:11.949
the in the process of DNA uh uh chain

475
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:14.880
of events may happen. So we, we want to

476
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.050
ask those questions about what is possible about DNA

477
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.569
replication and mistakes in the DNA replication. So think

478
00:29:23.579 --> 00:29:26.939
of models really as catering to this needs of

479
00:29:26.949 --> 00:29:30.599
allowing us to make uh uh relevant and appropriate

480
00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:33.790
inferences about phenomena that we want to study. So

481
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.339
that's what the metaphor of inferential blueprint is. So

482
00:29:37.349 --> 00:29:39.739
models yes, do represent and do represent from a

483
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.819
specific vantage point. That's why we have a plurality

484
00:29:42.829 --> 00:29:46.010
of models used by different communities. The primary function

485
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.750
is not to ascribe essential properties to the target

486
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.469
system. As the metaphysicians would like us to think

487
00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:54.040
of the primary function is to allow communities to

488
00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:59.680
make reliable, robust, relevant and appropriate inferences about those

489
00:29:59.689 --> 00:30:01.589
uh uh those phenomena that, that, that we want

490
00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:04.469
to study. And so again, I use the analogy

491
00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:07.000
very often as I do in the book between

492
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.219
um uh uh uh perspective of representation in this

493
00:30:11.229 --> 00:30:13.380
case in architecture. So the idea of the inferential

494
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.160
blueprints is borrowed from, from architecture because again, in,

495
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.910
in, in, in architecture, you can have uh um

496
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.060
a plurality of perspective or representation of say a

497
00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:27.319
house that allows different communities of the carpenter and

498
00:30:27.329 --> 00:30:30.520
the masons and the architects to work together and

499
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.119
make inferences about how the house should be built.

500
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.660
How tall should the roof be? What's the relationship

501
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.280
between the height of the door and the height

502
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.920
of the roof. Uh And so I use an

503
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.869
analogy to say likewise, whenever we want to study

504
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.099
specific phenomenon, that plurality of models allows these different

505
00:30:50.109 --> 00:30:53.800
communities to make those uh uh relevant and appropriate

506
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.660
inferences about the objects so that we want to

507
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:01.050
study. Um So they find in models as really

508
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.319
catering to um the need of delivering knowledge about

509
00:31:05.329 --> 00:31:08.930
what is possible about the object under study. So,

510
00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:13.609
perspect modeling is modeling possibilities, modeling, how things could

511
00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:17.339
be. Um And it's, it's a way of answering

512
00:31:17.349 --> 00:31:19.979
those questions in a kind of very exploratory way

513
00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:22.989
where we have not just one community that can

514
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.339
reclaim full ownership of the knowledge of the target

515
00:31:26.349 --> 00:31:30.540
system, but we need a plurality of communities that

516
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.849
I illustrate with various case studies in the book.

517
00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:35.510
So I have one chapter on climate change. So

518
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.650
climate modeling in the context of studying um uh

519
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:44.729
global warming, one chapter on developmental psychology and one

520
00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:47.569
chapter on the nuclear physics where I show how

521
00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:50.550
in each case to study specific phenomena like the

522
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.589
stability of some nuclear or difficulties with reading or

523
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.319
global warming. We need a plurality of community. So

524
00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:01.869
if you want to study climate change and global

525
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.479
warming, you need a plurality of people that model

526
00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:11.810
um increase in ocean heat temperature uh communities that

527
00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:16.479
model how glacier and permafrost are changing under the

528
00:32:16.489 --> 00:32:20.800
effect of greenhouse gasses. Communities that study corals and

529
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.459
uh uh tree rings. So then thema again to

530
00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:27.020
make inferences from those data to the phenomena under

531
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.920
study. And so it's through that plurality of modeling

532
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.479
practices and, and communities that we come to know

533
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:40.140
very complex and multifactorial phenomena like um global warming,

534
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.770
for example. So that that's how I use the

535
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.969
analogy with models as inferential blueprint to explain our

536
00:32:45.979 --> 00:32:49.500
models. Yes, represent, yes, represent from a perspect point

537
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.979
of view. But they do so by effectively delivering

538
00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:55.790
knowledge about what is possible concerning the object that

539
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.930
we want to study.

540
00:32:57.969 --> 00:33:02.089
So earlier in our conversation, you alluded to this.

541
00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:07.270
Uh But what are they, what are phenomena and

542
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.939
what is the relationship between them through this framework

543
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:14.189
of perspective of realism?

544
00:33:15.489 --> 00:33:19.859
Yeah. So um going back to uh exactly the

545
00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:22.219
question of what flavor of realism is basically our

546
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.400
realism, as I mentioned in the beginning, it's really

547
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.229
a realism about phenomena. But I, one of the

548
00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.939
main task of the book was to redefine what

549
00:33:30.949 --> 00:33:33.540
I mean by phenomenon. This phenomena come from a

550
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.910
long standing empi traditions that really stretches back to,

551
00:33:39.949 --> 00:33:43.849
you know, pm 19 05, a wonderful book on

552
00:33:43.859 --> 00:33:45.979
to save the phenomenon more recently, wasn't to Pras

553
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:49.599
and I mentioned already in 1980 scientific image. Um

554
00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:52.280
THAT also defends the view that um you know,

555
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.760
the reality is reality made of phenomena observable phenomena

556
00:33:55.770 --> 00:34:00.020
according to Tora. Um So it's very difficult to

557
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.569
say that I'm a realist about phenomena when the

558
00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:06.910
very term phenomenon has been associated with uh a

559
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.949
long standing and pis tradition that is normally regarded

560
00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:15.010
phenomena is not the sort of objects that one

561
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.590
would have real and commitment to. Um So what

562
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.330
I do in the second part of the book

563
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.810
is trying to um articulate the positive story and

564
00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.958
the positive story is that um given this perspect

565
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.159
of pluralism, uh where models are embedded as part

566
00:34:33.168 --> 00:34:37.688
of the practices of different communities, the inferences that

567
00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.228
we make are inferences to what I call moly

568
00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:45.120
robust phenomena. So what are moly robust phenomena? They're

569
00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:46.949
not the phenomena of the fro and they're not

570
00:34:46.958 --> 00:34:48.510
the phenomenal of Pierre do m they're not the

571
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:55.168
phenomena of the Empire tradition as um faint copies

572
00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.860
or faint images of a reality uh that lies

573
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.239
underneath the phenomenon that we need to discover uh

574
00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:07.080
you know, appealing to the metaphysician tools or whatever

575
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:11.610
dispositional essences or because of powers uh phenomena of

576
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.239
what there is in a way I'm um borrowing

577
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.250
from the country and tradition, the idea that knowledge

578
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.409
is knowledge of phenomena, but those phenomena not in

579
00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:23.810
pieces, phenomena more robust. And what I really mean

580
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.669
by more of robustness is that phenomena stable event.

581
00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:32.520
So there's a kind of 22 tier ontology that

582
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.780
I articulate in chapter six of the book. So

583
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.159
phenomena are stable event index to a particular domain

584
00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:42.659
and they are modally robust across a plurality of

585
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.149
data to phenomena inferences. So there are stable events

586
00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:50.370
in that, that there is a level of reality

587
00:35:50.379 --> 00:35:53.919
that are called stable event where stability is really

588
00:35:53.929 --> 00:35:58.159
synonymous with low likeness for me. So um stable

589
00:35:58.169 --> 00:36:01.070
events are events that are such not because they

590
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.550
are core ones, but because there are low like

591
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.300
dependencies in in the fabric of those events. So

592
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.939
that explain why they are stable. But the phenomenon

593
00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:15.370
is not just a stable event. Uh The phenomenon

594
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.000
is the outcome of an inference made by communities

595
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.530
from data understood broadly as empirical occurrences. So to

596
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.639
give an example that I um given the book,

597
00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:31.889
um it is a stable event that an electric

598
00:36:31.899 --> 00:36:36.270
charge is gonna be affected by an electric or

599
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.800
magnetic field. So there are low like dependencies that

600
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.370
explains how an electric charge is going to be

601
00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:45.989
deflected by an external field, that's a stable event

602
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.080
in nature. But what we called um cathode ray

603
00:36:51.189 --> 00:36:54.409
or the phenomenon of the bending of cathode rays

604
00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:58.100
is the model robust phenomenon that uh was discovered

605
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.810
by JJ Thompson at the end of the 19th

606
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.949
century using a a particular tool that was a

607
00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:10.139
cato tube working in a particular historically cap situated

608
00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:12.969
context. There was the Victorian Cambridge of the end

609
00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:18.570
of the century. Um And, and so the phenomenon

610
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.389
is not a robust because we can infer and

611
00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:27.479
Reiner um the same phenomenon from different kind of

612
00:37:27.489 --> 00:37:32.239
data sets by slightly tweaking the experimental conditions. Uh

613
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.179
And and so forth. So the model of robustness

614
00:37:35.189 --> 00:37:37.600
is some kind of secondary property that is really

615
00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.429
a property of how different communities are able to

616
00:37:40.459 --> 00:37:44.270
robustly infer the same phenomenon from a variety of,

617
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.600
of data. So that's broadly speaking, the kind of

618
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.709
phenomena for so that I I defend in, in

619
00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:53.409
the book

620
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:59.000
and with that in mind, what are natural kinds

621
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.620
and how do we go from phenomena to kinds?

622
00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:08.820
So yeah, Um so, one of the problem I

623
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.139
had when I was writing the book is that

624
00:38:11.149 --> 00:38:14.489
I was obviously committed to defending this phenomenon for

625
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.120
so, but I was also very much aware that

626
00:38:19.129 --> 00:38:22.360
when it comes to realism, um it's not enough

627
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.209
to say that we live in a world where

628
00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:26.919
there are moli robust phenomena, the bending of the

629
00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:30.449
cat race, the decay of the Higgs boson, the

630
00:38:30.459 --> 00:38:33.679
growth of the mycelium echolocation in Beluga. Those are

631
00:38:33.689 --> 00:38:36.149
examples of what I call moli robust phenomena, the

632
00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:39.679
pollination of flowers and so forth that require inferences

633
00:38:39.689 --> 00:38:42.919
on behalf of communities to stable events in nature.

634
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.080
A realist wants uh something more than phenomena. A

635
00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:53.129
realist want something about natural kinds. So a realist

636
00:38:53.139 --> 00:38:56.439
would say, um I don't just want to know

637
00:38:56.449 --> 00:38:58.550
what the bending of cadore is. I want to

638
00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.919
know what the electron is. I want to know

639
00:38:59.929 --> 00:39:02.060
what the nucleus is. I want to know what

640
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.439
genes are. I want to know, you know um

641
00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:08.699
what lemon and zebras and supernovas. Are so those

642
00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:13.469
are natural kinds. So those are uh kinds of

643
00:39:13.479 --> 00:39:17.530
things. And um again, realism very often has been

644
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.840
associated with um number of views about what national

645
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.969
kinds are. Um RANGING from hacking. And no, to

646
00:39:26.979 --> 00:39:31.110
I mentioned already, John Dupre promiscuous realism to varieties

647
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.790
of uh uh um microstructure and essentialism back to

648
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.560
Hillary Patnam in the 19 seventies and so forth.

649
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.669
Um So the story I tell in the book

650
00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:42.909
about natural kinds, which really a long one, it

651
00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:45.310
stands from chapter seven to chapter 10 in the

652
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:51.110
book is that natural kinds are open ended grouping

653
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.179
of historically identified phenomena. There is nothing more, nothing

654
00:39:55.189 --> 00:39:59.350
over uh natural kinds than open ended grouping of

655
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.000
historical identified phenomena. And obviously, the big challenge is

656
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.810
OK, is this just a form of conventional, is

657
00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:08.959
a natural kind, just the label that we attach

658
00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:12.399
to grouping of phenomena. So I had to go

659
00:40:12.409 --> 00:40:15.199
into um quite a lot of details to clarify

660
00:40:15.209 --> 00:40:17.919
why the view is not a conventional view. And

661
00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:21.020
it's not an essentialist view either. Um But it's

662
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.000
really a view that tries to again bring in

663
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:28.280
the inferential is so phenomena, the outcome of inferences

664
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:32.760
likewise natural kinds are the outcome of inferences. Um

665
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:37.760
Rob robust, reliable, still revis still open ended, still

666
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.939
very valuable inferences made by plurality of communities over

667
00:40:41.949 --> 00:40:45.459
time. Um And so I'll give a full definition,

668
00:40:45.469 --> 00:40:49.080
I give a full inferential story uh about national

669
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.139
kind. They are called natural kinds with the human

670
00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:56.979
face. Borrowing from Hillary but 1990 book realism with

671
00:40:56.989 --> 00:41:00.800
a human face. Um What I explain how those

672
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:04.300
law like dependencies in the fabric of the stable

673
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.959
events provide effectively the um I I if you

674
00:41:08.969 --> 00:41:12.360
like the the kind of pointers in this walking

675
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.760
in the garden of working path in whereby communities

676
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.989
can make uh choices about what to cluster or

677
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.040
what not to cluster into the natural kind. But

678
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.120
to do so reliably, they need to rely on

679
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.860
low like dependencies. They are part of the stable

680
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.360
events in nature. So the clustering is not arbitrary,

681
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.570
it is not conventional. And so there is an

682
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.800
element of contingencies, but it's not a rampant kind

683
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.189
of contingentism. It's, it's kind of constrained and guided

684
00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:45.919
by um low like dependencies in nature. So it's

685
00:41:45.929 --> 00:41:49.139
a long story from chapter seven to chapter 10.

686
00:41:49.149 --> 00:41:51.330
And I give a full detail of that in,

687
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.770
in, in, in chapter 10 of the book where

688
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.159
I delve into the historical case studies about the

689
00:41:56.169 --> 00:41:58.860
electron. And yeah, sorry.

690
00:41:59.479 --> 00:42:02.719
No, no, no worries. Uh And another thing I

691
00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:04.479
would like to ask you is at a certain

692
00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:08.810
point in the book, you talk about contingentism. So

693
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.979
what is contingentism and how is it involved in

694
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.060
perspective of realism?

695
00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:20.820
So continent is, is associated precisely with um with

696
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.250
this point I was making about how the um

697
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.600
open ended grouping of phenomena um is to some

698
00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:31.110
extent contingent in the sense that we could have

699
00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.560
cluster different phenomena under the National Kind Electron, for

700
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.540
example, um now continent, this historically has been a

701
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.750
very powerful uh argument coming from the history of

702
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.459
science against a very strong um the physical form

703
00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:52.699
of realism. Um um So, I don't know lots

704
00:42:52.709 --> 00:42:55.399
of people that contributed to this debate from has

705
00:42:55.699 --> 00:42:59.389
Chang to cons for them. Also Joseph Laporte. Um

706
00:42:59.399 --> 00:43:03.330
SO things could have gone otherwise, right? So Joseph

707
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.550
Laporte, in his book on Natural Con and con

708
00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:08.010
change, tell us it is a beautiful story of

709
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.570
how, you know, we made a choice at some

710
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.110
point to include the dirty oxide into um the

711
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.560
natural kind water. But there was a choice in

712
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:19.989
a way that we made, we could have, we

713
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.040
could have gone otherwise. So that's the element of

714
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.620
contingentism. Uh I define a particular brand of contingentism

715
00:43:26.629 --> 00:43:31.379
in the sense that um um um I'm not

716
00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:34.280
that kind of full blown contingent is in the

717
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.419
sense that I don't think that things could have

718
00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:41.149
gone entirely in a completely different way. Uh Precisely

719
00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:44.959
because um the way I think a phenomena as

720
00:43:44.969 --> 00:43:48.110
a stable event where stability is synonymous with low

721
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.360
likeness means that the inferences that communities make about

722
00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:57.790
what phenomena goes with. What other phenomena are not

723
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.300
fully at our discretion, are not fully at our

724
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.510
women in a way we need to respond to

725
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.600
the Tribunal of Nature as a speaker, I find.

726
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.379
So um There are a lot like dependencies that

727
00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:15.189
really guides those inferences that we make. Um So,

728
00:44:15.239 --> 00:44:17.260
uh uh and uh and so I tell a

729
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:22.070
story about how um every natural kind is a

730
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.989
kind in the making. Uh SOME of those in

731
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.159
the making kind become empty at some point when

732
00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:31.669
we discovered that maybe there's some violation of fundamental

733
00:44:31.679 --> 00:44:34.520
laws. Uh So we believed in caloric, for example,

734
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.770
back in the 19th century, people believed that there

735
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.000
was a substance called caloric that was responsible for

736
00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:44.169
transitional state from ice to say water to, to

737
00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:48.570
steam. Um But some of the uh inferences that

738
00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.919
people made about what are the phenomena that are

739
00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:55.830
captured by the Nashua Khan Caloric uh were clearly

740
00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.419
inferences that very soon revealed their limits. So um

741
00:45:00.429 --> 00:45:04.149
reveal their limits because very often they were appealing

742
00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:08.189
to um features of the phenomena that were simply

743
00:45:08.199 --> 00:45:12.520
false. So, Sadiq Karno was one of the um

744
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.889
key people in the uh formulation of the KO

745
00:45:16.229 --> 00:45:19.340
principles and the car cycle. So Ko believed in

746
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.790
caloric back in the first half of the 19th

747
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.810
century. And he believed that there was a substance

748
00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.729
that was uh uh physically conserved whenever a hot

749
00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:33.229
reservoir goes into cold reservoir. And then a new

750
00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:37.189
cycle starts behind like a steam engine. Uh BUT

751
00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:40.159
obviously, there is no conserve calor and there is

752
00:45:40.169 --> 00:45:42.800
no conservation of caloric and there is no perpetual

753
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.600
motion machine and in fact, can be created using

754
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.040
that principle. So this is where we face the

755
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:51.969
tribunal of experience where we can't say we could

756
00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:57.020
have had now in 2023 an Act kind caloric

757
00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.280
still alive. And well, no, we couldn't have had

758
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:04.860
that right, because we soon stumbled into some problems

759
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.250
about some of those very phenomena that were identified,

760
00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:11.225
identified as the phenomenon where caloric was, was at

761
00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.475
work. And uh and the fact that there was

762
00:46:13.485 --> 00:46:15.514
no conservation of caloric and if anything there was

763
00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:17.864
dissipation, which was then captured by the concept of

764
00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.745
entropy and so forth revealed the limits of those

765
00:46:20.754 --> 00:46:23.395
associations. So, so kind of long winded answer to

766
00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:27.885
your question, the contingentism means that although things could

767
00:46:27.895 --> 00:46:30.935
have gone otherwise in how communities came to make

768
00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:35.254
inferences about phenomenon connection between phenomena, things could not

769
00:46:35.264 --> 00:46:39.840
have gone entirely in a completely different ways because

770
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:43.000
in a way, there are those constraints concerning low

771
00:46:43.129 --> 00:46:47.649
like dependencies of the phenomena that uh really act

772
00:46:47.659 --> 00:46:51.489
as pointers in the garden of working path about

773
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.790
which inferences we decide to go down to and

774
00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.770
which inferences we decide to abandon at some point.

775
00:46:59.689 --> 00:46:59.750
I

776
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.399
understand. So getting into the last part of our

777
00:47:03.409 --> 00:47:07.929
interview, could you tell us now about multiculturalism and

778
00:47:07.939 --> 00:47:12.689
cosmo cosmopolitanism? Science? I mean, uh is science a

779
00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:18.260
multicultural and cosmopolitan enterprise? And what role do these

780
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:24.120
two things? Multiculturalism and cosmopolitan, cosmopolitanism play in science?

781
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.260
Yeah. No, thank you. So this is the final

782
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.540
chapter of the book and it's um um I

783
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.090
wanted to write that chapter because um I, I

784
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.379
thought the book was going to be complete without

785
00:47:37.389 --> 00:47:41.909
a final discussion about what really um questions about

786
00:47:41.919 --> 00:47:46.419
realism and perspective iss uh are doing in, in

787
00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:49.899
this context. Um So very often in the debate

788
00:47:49.909 --> 00:47:53.979
on realism, philosophers have appealed to the aims of

789
00:47:53.989 --> 00:47:55.989
science. So it seems that, you know, we care

790
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.949
about discussion about realism and the realism and truth

791
00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:05.459
and representation because we want to fundamentally um answer

792
00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:08.780
questions about what is the goal of science and

793
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:14.899
what is the aim? Um And I thought that

794
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:19.370
perspective of realism was not really answering that question

795
00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:21.939
about what the aim of goal of science is.

796
00:48:22.729 --> 00:48:26.340
Uh WHAT perspective of realism does is to um

797
00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:30.669
offer a different lens for thinking about realism in

798
00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:38.250
science, starting with this plurality of situated communities. And

799
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.570
once you take that step, the next step is

800
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:46.500
to think of questions about duties and obligations in

801
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.739
science and rights in science. So no questions, aims

802
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.449
and goals. But actually what is science for who

803
00:48:54.459 --> 00:48:58.919
produces science? Who has to benefit from science, who

804
00:48:58.929 --> 00:49:02.590
can reclaim as their own a right to benefit

805
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.620
from scientific knowledge. So the first chapter in a

806
00:49:05.629 --> 00:49:08.270
way, try to answer those, those questions which are

807
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.120
kind of more um ethical political questions about duties

808
00:49:13.129 --> 00:49:17.320
and obligations in science. So, multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism are

809
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:21.320
again huge terms with a very long and often

810
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.219
difficult and vexed history that I wanted to use

811
00:49:24.229 --> 00:49:30.100
to um exactly explain they, they called the natural

812
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.459
perspective of realism. Though it's, there's a perspective of

813
00:49:33.469 --> 00:49:37.310
pluralism that like there's multiculturalism, there's this plurality of

814
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:43.370
historically situated communities that over time produce reliable knowledge

815
00:49:43.379 --> 00:49:48.830
about more robust phenomena. But also an invitation of

816
00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.179
not thinking about that situated nature of knowledge as

817
00:49:53.189 --> 00:49:56.510
some kind of silo where knowledge is produced by

818
00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.129
community in isolation from other communities. Or you know,

819
00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:03.379
this is the um kind of picture that we

820
00:50:03.389 --> 00:50:05.600
had again from, you know, the the tradition of

821
00:50:05.729 --> 00:50:08.070
a Thomas K on scientific paradigms where there is

822
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.030
incommensurability. Um There's a period of crisis and scientific

823
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.979
revolution. Uh And I, I wanted to offer a

824
00:50:14.989 --> 00:50:18.080
different story where it was really an invitation of

825
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.689
not to think of scientific perspectives as siloed. Uh

826
00:50:22.699 --> 00:50:26.949
BUT to think of those communities and their interaction

827
00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:29.729
in terms of what I call intersecting and interlacing

828
00:50:30.209 --> 00:50:35.320
scientific perspectives, perspectives that over time, not only methodological

829
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.399
intersect to allow us to make more reliable inferences

830
00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:42.189
about the phenomenon that we want to study. But

831
00:50:42.199 --> 00:50:48.219
also over time, historically interlace like the um like

832
00:50:48.229 --> 00:50:49.979
in a fabric, like in a piece of cloth

833
00:50:49.989 --> 00:50:52.179
where you have the different threads that are historically

834
00:50:52.189 --> 00:50:56.689
interlaced uh to produce knowledge that effectively is knowledge

835
00:50:56.699 --> 00:50:59.520
that we can reclaim as, as, as knowledge that

836
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:03.429
belong to all of us. And obviously that open

837
00:51:03.439 --> 00:51:05.760
up also the question questions about when is the

838
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:10.469
interlacing virtues? When is the interlacing going badly wrong?

839
00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:15.340
Because there are exploitative practices or epistemic injustices in

840
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.979
the way in which some communities appropriate other communities

841
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:23.320
types of knowledge. So whose knowledge is it? Who,

842
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:27.209
who can be uh uh uh attributed authorship of

843
00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:30.639
particular uh knowledge claims? So those are all very

844
00:51:30.649 --> 00:51:33.969
big questions that I try to simply really map

845
00:51:33.979 --> 00:51:36.209
out in the final chapter and I hope to

846
00:51:36.219 --> 00:51:40.020
get back to. But the idea is that starting

847
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:44.360
with this perspective of pluralism and multiculturalism, we can

848
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.919
articulate a picture about scientific knowledge as reliable knowledge

849
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.909
uh that has to address important epistemic injustice about

850
00:51:52.919 --> 00:51:56.060
what I call the severing and trademarking of knowledge.

851
00:51:56.659 --> 00:52:00.179
And at the same time, has to result in

852
00:52:00.189 --> 00:52:03.570
a broader picture of how knowledge is really knowledge

853
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:08.239
produced by uh uh by humankind for humankind. So

854
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:12.820
that no one should be excluded from benefiting from

855
00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.909
it and benefiting from the advances of scientific knowledge.

856
00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:18.889
So it kind of branches out into debates about

857
00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:22.310
the uh right to science as a uh as

858
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.060
a right that is enshrined in the UN Declaration

859
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:30.070
of Human rights. So everyone is uh should benefit

860
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.709
from um scientific progress and scientific advancement, but it's

861
00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:37.510
obviously not what happens in practice. The scientific knowledge

862
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.689
continues to be privatized, continues to be in the

863
00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:45.030
hands of um few wealthy countries. So um as

864
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.939
I said it as a final chapter that um

865
00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:49.060
I hope to get back to in terms of

866
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.870
my present and future work. But it kind of

867
00:52:51.879 --> 00:52:56.600
shows the broader um um kind of social political

868
00:52:56.610 --> 00:53:00.040
dimensions in which discussions about pluralism and perspective is

869
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.649
and realism play out.

870
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.969
And so my final question for today will be,

871
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:13.709
is science really about producing objective knowledge or knowing

872
00:53:13.719 --> 00:53:16.580
what objective reality is?

873
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.949
Yes, is the answer in so far as we

874
00:53:20.959 --> 00:53:23.699
are clear about what we mean by objective reality,

875
00:53:23.709 --> 00:53:27.590
right? So uh if objective reality means that there

876
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.340
is one way and one way only to uh

877
00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.969
carving natural disjoint, I mean, that's not what perspective

878
00:53:33.979 --> 00:53:38.590
of realism would subscribe to. Uh BUT by objective

879
00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.310
reality, we mean that there is a world of

880
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:45.709
stable events, Koli events uh to which our uh

881
00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:50.909
multifarious inferential practices have to respond. That's, that's objective

882
00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:54.370
enough. And so, yes, scientific knowledge, knowledge of objective

883
00:53:54.379 --> 00:53:59.889
reality within the bounds of uh the historical and

884
00:53:59.899 --> 00:54:04.360
cultural situated practices that we have, we don't have

885
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.879
any God's eye view, we don't have any view

886
00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:08.629
from nowhere. But that doesn't mean that what we

887
00:54:08.639 --> 00:54:13.030
have is just um a fragmented landscape of isolated

888
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:17.199
communities. What we have is a fairly remarkable uh

889
00:54:17.209 --> 00:54:20.459
knowledge produced over time by different communities. And I

890
00:54:20.469 --> 00:54:23.399
think it's something that uh I wanted to celebrate

891
00:54:23.409 --> 00:54:25.790
in, in, in the book. And uh as I

892
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.979
said, it kind of opens up broader questions about

893
00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.989
um who produces knowledge and who should benefit from

894
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.870
knowledge that is entangled in my mind with these

895
00:54:34.879 --> 00:54:36.760
questions about objective reality.

896
00:54:37.439 --> 00:54:41.409
Mhm. Great. So uh I'm leaving a link to

897
00:54:41.419 --> 00:54:43.860
the book in the description box of the interview,

898
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:48.199
which is again, perspective of realism. Uh Doctor Massimi,
