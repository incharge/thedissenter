00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.780
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops.

3
00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:09.679
And today I'm joined by Dr Mia Massimi. She

4
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.250
is Professor of Philosophy of Science in the Department of

5
00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.769
Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, affiliated with the

6
00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:19.379
Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics. She works in the

7
00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:22.545
area of history and Philosophy of Science with the focus

8
00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:26.414
on the physical sciences. And today we are focusing

9
00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:30.295
on her book Perspective of Realism, which by the

10
00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:34.743
way, just recently won the 2023 Lacas awards.

11
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.973
So Dr Massimi, welcome to the show. It's

12
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:40.664
a big pleasure to everyone. Thank you so much

13
00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:44.118
for having me Ricardo to be here. OK.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.719
So to get into the book, I would like

15
00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:50.560
to start by asking you this. So what is

16
00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.779
realism in science? And by the way, uh

17
00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.490
when, when I mean, realism is, are

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.658
there different kinds of realism or not? Sure.

19
00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:04.838
Yeah. So um what we call realism in philosophy

20
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.918
of science is really um a broad um family of

21
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.549
views um that normally are characterized by um series of

22
00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:21.939
commitments um that um are distinctive of what we would

23
00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.838
like to think of a realist position. Now,

24
00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.528
uh what those commitments are obviously um are fairly well

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.260
understood, but also change in a very subtle way

26
00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:38.448
depending on which specific variety of realism one is willing

27
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.088
to subscribe to. Um So I would say that

28
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:48.239
what defines realism are two main commitments. Uh One

29
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.099
is the idea that there is uh uh uh uh

30
00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:59.278
some relationship between science and um nature that is usually

31
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.290
captured by the notion of truth. Um And the

32
00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.359
other is that there has to be some kind of

33
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.360
representational relation between how science and scientific theory, scientific

34
00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:15.490
models relate to the target system. So if you

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.610
ask me, I would say um realism is defined

36
00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:22.669
by those two broad notions of truth and representation.

37
00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.830
Now, obviously, we may disagree about what we

38
00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:27.740
mean by truth. We may disagree slightly about what

39
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.830
we mean by representation, how models represent reality.

40
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.479
Um So, depending on how different philosophers characterize those

41
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.659
notions, you may get different varieties of realism.

42
00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:45.308
Um So, over really the past uh 40 50

43
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.058
years, there has been a proliferation of views that

44
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.558
call themselves or style themselves as realist view. Um

45
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.659
Some of them are um redefining some of those notions

46
00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.080
of truth. So you have variety of pragmatic realism

47
00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:05.689
or internal realism. Um Others are rethinking the exact

48
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.710
nature of the relationship between science and nature um uh

49
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.258
in terms of representation. So you have varieties of

50
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.949
selective realism, for example, that um endorse the

51
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.429
presentational commitment, but they would be selective about which

52
00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.550
aspects of reality the model is committed to represent.

53
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.069
So very broadly, truth and representation are the two

54
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.919
key commitments. Uh And within the broad umbrella,

55
00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.528
there is a, a full spectrum of views that

56
00:03:37.538 --> 00:03:42.149
may slightly differ in how they understand those two notions

57
00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:46.139
and how those two notions enter into um our way

58
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:50.538
of thinking about science and, and reality and related

59
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.179
to that, what would an anti realist stance in

60
00:03:54.189 --> 00:04:01.558
science entail? So, um going back to this

61
00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.050
idea that, you know, truth and representations are

62
00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:10.129
some of the two key commitments. Um uh anti

63
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.080
realist view views and plural can be characterized by uh

64
00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.428
playing down some of those um notions. So for

65
00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.540
example, you find the varieties of instrumentalist views,

66
00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:26.709
they are anti realist views because they are not committed

67
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.988
to the notion that um uh truth is any important

68
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.088
element in the way in which we think about the

69
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.889
relation between science and reality. Um You get varieties

70
00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.639
of constructivism um that likewise uh would challenge the idea

71
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.250
that uh representation really plays an important role in how

72
00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:53.980
models latch onto, onto the world on the realities

73
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.250
. Um So there's a broad spectrum of views really

74
00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.379
going back to um 1980 the scientific image of Basman

75
00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:04.790
Pras. And um that has been a landmark book

76
00:05:04.798 --> 00:05:09.660
for a constructive empiricism. Um It's a classic example

77
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.259
of an anterial view where um the notion of truth

78
00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:15.838
is replaced by notion of empirical adequacy, for example

79
00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:18.410
. So according to a fra and die of science

80
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.559
is not to deliver um theories, they are approximately

81
00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.059
true but to deliver theories, they are pi adequate

82
00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.250
. Um two more recently varieties of epistemological constructivism.

83
00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.309
So, um Mike Boone um building on the process

84
00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:42.428
and defense form a form of constructivism and um how

85
00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.829
she conceptualizes the relationship between models and reality. Um

86
00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.579
So this is just an example, but obviously the

87
00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:55.358
family is much broader than that. And what is

88
00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:01.309
a scientific perspective? Um So it's a great question

89
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.798
, what is STV perspective? So the term um

90
00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.238
has a bit of an history. Um The way

91
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.678
I've been using it in my book um really has

92
00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:14.829
a um a predecessor. The closest predecessor is in

93
00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:19.769
Ron's uh book on scientific perspective is uh the way

94
00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:23.778
Ron Giri originally defined the notion of a scientific perspective

95
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.500
was really in analogy uh with Thomas Coon's notion of

96
00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:32.899
a disciplinary matrix. So disciplinary matrix is a um

97
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.970
a slightly more refined notion of uh probably the more

98
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.899
familiar notion of S and TV paradigm um in the

99
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.480
sense that it indicates uh a family of um practices

100
00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:49.939
and commitments that particular community has at a particular historical

101
00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.569
time. The way in which Rangiri originally defined the

102
00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:57.769
Oslo scientific perspective in, in, in the book

103
00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.569
was really in terms of families or models. So

104
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.809
Rangiri was building on a long standing tradition, going

105
00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.069
back to Patrick Sap in the 19 sixties onwards,

106
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.670
um whereby uh we need to think of scientific theories

107
00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:15.569
as, as families or models. Uh starting with

108
00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:18.548
high level models, uh representational models, going all

109
00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.939
the way down to um models of the experiment,

110
00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.899
data model and so forth. What I do in

111
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.689
the book is to slightly move away from Maroni's definition

112
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.569
. Um Because I would like to think of a

113
00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:36.949
scientific perspective as something broader than just the family of

114
00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:41.290
models. So for me, a scientific perspective is

115
00:07:41.298 --> 00:07:46.358
the historically and culturally situated practice of particular communities,

116
00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:49.528
a particular historical time. And I understand really this

117
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.108
notion of practice in a very, very broad sense

118
00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:59.048
um um to include varieties of knowledge that um may

119
00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:05.579
not necessarily have well defined formalized modeling practices. Um

120
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.350
So broadly speaking, a scientific perspective is a,

121
00:08:09.358 --> 00:08:13.920
is a historically situated practice of a community. And

122
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.160
um here I borrow on the literature in epistemology.

123
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.600
Um there's been again, a very important literature on

124
00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:24.699
perspective is coming from epistemology and Aaron Sosa in particular

125
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:30.119
knowledge in perspective uh book uh from which I'm drawing

126
00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:33.080
in thinking that really what SN TV perspective does is

127
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.349
not just to um advance um a series of claims

128
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:43.859
of knowledge, but also provide the um experimental theoretical

129
00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:48.500
and technological tools for reliably making those claims of knowledge

130
00:08:48.849 --> 00:08:54.619
as well as providing um methodological and epistemic principles that

131
00:08:54.629 --> 00:09:01.700
can justify the reliability of um of our uh uh

132
00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:05.019
uh uh practices for making those claims of knowledge.

133
00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:09.469
So it's kind of a a three fold distinction between

134
00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:13.139
the body of claims of knowledge, the experimental theoretical

135
00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:16.609
conceptual tools to reliably make them and the methodological epistemic

136
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:20.908
principle that justify the reliability of those uh of those

137
00:09:20.918 --> 00:09:22.509
tools. And that's the, the, the very

138
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:24.889
broad way in which I've been using the term in

139
00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:31.658
the book. And what about a perspective of realism

140
00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:35.359
? What does it mean exactly? And what flavor

141
00:09:35.369 --> 00:09:39.239
of realism applies to it? So, um yeah

142
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.609
, that's a great question. Going back to the

143
00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:45.719
original question about varieties of realism and family of realism

144
00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.719
. Um I'd like to think of prospect our realism

145
00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:52.158
as a view that is committed to the notion of

146
00:09:52.168 --> 00:09:58.719
truth as correspondence and the idea that um our theories

147
00:09:58.729 --> 00:10:01.570
, our models especially uh represent reality. So it's

148
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.500
a realist view. But the way I present the

149
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:07.469
view in the book is that it, it's not

150
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:11.678
a metaphysics first uh view about realism. So very

151
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.759
often what you find is that realism is defined by

152
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:22.048
uh metaphysics first approaches. So if someone declared themselves

153
00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:24.899
a realist, what they really mean is that they

154
00:10:24.908 --> 00:10:28.279
are committed to spelling out to what the metaphysical building

155
00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:33.349
blocks of nature are or they are committed to um

156
00:10:33.359 --> 00:10:35.989
tell a story about uh what the metaphysical foundations of

157
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.590
reality are. And the metaphysical story typically involves um

158
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.908
different flavors of metaphysics. So some people are committed

159
00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:50.320
to natural properties others are committed to the there are

160
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.719
dispositions um or other people believe in causal powers.

161
00:10:56.279 --> 00:11:01.029
Um per the realism is not a metaphysics first approach

162
00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:03.759
in the sense that although there is a metaphysical part

163
00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:07.599
, uh which is the second part of the book

164
00:11:07.609 --> 00:11:11.558
, um the primary aim is really um trying to

165
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.788
uh uh in a way show how that metaphysical commitment

166
00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:20.168
is really downstream to an epistemological project. So what

167
00:11:20.178 --> 00:11:24.788
really matters to me is to trying to understand how

168
00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:28.529
we produce reliable knowledge over time and how a plurality

169
00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:35.469
of historical and cultural situated perspectives um are able to

170
00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:39.219
uh deliver that reliable knowledge over time. So um

171
00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:43.590
I see realism not so much as uh um an

172
00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:48.759
exercise in trying to uh unveil the metaphysical building block

173
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:52.769
of nature, but I see metaphysics as the downstream

174
00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.590
outcome of how we tell a story about how we

175
00:11:56.599 --> 00:12:01.109
produce reliable knowledge over time. So there is a

176
00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:03.940
metaphysical part. So ultimately, spec of realism is

177
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.149
realism about phenomena about modally robust phenomenon. And that

178
00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:11.928
obviously involves really finding the very notion of phenomena that

179
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.899
has a long philosophical history. And it's, it's

180
00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:16.729
, it's part of what they're doing in the second

181
00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:18.168
part of the book. So if you ask me

182
00:12:18.178 --> 00:12:20.428
, what kind of flavor is perspective, a realism

183
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.849
, it's really realism about moderate robust phenomena. Um

184
00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:28.928
But as I said, I see that metaphysical commitment

185
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.379
as, as the outcome of uh um uh a

186
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:37.149
more important exercise, which is trying to understand how

187
00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:41.080
um different communities over time and culture produce reliable knowledge

188
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:46.119
over time. But then where is, where exactly

189
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:50.330
is the perspective, all nature in scientific representation?

190
00:12:52.558 --> 00:12:54.859
So, yeah, what that perspective is enters into

191
00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:56.668
the story of how we produce reliable knowledge, right

192
00:12:56.678 --> 00:13:01.340
? So um I can think of a plurality of

193
00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:05.269
communities that are historical and cultural situated, different historical

194
00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.979
periods, different cultures and so forth. Can we

195
00:13:07.989 --> 00:13:11.739
tell a story about how that knowledge is produced a

196
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.428
across these different communities? And how is that story

197
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.629
going to look like? Um So one thing I

198
00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.879
definitely wanted to do in the book is to avoid

199
00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:26.009
any um standard template that you find in the literature

200
00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:31.529
on realism about realism of being some kind of convergence

201
00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:35.219
to a reality that um in a way we all

202
00:13:35.229 --> 00:13:39.330
agree upon. Um There is no convergence in perspective

203
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.090
of realism. Um The way I use often this

204
00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:46.389
metaphor in the book taken for um the, the

205
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.279
o Borges at the Garden of Forking Path, they

206
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.369
are uh producing knowledge is a bit like going through

207
00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:56.308
a garden of forking path and kind of zigzagging where

208
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.928
at each juncture, we have to make a choice

209
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.830
about which path we want to go down. So

210
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.298
there is no uh or underlying picture, the realism

211
00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:07.678
is a convergence to because really it's a realism about

212
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:13.190
phenomena, there's no realism about any fundamental metaphysical reality

213
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.769
, as I said, the cause of powers,

214
00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:16.320
dispositional essence is that we want to call it.

215
00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:22.580
Um So those phenomena are encountered by different communities across

216
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.219
different periods and across different cultures um in a reliable

217
00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:28.250
way or in a way that we are able to

218
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:33.779
uh uh to see how their situated practices intersect with

219
00:14:33.788 --> 00:14:35.149
one another. So this is where the perspective that

220
00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:39.759
comes in, right? Because traditionally, um the

221
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:45.538
very idea that the starting point of conversations about realism

222
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.710
um is, is, is, is is human

223
00:14:48.719 --> 00:14:52.599
beings in their plurality and historically and cultural situated,

224
00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:58.440
this has appeared to be a stumbling block to any

225
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.759
realist project. How could one ever possibly defend realism

226
00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:05.769
, especially about science? Once we take really seriously

227
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:11.509
that there is a plurality of um historically situated communities

228
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.869
and their culture. So that was the starting point

229
00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.950
of my um kind of journey uh for the book

230
00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.058
. Um I went back to the notion of representation

231
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.440
. I said at the beginning through the representations are

232
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.639
the two key commitment of any realist view. And

233
00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:31.038
I wanted to understand what makes some representations pers respectable

234
00:15:31.048 --> 00:15:35.700
and whether there is a way of reconciling the perspective

235
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.798
of representation with realism. Um So at the very

236
00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:41.658
beginning of the book, I go back to the

237
00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:45.619
analogy between art and science and that has been well

238
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:48.109
explored since the time of, well, it's a

239
00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:50.950
long story, long tradition really. Uh but more

240
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.859
recently, Basra and 2008 book on a scientific representation

241
00:15:54.869 --> 00:15:58.019
, paradoxes of perspectives has been a very influential uh

242
00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:02.750
book for uh for my own personal journey, but

243
00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:07.609
also Kathrine Elgin uh 2017 book. Uh True Enough

244
00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:11.389
, uh is also very important for discussing the perspective

245
00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.440
nature of representation. And so really thinking about the

246
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.889
analogy between art and science, what makes some representation

247
00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:21.969
perspect? Traditionally, we tend to think of that

248
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:26.090
uh question in terms of the representation is situated is

249
00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:30.969
from a particular vantage point. So um a drawing

250
00:16:30.979 --> 00:16:33.769
, a perspective drawing is what makes the drawing perspective

251
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.869
is that the scene is painted from a particular angle

252
00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:41.719
. And obviously, the angle means that there are

253
00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:45.460
other aspects of the scene that we can't really see

254
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:47.320
uh from that particular angle. So there is an

255
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.379
element of lusion and there is what Vansen called um

256
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:55.849
a horizon of alternatives. We could have chosen to

257
00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:57.779
represent the scene from different angles and we could have

258
00:16:57.788 --> 00:17:03.689
chosen to represent the object with different attributes. Um

259
00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:07.577
So the story I turn in chapter two and three

260
00:17:07.587 --> 00:17:10.327
of the book, which is really the beginning of

261
00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:12.917
the of the book is that very often that specific

262
00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:19.049
way of thinking about perspective of representation um has been

263
00:17:19.098 --> 00:17:23.459
um regarded as a as a, as a difficulty

264
00:17:23.469 --> 00:17:29.489
for any realism or a realist project. Um Precisely

265
00:17:29.499 --> 00:17:32.458
because if the representation is situated is from a particular

266
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.648
angle, how can we ever be in a position

267
00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:37.388
of saying what the real nature of the object is

268
00:17:37.398 --> 00:17:41.847
, our knowledge is always partially occluded and, and

269
00:17:41.858 --> 00:17:45.088
, and, and not complete. Um So the

270
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:45.930
story I tell is that, well, actually,

271
00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:48.868
if you look at the nature of perspective and drawing

272
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.279
in art, um there are two ways of thinking

273
00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:56.088
about perspective, um a representation is perspective, not

274
00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:57.400
only because it's drawn from a particular angle, but

275
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.279
because it's also drawn towards one or more vantage point

276
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:04.500
. Actually, technically, this is the definition of

277
00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:08.949
a perspect uh representation that um there is one or

278
00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:14.689
more vantage point towards which lines converge. And that's

279
00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:17.029
what creates the optical illusion that you can see a

280
00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:19.150
three dimensional space on what effectively is a two dimensional

281
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.309
canvas. Um And, and so I play with

282
00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:26.279
that metaphor in art to say, well, really

283
00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:27.618
, those are two aspects of the same coin really

284
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.578
, you know, you the representation is perspect as

285
00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:33.660
drawn from a particular vantage point only in so far

286
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.559
as there is one or more vantage points that allows

287
00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:40.848
us to create this, this these windows of reality

288
00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:44.219
, uh this, this three dimensional space emerging out

289
00:18:44.229 --> 00:18:47.039
of a two dimensional canvas. And so that's my

290
00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:48.049
entry point for the idea that there is a way

291
00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:52.368
of telling a story about realism starting with the situated

292
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.910
nature of the representation. So tell us now about

293
00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.000
the notion of pluralism. Where is it and how

294
00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:06.519
does it apply to science? Yeah. So pluralism

295
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:10.328
is really uh again, a big family of views

296
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.670
. Uh I'm drawing really here on a long standing

297
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.239
tradition that has emphasized the importance of pluralism in science

298
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:25.400
. Um explanatory pluralism and methodological pluralism uh tradition.

299
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.818
Going back to Ellen Longino and uh Carol, a

300
00:19:27.828 --> 00:19:32.140
fair and Miriam Solomon and Sandra Mitchell, integrity,

301
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.660
pluralism. Obviously, John Dupre promiscuous realism and many

302
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.368
, many, many others. Um the kind of

303
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:44.289
pluralism um that matters to my story is again,

304
00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.009
perspect about pluralism is pluralism of perspectives as I have

305
00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:51.259
defined it. Uh So my emphasis is not so

306
00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:56.150
much on um explanatory methodological or ontological pluralism. It's

307
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.750
really pluralism about uh uh historically, cult is the

308
00:20:00.769 --> 00:20:03.559
practices. It's, it's a fact that science is

309
00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:08.118
the outcome of this plurality of perspectives and communities that

310
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:14.029
have endorsed different practices. Um And then obviously,

311
00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.588
then the question becomes OK. Um As I was

312
00:20:15.598 --> 00:20:19.430
just saying with the problem of perspective or representation is

313
00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:22.229
pers sorry, representation from a point of view,

314
00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:26.880
representation uh uh towards one or more vantage point,

315
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:30.309
the question is OK, if you take the pluralism

316
00:20:30.318 --> 00:20:34.578
as a fact about science, what kind of uh

317
00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:40.250
realism emerges out of that, can we even talk

318
00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:42.500
about realism or should we just say that we are

319
00:20:42.949 --> 00:20:48.969
um confined to a plurality of um ways of knowing

320
00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:52.289
they are distinctive of different communities and their practices?

321
00:20:52.939 --> 00:20:56.719
Um But we can't really attempt to tell a story

322
00:20:56.729 --> 00:21:02.500
about science and scientific knowledge and, and realism about

323
00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:03.838
science and the best that we can do is this

324
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.900
plurality of scientific practices. So, what I do

325
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:07.949
in the book is to say, no, no

326
00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:11.420
, no. We, we can take the pluralism

327
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.160
, perspect of pluralism as a starting point. It's

328
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.410
a fact about science. The science is produced in

329
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.568
that way. But that doesn't mean that we need

330
00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:23.640
to end up with some kind of instrumentalist or anti

331
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:27.180
realist view. There's still a way of defending realism

332
00:21:27.189 --> 00:21:33.739
in science. Um starting with perspect about pluralism.

333
00:21:33.489 --> 00:21:37.939
Mhm And so another thing that you tackle in your

334
00:21:37.949 --> 00:21:41.799
book is the problem of inconsistent model. So what

335
00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:47.130
is that problem really about and can perspective is help

336
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.818
us tackle it? Yeah. So kind of zooming

337
00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:55.479
into uh this problem of how to reconcile um Perspect

338
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.529
about pluralism as pluralism of perspectives and, and realism

339
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.699
. The problem in consistent models uh is, is

340
00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:04.479
, is one of, is one of the major

341
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:10.519
problem for any perspective is um because this is where

342
00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:15.890
we the pluralism um appears to be somehow at odds

343
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.949
with any realist claim. Um So it's a problem

344
00:22:19.959 --> 00:22:25.059
that was really brought to the general attention um maybe

345
00:22:25.068 --> 00:22:29.880
13 years ago uh roughly uh by uh Mary Morrison

346
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.750
um in a, in a beautiful paper where she

347
00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:36.969
discusses the plurality of models in some areas of science

348
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:37.920
. So she says, well, look at nuclear

349
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.709
physics, right? Um So the areas of science

350
00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:44.229
where there is one model, we all agree more

351
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:45.299
or less that uh you know, it is the

352
00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:49.299
um best model to describe some kind of phenomena.

353
00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:51.930
But there are other areas where there seems to be

354
00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:55.160
a pluralism, a kind of endemic pluralism and as

355
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.150
, as pluralism of models. So the example of

356
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.279
Morrison is that if you look at nuclear physics,

357
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:03.348
and if you ask the question about what is the

358
00:23:03.358 --> 00:23:07.049
atomic nucleus, um you find different answers to the

359
00:23:07.059 --> 00:23:11.578
question depending on whether we are studying a nuclear fission

360
00:23:11.588 --> 00:23:14.900
. In which case, we represent the nucleus as

361
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.769
if it was a liquid of incompressible nuclear fluid.

362
00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:22.229
Uh But if we are studying um stellar nucleus synthesis

363
00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:25.838
, we use different families of models, the cluster

364
00:23:25.848 --> 00:23:30.259
model whereby the atomic nucleus is represented as a tetrahedron

365
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.650
with a particular structures of problems and neutrons. And

366
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.910
obviously, if we're studying other phenomena in high energy

367
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.289
physics, we use yet another class of models.

368
00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:44.250
We use the quark models to describe what happens when

369
00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:47.930
we smash protons to say at LHC. So Morrison

370
00:23:47.939 --> 00:23:49.559
Point was, well, if we have this pluralism

371
00:23:49.568 --> 00:23:53.479
of models, does it even make sense to ask

372
00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:56.699
what is the atomic nucleus? I mean, w

373
00:23:56.709 --> 00:23:57.799
where is the realism there? Right? I mean

374
00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.489
, we have different stories about what the nucleus is

375
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.640
. Um is there one which is the best one

376
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.299
? And if, if there is, then what

377
00:24:06.309 --> 00:24:08.160
about the others? Isn't it better to adopt some

378
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:15.088
kind of instrumental is um perspective is, has often

379
00:24:15.098 --> 00:24:19.078
been accused of being a form of instrumental is so

380
00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:23.489
um Morrison uh argument in that paper that has also

381
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:29.078
been rested by other philosophers like an Chakravorti, for

382
00:24:29.088 --> 00:24:30.529
example, in um in, in, in,

383
00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:34.108
in, in his book on um the the kind

384
00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:37.660
of metaphysics of nature is that very often perspective is

385
00:24:37.719 --> 00:24:41.430
, doesn't live up to the promise of realism because

386
00:24:41.439 --> 00:24:45.630
it looks like uh what we really mean by perspective

387
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.380
is is the representation is drawn from a particular point

388
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.250
of view. So if you look at the nucleus

389
00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:53.410
from the point of view of um fission, then

390
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.299
it looks like a liquid drop. But if you

391
00:24:56.309 --> 00:24:59.130
look at the nucleus from the point of view of

392
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.150
stellar nucleus synthesis, then it looks like a tetrad

393
00:25:02.608 --> 00:25:03.229
. And I think it's that way of thinking about

394
00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:08.170
perspective is that has really um meant that perspective is

395
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.900
for a long time as has been regarded as kind

396
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.519
of no much for realism. Um So I tackled

397
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:17.949
the problem of inconsistent models in chapter three of the

398
00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:21.039
book. And um I show that the problem is

399
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:25.199
not really a problem for perspective is in so far

400
00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:29.719
as we are clear about um some hidden assumptions that

401
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:32.459
seems to be creeping into the argument. And so

402
00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:34.920
some of those assumptions are uh in my view are

403
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:40.469
, are really um kind of very demanding and unduly

404
00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:45.390
stringent realist assumption that seems to assume that models represent

405
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.328
by mapping 1 to 1 aspects of the model with

406
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:52.930
aspects of the target system. And that seems to

407
00:25:52.939 --> 00:25:56.029
understand the notion of truth going back to representation of

408
00:25:56.039 --> 00:26:00.049
truth in terms of uh truth maker. So there

409
00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:03.029
has to be a ontological state of affairs in terms

410
00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:07.289
of ascription of essential properties to particular that make some

411
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:10.838
claims of knowledge true. And now if one endorses

412
00:26:10.848 --> 00:26:14.170
that view about truth, the truth makers and representation

413
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.430
as mapping, I think Morrison has a point that

414
00:26:18.439 --> 00:26:21.160
this plurality of model seems to be a problem for

415
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.680
, for realism, we can't think of the nucleus

416
00:26:22.689 --> 00:26:29.578
as having inconsistent or incompatible essential properties. Um But

417
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.219
what I do in chapter three of the book is

418
00:26:30.229 --> 00:26:34.150
to resist that assumption and saying, uh why,

419
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.779
why do we need to buy into representation as mapping

420
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:40.868
or what do we need to buy into truth as

421
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.009
truth maker? Maybe there is a different way of

422
00:26:42.019 --> 00:26:47.420
thinking about what models do and how they represent from

423
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.939
a perspective or point of view that doesn't necessarily land

424
00:26:49.949 --> 00:26:56.068
us into this um uh quo of inconsistent essential properties

425
00:26:56.078 --> 00:27:00.088
ascribed to the same target system. And so it's

426
00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:02.910
a very important problem because it's really um the starting

427
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.239
point of a way of reconciling realism or perspective is

428
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.608
and uh related to perspective modeling and perspective of models

429
00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:19.598
. Um What do you mean by them being blueprints

430
00:27:19.608 --> 00:27:22.699
on reality as you say in the book? And

431
00:27:22.709 --> 00:27:27.019
uh perhaps related to these, how do the concepts

432
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:33.769
of conceivability and possibility enter into it. Yeah.

433
00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:37.640
So um what I do from chapter four or five

434
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.618
onwards is to spell out the positive story, right

435
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.848
? And not just to say, we need to

436
00:27:41.858 --> 00:27:45.969
resist all this assumption and duly stringent assumption. So

437
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:48.328
um a different way of thinking about what models do

438
00:27:48.338 --> 00:27:52.818
is to tell a different story about how to represent

439
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.959
their target system without ascribing essential properties to the target

440
00:27:56.969 --> 00:28:00.098
system. So in that context that develop the view

441
00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:03.750
that models really are inferential blueprints, so they are

442
00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:07.630
blueprints that allows different communities. And again, think

443
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.130
of a plurality of historical and cultural situated communities to

444
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:17.930
draw inferences about relevant model, robust phenomena from a

445
00:28:17.939 --> 00:28:22.309
plurality of data set. So what the model does

446
00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:26.519
is not so much mapping 1 to 1 aspects of

447
00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:27.838
the model and aspects of reality. I think we

448
00:28:27.848 --> 00:28:30.949
have been very often in philosophy, science, we

449
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:33.309
have this picture that models represent. But as if

450
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:37.789
really the primary function of the model was to mirror

451
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:41.140
a map onto the target system, right? But

452
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.739
that idea seems very counterintuitive to me even I mean

453
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.199
, think of well established model like the DN model

454
00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:48.709
of the nucleus, right. I mean, we

455
00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:52.150
don't, we don't use the model because we want

456
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.489
to necessarily represent the nucleus, we use the model

457
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.939
because we want to make inferences right about the that

458
00:28:57.949 --> 00:29:00.140
we want to study, we want to understand how

459
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.219
DNA behaves, we want to understand how uh possible

460
00:29:04.229 --> 00:29:07.328
error in the um in the in the process of

461
00:29:07.338 --> 00:29:12.670
DNA uh uh chain of events may happen. So

462
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.309
we, we want to ask those questions about what

463
00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:21.650
is possible about DNA replication and mistakes in the DNA

464
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.699
replication. So think of models really as catering to

465
00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:30.000
this needs of allowing us to make uh uh relevant

466
00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:33.670
and appropriate inferences about phenomena that we want to study

467
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.858
. So that's what the metaphor of inferential blueprint is

468
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.420
. So models yes, do represent and do represent

469
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.289
from a specific vantage point. That's why we have

470
00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:45.219
a plurality of models used by different communities. The

471
00:29:45.229 --> 00:29:48.469
primary function is not to ascribe essential properties to the

472
00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:51.108
target system. As the metaphysicians would like us to

473
00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:53.039
think of the primary function is to allow communities to

474
00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:59.118
make reliable, robust, relevant and appropriate inferences about

475
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.239
those uh uh those phenomena that, that, that

476
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.660
we want to study. And so again, I

477
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.630
use the analogy very often as I do in the

478
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:11.098
book between um uh uh uh perspective of representation in

479
00:30:11.108 --> 00:30:11.930
this case in architecture. So the idea of the

480
00:30:11.939 --> 00:30:17.118
inferential blueprints is borrowed from, from architecture because again

481
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.390
, in, in, in, in architecture,

482
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.680
you can have uh um a plurality of perspective or

483
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:25.779
representation of say a house that allows different communities of

484
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:29.519
the carpenter and the masons and the architects to work

485
00:30:29.529 --> 00:30:33.568
together and make inferences about how the house should be

486
00:30:33.578 --> 00:30:37.000
built. How tall should the roof be? What's

487
00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:40.019
the relationship between the height of the door and the

488
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:41.838
height of the roof. Uh And so I use

489
00:30:41.848 --> 00:30:45.559
an analogy to say likewise, whenever we want to

490
00:30:45.568 --> 00:30:48.739
study specific phenomenon, that plurality of models allows these

491
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.799
different communities to make those uh uh relevant and appropriate

492
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:56.219
inferences about the objects so that we want to study

493
00:30:56.989 --> 00:31:00.680
. Um So they find in models as really catering

494
00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:04.588
to um the need of delivering knowledge about what is

495
00:31:04.598 --> 00:31:08.338
possible about the object under study. So, perspect

496
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:12.608
modeling is modeling possibilities, modeling, how things could

497
00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:15.900
be. Um And it's, it's a way of

498
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.979
answering those questions in a kind of very exploratory way

499
00:31:18.989 --> 00:31:22.640
where we have not just one community that can reclaim

500
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.838
full ownership of the knowledge of the target system,

501
00:31:26.848 --> 00:31:30.160
but we need a plurality of communities that I illustrate

502
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.900
with various case studies in the book. So I

503
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.568
have one chapter on climate change. So climate modeling

504
00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:38.939
in the context of studying um uh global warming,

505
00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:45.529
one chapter on developmental psychology and one chapter on the

506
00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:48.769
nuclear physics where I show how in each case to

507
00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:52.160
study specific phenomena like the stability of some nuclear or

508
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.630
difficulties with reading or global warming. We need a

509
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.229
plurality of community. So if you want to study

510
00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:04.680
climate change and global warming, you need a plurality

511
00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:09.519
of people that model um increase in ocean heat temperature

512
00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:15.250
uh communities that model how glacier and permafrost are changing

513
00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:19.519
under the effect of greenhouse gasses. Communities that study

514
00:32:19.529 --> 00:32:22.519
corals and uh uh tree rings. So then thema

515
00:32:22.838 --> 00:32:25.868
again to make inferences from those data to the phenomena

516
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.289
under study. And so it's through that plurality of

517
00:32:30.299 --> 00:32:32.959
modeling practices and, and communities that we come to

518
00:32:32.969 --> 00:32:39.140
know very complex and multifactorial phenomena like um global warming

519
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.578
, for example. So that that's how I use

520
00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:45.969
the analogy with models as inferential blueprint to explain our

521
00:32:45.979 --> 00:32:47.598
models. Yes, represent, yes, represent from

522
00:32:47.608 --> 00:32:51.529
a perspect point of view. But they do so

523
00:32:51.568 --> 00:32:54.170
by effectively delivering knowledge about what is possible concerning the

524
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:59.078
object that we want to study. So earlier in

525
00:32:59.088 --> 00:33:02.078
our conversation, you alluded to this. Uh But

526
00:33:02.108 --> 00:33:07.779
what are they, what are phenomena and what is

527
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:13.180
the relationship between them through this framework of perspective of

528
00:33:13.229 --> 00:33:17.709
realism? Yeah. So um going back to uh

529
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.189
exactly the question of what flavor of realism is basically

530
00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:22.920
our realism, as I mentioned in the beginning,

531
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:27.420
it's really a realism about phenomena. But I,

532
00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:30.118
one of the main task of the book was to

533
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.959
redefine what I mean by phenomenon. This phenomena come

534
00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:37.420
from a long standing empi traditions that really stretches back

535
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:42.368
to, you know, pm 19 05, a

536
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:45.400
wonderful book on to save the phenomenon more recently,

537
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.328
wasn't to Pras and I mentioned already in 1980 scientific

538
00:33:47.338 --> 00:33:51.880
image. Um that also defends the view that um

539
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.680
you know, the reality is reality made of phenomena

540
00:33:53.689 --> 00:33:59.449
observable phenomena according to Tora. Um So it's very

541
00:33:59.459 --> 00:34:01.368
difficult to say that I'm a realist about phenomena when

542
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.910
the very term phenomenon has been associated with uh a

543
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.708
long standing and pis tradition that is normally regarded phenomena

544
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:15.628
is not the sort of objects that one would have

545
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:19.849
real and commitment to. Um So what I do

546
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.369
in the second part of the book is trying to

547
00:34:22.378 --> 00:34:25.898
um articulate the positive story and the positive story is

548
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:30.849
that um given this perspect of pluralism, uh where

549
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.929
models are embedded as part of the practices of different

550
00:34:34.938 --> 00:34:39.378
communities, the inferences that we make are inferences to

551
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:43.340
what I call moly robust phenomena. So what are

552
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.030
moly robust phenomena? They're not the phenomena of the

553
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.070
fro and they're not the phenomenal of Pierre do m

554
00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:52.860
they're not the phenomena of the Empire tradition as um

555
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:59.438
faint copies or faint images of a reality uh that

556
00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:02.239
lies underneath the phenomenon that we need to discover uh

557
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:07.079
you know, appealing to the metaphysician tools or whatever

558
00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.969
dispositional essences or because of powers uh phenomena of what

559
00:35:10.978 --> 00:35:15.590
there is in a way I'm um borrowing from the

560
00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.708
country and tradition, the idea that knowledge is knowledge

561
00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:20.918
of phenomena, but those phenomena not in pieces,

562
00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:22.949
phenomena more robust. And what I really mean by

563
00:35:22.958 --> 00:35:28.918
more of robustness is that phenomena stable event. So

564
00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:32.199
there's a kind of 22 tier ontology that I articulate

565
00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:35.360
in chapter six of the book. So phenomena are

566
00:35:35.369 --> 00:35:38.188
stable event index to a particular domain and they are

567
00:35:38.199 --> 00:35:44.820
modally robust across a plurality of data to phenomena inferences

568
00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:46.530
. So there are stable events in that, that

569
00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:51.329
there is a level of reality that are called stable

570
00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.239
event where stability is really synonymous with low likeness for

571
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:59.760
me. So um stable events are events that are

572
00:35:59.769 --> 00:36:01.648
such not because they are core ones, but because

573
00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:06.438
there are low like dependencies in in the fabric of

574
00:36:06.449 --> 00:36:08.320
those events. So that explain why they are stable

575
00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:14.079
. But the phenomenon is not just a stable event

576
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.260
. Uh The phenomenon is the outcome of an inference

577
00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:22.579
made by communities from data understood broadly as empirical occurrences

578
00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:25.849
. So to give an example that I um given

579
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.260
the book, um it is a stable event that

580
00:36:30.269 --> 00:36:36.239
an electric charge is gonna be affected by an electric

581
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.688
or magnetic field. So there are low like dependencies

582
00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:42.369
that explains how an electric charge is going to be

583
00:36:42.378 --> 00:36:45.989
deflected by an external field, that's a stable event

584
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.079
in nature. But what we called um cathode ray

585
00:36:51.188 --> 00:36:53.800
or the phenomenon of the bending of cathode rays is

586
00:36:53.809 --> 00:36:59.179
the model robust phenomenon that uh was discovered by JJ

587
00:36:59.188 --> 00:37:01.929
Thompson at the end of the 19th century using a

588
00:37:01.938 --> 00:37:07.438
a particular tool that was a cato tube working in

589
00:37:07.449 --> 00:37:10.179
a particular historically cap situated context. There was the

590
00:37:10.188 --> 00:37:15.019
Victorian Cambridge of the end of the century. Um

591
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.550
And, and so the phenomenon is not a robust

592
00:37:19.559 --> 00:37:24.570
because we can infer and Reiner um the same phenomenon

593
00:37:24.579 --> 00:37:30.050
from different kind of data sets by slightly tweaking the

594
00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:32.750
experimental conditions. Uh And and so forth. So

595
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.159
the model of robustness is some kind of secondary property

596
00:37:37.168 --> 00:37:38.668
that is really a property of how different communities are

597
00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:43.949
able to robustly infer the same phenomenon from a variety

598
00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:47.409
of, of data. So that's broadly speaking,

599
00:37:47.418 --> 00:37:52.369
the kind of phenomena for so that I I defend

600
00:37:52.378 --> 00:37:55.438
in, in the book and with that in mind

601
00:37:55.449 --> 00:38:00.079
, what are natural kinds and how do we go

602
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:07.079
from phenomena to kinds? So yeah, Um so

603
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.579
, one of the problem I had when I was

604
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.780
writing the book is that I was obviously committed to

605
00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:16.438
defending this phenomenon for so, but I was also

606
00:38:16.688 --> 00:38:20.760
very much aware that when it comes to realism,

607
00:38:20.969 --> 00:38:22.478
um it's not enough to say that we live in

608
00:38:22.489 --> 00:38:25.269
a world where there are moli robust phenomena, the

609
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.809
bending of the cat race, the decay of the

610
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.000
Higgs boson, the growth of the mycelium echolocation in

611
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.780
Beluga. Those are examples of what I call moli

612
00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:37.019
robust phenomena, the pollination of flowers and so forth

613
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:42.409
that require inferences on behalf of communities to stable events

614
00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:46.619
in nature. A realist wants uh something more than

615
00:38:46.628 --> 00:38:52.289
phenomena. A realist want something about natural kinds.

616
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.929
So a realist would say, um I don't just

617
00:38:54.938 --> 00:38:58.280
want to know what the bending of cadore is.

618
00:38:58.289 --> 00:38:59.590
I want to know what the electron is. I

619
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.168
want to know what the nucleus is. I want

620
00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:02.378
to know what genes are. I want to know

621
00:39:02.389 --> 00:39:07.489
, you know um what lemon and zebras and supernovas

622
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.148
. Are so those are natural kinds. So those

623
00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:15.938
are uh kinds of things. And um again,

624
00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:20.530
realism very often has been associated with um number of

625
00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:23.898
views about what national kinds are. Um ranging from

626
00:39:23.909 --> 00:39:27.579
hacking. And no, to I mentioned already,

627
00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.628
John Dupre promiscuous realism to varieties of uh uh um

628
00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:36.489
microstructure and essentialism back to Hillary Patnam in the 19

629
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.019
seventies and so forth. Um So the story I

630
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.969
tell in the book about natural kinds, which really

631
00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:44.260
a long one, it stands from chapter seven to

632
00:39:44.269 --> 00:39:47.639
chapter 10 in the book is that natural kinds are

633
00:39:47.648 --> 00:39:52.708
open ended grouping of historically identified phenomena. There is

634
00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:58.418
nothing more, nothing over uh natural kinds than open

635
00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.039
ended grouping of historical identified phenomena. And obviously,

636
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.110
the big challenge is OK, is this just a

637
00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:07.648
form of conventional, is a natural kind, just

638
00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:09.360
the label that we attach to grouping of phenomena.

639
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:13.829
So I had to go into um quite a lot

640
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.280
of details to clarify why the view is not a

641
00:40:15.289 --> 00:40:19.559
conventional view. And it's not an essentialist view either

642
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.739
. Um But it's really a view that tries to

643
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.639
again bring in the inferential is so phenomena, the

644
00:40:25.648 --> 00:40:30.000
outcome of inferences likewise natural kinds are the outcome of

645
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:35.800
inferences. Um Rob robust, reliable, still revis

646
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.340
still open ended, still very valuable inferences made by

647
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:44.128
plurality of communities over time. Um And so I'll

648
00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:45.800
give a full definition, I give a full inferential

649
00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:51.309
story uh about national kind. They are called natural

650
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.978
kinds with the human face. Borrowing from Hillary but

651
00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:59.250
1990 book realism with a human face. Um What

652
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.639
I explain how those law like dependencies in the fabric

653
00:41:02.648 --> 00:41:07.978
of the stable events provide effectively the um I I

654
00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:10.800
if you like the the kind of pointers in this

655
00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:15.760
walking in the garden of working path in whereby communities

656
00:41:15.769 --> 00:41:21.168
can make uh choices about what to cluster or what

657
00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:23.179
not to cluster into the natural kind. But to

658
00:41:23.188 --> 00:41:27.550
do so reliably, they need to rely on low

659
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:30.148
like dependencies. They are part of the stable events

660
00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:31.360
in nature. So the clustering is not arbitrary,

661
00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:34.570
it is not conventional. And so there is an

662
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:37.800
element of contingencies, but it's not a rampant kind

663
00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:39.668
of contingentism. It's, it's kind of constrained and

664
00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:45.800
guided by um low like dependencies in nature. So

665
00:41:45.809 --> 00:41:49.139
it's a long story from chapter seven to chapter 10

666
00:41:49.148 --> 00:41:51.329
. And I give a full detail of that in

667
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.110
, in, in, in chapter 10 of the

668
00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:55.128
book where I delve into the historical case studies about

669
00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:59.820
the electron. And yeah, sorry. No,

670
00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:01.719
no, no worries. Uh And another thing I

671
00:42:01.728 --> 00:42:04.840
would like to ask you is at a certain point

672
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:07.809
in the book, you talk about contingentism. So

673
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:13.628
what is contingentism and how is it involved in perspective

674
00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:17.340
of realism? So continent is, is associated precisely

675
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:22.510
with um with this point I was making about how

676
00:42:22.519 --> 00:42:27.389
the um open ended grouping of phenomena um is to

677
00:42:27.398 --> 00:42:30.110
some extent contingent in the sense that we could have

678
00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:35.559
cluster different phenomena under the National Kind Electron, for

679
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.519
example, um now continent, this historically has been

680
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:43.750
a very powerful uh argument coming from the history of

681
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.590
science against a very strong um the physical form of

682
00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:52.699
realism. Um um So, I don't know lots

683
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:54.909
of people that contributed to this debate from has Chang

684
00:42:54.918 --> 00:42:59.389
to cons for them. Also Joseph Laporte. Um

685
00:42:59.398 --> 00:43:01.809
so things could have gone otherwise, right? So

686
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.349
Joseph Laporte, in his book on Natural Con and

687
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.809
con change, tell us it is a beautiful story

688
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.280
of how, you know, we made a choice

689
00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:14.938
at some point to include the dirty oxide into um

690
00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:17.469
the natural kind water. But there was a choice

691
00:43:17.478 --> 00:43:19.929
in a way that we made, we could have

692
00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:21.579
, we could have gone otherwise. So that's the

693
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.550
element of contingentism. Uh I define a particular brand

694
00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:30.958
of contingentism in the sense that um um um I'm

695
00:43:30.969 --> 00:43:34.280
not that kind of full blown contingent is in the

696
00:43:34.289 --> 00:43:36.769
sense that I don't think that things could have gone

697
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:42.099
entirely in a completely different way. Uh Precisely because

698
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.769
um the way I think a phenomena as a stable

699
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.139
event where stability is synonymous with low likeness means that

700
00:43:50.148 --> 00:43:54.280
the inferences that communities make about what phenomena goes with

701
00:43:54.289 --> 00:44:00.289
. What other phenomena are not fully at our discretion

702
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.320
, are not fully at our women in a way

703
00:44:01.329 --> 00:44:05.418
we need to respond to the Tribunal of Nature as

704
00:44:05.429 --> 00:44:07.090
a speaker, I find. So um There are

705
00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:10.969
a lot like dependencies that really guides those inferences that

706
00:44:10.978 --> 00:44:15.478
we make. Um So, uh uh and uh

707
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.418
and so I tell a story about how um every

708
00:44:20.429 --> 00:44:22.958
natural kind is a kind in the making. Uh

709
00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:27.228
some of those in the making kind become empty at

710
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.878
some point when we discovered that maybe there's some violation

711
00:44:30.889 --> 00:44:32.860
of fundamental laws. Uh So we believed in caloric

712
00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:35.840
, for example, back in the 19th century,

713
00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:37.550
people believed that there was a substance called caloric that

714
00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:43.688
was responsible for transitional state from ice to say water

715
00:44:43.699 --> 00:44:46.250
to, to steam. Um But some of the

716
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.369
uh inferences that people made about what are the phenomena

717
00:44:51.378 --> 00:44:54.329
that are captured by the Nashua Khan Caloric uh were

718
00:44:54.340 --> 00:45:00.280
clearly inferences that very soon revealed their limits. So

719
00:45:00.289 --> 00:45:04.148
um reveal their limits because very often they were appealing

720
00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:08.000
to um features of the phenomena that were simply false

721
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:12.519
. So, Sadiq Karno was one of the um

722
00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.010
key people in the uh formulation of the KO principles

723
00:45:16.019 --> 00:45:20.139
and the car cycle. So Ko believed in caloric

724
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.500
back in the first half of the 19th century.

725
00:45:22.898 --> 00:45:25.570
And he believed that there was a substance that was

726
00:45:25.579 --> 00:45:30.429
uh uh physically conserved whenever a hot reservoir goes into

727
00:45:30.438 --> 00:45:34.829
cold reservoir. And then a new cycle starts behind

728
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.699
like a steam engine. Uh but obviously, there

729
00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:39.860
is no conserve calor and there is no conservation of

730
00:45:39.869 --> 00:45:44.039
caloric and there is no perpetual motion machine and in

731
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.969
fact, can be created using that principle. So

732
00:45:45.978 --> 00:45:49.648
this is where we face the tribunal of experience where

733
00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:54.289
we can't say we could have had now in 2023

734
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:59.489
an Act kind caloric still alive. And well,

735
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.478
no, we couldn't have had that right, because

736
00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:06.019
we soon stumbled into some problems about some of those

737
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.574
very phenomena that were identified, identified as the phenomenon

738
00:46:08.583 --> 00:46:12.695
where caloric was, was at work. And uh

739
00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.684
and the fact that there was no conservation of caloric

740
00:46:14.695 --> 00:46:15.655
and if anything there was dissipation, which was then

741
00:46:15.664 --> 00:46:19.764
captured by the concept of entropy and so forth revealed

742
00:46:19.773 --> 00:46:22.144
the limits of those associations. So, so kind

743
00:46:22.155 --> 00:46:24.103
of long winded answer to your question, the contingentism

744
00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:29.394
means that although things could have gone otherwise in how

745
00:46:29.405 --> 00:46:32.695
communities came to make inferences about phenomenon connection between phenomena

746
00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:37.659
, things could not have gone entirely in a completely

747
00:46:37.668 --> 00:46:39.728
different ways because in a way, there are those

748
00:46:39.739 --> 00:46:45.769
constraints concerning low like dependencies of the phenomena that uh

749
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.929
really act as pointers in the garden of working path

750
00:46:50.938 --> 00:46:54.789
about which inferences we decide to go down to and

751
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.769
which inferences we decide to abandon at some point.

752
00:46:59.688 --> 00:47:02.250
I understand. So getting into the last part of

753
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.719
our interview, could you tell us now about multiculturalism

754
00:47:07.728 --> 00:47:10.329
and cosmo cosmopolitanism? Science? I mean, uh

755
00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:15.978
is science a multicultural and cosmopolitan enterprise? And what

756
00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:21.219
role do these two things? Multiculturalism and cosmopolitan,

757
00:47:21.369 --> 00:47:24.500
cosmopolitanism play in science? Yeah. No, thank

758
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:28.030
you. So this is the final chapter of the

759
00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:31.449
book and it's um um I wanted to write that

760
00:47:31.458 --> 00:47:35.878
chapter because um I, I thought the book was

761
00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:38.360
going to be complete without a final discussion about what

762
00:47:38.369 --> 00:47:45.500
really um questions about realism and perspective iss uh are

763
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.860
doing in, in this context. Um So very

764
00:47:47.869 --> 00:47:52.059
often in the debate on realism, philosophers have appealed

765
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.500
to the aims of science. So it seems that

766
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.250
, you know, we care about discussion about realism

767
00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.789
and the realism and truth and representation because we want

768
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.739
to fundamentally um answer questions about what is the goal

769
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:14.139
of science and what is the aim? Um And

770
00:48:14.148 --> 00:48:17.780
I thought that perspective of realism was not really answering

771
00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:21.260
that question about what the aim of goal of science

772
00:48:21.269 --> 00:48:24.860
is. Uh what perspective of realism does is to

773
00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:30.668
um offer a different lens for thinking about realism in

774
00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:35.820
science, starting with this plurality of situated communities.

775
00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:40.429
And once you take that step, the next step

776
00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:45.500
is to think of questions about duties and obligations in

777
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:49.159
science and rights in science. So no questions,

778
00:48:49.378 --> 00:48:53.228
aims and goals. But actually what is science for

779
00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:58.750
who produces science? Who has to benefit from science

780
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.849
, who can reclaim as their own a right to

781
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.599
benefit from scientific knowledge. So the first chapter in

782
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.050
a way, try to answer those, those questions

783
00:49:07.059 --> 00:49:12.679
which are kind of more um ethical political questions about

784
00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:15.300
duties and obligations in science. So, multiculturalism and

785
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:20.719
cosmopolitanism are again huge terms with a very long and

786
00:49:20.728 --> 00:49:23.219
often difficult and vexed history that I wanted to use

787
00:49:23.228 --> 00:49:30.099
to um exactly explain they, they called the natural

788
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.349
perspective of realism. Though it's, there's a perspective

789
00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:36.889
of pluralism that like there's multiculturalism, there's this plurality

790
00:49:36.898 --> 00:49:43.369
of historically situated communities that over time produce reliable knowledge

791
00:49:43.378 --> 00:49:47.829
about more robust phenomena. But also an invitation of

792
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.398
not thinking about that situated nature of knowledge as some

793
00:49:52.409 --> 00:49:58.119
kind of silo where knowledge is produced by community in

794
00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:00.360
isolation from other communities. Or you know, this

795
00:50:00.369 --> 00:50:04.030
is the um kind of picture that we had again

796
00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:05.739
from, you know, the the tradition of a

797
00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:08.510
Thomas K on scientific paradigms where there is incommensurability.

798
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:12.909
Um There's a period of crisis and scientific revolution.

799
00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.349
Uh And I, I wanted to offer a different

800
00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.550
story where it was really an invitation of not to

801
00:50:17.559 --> 00:50:23.280
think of scientific perspectives as siloed. Uh but to

802
00:50:23.289 --> 00:50:27.429
think of those communities and their interaction in terms of

803
00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:32.030
what I call intersecting and interlacing scientific perspectives, perspectives

804
00:50:32.039 --> 00:50:37.389
that over time, not only methodological intersect to allow

805
00:50:37.398 --> 00:50:39.309
us to make more reliable inferences about the phenomenon that

806
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.119
we want to study. But also over time,

807
00:50:43.128 --> 00:50:47.978
historically interlace like the um like in a fabric,

808
00:50:47.989 --> 00:50:50.469
like in a piece of cloth where you have the

809
00:50:50.478 --> 00:50:54.398
different threads that are historically interlaced uh to produce knowledge

810
00:50:54.409 --> 00:50:58.539
that effectively is knowledge that we can reclaim as,

811
00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.619
as, as knowledge that belong to all of us

812
00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:04.958
. And obviously that open up also the question questions

813
00:51:04.969 --> 00:51:07.559
about when is the interlacing virtues? When is the

814
00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:13.728
interlacing going badly wrong? Because there are exploitative practices

815
00:51:13.739 --> 00:51:16.360
or epistemic injustices in the way in which some communities

816
00:51:16.469 --> 00:51:22.559
appropriate other communities types of knowledge. So whose knowledge

817
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:23.469
is it? Who, who can be uh uh

818
00:51:23.478 --> 00:51:29.969
uh attributed authorship of particular uh knowledge claims? So

819
00:51:29.978 --> 00:51:31.530
those are all very big questions that I try to

820
00:51:31.539 --> 00:51:35.579
simply really map out in the final chapter and I

821
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.059
hope to get back to. But the idea is

822
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:43.300
that starting with this perspective of pluralism and multiculturalism,

823
00:51:43.938 --> 00:51:47.139
we can articulate a picture about scientific knowledge as reliable

824
00:51:47.148 --> 00:51:52.909
knowledge uh that has to address important epistemic injustice about

825
00:51:52.918 --> 00:51:55.059
what I call the severing and trademarking of knowledge.

826
00:51:55.659 --> 00:52:00.179
And at the same time, has to result in

827
00:52:00.188 --> 00:52:04.280
a broader picture of how knowledge is really knowledge produced

828
00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.458
by uh uh by humankind for humankind. So that

829
00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:13.099
no one should be excluded from benefiting from it and

830
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.378
benefiting from the advances of scientific knowledge. So it

831
00:52:15.389 --> 00:52:20.659
kind of branches out into debates about the uh right

832
00:52:20.668 --> 00:52:22.289
to science as a uh as a right that is

833
00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.409
enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human rights. So

834
00:52:25.418 --> 00:52:31.590
everyone is uh should benefit from um scientific progress and

835
00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:36.000
scientific advancement, but it's obviously not what happens in

836
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.829
practice. The scientific knowledge continues to be privatized,

837
00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.329
continues to be in the hands of um few wealthy

838
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.628
countries. So um as I said it as a

839
00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:47.250
final chapter that um I hope to get back to

840
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.530
in terms of my present and future work. But

841
00:52:51.539 --> 00:52:54.929
it kind of shows the broader um um kind of

842
00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:59.869
social political dimensions in which discussions about pluralism and perspective

843
00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:04.300
is and realism play out. And so my final

844
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:08.550
question for today will be, is science really about

845
00:53:08.559 --> 00:53:15.579
producing objective knowledge or knowing what objective reality is?

846
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.949
Yes, is the answer in so far as we

847
00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:22.699
are clear about what we mean by objective reality,

848
00:53:22.708 --> 00:53:27.590
right? So uh if objective reality means that there

849
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:30.019
is one way and one way only to uh carving

850
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.969
natural disjoint, I mean, that's not what perspective

851
00:53:32.978 --> 00:53:37.590
of realism would subscribe to. Uh but by objective

852
00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:40.309
reality, we mean that there is a world of

853
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.708
stable events, Koli events uh to which our uh

854
00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:50.340
multifarious inferential practices have to respond. That's, that's

855
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:52.329
objective enough. And so, yes, scientific knowledge

856
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:57.728
, knowledge of objective reality within the bounds of uh

857
00:53:57.739 --> 00:54:02.909
the historical and cultural situated practices that we have,

858
00:54:02.918 --> 00:54:05.449
we don't have any God's eye view, we don't

859
00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:07.148
have any view from nowhere. But that doesn't mean

860
00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:10.869
that what we have is just um a fragmented landscape

861
00:54:10.878 --> 00:54:15.349
of isolated communities. What we have is a fairly

862
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.320
remarkable uh knowledge produced over time by different communities.

863
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:22.800
And I think it's something that uh I wanted to

864
00:54:22.809 --> 00:54:24.309
celebrate in, in, in the book. And

865
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.119
uh as I said, it kind of opens up

866
00:54:27.128 --> 00:54:30.349
broader questions about um who produces knowledge and who should

867
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.789
benefit from knowledge that is entangled in my mind with

868
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.079
these questions about objective reality. Mhm. Great.

869
00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:42.260
So uh I'm leaving a link to the book in

870
00:54:42.269 --> 00:54:44.619
