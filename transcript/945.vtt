00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.150
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.010
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.369
today I'm joined by Doctor Christina Bio. She is

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.619
research program manager at Arizona State University co-founder and

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.780
co-director at the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center, a CE

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.399
Scholars program and co-founder and co-director of the co-operation

7
00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.889
Scholars Program. Her research interests include mentoring in higher

8
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.720
education, both undergraduate and graduate students, technology and higher

9
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.130
education barriers to student success such as food and

10
00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:41.540
housing insecurity and other topics. But these are the

11
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.209
ones we're going to focus on today. So, Doctor

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.490
Bachi, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.049
to everyone.

14
00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.310
Hi, Ricardo. Thank you so much for having me.

15
00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.669
It's a big pleasure to be here with you

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.169
today.

17
00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:58.150
So, uh talking about the work uh you're doing

18
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.709
on e mentoring. So could you tell us first

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.989
what kinds of mentoring FF mentoring fall under the

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.540
rubric of e mentoring? I mean, what kinds of

21
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.389
practices and technologies are we talking about here?

22
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.440
Yeah, absolutely. Um So, e mentoring is just a

23
00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:23.059
word that people use sometimes to refer to uh

24
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.430
practicing mentoring with the use of various technologies, right?

25
00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.690
We can um also find it under various other

26
00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:36.889
names um such as um um you know, um

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.239
online ment, mentoring, virtual mentoring, tele mentoring, cyber, mentoring,

28
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.010
so on and so forth. Um And basically, what

29
00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:49.889
it means is just refers um to um um

30
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.830
to using various computer um mediated um programs to

31
00:01:56.839 --> 00:02:03.199
um ensure interactions between say, usually two people. Traditionally,

32
00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.989
according to the traditional mentoring definitions, it would be

33
00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:10.720
uh perhaps a more experienced person who interacts with

34
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.029
the less experienced person who wants to learn something

35
00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.940
um to advance to advance their goals in some,

36
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:22.669
in some way. Um And so a mentor um

37
00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:27.440
really helps support the mentee by providing them with

38
00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:33.559
learning, advising, encouraging. Um AND modeling that is often,

39
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.100
I think particularly in the online environment, uh boundary

40
00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:42.910
list and hopefully egalitarian too. Um And so with

41
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.990
that, there are all kinds of um various e

42
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.630
mentoring opportunities these days. So for example, we could

43
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.339
see um 1 to 1 e mentoring where, you

44
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.059
know, two people interact online using various technologies or

45
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.110
platforms to build their e mentoring relationship. Um And,

46
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.199
and nurture it that way. Uh We could also

47
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.380
see group in mentoring opportunities where more people come

48
00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.600
together to interact, to learn from each other, maybe

49
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.070
to create community around some shared interests um and

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.490
um and grow their relationship that way. Um We

51
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.039
could see peer e mentoring where people who belong

52
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.050
to a certain group um are matched by um

53
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:43.330
some characteristics or interests or goals or knowledge uh

54
00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.199
to come together and help each other. Um So

55
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.729
th those are just a few examples of uh

56
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.529
of how that could work.

57
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.710
And of course you work in academia and uh

58
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.509
your work seems to be focused mostly on e

59
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.330
mentoring, e mentoring, applied to academia. But uh I

60
00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:07.570
would imagine that it applies to a variety of

61
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.669
contexts, right? And do you study e mentoring only

62
00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:17.230
uh in academia or also in those other contexts?

63
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:20.959
That's an excellent question. I do wanna study it

64
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.799
more broadly, but I haven't really done any work

65
00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.950
as of right now outside of academia. Um But,

66
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.600
you know, I think you can, one of the

67
00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:33.640
really great advantages of e mentoring is that you

68
00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:39.119
can take it and apply it to virtually probably

69
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.359
any context, right? Uh We certainly see a lot

70
00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.809
of it happening in academia or in education more

71
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.399
broadly speaking, it can apply to, you know, say

72
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.399
primary secondary schools, to high schools, to college students,

73
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.700
of course, to graduate students, um so on and

74
00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.899
so forth. Um But I think it can also

75
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.390
be applied and it is applied um uh broadly

76
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.119
speaking in the corporate world where companies use it

77
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.160
for all sorts of employee on boarding procedures, maybe

78
00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.000
or as part of employee training and professional development

79
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.279
opportunities um and so on and so forth. Um

80
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.644
I think it can also be, be used in

81
00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:31.375
the nonprofits, right? Um IN healthcare, in, in literally

82
00:05:31.385 --> 00:05:34.285
probably anything that we could think of any field

83
00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:38.035
or industry could um could use a mentoring to

84
00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:44.404
maybe help their people broadly speaking, um form a

85
00:05:44.415 --> 00:05:48.535
better connections, build community and just enable them to

86
00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:51.404
learn from each other and grow together.

87
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.359
And how long has the mentoring been applied to

88
00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.929
the academic context? I mean, how, how old is

89
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.850
uh are, are e mentoring practices within academy?

90
00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:08.790
Mhm That's an excellent question. Um Not that old

91
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:12.839
actually um because it relies on the use of

92
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.470
various technologies, right? So e mentoring evolved along with

93
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.630
uh various technologies such as internet and, and email,

94
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.369
for example. And so um I think e mentoring

95
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.609
started to be used as a tool in higher

96
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:35.350
education, for example, in about the 19 nineties um

97
00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:40.850
where I think the first online courses started to

98
00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:45.890
um to appear. And when that happened, professors used

99
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.859
e mentoring as a tool to kind of make

100
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.010
sure that their students are supported and get what

101
00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:53.859
they need in order to be able to be

102
00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:59.130
successful in their online courses. Um THEN fast forward

103
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.700
over the years. Um IN the two thousands, it

104
00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:07.989
al also continue to evolve, right? But particularly after

105
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.269
2010 15, again, the more technology developed and the

106
00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.000
more people in academia, right, the more students got

107
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.839
access to online education um and, and the more

108
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.519
universities started to offer various online degrees um than

109
00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:30.380
a kind of kept up the pace with that

110
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.170
growth um and was used more and more by

111
00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:38.570
universities and by professors to make sure that that

112
00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:42.519
the students in these online courses and programs are

113
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:46.170
successful. Um And even though this happened, and even

114
00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:50.450
though e mentoring definitely grew over the years, right,

115
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.179
it's debatable whether or not research really has kept

116
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.140
up with that and with really, you know, examining

117
00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:03.589
abroad, um a variety of factors that might say

118
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.190
influence the success of e mentoring relationships.

119
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.339
So we're going to get into some of the,

120
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.239
the details surrounding this. But does the online environment

121
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:21.230
change how teaching and learning uh is done and

122
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:21.859
occurs?

123
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.929
Great question. Um I, I think it does, right?

124
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.690
Um And I think it does for the better

125
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.070
for quite some time, there was a debate there

126
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.570
on whether or not, you know, online learning is

127
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.590
a thing that students can engage in successfully. Is

128
00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.679
it as valuable as a degree one would get

129
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.650
in person, you know, does it carry weight with

130
00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:54.344
employers? All these questions were um were um at

131
00:08:54.354 --> 00:08:58.455
people's um four minds for a while, right? And

132
00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:01.135
maybe there still are in some context, but I

133
00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:06.284
think the COVID-19 pandemic has largely influenced how people

134
00:09:06.294 --> 00:09:10.765
perceive online learning. Um And we definitely see now

135
00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:15.034
many, many more offerings for online programs and you

136
00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:18.965
know, college degrees, graduate degrees, you name it. Universities

137
00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:21.844
probably have it if people are interested in them,

138
00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:25.729
right? Um But to come back to your questions,

139
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:30.159
I I think definitely the online context does change

140
00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.849
or maybe influence a little bit teaching and learning

141
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.260
in the sense that um for one, for example,

142
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:43.250
it provides increased access to education broadly speaking. So

143
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.719
with the with online learning evolving over the years

144
00:09:46.729 --> 00:09:49.570
and all of these programs and degrees being available

145
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.674
all over the side, people who did not, could

146
00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:57.405
not access education before, perhaps due to, you know,

147
00:09:57.414 --> 00:10:00.164
say time constraints, maybe they have a full time

148
00:10:00.174 --> 00:10:03.375
job that they have to work on or um

149
00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:07.434
family responsibilities, they might be caregivers, they might have

150
00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:11.275
dependents, Children to take care of, they couldn't go

151
00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:15.554
to, to enroll in an in person degree, right?

152
00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:19.099
Because they simply could, didn't have the time and

153
00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:22.950
maybe resources to do so. Um But with online

154
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.000
education now they can do all those things on

155
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.020
their own terms on their own time. Um ONLINE

156
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.929
um teaching and learning is also great in that,

157
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.489
that it offers flexibility. Um Arguably both for learners

158
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.640
and for uh professors too, right? Um There is

159
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.094
a little bit more, more of a flexible environment

160
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:50.044
in terms of interactions. Um For students, for example,

161
00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:53.304
they can choose when to go in and watch

162
00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:56.924
the videos or complete the assignments uh based on,

163
00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:59.844
on their own availability, so on and so forth.

164
00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:04.890
Um I think it's also maybe important to mention

165
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.000
that um people, well, there is a debate actually

166
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.809
if people have different learning styles, uh we're not.

167
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.150
But, but for sure, I think we can say

168
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:18.755
that people might have different learning preferences. So, you

169
00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:22.354
know, some people might prefer to watch a video

170
00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:25.015
to learn about a concept or to hear somebody

171
00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:29.854
talking about that concept, right? Or um to um

172
00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:35.809
engage in various discussions with other um students, right?

173
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.450
To, to get a different opinion and whatnot. And

174
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.809
so online learning also pulls in all these different

175
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.400
threads um and brings them together so that students

176
00:11:45.409 --> 00:11:47.140
get a bit, a little bit of a well

177
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.469
rounded experience in terms of their learning preferences and

178
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:55.460
understanding of the various topics. Um

179
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.549
Yeah. No, go ahead, go ahead.

180
00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:00.549
I was gonna say that, you know what I've

181
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:03.280
been saying so far, it sounds really positive and

182
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.859
great and it is, right? But I think it's

183
00:12:05.869 --> 00:12:08.419
also important to acknowledge that there might be some

184
00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:12.400
things that are not necessarily as positive and as

185
00:12:12.409 --> 00:12:15.400
great. Um And one of those things would be,

186
00:12:15.409 --> 00:12:19.169
for example, um the digital divide, which is still

187
00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:21.580
very much a thing in the sense that not

188
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.539
everybody has equal access to um internet and to

189
00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:29.739
various technologies. And so yes, on one hand there,

190
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.559
we see an increased access to education, right? But

191
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.280
on the other hand, there are still people who

192
00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:39.739
cannot access it because there is just not um

193
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.340
there is just not uh they don't have access

194
00:12:42.349 --> 00:12:44.979
to the technology, they would need it to be

195
00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:48.950
successful in the first place. Um Some people also

196
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.880
might prefer the face to face interaction with their

197
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.159
professors, right? And some people might feel like it's

198
00:12:56.169 --> 00:12:59.219
easier to build a relationship with their professor if

199
00:12:59.229 --> 00:13:02.200
they go to classes twice a week or once

200
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.640
a week. Right. And you get to, to talk

201
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.520
to somebody in, in uh in person um as

202
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.340
opposed to doing it online. Um And then, you

203
00:13:12.349 --> 00:13:14.969
know, like we were talking um before we started

204
00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:19.659
to record, sometimes you might encounter technology issues. Um

205
00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:23.099
And you know, you might need to join a

206
00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:27.484
call for class, but your internet provider uh or

207
00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:29.984
connection is down for the day. So, so you

208
00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:32.385
can't do that. So, you know, I just wanted

209
00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.515
to say that there are a lot of places

210
00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:37.625
and there are also some things that can be

211
00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:40.734
issues. Sometimes that we might need to be mindful

212
00:13:40.744 --> 00:13:41.184
of

213
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.690
and to teachers and professors themselves have to adapt

214
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.739
the way they teach in online environments. I mean,

215
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.359
and I'm here, I'm not talking specifically about, for

216
00:13:54.369 --> 00:13:58.849
example, back in 2020 when COVID hit uh at

217
00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:01.380
a certain point, I mean, I noticed this because

218
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.979
uh since I am in regular contact with academics,

219
00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:08.789
I had to reschedule a few interviews because people

220
00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:14.349
were extremely busy moving materials online and adapting to

221
00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:18.070
new technologies like Zoom, for example. Uh uh But

222
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.900
I'm not talking about that uh adaptation and moving

223
00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:24.390
materials online and that kind of thing, I'm talking

224
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.619
more about the way they transmit information, the way

225
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.580
they teach, does it change in online environments?

226
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.080
Excellent question. Um I think it does to some

227
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.070
extent, right? Um So I guess for example, one

228
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.479
thing that comes to mind is that when we

229
00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:49.719
teach online, we gotta make sure that we design

230
00:14:49.729 --> 00:14:56.840
online friendly material for students to engage with. Right?

231
00:14:56.849 --> 00:14:59.719
And so what does that mean? That means that

232
00:14:59.729 --> 00:15:04.010
if we assign, you know, a really long piece

233
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.359
of material, audio video, whatever to a student to

234
00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:11.289
listen or watch, they might or might not do

235
00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:13.030
it. I think it depends from a student to

236
00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:16.119
another in their preferences. But in general, there is,

237
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.219
you know, research out there on how, you know,

238
00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:23.539
cognitive overload and you know, our attention spans are

239
00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:26.729
not getting longer but shorter, right? And so with

240
00:15:26.739 --> 00:15:28.919
those kinds of things in mind, I think it's

241
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:34.090
important to uh maybe, you know, create um shorter,

242
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:39.250
more digestible content for students to engage with um

243
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.919
using a variety of multimedia and various online tools

244
00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:47.489
that keep students engaged and active with the material.

245
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.750
Um And I think this is particularly important because

246
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.900
because motivation and showing up every day to do

247
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:58.659
online work is a big factor in the success

248
00:15:58.669 --> 00:16:01.659
of online learning, right? And, and, and I feel

249
00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:07.219
like if students don't have fun, engaging things to

250
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.099
come to every single time they, then they might

251
00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:14.369
not be as motivated to do those things to

252
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.000
come back to engage, to do well in the

253
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:24.820
course. Um Let's see, what else? Um I think,

254
00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:29.260
I think, um I think that communicating and, and

255
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.700
building community is also really important um in online

256
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.929
learning. And what I mean by that is um

257
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.539
you know, maintaining regular communication with students, um creating

258
00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:45.994
the of presence of, we're here together, we're here

259
00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.924
to learn, we're uh you know, we, we can

260
00:16:48.934 --> 00:16:51.755
do pretty much a lot of the things that

261
00:16:51.765 --> 00:16:54.234
we can do in person, I think, right? Like

262
00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:57.525
learn from each other, listen to each other's stories

263
00:16:57.534 --> 00:17:02.119
and inputs and insights, right? Um GROW together, um

264
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:07.069
create opportunities for feedback and for discussion. Um THOSE

265
00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.189
things, those kinds of things are really important. Um

266
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:12.709
I believe for educators to do in order to

267
00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:16.750
create an effective um online learning environment.

268
00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.708
So I would like to ask you now if

269
00:17:20.718 --> 00:17:25.808
we know what predicts the success of e mentoring,

270
00:17:25.818 --> 00:17:29.139
I mean, does it depend for example, on any

271
00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:33.139
specific individual traits of students?

272
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:40.349
That's a great question. Um There, particularly after the

273
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:43.650
COVID-19 pandemic, but even before there were, there were

274
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.369
studies out there looking to understand, you know, what

275
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.069
exactly the factors or traits of students might be

276
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.829
um that would predict the success of a knee

277
00:17:55.839 --> 00:18:00.410
mentoring relationship. And so, um I can get to

278
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.369
that in a second in terms of my own

279
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.239
work. But before I do that, just in general,

280
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.040
um there are, you know, some, some things in

281
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.920
the literature, like um a commitment, you know, students

282
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:18.630
commitment um to um to mentoring to their own

283
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.119
goals, right? Might influence the ways in which they

284
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.709
show up and engage in that particular mentoring relationship.

285
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.040
Um Communication is also very, very important. You cannot

286
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.880
have a successful mentoring relationship if you're not there

287
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:39.839
to communicate effectively and timely with your mentor, right?

288
00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:44.300
Um And so are clear goals and expectations. So

289
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.859
it's really important that everybody, you know, both the

290
00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:52.130
mentor and the mentee really knows what the goals

291
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.859
and expectations are so that they're able to um

292
00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.869
to build backwards almost from there, right? So the

293
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.442
mentor or probably any mentor actually who engages in

294
00:19:04.453 --> 00:19:07.272
a, in a mentoring relationship will initially have a

295
00:19:07.282 --> 00:19:11.003
conversation with their mentee where they really get to,

296
00:19:11.012 --> 00:19:12.902
you know, the people get to know each other.

297
00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:16.282
Um And the mentor really asks the mentee about

298
00:19:16.292 --> 00:19:21.233
their goals um and, and future plans, right? And

299
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.706
then with that in, find the mentors job for

300
00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:27.406
the most part is to kinda like backtrack and

301
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:30.446
see how can they help the mentee get to

302
00:19:30.456 --> 00:19:34.005
this distant point or more distant point in time

303
00:19:34.015 --> 00:19:37.456
to accomplish their goals. Um They established a set

304
00:19:37.465 --> 00:19:40.426
of steps maybe um that they can work on

305
00:19:40.436 --> 00:19:44.540
together so that the mentee can get there. Um

306
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.869
Another thing that we see is important in the

307
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.180
literature is cultural and emotional intelligence. So it's important

308
00:19:52.189 --> 00:19:55.339
for people to, you know, to be able to

309
00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:58.430
be aware, we're all different people, we all coming

310
00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:01.579
from different backgrounds. And so I think it's important

311
00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:04.680
to have an awareness and appreciation for that so

312
00:20:04.689 --> 00:20:07.829
that we can really, you know, um have rich

313
00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:14.750
conversations and, and learn from each other. Um And

314
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.160
then, you know, there is like other more technical

315
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.040
uh the things like the mentors, skills and knowledge,

316
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.170
like you would have to make sure that a

317
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.390
mentor, you know, is, is, is appropriate that the

318
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.969
pairing I should say is appropriate because not every

319
00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.609
mentor is gonna be good for every mentee and

320
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:35.650
the other way around, people need to have some

321
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.910
things in common. Um Right, in order to ensure

322
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.349
that they have um a, a mutually beneficial mentoring

323
00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:45.359
relationship.

324
00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.640
Uh And so I, I, in what ways do

325
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.250
perceptions that students have of particular aspects of e

326
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.530
mentoring matter here? So, for example, uh role modeling

327
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.069
and psychological and emotional support. And I would imagine

328
00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:08.640
when it comes to role modeling, uh specifically having

329
00:21:08.849 --> 00:21:13.160
uh mentors who are of the same gender, for

330
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.300
example. So, uh how does that work?

331
00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:22.060
Yeah, that's an excellent question. So, um in, in

332
00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:27.130
my dissertation work, um I looked to um understand

333
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:33.239
how online students um it perceive and engage with

334
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.160
e mentoring. Um And so, in doing so, um

335
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.020
um I examined a couple of different factors or

336
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.880
traits um of students such as gender, age, digital

337
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:51.260
competence, um social self efficacy and goal orientation. And

338
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.900
I looked specifically at seeing how these things map

339
00:21:54.910 --> 00:22:03.260
onto um students perceptions of psychological and emotional support,

340
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.836
um degree and career support, academic knowledge support and

341
00:22:08.845 --> 00:22:11.686
role modeling that you just mentioned. And so all

342
00:22:11.696 --> 00:22:14.926
these things, psychological and emotional support, degree and career

343
00:22:14.936 --> 00:22:18.286
support, academic knowledge support and role modeling are part

344
00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:22.076
of um of um um somebody else's research. Um

345
00:22:22.086 --> 00:22:25.465
uh Her name is Doctor Gloria Crisp. And she

346
00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:29.005
created this um thing that she calls the co

347
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:33.791
college student mentoring scale. Um That was I think

348
00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:38.771
first published in about 2009 or so. Um And

349
00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:42.911
so that's a widely used scale in mentoring to

350
00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:48.131
try to understand how various traits again, influenced, say

351
00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:51.332
in our case, students perceptions of all these different

352
00:22:51.342 --> 00:22:55.800
areas of e mentoring, right? Um And so with

353
00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:01.359
role modeling, you, like you were asking um in

354
00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:03.949
my own work, I have to like browse through

355
00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:07.170
my brain really quickly uh in my own work,

356
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.469
I found that um when it comes to role

357
00:23:10.479 --> 00:23:14.410
modeling in particular age and gender, do not really

358
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.670
um inf influence play any role, right? Um INTO

359
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.119
it. But, but digital competence, goal orientation and social

360
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:28.020
self efficacy do. Um SO, in fact, if I

361
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:33.329
remember correctly, I think social self efficacy only influenced

362
00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:38.290
students perceptions of role modeling and not their and,

363
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.030
and did not um influence their perceptions of psychological

364
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.310
and emotional support, degree and career support and academic

365
00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:48.300
knowledge support. Um And, you know, that may be

366
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.849
the case because um say students who have higher

367
00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:58.380
levels of social self efficacy um are maybe, you

368
00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.359
know, more inclined to um to look up to

369
00:24:01.369 --> 00:24:04.150
their mentors, to interact, more with them, to want

370
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.630
to be more like them if that makes sense,

371
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.770
right? Um And to be more receptive um um

372
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.140
in that relationship.

373
00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:18.500
Uh And what about uh future engagement with e

374
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.160
mentoring opportunities? So, if people have already engaged with

375
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.530
uh e mentoring, uh what predicts if they in

376
00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.699
the future will do it again? Uh I mean,

377
00:24:31.709 --> 00:24:35.760
if they were satisfied with enough with the experience

378
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.900
and they will and will want to have it

379
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.939
or try it again.

380
00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:44.599
Mhm Yeah. So um again, in, in my work,

381
00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:49.859
um um I did not see contrary to expectations

382
00:24:49.869 --> 00:24:53.089
and to what previous research indicates I did not

383
00:24:53.099 --> 00:24:57.569
find that age or gender had any influence on

384
00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:04.685
um online students um likelihood to engage with future

385
00:25:04.895 --> 00:25:08.685
e mentoring opportunities. Be they formal or informal? Uh

386
00:25:08.694 --> 00:25:10.875
By the way, we looked at both these things

387
00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:13.275
to see whether there would be a difference in

388
00:25:13.285 --> 00:25:17.935
terms of um formal versus informal um e mentoring

389
00:25:17.944 --> 00:25:22.579
programs. And there was not um however, digital competence

390
00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:27.770
and goal orientation were the most significant predictors of

391
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.239
students um interest to potentially engage in both formal

392
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.680
and informal mentoring opportunities in the future. And that's

393
00:25:37.689 --> 00:25:41.469
no big surprise, right? Um When we say digital

394
00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:44.670
competence, by the way, we mean just a student

395
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.560
skills to um to effectively gather information, online, engage

396
00:25:50.569 --> 00:25:55.469
with all these different um technologies um excuse me,

397
00:25:56.089 --> 00:25:59.060
um and, and be able to use them effectively,

398
00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:05.010
right? Um And on a side note, because particularly

399
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.939
with younger students, we have, you know, been growing

400
00:26:07.949 --> 00:26:12.810
up through all these technology developments, sometimes in higher

401
00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:16.250
education, we tend to assume that these students who

402
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.939
are also known as the digital natives would be

403
00:26:19.949 --> 00:26:24.170
absolutely comfortable um with all these tools. And, you

404
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.989
know, we assume that they are say, for example,

405
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.030
highly skilled in things like digital competence, but sometimes

406
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.689
that's not the best assumption to make because, you

407
00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:37.989
know, just because somebody grew up with these tools

408
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.839
does not necessarily mean that they know how to

409
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:44.420
use every technology effectively or how to bring them

410
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.239
all together and so on and so forth, right?

411
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.300
So I think it's important to, you know, just

412
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.099
to throw a little caution uh there and, and

413
00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:58.260
make sure that, you know, maybe we conduct assessments,

414
00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.260
um if we have say e mentoring programs, right,

415
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.599
to kinda see where the students are at, um

416
00:27:04.609 --> 00:27:06.969
where the professors are at because they're not no

417
00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:10.239
exception either, you know, sometimes the professors are also

418
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.099
assumed to be really digitally competent and perhaps that's

419
00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:17.390
not necessarily the case um since there are so

420
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.400
many tools out there and we cannot possibly know

421
00:27:20.729 --> 00:27:22.760
every single one of them. Right.

422
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.540
Yeah. And also I would imagine that even for

423
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.219
the younger people who have been exposed to these

424
00:27:31.229 --> 00:27:34.469
newer technologies for a longer period of time, I

425
00:27:34.479 --> 00:27:38.510
mean, since new ones are coming around all the

426
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.979
time, uh perhaps we also shouldn't assume that they

427
00:27:42.989 --> 00:27:46.640
are familiar with all of them because that's, I

428
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.869
would imagine virtually impossible.

429
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.219
Absolutely. Yes. And then remember we talked about the

430
00:27:52.229 --> 00:27:55.410
digital divide a few moments ago. So that's a

431
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.079
whole other thing. And, you know, particularly for students

432
00:27:58.089 --> 00:28:01.300
coming from rural, rural, that's a hard word to

433
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:08.650
pronounce rural environments. Um WHO did not necessarily not

434
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.239
even have access to all these technologies as they

435
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.689
were growing up or the internet connection, right? Um

436
00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:16.969
JU uh just assuming that they would be digitally

437
00:28:16.979 --> 00:28:20.140
competent would be a huge, huge mistake and lost

438
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:24.300
opportunity. And actually, you know, us helping them get

439
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.250
to the point where they are comfortable using um

440
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.339
using all these tools successfully.

441
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.359
So I think we've been sort of alluding to

442
00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:38.449
this throughout the interview, but just perhaps to sum

443
00:28:38.459 --> 00:28:41.199
things up a little bit, what would you say

444
00:28:41.209 --> 00:28:45.189
are some of the advantages and disadvantages of e

445
00:28:45.239 --> 00:28:51.380
mentoring compared to some more traditional forms of mentoring?

446
00:28:52.579 --> 00:28:58.589
Hm, that is an excellent question. Um And one

447
00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:00.829
of my favorites when I talk about e mentoring

448
00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:05.030
actually. So, um yeah, we alluded to these things

449
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.050
a little bit. But I think, you know, in

450
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.900
terms of advantages, um one of um one of

451
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.020
the biggest advantages I think um from um e

452
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:21.260
mentoring um a awarding this really huge geographic flexibility.

453
00:29:21.469 --> 00:29:27.089
So with traditional mentoring relationships, often time times people

454
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:31.140
would be um uh location bound, right? You had

455
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.109
to be at the same school, you had to

456
00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.069
be at the same company, you had to be

457
00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:39.709
in the same location. But with e mentoring, virtually,

458
00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:43.589
you can, you know, reach as far as you

459
00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:46.349
want, right? And find the people you would want

460
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:49.739
to connect with um no matter where they are

461
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.670
in the world um and reach out to them

462
00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.550
and, you know, kinda kinda see what happens, right.

463
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.300
Mhm. Um So that's huge and that, that's also

464
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.630
really, really important because um it um it brings

465
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.869
up new opportunities for people who maybe would not

466
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.589
have had such opportunities before. So, for example, again,

467
00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:16.520
going back to online students, for example, um who,

468
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.589
you know, maybe are full time workers and parents

469
00:30:19.824 --> 00:30:23.135
and all these things, um it's unlikely that they

470
00:30:23.145 --> 00:30:27.944
could have, you know, had in-person mentors. But again,

471
00:30:27.954 --> 00:30:31.555
with e mentoring now they can engage with people

472
00:30:31.564 --> 00:30:36.155
and, and build these connections um which can come

473
00:30:36.165 --> 00:30:39.185
with really, really great benefits. So, you know, for

474
00:30:39.194 --> 00:30:42.234
example, for women, um and people who are coming

475
00:30:42.244 --> 00:30:48.829
from um traditionally underrepresented backgrounds, um E mentoring is

476
00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:52.560
really, really important because it can help them, you

477
00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:55.760
know, be more connected. Um THEY have a broader

478
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.920
network which will maybe lead to more opportunities. Um

479
00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.270
It can shape their interest in graduate school and

480
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.464
various careers that they would not, that maybe have

481
00:31:06.474 --> 00:31:10.474
thought of otherwise because, you know, somebody like me

482
00:31:10.484 --> 00:31:13.405
does not necessarily go there because I did not

483
00:31:13.415 --> 00:31:16.035
have a role model, right? And I didn't know

484
00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:18.175
that that's possible for me. So we see that

485
00:31:18.185 --> 00:31:23.064
we have countless examples throughout um the mentoring, the

486
00:31:23.074 --> 00:31:25.935
e mentoring programs um that I'm involved with, for

487
00:31:25.944 --> 00:31:32.770
example, um Then another big advantage I think comes

488
00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.000
from um from the flexibility, kinda hinted to this

489
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.839
already from the flexibility that people have, you know,

490
00:31:39.849 --> 00:31:42.300
we can work around our schedules, we can find

491
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.819
a time that works for everybody, right? Um And

492
00:31:45.829 --> 00:31:51.300
we can make this um this relationship happen. Um

493
00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:54.630
Maybe it's also important to mention that with e

494
00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.800
mentoring, um we can keep track of conversations, maybe

495
00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:04.589
document conversations, right? So if, if our meeting today

496
00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:08.510
say was um uh was an e mentoring meeting,

497
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.390
then we could record it and, and you know,

498
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.119
me as the mentee, I could then go and

499
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.900
look at the recording transcript on my own later

500
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.729
on. If I wanted to reference something to remember

501
00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.589
something, you know, to go do some research on

502
00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:26.849
some resources, maybe reference so on and so forth,

503
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:29.670
right? So it would be easier from that point

504
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.729
of view too. Um Then in terms of um

505
00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:40.459
of disadvantages, um like I mentioned before, some people

506
00:32:40.469 --> 00:32:44.260
might feel a lack of personal connection with e

507
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:50.140
mentoring. Um BECAUSE, you know, for various reasons, some

508
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.780
people might prefer to meet in person, some people

509
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.430
might feel like it's more difficult to, to really

510
00:32:55.439 --> 00:33:00.689
build genuine relationships online, right? Um And they might

511
00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:04.910
really be feeling like they miss on those personal

512
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:10.569
interactions, um technical difficulties, right? We mentioned that already

513
00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:12.969
those can happen too and they are no fun.

514
00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:17.800
Um There could be some privacy concerns in terms

515
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:22.660
of, you know, data sharing and stuff with various

516
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:26.780
software recording, you know, people's email addresses and, and,

517
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.709
and phone numbers and whatnot. But, you know, I

518
00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:31.420
would argue that these are no different than, you

519
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.829
know, the information that's being collected when you sign

520
00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:38.619
up for, you know, a new grocery store newsletter

521
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.060
or whatever, right? Something that you would do maybe

522
00:33:41.069 --> 00:33:47.069
anyways. Um AND then, um I guess sometimes there

523
00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:48.969
can be this a little bit of a disconnection

524
00:33:48.979 --> 00:33:53.130
in terms of delayed responses. So if we communicate

525
00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.150
via email, for example, you know, the conversation does

526
00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.619
not quite happen in real time. Um There is

527
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.489
a little bit of a delay between uh what

528
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.660
I send what I receive, you know, um A

529
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:11.320
and maybe, maybe that's problematic for some people. Um

530
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.800
But again, I, for me personally, I feel like

531
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.208
these things are can be easily or somewhat, at

532
00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:21.320
least easily addressed. Um And I think that the

533
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:28.510
advantages um are far, far um beyond the disadvantages

534
00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.080
for a mentoring.

535
00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.020
Uh By the way earlier, uh you've already mentioned,

536
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.409
you've mentioned uh COVID-19. Uh So what impact did

537
00:34:40.418 --> 00:34:44.149
the pandemic have on e mentoring and out with

538
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:44.918
this study,

539
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.320
it had a great impact um like you did

540
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.659
on, on online education really. But, but with e

541
00:34:54.668 --> 00:34:57.639
mentoring too, um you know, I started my doctoral

542
00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:04.169
program in May of 2020 when, when the pandemic

543
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:08.469
uh was very much a thing, right? Um And

544
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:12.919
I finished my doctoral program throughout the pandemic. And

545
00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:15.030
I think I only went to school in person

546
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.419
maybe like three times. Um Otherwise all of my

547
00:35:19.429 --> 00:35:22.709
classes are online, all of my meetings with my

548
00:35:22.719 --> 00:35:27.580
colleagues, with my advisors, everything. Um And it was

549
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.879
great, I loved it, it worked really well for

550
00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:32.989
me. Um But at the same time, I had

551
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.260
decided that I really early on in 2020 that

552
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.760
I will focus my dissertation on e mentoring. So

553
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.459
I kept a really close eye on how the

554
00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:47.989
field was developing, right? Um And so, so I've

555
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.340
seen a lot of great papers come out throughout

556
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.709
the pandemic. Um And, and many of them really

557
00:35:54.719 --> 00:36:00.659
focused on understanding um how the pandemic is impacting

558
00:36:00.669 --> 00:36:03.989
students and e mentoring, you know, are they are

559
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.120
students more likely to engage in e mentoring that

560
00:36:07.129 --> 00:36:12.219
they would have been before? Absolutely, yes. Um Are

561
00:36:12.229 --> 00:36:15.989
they drawing benefits from being engaged in e mentoring

562
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.409
during the pandemic. Absolutely yes. Again and so some

563
00:36:20.419 --> 00:36:23.330
of those benefits would be things like, you know,

564
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.679
there has been papers who um who uh were

565
00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:31.669
authors who have found that students who were engaged

566
00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:37.120
in e mentoring relationships during the pandemic reported significantly

567
00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:41.520
less anxiety and depression, for example. And compared to

568
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.500
people who are not engaged in e mentoring and

569
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.689
overall just better, just better mental health. Um They

570
00:36:48.699 --> 00:36:52.979
felt um they were, they indicated um that they

571
00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:57.580
felt higher rates of belonging and inclusiveness, which is

572
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.510
really important, particularly during the pandemic when you know,

573
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.500
everybody's world was kind of shattered and rearranged in

574
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:10.969
some way, right? Um And just like before, um

575
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:14.250
before the pandemic, pretty much, you know, the results

576
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.379
were consistent um showing that students were engaged in

577
00:37:18.389 --> 00:37:23.070
e mentoring, had overall better grades, better GPA S

578
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:29.959
um better access to various network um um opportunities

579
00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:33.290
um a larger social capital. So they knew more

580
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.800
people that they could uh go to when they

581
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:39.000
needed help um and so on and so forth.

582
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:43.239
So, so yes, the pandemic really influenced how much

583
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:47.020
people were actually focusing on e mentoring, both as

584
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.479
a practice and as a field of study.

585
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.110
So do you think that the work you and

586
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.800
other people are doing on e mentoring, how it

587
00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.639
works when it works with whom it works, et

588
00:38:02.649 --> 00:38:07.790
cetera, it can help uh mentors and educators design

589
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.040
e mentoring opportunities.

590
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:16.989
I certainly hope so. Yeah, and I, I surely

591
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.320
hope so so. You know, one of the big

592
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.399
um I think from my perspective, there is like

593
00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:27.290
two main messages that I would put out there,

594
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.169
right? One has to do with digital competence and

595
00:38:31.179 --> 00:38:35.169
it's important for e mentoring and more broadly for

596
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:39.100
online learning. Um I think it's really, really important

597
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:43.449
to uh you know, to run assessments of digital

598
00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:47.449
competence, both for students and for T teachers um

599
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:52.100
and professors and to really develop training um modules

600
00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.050
and various other, you know, provide various other support

601
00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:01.100
opportunities for them to help them um develop this

602
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.610
skill further and further. And I think that it's

603
00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.129
not, there is not gonna be a point where

604
00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:08.570
we're gonna say, OK, you have a lot of

605
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.479
digital competence and you can stop. Um I don't

606
00:39:12.489 --> 00:39:16.479
think we're gonna get there because technology advances, like

607
00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:19.729
we said, you know, so at, at such a

608
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:24.149
fast rate, right these days um that we, you

609
00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:26.590
know, we have to keep learning and we have

610
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.179
to keep improving our skills um in order to

611
00:39:30.189 --> 00:39:34.070
be effective teachers and learners and mentors and new

612
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.929
mentors and so on and so forth. Um And

613
00:39:37.939 --> 00:39:41.040
another thing I wanna mention from my personal experience

614
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.120
um as the co-founder and co-director of the A

615
00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:48.239
Scholars program um and the Corporation Scholars Program and

616
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.649
all the other mentoring programs we're running at A

617
00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:58.030
SU um is that I think community is really

618
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.709
really important when it comes to e mentoring. So

619
00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:06.139
building community and nurturing community with students is going

620
00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:08.449
to be crucial for the success of any e

621
00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:12.000
mentoring opportunity. And what I mean by community is

622
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:16.040
really nothing fancy, right? What I mean is just

623
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:22.530
creating this welcoming environment where students know that they

624
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.129
are appreciated for who they are, where we treat

625
00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:29.889
students from an what we call in higher education,

626
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:35.199
an asset based perspective rather than a deficit perspective.

627
00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.875
So in a deficit perspective, we say, oh, students

628
00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:41.915
are not good at math. Um And therefore we're

629
00:40:41.925 --> 00:40:44.604
gonna do this to fix it. Whereas in an

630
00:40:44.614 --> 00:40:49.264
asset perspective, we say, oh you know, they're great

631
00:40:49.274 --> 00:40:52.625
at multiplication. This is a silly example, right? So

632
00:40:52.635 --> 00:40:55.024
we're gonna focus on that and building the skills

633
00:40:55.034 --> 00:40:57.284
that they're good at to kind of like help

634
00:40:57.294 --> 00:41:02.179
build everything and carry it on, right? Um So

635
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.159
in our own experience, we find that when we

636
00:41:05.169 --> 00:41:09.239
encourage students to bring their whole selves to school,

637
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.199
right? In this case, and to work too, I

638
00:41:11.209 --> 00:41:15.219
would argue and just create this environment where um

639
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.350
you know, it's uh warm and welcoming and really

640
00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.975
appreciating of everybody's backgrounds and interests. Um THEN people

641
00:41:23.985 --> 00:41:27.034
are more likely to engage, they start to share

642
00:41:27.044 --> 00:41:30.524
various stories and experiences, they realize that they are

643
00:41:30.534 --> 00:41:35.324
more alike than not, right? Um And this really

644
00:41:35.334 --> 00:41:38.514
great thing happens where everybody learns from each other

645
00:41:38.524 --> 00:41:42.544
and we grow together as a community of scholars

646
00:41:42.554 --> 00:41:44.104
in this particular example.

647
00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.989
So, uh that's about e mentoring. Uh I have

648
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.500
one last question slash topic I would like to

649
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.919
explore here. So I know you're also interested in

650
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:02.250
uh barriers to student success. So, uh what have

651
00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.439
you studied in that regard? And which do you

652
00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:10.189
think are some of the biggest barriers here?

653
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:15.649
Mhm. That's, that's an excellent question. Um And an

654
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:19.239
unfortunate topic that we have to be aware of

655
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.870
in higher education, I think. Um, IT was quite

656
00:42:22.879 --> 00:42:25.770
a few years ago, maybe during my master's program.

657
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.770
So, so quite a few years ago when I

658
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:33.409
learned about this thing called basic needs insecurity, um

659
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.929
and basically means insecurity is an umbrella term that

660
00:42:36.939 --> 00:42:42.570
basically, um, is composed of or refers to um

661
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:48.030
food insecurity, um housing insecurity, um and things of

662
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.909
that nature, right? That students um could experience that

663
00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:56.489
will most definitely prevent them from being successful um,

664
00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.159
in their educational endeavors, right? Um, THERE have been

665
00:43:01.169 --> 00:43:04.250
quite a few researchers over the years who have

666
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.020
looked um at these things. Um, THERE, there is

667
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.250
this big group that's based um out of the

668
00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:14.679
Temple University now. Um, IT'S called the Hope Center.

669
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.860
Um, AND they do a lot of work on

670
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.790
basic need and security and, um, you know, they

671
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.520
try to survey nationally representative samples across the United

672
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.469
States and for the past few years, they have

673
00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:32.500
consistently found that as much as 45% of the

674
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:38.379
undergraduate student population um experienced some sort of food

675
00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:43.810
insecurity at some point during their college experience. Um

676
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.260
And, and that's a huge problem because you cannot

677
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.800
learn and you cannot be successful in school when

678
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:54.500
you are hungry, right? Um And when you don't

679
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.459
know where your next meal might be coming from,

680
00:43:57.889 --> 00:44:01.010
um, in the, in the same line of work,

681
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.979
they also looked at um students who are experiencing

682
00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:08.129
housing insecurity and homelessness and they define these things,

683
00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:10.629
they put them into two different categories, I think.

684
00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:17.429
So, um housing insecurity is when um people have

685
00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:21.429
temporary issues with housing. So they might, you know,

686
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:25.629
um go um crash on somebody's couch for two

687
00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:29.860
weeks that would be housing insecurity or they have,

688
00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:33.915
you know, um eight roommates uh within two bedrooms.

689
00:44:33.925 --> 00:44:37.554
That's also not ideal, right? Um And homelessness, it's

690
00:44:37.564 --> 00:44:39.814
quite obvious, you know, you, you don't, you just

691
00:44:39.824 --> 00:44:44.205
don't have a place to live um for housing

692
00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:48.820
insecurity again, a huge proportion of students up to

693
00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.560
20% or so if I remember correctly, um reported

694
00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.639
having experienced that at times and about 10% or

695
00:44:55.649 --> 00:45:00.810
so of students reported experiencing uh homelessness um at

696
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:06.070
times while being in school. Um So those are

697
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:10.600
obviously really great issues that students are dealing with.

698
00:45:10.929 --> 00:45:14.199
Um And you know, if the basic needs are

699
00:45:14.209 --> 00:45:17.699
not covered then then people just cannot be successful

700
00:45:17.709 --> 00:45:22.360
period in school work or otherwise. Um And so

701
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:27.199
over the years, we've seen an increase of universities

702
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.719
um and colleges across the country really, you know,

703
00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:34.469
working to uh to start to address these issues.

704
00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:39.739
So for example, um universities have built um and

705
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.969
are supporting um having pantries on campus where students

706
00:45:44.979 --> 00:45:47.909
can go pick up some food every now and

707
00:45:47.919 --> 00:45:50.709
then and just, you know, more in general, maybe

708
00:45:50.719 --> 00:45:55.959
connect students with various resources that they need. Um

709
00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:58.679
From here on in general, I would go and

710
00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:02.459
say that there is just broadly speaking, a bunch

711
00:46:02.469 --> 00:46:07.169
of uh financial constraints that students could experience that

712
00:46:07.179 --> 00:46:13.040
could really impact their success um in higher education.

713
00:46:13.439 --> 00:46:16.489
So, you know, with that again, um we know

714
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.550
that an ex an unexpected expense of um of

715
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.969
$500. No more, no less, right? I mean, maybe

716
00:46:24.979 --> 00:46:29.669
less, maybe more. Um BUT just in average something

717
00:46:29.679 --> 00:46:32.300
like $500 that comes out of nowhere that a

718
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.590
student needs to cover for a car uh repair

719
00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:40.699
or something like that can really derail their education

720
00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:43.830
because they might not be able to cover tuition.

721
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.570
And if you did not pay your full tuition

722
00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.310
by the end of the semester, you will not

723
00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.540
be able to enroll in classes for the next

724
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.320
semester. Now, you have a hold on your account,

725
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.439
then you have some more fees added on top

726
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:58.389
of that. Right. Then things can snowball really quickly.

727
00:46:58.739 --> 00:47:01.850
And so with that universities have started to create

728
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.770
um these emergency funds, they call them where students

729
00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:12.280
can apply for um for financial um aid um

730
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:17.879
to cover an emergency that they um had. Um

731
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.360
THOSE are, you know, great initiatives to help students

732
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:26.570
succeed. Um And probably we could, we could do

733
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.949
even better in terms of being more responsive and,

734
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:34.350
and helping students more timely with these kinds of

735
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.929
things and, you know, having really streamlined processes. So,

736
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:40.649
so that when a student applies to something like

737
00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:45.620
um um an emergency financial aid type thing, they

738
00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:47.639
don't have to wait a week or two weeks

739
00:47:47.649 --> 00:47:49.889
to receive the money they needed right then and

740
00:47:49.899 --> 00:47:53.810
there, right? So, so, so something a process that

741
00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.229
that could go faster would probably be a little,

742
00:47:57.239 --> 00:47:58.489
a little bit more ideal.

743
00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:02.179
Uh AND do you think uh and this will

744
00:48:02.189 --> 00:48:04.399
be my last question and uh do you think

745
00:48:04.409 --> 00:48:08.780
that uh the trends when it comes to some

746
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.919
of these barriers you mentioned to uh success uh

747
00:48:12.929 --> 00:48:17.699
in university and elsewhere? Uh THAT uh do you

748
00:48:17.709 --> 00:48:20.739
think that trends there are positive or not?

749
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.199
I think they're positive. And I at the same

750
00:48:25.209 --> 00:48:27.040
time, I think that there is a long way

751
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:31.129
to go too, right? Um A again, going back

752
00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:33.679
to the basic needs and security example, we we

753
00:48:33.689 --> 00:48:37.469
definitely seen lots of changes only over the past

754
00:48:37.479 --> 00:48:40.830
five years or so with various programs in place,

755
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.639
universities really being more aware of this, really being

756
00:48:44.649 --> 00:48:47.570
an issue, right? But before, like 10 years ago.

757
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.419
I don't know if, if we even knew that

758
00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:53.110
that's a problem. Probably not. Um, SO now we

759
00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.949
know that that's a problem and we work to

760
00:48:54.959 --> 00:48:58.409
address it and that's, that's great. So, the trends

761
00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:04.000
are positive. Um, AND at the same time, um,

762
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:07.840
you know, now that we tackled this big thing,

763
00:49:07.989 --> 00:49:11.600
um, maybe we kinda have to wonder, you know,

764
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.070
what are other things that might be out there

765
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.030
that prevent students from being successful um And see

766
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.199
how um how we can help address them?

767
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:25.919
Great. So, uh just before we go, would you

768
00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:28.560
like to tell people where they can find you

769
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.370
when you work on the internet?

770
00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:35.219
Thank you for asking that. Yeah, absolutely. So, um

771
00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:38.739
I have a website where I try to centralize

772
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.120

00:49:49.864 --> 00:49:53.534
happy to connect and talk to people. Um I,

776
00:49:53.544 --> 00:49:57.625
I love just, you know, having conversations, exchanging ideas

777
00:49:57.635 --> 00:50:01.735
and um and you know, see where that takes

778
00:50:01.764 --> 00:50:01.804
