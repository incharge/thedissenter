00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.819
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.829 --> 00:00:04.988
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.940
And today I'm joined by Doctor Daniel Simons. He

4
00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:10.140
is a professor in the Department of Psychology at the

5
00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:14.319
University of Illinois where he also directs the visual cognition

6
00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.208
laboratory. And today we're focusing on his latest book

7
00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.789
together with Dr Christopher Chabris, who I've already have

8
00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:24.089
on the show, by the way, nobody is

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.138
fo why we get taken in and what we can

10
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.978
do about it. So Dr Simons, welcome to

11
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.809
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:34.789
Thank you for having me on. So tell us

13
00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:37.880
perhaps first a little bit about the premise of the

14
00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:39.709
book. I mean, I even have a quote

15
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.848
here where you say that it's basically about exploring the

16
00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.069
cognitive psychology of the cheat, the patterns of thinking

17
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.520
and reasoning that make us all vulnerable to deception.

18
00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:55.279
Could you explain that? Yeah. And that's the

19
00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529
broad theme of the book. We took a look

20
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.340
over many years at scams and, and cons and

21
00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:03.558
just regular run of the mill deception across a wide

22
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.219
range of disciplines, everything from investment fraud to cheating

23
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.760
in chess to try and see whether there were any

24
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.109
commonalities across all of them. And what we started

25
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.750
to realize was that there were some common tendencies that

26
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.480
we all have that make it possible for people to

27
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:22.569
take advantage of us. And there are tendencies that

28
00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.329
work well most of the time. But that when

29
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:26.668
somebody is looking to take advantage of us, they

30
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.620
co opt them or hijack them for their own purposes

31
00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.028
. So that was one theme that we found that

32
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.168
was really consistent across a wide range of kinds of

33
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.579
deception. The other was that any of us can

34
00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:41.459
be fooled. We, we have this kind of

35
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.109
intuition that and belief that when you hear about a

36
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.409
fraud, you hear about somebody falling for a scam

37
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.028
. In retrospect, you can see all the red

38
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.028
flags they missed, you can see everything that they

39
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.319
didn't notice along the way. And that makes it

40
00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.680
seem like they must be clueless or naive or gullible

41
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.198
. But the reality is that the scammers just happen

42
00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.230
to target them well, for that particular scam and

43
00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.519
any of us, no matter how educated, smart

44
00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:10.808
, skeptical, critical thinking we are can be victimized

45
00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.469
if the targeting is aimed at us. Yeah.

46
00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.860
And we'll get into some of the aspects of human

47
00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:22.189
cognition that you explore in the book that make us

48
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.240
susceptible, all of us susceptible to deception. And

49
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.491
I guess that that's uh very good point because actually

50
00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:31.893
, I mean, almost every single time that we

51
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:36.893
hear about someone falling for what, for us from

52
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.542
the outside seems like a very basic scam. We're

53
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:43.062
always like, oh, it's because the person was

54
00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:46.542
really gullible or stupid or dumb. Or it's because

55
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.284
she's low in intelligence. But that doesn't seem to

56
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.444
be really the case, at least most of the

57
00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:53.966
time. Exactly. And, and there's, there's

58
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:58.906
so much entertainment industry depiction of cons and scams.

59
00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:00.974
Right. And you can go to the theater and

60
00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:01.365
see a heist movie, you can listen to a

61
00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:05.936
podcast and hear all about a con artist. But

62
00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:08.045
whenever you do that, you know that there's deception

63
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.385
taking place, you, you are watching it knowing

64
00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:14.094
that it's about deception, which means that you're looking

65
00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.754
for all of those hallmarks, you're treating it more

66
00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:16.545
like a mystery where you're trying to figure out where

67
00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:20.240
they went wrong. But when somebody is immersed in

68
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.508
the narrative themselves, when they're, when they're the

69
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.069
target of it, they don't see it from that

70
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.080
outside perspective, they only see what they're being provided

71
00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:30.199
and that can lead to anybody if it's targeted,

72
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.300
appropriately being fooled. But do you think that there

73
00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:36.949
is good evidence that we have sort of a truth

74
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.710
bias that is that we most of the time tend

75
00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.074
to believe or have this tendency to believe at face

76
00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:49.115
value on what people are, what other people are

77
00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:51.883
saying? And I mean, if so, is

78
00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:54.514
that really a problem? Because isn't it that at

79
00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:59.145
least most of the time, there's very good reasons

80
00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:01.944
to think that what someone is saying is actually true

81
00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:03.985
. Yeah. Absolutely. And most of the time

82
00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:08.125
nobody's trying to deceive us. So it makes sense

83
00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.493
for us to accept what we're hearing is true most

84
00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:13.679
of the time. That's what we call a truth

85
00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.479
bias. That the idea of a truth bias is

86
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.459
a little more nuanced than, than just accepting everything

87
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.269
is true. It's the idea that whenever we hear

88
00:04:20.278 --> 00:04:24.528
something, whenever somebody tells us something, our initial

89
00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:29.119
evaluation of what they've said assumes it's true regardless of

90
00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.309
what it is. And then it takes a little

91
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.730
bit of time or a little bit of effort to

92
00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.399
rip it apart if we think it's wrong. So

93
00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.629
, and you know, it's easier in some context

94
00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.699
than others. If somebody says something that we firmly

95
00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.988
don't believe or there's somebody that we don't ever trust

96
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.040
, we know not to trust them, we're going

97
00:04:46.048 --> 00:04:47.709
to discount what they say pretty quickly. But um

98
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.899
, we have to take in what they're saying,

99
00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.028
process it make sense of it. And part of

100
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.629
that is kind of like the need to accept that

101
00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.939
it's real that it's true before we then debunk it

102
00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:00.559
. So a truth bias is really a functional thing

103
00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.500
. We have to have that otherwise we couldn't interact

104
00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.389
with anybody around us, our society would not be

105
00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.230
able to function. We have to trust that most

106
00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:10.220
of the time what we're hearing is true. And

107
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.778
that's the base rate for that is good, right

108
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.009
? That, that's actually what we want to be

109
00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:17.509
doing. Um The trick comes in how people who

110
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.319
are trying to deceive us, take advantage of that

111
00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:21.519
. They'll give us some information that's not true,

112
00:05:21.528 --> 00:05:25.028
but then not give us the opportunity to tear it

113
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.619
apart or to critique it or to realize that it's

114
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.899
false? And are there specific conditions where people remain

115
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.079
uncertain or skeptical of what someone claims? I mean

116
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:42.649
, are there specific situations, cases conditions where uh

117
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.350
I mean, even though for most situations, if

118
00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:50.778
someone just says something that doesn't trigger in us,

119
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:58.803
I mean, our perhaps uh uh deception uh detecting

120
00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:01.194
or a device or something like that. Uh I

121
00:06:01.204 --> 00:06:04.314
mean, that, that we e even then think

122
00:06:04.324 --> 00:06:06.923
, OK, so in this particular case, I

123
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:12.483
will remain skeptical until I learn a little bit more

124
00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:14.625
. So I think we often do that we should

125
00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:16.483
do it a lot more remaining uncertain is probably the

126
00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:21.009
best thing we could do to avoid spreading unintentionally spreading

127
00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:25.899
misinformation or repeating falsehoods. I if you remain uncertain

128
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.319
a little bit longer and look for more information,

129
00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:32.238
that's a great strategy to make sure you're not being

130
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.678
fooled. Um And there, there certainly are going

131
00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.470
to be context when we are going to do that

132
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.389
, right? We're going to be more willing to

133
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.139
be skeptical when it's something that we had doubts about

134
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.009
to begin with when it kind of ran counter to

135
00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.608
our beliefs or our ideology or our, you know

136
00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.358
, willing. So if somebody, for example,

137
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:55.209
provides scientific evidence, claims to provide scientific evidence for

138
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.838
ESP um I don't believe that's likely to be true

139
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.569
. I think there's plenty of good reasons not to

140
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.738
believe that that's true. Um As a scientist,

141
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.949
I should remain uncertain as long as I can until

142
00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.290
the evidence becomes overwhelming. In that particular case,

143
00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:11.399
I think it's pretty overwhelming, but let's say that

144
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.619
somebody provides some evidence for something that I don't agree

145
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.548
with, I don't think is likely to be true

146
00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:17.189
, but it might be, well, that's a

147
00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.019
context in which I should remain uncertain a little bit

148
00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:23.608
longer. I should be willing to accept the possibility

149
00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:27.480
that I was wrong um initially or that the evidence

150
00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.988
that they're providing is wrong and that, that's a

151
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.899
great strategy to use. It's one that we should

152
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.949
use a lot more than we do. Uh including

153
00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.358
scientists, scientists don't remain uncertain as much as they

154
00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:40.139
should. They're much more willing to take on a

155
00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:43.730
strong belief and then discount anything that runs counter to

156
00:07:43.738 --> 00:07:46.838
it. But we should remain uncertain until the evidence

157
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.108
is clear. The problem is we rarely have the

158
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:50.949
time or energy or willingness to do all of the

159
00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:54.559
digging that we need to, to show that it's

160
00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.369
actually clear. Mhm And so let's get into the

161
00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.338
aspects of human cognition you explore in the book that

162
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.939
really makes uh make us all susceptible to some,

163
00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:09.079
at least some degree of deception. So you talk

164
00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:13.670
about four different things, focus prediction, commitment and

165
00:08:13.678 --> 00:08:16.559
deficiency in the book. So starting with focus,

166
00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:20.290
what is this really about? Yeah. So those

167
00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:22.540
four, those four elements are what we call habits

168
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:26.600
. So there are cognitive tendencies that apply most of

169
00:08:26.608 --> 00:08:28.129
the time in our daily lives, the things that

170
00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:31.230
we have to do that usually are really, really

171
00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:33.649
effective for us. So focus is the idea that

172
00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:37.918
we primarily direct our attention to what we have right

173
00:08:37.928 --> 00:08:39.788
in front of us. The information that we have

174
00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:43.139
most of the time, the information we have is

175
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:46.080
the information we need. So it makes sense to

176
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.928
focus on what we're doing, what we're looking at

177
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.750
what we're thinking about at that moment. Um The

178
00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:54.168
challenge of focus is that we often don't realize when

179
00:08:54.178 --> 00:08:58.558
we don't have information that we might actually need and

180
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.788
that's where we run into problems. Um So the

181
00:09:01.798 --> 00:09:03.320
idea of focus is that most of the time we

182
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.489
use the information at hand to do what we need

183
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.710
to do with it, to make sense of the

184
00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:09.389
world. And that's usually a great thing and we

185
00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.469
usually don't have to worry about all of the other

186
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:13.570
stuff that would just be distractions from the thing we

187
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.820
want to pay attention to. The problem comes when

188
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.969
the things that we're missing really should be influencing our

189
00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:24.359
judgments, our decisions or our reactions to the world

190
00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:28.840
and people who are looking to deceive us will deliberately

191
00:09:28.849 --> 00:09:31.908
focus your attention on one thing. So, if

192
00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:35.629
you've ever been to a magician's show, a magic

193
00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.178
show, the magician is going to direct your attention

194
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.690
, they're going to get you to focus on the

195
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.178
effect what they're wanting you to see and away from

196
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.979
the method, the hidden information that they're trying to

197
00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:48.859
, um, that they're trying to keep away from

198
00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:50.149
you and they're going to do lots of things to

199
00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:52.710
focus your attention. They're going to have a lot

200
00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:54.450
of witty banter and joking that gets you focused on

201
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.830
what they're saying and not what they're doing. But

202
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.119
again, the idea is we focus on a limited

203
00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:01.428
amount of information. We can't focus on everything.

204
00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:05.599
And the end result of that is sometimes the things

205
00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:07.609
that we're not focusing on are things we need to

206
00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:11.629
pay attention to. Uh you mentioned magicians there.

207
00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:15.320
But I guess that there's another instance where people really

208
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.619
try to make us focus on just the positive aspects

209
00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:22.700
of, of something and make us lose focus of

210
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.099
the perhaps more negative aspects of something. Like,

211
00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:30.658
for example, when uh a company is trying to

212
00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:33.119
sell uh uh uh its products, I, I

213
00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:37.019
mean, in advertisement and all of that advertisement is

214
00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:41.190
basically all about that, right? It's basically about

215
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.450
focus and just focusing on the positive aspects of products

216
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.178
. So how do they do that? Exactly.

217
00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:50.904
Well, I mean, that, that's, they're

218
00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:52.654
just taking advantage of the fact that we do that

219
00:10:52.663 --> 00:10:54.423
naturally. So, advertising, I don't tend to

220
00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:58.053
think of advertising in the same light as cons and

221
00:10:58.065 --> 00:11:01.125
deceptions. Um, there they have a goal,

222
00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:03.075
they want you to think about their product and not

223
00:11:03.085 --> 00:11:05.315
alternative products. They want you to be directed attention

224
00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:07.445
to the positive features of their product and not to

225
00:11:07.455 --> 00:11:11.134
the negative ones. Right. So, um,

226
00:11:11.614 --> 00:11:13.465
so what do they do? They just don't present

227
00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:16.625
the negative ones, they present only the positive ones

228
00:11:16.928 --> 00:11:18.599
and we tend to kind of think that those are

229
00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:20.469
representatives. So I think one of the best examples

230
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:26.288
of this is um demos. So uh showing a

231
00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:31.668
video of a car driving itself and we see that

232
00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:33.158
video and say, wow, OK, I could

233
00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:33.379
, I would love to be able to do that

234
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.979
and just read a book while the car is driving

235
00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:39.269
me to work. Um And we think about all

236
00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.219
of the possible ways that that same process could generalize

237
00:11:43.229 --> 00:11:46.200
. We assume that what we're seeing is representative of

238
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.668
what that car can do. Um And we don't

239
00:11:48.678 --> 00:11:50.849
think about all of the things that they haven't shown

240
00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:54.969
us things like how many times did they try and

241
00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:58.729
do that demo before it worked once? Um How

242
00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:00.229
many times did the car drive off the side of

243
00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:01.538
the road? How many times did it run a

244
00:12:01.548 --> 00:12:03.330
stop light or a stop sign? Um We don't

245
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.889
think about those sorts of things. Does it only

246
00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.058
work on straight roads? Does it only work in

247
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.389
perfect sunlight conditions or would it not work if it's

248
00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:13.109
raining? What if a pedestrian ran out into the

249
00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.658
road? We don't tend to think about those things

250
00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:18.149
in real time while watching this demo. Instead,

251
00:12:18.158 --> 00:12:20.519
we take it as representative, our focus on that

252
00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:24.308
demo take treats it as typical of what happens in

253
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.250
the world and the end result is we just don't

254
00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:30.298
think about the information we don't have. So advertisers

255
00:12:30.308 --> 00:12:31.750
aren't having to do a whole lot to get us

256
00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.090
to focus on their product. All they have to

257
00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:35.190
do is present the information they want us to have

258
00:12:35.668 --> 00:12:37.509
and they can kind of count on us not thinking

259
00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:41.119
about the information we don't have unless they say something

260
00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:43.090
really egregious, then we might take a step back

261
00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:45.340
and say, wait a second. Is that really

262
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:48.099
true? And think about it, in which case

263
00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:50.210
they've lost us, that's not what they want us

264
00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:52.219
to do. And I guess, I guess that

265
00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:56.139
apart from the product, something that they do often

266
00:12:56.149 --> 00:13:00.538
is that they present next to the product, high

267
00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:03.599
status or very famous people, right? And that's

268
00:13:03.609 --> 00:13:07.869
another thing that perhaps make us lose focus on some

269
00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:11.744
of the potential negative aspects of the products. Right

270
00:13:11.764 --> 00:13:13.033
. Sure. And that, that's actually tapping into

271
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.774
one of the hooks that I guess we'll talk about

272
00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:16.764
in a little bit of familiarity. As well.

273
00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.965
It's, it's tapping into the idea that for somebody

274
00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:22.024
who's a very famous person we kind of feel like

275
00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:24.614
we know them even though we really don't. And

276
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.715
that familiarity makes us trust things more. So.

277
00:13:28.904 --> 00:13:30.433
Yeah, they, they use a lot of the

278
00:13:30.445 --> 00:13:31.654
advertising uses a lot of these sorts of tactics.

279
00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:33.264
Um, they take advantage of a lot of our

280
00:13:33.274 --> 00:13:37.879
strategies for how we process information. Um, just

281
00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:41.080
like people looking to actually deceive us do. Mhm

282
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.359
. And do you think that there are perhaps some

283
00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:48.000
strategies, some things that we could do to counter

284
00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:52.710
this tendency that we have to narrowly focus on just

285
00:13:52.908 --> 00:13:56.298
one piece of information? Well, I mean,

286
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.219
it depends what you mean by, by counter them

287
00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:01.139
. Can we make it so that we can take

288
00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.509
in everything at once? No, I mean,

289
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.879
and, and people like to kind of think so

290
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:11.359
. So you might know my earlier studies with people

291
00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:13.599
passing basketballs and a person in a girl suit walking

292
00:14:13.609 --> 00:14:16.658
through a video. Um, and people don't,

293
00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.889
about half the time people who watch that don't see

294
00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:22.168
the gorilla. Um, and one of the most

295
00:14:22.178 --> 00:14:24.899
common questions I get is, well, you know

296
00:14:24.908 --> 00:14:26.009
, what can I do? So that I see

297
00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:28.168
the gorilla and my reaction to that is first,

298
00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:30.629
there's nothing you can do that would make it so

299
00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:33.500
that you can always see unexpected things. And second

300
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:35.139
, that would be a terrible thing for you.

301
00:14:35.719 --> 00:14:37.840
You do not want that because there are limits on

302
00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:39.798
how much we can pay attention to and those are

303
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.739
structural limits on how our minds work. We all

304
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.558
have that sort of limitation we can't take in everything

305
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.168
all at once. Instead, we have this remarkable

306
00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:50.678
ability to focus on what we care about and to

307
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.509
ignore distractions that's essential. Can you imagine trying to

308
00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.418
drive down the road and not be able to ignore

309
00:14:58.428 --> 00:15:01.558
everything that's going on on the buildings next to you

310
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.279
and on the sidewalks, that's irrelevant to what you're

311
00:15:03.288 --> 00:15:05.389
doing. You'd be perpetually distracted. You couldn't focus

312
00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:09.048
on what you needed to do and an inability to

313
00:15:09.058 --> 00:15:11.440
focus is harmful. That's a problem for a lot

314
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.538
of people. Um we all have the ability to

315
00:15:13.548 --> 00:15:16.259
focus to some extent, right? We, we

316
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:18.399
can do that, but you can't get to the

317
00:15:18.408 --> 00:15:20.139
point that you take in everything and notice everything because

318
00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:22.529
then you couldn't focus anymore. And given that we

319
00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:26.190
have limitations, we have a total amount of resources

320
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.538
that we're able to use. Anything you use up

321
00:15:28.548 --> 00:15:31.340
on stuff that you don't care about is stuff that

322
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:33.399
you're not using for what you do care about.

323
00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:37.038
Mhm. And I guess that the aspect you mentioned

324
00:15:37.048 --> 00:15:41.629
there about expectations leads us to the second habit.

325
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:45.950
You're exploring the book that has to do with prediction

326
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.899
. So what's that about? Yeah. So prediction

327
00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:52.940
is uh the idea that we tend to kind of

328
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.450
look for the things that we expect to be there

329
00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.019
and want to be there. Um You can think

330
00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:00.298
of this as a little bit like the idea of

331
00:16:00.308 --> 00:16:03.739
confirmation bias. We tend to look for information that's

332
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.149
consistent with our beliefs as opposed to inconsistent with our

333
00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:07.038
beliefs. But we, we frame this a little

334
00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:11.960
bit more broadly, which is that um when we

335
00:16:11.969 --> 00:16:15.899
are given information that fits what we predict, we

336
00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.729
tend not to question it as much as we do

337
00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:21.950
when given information we disagree with. So if you're

338
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.729
online and somebody posts something that is completely opposite to

339
00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:30.548
your ide ideology or your politics, you're probably going

340
00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:32.479
to be highly critical of it. And we're really

341
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:33.830
good at tearing apart things. We don't believe in

342
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.989
. We all have that sort of critical ability to

343
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.399
rip something into pieces. But if somebody happens to

344
00:16:38.408 --> 00:16:41.529
share something that you happen to agree with, you're

345
00:16:41.538 --> 00:16:44.658
not likely to dig into it as deeply as you

346
00:16:44.668 --> 00:16:48.129
would otherwise. And if you don't dig into it

347
00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:49.279
, you might not realize that it's based on weak

348
00:16:49.288 --> 00:16:55.168
evidence. So you can pass off something that's not

349
00:16:55.178 --> 00:16:57.279
true by making it consistent with what people want to

350
00:16:57.288 --> 00:17:00.940
believe. And a huge amount of the misinformation we

351
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.189
see online is targeting people with information that they believe

352
00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:06.699
it's not, it's not trying to fool me into

353
00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.098
thinking something that I don't believe in the first place

354
00:17:08.108 --> 00:17:11.588
. It's spreading it to people who are likely to

355
00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:12.809
believe it who then spread it along to other people

356
00:17:12.818 --> 00:17:15.630
and that makes it kind of gain this sort of

357
00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:19.068
mass spread. Um So the whole idea of that

358
00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:23.390
sort of viral transmission is not, not persuading people

359
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.920
who disagree with you because they're going to tear it

360
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.140
to pieces. It's reaching the people who would agree

361
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.699
and not think critically enough. So, the idea

362
00:17:30.709 --> 00:17:33.098
of the, the habit of prediction is that we

363
00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:37.689
, um we tend to not think as critically about

364
00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:40.868
. We tend to accept the truth of things that

365
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.400
we expect and that we predict more than things that

366
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:47.140
we don't. And perhaps linking here to one of

367
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.500
the first points we made in our conversation when we

368
00:17:49.509 --> 00:17:53.049
mentioned that being deceived as very little or nothing to

369
00:17:53.059 --> 00:17:57.239
do with people being more gullible or less intelligent.

370
00:17:57.439 --> 00:18:00.729
I mean, I can't it be, can't it

371
00:18:00.739 --> 00:18:06.209
happen that if someone is better at reasoning, they

372
00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:10.989
might even be more blinded by their own expectations?

373
00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:12.410
Yeah, there's some, there's some suggestions of that

374
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.489
in the literature that people reason really well, e

375
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.000
even for simple problems known as syllogisms, where you

376
00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:21.969
give people a logical sequence, where you, you

377
00:18:21.979 --> 00:18:23.549
give them two premises and then a conclusion. If

378
00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:27.209
that conclusion fits your beliefs, you tend not to

379
00:18:27.219 --> 00:18:30.049
question whether it's logically sound as much as you do

380
00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:33.410
if it, if you disagree with it. So

381
00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:37.989
if you have a conclusion that gun regulations save lives

382
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.420
, which is of course an issue in the United

383
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.779
states, um, not as much elsewhere in the

384
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:42.900
world, fortunately, uh for the rest of the

385
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.910
world. But, um, if you believe that

386
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.689
gun regulation will save lives, then a conclusion that

387
00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:52.358
fits that, even if it's not logical, even

388
00:18:52.368 --> 00:18:55.989
if the premises don't lead to that conclusion, you're

389
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.848
going to tend to accept it as true. Whereas

390
00:18:56.858 --> 00:19:00.130
if you think that gun regulations are bad, you'll

391
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.500
find the logical flaws and the same thing. If

392
00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.509
you flip it, if you think if you've reached

393
00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:10.098
the conclusion that gun regulations are going to hurt safety

394
00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:11.779
, then if you believe that you're not going to

395
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:15.449
be as critical as of premises that just that don't

396
00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:15.979
match it, right. They don't actually lead to

397
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.949
that conclusion. So, yeah, very smart.

398
00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:25.309
People can tear apart conclusions that don't follow if they

399
00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:27.509
disagree with them but are not as critical when it

400
00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:30.750
comes to things that they agree with and can this

401
00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:37.209
sort of expectation based reasoning have a negative impact specifically

402
00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:41.529
in science and the production of scientific knowledge? I

403
00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:47.328
think it's actually the biggest source of inadvertent scientific errors

404
00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:49.568
, just mistakes. Um One way to think about

405
00:19:49.578 --> 00:19:52.170
this is imagine you're doing a study and you have

406
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.400
a new experimental treatment and you want to test it

407
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.969
in a randomized clinical trial. So you have a

408
00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.699
treatment and you have a placebo and you expect the

409
00:20:00.709 --> 00:20:04.769
treatment to do better than the placebo and that's what

410
00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:07.598
you find in your results. So great. Publish

411
00:20:07.608 --> 00:20:11.229
it. What if you had found that the placebo

412
00:20:11.239 --> 00:20:12.259
did better than the treatment? What would you do

413
00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:15.390
as a scientist? You go look at your data

414
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:15.818
and see. Did I get something wrong? Did

415
00:20:15.828 --> 00:20:18.348
I mislabel the columns? Did I get them backwards

416
00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:21.838
? Um Were there some problematic data points in there

417
00:20:21.848 --> 00:20:22.699
, were there some participants who weren't, you know

418
00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:26.338
, assigned correctly? So you'd look for problems and

419
00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:29.049
you look for mistakes And the key is that you

420
00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:32.328
look for mistakes more when something is unexpected and not

421
00:20:32.338 --> 00:20:33.680
what you predicted, and you're probably less likely to

422
00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:37.180
do that when it's predicted. And one of the

423
00:20:37.189 --> 00:20:41.680
most famous examples of this sort of error um came

424
00:20:41.689 --> 00:20:45.529
from work by uh Reinhart and Rogoff, who economists

425
00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:48.039
at Harvard, who were interested in pushing the idea

426
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:52.539
of austerity for fiscal austerity. So they analyzed uh

427
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:56.880
historical data from a bunch of countries and their claim

428
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.559
from their evidence was that once the country's debt reached

429
00:21:00.568 --> 00:21:03.618
90% of its GDP that their economic growth tapered off

430
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.630
, it crashed. So that was an argument that

431
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.479
we shouldn't be spending our way out of economic problems

432
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:14.039
because increasing the debt is going to kill our economic

433
00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:17.608
growth. Um The problem was that it was at

434
00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:18.358
the conclusion, the data were actually based on an

435
00:21:18.368 --> 00:21:22.029
Excel spreadsheet error. They didn't fill down an equation

436
00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:23.309
all the way down to the bottom. They,

437
00:21:23.328 --> 00:21:26.559
they stopped after 15 countries didn't go to all 20

438
00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:29.680
countries and the result doesn't hold if you actually include

439
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:30.910
the rest of the countries. So it literally was

440
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.118
just an error. Um And it was an innocent

441
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.489
mistake. I don't think there was any intentionality.

442
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.930
There, there was no fudging of data, there

443
00:21:37.939 --> 00:21:38.608
was no, you know, there, there was

444
00:21:38.618 --> 00:21:41.719
no scamming going on there, but they firmly believed

445
00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:45.170
this idea of austerity and when the results happened to

446
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.910
perfectly match it, they ran with it. They

447
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.289
didn't bother to check it. I guarantee you that

448
00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:52.868
if that result had come out the opposite, if

449
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.368
they had filled down and made a mistake in their

450
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.368
Excel spreadsheet, that had led to the claim that

451
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.000
austerity was terrible and that you could continue spending as

452
00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:02.559
much as you want. And there's no problem,

453
00:22:02.568 --> 00:22:03.568
they would have really triple checked their data and found

454
00:22:03.578 --> 00:22:07.088
the mistake. So that creeps in all the time

455
00:22:07.098 --> 00:22:10.000
. I think in scientific era that people are much

456
00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:14.299
more likely to rigorously check things that don't match what

457
00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:17.150
they predicted than there are things that perfectly match what

458
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.368
they predicted and being realistic here. And since scientists

459
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.588
are also people and like other people, they have

460
00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:27.689
basically the same psychology. Uh Do you think that

461
00:22:27.699 --> 00:22:33.420
uh since we can't expect scientists to not have any

462
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.309
expectations at all that this would be a point in

463
00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:42.729
favor of something like viewpoint diversity in science? I

464
00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:45.430
I think the first thing we should assume is that

465
00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:48.219
scientists always have opinions because we're human. So we

466
00:22:48.229 --> 00:22:51.930
always have beliefs, we always have expectations. We

467
00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:56.949
can't view things completely neutrally. Um I think this

468
00:22:56.959 --> 00:23:00.959
is an argument for implementing policies that make it harder

469
00:23:00.969 --> 00:23:03.180
for us to fool ourselves because the real danger in

470
00:23:03.189 --> 00:23:07.299
science is fooling ourselves. Uh Most scientists are not

471
00:23:07.309 --> 00:23:10.348
trying to fool other people, but they can be

472
00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:11.750
fooled themselves and then they spread information that's wrong.

473
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.920
Um I think there are a lot of things we

474
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.170
can do to actually hedge that. So one is

475
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.640
to uh use different approaches to publishing. So one

476
00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.750
is to write your analysis scripts in advance of the

477
00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:26.930
study um before you have any data and test them

478
00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:29.828
out with pilot data that you know, has different

479
00:23:29.838 --> 00:23:32.640
characteristics. So that when you apply to the real

480
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.650
data, you know that the analysis isn't going to

481
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.219
have an Excel spreadsheet error in other is to not

482
00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:37.858
use Excel for your data analysis, but that's a

483
00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:41.559
different issue. Um The other thing that I do

484
00:23:41.568 --> 00:23:45.309
in my own lab now is that for every study

485
00:23:45.318 --> 00:23:49.039
we do, um Typically I am a graduate student

486
00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:52.400
each independently code the data analysis. So we,

487
00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.019
we write the analysis separately ourselves and make sure that

488
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:57.630
we get the same results. And if we don't

489
00:23:57.739 --> 00:24:00.299
, normally it's just something, you know, a

490
00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:02.959
tiny coding bug, but you want to catch those

491
00:24:02.969 --> 00:24:07.150
before you publish them and that catches these sorts of

492
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.049
mistakes. Because if we're both analyzing the data,

493
00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:11.469
it makes it less likely that we're both going to

494
00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:15.838
make exactly the same error in, in our analysis

495
00:24:15.848 --> 00:24:18.500
or exactly the same error in our coding and you

496
00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:19.910
can find the discrepancies and figure out what's wrong with

497
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.098
them. So I think those are good things to

498
00:24:22.108 --> 00:24:26.338
do um in terms of ideological diversity. Yeah,

499
00:24:26.348 --> 00:24:29.078
I mean, the real challenge is, of course

500
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.348
, people aren't going to believe the opposite side.

501
00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:34.189
There are plenty of examples of this in science,

502
00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:37.630
you know, in every field of science, um

503
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.459
there are sub fields in psychology, for example,

504
00:24:41.469 --> 00:24:44.509
where there are two sides and they don't believe what

505
00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:47.559
the other side has to say. And it doesn't

506
00:24:47.568 --> 00:24:48.189
really matter how strong the evidence is, they won't

507
00:24:48.199 --> 00:24:52.439
listen to the other side and that's not productive,

508
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.759
right? We don't advance. Um I don't think

509
00:24:53.769 --> 00:24:56.400
it's necessarily a terrible thing for science as a whole

510
00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.059
because people outside of that fight who don't have a

511
00:25:00.068 --> 00:25:02.559
stake in, it can look at the evidence from

512
00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:03.239
the outside and say, ok, well, here's

513
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.959
what they're arguing about and I find one side more

514
00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:10.318
plausible than the other. So people not immersed in

515
00:25:10.328 --> 00:25:12.118
that fight, they're going to be able to take

516
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.989
a step back and be more objective because they don't

517
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.598
have, they don't have a horse in the race

518
00:25:17.608 --> 00:25:18.608
, right? So for them, it's not,

519
00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:23.789
it's not as ideologically, you know, complicated um

520
00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:26.930
for the debate about, you know, I,

521
00:25:26.939 --> 00:25:29.719
I think the debate about ideological diversity, I think

522
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:33.858
it's not just political diversity, it, it's having

523
00:25:33.868 --> 00:25:37.400
a range of views so that you aren't all expecting

524
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.828
exactly the same outcome and that, that can be

525
00:25:40.838 --> 00:25:44.789
true for a really narrow, boring question. You

526
00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.618
know, is there memory for where you've searched items

527
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.789
, letters in a display before or after, after

528
00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:52.719
you've searched that location? Is there any reference to

529
00:25:52.729 --> 00:25:53.729
that you've been there before? That's, that's a

530
00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:57.328
debate within part of the field I'm in. There's

531
00:25:57.338 --> 00:26:00.789
nothing, you know, deep and meaningful to anybody

532
00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:03.880
outside of that debate, but people within it are

533
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.328
going to hold strong views. That's ok. So

534
00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:11.309
, I, I think there's inherently diversity in the

535
00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:14.358
sense of having different perspectives on the same phenomenon,

536
00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:18.259
um, in science that otherwise there's no interest in

537
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.910
doing a study that everybody knows will come out the

538
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.769
same way. And I have this discussion in my

539
00:26:22.779 --> 00:26:25.150
lab all the time that if a student says I

540
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.910
often have an undergrad student who will propose a project

541
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.789
. And it's like, you know, wouldn't it

542
00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:30.779
be interesting if this were true? It's like,

543
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:33.608
oh, that's, that's great. But often they'll

544
00:26:33.618 --> 00:26:38.358
propose a study that's, um, like, ok

545
00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:41.299
, and I'll ask them, is there any reason

546
00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:44.489
anybody would disagree with your prediction? And if there's

547
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.828
not, then maybe it's not as interesting to do

548
00:26:47.838 --> 00:26:49.368
it, it's more interesting to do those studies where

549
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.969
if it comes out one way it supports one view

550
00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:52.039
if it comes out a different way, it supports

551
00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:53.709
the other view. And both of those are interesting

552
00:26:55.068 --> 00:26:56.769
. That's, that's the optimal kind of study.

553
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.449
And the third habit you mentioned in the book is

554
00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:06.000
commitment. So couldn't tell us first what commitments are

555
00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:11.489
and perhaps the differences between assumptions and commitments because that's

556
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.789
also something you explore in the book. Yeah.

557
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:18.699
So a commitment is an assumption that's held so firmly

558
00:27:18.709 --> 00:27:21.509
that we no longer are willing to question it and

559
00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:22.150
we don't think about it at all anymore. It

560
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.068
just becomes ingrained in how we act. So we

561
00:27:26.078 --> 00:27:27.689
all make assumptions all the time. We have to

562
00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:30.719
, you have to, we don't always have all

563
00:27:30.729 --> 00:27:33.160
the information. We have to assume a lot of

564
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.199
things about the world and about how other people are

565
00:27:34.209 --> 00:27:37.750
acting with us. And so assumptions are, are

566
00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:40.828
normal. What we expect commitments are when they can

567
00:27:40.838 --> 00:27:47.578
sometimes become uh maladaptive. So, so often we

568
00:27:47.588 --> 00:27:48.439
want to have strong commitments to some things, right

569
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:51.250
? We, we, we that's not necessarily a

570
00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:55.598
bad thing. Most of the time the problem comes

571
00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:59.289
when you are so firmly committed to something and it

572
00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:02.368
happens to be wrong that you don't question it.

573
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.578
So I think my favorite example of this from,

574
00:28:04.588 --> 00:28:10.608
from the book uh was um a discussion of a

575
00:28:10.618 --> 00:28:12.670
person who was a victim of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme

576
00:28:12.848 --> 00:28:17.318
. So the investment Ponzi scheme fraud biggest Ponzi scheme

577
00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.750
in the modern era. Um And there were a

578
00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:22.769
number of people who were questioning what was going on

579
00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:25.900
with Madoff's scheme. They were suspicious that there was

580
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.549
something fraudulent going on. And one of them told

581
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.289
one of his customers that had a customer whose parents

582
00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:36.739
were heavily invested in NADO. And he's told this

583
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.529
customer it's like, you know, you should tell

584
00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:41.189
your father this isn't good. He should be getting

585
00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:42.608
out of this. Um, he shouldn't be trusting

586
00:28:42.618 --> 00:28:45.699
this and the father's response was, well, he

587
00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:48.890
just doesn't know Bernie. I know Bernie and Bernie

588
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.338
would never screw us. That's a commitment. It's

589
00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:55.029
so firmly beheld that there's no way that Bernie Madoff

590
00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:59.130
could possibly be somebody who would treat us badly.

591
00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.489
And when you're committed to that belief, anything goes

592
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.390
, you, you're not willing to take a step

593
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.910
back and say, could this be a fraud because

594
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.509
he'd never screw us? It's a, it's a

595
00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:14.029
firm commitment and we see commitments going leading people astray

596
00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:15.559
in a lot of sort of conspiracy thinking. And

597
00:29:15.568 --> 00:29:19.459
in politics where people are so firmly holding the belief

598
00:29:19.469 --> 00:29:22.588
that this person, this politician, this person I

599
00:29:22.598 --> 00:29:25.759
like is infallible. They can do no wrong.

600
00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:29.199
They only tell the truth that you have to go

601
00:29:29.209 --> 00:29:30.348
to incredible lengths to kind of make all of their

602
00:29:30.358 --> 00:29:34.500
inconsistent statements hold together because you've got that commitment that

603
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:37.608
you can't back away from and it can lead you

604
00:29:37.618 --> 00:29:41.140
down this conspiratorial rabbit hole where you try and find

605
00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.719
all of these things to make everything work. It's

606
00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:45.049
like trying to find ways to make it so that

607
00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:45.989
all of the planets in the sun are orbiting the

608
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.118
earth. Right? If you start with that assumption

609
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.729
, you can find all sorts of weird convoluted ways

610
00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:52.390
to make it seem like it kind of works given

611
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.769
the evidence at hand, even though it's wrong and

612
00:29:56.779 --> 00:29:59.410
for anybody on the outside who doesn't have that commitment

613
00:29:59.588 --> 00:30:02.180
, it seems crazy, But from the inside,

614
00:30:02.189 --> 00:30:03.868
it's logically coherent and that, that's where you run

615
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.489
into these problems where people can't talk to each other

616
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.449
because one has a commitment that's so firm that they've

617
00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:15.689
gone down an entire path of logic, very reasonable

618
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.729
, entire path of logic starting from that commitment that

619
00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:22.858
they never questioned. But psychologically speaking, when it

620
00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:26.299
comes to this move from a simple assumption to a

621
00:30:26.309 --> 00:30:32.098
commitment, what is it based on exactly? Is

622
00:30:32.108 --> 00:30:37.380
it trust, confidence or some other thing? You

623
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.098
know, that's a great question and I don't have

624
00:30:38.108 --> 00:30:40.890
a great answer for it. It's, uh the

625
00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:42.390
, the, I think the key challenge for making

626
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.539
sure that you're not being deceived is thinking about what

627
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:48.959
are the assumptions that you won't question. And sometimes

628
00:30:48.969 --> 00:30:52.279
those, you know, those are reasonable assumptions.

629
00:30:52.469 --> 00:30:55.799
Um, you know, I have an assumption that

630
00:30:56.219 --> 00:31:00.160
people can't predict random events better than chance. And

631
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.910
I think there's a lot of evidence to back that

632
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.568
assumption, but it's an assumption. Um, if

633
00:31:04.578 --> 00:31:07.180
I became firmly committed to it, even if somebody

634
00:31:07.189 --> 00:31:11.420
were to come along and prevent present unquestionable evidence at

635
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.959
some level, I wouldn't accept it. And that's

636
00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:17.009
for a scientist that becomes a problem when you're so

637
00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:19.640
committed that you won't look at evidence that challenges your

638
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.219
perspective. That's when it's moved into commitments rather than

639
00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:26.509
assumptions. And, um, but what, what

640
00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:30.529
leads people to go that route? That's, it's

641
00:31:30.539 --> 00:31:32.709
a great question. I wish I had a strong

642
00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:34.989
answer for it. That's fair enough. So let's

643
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.670
get into the final habit before we talk about the

644
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.170
four hooks you want to explore in the book.

645
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.930
So, efficiency, what, what does that mean

646
00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:48.250
in this context? Exactly. Well, efficiency is

647
00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:51.709
just a tendency. We have to try and get

648
00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:55.209
things done in the fastest way and simplest way we

649
00:31:55.219 --> 00:31:57.130
can with the least effort, which the vast majority

650
00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.199
of the time is exactly what we want to do

651
00:32:00.309 --> 00:32:00.949
. You don't want to take the long way to

652
00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:04.189
work, you want to get there quickly. So

653
00:32:04.469 --> 00:32:07.348
, um efficiency is, is usually a great thing

654
00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:12.739
and it just means that we sometimes don't ask questions

655
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.739
when we should. Um So when people are looking

656
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.549
to deceive us, they take advantage of the fact

657
00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:21.390
that we aren't likely to ask more questions. We're

658
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.818
not likely to dig deeper and we take glib empty

659
00:32:23.828 --> 00:32:27.608
answers as good enough so that we can move on

660
00:32:27.858 --> 00:32:30.709
. And one way to think about this is it

661
00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:32.890
can be really uncomfortable and awkward to ask for more

662
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.640
information. So imagine you're at a psychic performance and

663
00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.209
you stand up and say, well, you know

664
00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:40.439
, do you, do you actually know that this

665
00:32:40.449 --> 00:32:45.719
person had bone cancer? Um You know, or

666
00:32:46.088 --> 00:32:47.769
, well, you started with Rob and then you

667
00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:52.328
said Bobby, uh why did you start with Bobby

668
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:57.239
? Those sorts of questions are awkward to ask and

669
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.890
imagine you're getting a, a business pitch. Um

670
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.789
Somebody's pitching your, you and they want to um

671
00:33:02.848 --> 00:33:05.318
they want to be a consultant for you and they

672
00:33:05.328 --> 00:33:07.358
cite all of their, you know, success stories

673
00:33:07.368 --> 00:33:09.578
like, well, that's great. Um It's really

674
00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:13.118
uncomfortable to ask, what are all your failure stories

675
00:33:13.828 --> 00:33:15.709
? How many other companies have you, have you

676
00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:19.219
uh consulted for that? Didn't get these results?

677
00:33:19.618 --> 00:33:22.559
Um You know, asking those sorts of questions is

678
00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:24.680
exactly what we need to get more information. It's

679
00:33:24.689 --> 00:33:28.338
, it's, you know, it's recognizing when somebody

680
00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:30.939
is getting us to focus on the information they're presenting

681
00:33:30.229 --> 00:33:32.269
. And in that for the sake of efficiency,

682
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:36.420
we often don't question even when we probably should.

683
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.318
We take empty answers as, as good enough like

684
00:33:39.328 --> 00:33:42.630
, oh, well, it's been validated. What

685
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.380
does that mean? We're using best practices whenever somebody

686
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.989
says that it often means that they can't define what

687
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.358
a best practice is. Um My favorite of these

688
00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:53.299
is somebody saying, well, we're being transparent whenever

689
00:33:53.309 --> 00:33:58.650
somebody says that they're not being transparent because being transparent

690
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.709
means showing not say not telling, right? Showing

691
00:34:00.719 --> 00:34:02.900
what you've done. So if you're being transparent,

692
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.130
like, well, how are you being transparent?

693
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.269
What, what have you shown us? Um I've

694
00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:09.570
run into that all the time. Like university administrators

695
00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:13.030
bragging about how transparent they're being when they haven't actually

696
00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:16.119
given any information. Yeah. Uh but don't you

697
00:34:16.128 --> 00:34:19.659
think, and if you disagree, please tell me

698
00:34:19.668 --> 00:34:22.719
, but don't you think that there are perhaps situations

699
00:34:22.728 --> 00:34:27.510
cases where when it comes to asking more questions,

700
00:34:27.769 --> 00:34:31.708
uh perhaps uh we are simply not sure about what

701
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:36.250
are, what are the correct questions to ask because

702
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.590
we are not familiar with that particular kind of subject

703
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.369
or where someone might be trying to sell us,

704
00:34:44.378 --> 00:34:46.793
for example. And in that case, I mean

705
00:34:46.804 --> 00:34:52.583
, it's also a lack of information. Uh And

706
00:34:52.594 --> 00:34:54.204
the fact that because we lack that information, we

707
00:34:54.215 --> 00:34:59.434
don't really know what questions we should ask. I

708
00:34:59.445 --> 00:35:01.583
think that's exactly right. That much of the time

709
00:35:01.594 --> 00:35:04.333
, we don't know what, what information we still

710
00:35:04.344 --> 00:35:06.934
need, we don't know what to ask. And

711
00:35:07.244 --> 00:35:08.164
of course, people are going to take advantage of

712
00:35:08.175 --> 00:35:12.804
that because people are going to be not confident about

713
00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:14.773
asking a question if they don't have some idea of

714
00:35:14.784 --> 00:35:15.664
what they want to get out of it. Um

715
00:35:15.918 --> 00:35:20.378
So that's how, that's how people will bluster past

716
00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:22.728
you and take advantage of your efficiency. It's efficient

717
00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:27.289
not to ask questions. Um It's also efficient to

718
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.228
avoid kind of making yourself uncomfortable, right? Because

719
00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:32.619
that's just gonna take more effort and energy. Um

720
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.889
But I think there are a lot of things you

721
00:35:34.898 --> 00:35:37.530
can do just to, to start asking questions that

722
00:35:37.539 --> 00:35:40.019
sometimes will reveal more even if you don't quite know

723
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.820
what you want. So, one good thing is

724
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:45.619
what else can you tell me or say more?

725
00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:50.010
And it's not a question but it gets, gets

726
00:35:50.019 --> 00:35:52.110
whoever you're talking to, to, to talk more

727
00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:53.500
and you know, that, that's like that standard

728
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.760
sort of trope of detective movies where, you know

729
00:35:57.769 --> 00:36:00.208
, you've got the, got the person who you

730
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:00.659
think is the criminal there and you just want them

731
00:36:00.668 --> 00:36:02.659
to talk more so they give them, give away

732
00:36:02.668 --> 00:36:07.898
information, same principle in cases that aren't that adversarial

733
00:36:07.909 --> 00:36:08.010
just say, OK, can you, can you

734
00:36:08.019 --> 00:36:09.978
tell me a little more or say more about that

735
00:36:10.438 --> 00:36:14.228
? Um And if you do that people will talk

736
00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:15.110
more and if they talk more, that might raise

737
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.070
more specific questions you could ask. So that's,

738
00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:21.199
that's a good tactic to just start out. Um

739
00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:22.708
Another, another question you can ask, that's a

740
00:36:22.719 --> 00:36:28.648
little more directed that uh that we'll get more information

741
00:36:28.659 --> 00:36:30.639
is what could you tell me that might make me

742
00:36:30.648 --> 00:36:35.409
disagree with you, which is, um, a

743
00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:37.360
way of kind of, you know, eliciting this

744
00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:40.849
information that, you know, we really need.

745
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.898
Um, that, that's the sort of question that

746
00:36:43.909 --> 00:36:45.639
I recommend that journalists ask when they talk to scientists

747
00:36:45.648 --> 00:36:47.429
, like who might disagree with this position. And

748
00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:52.719
why would they disagree with you? And any scientists

749
00:36:52.728 --> 00:36:52.869
should be able to answer that and say, ok

750
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:54.539
, well, here's why somebody might disagree with my

751
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.090
position. Here's why I think they're wrong, but

752
00:36:57.099 --> 00:37:00.059
here's why they might disagree. And that gives you

753
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.530
an end to what are the commitments that they have

754
00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:05.728
? What are their assumptions, um, who might

755
00:37:05.739 --> 00:37:07.789
have different sets of assumptions and who could you ask

756
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.090
about them? So, the whole idea is to

757
00:37:09.099 --> 00:37:13.329
get people to give you information that they wouldn't spontaneously

758
00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.309
give you if they were trying to take advantage of

759
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.978
your willingness not to ask questions and you're willing just

760
00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:22.188
to kind of get through things efficiently. Uh Also

761
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:23.969
because in this particular case, I would imagine that

762
00:37:23.978 --> 00:37:29.070
if you're not familiar with the whatever the other person

763
00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:30.208
is talking about or trying to sell you, for

764
00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:35.929
example, that's also a way of getting more information

765
00:37:35.938 --> 00:37:37.760
. And I mean, if at the end of

766
00:37:37.769 --> 00:37:42.688
the conversation, you still do not fully understand what

767
00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:45.050
they're trying to sell you, then perhaps it's just

768
00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:47.590
better to not buy. Yeah. And I think

769
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:50.610
that's often the often the case, right? That

770
00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:52.829
more often than not the reason for asking questions is

771
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.250
to get more information. Well, one way to

772
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.378
get more information is to ask really focused questions.

773
00:37:58.389 --> 00:38:00.289
If you happen to know enough to ask those,

774
00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.030
the other is just to get the person to talk

775
00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:06.099
more because when somebody is trying to advertise to you

776
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.378
. They want to show you just the information they

777
00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:09.239
have in front of them that they want to provide

778
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:13.139
you. If they have to talk more, if

779
00:38:13.148 --> 00:38:14.909
they just start repeating themselves, then you know that

780
00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.659
they actually don't have anything to say. But if

781
00:38:16.668 --> 00:38:19.728
they can provide more information that you might have a

782
00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:21.619
better understanding. So, yeah, absolutely. That's

783
00:38:21.628 --> 00:38:23.090
, that's the whole idea is take a moment,

784
00:38:23.099 --> 00:38:25.938
even if it's just asking one or two more questions

785
00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:29.500
, when you're making an important decision can get you

786
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.929
a lot more information and often one question will lead

787
00:38:31.938 --> 00:38:37.099
to others. Mhm And related still to efficiency.

788
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.168
There's this concept of opportunity costs. I mean,

789
00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:44.750
what are opportunity costs and why is it that sellers

790
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.780
usually do not want you to consider them? Yeah

791
00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:51.679
. So I mean, opportunity costs. The simple

792
00:38:51.688 --> 00:38:52.929
way to think about an opportunity cost is what else

793
00:38:52.938 --> 00:38:55.570
could you do with your time or money? Um

794
00:38:55.938 --> 00:39:00.860
And would you prefer that? So um somebody is

795
00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:01.829
trying to sell you something means that they want to

796
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.590
take your money for their product, which means you

797
00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:07.188
don't have that money available for anything else for any

798
00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:10.469
to invest or to buy something different. Um So

799
00:39:10.478 --> 00:39:14.019
they want to focus you on the benefits of their

800
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.188
product and they don't want you to think about what

801
00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:16.610
else you could use that money for because then you

802
00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:20.789
might not buy the product. So um a lot

803
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.389
of the goal of advertising, of course, is

804
00:39:22.398 --> 00:39:25.458
to get you to buy things without thinking about opportunities

805
00:39:25.469 --> 00:39:27.829
that you might have if you use the money for

806
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.188
something else. Um, I, I think,

807
00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:34.869
uh, yeah, I mean, I think that's

808
00:39:34.878 --> 00:39:37.789
the basic idea of, of opportunity costs. Um

809
00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:40.938
, one thing to think about for opportunity costs is

810
00:39:40.949 --> 00:39:44.708
that, you know, thinking about all of those

811
00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:47.849
opportunity costs is inefficient. So if you have to

812
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.760
think about all of the other things that you might

813
00:39:50.769 --> 00:39:52.369
do instead that slows you down, it means that

814
00:39:52.378 --> 00:39:54.449
you're not making quick decisions, you're having to,

815
00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:57.739
you, you're trying to decide which of several strategies

816
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.958
you want to use for your business. That means

817
00:39:59.989 --> 00:40:01.070
, you know, thinking about what would happen if

818
00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:04.639
you didn't do any of those. Um it takes

819
00:40:04.648 --> 00:40:08.289
extra time, it takes extra effort. So anticipating

820
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.030
opportunity costs and thinking about them is inefficient in the

821
00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:14.320
sense that we don't just plow ahead and get done

822
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.809
and we have a strong drive to do that.

823
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:20.789
So countering that when it matters is the key.

824
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.378
You don't, you don't want to think about opportunity

825
00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:23.559
costs. Every time you go to the grocery store

826
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.300
and decide to buy a box of cereal, you

827
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:28.289
don't want to stop and think what else could I

828
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.989
use this money for other than cereal? You know

829
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.659
, if I, if I need breakfast food,

830
00:40:31.668 --> 00:40:34.119
I could think about other breakfast food. But what

831
00:40:34.128 --> 00:40:36.289
if I invested that money now? And you know

832
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.938
how much value would it have to me later if

833
00:40:37.949 --> 00:40:38.739
I skipped breakfast, you don't want to go through

834
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.969
that sort of thought process every time you do anything

835
00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:44.728
you want to think about when it matters and when

836
00:40:44.739 --> 00:40:50.728
it doesn't. And so we've gone through the four

837
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:53.909
main psychological habits, I guess that make us vulnerable

838
00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:59.148
to deception getting now into the hooks that people use

839
00:40:59.159 --> 00:41:00.289
to deceive us. So in the book, you

840
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:05.989
go through consistency, precision, potency and familiarity starting

841
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.590
with consistency, what do you that is really about

842
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.019
in this context? But let me step back and

843
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.300
say what hooks hooks are. So um we think

844
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:20.590
of hooks as information in a form that we find

845
00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:22.329
really attractive. So people who are looking to deceive

846
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.668
us are going to present information in a way that

847
00:41:24.918 --> 00:41:28.780
appeals to us that we find more likely to be

848
00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:31.478
true um that we don't think as much about.

849
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.219
So again, it's one of those tactics people use

850
00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:37.619
to get us to stick with our initial assessment that

851
00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:38.898
something is true and not to question it as much

852
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:43.458
. And all of these hooks lead us to sort

853
00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:45.250
of jump right in without thinking. So the metaphor

854
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.349
I like to use for this is um a bull

855
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.260
fight, a matador. And so the matador stand

856
00:41:52.269 --> 00:41:53.329
there perfectly still with their red cape and they're going

857
00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.728
to wave that cape around and the bull finds that

858
00:41:57.929 --> 00:42:01.309
irresistible and charges um charges right in without realizing that

859
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.530
, you know, there's a blade behind it.

860
00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:07.860
Um So that, that sort of running in without

861
00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:10.438
thinking about it, um is what happens when we

862
00:42:10.449 --> 00:42:14.039
get information that we find particularly appealing and it's not

863
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.000
always just blindly running in, it's just accepting something

864
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:21.478
is true when we maybe shouldn't. So, um

865
00:42:21.489 --> 00:42:22.889
the first of those that you mentioned is consistency,

866
00:42:22.898 --> 00:42:25.050
which is, and, and again, just like

867
00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:28.478
for the habits, the vast majority of time,

868
00:42:28.898 --> 00:42:30.449
these kinds of information are really good, they're really

869
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:34.219
useful. Consistency is a perfect example of that.

870
00:42:34.228 --> 00:42:37.918
Usually, if something is consistently the case, that

871
00:42:37.929 --> 00:42:39.000
means it's reliable, that means it's predictable, that

872
00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:43.449
means we can count on it. Um And those

873
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.949
are typically great things for most of what we do

874
00:42:45.958 --> 00:42:49.728
in the world, having something to be consistent is

875
00:42:50.398 --> 00:42:51.989
terrific. That's, that's what we want it to

876
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.739
be. Um The problem comes in that we don't

877
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:00.458
always recognize first when we shouldn't expect consistency. Um

878
00:43:00.469 --> 00:43:01.579
And don't look for when it should be varying.

879
00:43:02.289 --> 00:43:06.110
But second, when somebody is looking to deceive us

880
00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:07.550
, they use these hooks, they'll present these hooks

881
00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:12.628
without having the underlying truth behind it. So somebody

882
00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:16.989
will present information that seems really consistent because it's fabricated

883
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.329
, not because it's actually genuine and, and reliable

884
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.668
and robust. So uh in fabricated data, um

885
00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:27.719
this is something that happens in science, you know

886
00:43:27.728 --> 00:43:30.590
, unfortunately, more often than we like, um

887
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:35.079
people will, people who have committed scientific fraud often

888
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.349
will present results that are consistently great. They get

889
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.070
the same result every single time and just as strong

890
00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:45.119
an effect, every single time when in reality,

891
00:43:45.128 --> 00:43:47.559
that's not how randomness works. And it's not how

892
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:51.449
human behavior typically works. You don't always get the

893
00:43:51.458 --> 00:43:53.449
same thing every single time, especially in sort of

894
00:43:53.458 --> 00:43:57.030
a field where there's a lot of randomness inherent in

895
00:43:57.039 --> 00:43:59.550
it. Um even in physics where you're measuring something

896
00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:01.090
really, really precisely. Um And you want to

897
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:04.708
get the same results every time there's still randomness in

898
00:44:04.719 --> 00:44:07.119
the measurement and it's not going to be exactly the

899
00:44:07.128 --> 00:44:09.050
same to an infinite level of precision every single time

900
00:44:09.128 --> 00:44:12.360
you expect that noise. So if somebody gave you

901
00:44:12.398 --> 00:44:15.199
exactly the same thing to 20 decimal places, every

902
00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:16.938
single time, you'd worry about it. You should

903
00:44:16.949 --> 00:44:19.739
be worried about it because that doesn't account for how

904
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.188
random things are. Um So somebody who's committing fraud

905
00:44:22.199 --> 00:44:25.269
will present that consistency because we like consistency. It

906
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.019
appeals. If somebody can get the same results every

907
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.079
time, it's like, wow, that must be

908
00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.929
true. And the reality is that yes, if

909
00:44:32.938 --> 00:44:36.228
they genuinely got the same result every time, that'd

910
00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:37.619
be great. And we use that as a great

911
00:44:37.628 --> 00:44:39.849
rule of thumb most of the time. But when

912
00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.449
somebody is committing fraud, they just don't have to

913
00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:43.929
do the data, don't have to do the actual

914
00:44:43.938 --> 00:44:45.429
studies. They can just make up consistent data.

915
00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:47.349
And that appeals to us and we don't think critically

916
00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.978
enough about it. So it's basically that idea if

917
00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.539
it's too perfect or too good to be true.

918
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.750
So, I mean, if it, if it

919
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.659
sounds like that then prep probably it's not true.

920
00:45:01.128 --> 00:45:02.458
Well, and that, that's the challenge, right

921
00:45:02.469 --> 00:45:05.128
? Because what sounds too good to be true to

922
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.090
one person sounds just good enough to another. Um

923
00:45:07.099 --> 00:45:12.269
And so it becomes really difficult to use that rule

924
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.360
of thumb consistently because you know, something AAA con

925
00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:20.340
artist or a scammer who is targeting you is going

926
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:22.239
to make it sound just good enough. Whereas the

927
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:24.478
person next door to you who hears that same pitch

928
00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:27.179
might say that's ridiculous. That's way too good to

929
00:45:27.188 --> 00:45:28.958
be true, right? So it, it has

930
00:45:28.969 --> 00:45:30.780
to be targeted appropriately. And I think targeting is

931
00:45:30.789 --> 00:45:32.550
what counts for whether you think it's too good or

932
00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:37.688
just good enough, but they're going to present information

933
00:45:37.699 --> 00:45:40.628
that is good enough that you will accept it as

934
00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:43.989
true and they use all of these hooks. But

935
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.309
consistency is I think in science, one of the

936
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:49.599
most common ones um to give you data that just

937
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.539
seems great. So I think one of the famous

938
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.260
examples of this is Jan Hendrik Schon who's a,

939
00:45:55.269 --> 00:46:00.628
was a German uh uh in America in Bell Labs

940
00:46:00.639 --> 00:46:04.929
, but he, he um studied uh superconductivity back

941
00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:07.389
in the early two thousands and was a physics superstar

942
00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:12.659
young guy at what was then uh Bell labs and

943
00:46:13.019 --> 00:46:15.289
he published, I think 16 papers in the journals

944
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.119
, Nature and Science, the top two science wide

945
00:46:19.128 --> 00:46:22.610
journals, 16 papers in two years himself. And

946
00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.878
that's, that's like the output of an entire top

947
00:46:24.909 --> 00:46:28.199
notch physics department in in two years, it might

948
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:31.780
be higher than that. So superstar um publishing evidence

949
00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:37.039
of superconductivity with different materials. And um it turns

950
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.199
out that uh if you line up all the papers

951
00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:42.789
next to each other, he was reusing the same

952
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.918
data uh and just changing the axes and changing the

953
00:46:45.929 --> 00:46:47.458
materials and changing the voltages in, in the figures

954
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.898
. But the figures were the same um they were

955
00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:53.840
likely just manufactured. It's not clear that there was

956
00:46:53.849 --> 00:46:57.780
ever any result. But that cost, you know

957
00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.559
, hundreds of labs, more than 100 labs had

958
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.079
spent years trying to replicate his works and millions and

959
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.769
millions of dollars trying to replicate his work. Um

960
00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.289
So it had consequence, but the, the hallmark

961
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.369
of the the misconduct there was that the images were

962
00:47:12.378 --> 00:47:14.199
the same, the data were too consistent to be

963
00:47:14.208 --> 00:47:19.320
possible. Um And the thing I find most interesting

964
00:47:19.329 --> 00:47:22.688
about this sort of scientific misconduct and scientific fraud is

965
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.099
it's out there in the open. It's literally in

966
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.719
the publications, you can see that it's too consistent

967
00:47:28.728 --> 00:47:30.469
to be true, but it gets past peer reviewers

968
00:47:30.478 --> 00:47:34.449
and editors and other scientists for a variety of reasons

969
00:47:34.458 --> 00:47:36.639
. It seems really good, it seems consistent,

970
00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:38.110
you know, and people don't ask one more question

971
00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:39.878
, they process it efficiently, they read it quickly

972
00:47:39.889 --> 00:47:40.909
and say, oh, yeah, he found this

973
00:47:40.918 --> 00:47:45.809
again and that sounds like a positive when in reality

974
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.360
it should be a red flag. Mhm. Yeah

975
00:47:47.369 --> 00:47:50.809
. And that's the thing, right. Even earlier

976
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.840
when we talked about the scientists, that's another sort

977
00:47:53.849 --> 00:47:57.699
of evidence that we can look into, uh,

978
00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:00.610
and make the case that scientists really are like,

979
00:48:00.898 --> 00:48:05.000
uh other people because in, uh, if it

980
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.349
goes past uh peer review and all of that,

981
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.199
I mean, it's not at least not usually the

982
00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:15.418
case that people who are reviewing the studies are really

983
00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:19.519
incompetent. It's just that they are most of the

984
00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.958
time relying on these psychological habits. Yeah, I

985
00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:27.929
mean, and, and we can't dig into the

986
00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:30.530
details of every aspect of every paper and compare them

987
00:48:30.539 --> 00:48:34.418
to every other paper that somebody has written in real

988
00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:36.829
time. While we're also doing our own work,

989
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.699
people have to be efficient. Um But I think

990
00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:42.168
this is a great example because it does illustrate that

991
00:48:42.179 --> 00:48:45.349
we all can be fooled by, by people trying

992
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.860
to deceive us, especially if those people who are

993
00:48:46.869 --> 00:48:50.010
trying to deceive us are at all sophisticated about it

994
00:48:50.019 --> 00:48:51.860
. But the people who are being fooled in the

995
00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:57.648
sciences are generally pretty smart, um definitely highly trained

996
00:48:57.659 --> 00:49:00.708
, they're trained to be critical thinkers, they're trained

997
00:49:00.719 --> 00:49:02.458
to evaluate evidence and they still can be fooled.

998
00:49:02.469 --> 00:49:05.769
We all can be if it's targeting it, right

999
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.898
. And if you look at a lot of the

1000
00:49:06.909 --> 00:49:09.168
scientific fraud that's out there more often than not.

1001
00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:14.289
It's not earth shattering or groundbreaking work more often than

1002
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.469
not. It is kind of what we would predict

1003
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:19.898
in, in a field or at least kind of

1004
00:49:19.909 --> 00:49:21.599
what a lot of people in that field would predict

1005
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.648
and expect. Um It's often a little bit more

1006
00:49:23.659 --> 00:49:28.550
impressive in some way. So it's methodologically heroic.

1007
00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:30.090
It took a huge amount of effort to do or

1008
00:49:30.219 --> 00:49:35.010
it used a group of uh participants or subjects or

1009
00:49:35.019 --> 00:49:37.378
, you know, a population or animals that are

1010
00:49:37.389 --> 00:49:39.699
hard to access. Um So that makes it more

1011
00:49:39.708 --> 00:49:43.728
impressive, right? It, it usually is slightly

1012
00:49:43.739 --> 00:49:46.039
cleaner, uh slightly better than what other people have

1013
00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:50.128
found. Um So the result is that it kind

1014
00:49:50.139 --> 00:49:52.389
of fits right in with other sorts of studies that

1015
00:49:52.398 --> 00:49:54.030
have been published, but improves on them a little

1016
00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:55.739
bit. So it makes that person seem like they're

1017
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:59.329
just that much better than the other people around them

1018
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.059
but not doing something so extraordinary that people immediately doubt

1019
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:07.179
it. So a contrast example for this is um

1020
00:50:07.059 --> 00:50:10.010
in, you know, some years ago, a

1021
00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:15.570
famous paper published in the top journal in social psychology

1022
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.139
claimed to find evidence that people could predict random events

1023
00:50:17.148 --> 00:50:20.469
better than chance, right? So essentially a form

1024
00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:24.059
of psychic ability and the immediate reaction to that was

1025
00:50:24.418 --> 00:50:27.978
no, that's not right. It can't be right

1026
00:50:28.289 --> 00:50:29.989
. Um So the question then is what's wrong with

1027
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.159
it. Um, but that was because it didn't

1028
00:50:32.168 --> 00:50:35.519
fit into what people already believed and it wasn't fraudulent

1029
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.489
. I think he just, it was somebody fooling

1030
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.570
themselves, um, you know, with their analysis

1031
00:50:39.579 --> 00:50:42.159
and there were lots of issues with how they did

1032
00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:45.340
their analysis. But, um, it wasn't fraud

1033
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.989
and that would have been a dumb study to make

1034
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.340
up right, as a fraud because people would immediately

1035
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:52.110
discount it and start digging into it and looking into

1036
00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:54.179
the problems with it. So the things that kind

1037
00:50:54.188 --> 00:50:57.619
of survive as frauds for a while before they get

1038
00:50:57.628 --> 00:51:00.510
caught are typically not outlandish claims. They are typically

1039
00:51:00.969 --> 00:51:05.208
landish just, you know, slightly slightly, you

1040
00:51:05.219 --> 00:51:06.860
know, slightly impressive. They, they land in

1041
00:51:06.869 --> 00:51:09.949
the right spot. They are physically credible enough,

1042
00:51:10.648 --> 00:51:13.550
credible enough, right? They, they, they're

1043
00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:16.860
still impressive, but they're credible enough and credible enough

1044
00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:20.289
within the realm of other things that have been published

1045
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.760
in that area. And that, that's kind of

1046
00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:25.599
the typical finding. So I think a great example

1047
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:30.969
of science working correctly and not necessarily involving fraud is

1048
00:51:30.099 --> 00:51:34.750
, you know, claims of room temperature fusion which

1049
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.668
have come and gone repeatedly over the years in physics

1050
00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:39.489
. Um, there have been cases of fraud in

1051
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:44.250
, in that world, but more often than not

1052
00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.030
, it's just somebody who's, there was something odd

1053
00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:49.329
about the materials they're working with and they didn't figure

1054
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.989
out what it was and it sounded good. So

1055
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.168
they went with the claim that it was, you

1056
00:51:52.179 --> 00:51:55.739
know, called fusion and then physicists immediately dug into

1057
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.889
it because that's a big claim. Right? And

1058
00:51:58.898 --> 00:52:01.489
big claims require very strong evidence and people will dig

1059
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:06.128
into them more. Um, that's, you know

1060
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.010
, that's part of why those sorts of claims garner

1061
00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:09.978
so much attention is that they are out there,

1062
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:14.809
they are a little too far and that's if,

1063
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.708
and they're one of those, if true, that

1064
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:19.039
would be amazing sorts of findings. And anytime you

1065
00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.349
hear, like, if that's true, that would

1066
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.969
be amazing. You should be skeptical about it because

1067
00:52:22.119 --> 00:52:24.199
, you know, amazing breakthroughs are pretty rare.

1068
00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.389
Right? So, getting into the second hook,

1069
00:52:29.398 --> 00:52:34.269
familiarity, I think that we've already mentioned this briefly

1070
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.030
earlier in our conversation. But what does familiarity indicate

1071
00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:42.760
to us? Exactly. So, usually familiarity is

1072
00:52:42.769 --> 00:52:45.628
a great cue to something being trustworthy. So,

1073
00:52:45.938 --> 00:52:47.659
imagine, you know, your friends, your family

1074
00:52:47.668 --> 00:52:51.219
, people, you know, personally, um,

1075
00:52:51.269 --> 00:52:52.969
if you've been around them for a long time,

1076
00:52:52.978 --> 00:52:53.530
you know, whether or not you can trust them

1077
00:52:53.539 --> 00:52:55.148
and you know, how much to trust what they

1078
00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:57.909
say and how much to discount it. Right.

1079
00:52:57.918 --> 00:52:59.688
We all have that relative. We don't trust what

1080
00:52:59.699 --> 00:53:01.239
they say. But for the most part, if

1081
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:06.449
you're around people a lot that familiarity makes it reasonable

1082
00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:09.250
to continue to trust, to accept the truth of

1083
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.789
what they're saying without questioning it as much, it

1084
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.610
makes the truth bias reasonable. Um, and that's

1085
00:53:16.619 --> 00:53:20.398
, that's a great cue for, for us most

1086
00:53:20.409 --> 00:53:22.599
of the time. Um, it becomes a problem

1087
00:53:22.628 --> 00:53:27.699
in terms of deception because we mistake superficial familiarity with

1088
00:53:27.728 --> 00:53:30.550
genuine familiarity. So we see a celebrity a lot

1089
00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:31.829
, we hear a lot of interviews with them.

1090
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:36.000
We kind of feel like we know them and because

1091
00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.128
we kind of feel like we know them, we

1092
00:53:37.139 --> 00:53:38.909
tend not to be as critical when they say something

1093
00:53:39.739 --> 00:53:42.869
, you know, as we should. Um,

1094
00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:47.050
romance scams, um which are a major source of

1095
00:53:47.059 --> 00:53:50.699
scams, financial scams and other sorts of scams right

1096
00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:52.280
now, often targeting older folks who are, are

1097
00:53:52.289 --> 00:53:57.050
lonely, um, divorcees or widowers or widows.

1098
00:53:57.059 --> 00:54:00.619
Um and they, the way they work, it's

1099
00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:05.719
almost entirely online and they establish over time familiarity.

1100
00:54:05.728 --> 00:54:07.539
They feel you feel like you're getting to know this

1101
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.349
person who you're interacting with a lot online, but

1102
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.969
you've never actually met them in person and they probably

1103
00:54:14.978 --> 00:54:15.699
look nothing like what they tell you they do.

1104
00:54:16.039 --> 00:54:21.110
Um And that's those scams are really effective because we

1105
00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:23.989
confuse the sort of familiarity we sort of evolved with

1106
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.869
interacting with people directly having close associates that we know

1107
00:54:28.878 --> 00:54:31.030
really well. Um And can distinguish from people we

1108
00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:35.148
don't know very well. We confuse that with,

1109
00:54:35.159 --> 00:54:37.219
you know, friends on Facebook who you might never

1110
00:54:37.228 --> 00:54:39.148
have met in person or you encounter only on social

1111
00:54:39.159 --> 00:54:44.648
media and people can present a persona um very easily

1112
00:54:44.659 --> 00:54:45.938
. So somebody looking to deceive you is going to

1113
00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:50.329
take advantage of that present themselves like they like a

1114
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.889
friend would and take advantage of that experience of familiarity

1115
00:54:55.739 --> 00:55:00.878
. And what about uh precision? So what does

1116
00:55:00.889 --> 00:55:04.918
it mean to be precise here? And uh but

1117
00:55:04.929 --> 00:55:09.239
basically, how do, how can we distinguish reliable

1118
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:16.128
information from detailed concrete information? That is just BS

1119
00:55:16.809 --> 00:55:19.719
, that's the real challenge, right? And that's

1120
00:55:19.728 --> 00:55:22.320
why these hooks can fool us so easily. Um

1121
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.110
So usually if somebody can give you a precise answer

1122
00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:29.909
and it's grounded, it's based on real evidence.

1123
00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:31.878
That's great. That's really impressive. So that physicist

1124
00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:36.398
who can measure some constant to six decimal places,

1125
00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:37.708
that's great. They can do it reliably, they

1126
00:55:37.719 --> 00:55:40.969
can give you the exact number more or less.

1127
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.309
Um And that precision means that they have great understanding

1128
00:55:45.708 --> 00:55:47.070
. Um a weather forecaster who can say that it's

1129
00:55:47.079 --> 00:55:52.800
going rain will cover 25% of this region uh between

1130
00:55:52.809 --> 00:55:54.688
two and four tomorrow. That's a great prediction that's

1131
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:59.059
precise. Um And to the extent that they are

1132
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:00.619
calibrated and do it well, that means they have

1133
00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:04.449
a good understanding of the weather pattern for that day

1134
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.389
. Um Much better. It's much more informative than

1135
00:56:07.398 --> 00:56:08.619
saying it might or might not rain sometime in the

1136
00:56:08.628 --> 00:56:13.320
next three days. But that doesn't, that doesn't

1137
00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:15.159
have any value to us. So we value precision

1138
00:56:15.168 --> 00:56:19.739
because precision usually is a sign of great understanding.

1139
00:56:20.438 --> 00:56:22.570
The problem of course, is anybody looking to deceive

1140
00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.820
us can just fake precision. They'll give us numbers

1141
00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:27.579
and those numbers don't necessarily have any meaning to them

1142
00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:30.110
. That's where we run into problems that um it's

1143
00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:34.260
very easy to give a precise number and make it

1144
00:56:34.269 --> 00:56:37.938
seem like it's something genuine when there's no actual evidence

1145
00:56:37.949 --> 00:56:43.969
backing it. Mhm. Uh And when, when

1146
00:56:43.978 --> 00:56:45.648
, when it comes to potency, there is the

1147
00:56:45.659 --> 00:56:50.478
last hook. What is it really about? So

1148
00:56:50.489 --> 00:56:53.250
, potency is, are you almost like, you

1149
00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:58.168
know, the desire for big fixes, quick fixes

1150
00:56:58.179 --> 00:57:00.309
that one, you know, this one simple trick

1151
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.159
will fix your problem. And there's a reason why

1152
00:57:04.168 --> 00:57:07.148
that Clickbait works well on, on social media.

1153
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.059
We all want the sort of quick fix the easy

1154
00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:13.039
solution, the, you know, become a master

1155
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:15.699
at something in just a few hours. Um That

1156
00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:19.550
sort of ability to radically change things with the minimal

1157
00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:22.530
effort. So big effects from small, small effort

1158
00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:27.188
, a small intervention, there are rare cases where

1159
00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:30.860
that holds true where a tiny little thing can have

1160
00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:35.590
a gigantic effect. The discovery of antibiotics, vaccines

1161
00:57:35.978 --> 00:57:38.110
, huge consequences from a tiny little thing, right

1162
00:57:38.119 --> 00:57:42.550
? That's um those are, you know, those

1163
00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.168
are rare and few and far between. But we

1164
00:57:45.179 --> 00:57:49.750
have this tendency to kind of assume that things should

1165
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.679
be easier than they are that we can stave off

1166
00:57:52.688 --> 00:57:55.159
the effects of cognitive aging by playing a brain game

1167
00:57:55.168 --> 00:57:58.809
for 10 hours like nope, not gonna work.

1168
00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:01.610
Um But that, that potency, that desire for

1169
00:58:01.619 --> 00:58:06.809
potent effects genuinely is a good thing when it's true

1170
00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:07.958
. It's just that we see it far more often

1171
00:58:07.969 --> 00:58:09.139
than we think we do. And people who are

1172
00:58:09.148 --> 00:58:13.119
looking to deceive us always take advantage of that one

1173
00:58:13.128 --> 00:58:15.280
, right, that they can, who are trying

1174
00:58:15.289 --> 00:58:17.250
to sell us some sort of fake product will always

1175
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.719
claim giant benefits from something that really doesn't have giant

1176
00:58:21.728 --> 00:58:28.010
benefits. Um As a general rule, big consequences

1177
00:58:28.019 --> 00:58:30.250
require big interventions. You, you don't get,

1178
00:58:30.739 --> 00:58:32.648
you don't get a big outcome from a small thing

1179
00:58:34.059 --> 00:58:37.168
. Mhm A and again and again, I imagine

1180
00:58:37.179 --> 00:58:39.019
that here, as we said, it has nothing

1181
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:42.938
to do or very little to do with cognitive ability

1182
00:58:42.949 --> 00:58:45.199
, but with lack of information. Because if,

1183
00:58:45.208 --> 00:58:50.059
for example, you are a scientist of a particular

1184
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:55.659
area and you uh are advertised something uh that promises

1185
00:58:55.668 --> 00:59:00.128
to get huge benefits from very small investment or from

1186
00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:02.909
a very small thing. And you are sort of

1187
00:59:02.918 --> 00:59:06.918
familiar with what they're talking about. They would,

1188
00:59:06.929 --> 00:59:09.019
you would say immediately, oh this is just BS

1189
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:13.260
come on. It's much more complicated than that.

1190
00:59:13.269 --> 00:59:16.394
But people who just lack that sort of knowledge are

1191
00:59:16.405 --> 00:59:22.016
much more vulnerable to that kind of advertisement, for

1192
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.775
example. And even even scientists fall for this sort

1193
00:59:23.784 --> 00:59:25.706
of stuff all the time, right? There is

1194
00:59:25.916 --> 00:59:30.655
, there is an entire field of um what sometimes

1195
00:59:30.666 --> 00:59:32.085
is called social priming where you, you kind of

1196
00:59:32.094 --> 00:59:36.231
flash some words briefly or have people these scramble sentences

1197
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.690
. And the claim was doing that sort of trivial

1198
00:59:37.701 --> 00:59:42.201
task would have these big effects on behavior, right

1199
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:43.851
? That would actually change what you do. And

1200
00:59:43.862 --> 00:59:45.481
it was sort of a cottage industry and social psychology

1201
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:49.141
to generate these effects that were more and more kind

1202
00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:51.822
of outlandish, like, you know, scrambling and

1203
00:59:51.831 --> 00:59:54.592
unscrambling sentences related to being old makes you walk more

1204
00:59:54.601 --> 00:59:59.510
slowly. It just doesn't none of those hold up

1205
00:59:59.721 --> 00:60:02.001
. Um But there are tons and tons of papers

1206
00:60:02.010 --> 00:60:07.530
in the literature on this Um big interventions designed to

1207
00:60:07.539 --> 00:60:10.969
remedy really complex social problems. Um Things like uh

1208
00:60:10.978 --> 00:60:15.429
there, there are a whole series of studies recently

1209
00:60:15.438 --> 00:60:19.369
that are called sometimes called wise interventions and they're called

1210
00:60:19.378 --> 00:60:22.050
wise interventions. The idea is that they don't require

1211
00:60:22.329 --> 00:60:25.309
much effort and they are highly efficient and lead to

1212
00:60:25.320 --> 00:60:28.849
these big outcomes. So their claims that like doing

1213
00:60:28.860 --> 00:60:31.168
a one hour affirmation in a school at the beginning

1214
00:60:31.179 --> 00:60:37.119
of school, uh reduces disparities in suspensions for black

1215
00:60:37.128 --> 00:60:40.030
and white kids um or increases academic achievement two years

1216
00:60:40.039 --> 00:60:43.570
later, like, you know, these are really

1217
00:60:43.579 --> 00:60:47.139
complex multiply determined problems in society, right? The

1218
00:60:47.148 --> 00:60:51.628
suspension gap has there's so many factors that contribute to

1219
00:60:51.639 --> 00:60:54.349
that suspension gap and it's not just something that's going

1220
00:60:54.360 --> 00:60:57.889
to go away with a one hour, you know

1221
00:60:58.050 --> 00:61:02.128
, thinking about yourself intervention. Um but these things

1222
00:61:02.139 --> 00:61:07.079
are pervasive in the schools, um growth mindset interventions

1223
00:61:07.090 --> 00:61:08.760
, you probably have heard of growth mindset. Um

1224
00:61:09.159 --> 00:61:10.539
Yeah. So there are claims that, you know

1225
00:61:10.550 --> 00:61:13.889
, one hour affirmation, you know, one hour

1226
00:61:13.898 --> 00:61:16.030
growth mindset, intervention is going to change your academic

1227
00:61:16.039 --> 00:61:20.199
performance sometime later. Like no, you know,

1228
00:61:20.809 --> 00:61:22.329
that you, you'd be hard pressed to find a

1229
00:61:22.340 --> 00:61:23.889
school district in the United States, at least that

1230
00:61:23.898 --> 00:61:27.760
doesn't apply growth mindset in some way. And it's

1231
00:61:27.769 --> 00:61:30.610
a big industry now. Um If you look,

1232
00:61:30.619 --> 00:61:34.269
there's a recent meta analysis of all of these interventions

1233
00:61:34.789 --> 00:61:37.438
and most of them had severe method problems, most

1234
00:61:37.449 --> 00:61:38.958
of them didn't actually even measure whether the intervention changed

1235
00:61:38.969 --> 00:61:43.510
people's mindsets. Um And if you look at the

1236
00:61:43.519 --> 00:61:45.199
handful of them that did it, well, there's

1237
00:61:45.208 --> 00:61:50.148
basically no effect of these interventions on academic performance or

1238
00:61:50.159 --> 00:61:52.449
outcomes. So it's one of these things where it's

1239
00:61:52.458 --> 00:61:55.489
, you know, a tiny little intervention to address

1240
00:61:55.500 --> 00:62:00.500
something that's a big societal complex problem. And people

1241
00:62:00.510 --> 00:62:04.389
find those really appealing and aren't sufficiently critical of them

1242
00:62:04.398 --> 00:62:07.889
when they, when they are made because as scientists

1243
00:62:07.898 --> 00:62:09.168
, we should be always skeptical of big effects from

1244
00:62:09.179 --> 00:62:13.969
small interventions, but they appeal a lot when they're

1245
00:62:13.978 --> 00:62:15.418
true. And if it were true, it would

1246
00:62:15.429 --> 00:62:15.898
be amazing, right? If, if it were

1247
00:62:15.909 --> 00:62:17.728
true that you could just spend an hour and fix

1248
00:62:17.739 --> 00:62:21.929
a major problem, that would be great. Just

1249
00:62:22.530 --> 00:62:23.289
we tend to find it more appealing than we should

1250
00:62:23.760 --> 00:62:25.429
. Yeah. And I mean, I guess that

1251
00:62:25.438 --> 00:62:30.449
generally speaking, if we're talking about the multifactorial issue

1252
00:62:30.579 --> 00:62:35.708
, if someone claims that just targeting one single factor

1253
00:62:35.719 --> 00:62:38.269
will solve it, uh it's probably not going to

1254
00:62:38.280 --> 00:62:42.329
happen. Yeah. And there's there's a sort of

1255
00:62:42.340 --> 00:62:44.769
, you know, desire to find the single,

1256
00:62:45.148 --> 00:62:47.728
the single solution, the single cause, um fixing

1257
00:62:47.739 --> 00:62:50.800
one thing to fix all the things. And,

1258
00:62:51.398 --> 00:62:55.148
you know, often that's not a terrible approach to

1259
00:62:55.159 --> 00:62:57.628
, to look for, to try and find that

1260
00:62:57.639 --> 00:62:59.820
single cause. This is a common practice in medicine

1261
00:62:59.829 --> 00:63:00.760
, right? If you have somebody who's got a

1262
00:63:00.769 --> 00:63:02.679
bunch of symptoms, you want to look to see

1263
00:63:02.688 --> 00:63:06.148
is there one thing that's causing all the symptoms?

1264
00:63:06.320 --> 00:63:08.909
Um, and often there is, and that's,

1265
00:63:08.918 --> 00:63:13.010
that's the simplest possible explanation for what's going on.

1266
00:63:13.489 --> 00:63:15.510
Uh, in these cases, it's more commonly,

1267
00:63:15.969 --> 00:63:20.099
there's one issue that we want to address. There's

1268
00:63:20.110 --> 00:63:23.750
basically one symptom, say racial disparities in suspensions or

1269
00:63:24.050 --> 00:63:28.550
, um, and we have that one issue but

1270
00:63:28.559 --> 00:63:30.860
it's caused by many, many things and those are

1271
00:63:30.869 --> 00:63:34.360
cases where fixing one of those many, many things

1272
00:63:34.369 --> 00:63:37.500
isn't going to likely have a complete effect on the

1273
00:63:37.510 --> 00:63:39.239
outcome. It's, it works great when you've got

1274
00:63:39.250 --> 00:63:42.309
one cause for many symptoms. It doesn't work so

1275
00:63:42.320 --> 00:63:45.489
great when there's many causes for one symptom. Right

1276
00:63:45.639 --> 00:63:49.010
. So, I have two or three more questions

1277
00:63:49.019 --> 00:63:52.369
before we wrap up the interview about the hooks.

1278
00:63:52.378 --> 00:63:57.719
Is it that the best deceivers out there resort always

1279
00:63:57.728 --> 00:64:00.869
to all four Hooks or can they just resort to

1280
00:64:00.878 --> 00:64:03.300
one or two of them or does it work?

1281
00:64:03.309 --> 00:64:05.289
Exactly. I, I think it, it varies

1282
00:64:05.300 --> 00:64:08.769
a lot. Um, based on what's necessary to

1283
00:64:08.780 --> 00:64:10.648
pull somebody in and what the, what the scope

1284
00:64:10.659 --> 00:64:13.668
of a deception is for something that's just sort of

1285
00:64:13.679 --> 00:64:16.139
AAA, very limited, you know, limited sort

1286
00:64:16.148 --> 00:64:18.840
of fooling somebody just, you know, quick encounter

1287
00:64:18.849 --> 00:64:21.010
where they're just trying to pass off some product they

1288
00:64:21.019 --> 00:64:24.280
might not use more than one or two of these

1289
00:64:24.320 --> 00:64:27.699
. Um, something that's a long running scam,

1290
00:64:28.030 --> 00:64:30.969
um, likely has to adopt a lot more of

1291
00:64:30.978 --> 00:64:33.708
them. So take, uh Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme

1292
00:64:33.719 --> 00:64:35.119
, I think that's a good example of one,

1293
00:64:35.128 --> 00:64:40.159
you know, ran for 15 plus years um where

1294
00:64:40.168 --> 00:64:42.628
he didn't process a single transaction, they were all

1295
00:64:42.639 --> 00:64:47.188
faked for for that longer duration. And so he

1296
00:64:47.570 --> 00:64:49.418
, you know, he, he used focus to

1297
00:64:49.429 --> 00:64:51.829
some extent because he's going to give you the information

1298
00:64:51.840 --> 00:64:55.398
, you want your returns but not tell you all

1299
00:64:55.409 --> 00:64:57.688
of the details about how he managed to do that

1300
00:64:58.119 --> 00:64:59.780
. You know the missing information. He's counting on

1301
00:64:59.789 --> 00:65:00.918
you not asking how is it that you managed to

1302
00:65:00.929 --> 00:65:03.510
get identical returns month to month, year to year

1303
00:65:03.760 --> 00:65:08.208
because nobody else can. Um So most people don't

1304
00:65:08.219 --> 00:65:10.958
ask that most people don't ask for more information than

1305
00:65:10.969 --> 00:65:14.789
he provides. And he, he um he set

1306
00:65:14.800 --> 00:65:17.019
people up to expect the same returns every year.

1307
00:65:17.250 --> 00:65:19.769
They would get their 8 to 14% every year,

1308
00:65:19.780 --> 00:65:23.679
not having any down years. And as long as

1309
00:65:23.688 --> 00:65:26.829
they kept getting what they expected, people didn't complain

1310
00:65:26.918 --> 00:65:28.239
, they didn't question it. If they had a

1311
00:65:28.250 --> 00:65:29.659
big down year, he would have, they would

1312
00:65:29.668 --> 00:65:30.860
have questioned it, but he gave them what they

1313
00:65:30.869 --> 00:65:33.188
expected. He counted on commitments as we already discussed

1314
00:65:33.199 --> 00:65:36.958
that people trusted him and they didn't think he would

1315
00:65:36.969 --> 00:65:39.739
be ever the sort of person who would screw them

1316
00:65:39.750 --> 00:65:43.039
over. He was also familiar to many of the

1317
00:65:43.050 --> 00:65:45.570
people who invested with him. He uh specifically targeted

1318
00:65:45.579 --> 00:65:47.708
members of his social community in New York, e

1319
00:65:47.719 --> 00:65:51.688
especially um he selected the people who could invest with

1320
00:65:51.699 --> 00:65:55.039
him. Um He didn't just let anybody invest with

1321
00:65:55.050 --> 00:65:57.530
him, he would turn people away. Um So

1322
00:65:57.539 --> 00:65:59.389
he selected the people who he was, he was

1323
00:65:59.398 --> 00:66:01.719
in, who are investing with him. Um He

1324
00:66:01.728 --> 00:66:05.168
used precision. So he would give people this huge

1325
00:66:05.179 --> 00:66:09.159
print out of every of records of trades that were

1326
00:66:09.168 --> 00:66:12.929
all fabricated um in their, you know, in

1327
00:66:12.938 --> 00:66:15.409
their reports, it wasn't online like it would be

1328
00:66:15.418 --> 00:66:16.458
for most major investors. It was just all of

1329
00:66:16.469 --> 00:66:19.668
these trade transaction forms. So lots of detail there

1330
00:66:20.099 --> 00:66:21.750
that just didn't have anything backing it. It was

1331
00:66:21.760 --> 00:66:24.110
, it was a perfect example of, you know

1332
00:66:24.119 --> 00:66:27.250
, giving precise information without any substance to it.

1333
00:66:27.840 --> 00:66:30.070
Um Potency, maybe he didn't use a whole lot

1334
00:66:30.079 --> 00:66:33.610
because we think of potency as the classic Ponzi scheme

1335
00:66:33.619 --> 00:66:38.929
where invest now and you're guaranteed 50% returns in six

1336
00:66:38.938 --> 00:66:41.119
months. He never did that. In fact,

1337
00:66:41.128 --> 00:66:43.550
he kind of performed about the same as the S

1338
00:66:43.559 --> 00:66:45.340
and P 500 the major stock index over the course

1339
00:66:45.349 --> 00:66:48.610
of his Ponzi scheme. His investment wasn't that outstanding

1340
00:66:48.619 --> 00:66:51.639
? It was just stable. It was, you

1341
00:66:51.648 --> 00:66:55.728
never had a down year with Bernie. Um So

1342
00:66:55.929 --> 00:66:58.889
he used consistency a lot more than he used potency

1343
00:66:59.458 --> 00:67:00.409
. But yeah, I mean, he, he

1344
00:67:00.418 --> 00:67:02.579
used a lot of these techniques and how he went

1345
00:67:02.590 --> 00:67:05.708
about it, which in a way perhaps made it

1346
00:67:05.719 --> 00:67:10.250
even more grabbable. Yeah. Well, in order

1347
00:67:10.260 --> 00:67:11.918
to keep it, keep it going that long,

1348
00:67:12.119 --> 00:67:13.829
he would have to tap into a lot of the

1349
00:67:13.840 --> 00:67:15.769
sort of ways of thinking that keep people from questioning

1350
00:67:15.780 --> 00:67:18.449
the truth of what he's saying. So, yeah

1351
00:67:18.469 --> 00:67:21.110
, that's, that's, that's right. The longer

1352
00:67:21.119 --> 00:67:23.869
something goes, the more complex it is, the

1353
00:67:23.878 --> 00:67:26.530
more they're going to have to rely on deceiving you

1354
00:67:26.539 --> 00:67:30.378
in different ways. Uh And another question I have

1355
00:67:30.389 --> 00:67:33.559
here is so we've already mentioned several times how this

1356
00:67:33.570 --> 00:67:38.128
has very little or nothing to do with people's cognitive

1357
00:67:38.139 --> 00:67:42.019
ability or any other kind of psychological threats. But

1358
00:67:42.030 --> 00:67:46.099
isn't it the case that many times scammers or receivers

1359
00:67:46.110 --> 00:67:51.110
target specific vulnerable people? Of course, to do

1360
00:67:51.119 --> 00:67:55.668
that, they have to have specific kinds of information

1361
00:67:55.679 --> 00:67:58.570
about specific people. I mean, some, sometimes

1362
00:67:58.579 --> 00:68:01.398
they target just the elderly in general, sometimes they

1363
00:68:01.409 --> 00:68:05.829
might target very specific niches of people. Like for

1364
00:68:05.840 --> 00:68:09.800
example, if it's a romantic scam, they might

1365
00:68:09.809 --> 00:68:12.739
target people that they know are single and do not

1366
00:68:12.750 --> 00:68:15.168
like to be single or something like that. But

1367
00:68:15.378 --> 00:68:16.640
I, I mean, it's also the case that

1368
00:68:16.899 --> 00:68:23.600
uh the, some of the most successful scammers are

1369
00:68:23.609 --> 00:68:28.500
also the ones that know who to target. So

1370
00:68:28.509 --> 00:68:30.600
there are two different approaches, right? And there

1371
00:68:30.609 --> 00:68:32.649
undoubtedly are some people who are more gullible than others

1372
00:68:32.659 --> 00:68:34.890
. There are going to be individual differences there.

1373
00:68:34.989 --> 00:68:38.770
I don't think that's the defining factor in whether or

1374
00:68:38.779 --> 00:68:40.159
not somebody can be scammed. So I think the

1375
00:68:40.168 --> 00:68:43.378
danger is in assuming that because you're a smart critical

1376
00:68:43.390 --> 00:68:45.837
thinker that you can't be, can't be deceived.

1377
00:68:46.158 --> 00:68:51.390
Um That's undoubtedly wrong. Uh The, the idea

1378
00:68:51.399 --> 00:68:54.000
that some people are more likely to be seed than

1379
00:68:54.009 --> 00:68:58.668
others is certainly true and some people are more easy

1380
00:68:58.680 --> 00:69:00.899
to target than others. But there are two different

1381
00:69:00.909 --> 00:69:03.640
approaches that scammers can take. One is uh to

1382
00:69:03.649 --> 00:69:08.890
specifically learn a lot about a person and meet them

1383
00:69:08.899 --> 00:69:11.250
where they are. So, yeah, if you're

1384
00:69:11.259 --> 00:69:14.449
a romance scammer, you're not going to target somebody

1385
00:69:14.458 --> 00:69:16.469
who's happily married. That's just not going to be

1386
00:69:16.479 --> 00:69:19.917
an effective target. If you are using the calling

1387
00:69:19.929 --> 00:69:24.099
card scam, which is a standard tactic or the

1388
00:69:24.108 --> 00:69:28.139
call center scam where people will call up people targeting

1389
00:69:28.148 --> 00:69:31.979
them for a particular uh fear. So often in

1390
00:69:32.389 --> 00:69:34.769
the scams are often based out of other countries.

1391
00:69:34.778 --> 00:69:38.139
And then we'll call in to say the United States

1392
00:69:38.389 --> 00:69:40.788
and we will target people who are here on a

1393
00:69:40.797 --> 00:69:44.509
limited visa status or, or here illegally and we

1394
00:69:44.520 --> 00:69:46.819
threaten them with deportation or with arrest unless they pay

1395
00:69:46.829 --> 00:69:49.310
up right away. That scam is not going to

1396
00:69:49.319 --> 00:69:51.708
work on me. It's no work on somebody who

1397
00:69:51.720 --> 00:69:55.708
is an immigrant. Um And there are variants of

1398
00:69:55.720 --> 00:69:57.289
it that will work. There are variants of that

1399
00:69:57.298 --> 00:69:58.890
, that work on professors, right? There's a

1400
00:69:59.168 --> 00:70:00.739
, there's a variant of this right now, which

1401
00:70:00.750 --> 00:70:03.149
is really clever. So if you are a professor

1402
00:70:03.159 --> 00:70:06.810
who gives invited talks at conferences, um on occasion

1403
00:70:08.338 --> 00:70:12.390
, uh quite often the conference organizers will arrange your

1404
00:70:12.399 --> 00:70:15.259
hotel and some of your travel for you. So

1405
00:70:15.600 --> 00:70:18.539
um there's a con right now that's working pretty effectively

1406
00:70:18.850 --> 00:70:23.680
um where the con artist will look at the conferences

1407
00:70:23.689 --> 00:70:26.560
, figure out who's invited to speak. And we

1408
00:70:26.569 --> 00:70:29.418
call those people and pretend to be the conference organizers

1409
00:70:29.430 --> 00:70:32.579
to arrange their travel and they'll arrange their hotel and

1410
00:70:32.588 --> 00:70:34.529
flight information, which means they get all of their

1411
00:70:34.539 --> 00:70:38.770
personal information and their credit card and they have nothing

1412
00:70:38.779 --> 00:70:40.060
to do with the conference. They just looked up

1413
00:70:40.069 --> 00:70:43.958
the information and targeted. So again, professors can

1414
00:70:43.970 --> 00:70:46.939
fall for this and have. Um So that's one

1415
00:70:46.949 --> 00:70:49.970
approach is the specific targeting. The other approach is

1416
00:70:49.979 --> 00:70:54.359
to allow the victims to select themselves. Um So

1417
00:70:54.369 --> 00:70:57.689
I don't know if you have this particular scam in

1418
00:70:57.699 --> 00:71:00.939
, in Portugal, but uh where you get an

1419
00:71:00.949 --> 00:71:02.989
automated call asking you about extending your cars warranty.

1420
00:71:03.000 --> 00:71:05.289
Do you guys have that one? I got that

1421
00:71:05.298 --> 00:71:11.390
not about a car warranty about other things, but

1422
00:71:11.399 --> 00:71:13.250
yeah, I, I got, I got that

1423
00:71:13.259 --> 00:71:15.829
kind of thing. So these are these robocalls.

1424
00:71:15.838 --> 00:71:16.680
It's like most people like, yeah, those are

1425
00:71:16.689 --> 00:71:21.399
scam. Um But the people who call it back

1426
00:71:21.409 --> 00:71:25.739
have just identified themselves as somebody who is a target

1427
00:71:26.609 --> 00:71:29.079
. It's somebody who is concerned about their car's warranty

1428
00:71:29.270 --> 00:71:30.520
. So they, they self identified. So the

1429
00:71:30.529 --> 00:71:34.149
scammers there don't have to waste any time selecting people

1430
00:71:34.399 --> 00:71:35.838
. All they have to do is just blast it

1431
00:71:35.850 --> 00:71:38.479
out to as many people as possible. And then

1432
00:71:38.489 --> 00:71:42.060
some people will respond same thing with the original Nigerian

1433
00:71:42.069 --> 00:71:44.319
prints email scam, which has been going on for

1434
00:71:44.329 --> 00:71:45.750
decades now. It, it was, it existed

1435
00:71:45.759 --> 00:71:49.560
before email. Um as, as letters. Um

1436
00:71:49.569 --> 00:71:54.338
But the idea of that scam is they can send

1437
00:71:54.350 --> 00:71:57.359
out now millions of those emails, most of which

1438
00:71:57.369 --> 00:72:00.298
look ridiculous, right? Most people are not going

1439
00:72:00.310 --> 00:72:02.140
to fall for that. Um There's bad grammar.

1440
00:72:02.149 --> 00:72:03.878
It's weird, you know, I still get these

1441
00:72:03.890 --> 00:72:06.850
in my inbox, um mostly caught by the spam

1442
00:72:06.859 --> 00:72:11.000
filters now. But um, but if you think

1443
00:72:11.009 --> 00:72:13.829
about it, they're not trying to reach you or

1444
00:72:13.838 --> 00:72:16.329
me. They're trying to reach those very small number

1445
00:72:16.338 --> 00:72:19.199
of people who have not heard of this scam and

1446
00:72:19.208 --> 00:72:23.039
who will respond to that email. So they want

1447
00:72:23.048 --> 00:72:25.759
to make it as obvious as possible so that they

1448
00:72:25.770 --> 00:72:27.819
don't have to waste any time with people who aren't

1449
00:72:27.829 --> 00:72:30.259
going to eventually pay up. They want only the

1450
00:72:30.270 --> 00:72:31.000
most gullible, they want the person who calls back

1451
00:72:31.009 --> 00:72:34.140
about their car's warranty. So anybody who responds to

1452
00:72:34.149 --> 00:72:38.970
that email is a likely target and it's cost efficient

1453
00:72:38.979 --> 00:72:40.759
for them because they don't have to waste time with

1454
00:72:40.770 --> 00:72:42.500
all of the people who are more skeptical of that

1455
00:72:42.509 --> 00:72:46.088
particular email. So, yeah, they scams are

1456
00:72:46.100 --> 00:72:48.350
targeted in, in different sorts of ways either by

1457
00:72:48.359 --> 00:72:51.708
selecting and really getting to know the people you're,

1458
00:72:51.720 --> 00:72:55.640
they're trying to victimize or by allowing people to select

1459
00:72:55.649 --> 00:73:00.649
themselves. So, my last question, then I

1460
00:73:00.659 --> 00:73:04.159
guess that we can say here that there's no foolproof

1461
00:73:04.168 --> 00:73:10.798
way of being able to always identify the scammers and

1462
00:73:10.810 --> 00:73:14.079
the deceivers. But I guess that the point of

1463
00:73:14.088 --> 00:73:17.399
your book here is for people to be more aware

1464
00:73:17.409 --> 00:73:20.824
of the fact that we have this sort of psychological

1465
00:73:20.833 --> 00:73:26.673
habits, this truth bias and to perhaps in specific

1466
00:73:26.685 --> 00:73:31.744
situations, be more aware and wary of certain things

1467
00:73:31.753 --> 00:73:35.364
that people say and, and perhaps ask more questions

1468
00:73:35.375 --> 00:73:39.904
in specific situations as well and stuff like that.

1469
00:73:40.208 --> 00:73:45.668
Uh Because most of the time our proof bias still

1470
00:73:45.680 --> 00:73:47.279
works. Most of the time, all of these

1471
00:73:47.289 --> 00:73:50.869
things still work. Um Most of the time,

1472
00:73:50.878 --> 00:73:54.489
none of us are very few of us are going

1473
00:73:54.500 --> 00:73:56.819
to be victims of a grand con, right?

1474
00:73:56.838 --> 00:73:59.569
Most of us are not going to succumb to that

1475
00:73:59.759 --> 00:74:01.720
. We'll, we'll all be fooled by misinformation at

1476
00:74:01.729 --> 00:74:04.000
times. We'll all be fooled by deception and every

1477
00:74:04.009 --> 00:74:05.600
now and then we'll get taken for some money by

1478
00:74:05.609 --> 00:74:09.770
somebody who's trying to rip us off. But most

1479
00:74:09.779 --> 00:74:11.539
of us are not going to be a victim of

1480
00:74:11.548 --> 00:74:15.039
a grand scam of the Madoff variety. Um,

1481
00:74:15.048 --> 00:74:16.628
fortunately, um, but I think, I think

1482
00:74:16.640 --> 00:74:18.949
your first point is exactly right that, you know

1483
00:74:18.958 --> 00:74:20.020
, you'd like to think. Oh, is there

1484
00:74:20.029 --> 00:74:24.159
a quick, quick fix an easy solution to not

1485
00:74:24.168 --> 00:74:26.600
ever being scammed? And that would, that would

1486
00:74:26.609 --> 00:74:29.810
be tapping into the hook of potency if I promised

1487
00:74:29.819 --> 00:74:30.609
you that if I, if I said here's all

1488
00:74:30.619 --> 00:74:32.720
you have to do to avoid ever being scammed,

1489
00:74:33.359 --> 00:74:36.739
there is no such thing and we should know that

1490
00:74:36.750 --> 00:74:41.479
after reading about the potency that there's no one quick

1491
00:74:41.489 --> 00:74:45.039
fix for a really complex multifaceted problem. Um But

1492
00:74:45.048 --> 00:74:47.899
I do think there's an advantage in learning about these

1493
00:74:47.909 --> 00:74:51.159
hooks. Um It's a lifelong process to think about

1494
00:74:51.168 --> 00:74:54.229
when you need to be skeptical and when you shouldn't

1495
00:74:54.239 --> 00:74:57.100
. But all of these hooks and habits are things

1496
00:74:57.109 --> 00:75:00.859
that underlie almost all forms of deception so far known

1497
00:75:00.869 --> 00:75:04.509
and likely to exist in the future. And as

1498
00:75:04.520 --> 00:75:08.829
you start kind of recognizing the patterns, you might

1499
00:75:08.838 --> 00:75:11.250
start recognizing when they're at play in times when you're

1500
00:75:11.259 --> 00:75:14.359
at risk. So, um one of the strategies

1501
00:75:14.369 --> 00:75:16.140
that I think is probably helpful is next time you're

1502
00:75:16.149 --> 00:75:19.069
listening to a story about a con or reading an

1503
00:75:19.079 --> 00:75:23.958
article about somebody who is taken in, think about

1504
00:75:24.000 --> 00:75:27.029
how this con artist applied these hooks and habits.

1505
00:75:27.350 --> 00:75:30.890
Um Think about from the victim's perspective, which red

1506
00:75:30.899 --> 00:75:32.548
flags did they miss because they were too focused or

1507
00:75:32.560 --> 00:75:35.949
because they didn't ask another question when you start examining

1508
00:75:36.128 --> 00:75:39.039
the scans and scams in that way, kind of

1509
00:75:39.048 --> 00:75:40.770
as we did over the course of doing our research

1510
00:75:40.779 --> 00:75:43.259
for the book, you start to see the patterns

1511
00:75:43.270 --> 00:75:45.759
and you start to recognizing, start to recognize when

1512
00:75:45.770 --> 00:75:46.500
something is maybe a little too good to be true

1513
00:75:46.680 --> 00:75:49.338
. Um So I think it's, I think that's

1514
00:75:49.350 --> 00:75:54.000
the best approach in general is to try and understand

1515
00:75:54.009 --> 00:75:56.250
it from the perspective of the, of the victim

1516
00:75:56.259 --> 00:75:59.779
in that moment and how they were targeted and how

1517
00:75:59.789 --> 00:76:03.359
they um how the con artist applied these tricks,

1518
00:76:03.369 --> 00:76:06.970
um took advantage of them. Great. So the

1519
00:76:06.979 --> 00:76:10.600
book is again, nobody is full. Why we

1520
00:76:10.609 --> 00:76:12.659
get taken in and what we can do about it

1521
00:76:12.668 --> 00:76:14.689
. I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1522
00:76:14.699 --> 00:76:16.869
box down below. And Doctor Simons, apart from

1523
00:76:16.878 --> 00:76:19.329
the book, would you like also to tell people

1524
00:76:19.338 --> 00:76:21.729
where they can find you and your work on the
