00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.029
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:05.789
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.600
joined by Doctor Daniel Simons. He is a professor

4
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.880
in the Department of Psychology at the University of

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.149
Illinois where he also directs the visual cognition laboratory.

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.690
And today we're focusing on his latest book together

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.920
with Dr Christopher Chabris, who I've already have on

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.120
the show, by the way, nobody is fo why

9
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.530
we get taken in and what we can do

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.319
about it. So Dr Simons, welcome to the show.

11
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.360
It's a big pleasure to everyone. Thank you for

12
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.560
having me on. So tell us perhaps first a

13
00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.310
little bit about the premise of the book. I

14
00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:40.950
mean, I even have a quote here where you

15
00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:46.340
say that it's basically about exploring the cognitive psychology

16
00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:49.779
of the cheat, the patterns of thinking and reasoning

17
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.889
that make us all vulnerable to deception. Could you

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.650
explain that?

19
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.409
Yeah. And that's the broad theme of the book.

20
00:00:56.419 --> 00:01:00.009
We took a look over many years at scams

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.409
and, and cons and just regular run of the

22
00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:05.730
mill deception across a wide range of disciplines, everything

23
00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:09.790
from investment fraud to cheating in chess to try

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.199
and see whether there were any commonalities across all

25
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.900
of them. And what we started to realize was

26
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.069
that there were some common tendencies that we all

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.709
have that make it possible for people to take

28
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.809
advantage of us. And there are tendencies that work

29
00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.639
well most of the time. But that when somebody

30
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.040
is looking to take advantage of us, they co

31
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.620
opt them or hijack them for their own purposes.

32
00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.029
So that was one theme that we found that

33
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.089
was really consistent across a wide range of kinds

34
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:39.459
of deception. The other was that any of us

35
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.459
can be fooled. We, we have this kind of

36
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.089
intuition that and belief that when you hear about

37
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:46.790
a fraud, you hear about somebody falling for a

38
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.029
scam. In retrospect, you can see all the red

39
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.029
flags they missed, you can see everything that they

40
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.319
didn't notice along the way. And that makes it

41
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.839
seem like they must be clueless or naive or

42
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.900
gullible. But the reality is that the scammers just

43
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.639
happen to target them well, for that particular scam

44
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.519
and any of us, no matter how educated, smart,

45
00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:12.449
skeptical, critical thinking we are can be victimized if

46
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.389
the targeting is aimed at us.

47
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.300
Yeah. And we'll get into some of the aspects

48
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.070
of human cognition that you explore in the book

49
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.199
that make us susceptible, all of us susceptible to

50
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.932
deception. And I guess that that's uh very good

51
00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:32.292
point because actually, I mean, almost every single time

52
00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:36.453
that we hear about someone falling for what, for

53
00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:39.182
us from the outside seems like a very basic

54
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.742
scam. We're always like, oh, it's because the person

55
00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:46.132
was really gullible or stupid or dumb. Or it's

56
00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:50.052
because she's low in intelligence. But that doesn't seem

57
00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.315
to be really the case, at least most of

58
00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:52.826
the time.

59
00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.955
Exactly. And, and there's, there's so much entertainment industry

60
00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:59.546
depiction of cons and scams. Right. And you can

61
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:01.776
go to the theater and see a heist movie,

62
00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.126
you can listen to a podcast and hear all

63
00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:06.906
about a con artist. But whenever you do that,

64
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:10.205
you know that there's deception taking place, you, you

65
00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:13.195
are watching it knowing that it's about deception, which

66
00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.106
means that you're looking for all of those hallmarks,

67
00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:16.735
you're treating it more like a mystery where you're

68
00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:18.940
trying to figure out where they went wrong. But

69
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.500
when somebody is immersed in the narrative themselves, when

70
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.520
they're, when they're the target of it, they don't

71
00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:26.770
see it from that outside perspective, they only see

72
00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.660
what they're being provided and that can lead to

73
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.940
anybody if it's targeted, appropriately being

74
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.619
fooled. But do you think that there is good

75
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.770
evidence that we have sort of a truth bias

76
00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.710
that is that we most of the time tend

77
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.625
to believe or have this tendency to believe at

78
00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:48.615
face value on what people are, what other people

79
00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:52.304
are saying? And I mean, if so, is that

80
00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.785
really a problem? Because isn't it that at least

81
00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:59.304
most of the time, there's very good reasons to

82
00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:02.945
think that what someone is saying is actually true.

83
00:04:03.264 --> 00:04:03.764
Yeah.

84
00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:05.625
Absolutely. And most of the time nobody's trying to

85
00:04:05.634 --> 00:04:09.024
deceive us. So it makes sense for us to

86
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:11.634
accept what we're hearing is true most of the

87
00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:14.320
time. That's what we call a truth bias. That

88
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:15.729
the idea of a truth bias is a little

89
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.010
more nuanced than, than just accepting everything is true.

90
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.920
It's the idea that whenever we hear something, whenever

91
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:25.899
somebody tells us something, our initial evaluation of what

92
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.299
they've said assumes it's true regardless of what it

93
00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.480
is. And then it takes a little bit of

94
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.309
time or a little bit of effort to rip

95
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.109
it apart if we think it's wrong. So, and

96
00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:39.070
you know, it's easier in some context than others.

97
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.579
If somebody says something that we firmly don't believe

98
00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:44.140
or there's somebody that we don't ever trust, we

99
00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.559
know not to trust them, we're going to discount

100
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.339
what they say pretty quickly. But um, we have

101
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.809
to take in what they're saying, process it make

102
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.079
sense of it. And part of that is kind

103
00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.209
of like the need to accept that it's real

104
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.760
that it's true before we then debunk it. So

105
00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:01.739
a truth bias is really a functional thing. We

106
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.660
have to have that otherwise we couldn't interact with

107
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.559
anybody around us, our society would not be able

108
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.309
to function. We have to trust that most of

109
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.609
the time what we're hearing is true. And that's

110
00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.880
the base rate for that is good, right? That,

111
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.399
that's actually what we want to be doing. Um

112
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.769
The trick comes in how people who are trying

113
00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.059
to deceive us, take advantage of that. They'll give

114
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.010
us some information that's not true, but then not

115
00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.920
give us the opportunity to tear it apart or

116
00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.079
to critique it or to realize that it's false?

117
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.920
And are there specific conditions where people remain uncertain

118
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:38.149
or skeptical of what someone claims? I mean, are

119
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.440
there specific situations, cases conditions where uh I mean,

120
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.950
even though for most situations, if someone just says

121
00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:53.529
something that doesn't trigger in us, I mean, our

122
00:05:53.589 --> 00:06:00.244
perhaps uh uh deception uh detecting or a device

123
00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:03.095
or something like that. Uh I mean, that, that

124
00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:06.845
we e even then think, OK, so in this

125
00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:11.434
particular case, I will remain skeptical until I learn

126
00:06:11.445 --> 00:06:12.484
a little bit more.

127
00:06:13.054 --> 00:06:14.625
So I think we often do that we should

128
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:17.375
do it a lot more remaining uncertain is probably

129
00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:20.640
the best thing we could do to avoid spreading

130
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.269
unintentionally spreading misinformation or repeating falsehoods. I if you

131
00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.359
remain uncertain a little bit longer and look for

132
00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:31.140
more information, that's a great strategy to make sure

133
00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:35.529
you're not being fooled. Um And there, there certainly

134
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.950
are going to be context when we are going

135
00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.089
to do that, right? We're going to be more

136
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.489
willing to be skeptical when it's something that we

137
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.410
had doubts about to begin with when it kind

138
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.160
of ran counter to our beliefs or our ideology

139
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.559
or our, you know, willing. So if somebody, for

140
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.940
example, provides scientific evidence, claims to provide scientific evidence

141
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.440
for ESP um I don't believe that's likely to

142
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.299
be true. I think there's plenty of good reasons

143
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.149
not to believe that that's true. Um As a

144
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.369
scientist, I should remain uncertain as long as I

145
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.059
can until the evidence becomes overwhelming. In that particular

146
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.299
case, I think it's pretty overwhelming, but let's say

147
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:13.089
that somebody provides some evidence for something that I

148
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.829
don't agree with, I don't think is likely to

149
00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.190
be true, but it might be, well, that's a

150
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.890
context in which I should remain uncertain a little

151
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.140
bit longer. I should be willing to accept the

152
00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.989
possibility that I was wrong um initially or that

153
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.670
the evidence that they're providing is wrong and that,

154
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:32.500
that's a great strategy to use. It's one that

155
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.299
we should use a lot more than we do.

156
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:37.179
Uh INCLUDING scientists, scientists don't remain uncertain as much

157
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.290
as they should. They're much more willing to take

158
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:42.980
on a strong belief and then discount anything that

159
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:46.230
runs counter to it. But we should remain uncertain

160
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.230
until the evidence is clear. The problem is we

161
00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:51.239
rarely have the time or energy or willingness to

162
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.989
do all of the digging that we need to,

163
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.470
to show that it's actually clear.

164
00:07:56.109 --> 00:08:00.130
Mhm And so let's get into the aspects of

165
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.709
human cognition you explore in the book that really

166
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.140
makes uh make us all susceptible to some, at

167
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:10.500
least some degree of deception. So you talk about

168
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.390
four different things, focus prediction, commitment and deficiency in

169
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.070
the book. So starting with focus, what is this

170
00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.130
really about?

171
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:22.579
Yeah. So those four, those four elements are what

172
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:25.790
we call habits. So there are cognitive tendencies that

173
00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:27.720
apply most of the time in our daily lives,

174
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.519
the things that we have to do that usually

175
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:33.900
are really, really effective for us. So focus is

176
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:38.159
the idea that we primarily direct our attention to

177
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.450
what we have right in front of us. The

178
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.090
information that we have most of the time, the

179
00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.909
information we have is the information we need. So

180
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.140
it makes sense to focus on what we're doing,

181
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.330
what we're looking at what we're thinking about at

182
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.909
that moment. Um The challenge of focus is that

183
00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:56.390
we often don't realize when we don't have information

184
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.140
that we might actually need and that's where we

185
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.520
run into problems. Um So the idea of focus

186
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.590
is that most of the time we use the

187
00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:06.549
information at hand to do what we need to

188
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:08.190
do with it, to make sense of the world.

189
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.700
And that's usually a great thing and we usually

190
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.469
don't have to worry about all of the other

191
00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:14.450
stuff that would just be distractions from the thing

192
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.299
we want to pay attention to. The problem comes

193
00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:21.260
when the things that we're missing really should be

194
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.900
influencing our judgments, our decisions or our reactions to

195
00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.820
the world and people who are looking to deceive

196
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.960
us will deliberately focus your attention on one thing.

197
00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:35.270
So, if you've ever been to a magician's show,

198
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.570
a magic show, the magician is going to direct

199
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.359
your attention, they're going to get you to focus

200
00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:42.169
on the effect what they're wanting you to see

201
00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:44.859
and away from the method, the hidden information that

202
00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:48.400
they're trying to, um, that they're trying to keep

203
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:50.549
away from you and they're going to do lots

204
00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:52.330
of things to focus your attention. They're going to

205
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.609
have a lot of witty banter and joking that

206
00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:56.409
gets you focused on what they're saying and not

207
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:59.219
what they're doing. But again, the idea is we

208
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:01.280
focus on a limited amount of information. We can't

209
00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:04.229
focus on everything. And the end result of that

210
00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:06.859
is sometimes the things that we're not focusing on

211
00:10:06.869 --> 00:10:08.539
are things we need to pay attention to.

212
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.380
Uh YOU mentioned magicians there. But I guess that

213
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.059
there's another instance where people really try to make

214
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.030
us focus on just the positive aspects of, of

215
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.890
something and make us lose focus of the perhaps

216
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.979
more negative aspects of something. Like, for example, when

217
00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:32.000
uh a company is trying to sell uh uh

218
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.979
uh its products, I, I mean, in advertisement and

219
00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:39.520
all of that advertisement is basically all about that,

220
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.299
right? It's basically about focus and just focusing on

221
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:47.820
the positive aspects of products. So how do they

222
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.179
do that? Exactly.

223
00:10:49.255 --> 00:10:51.784
Well, I mean, that, that's, they're just taking advantage

224
00:10:51.794 --> 00:10:54.044
of the fact that we do that naturally. So,

225
00:10:54.164 --> 00:10:56.315
advertising, I don't tend to think of advertising in

226
00:10:56.325 --> 00:11:00.474
the same light as cons and deceptions. Um, THERE

227
00:11:00.484 --> 00:11:01.914
they have a goal, they want you to think

228
00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:04.424
about their product and not alternative products. They want

229
00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:07.315
you to be directed attention to the positive features

230
00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:09.304
of their product and not to the negative ones.

231
00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:12.695
Right. So, um, so what do they do? They

232
00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:15.674
just don't present the negative ones, they present only

233
00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.989
the positive ones and we tend to kind of

234
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.659
think that those are representatives. So I think one

235
00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:24.229
of the best examples of this is um demos.

236
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.190
So uh showing a video of a car driving

237
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.489
itself and we see that video and say, wow,

238
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.960
OK, I could, I would love to be able

239
00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:35.299
to do that and just read a book while

240
00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:38.190
the car is driving me to work. Um And

241
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.429
we think about all of the possible ways that

242
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.929
that same process could generalize. We assume that what

243
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.349
we're seeing is representative of what that car can

244
00:11:47.359 --> 00:11:50.559
do. Um And we don't think about all of

245
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.960
the things that they haven't shown us things like

246
00:11:52.969 --> 00:11:55.510
how many times did they try and do that

247
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.179
demo before it worked once? Um How many times

248
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.320
did the car drive off the side of the

249
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.880
road? How many times did it run a stop

250
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.590
light or a stop sign? Um We don't think

251
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.169
about those sorts of things. Does it only work

252
00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:08.590
on straight roads? Does it only work in perfect

253
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:11.390
sunlight conditions or would it not work if it's

254
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.109
raining? What if a pedestrian ran out into the

255
00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.659
road? We don't tend to think about those things

256
00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:18.260
in real time while watching this demo. Instead, we

257
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.919
take it as representative, our focus on that demo

258
00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:24.309
take treats it as typical of what happens in

259
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.080
the world and the end result is we just

260
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.469
don't think about the information we don't have. So

261
00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:32.450
advertisers aren't having to do a whole lot to

262
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.940
get us to focus on their product. All they

263
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.489
have to do is present the information they want

264
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.729
us to have and they can kind of count

265
00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:39.549
on us not thinking about the information we don't

266
00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:42.669
have unless they say something really egregious, then we

267
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.460
might take a step back and say, wait a

268
00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:47.250
second. Is that really true? And think about it,

269
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.909
in which case they've lost us, that's not what

270
00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:50.710
they want us to do.

271
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.010
And I guess, I guess that apart from the

272
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.840
product, something that they do often is that they

273
00:12:57.849 --> 00:13:01.799
present next to the product, high status or very

274
00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:05.679
famous people, right? And that's another thing that perhaps

275
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.275
make us lose focus on some of the potential

276
00:13:09.284 --> 00:13:12.354
negative aspects of the products. Right. Sure.

277
00:13:12.364 --> 00:13:14.424
And that, that's actually tapping into one of the

278
00:13:14.434 --> 00:13:15.864
hooks that I guess we'll talk about in a

279
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:19.344
little bit of familiarity. As well. It's, it's tapping

280
00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:21.354
into the idea that for somebody who's a very

281
00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:23.325
famous person we kind of feel like we know

282
00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:26.645
them even though we really don't. And that familiarity

283
00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:29.604
makes us trust things more. So. Yeah, they, they

284
00:13:29.614 --> 00:13:31.494
use a lot of the advertising uses a lot

285
00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.775
of these sorts of tactics. Um, THEY take advantage

286
00:13:33.784 --> 00:13:35.445
of a lot of our strategies for how we

287
00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:39.320
process information. Um, JUST like people looking to actually

288
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:39.789
deceive us

289
00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:43.369
do. Mhm. And do you think that there are

290
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.880
perhaps some strategies, some things that we could do

291
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.340
to counter this tendency that we have to narrowly

292
00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:55.200
focus on just one piece of information?

293
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.179
Well, I mean, it depends what you mean by,

294
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.659
by counter them. Can we make it so that

295
00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:04.190
we can take in everything at once? No, I

296
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.580
mean, and, and people like to kind of think

297
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.090
so. So you might know my earlier studies with

298
00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:14.109
people passing basketballs and a person in a girl

299
00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:17.659
suit walking through a video. Um, AND people don't,

300
00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.760
about half the time people who watch that don't

301
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.169
see the gorilla. Um, AND one of the most

302
00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:25.130
common questions I get is, well, you know, what

303
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.659
can I do? So that I see the gorilla

304
00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.539
and my reaction to that is first, there's nothing

305
00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:30.780
you can do that would make it so that

306
00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:33.640
you can always see unexpected things. And second, that

307
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.200
would be a terrible thing for you. You do

308
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.969
not want that because there are limits on how

309
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:40.799
much we can pay attention to and those are

310
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.739
structural limits on how our minds work. We all

311
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.080
have that sort of limitation we can't take in

312
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.169
everything all at once. Instead, we have this remarkable

313
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:51.549
ability to focus on what we care about and

314
00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:55.460
to ignore distractions that's essential. Can you imagine trying

315
00:14:55.469 --> 00:14:58.700
to drive down the road and not be able

316
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.059
to ignore everything that's going on on the buildings

317
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.020
next to you and on the sidewalks, that's irrelevant

318
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.729
to what you're doing. You'd be perpetually distracted. You

319
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.780
couldn't focus on what you needed to do and

320
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.070
an inability to focus is harmful. That's a problem

321
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.020
for a lot of people. Um WE all have

322
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.150
the ability to focus to some extent, right? We,

323
00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:18.330
we can do that, but you can't get to

324
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.210
the point that you take in everything and notice

325
00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.349
everything because then you couldn't focus anymore. And given

326
00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:25.400
that we have limitations, we have a total amount

327
00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:29.080
of resources that we're able to use. Anything you

328
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.840
use up on stuff that you don't care about

329
00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:32.580
is stuff that you're not using for what you

330
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.400
do care about.

331
00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:38.039
Mhm. And I guess that the aspect you mentioned

332
00:15:38.049 --> 00:15:42.630
there about expectations leads us to the second habit.

333
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.750
You're exploring the book that has to do with

334
00:15:44.849 --> 00:15:47.820
prediction. So what's that about?

335
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.979
Yeah. So prediction is uh the idea that we

336
00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:55.770
tend to kind of look for the things that

337
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.020
we expect to be there and want to be

338
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.349
there. Um You can think of this as a

339
00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.489
little bit like the idea of confirmation bias. We

340
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.549
tend to look for information that's consistent with our

341
00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:07.059
beliefs as opposed to inconsistent with our beliefs. But

342
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.900
we, we frame this a little bit more broadly,

343
00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:14.299
which is that um when we are given information

344
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.419
that fits what we predict, we tend not to

345
00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:19.479
question it as much as we do when given

346
00:16:19.489 --> 00:16:23.030
information we disagree with. So if you're online and

347
00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:26.880
somebody posts something that is completely opposite to your

348
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.609
ide ideology or your politics, you're probably going to

349
00:16:30.619 --> 00:16:32.859
be highly critical of it. And we're really good

350
00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:35.559
at tearing apart things. We don't believe in. We

351
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.260
all have that sort of critical ability to rip

352
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.719
something into pieces. But if somebody happens to share

353
00:16:39.729 --> 00:16:42.750
something that you happen to agree with, you're not

354
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.659
likely to dig into it as deeply as you

355
00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:48.130
would otherwise. And if you don't dig into it,

356
00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:50.280
you might not realize that it's based on weak

357
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:55.169
evidence. So you can pass off something that's not

358
00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:58.179
true by making it consistent with what people want

359
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.849
to believe. And a huge amount of the misinformation

360
00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:04.520
we see online is targeting people with information that

361
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.358
they believe it's not, it's not trying to fool

362
00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:08.390
me into thinking something that I don't believe in

363
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.900
the first place. It's spreading it to people who

364
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.880
are likely to believe it who then spread it

365
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.250
along to other people and that makes it kind

366
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.280
of gain this sort of mass spread. Um So

367
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.089
the whole idea of that sort of viral transmission

368
00:17:21.098 --> 00:17:25.130
is not, not persuading people who disagree with you

369
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.219
because they're going to tear it to pieces. It's

370
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.790
reaching the people who would agree and not think

371
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.819
critically enough. So, the idea of the, the habit

372
00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:36.479
of prediction is that we, um we tend to

373
00:17:36.869 --> 00:17:39.359
not think as critically about. We tend to accept

374
00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:41.770
the truth of things that we expect and that

375
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.959
we predict more than things that we don't.

376
00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:47.650
And perhaps linking here to one of the first

377
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.040
points we made in our conversation when we mentioned

378
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.050
that being deceived as very little or nothing to

379
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.239
do with people being more gullible or less intelligent.

380
00:17:58.439 --> 00:18:02.300
I mean, I can't it be, can't it happen

381
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.560
that if someone is better at reasoning, they might

382
00:18:06.569 --> 00:18:10.989
even be more blinded by their own expectations?

383
00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:13.609
Yeah, there's some, there's some suggestions of that in

384
00:18:13.619 --> 00:18:17.989
the literature that people reason really well, e even

385
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.160
for simple problems known as syllogisms, where you give

386
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.359
people a logical sequence, where you, you give them

387
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:25.270
two premises and then a conclusion. If that conclusion

388
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.130
fits your beliefs, you tend not to question whether

389
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.260
it's logically sound as much as you do if

390
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.310
it, if you disagree with it. So if you

391
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:38.199
have a conclusion that gun regulations save lives, which

392
00:18:38.209 --> 00:18:39.839
is of course an issue in the United states,

393
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.890
um, not as much elsewhere in the world, fortunately,

394
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.010
uh for the rest of the world. But, um,

395
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.099
if you believe that gun regulation will save lives,

396
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.349
then a conclusion that fits that, even if it's

397
00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:54.550
not logical, even if the premises don't lead to

398
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.140
that conclusion, you're going to tend to accept it

399
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.500
as true. Whereas if you think that gun regulations

400
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.949
are bad, you'll find the logical flaws and the

401
00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:04.680
same thing. If you flip it, if you think

402
00:19:04.689 --> 00:19:07.579
if you've reached the conclusion that gun regulations are

403
00:19:07.589 --> 00:19:12.329
going to hurt safety, then if you believe that

404
00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.089
you're not going to be as critical as of

405
00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:16.150
premises that just that don't match it, right. They

406
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.709
don't actually lead to that conclusion. So, yeah, very

407
00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:24.819
smart. People can tear apart conclusions that don't follow

408
00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:27.849
if they disagree with them but are not as

409
00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:29.530
critical when it comes to things that they agree

410
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:29.810
with

411
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:35.579
and can this sort of expectation based reasoning have

412
00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:40.489
a negative impact specifically in science and the production

413
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.930
of scientific knowledge?

414
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.869
I think it's actually the biggest source of inadvertent

415
00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:50.369
scientific errors, just mistakes. Um One way to think

416
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.829
about this is imagine you're doing a study and

417
00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:55.819
you have a new experimental treatment and you want

418
00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:58.510
to test it in a randomized clinical trial. So

419
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.569
you have a treatment and you have a placebo

420
00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:02.589
and you expect the treatment to do better than

421
00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:06.310
the placebo and that's what you find in your

422
00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:10.180
results. So great. Publish it. What if you had

423
00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:12.380
found that the placebo did better than the treatment?

424
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.699
What would you do as a scientist? You go

425
00:20:14.709 --> 00:20:16.020
look at your data and see. Did I get

426
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.270
something wrong? Did I mislabel the columns? Did I

427
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.060
get them backwards? Um Were there some problematic data

428
00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:23.260
points in there, were there some participants who weren't,

429
00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:26.260
you know, assigned correctly? So you'd look for problems

430
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.449
and you look for mistakes And the key is

431
00:20:28.459 --> 00:20:31.329
that you look for mistakes more when something is

432
00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:34.050
unexpected and not what you predicted, and you're probably

433
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.829
less likely to do that when it's predicted. And

434
00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:39.050
one of the most famous examples of this sort

435
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.550
of error um came from work by uh Reinhart

436
00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:47.680
and Rogoff, who economists at Harvard, who were interested

437
00:20:47.689 --> 00:20:51.060
in pushing the idea of austerity for fiscal austerity.

438
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.119
So they analyzed uh historical data from a bunch

439
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.099
of countries and their claim from their evidence was

440
00:20:58.109 --> 00:21:01.729
that once the country's debt reached 90% of its

441
00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:05.750
GDP that their economic growth tapered off, it crashed.

442
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.400
So that was an argument that we shouldn't be

443
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.439
spending our way out of economic problems because increasing

444
00:21:12.449 --> 00:21:14.439
the debt is going to kill our economic growth.

445
00:21:14.969 --> 00:21:17.670
Um The problem was that it was at the

446
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.880
conclusion, the data were actually based on an Excel

447
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.170
spreadsheet error. They didn't fill down an equation all

448
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.900
the way down to the bottom. They, they stopped

449
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.180
after 15 countries didn't go to all 20 countries

450
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.680
and the result doesn't hold if you actually include

451
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:31.910
the rest of the countries. So it literally was

452
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.119
just an error. Um And it was an innocent

453
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.760
mistake. I don't think there was any intentionality. There,

454
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.479
there was no fudging of data, there was no,

455
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.959
you know, there, there was no scamming going on

456
00:21:40.969 --> 00:21:44.890
there, but they firmly believed this idea of austerity

457
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.910
and when the results happened to perfectly match it,

458
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.739
they ran with it. They didn't bother to check

459
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.989
it. I guarantee you that if that result had

460
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.540
come out the opposite, if they had filled down

461
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.219
and made a mistake in their Excel spreadsheet, that

462
00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:58.839
had led to the claim that austerity was terrible

463
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.260
and that you could continue spending as much as

464
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.040
you want. And there's no problem, they would have

465
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.280
really triple checked their data and found the mistake.

466
00:22:05.349 --> 00:22:08.329
So that creeps in all the time. I think

467
00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:10.680
in scientific era that people are much more likely

468
00:22:10.689 --> 00:22:14.410
to rigorously check things that don't match what they

469
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.150
predicted than there are things that perfectly match what

470
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.719
they predicted

471
00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.020
and being realistic here. And since scientists are also

472
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.510
people and like other people, they have basically the

473
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.739
same psychology. Uh Do you think that uh since

474
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:35.550
we can't expect scientists to not have any expectations

475
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.310
at all that this would be a point in

476
00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:43.030
favor of something like viewpoint diversity in science?

477
00:22:43.689 --> 00:22:45.060
I I think the first thing we should assume

478
00:22:45.069 --> 00:22:47.949
is that scientists always have opinions because we're human.

479
00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:51.469
So we always have beliefs, we always have expectations.

480
00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:56.430
We can't view things completely neutrally. Um I think

481
00:22:56.439 --> 00:23:00.469
this is an argument for implementing policies that make

482
00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.339
it harder for us to fool ourselves because the

483
00:23:03.349 --> 00:23:07.589
real danger in science is fooling ourselves. Uh Most

484
00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:09.969
scientists are not trying to fool other people, but

485
00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:11.780
they can be fooled themselves and then they spread

486
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.400
information that's wrong. Um I think there are a

487
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.959
lot of things we can do to actually hedge

488
00:23:15.969 --> 00:23:20.550
that. So one is to uh use different approaches

489
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.489
to publishing. So one is to write your analysis

490
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.430
scripts in advance of the study um before you

491
00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:28.439
have any data and test them out with pilot

492
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:31.599
data that you know, has different characteristics. So that

493
00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:33.219
when you apply to the real data, you know

494
00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:35.349
that the analysis isn't going to have an Excel

495
00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:37.670
spreadsheet error in other is to not use Excel

496
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.489
for your data analysis, but that's a different issue.

497
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.790
Um The other thing that I do in my

498
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.569
own lab now is that for every study we

499
00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:50.540
do, um Typically I am a graduate student each

500
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.900
independently code the data analysis. So we, we write

501
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.099
the analysis separately ourselves and make sure that we

502
00:23:57.109 --> 00:23:59.180
get the same results. And if we don't, normally

503
00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:01.660
it's just something, you know, a tiny coding bug,

504
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.619
but you want to catch those before you publish

505
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.770
them and that catches these sorts of mistakes. Because

506
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.790
if we're both analyzing the data, it makes it

507
00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:13.150
less likely that we're both going to make exactly

508
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.270
the same error in, in our analysis or exactly

509
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.689
the same error in our coding and you can

510
00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:20.910
find the discrepancies and figure out what's wrong with

511
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.099
them. So I think those are good things to

512
00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:26.369
do um in terms of ideological diversity. Yeah, I

513
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.750
mean, the real challenge is, of course, people aren't

514
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.089
going to believe the opposite side. There are plenty

515
00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:35.780
of examples of this in science, you know, in

516
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.500
every field of science, um there are sub fields

517
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.170
in psychology, for example, where there are two sides

518
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.109
and they don't believe what the other side has

519
00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:48.270
to say. And it doesn't really matter how strong

520
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.020
the evidence is, they won't listen to the other

521
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.479
side and that's not productive, right? We don't advance.

522
00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:56.180
Um I don't think it's necessarily a terrible thing

523
00:24:56.189 --> 00:24:58.849
for science as a whole because people outside of

524
00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:00.920
that fight who don't have a stake in, it

525
00:25:01.239 --> 00:25:03.319
can look at the evidence from the outside and

526
00:25:03.329 --> 00:25:05.969
say, ok, well, here's what they're arguing about and

527
00:25:05.979 --> 00:25:08.060
I find one side more plausible than the other.

528
00:25:08.209 --> 00:25:12.439
So people not immersed in that fight, they're going

529
00:25:12.449 --> 00:25:13.689
to be able to take a step back and

530
00:25:13.699 --> 00:25:15.800
be more objective because they don't have, they don't

531
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.780
have a horse in the race, right? So for

532
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.589
them, it's not, it's not as ideologically, you know,

533
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.930
complicated um for the debate about, you know, I,

534
00:25:26.939 --> 00:25:29.719
I think the debate about ideological diversity, I think

535
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:33.880
it's not just political diversity, it, it's having a

536
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.400
range of views so that you aren't all expecting

537
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.829
exactly the same outcome and that, that can be

538
00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:44.819
true for a really narrow, boring question. You know,

539
00:25:44.829 --> 00:25:48.160
is there memory for where you've searched items, letters

540
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.180
in a display before or after, after you've searched

541
00:25:51.189 --> 00:25:52.949
that location? Is there any reference to that you've

542
00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:55.839
been there before? That's, that's a debate within part

543
00:25:55.849 --> 00:25:59.500
of the field I'm in. There's nothing, you know,

544
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.989
deep and meaningful to anybody outside of that debate,

545
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.660
but people within it are going to hold strong

546
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.270
views. That's ok. So, I, I think there's inherently

547
00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:13.239
diversity in the sense of having different perspectives on

548
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.719
the same phenomenon, um, in science that otherwise there's

549
00:26:17.729 --> 00:26:19.489
no interest in doing a study that everybody knows

550
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.050
will come out the same way. And I have

551
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.140
this discussion in my lab all the time that

552
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.270
if a student says I often have an undergrad

553
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.150
student who will propose a project. And it's like,

554
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160
you know, wouldn't it be interesting if this were

555
00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.520
true? It's like, oh, that's, that's great. But often

556
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:39.599
they'll propose a study that's, um, like, ok, and

557
00:26:39.609 --> 00:26:42.040
I'll ask them, is there any reason anybody would

558
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.800
disagree with your prediction? And if there's not, then

559
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.140
maybe it's not as interesting to do it, it's

560
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.510
more interesting to do those studies where if it

561
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.030
comes out one way it supports one view if

562
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.209
it comes out a different way, it supports the

563
00:26:53.219 --> 00:26:55.369
other view. And both of those are interesting. That's,

564
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.770
that's the optimal kind of study.

565
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.979
And the third habit you mentioned in the book

566
00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:05.760
is commitment. So couldn't tell us first what commitments

567
00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.930
are and perhaps the differences between assumptions and commitments

568
00:27:10.939 --> 00:27:13.650
because that's also something you explore in the book.

569
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:19.050
Yeah. So a commitment is an assumption that's held

570
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.969
so firmly that we no longer are willing to

571
00:27:20.979 --> 00:27:22.339
question it and we don't think about it at

572
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:24.969
all anymore. It just becomes ingrained in how we

573
00:27:24.979 --> 00:27:28.050
act. So we all make assumptions all the time.

574
00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.369
We have to, you have to, we don't always

575
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.729
have all the information. We have to assume a

576
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:34.729
lot of things about the world and about how

577
00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:37.380
other people are acting with us. And so assumptions

578
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.540
are, are normal. What we expect commitments are when

579
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:47.469
they can sometimes become uh maladaptive. So, so often

580
00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:49.380
we want to have strong commitments to some things,

581
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.650
right? We, we, we that's not necessarily a bad

582
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.790
thing. Most of the time the problem comes when

583
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.290
you are so firmly committed to something and it

584
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.369
happens to be wrong that you don't question it.

585
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.579
So I think my favorite example of this from,

586
00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:10.589
from the book uh was um a discussion of

587
00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:12.780
a person who was a victim of Bernie Madoff's

588
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.530
Ponzi scheme. So the investment Ponzi scheme fraud biggest

589
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.630
Ponzi scheme in the modern era. Um And there

590
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.150
were a number of people who were questioning what

591
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.579
was going on with Madoff's scheme. They were suspicious

592
00:28:25.589 --> 00:28:28.280
that there was something fraudulent going on. And one

593
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.810
of them told one of his customers that had

594
00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:34.369
a customer whose parents were heavily invested in NADO.

595
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.880
And he's told this customer it's like, you know,

596
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.709
you should tell your father this isn't good. He

597
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:43.150
should be getting out of this. Um, HE shouldn't

598
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.550
be trusting this and the father's response was, well,

599
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.619
he just doesn't know Bernie. I know Bernie and

600
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.339
Bernie would never screw us. That's a commitment. It's

601
00:28:52.349 --> 00:28:54.709
so firmly beheld that there's no way that Bernie

602
00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:58.510
Madoff could possibly be somebody who would treat us

603
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.810
badly. And when you're committed to that belief, anything

604
00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:04.390
goes, you, you're not willing to take a step

605
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.910
back and say, could this be a fraud because

606
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.900
he'd never screw us? It's a, it's a firm

607
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:14.030
commitment and we see commitments going leading people astray

608
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.560
in a lot of sort of conspiracy thinking. And

609
00:29:16.569 --> 00:29:20.150
in politics where people are so firmly holding the

610
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.589
belief that this person, this politician, this person I

611
00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:25.859
like is infallible. They can do no wrong. They

612
00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:29.199
only tell the truth that you have to go

613
00:29:29.209 --> 00:29:31.290
to incredible lengths to kind of make all of

614
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.849
their inconsistent statements hold together because you've got that

615
00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:37.180
commitment that you can't back away from and it

616
00:29:37.189 --> 00:29:40.359
can lead you down this conspiratorial rabbit hole where

617
00:29:40.369 --> 00:29:41.829
you try and find all of these things to

618
00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:44.329
make everything work. It's like trying to find ways

619
00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:46.079
to make it so that all of the planets

620
00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:47.969
in the sun are orbiting the earth. Right? If

621
00:29:47.979 --> 00:29:50.130
you start with that assumption, you can find all

622
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.410
sorts of weird convoluted ways to make it seem

623
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.859
like it kind of works given the evidence at

624
00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:57.489
hand, even though it's wrong and for anybody on

625
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.000
the outside who doesn't have that commitment, it seems

626
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.000
crazy, But from the inside, it's logically coherent and

627
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.089
that, that's where you run into these problems where

628
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.390
people can't talk to each other because one has

629
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.949
a commitment that's so firm that they've gone down

630
00:30:12.959 --> 00:30:16.540
an entire path of logic, very reasonable, entire path

631
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.020
of logic starting from that commitment that they never

632
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:19.609
questioned.

633
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:25.089
But psychologically speaking, when it comes to this move

634
00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:29.890
from a simple assumption to a commitment, what is

635
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:35.140
it based on exactly? Is it trust, confidence or

636
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.530
some other thing?

637
00:30:37.109 --> 00:30:39.000
You know, that's a great question and I don't

638
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.890
have a great answer for it. It's, uh the,

639
00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:43.609
the, I think the key challenge for making sure

640
00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:46.540
that you're not being deceived is thinking about what

641
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.959
are the assumptions that you won't question. And sometimes

642
00:30:49.969 --> 00:30:53.800
those, you know, those are reasonable assumptions. Um, YOU

643
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:58.069
know, I have an assumption that people can't predict

644
00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:01.880
random events better than chance. And I think there's

645
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.489
a lot of evidence to back that assumption, but

646
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.920
it's an assumption. Um, IF I became firmly committed

647
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.829
to it, even if somebody were to come along

648
00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:12.910
and prevent present unquestionable evidence at some level, I

649
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.880
wouldn't accept it. And that's for a scientist that

650
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.459
becomes a problem when you're so committed that you

651
00:31:18.469 --> 00:31:22.040
won't look at evidence that challenges your perspective. That's

652
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.880
when it's moved into commitments rather than assumptions. And,

653
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.579
um, but what, what leads people to go that

654
00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:31.469
route? That's, it's a great question. I wish I

655
00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:33.410
had a strong answer for it.

656
00:31:33.829 --> 00:31:38.520
That's fair enough. So let's get into the final

657
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.040
habit before we talk about the four hooks you

658
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.969
want to explore in the book. So, efficiency, what,

659
00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:48.380
what does that mean in this context? Exactly. Well,

660
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.310
efficiency is just a tendency. We have to try

661
00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:54.449
and get things done in the fastest way and

662
00:31:54.459 --> 00:31:56.810
simplest way we can with the least effort, which

663
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.189
the vast majority of the time is exactly what

664
00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:01.380
we want to do. You don't want to take

665
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.609
the long way to work, you want to get

666
00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:07.290
there quickly. So, um efficiency is, is usually a

667
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.430
great thing and it just means that we sometimes

668
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.089
don't ask questions when we should. Um So when

669
00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:17.979
people are looking to deceive us, they take advantage

670
00:32:17.989 --> 00:32:20.069
of the fact that we aren't likely to ask

671
00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:23.449
more questions. We're not likely to dig deeper and

672
00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:26.660
we take glib empty answers as good enough so

673
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.849
that we can move on. And one way to

674
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:32.130
think about this is it can be really uncomfortable

675
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.109
and awkward to ask for more information. So imagine

676
00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:38.229
you're at a psychic performance and you stand up

677
00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:39.859
and say, well, you know, do you, do you

678
00:32:39.869 --> 00:32:43.930
actually know that this person had bone cancer? Um

679
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.530
You know, or, well, you started with Rob and

680
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.599
then you said Bobby, uh why did you start

681
00:32:51.609 --> 00:32:56.160
with Bobby? Those sorts of questions are awkward to

682
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.510
ask and imagine you're getting a, a business pitch.

683
00:32:59.699 --> 00:33:03.079
Um Somebody's pitching your, you and they want to

684
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.130
um they want to be a consultant for you

685
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.969
and they cite all of their, you know, success

686
00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:11.140
stories like, well, that's great. Um It's really uncomfortable

687
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.469
to ask, what are all your failure stories? How

688
00:33:14.479 --> 00:33:17.280
many other companies have you, have you uh consulted

689
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.839
for that? Didn't get these results? Um You know,

690
00:33:20.849 --> 00:33:23.400
asking those sorts of questions is exactly what we

691
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.869
need to get more information. It's, it's, you know,

692
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.560
it's recognizing when somebody is getting us to focus

693
00:33:29.569 --> 00:33:32.510
on the information they're presenting. And in that for

694
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.300
the sake of efficiency, we often don't question even

695
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:39.140
when we probably should. We take empty answers as,

696
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.739
as good enough like, oh, well, it's been validated.

697
00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:45.109
What does that mean? We're using best practices whenever

698
00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:47.540
somebody says that it often means that they can't

699
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:51.040
define what a best practice is. Um My favorite

700
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.020
of these is somebody saying, well, we're being transparent

701
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.810
whenever somebody says that they're not being transparent because

702
00:33:57.819 --> 00:34:01.239
being transparent means showing not say not telling, right?

703
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.900
Showing what you've done. So if you're being transparent,

704
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.579
like, well, how are you being transparent? What, what

705
00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:08.020
have you shown us? Um I've run into that

706
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.208
all the time. Like university administrators bragging about how

707
00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.429
transparent they're being when they haven't actually given any

708
00:34:13.438 --> 00:34:14.020
information.

709
00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:18.350
Yeah. Uh BUT don't you think, and if you

710
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.870
disagree, please tell me, but don't you think that

711
00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:24.840
there are perhaps situations cases where when it comes

712
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:30.310
to asking more questions, uh perhaps uh we are

713
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.620
simply not sure about what are, what are the

714
00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:37.620
correct questions to ask because we are not familiar

715
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:42.159
with that particular kind of subject or where someone

716
00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:46.350
might be trying to sell us, for example. And

717
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.504
in that case, I mean, it's also a lack

718
00:34:49.514 --> 00:34:54.004
of information. Uh And the fact that because we

719
00:34:54.014 --> 00:34:57.705
lack that information, we don't really know what questions

720
00:34:57.715 --> 00:34:59.415
we should ask.

721
00:34:59.425 --> 00:35:02.274
I think that's exactly right. That much of the

722
00:35:02.284 --> 00:35:04.334
time, we don't know what, what information we still

723
00:35:04.344 --> 00:35:07.435
need, we don't know what to ask. And of

724
00:35:07.445 --> 00:35:09.544
course, people are going to take advantage of that

725
00:35:09.635 --> 00:35:12.804
because people are going to be not confident about

726
00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:14.725
asking a question if they don't have some idea

727
00:35:14.735 --> 00:35:15.905
of what they want to get out of it.

728
00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:19.929
Um So that's how, that's how people will bluster

729
00:35:19.939 --> 00:35:23.340
past you and take advantage of your efficiency. It's

730
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:27.020
efficient not to ask questions. Um It's also efficient

731
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:30.229
to avoid kind of making yourself uncomfortable, right? Because

732
00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:33.620
that's just gonna take more effort and energy. Um

733
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.790
But I think there are a lot of things

734
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.439
you can do just to, to start asking questions

735
00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:40.360
that sometimes will reveal more even if you don't

736
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.570
quite know what you want. So, one good thing

737
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.149
is what else can you tell me or say

738
00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:49.560
more? And it's not a question but it gets,

739
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.110
gets whoever you're talking to, to, to talk more

740
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.679
and you know, that, that's like that standard sort

741
00:35:54.689 --> 00:35:58.189
of trope of detective movies where, you know, you've

742
00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.500
got the, got the person who you think is

743
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.780
the criminal there and you just want them to

744
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.379
talk more so they give them, give away information,

745
00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.070
same principle in cases that aren't that adversarial just

746
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.310
say, OK, can you, can you tell me a

747
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.379
little more or say more about that? Um And

748
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.810
if you do that people will talk more and

749
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.739
if they talk more, that might raise more specific

750
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.510
questions you could ask. So that's, that's a good

751
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.030
tactic to just start out. Um Another, another question

752
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.159
you can ask, that's a little more directed that

753
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.439
uh that we'll get more information is what could

754
00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:32.239
you tell me that might make me disagree with

755
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.620
you, which is, um, a way of kind of,

756
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:40.889
you know, eliciting this information that, you know, we

757
00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:43.760
really need. Um, THAT, that's the sort of question

758
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.070
that I recommend that journalists ask when they talk

759
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.340
to scientists, like who might disagree with this position.

760
00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:52.219
And why would they disagree with you? And any

761
00:36:52.229 --> 00:36:53.639
scientists should be able to answer that and say,

762
00:36:53.649 --> 00:36:55.540
ok, well, here's why somebody might disagree with my

763
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.300
position. Here's why I think they're wrong, but here's

764
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.139
why they might disagree. And that gives you an

765
00:37:00.149 --> 00:37:03.530
end to what are the commitments that they have?

766
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.239
What are their assumptions, um, who might have different

767
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.010
sets of assumptions and who could you ask about

768
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.570
them? So, the whole idea is to get people

769
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.590
to give you information that they wouldn't spontaneously give

770
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.310
you if they were trying to take advantage of

771
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.879
your willingness not to ask questions and you're willing

772
00:37:18.889 --> 00:37:20.699
just to kind of get through things efficiently.

773
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.280
Uh Also because in this particular case, I would

774
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:28.290
imagine that if you're not familiar with the whatever

775
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.639
the other person is talking about or trying to

776
00:37:30.649 --> 00:37:33.580
sell you, for example, that's also a way of

777
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.290
getting more information. And I mean, if at the

778
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.409
end of the conversation, you still do not fully

779
00:37:41.419 --> 00:37:44.489
understand what they're trying to sell you, then perhaps

780
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.320
it's just better to not

781
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.709
buy. Yeah. And I think that's often the often

782
00:37:49.719 --> 00:37:52.520
the case, right? That more often than not the

783
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.969
reason for asking questions is to get more information.

784
00:37:54.979 --> 00:37:57.110
Well, one way to get more information is to

785
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.090
ask really focused questions. If you happen to know

786
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.250
enough to ask those, the other is just to

787
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.100
get the person to talk more because when somebody

788
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.850
is trying to advertise to you. They want to

789
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.000
show you just the information they have in front

790
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.280
of them that they want to provide you. If

791
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.560
they have to talk more, if they just start

792
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.510
repeating themselves, then you know that they actually don't

793
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.379
have anything to say. But if they can provide

794
00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:20.580
more information that you might have a better understanding.

795
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.860
So, yeah, absolutely. That's, that's the whole idea is

796
00:38:22.919 --> 00:38:25.659
take a moment, even if it's just asking one

797
00:38:25.669 --> 00:38:28.070
or two more questions, when you're making an important

798
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.219
decision can get you a lot more information and

799
00:38:31.229 --> 00:38:33.459
often one question will lead to others.

800
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:39.239
Mhm And related still to efficiency. There's this concept

801
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.679
of opportunity costs. I mean, what are opportunity costs

802
00:38:42.689 --> 00:38:45.719
and why is it that sellers usually do not

803
00:38:45.729 --> 00:38:48.010
want you to consider them?

804
00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:51.830
Yeah. So I mean, opportunity costs. The simple way

805
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.929
to think about an opportunity cost is what else

806
00:38:53.939 --> 00:38:56.570
could you do with your time or money? Um

807
00:38:56.939 --> 00:39:00.860
And would you prefer that? So um somebody is

808
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.790
trying to sell you something means that they want

809
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.510
to take your money for their product, which means

810
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.239
you don't have that money available for anything else

811
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.320
for any to invest or to buy something different.

812
00:39:10.729 --> 00:39:13.250
Um So they want to focus you on the

813
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.469
benefits of their product and they don't want you

814
00:39:15.479 --> 00:39:16.820
to think about what else you could use that

815
00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.149
money for because then you might not buy the

816
00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:22.350
product. So um a lot of the goal of

817
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.060
advertising, of course, is to get you to buy

818
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.120
things without thinking about opportunities that you might have

819
00:39:27.129 --> 00:39:29.340
if you use the money for something else. Um,

820
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.699
I, I think, uh, yeah, I mean, I think

821
00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:38.790
that's the basic idea of, of opportunity costs. Um,

822
00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:41.939
ONE thing to think about for opportunity costs is

823
00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:45.290
that, you know, thinking about all of those opportunity

824
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.169
costs is inefficient. So if you have to think

825
00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:50.760
about all of the other things that you might

826
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.370
do instead that slows you down, it means that

827
00:39:53.379 --> 00:39:55.800
you're not making quick decisions, you're having to, you,

828
00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.840
you're trying to decide which of several strategies you

829
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.209
want to use for your business. That means, you

830
00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:02.429
know, thinking about what would happen if you didn't

831
00:40:02.439 --> 00:40:05.189
do any of those. Um IT takes extra time,

832
00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:10.169
it takes extra effort. So anticipating opportunity costs and

833
00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:12.370
thinking about them is inefficient in the sense that

834
00:40:12.379 --> 00:40:15.139
we don't just plow ahead and get done and

835
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.810
we have a strong drive to do that. So

836
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.090
countering that when it matters is the key. You

837
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.810
don't, you don't want to think about opportunity costs.

838
00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.810
Every time you go to the grocery store and

839
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.429
decide to buy a box of cereal, you don't

840
00:40:26.439 --> 00:40:28.290
want to stop and think what else could I

841
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.989
use this money for other than cereal? You know,

842
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.870
if I, if I need breakfast food, I could

843
00:40:32.879 --> 00:40:34.270
think about other breakfast food. But what if I

844
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.620
invested that money now? And you know how much

845
00:40:36.629 --> 00:40:37.959
value would it have to me later if I

846
00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:39.909
skipped breakfast, you don't want to go through that

847
00:40:39.919 --> 00:40:42.969
sort of thought process every time you do anything

848
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.610
you want to think about when it matters and

849
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.370
when it doesn't.

850
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:52.219
And so we've gone through the four main psychological

851
00:40:52.229 --> 00:40:55.989
habits, I guess that make us vulnerable to deception

852
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.360
getting now into the hooks that people use to

853
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.790
deceive us. So in the book, you go through

854
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:07.659
consistency, precision, potency and familiarity starting with consistency, what

855
00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:10.719
do you that is really about in this context?

856
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.830
But let me step back and say what hooks

857
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.550
hooks are. So um we think of hooks as

858
00:41:17.739 --> 00:41:21.830
information in a form that we find really attractive.

859
00:41:21.939 --> 00:41:23.580
So people who are looking to deceive us are

860
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.510
going to present information in a way that appeals

861
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.780
to us that we find more likely to be

862
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:32.479
true um that we don't think as much about.

863
00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:35.219
So again, it's one of those tactics people use

864
00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:37.540
to get us to stick with our initial assessment

865
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.280
that something is true and not to question it

866
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:43.189
as much. And all of these hooks lead us

867
00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:45.419
to sort of jump right in without thinking. So

868
00:41:45.429 --> 00:41:47.919
the metaphor I like to use for this is

869
00:41:48.199 --> 00:41:51.020
um a bull fight, a matador. And so the

870
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.860
matador stand there perfectly still with their red cape

871
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.530
and they're going to wave that cape around and

872
00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.229
the bull finds that irresistible and charges um charges

873
00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:02.649
right in without realizing that, you know, there's a

874
00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:06.969
blade behind it. Um So that, that sort of

875
00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:10.860
running in without thinking about it, um is what

876
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.159
happens when we get information that we find particularly

877
00:42:13.169 --> 00:42:15.810
appealing and it's not always just blindly running in,

878
00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.260
it's just accepting something is true when we maybe

879
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.520
shouldn't. So, um the first of those that you

880
00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.860
mentioned is consistency, which is, and, and again, just

881
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.479
like for the habits, the vast majority of time,

882
00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:31.449
these kinds of information are really good, they're really

883
00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:34.879
useful. Consistency is a perfect example of that. Usually,

884
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:38.229
if something is consistently the case, that means it's

885
00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:40.750
reliable, that means it's predictable, that means we can

886
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.100
count on it. Um And those are typically great

887
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.100
things for most of what we do in the

888
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:51.229
world, having something to be consistent is terrific. That's,

889
00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:53.979
that's what we want it to be. Um The

890
00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:57.929
problem comes in that we don't always recognize first

891
00:42:57.939 --> 00:43:01.219
when we shouldn't expect consistency. Um And don't look

892
00:43:01.229 --> 00:43:04.669
for when it should be varying. But second, when

893
00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:06.919
somebody is looking to deceive us, they use these

894
00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:10.110
hooks, they'll present these hooks without having the underlying

895
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.330
truth behind it. So somebody will present information that

896
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.860
seems really consistent because it's fabricated, not because it's

897
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.590
actually genuine and, and reliable and robust. So uh

898
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.719
in fabricated data, um this is something that happens

899
00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:29.110
in science, you know, unfortunately, more often than we

900
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.889
like, um people will, people who have committed scientific

901
00:43:33.899 --> 00:43:37.469
fraud often will present results that are consistently great.

902
00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:40.919
They get the same result every single time and

903
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.489
just as strong an effect, every single time when

904
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.320
in reality, that's not how randomness works. And it's

905
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.030
not how human behavior typically works. You don't always

906
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.790
get the same thing every single time, especially in

907
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.800
sort of a field where there's a lot of

908
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.780
randomness inherent in it. Um EVEN in physics where

909
00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.850
you're measuring something really, really precisely. Um And you

910
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.580
want to get the same results every time there's

911
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.090
still randomness in the measurement and it's not going

912
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.649
to be exactly the same to an infinite level

913
00:44:08.659 --> 00:44:11.149
of precision every single time you expect that noise.

914
00:44:11.159 --> 00:44:13.969
So if somebody gave you exactly the same thing

915
00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:16.709
to 20 decimal places, every single time, you'd worry

916
00:44:16.719 --> 00:44:18.800
about it. You should be worried about it because

917
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.250
that doesn't account for how random things are. Um

918
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.669
So somebody who's committing fraud will present that consistency

919
00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:28.159
because we like consistency. It appeals. If somebody can

920
00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:29.530
get the same results every time, it's like, wow,

921
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.669
that must be true. And the reality is that

922
00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.489
yes, if they genuinely got the same result every

923
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.149
time, that'd be great. And we use that as

924
00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:40.590
a great rule of thumb most of the time.

925
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.250
But when somebody is committing fraud, they just don't

926
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.479
have to do the data, don't have to do

927
00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:45.989
the actual studies. They can just make up consistent

928
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.729
data. And that appeals to us and we don't

929
00:44:47.739 --> 00:44:49.070
think critically enough about it.

930
00:44:50.159 --> 00:44:53.739
So it's basically that idea if it's too perfect

931
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.439
or too good to be true. So, I mean,

932
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.169
if it, if it sounds like that then prep

933
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.659
probably it's not true.

934
00:45:02.129 --> 00:45:03.889
Well, and that, that's the challenge, right? Because what

935
00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:05.679
sounds too good to be true to one person

936
00:45:05.689 --> 00:45:09.600
sounds just good enough to another. Um And so

937
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.360
it becomes really difficult to use that rule of

938
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:17.770
thumb consistently because you know, something AAA con artist

939
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.340
or a scammer who is targeting you is going

940
00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.239
to make it sound just good enough. Whereas the

941
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.229
person next door to you who hears that same

942
00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.070
pitch might say that's ridiculous. That's way too good

943
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.030
to be true, right? So it, it has to

944
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.879
be targeted appropriately. And I think targeting is what

945
00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:33.550
counts for whether you think it's too good or

946
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.689
just good enough, but they're going to present information

947
00:45:37.699 --> 00:45:41.469
that is good enough that you will accept it

948
00:45:41.479 --> 00:45:43.830
as true and they use all of these hooks.

949
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.260
But consistency is I think in science, one of

950
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.179
the most common ones um to give you data

951
00:45:49.189 --> 00:45:52.889
that just seems great. So I think one of

952
00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:55.229
the famous examples of this is Jan Hendrik Schon

953
00:45:55.429 --> 00:45:59.850
who's a, was a German uh uh in America

954
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.459
in Bell Labs, but he, he um studied uh

955
00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:07.139
superconductivity back in the early two thousands and was

956
00:46:07.149 --> 00:46:10.409
a physics superstar young guy at what was then

957
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:14.850
uh Bell labs and he published, I think 16

958
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.649
papers in the journals, Nature and Science, the top

959
00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:21.810
two science wide journals, 16 papers in two years

960
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.219
himself. And that's, that's like the output of an

961
00:46:25.229 --> 00:46:28.030
entire top notch physics department in in two years,

962
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.330
it might be higher than that. So superstar um

963
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:36.090
publishing evidence of superconductivity with different materials. And um

964
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.669
it turns out that uh if you line up

965
00:46:39.679 --> 00:46:41.889
all the papers next to each other, he was

966
00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.760
reusing the same data uh and just changing the

967
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.439
axes and changing the materials and changing the voltages

968
00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:49.600
in, in the figures. But the figures were the

969
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:54.409
same um they were likely just manufactured. It's not

970
00:46:54.419 --> 00:46:56.429
clear that there was ever any result. But that

971
00:46:56.439 --> 00:47:00.050
cost, you know, hundreds of labs, more than 100

972
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.419
labs had spent years trying to replicate his works

973
00:47:02.429 --> 00:47:04.399
and millions and millions of dollars trying to replicate

974
00:47:04.409 --> 00:47:08.310
his work. Um So it had consequence, but the,

975
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.659
the hallmark of the the misconduct there was that

976
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.449
the images were the same, the data were too

977
00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:18.169
consistent to be possible. Um And the thing I

978
00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:22.239
find most interesting about this sort of scientific misconduct

979
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.600
and scientific fraud is it's out there in the

980
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:27.909
open. It's literally in the publications, you can see

981
00:47:27.919 --> 00:47:30.169
that it's too consistent to be true, but it

982
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:33.000
gets past peer reviewers and editors and other scientists

983
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:35.560
for a variety of reasons. It seems really good,

984
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.350
it seems consistent, you know, and people don't ask

985
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.489
one more question, they process it efficiently, they read

986
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.909
it quickly and say, oh, yeah, he found this

987
00:47:41.919 --> 00:47:45.239
again and that sounds like a positive when in

988
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.919
reality it should be a red flag.

989
00:47:47.419 --> 00:47:50.810
Mhm. Yeah. And that's the thing, right. Even earlier

990
00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.840
when we talked about the scientists, that's another sort

991
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.199
of evidence that we can look into, uh, and

992
00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:01.909
make the case that scientists really are like, uh

993
00:48:01.919 --> 00:48:06.379
other people because in, uh, if it goes past

994
00:48:06.389 --> 00:48:08.620
uh peer review and all of that, I mean,

995
00:48:08.629 --> 00:48:12.000
it's not at least not usually the case that

996
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.429
people who are reviewing the studies are really incompetent.

997
00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:19.919
It's just that they are most of the time

998
00:48:19.929 --> 00:48:24.169
relying on these psychological habits.

999
00:48:24.659 --> 00:48:27.810
Yeah, I mean, and, and we can't dig into

1000
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.030
the details of every aspect of every paper and

1001
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.909
compare them to every other paper that somebody has

1002
00:48:32.919 --> 00:48:36.110
written in real time. While we're also doing our

1003
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.419
own work, people have to be efficient. Um But

1004
00:48:39.429 --> 00:48:41.379
I think this is a great example because it

1005
00:48:41.389 --> 00:48:45.649
does illustrate that we all can be fooled by,

1006
00:48:45.659 --> 00:48:47.489
by people trying to deceive us, especially if those

1007
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.709
people who are trying to deceive us are at

1008
00:48:48.719 --> 00:48:51.260
all sophisticated about it. But the people who are

1009
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:54.979
being fooled in the sciences are generally pretty smart,

1010
00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:58.909
um definitely highly trained, they're trained to be critical

1011
00:48:58.919 --> 00:49:02.870
thinkers, they're trained to evaluate evidence and they still

1012
00:49:02.879 --> 00:49:04.800
can be fooled. We all can be if it's

1013
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.459
targeting it, right. And if you look at a

1014
00:49:06.469 --> 00:49:09.120
lot of the scientific fraud that's out there more

1015
00:49:09.129 --> 00:49:12.780
often than not. It's not earth shattering or groundbreaking

1016
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.409
work more often than not. It is kind of

1017
00:49:16.419 --> 00:49:19.459
what we would predict in, in a field or

1018
00:49:19.469 --> 00:49:20.620
at least kind of what a lot of people

1019
00:49:20.629 --> 00:49:23.370
in that field would predict and expect. Um It's

1020
00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:25.909
often a little bit more impressive in some way.

1021
00:49:25.919 --> 00:49:29.270
So it's methodologically heroic. It took a huge amount

1022
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.320
of effort to do or it used a group

1023
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.260
of uh participants or subjects or, you know, a

1024
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.030
population or animals that are hard to access. Um

1025
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:42.110
So that makes it more impressive, right? It, it

1026
00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.520
usually is slightly cleaner, uh slightly better than what

1027
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.739
other people have found. Um So the result is

1028
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.659
that it kind of fits right in with other

1029
00:49:51.669 --> 00:49:54.469
sorts of studies that have been published, but improves

1030
00:49:54.479 --> 00:49:55.969
on them a little bit. So it makes that

1031
00:49:55.979 --> 00:49:58.139
person seem like they're just that much better than

1032
00:49:58.149 --> 00:50:00.729
the other people around them but not doing something

1033
00:50:00.739 --> 00:50:04.040
so extraordinary that people immediately doubt it. So a

1034
00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:09.580
contrast example for this is um in, you know,

1035
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.810
some years ago, a famous paper published in the

1036
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.729
top journal in social psychology claimed to find evidence

1037
00:50:16.739 --> 00:50:19.250
that people could predict random events better than chance,

1038
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.949
right? So essentially a form of psychic ability and

1039
00:50:22.959 --> 00:50:26.010
the immediate reaction to that was no, that's not

1040
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.080
right. It can't be right. Um So the question

1041
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.979
then is what's wrong with it. Um, BUT that

1042
00:50:31.989 --> 00:50:34.169
was because it didn't fit into what people already

1043
00:50:34.179 --> 00:50:36.139
believed and it wasn't fraudulent. I think he just,

1044
00:50:36.149 --> 00:50:39.800
it was somebody fooling themselves, um, you know, with

1045
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.830
their analysis and there were lots of issues with

1046
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.050
how they did their analysis. But, um, it wasn't

1047
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.610
fraud and that would have been a dumb study

1048
00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.820
to make up right, as a fraud because people

1049
00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.649
would immediately discount it and start digging into it

1050
00:50:51.659 --> 00:50:54.070
and looking into the problems with it. So the

1051
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.739
things that kind of survive as frauds for a

1052
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.659
while before they get caught are typically not outlandish

1053
00:50:59.669 --> 00:51:03.919
claims. They are typically landish just, you know, slightly

1054
00:51:04.169 --> 00:51:06.860
slightly, you know, slightly impressive. They, they land in

1055
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:07.580
the right spot.

1056
00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.949
They are physically credible enough,

1057
00:51:11.649 --> 00:51:14.909
credible enough, right? They, they, they're still impressive, but

1058
00:51:14.919 --> 00:51:18.939
they're credible enough and credible enough within the realm

1059
00:51:18.949 --> 00:51:20.500
of other things that have been published in that

1060
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:24.219
area. And that, that's kind of the typical finding.

1061
00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:27.679
So I think a great example of science working

1062
00:51:27.689 --> 00:51:31.300
correctly and not necessarily involving fraud is, you know,

1063
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:35.370
claims of room temperature fusion which have come and

1064
00:51:35.379 --> 00:51:38.719
gone repeatedly over the years in physics. Um, THERE

1065
00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:42.310
have been cases of fraud in, in that world,

1066
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.540
but more often than not, it's just somebody who's,

1067
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.219
there was something odd about the materials they're working

1068
00:51:48.229 --> 00:51:49.969
with and they didn't figure out what it was

1069
00:51:49.979 --> 00:51:51.889
and it sounded good. So they went with the

1070
00:51:51.899 --> 00:51:55.159
claim that it was, you know, called fusion and

1071
00:51:55.169 --> 00:51:57.209
then physicists immediately dug into it because that's a

1072
00:51:57.219 --> 00:52:00.610
big claim. Right? And big claims require very strong

1073
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.330
evidence and people will dig into them more. Um,

1074
00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:08.350
THAT'S, you know, that's part of why those sorts

1075
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.000
of claims garner so much attention is that they

1076
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.709
are out there, they are a little too far

1077
00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.199
and that's if, and they're one of those, if

1078
00:52:16.209 --> 00:52:18.500
true, that would be amazing sorts of findings. And

1079
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.350
anytime you hear, like, if that's true, that would

1080
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.969
be amazing. You should be skeptical about it because,

1081
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.199
you know, amazing breakthroughs are pretty rare.

1082
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.750
Right? So, getting into the second hook, familiarity, I

1083
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.889
think that we've already mentioned this briefly earlier in

1084
00:52:34.899 --> 00:52:39.750
our conversation. But what does familiarity indicate to us?

1085
00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:43.629
Exactly. So, usually familiarity is a great cue to

1086
00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:48.149
something being trustworthy. So, imagine, you know, your friends,

1087
00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:51.639
your family, people, you know, personally, um, if you've

1088
00:52:51.649 --> 00:52:53.270
been around them for a long time, you know,

1089
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.840
whether or not you can trust them and you

1090
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.500
know, how much to trust what they say and

1091
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.260
how much to discount it. Right. We all have

1092
00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:00.969
that relative. We don't trust what they say. But

1093
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.060
for the most part, if you're around people a

1094
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:08.760
lot that familiarity makes it reasonable to continue to

1095
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.899
trust, to accept the truth of what they're saying

1096
00:53:10.909 --> 00:53:14.489
without questioning it as much, it makes the truth

1097
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:19.310
bias reasonable. Um, AND that's, that's a great cue

1098
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.370
for, for us most of the time. Um, IT

1099
00:53:22.379 --> 00:53:25.110
becomes a problem in terms of deception because we

1100
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.719
mistake superficial familiarity with genuine familiarity. So we see

1101
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:32.110
a celebrity a lot, we hear a lot of

1102
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.750
interviews with them. We kind of feel like we

1103
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.590
know them and because we kind of feel like

1104
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.439
we know them, we tend not to be as

1105
00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:41.540
critical when they say something, you know, as we

1106
00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:47.030
should. Um, ROMANCE scams, um which are a major

1107
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.290
source of scams, financial scams and other sorts of

1108
00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.149
scams right now, often targeting older folks who are,

1109
00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:57.590
are lonely, um, divorcees or widowers or widows. Um

1110
00:53:58.479 --> 00:54:01.399
AND they, the way they work, it's almost entirely

1111
00:54:01.409 --> 00:54:07.270
online and they establish over time familiarity. They feel

1112
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.860
you feel like you're getting to know this person

1113
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.489
who you're interacting with a lot online, but you've

1114
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.969
never actually met them in person and they probably

1115
00:54:14.979 --> 00:54:16.699
look nothing like what they tell you they do.

1116
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:20.429
Um And that's those scams are really effective because

1117
00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:24.070
we confuse the sort of familiarity we sort of

1118
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.489
evolved with interacting with people directly having close associates

1119
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.639
that we know really well. Um And can distinguish

1120
00:54:31.649 --> 00:54:34.199
from people we don't know very well. We confuse

1121
00:54:34.209 --> 00:54:36.840
that with, you know, friends on Facebook who you

1122
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:39.229
might never have met in person or you encounter

1123
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:42.300
only on social media and people can present a

1124
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:45.780
persona um very easily. So somebody looking to deceive

1125
00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.370
you is going to take advantage of that present

1126
00:54:48.379 --> 00:54:52.169
themselves like they like a friend would and take

1127
00:54:52.179 --> 00:54:54.889
advantage of that experience of familiarity.

1128
00:54:56.739 --> 00:55:01.060
And what about uh precision? So what does it

1129
00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:05.969
mean to be precise here? And uh but basically,

1130
00:55:05.979 --> 00:55:11.919
how do, how can we distinguish reliable information from

1131
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:17.129
detailed concrete information? That is just BS,

1132
00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.120
that's the real challenge, right? And that's why these

1133
00:55:20.129 --> 00:55:24.820
hooks can fool us so easily. Um So usually

1134
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:27.689
if somebody can give you a precise answer and

1135
00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:31.080
it's grounded, it's based on real evidence. That's great.

1136
00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.510
That's really impressive. So that physicist who can measure

1137
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.739
some constant to six decimal places, that's great. They

1138
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.909
can do it reliably, they can give you the

1139
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:43.800
exact number more or less. Um And that precision

1140
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.510
means that they have great understanding. Um A weather

1141
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.090
forecaster who can say that it's going rain will

1142
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.250
cover 25% of this region uh between two and

1143
00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.209
four tomorrow. That's a great prediction that's precise. Um

1144
00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.709
And to the extent that they are calibrated and

1145
00:55:59.719 --> 00:56:01.889
do it well, that means they have a good

1146
00:56:01.899 --> 00:56:05.320
understanding of the weather pattern for that day. Um

1147
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:07.810
Much better. It's much more informative than saying it

1148
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.879
might or might not rain sometime in the next

1149
00:56:09.889 --> 00:56:13.810
three days. But that doesn't, that doesn't have any

1150
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.800
value to us. So we value precision because precision

1151
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:20.949
usually is a sign of great understanding. The problem

1152
00:56:20.959 --> 00:56:22.840
of course, is anybody looking to deceive us can

1153
00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:25.419
just fake precision. They'll give us numbers and those

1154
00:56:25.429 --> 00:56:28.209
numbers don't necessarily have any meaning to them. That's

1155
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:31.550
where we run into problems that um it's very

1156
00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.260
easy to give a precise number and make it

1157
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.689
seem like it's something genuine when there's no actual

1158
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:39.659
evidence backing it.

1159
00:56:41.149 --> 00:56:45.040
Mhm. Uh And when, when, when it comes to

1160
00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:49.169
potency, there is the last hook. What is it

1161
00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:50.090
really about?

1162
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:54.340
So, potency is, are you almost like, you know,

1163
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:58.850
the desire for big fixes, quick fixes that one,

1164
00:56:59.409 --> 00:57:02.659
you know, this one simple trick will fix your

1165
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.500
problem. And there's a reason why that Clickbait works

1166
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.719
well on, on social media. We all want the

1167
00:57:08.729 --> 00:57:12.010
sort of quick fix the easy solution, the, you

1168
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.899
know, become a master at something in just a

1169
00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:17.629
few hours. Um That sort of ability to radically

1170
00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:21.239
change things with the minimal effort. So big effects

1171
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:26.570
from small, small effort, a small intervention, there are

1172
00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.969
rare cases where that holds true where a tiny

1173
00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:33.520
little thing can have a gigantic effect. The discovery

1174
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:38.219
of antibiotics, vaccines, huge consequences from a tiny little

1175
00:57:38.229 --> 00:57:42.550
thing, right? That's um those are, you know, those

1176
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.169
are rare and few and far between. But we

1177
00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:49.560
have this tendency to kind of assume that things

1178
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:52.540
should be easier than they are that we can

1179
00:57:52.909 --> 00:57:55.600
stave off the effects of cognitive aging by playing

1180
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:58.149
a brain game for 10 hours like nope, not

1181
00:57:58.159 --> 00:58:02.469
gonna work. Um But that, that potency, that desire

1182
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:06.030
for potent effects genuinely is a good thing when

1183
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.590
it's true. It's just that we see it far

1184
00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.000
more often than we think we do. And people

1185
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.550
who are looking to deceive us always take advantage

1186
00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.060
of that one, right, that they can, who are

1187
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:17.719
trying to sell us some sort of fake product

1188
00:58:17.729 --> 00:58:20.969
will always claim giant benefits from something that really

1189
00:58:20.979 --> 00:58:26.209
doesn't have giant benefits. Um As a general rule,

1190
00:58:26.219 --> 00:58:31.250
big consequences require big interventions. You, you don't get,

1191
00:58:31.739 --> 00:58:33.320
you don't get a big outcome from a small

1192
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:33.649
thing.

1193
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.370
Mhm A and again and again, I imagine that

1194
00:58:37.379 --> 00:58:40.379
here, as we said, it has nothing to do

1195
00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:43.360
or very little to do with cognitive ability, but

1196
00:58:43.449 --> 00:58:47.709
with lack of information. Because if, for example, you

1197
00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:52.030
are a scientist of a particular area and you

1198
00:58:52.379 --> 00:58:57.139
uh are advertised something uh that promises to get

1199
00:58:57.149 --> 00:59:01.149
huge benefits from very small investment or from a

1200
00:59:01.159 --> 00:59:04.729
very small thing. And you are sort of familiar

1201
00:59:04.739 --> 00:59:07.500
with what they're talking about. They would, you would

1202
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:10.409
say immediately, oh this is just BS come on.

1203
00:59:10.899 --> 00:59:14.476
It's much more complicated than that. But people who

1204
00:59:14.486 --> 00:59:18.166
just lack that sort of knowledge are much more

1205
00:59:18.176 --> 00:59:22.375
vulnerable to that kind of advertisement, for example.

1206
00:59:22.706 --> 00:59:24.845
And even even scientists fall for this sort of

1207
00:59:24.855 --> 00:59:27.186
stuff all the time, right? There is, there is

1208
00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:31.085
an entire field of um what sometimes is called

1209
00:59:31.095 --> 00:59:33.795
social priming where you, you kind of flash some

1210
00:59:33.805 --> 00:59:36.612
words briefly or have people these scramble sentences. And

1211
00:59:36.791 --> 00:59:39.412
the claim was doing that sort of trivial task

1212
00:59:39.422 --> 00:59:42.352
would have these big effects on behavior, right? That

1213
00:59:42.362 --> 00:59:44.241
would actually change what you do. And it was

1214
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.562
sort of a cottage industry and social psychology to

1215
00:59:46.572 --> 00:59:49.142
generate these effects that were more and more kind

1216
00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:52.741
of outlandish, like, you know, scrambling and unscrambling sentences

1217
00:59:52.751 --> 00:59:56.251
related to being old makes you walk more slowly.

1218
00:59:57.291 --> 01:00:00.372
It just doesn't none of those hold up. Um

1219
01:00:00.572 --> 01:00:03.092
But there are tons and tons of papers in

1220
01:00:03.102 --> 01:00:07.530
the literature on this Um big interventions designed to

1221
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.969
remedy really complex social problems. Um Things like uh

1222
01:00:11.979 --> 01:00:15.429
there, there are a whole series of studies recently

1223
01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:19.080
that are called sometimes called wise interventions and they're

1224
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:22.399
called wise interventions. The idea is that they don't

1225
01:00:22.409 --> 01:00:26.070
require much effort and they are highly efficient and

1226
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.350
lead to these big outcomes. So their claims that

1227
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.699
like doing a one hour affirmation in a school

1228
01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:35.870
at the beginning of school, uh reduces disparities in

1229
01:00:35.879 --> 01:00:39.899
suspensions for black and white kids um or increases

1230
01:00:39.909 --> 01:00:43.010
academic achievement two years later, like, you know, these

1231
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.909
are really complex multiply determined problems in society, right?

1232
01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:51.080
The suspension gap has there's so many factors that

1233
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:54.550
contribute to that suspension gap and it's not just

1234
01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.399
something that's going to go away with a one

1235
01:00:56.409 --> 01:01:02.510
hour, you know, thinking about yourself intervention. Um BUT

1236
01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:05.840
these things are pervasive in the schools, um growth

1237
01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.860
mindset interventions, you probably have heard of growth mindset.

1238
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.540
Um Yeah. So there are claims that, you know,

1239
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.500
one hour affirmation, you know, one hour growth mindset,

1240
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:18.030
intervention is going to change your academic performance sometime

1241
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.510
later. Like no, you know, that you, you'd be

1242
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.399
hard pressed to find a school district in the

1243
01:01:23.409 --> 01:01:26.189
United States, at least that doesn't apply growth mindset

1244
01:01:26.199 --> 01:01:29.120
in some way. And it's a big industry now.

1245
01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:32.949
Um If you look, there's a recent meta analysis

1246
01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:35.510
of all of these interventions and most of them

1247
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.379
had severe method problems, most of them didn't actually

1248
01:01:38.389 --> 01:01:41.729
even measure whether the intervention changed people's mindsets. Um

1249
01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.479
And if you look at the handful of them

1250
01:01:44.489 --> 01:01:47.889
that did it, well, there's basically no effect of

1251
01:01:47.899 --> 01:01:52.010
these interventions on academic performance or outcomes. So it's

1252
01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.080
one of these things where it's, you know, a

1253
01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:58.000
tiny little intervention to address something that's a big

1254
01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:03.000
societal complex problem. And people find those really appealing

1255
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.030
and aren't sufficiently critical of them when they, when

1256
01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.310
they are made because as scientists, we should be

1257
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.669
always skeptical of big effects from small interventions, but

1258
01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:14.770
they appeal a lot when they're true. And if

1259
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.459
it were true, it would be amazing, right? If,

1260
01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:17.870
if it were true that you could just spend

1261
01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:20.090
an hour and fix a major problem, that would

1262
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.409
be great. Just we tend to find it more

1263
01:02:23.419 --> 01:02:24.290
appealing than we should.

1264
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.689
Yeah. And I mean, I guess that generally speaking,

1265
01:02:27.699 --> 01:02:32.419
if we're talking about the multifactorial issue, if someone

1266
01:02:32.429 --> 01:02:36.489
claims that just targeting one single factor will solve

1267
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.810
it, uh it's probably not going to happen.

1268
01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:42.620
Yeah. And there's there's a sort of, you know,

1269
01:02:42.629 --> 01:02:46.360
desire to find the single, the single solution, the

1270
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.939
single cause, um fixing one thing to fix all

1271
01:02:49.949 --> 01:02:53.939
the things. And, you know, often that's not a

1272
01:02:53.949 --> 01:02:57.280
terrible approach to, to look for, to try and

1273
01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.280
find that single cause. This is a common practice

1274
01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:00.739
in medicine, right? If you have somebody who's got

1275
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.239
a bunch of symptoms, you want to look to

1276
01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.330
see is there one thing that's causing all the

1277
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.239
symptoms? Um, AND often there is, and that's, that's

1278
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:13.989
the simplest possible explanation for what's going on. Uh,

1279
01:03:14.389 --> 01:03:19.149
IN these cases, it's more commonly, there's one issue

1280
01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:21.360
that we want to address. There's basically one symptom,

1281
01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:27.070
say racial disparities in suspensions or, um, and we

1282
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.550
have that one issue but it's caused by many,

1283
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.149
many things and those are cases where fixing one

1284
01:03:33.159 --> 01:03:35.330
of those many, many things isn't going to likely

1285
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.280
have a complete effect on the outcome. It's, it

1286
01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:41.239
works great when you've got one cause for many

1287
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.290
symptoms. It doesn't work so great when there's many

1288
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.600
causes for one symptom.

1289
01:03:45.879 --> 01:03:49.010
Right. So, I have two or three more questions

1290
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.370
before we wrap up the interview about the hooks.

1291
01:03:52.379 --> 01:03:56.939
Is it that the best deceivers out there resort

1292
01:03:56.949 --> 01:04:01.189
always to all four Hooks or can they just

1293
01:04:01.199 --> 01:04:03.879
resort to one or two of them or does

1294
01:04:03.889 --> 01:04:04.760
it work? Exactly.

1295
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.280
I, I think it, it varies a lot. Um,

1296
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.600
BASED on what's necessary to pull somebody in and

1297
01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:11.800
what the, what the scope of a deception is

1298
01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:14.830
for something that's just sort of AAA, very limited,

1299
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.429
you know, limited sort of fooling somebody just, you

1300
01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:20.719
know, quick encounter where they're just trying to pass

1301
01:04:20.729 --> 01:04:23.189
off some product they might not use more than

1302
01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:25.899
one or two of these. Um, SOMETHING that's a

1303
01:04:25.909 --> 01:04:30.080
long running scam, um, likely has to adopt a

1304
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:33.780
lot more of them. So take, uh Bernie Madoff's

1305
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.939
Ponzi scheme, I think that's a good example of

1306
01:04:35.949 --> 01:04:39.709
one, you know, ran for 15 plus years um

1307
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:42.419
where he didn't process a single transaction, they were

1308
01:04:42.429 --> 01:04:47.489
all faked for for that longer duration. And so

1309
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.620
he, you know, he, he used focus to some

1310
01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:52.830
extent because he's going to give you the information,

1311
01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.399
you want your returns but not tell you all

1312
01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:57.330
of the details about how he managed to do

1313
01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.780
that. You know the missing information. He's counting on

1314
01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.850
you not asking how is it that you managed

1315
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.060
to get identical returns month to month, year to

1316
01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:07.959
year because nobody else can. Um So most people

1317
01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:10.320
don't ask that most people don't ask for more

1318
01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:14.550
information than he provides. And he, he um he

1319
01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.580
set people up to expect the same returns every

1320
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:20.459
year. They would get their 8 to 14% every

1321
01:05:20.469 --> 01:05:23.590
year, not having any down years. And as long

1322
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.290
as they kept getting what they expected, people didn't

1323
01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.239
complain, they didn't question it. If they had a

1324
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.699
big down year, he would have, they would have

1325
01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:31.590
questioned it, but he gave them what they expected.

1326
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.439
He counted on commitments as we already discussed that

1327
01:05:34.449 --> 01:05:37.959
people trusted him and they didn't think he would

1328
01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:39.610
be ever the sort of person who would screw

1329
01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.979
them over. He was also familiar to many of

1330
01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:46.040
the people who invested with him. He uh specifically

1331
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.689
targeted members of his social community in New York,

1332
01:05:48.699 --> 01:05:52.169
e especially um he selected the people who could

1333
01:05:52.179 --> 01:05:54.639
invest with him. Um He didn't just let anybody

1334
01:05:54.649 --> 01:05:57.270
invest with him, he would turn people away. Um

1335
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.250
So he selected the people who he was, he

1336
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.719
was in, who are investing with him. Um He

1337
01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:06.169
used precision. So he would give people this huge

1338
01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:09.030
print out of every of records of trades that

1339
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.929
were all fabricated um in their, you know, in

1340
01:06:12.939 --> 01:06:15.409
their reports, it wasn't online like it would be

1341
01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:17.459
for most major investors. It was just all of

1342
01:06:17.469 --> 01:06:20.669
these trade transaction forms. So lots of detail there

1343
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.750
that just didn't have anything backing it. It was,

1344
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.429
it was a perfect example of, you know, giving

1345
01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:29.560
precise information without any substance to it. Um Potency,

1346
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.060
maybe he didn't use a whole lot because we

1347
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:35.100
think of potency as the classic Ponzi scheme where

1348
01:06:35.989 --> 01:06:38.929
invest now and you're guaranteed 50% returns in six

1349
01:06:38.939 --> 01:06:41.679
months. He never did that. In fact, he kind

1350
01:06:41.689 --> 01:06:43.689
of performed about the same as the S and

1351
01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.340
P 500 the major stock index over the course

1352
01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:49.610
of his Ponzi scheme. His investment wasn't that outstanding?

1353
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.080
It was just stable. It was, you never had

1354
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:56.330
a down year with Bernie. Um So he used

1355
01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.669
consistency a lot more than he used potency. But

1356
01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:01.090
yeah, I mean, he, he used a lot of

1357
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.060
these techniques and how he went about it,

1358
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:07.389
which in a way perhaps made it even more

1359
01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:08.199
grabbable.

1360
01:07:08.929 --> 01:07:10.840
Yeah. Well, in order to keep it, keep it

1361
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.350
going that long, he would have to tap into

1362
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.000
a lot of the sort of ways of thinking

1363
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:17.280
that keep people from questioning the truth of what

1364
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:21.679
he's saying. So, yeah, that's, that's, that's right. The

1365
01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:23.870
longer something goes, the more complex it is, the

1366
01:07:23.879 --> 01:07:26.439
more they're going to have to rely on deceiving

1367
01:07:26.449 --> 01:07:27.570
you in different ways.

1368
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:31.899
Uh And another question I have here is so

1369
01:07:31.909 --> 01:07:35.169
we've already mentioned several times how this has very

1370
01:07:35.179 --> 01:07:38.820
little or nothing to do with people's cognitive ability

1371
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.540
or any other kind of psychological threats. But isn't

1372
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:47.100
it the case that many times scammers or receivers

1373
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:52.429
target specific vulnerable people? Of course, to do that,

1374
01:07:52.439 --> 01:07:56.219
they have to have specific kinds of information about

1375
01:07:56.229 --> 01:07:59.760
specific people. I mean, some, sometimes they target just

1376
01:07:59.889 --> 01:08:04.090
the elderly in general, sometimes they might target very

1377
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.500
specific niches of people. Like for example, if it's

1378
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:10.879
a romantic scam, they might target people that they

1379
01:08:10.889 --> 01:08:13.290
know are single and do not like to be

1380
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.929
single or something like that. But I, I mean,

1381
01:08:15.939 --> 01:08:19.669
it's also the case that uh the, some of

1382
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.870
the most successful scammers are also the ones that

1383
01:08:24.879 --> 01:08:27.310
know who to target.

1384
01:08:28.209 --> 01:08:30.600
So there are two different approaches, right? And there

1385
01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.160
undoubtedly are some people who are more gullible than

1386
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:35.890
others. There are going to be individual differences there.

1387
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.700
I don't think that's the defining factor in whether

1388
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:40.069
or not somebody can be scammed. So I think

1389
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.700
the danger is in assuming that because you're a

1390
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:46.099
smart critical thinker that you can't be, can't be

1391
01:08:46.108 --> 01:08:52.390
deceived. Um That's undoubtedly wrong. Uh The, the idea

1392
01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:53.870
that some people are more likely to be seed

1393
01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:58.330
than others is certainly true and some people are

1394
01:08:58.339 --> 01:09:00.640
more easy to target than others. But there are

1395
01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:03.490
two different approaches that scammers can take. One is

1396
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:07.089
uh to specifically learn a lot about a person

1397
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:11.149
and meet them where they are. So, yeah, if

1398
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.080
you're a romance scammer, you're not going to target

1399
01:09:14.089 --> 01:09:17.328
somebody who's happily married. That's just not going to

1400
01:09:17.337 --> 01:09:20.508
be an effective target. If you are using the

1401
01:09:20.519 --> 01:09:23.988
calling card scam, which is a standard tactic or

1402
01:09:23.999 --> 01:09:26.667
the call center scam where people will call up

1403
01:09:26.679 --> 01:09:31.538
people targeting them for a particular uh fear. So

1404
01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:35.008
often in the scams are often based out of

1405
01:09:35.019 --> 01:09:37.288
other countries. And then we'll call in to say

1406
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.568
the United States and we will target people who

1407
01:09:39.578 --> 01:09:42.969
are here on a limited visa status or, or

1408
01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:46.100
here illegally and we threaten them with deportation or

1409
01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:49.540
with arrest unless they pay up right away. That

1410
01:09:49.549 --> 01:09:51.890
scam is not going to work on me. It's

1411
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.129
no work on somebody who is an immigrant. Um

1412
01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.529
And there are variants of it that will work.

1413
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.370
There are variants of that, that work on professors,

1414
01:09:58.379 --> 01:10:00.270
right? There's a, there's a variant of this right

1415
01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:03.540
now, which is really clever. So if you are

1416
01:10:03.549 --> 01:10:06.890
a professor who gives invited talks at conferences, um

1417
01:10:06.899 --> 01:10:11.859
on occasion, uh quite often the conference organizers will

1418
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.069
arrange your hotel and some of your travel for

1419
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.959
you. So um there's a con right now that's

1420
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:22.350
working pretty effectively um where the con artist will

1421
01:10:22.359 --> 01:10:25.490
look at the conferences, figure out who's invited to

1422
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.080
speak. And we call those people and pretend to

1423
01:10:28.089 --> 01:10:31.399
be the conference organizers to arrange their travel and

1424
01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:34.830
they'll arrange their hotel and flight information, which means

1425
01:10:34.839 --> 01:10:36.660
they get all of their personal information and their

1426
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:39.060
credit card and they have nothing to do with

1427
01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:40.750
the conference. They just looked up the information and

1428
01:10:40.759 --> 01:10:44.549
targeted. So again, professors can fall for this and

1429
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.950
have. Um So that's one approach is the specific

1430
01:10:48.959 --> 01:10:52.149
targeting. The other approach is to allow the victims

1431
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.830
to select themselves. Um So I don't know if

1432
01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:59.330
you have this particular scam in, in Portugal, but

1433
01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.299
uh where you get an automated call asking you

1434
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.680
about extending your cars warranty. Do you guys have

1435
01:11:04.689 --> 01:11:05.560
that one? I

1436
01:11:05.569 --> 01:11:10.279
got that not about a car warranty about other

1437
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.250
things, but yeah, I, I got, I got that

1438
01:11:13.259 --> 01:11:13.490
kind

1439
01:11:13.549 --> 01:11:16.069
of thing. So these are these robocalls. It's like

1440
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.450
most people like, yeah, those are scam. Um But

1441
01:11:20.899 --> 01:11:23.439
the people who call it back have just identified

1442
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:27.140
themselves as somebody who is a target. It's somebody

1443
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.799
who is concerned about their car's warranty. So they,

1444
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:33.180
they self identified. So the scammers there don't have

1445
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:35.819
to waste any time selecting people. All they have

1446
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:37.140
to do is just blast it out to as

1447
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:39.200
many people as possible. And then some people will

1448
01:11:39.209 --> 01:11:42.799
respond same thing with the original Nigerian prints email

1449
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.299
scam, which has been going on for decades now.

1450
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:48.740
It, it was, it existed before email. Um AS,

1451
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.959
as letters. Um But the idea of that scam

1452
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:55.709
is they can send out now millions of those

1453
01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.830
emails, most of which look ridiculous, right? Most people

1454
01:11:59.839 --> 01:12:02.439
are not going to fall for that. Um There's

1455
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:04.700
bad grammar. It's weird, you know, I still get

1456
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:07.560
these in my inbox, um mostly caught by the

1457
01:12:07.569 --> 01:12:11.000
spam filters now. But um, but if you think

1458
01:12:11.009 --> 01:12:13.830
about it, they're not trying to reach you or

1459
01:12:13.839 --> 01:12:17.330
me. They're trying to reach those very small number

1460
01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:19.250
of people who have not heard of this scam

1461
01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:22.859
and who will respond to that email. So they

1462
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.839
want to make it as obvious as possible so

1463
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:27.279
that they don't have to waste any time with

1464
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:29.560
people who aren't going to eventually pay up. They

1465
01:12:29.569 --> 01:12:31.439
want only the most gullible, they want the person

1466
01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:34.410
who calls back about their car's warranty. So anybody

1467
01:12:34.419 --> 01:12:37.520
who responds to that email is a likely target

1468
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.890
and it's cost efficient for them because they don't

1469
01:12:39.899 --> 01:12:41.509
have to waste time with all of the people

1470
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.379
who are more skeptical of that particular email. So,

1471
01:12:45.459 --> 01:12:48.560
yeah, they scams are targeted in, in different sorts

1472
01:12:48.569 --> 01:12:51.680
of ways either by selecting and really getting to

1473
01:12:51.689 --> 01:12:54.479
know the people you're, they're trying to victimize or

1474
01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:56.390
by allowing people to select themselves.

1475
01:12:57.939 --> 01:13:01.600
So, my last question, then I guess that we

1476
01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:06.490
can say here that there's no foolproof way of

1477
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.879
being able to always identify the scammers and the

1478
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:14.350
deceivers. But I guess that the point of your

1479
01:13:14.359 --> 01:13:18.399
book here is for people to be more aware

1480
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:20.984
of the fact that we have this sort of

1481
01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:25.265
psychological habits, this truth bias and to perhaps in

1482
01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:32.365
specific situations, be more aware and wary of certain

1483
01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.654
things that people say and, and perhaps ask more

1484
01:13:35.665 --> 01:13:39.515
questions in specific situations as well and stuff like

1485
01:13:39.524 --> 01:13:44.200
that. Uh Because most of the time our proof

1486
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:47.520
bias still works. Most

1487
01:13:47.529 --> 01:13:49.189
of the time, all of these things still work.

1488
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.520
Um Most of the time, none of us are

1489
01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:55.049
very few of us are going to be victims

1490
01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.799
of a grand con, right? Most of us are

1491
01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:00.750
not going to succumb to that. We'll, we'll all

1492
01:14:00.759 --> 01:14:03.759
be fooled by misinformation at times. We'll all be

1493
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.490
fooled by deception and every now and then we'll

1494
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.560
get taken for some money by somebody who's trying

1495
01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:10.049
to rip us off. But most of us are

1496
01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.160
not going to be a victim of a grand

1497
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:17.109
scam of the Madoff variety. Um, FORTUNATELY, um, but

1498
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.799
I think, I think your first point is exactly

1499
01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:20.759
right that, you know, you'd like to think. Oh,

1500
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:23.100
is there a quick, quick fix an easy solution

1501
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.500
to not ever being scammed? And that would, that

1502
01:14:26.509 --> 01:14:29.390
would be tapping into the hook of potency if

1503
01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.029
I promised you that if I, if I said

1504
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.979
here's all you have to do to avoid ever

1505
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:36.450
being scammed, there is no such thing and we

1506
01:14:36.459 --> 01:14:40.160
should know that after reading about the potency that

1507
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.839
there's no one quick fix for a really complex

1508
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:46.649
multifaceted problem. Um But I do think there's an

1509
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.629
advantage in learning about these hooks. Um It's a

1510
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.669
lifelong process to think about when you need to

1511
01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.689
be skeptical and when you shouldn't. But all of

1512
01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.870
these hooks and habits are things that underlie almost

1513
01:14:58.879 --> 01:15:02.390
all forms of deception so far known and likely

1514
01:15:02.399 --> 01:15:06.069
to exist in the future. And as you start

1515
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.600
kind of recognizing the patterns, you might start recognizing

1516
01:15:09.609 --> 01:15:11.319
when they're at play in times when you're at

1517
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:14.500
risk. So, um one of the strategies that I

1518
01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:17.509
think is probably helpful is next time you're listening

1519
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.069
to a story about a con or reading an

1520
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.959
article about somebody who is taken in, think about

1521
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.029
how this con artist applied these hooks and habits.

1522
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:30.890
Um Think about from the victim's perspective, which red

1523
01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:33.229
flags did they miss because they were too focused

1524
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.779
or because they didn't ask another question when you

1525
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:38.709
start examining the scans and scams in that way,

1526
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.979
kind of as we did over the course of

1527
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:42.540
doing our research for the book, you start to

1528
01:15:42.549 --> 01:15:45.000
see the patterns and you start to recognizing, start

1529
01:15:45.009 --> 01:15:46.740
to recognize when something is maybe a little too

1530
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.060
good to be true. Um So I think it's,

1531
01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.660
I think that's the best approach in general is

1532
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:55.109
to try and understand it from the perspective of

1533
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.879
the, of the victim in that moment and how

1534
01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:01.879
they were targeted and how they um how the

1535
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.500
con artist applied these tricks, um took advantage of

1536
01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:05.740
them.

1537
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:10.089
Great. So the book is again, nobody is full.

1538
01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.040
Why we get taken in and what we can

1539
01:16:12.049 --> 01:16:14.009
do about it. I'm leaving a link to it

1540
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.229

1541
01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.609

1544
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.009
