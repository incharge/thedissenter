Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.969
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.800
joined by Doctor Caleb Everett, is a senior associate

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.989
in the College of Arts and Sciences at the

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.920
University of Miami and a professor in the anthropology

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.100
department with the secondary appointment in psychology. And today

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.579
we're talking about his latest book, a Myriad of

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.610
tongues. Our languages reveal differences in how we think.

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.049
So. Doctor Everett, welcome to the show. It's a

10
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.370
big pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.430
Well, thanks for having me. It's great to be

12
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.740
here.

13
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.220
So, as a linguist, uh and since the book

14
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.209
is basically about linguistic diversity and our languages are

15
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.270
so diverse in many different kinds of aspects and

16
00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:46.740
we'll get into some of those aspects. But I

17
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.099
would like to start by asking you, do you

18
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.180
think that in linguistics, particularly nowadays, people still tend

19
00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:58.840
to assume too much universality in language?

20
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.400
Yeah, I would say so. And that's one of

21
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.259
the cases made in the book and I'm not

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.699
the only one making that case to be clear

23
00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:10.000
these days. Um There, there's been an assumption of

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.300
that. At least some features of languages are universal.

25
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:17.139
And I think increasingly that argument is, is harder

26
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.970
to support. Basically, as linguists have done more research

27
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.230
in different parts of the world um with different

28
00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:28.830
populations that are not western, educated, industrialized, rich democracies,

29
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:32.209
these so called weird societies. And as the focus

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.769
of linguistic research has been less European or indo-european,

31
00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:40.730
let's say, um I think that the the evidence

32
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.209
for universals in, in language are, are really uh

33
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.459
harder and harder. The evidence is harder and harder

34
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.750
to come by. There are still some who think

35
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.569
that there are some core tenets of language that

36
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.129
are universal. I'm not one of those folks. Um

37
00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:55.930
There are some reasonable arguments, I just think it's

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.739
harder and harder to support. And as I said,

39
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.099
there are a number of linguists that have been

40
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.480
making this case now for a while and this

41
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.190
book helps to synthesize some of the work of

42
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:06.599
those scholars.

43
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.889
But when it comes to the differences, we find

44
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.990
across languages, I mean, of course, this is a

45
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.770
very broad question but where would you say those

46
00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:22.250
differences stem from primarily?

47
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.070
I mean, that's a good question. So some of

48
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.679
the things relate to say, just the different usage

49
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.679
of function of the functional usage of certain linguistic

50
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.889
forms in certain contexts, right? So you can think

51
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.279
of something like like my last book was about

52
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.679
numbers and number words and things like that. And

53
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.080
it's clear that there are pressures on cultures in

54
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.779
certain contexts to develop number words more than in

55
00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.279
other contexts, right? It's not that one is better

56
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.259
or worse. It's just that there are pressures in

57
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.539
certain contexts to develop certain features of certain linguistic

58
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.169
features. Some of it is a lot more analogous

59
00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.380
to what we might think of as genetic drift,

60
00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.589
right? Where it's just there are differences that crop

61
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.960
up in populations. When you have thousands of populations

62
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.880
living around the world, there are going to be

63
00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.960
certain differences in speech and in cultural norms that

64
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.929
develop that maybe have no like clear motivation, they

65
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.619
just are differences, right? And that, that's a big

66
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.169
part of you get these, you know, probabilistic tendencies

67
00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.929
across languages and then you and these are gonna

68
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.380
just operate in different ways in different contexts. So

69
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.289
those, those are part of the reasons for the

70
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.729
differences. Another potential reason for some of the differences

71
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.229
are uh environmental differences, right? So some of this

72
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.440
might be really obvious, like if you're, if you're

73
00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.289
a hunter gather group in Amazonia, you might have

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.619
a greater need to distinguish certain um flora and

75
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.330
fauna around you in more precise ways than say

76
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.229
I would, right. So, you know, um for instance,

77
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.770
some of the people that I've worked with in,

78
00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.660
in the Amazon, um the Kiana, they have a

79
00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.460
variety of different words for, for monkey species. Um

80
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.479
But there's no like sort of super ordinate term

81
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.059
of monkey because that's less of a useful feet,

82
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.809
like it's very important for them to break things

83
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.550
down into the individual. Whereas for, for me, even

84
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.369
though I know there are lots of terms for

85
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.210
these species in English, I don't know them. Right.

86
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.960
So I call a lot of, I have like

87
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.619
a few different terms for monkey. Now, that's something

88
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.959
that's clearly impacted in one way or another by

89
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.589
the environment. So you get this collage of motivations

90
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.059
for why languages differ, those, those are a few

91
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.769
of them anyway.

92
00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:28.950
And another one of those reasons has to do

93
00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:34.170
with uh people's specific social needs. Correct?

94
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.529
Yeah. So social units, so like the kind of

95
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.279
um kinship terms that they have, you know, this,

96
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.809
this, this reflects, you know, critical differences in, in

97
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.040
terms of how the social units are constructed within

98
00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:52.320
societies. There's some research suggesting that um you know,

99
00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:56.790
languages spoken by larger populations have some differences, some

100
00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:00.320
tendencies in contrast to languages spoken by very small

101
00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:04.859
populations. Um That's something that's hotly debated amongst linguists

102
00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:07.799
and amongst other cognitive scientists. But yeah, there do

103
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.869
seem to be, there is some evidence that um

104
00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:15.519
varying social pressures across groups impact how languages evolve.

105
00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:20.619
So let's get into a few concrete examples here

106
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.470
in the book, you talk about time, for example.

107
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.519
So what do we know about how people think

108
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.149
about time and what relationship does that have with

109
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.540
uh language?

110
00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:37.570
Yeah, that's a really good question. So when you,

111
00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:39.529
when I I mean, I'll give you an anecdote,

112
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.649
like when I, when I teach um a linguistics

113
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.010
course here at the University of Miami, and I

114
00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:47.339
ask students how you think about time and they'll,

115
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.929
they'll often start talking about past, present and future

116
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.570
as though these are sort of, you know, immutable

117
00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:55.929
categories that exist. And obviously, in some ways, we

118
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.910
all experience time. You know, the claim in the

119
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.410
book is not that the language you speak totally

120
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.660
changes your perception of time passing itself. But it

121
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.359
comes as a surprise to some students, to most

122
00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:10.720
students that many languages don't have three tenses. You

123
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.809
know, many languages have only two tenses, some languages

124
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.899
have no tenses, some languages have as many as

125
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.970
seven tenses. And so this this reflects the fact

126
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.700
that that how we delineate time linguistically can vary

127
00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:29.859
sometimes more than people realize, right, whether that has

128
00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.239
any effect on how people think about time when

129
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.640
it comes to tense less clear. Um But there

130
00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.769
are some other examples of the way that we

131
00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:42.000
talk about time that seem to indicate that there

132
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.910
are these associated differences in how people think about

133
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.700
time. So the common metaphor of the the past

134
00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.799
being behind you and the future being in front

135
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:53.119
of you. That's not something that we have in

136
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.269
English and that exists in a number of languages

137
00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.829
around the world. That's not a metaphor that exists

138
00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.760
in all the world's languages, right? So in many

139
00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.760
languages, some talked about in the book, you talk

140
00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:04.779
about the past as though it is in front

141
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.119
of you. And the future is though it's behind

142
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.929
you. And researchers that have, have studied these groups

143
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.690
have shown, for instance that when they're talking about

144
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.760
the past, they oftentimes point in front of themselves,

145
00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.079
right? Whereas in English, when we talk about the

146
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.549
past, we tend to point backwards, right? So this

147
00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:26.440
seems to reflect these gestures seem to reflect some

148
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.619
wider cognitive processes that are, that are sort of

149
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.989
being indicated by the the metaphors that we use.

150
00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:35.559
Or you could say that the metaphors themselves are

151
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.709
somehow impacting how we think about the passing of

152
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.950
time. One of the really fascinating examples in the

153
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.820
book is from a group of people called the

154
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.420
Eno in New Guinea. And this is research done

155
00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:51.220
by other folks at the University of California, San

156
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.149
Diego and other places showing that in that language,

157
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.320
they tend to talk about the time is flowing

158
00:07:57.329 --> 00:08:01.179
uphill, you know, so whether you point in front

159
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.940
of you or behind you depends on which way

160
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.179
you're facing on a hill at the time that

161
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.190
you're talking. And you can imagine that if you're

162
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.000
trying to learn that language, as you say, an

163
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.640
anthropological linguist, trying to figure that out, it must

164
00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:14.910
be really tricky to figure that out, right? But

165
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.649
then you talk to someone who speaks a language

166
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.720
like that and it might seem very natural to

167
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.019
them. I think that's one of the interesting things

168
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:23.850
is that these ways of talking about time and

169
00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:27.329
gesturing about time come to seem very natural as

170
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.260
though it's like just the default human experience. When

171
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:33.299
in reality it clearly isn't. There's some, there's more

172
00:08:33.308 --> 00:08:35.880
variability there than, than people often realize.

173
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.830
So, since you've done work on numbers does the

174
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.969
way we talk about time connect in any way

175
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.940
to the way we talk about numbers. I I'm

176
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.530
asking you that also because I mean, at least

177
00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:53.580
in more Western languages, I, I'm not sure about

178
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.700
the universality of this or not, but we tend

179
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:02.229
also to subdivide time in terms of hours, minutes,

180
00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:05.659
seconds, I mean, count basically the passage of time

181
00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:09.770
in that way. So uh is there some connection

182
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.080
there? Yeah,

183
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.400
I think so. I mean, I think it's, it's

184
00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:16.030
almost hard to overstate what a difference that makes,

185
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.330
right? So if you talk about, um there was

186
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.669
some research done with an Amazonian group about 10

187
00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.900
years ago. The Tupi kawa is the name of

188
00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:25.409
the language anyway. And this is not that far

189
00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.039
from where I've done some of my research in

190
00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:30.049
the Amazon. And there's not any evidence that they

191
00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:33.119
talk about time and hardly at all right. There's

192
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.369
really not much concrete evidence of that and they

193
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.150
don't seem to use the metaphors for time, any

194
00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:41.630
of the metaphors that I just mentioned, like future

195
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.130
being in front of you past being behind you.

196
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.169
So you can imagine that in a group like

197
00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:49.210
that when there aren't many words that are associated

198
00:09:49.219 --> 00:09:51.690
with things related to time, of course, that doesn't

199
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.890
mean people aren't experiencing time in that group. But

200
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.750
the point is that they don't have words for

201
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.549
things like week or month or, or, um, season

202
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:02.969
perhaps. But in a context like that, you can

203
00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:05.700
think about how foreign, something like hours and minutes

204
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.114
and seconds seconds are, right. And these sort of

205
00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.875
linguistic units pretty much govern our lives, right? Like

206
00:10:12.885 --> 00:10:15.294
everything about our lives is constrained by hours and

207
00:10:15.304 --> 00:10:18.114
minutes and seconds. And if you think about the

208
00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:21.015
origins of these terms, they're very much related to

209
00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:24.044
the numerical systems of other languages, some of which

210
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:26.525
are now extinct, right? So if you the base

211
00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:31.090
60 system, you know, 60 minutes, 60 seconds that

212
00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:33.690
comes from really can be traced back to Ancient

213
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.849
Mesopotamia where there was a base 60 number system.

214
00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:39.700
And then that influenced the tracking of time in

215
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.549
different places, including Ancient Greece and then made its

216
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:46.619
way into Europe, right? Um, IN terms of 12

217
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.270
hours, that's something that goes back to Egyptian sun

218
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.469
dials thousands of years ago where they had 10

219
00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:55.599
units for the sun dial for dividing the day

220
00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:58.090
up and then they added a unit for dawn

221
00:10:58.099 --> 00:11:00.349
and a unit for dusk. You know, when the

222
00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.640
light, when the sun's not completely up, but it's

223
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.510
light out and then, so that's how you get

224
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.719
12, right? And then if you do that at

225
00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:09.989
night too, eventually we had the people had the

226
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.190
idea to divide the night up into equal units

227
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.500
also. So you can see how you go when

228
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.250
you count hours and minutes, you're going from something

229
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.969
that's influenced by Ancient Egyptian sundials to ancient Mesopotamian

230
00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:27.169
number systems to then the decimal number system that

231
00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:29.489
we all take for granted. So you're kind of

232
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.250
as you tell time, you're kind of taking a

233
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.880
trip through time through these different eras. And so

234
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.599
this is kind of all this cultural residue that

235
00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:40.760
has been, you know, acquired in our, in our

236
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:43.840
uh tracking of time. But we learn it, we

237
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:46.080
take it for granted and obviously, it affects how

238
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.710
we think in some level because we're constantly thinking

239
00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:51.530
about hours and minutes and seconds and how much

240
00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:53.590
longer do we have before the next meeting or

241
00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:56.799
whatever? It very much governs our lives. So, so,

242
00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:58.260
yeah, I think it's, it's fair to say that

243
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.469
there's some influence of thought uh based on our

244
00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:03.530
number systems on how we think about time.

245
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.239
Uh So when it comes to numbers, uh if

246
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.320
what I'm about to say is outdated, please correct

247
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.080
me. But uh I read some time ago that

248
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.690
at least in more traditional societies like hunter gatherers,

249
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.460
horticulturalists and so on that when it comes to

250
00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:27.289
counting, people usually count up to three, sometimes five

251
00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:30.469
and then they just use words like our terms

252
00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:34.549
like, uh, a few, many a lot. And so

253
00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:38.840
it's just in societies where we have really formal

254
00:12:38.849 --> 00:12:43.489
schooling that we count beyond, beyond three or five.

255
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.739
I mean, is that true? I mean,

256
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.010
yeah, that's, that's not an inaccurate generalization. I mean,

257
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.344
it's definitely a general, there are exceptions. Right. There

258
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.424
are plenty of, um, hunter gatherer groups, especially one

259
00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:56.094
of the things about number systems is they spread

260
00:12:56.104 --> 00:12:58.924
very quickly, right? Like people tend to see how

261
00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:02.034
useful they are or they have economic pressures to

262
00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:03.934
get to know numbers so that they're not taken

263
00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:06.325
advantage of. And so they can sort of spread

264
00:13:06.335 --> 00:13:09.114
like this cognitive fire. But it is true that

265
00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:12.854
there are some very simple number systems in hunter

266
00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:14.674
gatherer groups where there doesn't seem to be a

267
00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:17.875
lot of usefulness maybe to number systems in ways

268
00:13:17.885 --> 00:13:20.500
that there might be for us. And obviously, it's

269
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.599
not because these people are incapable of learning numbers.

270
00:13:22.609 --> 00:13:24.760
It's just that they haven't developed in their society.

271
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.789
A famous case is, um the PETA Ha in

272
00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.580
the Amazon. This is a group I've spent some

273
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.059
time with the work of my father made this

274
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.570
group famous. Um, BUT they have basically no numbers

275
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.789
at all, no precise numbers. And some cognitive scientists

276
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:43.750
um went from Berkeley and mit went down there

277
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.700
and sort of helped demonstrate this experimentally. So that's

278
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.700
one that's an extreme case. There seemed to be

279
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.130
maybe a couple of cases like that worldwide where

280
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.000
there's no precise number of words at all in

281
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.159
a group. What's more common is what you're talking

282
00:13:56.169 --> 00:14:00.380
about a, a 12 mini system or a 123

283
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.929
mini system or some groups that do have elaborate

284
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.190
number systems, but maybe they're just not used as

285
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.150
frequently. So, um I worked with this one group

286
00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.210
but this was over 10 years ago. Um THAT

287
00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:15.280
had number words that it was thought that they

288
00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:17.340
didn't have number words when I did some experiments

289
00:14:17.349 --> 00:14:18.830
with them, it was clear that they do have

290
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.280
number words, but it wasn't clear how many people

291
00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:24.539
in the culture knew them. Right. So, some of

292
00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:26.489
the, some of the older men that I talked

293
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.140
to seem to know the number system that they

294
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.770
had used when, when hunting or talking about how

295
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.989
long they were going to be gone on a

296
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.130
hunting trip. But I think that's another factor is

297
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.830
how, how, how diffuse are the numbers within a

298
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.840
society for, for societies like ours because you're sort

299
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:44.280
of, they're inculcated in us from a really young

300
00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:47.080
age, like you're just taught numbers. And again, it's

301
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.359
another thing that just comes to seem to be

302
00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:51.890
like a default way of how the world works.

303
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.989
And we don't realize that these are actually sort

304
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.049
of culturally specific things that we're acquiring as, as

305
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:01.359
we're raised in a numerate culture.

306
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:05.570
Mhm. So, we've sort of already made reference to

307
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.630
this. But, uh, when we talked about, for example,

308
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.469
how certain people tend to think about, uh, time,

309
00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:15.309
uh, uh, uh, if we're talking about the past

310
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.890
back then or in front of them or something

311
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.840
like that. So there's already somewhat of a rela,

312
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.559
uh, of a relationship between time and space there.

313
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.679
But looking across languages, I mean, how much really

314
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.349
is there of a relationship between how we talk

315
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:36.229
about time and how we talk about space?

316
00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:39.299
I mean, that's a really good question. Um Another

317
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:41.549
thing that's been debated, but it's pretty clear that

318
00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:46.090
cultures in general make use of space to talk

319
00:15:46.099 --> 00:15:48.619
about time, right? Time is this really abstract thing,

320
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.460
we can't reach out and touch it. It's not

321
00:15:50.469 --> 00:15:55.130
like around us. And so mapping time onto space,

322
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.419
which is more concrete and we can talk about

323
00:15:57.429 --> 00:15:59.099
it as being in front of us or it

324
00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:01.609
helps us make sense of this very nebulous thing

325
00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:03.299
of the passing of time, right? Even as I

326
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:05.739
say that I'm saying, the passing of time and

327
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.039
obviously that's a spatial thing too, like time is

328
00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:10.659
not really passing. And so there have been some

329
00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:15.969
suggestions that every culture, they may talk about time

330
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.390
in terms of space in different ways, like the

331
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.719
examples I gave before. But every culture talks about

332
00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:25.940
time in terms of space somehow. But there again

333
00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.229
that there's been suggestions that that is not a

334
00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.349
universal, it's just a tendency because we seem to,

335
00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.190
for everything that we say, oh, this is a

336
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.869
universal of how people talk. Inevitably someone will come

337
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.359
back and say now I've been working with this

338
00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:42.330
group for, you know, 10 years and I swear

339
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.799
they don't do that. You know, it's like, it's

340
00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:47.270
more of a sampling problem than anything. There, there

341
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.099
could be that certainly does seem to be a

342
00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:53.340
very strong tendency though, across human populations. People like

343
00:16:53.349 --> 00:16:55.559
to make sense of time in terms of space.

344
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.369
Another very interesting thing related to space is how

345
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.170
we use directions. Like for example, we in our

346
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.949
western languages tend to use left and right. But

347
00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:11.260
there are other languages where people actually use cardinal

348
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.339
orientations like east and west. So do we know

349
00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:19.130
exactly why there are those differences?

350
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.260
I mean, that's a good, that's another great question.

351
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.270
I think in terms of why the differences exist,

352
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.560
it's, it's always easy to debate, right? We can

353
00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.569
come up with different ideas like, so what you're

354
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:34.189
talking about in terms of egocentric directions, right, based

355
00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:38.140
on the body, like left versus right, these very

356
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.619
common worldwide. And it's another thing that at some

357
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.079
point people said, well, this is just a universal

358
00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:46.300
humans think about space in terms of centered around

359
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.459
their body. And so they're always going to describe

360
00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:51.189
things as being, they're going to use some egocentric

361
00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:53.359
system. It may not be left versus right, but

362
00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:55.650
it's going to be something like that. And then

363
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.689
inevitably, it turns out there are plenty of groups

364
00:17:57.699 --> 00:17:59.800
that don't do that. So some of them are

365
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.339
more geocentric which, you know, centered around features of

366
00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.780
the earth or this could be something like, you

367
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.689
know, like you said, cardinal directions like east versus

368
00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:12.050
west, north versus south. And then it turns out

369
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.630
there are plenty of groups where it might not

370
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.800
exactly be those directions, but the way that they

371
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.300
give spatial reference, the way that they talk about

372
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.750
spatial references or give directions tend to be geocentric.

373
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.260
It's not left versus right, it's not centered on

374
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.719
the human body. And so there the differences in

375
00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:33.229
spatial uh terminology and how people refer to the

376
00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:37.390
space around themselves turns out are much greater than

377
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.949
people once thought back in the say seventies and

378
00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:43.510
eighties. And basically, since the nineties, there's been increasing

379
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.530
research showing that people think about space and really

380
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.500
diverse ways now why those differences exist? That's, you

381
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.000
know, we can debate how much of that is

382
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.010
just like what I said earlier, something analogous to

383
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.390
genetic drift where it's just like people are going

384
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.170
to do things differently in different contexts. They just,

385
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.839
I think there are some some ways of talking

386
00:19:02.849 --> 00:19:05.989
about space that are clearly more likely to develop

387
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.510
in certain areas. So like things that are centered

388
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.050
around the sun, right? Or where are probably more

389
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.089
like there's going to be some bias towards like

390
00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:18.849
equatorial sunny regions, right? Where east tends to be

391
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.420
in a clear direction and west tends to be

392
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.250
in the clear direction. You can imagine why that

393
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.569
might be less likely to develop in high latitudes

394
00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:29.150
or something like that where east and west aren't

395
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.229
so, so obvious. Um But you know, these, these

396
00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:37.119
environmental effects seem to be subtle and they're not

397
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.489
deterministic, like we can't just say, oh, this, this

398
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.280
language is spoken here and so the people probably

399
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.719
talk about space this way, right? Um There are

400
00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:47.699
a number of cultures though where they talk about

401
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.979
directions in terms of uphill or downhill, you know,

402
00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:54.390
in a certain plane. And it's not necessarily the

403
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.869
immediate hill that they're on, but it's the general

404
00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.770
trajectory of the geography and the surrounding terrain. And

405
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.599
obviously, you wouldn't develop a system like that if

406
00:20:04.609 --> 00:20:07.739
you just live in the plains of North America

407
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.329
or something like that where there aren't a lot

408
00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:11.520
of hills like that, that's pretty clear that there's

409
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.790
some environmental influence. How much is a matter of,

410
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.729
of debate.

411
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.660
So we earlier, we've already touched a little bit

412
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.260
on how languages also influence in a way how

413
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.589
we understand and talk about social relationships. And you

414
00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:32.979
mentioned kinship systems, for example, but it also applies

415
00:20:32.989 --> 00:20:38.869
to things like social groups and classes, race, ethnicity,

416
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.619
gender and so on.

417
00:20:42.229 --> 00:20:44.579
Yeah. Yeah, it, it relates to everything. And so

418
00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:48.069
some of the terms, I mean, gender is a

419
00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:50.680
good one, right? Where there are some languages that

420
00:20:50.689 --> 00:20:53.599
have maybe a, a term for a generic third

421
00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:56.680
gender and a lot of languages. It's just binary.

422
00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.890
Um IN terms of kinship, there, I go into

423
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.199
a few of these things in the books, but

424
00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:03.979
there are entire volumes dedicated to differences in kinship

425
00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:06.489
terms because they can be very extreme, right? So

426
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.550
whether or not um like one feature that I

427
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.859
think is interesting because I've come across it in

428
00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:14.599
some of my own work is age differences in

429
00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:17.390
kinship, right? So in the example of the Carico,

430
00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:21.430
where you have differences between that brother and sister,

431
00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:24.280
there's no term, just brother or sister, the the

432
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.810
term sister, like there's a term for older sister,

433
00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:29.209
there's a term for younger sister, but you're always

434
00:21:29.219 --> 00:21:31.839
kind of referencing your age and relationship to the

435
00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:34.640
people around you in your kinship network. And that

436
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:39.750
kind of, you know, reciprocity of reference to age

437
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.770
is something that we're not that familiar with. It

438
00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.500
can feel a little bit strange, but, you know,

439
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.239
after you spend enough time talking to people like

440
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.729
that, that these are clearly very important aspects of

441
00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:52.890
their, of their kinship system. And so I think

442
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.060
that's kind of the interesting thing is that people

443
00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:59.219
have different kinship systems, they have very different terms

444
00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:02.569
for the different, you know, nodes within that kinship

445
00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:05.880
system. And then this kind of reinforces certain way

446
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.089
of thinking about relationships.

447
00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:11.430
Mhm. Uh In the book, you also get a

448
00:22:11.439 --> 00:22:15.430
little bit into how we talk about colors and

449
00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:20.349
smells and uh how that influences how we remember

450
00:22:20.369 --> 00:22:24.380
visual and olfactory stimuli. So, could you tell us

451
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.229
a bit about that?

452
00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:28.949
Yeah. So this is research that goes back decades

453
00:22:28.959 --> 00:22:32.119
now. Um It's, it's been evolving over the last

454
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.630
few decades, let's say. So. Um THERE, there have

455
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.109
been these surveys done starting with color terms. Um

456
00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:42.280
uh Berlin and k these two scholars, they did

457
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.810
this, they did this influential book um over, I

458
00:22:45.819 --> 00:22:48.709
guess it's been about 50 years now and they

459
00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:51.469
demonstrating the differences in color terms across a lot

460
00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:54.439
of the world's languages. And the basic way that

461
00:22:54.449 --> 00:22:58.660
this works is um researchers in different places give

462
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.680
uh paint chips, color chips to different groups and

463
00:23:01.689 --> 00:23:03.939
have them name them, you know, a whole array

464
00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:06.300
of different hues and see where do they break

465
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.099
up color terms? Are there differences across languages in

466
00:23:09.109 --> 00:23:11.319
terms of how the hues are broken up? And

467
00:23:11.329 --> 00:23:12.920
it turns out there are actually a lot of

468
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.959
differences and there are a lot of differences in

469
00:23:14.969 --> 00:23:18.880
terms of the number of terms that, that uh

470
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:23.530
languages have so called basic color words. There are

471
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.910
some suggestions that some languages don't really have basic

472
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.010
color words. But setting that aside, most languages have

473
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.260
somewhere between three and 11, basic color terms. So

474
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.140
there's a lot of variation, but then there still

475
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.869
are some tendencies, which is really maybe not too

476
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.140
surprising because we all have the same visual apparatus,

477
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.160
we're all seeing the world in, in roughly the

478
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.069
same way. However, there is some evidence that the

479
00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:49.910
some of the languages color term distinctions impact in

480
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.839
subtle ways how people think about colors, or at

481
00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:55.680
least how they group them in certain cognitive tasks

482
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.310
and their, their capacity to recall certain color terms.

483
00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:02.780
So if you, if your language makes, it makes

484
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.410
a color term distinction between blue and green, for

485
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:11.089
instance, which many languages do not. Um There's evidence

486
00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:15.510
that when you perceive um colors stimuli that that

487
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.119
are on different sides of that border blue versus

488
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.140
green, you're more likely to recall that difference in

489
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.260
some experimental tasks, right? So no one makes the

490
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.709
claim that like these are huge differences, right? A

491
00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:29.969
lot of these things can get distorted, these are

492
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:34.459
probably fairly minor differences. Um BUT it's still interesting,

493
00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:36.709
right? Because it suggests that the language that you

494
00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:39.359
speak impacts in subtle ways how you perform on

495
00:24:39.369 --> 00:24:41.479
certain visual tasks, right?

496
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.849
Uh But uh I mean, that's about basically recalling

497
00:24:46.859 --> 00:24:51.319
certain callers and smells, for example, but do, do

498
00:24:51.329 --> 00:24:57.280
we know if language actually influences what people see

499
00:24:57.339 --> 00:25:00.449
and smell? Is that something that happens or not?

500
00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:00.540
I

501
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.849
mean, there is some research on this, I I

502
00:25:02.859 --> 00:25:05.719
don't how they see and how they smell is

503
00:25:05.729 --> 00:25:07.959
maybe too strongly worded, but I do think some

504
00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:10.479
of the results are surprising, right? So that there's

505
00:25:10.489 --> 00:25:14.689
some evidence that like being presented with um verbal

506
00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:18.540
stimuli impacts the likelihood that you're going to discriminate

507
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.239
certain colors in a visual task, right? Um So,

508
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.339
and you know, and then obviously, if your language

509
00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:28.160
doesn't have those words as verbal stimuli, maybe that

510
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.459
affects how you do in certain visual tasks. But

511
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.959
I, and, and there, by the way, there is

512
00:25:32.969 --> 00:25:35.229
a bunch of research now coming out suggesting that

513
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.270
words for smells vary more radically across cultures than

514
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.959
we once thought. And that some cultures have abstract

515
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.349
odor terms that are more analogous to our abstract

516
00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:48.089
color terms. You know, for instance, in English instance

517
00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:51.109
in English, we don't really have abstract odor terms

518
00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:53.000
to the extent that some of these other languages

519
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.260
now seem we we're seeing that they do have

520
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.800
whether that actually impacts how you smell, you know,

521
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.229
that's a different question, but there's some evidence. But

522
00:26:03.239 --> 00:26:06.260
I would say that it's that the, you know,

523
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.469
it's not like huge. I I never want to

524
00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:10.569
give like when I'm talking about this stuff in

525
00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:12.500
class, I never want to give students the impression

526
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.890
that like it just changes how you see completely.

527
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.729
I think that kind of view was romanticized way

528
00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:23.140
too much and it as a result, it made

529
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.420
some um scholars more skeptical of any differences, right,

530
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.339
that there's any differences in thought based on language

531
00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:33.670
and the the claims these days are more subtle

532
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.069
than that. Yeah, but yes, there, there do seem

533
00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.770
to be some effects. It's just the size of

534
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.739
those effects is, is debatable.

535
00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:43.060
Yeah, I, I ask you, I asked you that

536
00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:46.930
because actually, I mean, perhaps a while ago there

537
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:50.410
was a period of time where certain people were

538
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.594
claiming or almost claiming. Actually that perhaps the way

539
00:26:55.604 --> 00:26:58.964
we talk, the words we used to refer to

540
00:26:58.974 --> 00:27:03.765
colors, actually, it changed our visual system when it

541
00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:07.765
came to how we process colors and we would

542
00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:12.234
be able to identify some and completely miss others

543
00:27:12.244 --> 00:27:15.074
or something like that. But perhaps that's too strong,

544
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:17.349
it might be too strong. But I, I don't

545
00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:19.390
wanna, I don't wanna be dismissive of all that

546
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.459
work either because I do think there's some really

547
00:27:21.469 --> 00:27:24.569
careful experimental work showing. So I'll give you an

548
00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:26.300
example of a study. I don't know if I

549
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.530
talk about this in this book, but like, you

550
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.489
know, research showing that people are better at discriminating

551
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.209
certain colors presented to the right visual field, which

552
00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:37.670
is processed by the left hemisphere where most of

553
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.260
our language processing typically happens. And they show that

554
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.209
the color discrimination differs for the right visual field

555
00:27:46.359 --> 00:27:48.619
depending on the color terms that you have in

556
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.819
your language, right? So that is an example of

557
00:27:50.829 --> 00:27:53.660
sort of an effect on how people are actually

558
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.189
immediately discriminating colors, right? So that's so I, I

559
00:27:58.199 --> 00:27:59.670
don't want to give the impression that there's no

560
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.880
evidence for any of this stuff. It's just sometimes

561
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.890
people get the sense that like, oh you just

562
00:28:05.979 --> 00:28:08.489
in the popular media, maybe the the uptake of

563
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.660
some of that work sometimes is just oversimplified to

564
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.709
the point that it seems like if you don't

565
00:28:13.719 --> 00:28:17.400
speak a language with green and blue distinctions, you're

566
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.380
really just not gonna, everything's just gonna be collapsed

567
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.160
visually and that's not what the research suggests, but

568
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.699
there do seem to be some effects.

569
00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:30.920
So earlier, we've also mentioned briefly how the physical

570
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.489
environment can influence our particular languages evolve. And in

571
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.930
the book, you go through the example of extreme

572
00:28:38.939 --> 00:28:43.660
ambient aridity. So ho how does that particular kind

573
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.739
of environment influence our languages or particular languages have

574
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.359
evolved?

575
00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:53.709
Um Yeah, that's a, that's probably of the research

576
00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:57.160
I've done. That's the most hotly contested research, right?

577
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.270
Because um whenever you suggest environmental influences on language,

578
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.859
it turns out there's there's some things that make

579
00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:07.920
people uncomfortable about that, I think. Um BUT I

580
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.300
would argue that that's actually almost a boring thing,

581
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.050
right? Like where there's plenty of research in the

582
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.839
lab showing that really dry air affects how the

583
00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:21.829
vocal cords operate, right? That's not controversial. That's in

584
00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:24.319
fact well established and you kind of know this

585
00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.719
from personal experience, right? Like even if you spend

586
00:29:26.729 --> 00:29:28.849
a couple of days in the desert, not drinking

587
00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:31.329
too much, um you can sort of see effects

588
00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:33.550
on your vocal cords. Now, the question is, does

589
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.550
that kind of thing impact how languages evolve? And

590
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.150
so I had this paper with um uh two

591
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.239
colleagues of mine, uh Damian Blasi and Sean Roberts.

592
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.300
This was quite a while now ago now um

593
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.219
in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,

594
00:29:47.229 --> 00:29:51.510
and we suggested that in really dry places, um

595
00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:55.859
complex tones which require precision of the vocal cords

596
00:29:55.869 --> 00:29:59.109
might be less likely to evolve. This was one

597
00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.849
of those things that got caught by the media

598
00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:03.319
and I would say really oversimplified by the media.

599
00:30:03.329 --> 00:30:06.119
And so it, it created, that was part of

600
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.140
what created some of the headaches, right? Was that

601
00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.890
people they the uptake seemed to be that we

602
00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.410
were suggesting that wherever the language is spoken, you

603
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.949
could predict whether it's tonal or not. And we

604
00:30:18.959 --> 00:30:23.089
weren't even suggesting a broad association between humidity and,

605
00:30:23.219 --> 00:30:25.979
and complex tones. We were just saying, hey, in

606
00:30:25.989 --> 00:30:29.979
really dry places, maybe it's less likely that they

607
00:30:29.989 --> 00:30:33.560
would evolve, given this research in the lab on

608
00:30:33.569 --> 00:30:36.849
how the vocal cords work. And then we showed

609
00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:39.760
a lot of data cross linguistically across the thousands

610
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.319
of languages that seem consistent with that, but it's

611
00:30:43.329 --> 00:30:45.989
ultimately correlational. So you can debate it whether or

612
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.739
not that's actually, and it's been hotly debated since

613
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.459
then. Basically, there was, I should say a really

614
00:30:51.469 --> 00:30:55.290
cool study um by some Chinese scholars this year

615
00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:59.270
after my book was already off to press that

616
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.609
offered, I think even better evidence for this than

617
00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:04.310
we did. Because one of the things they these

618
00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.229
Chinese scholars did was they looked at a million

619
00:31:07.239 --> 00:31:12.319
actual audio files um by people that these audio

620
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.219
files were recorded all over China. And what they

621
00:31:14.229 --> 00:31:17.599
found was that in really dry places, you can

622
00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.670
see even in natural speech outside the lab that

623
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.630
there's an effect of dry air on the precision

624
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.290
with which the vocal cords vibrate. So that doesn't

625
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.709
mean that we were definitely on the right track,

626
00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:31.729
but it's suggestive that, you know, at least in

627
00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:34.329
that case, there does seem to be ambient influence

628
00:31:34.339 --> 00:31:36.510
on how the vocal cords operate which again, and

629
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.270
I don't find that uh particularly shocking or surprising,

630
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.030
but it uh I have to be honest and

631
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.650
say it's still very hotly debated,

632
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.469
you know, when it comes to en environment to

633
00:31:46.479 --> 00:31:48.729
the influence of the environment. One thing that I

634
00:31:48.739 --> 00:31:51.780
got across a few years ago that really fascinated

635
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:56.689
me was uh the existence of whistled languages, like

636
00:31:56.699 --> 00:32:00.359
for example, in Greece, in mountainous places, there are

637
00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:03.694
uh a few communities where people in instead of

638
00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:08.204
really actually talking, they whistle to one another because

639
00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:10.864
I mean, they are very far apart because of

640
00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:13.584
the mountainous terrain and all of that. And so

641
00:32:13.594 --> 00:32:16.864
it's easier for them to convey information by whistling

642
00:32:16.875 --> 00:32:20.895
than by just talking to each other. And uh

643
00:32:20.915 --> 00:32:27.145
there are actual whistled languages or whistled versions of

644
00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:27.905
languages.

645
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.050
Yeah, there are. And you, you're, you're absolutely right

646
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.619
that they tend to be. There are some in

647
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.459
some dense jungle regions in, in Amazonia even. But

648
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.479
there is this tendency for them to be in

649
00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:44.089
mountainous terrain in Turkey, in Greece, in, um, Canary

650
00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:49.390
Islands in Central America. And so one plausible interpretation

651
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.930
is the one that you just gave, right, you

652
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:53.800
can see people at great distances in these places,

653
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.780
but you can't really communicate in the absence of

654
00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.489
these whistled frequencies that allow you to communicate. Right.

655
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.209
That's a clear and I think that's less controversial.

656
00:33:03.219 --> 00:33:05.839
However, it also gets at what's tricky about some

657
00:33:05.849 --> 00:33:08.660
of these hypotheses, which is that at the end

658
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.560
of the day, it's a very small number of

659
00:33:10.569 --> 00:33:14.800
data points. So it's hard to say, to establish

660
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.410
definitively that that's why, you know, because there are

661
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.869
always exceptions, languages that are spoken in the dense

662
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.739
Amazon or something like that and aren't in the

663
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.969
same places. But yeah, I think it's totally reasonable

664
00:33:26.979 --> 00:33:27.709
interpretation.

665
00:33:28.849 --> 00:33:31.479
So another thing that, that I would like to

666
00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:33.739
ask you about here is do you think that

667
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.729
there might be some issues when we try to

668
00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:43.880
study grammatical patterns in sort of idealized and written

669
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:49.180
sentences? Because it might not really be representative of

670
00:33:49.189 --> 00:33:53.699
the ways people normally use uh language?

671
00:33:54.729 --> 00:33:58.099
No, I think that's, that's 100% accurate and that,

672
00:33:58.109 --> 00:34:00.930
that's something that, you know, those of us who

673
00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:04.469
have done field research. I mean, these days, a

674
00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:06.239
lot of my research is at a computer with

675
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.250
databases or whatever or even in a lab. But

676
00:34:09.438 --> 00:34:11.899
the field research in some ways is the hardest

677
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.469
work I've ever done because you're in this place

678
00:34:14.478 --> 00:34:17.030
where you're, you're trying to learn another language. But

679
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.478
what you have to go on a lot of

680
00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:24.478
times are idealized, sort of simple clauses that you're

681
00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:28.389
trying to learn and you can, without intention, you

682
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:31.360
know, unintentionally, sometimes you can project a certain kind

683
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.810
of structure on the language that you're learning, right?

684
00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.250
Because you're, even if you're a well trained linguist,

685
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.129
you bring in all these biases of the things

686
00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.570
you want to learn of the kinds of structures

687
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.010
you expect to find. And so you're asking them,

688
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.870
how do you say this, how do you say

689
00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:48.197
that? And we're aware of these things? And people

690
00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:49.618
will say, well, that's not how you really should

691
00:34:49.628 --> 00:34:52.039
do it, but it's really hard to do it

692
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:54.759
any other way because life is too short, you

693
00:34:54.768 --> 00:34:57.698
know, like what's the best way? Well, maybe the

694
00:34:57.708 --> 00:34:59.809
best way is to go spend 20 years with

695
00:34:59.819 --> 00:35:02.918
an indigenous group without bringing your biases and just

696
00:35:02.928 --> 00:35:05.829
try to absorb the language around you and sort

697
00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.979
of pay attention to what's more frequent and what's

698
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:11.549
less frequent. That's pretty much impossible for an academic

699
00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:14.510
career, right? So what you find and this is

700
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.979
alluded to in the book is a lot of

701
00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:19.270
the very best research in my opinion on indigenous

702
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.419
languages comes from missionaries and that's not something we're

703
00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:25.689
always comfortable talking about in academia, but the truth

704
00:35:25.699 --> 00:35:27.770
is, some of them don't do very good work.

705
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.330
Some of them are the only people who have

706
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.530
actually spent decades living with the group and sort

707
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.649
of learning the language to the point that they

708
00:35:34.659 --> 00:35:36.919
can say, you know, during my first two years,

709
00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:39.040
I thought this was how the language works. And

710
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.020
then I found out 10 years later that's not

711
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.949
at all how it works. Right. But that takes

712
00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:45.754
a lot of time. I think that you're totally

713
00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:47.215
right though, in terms of some of the issues,

714
00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:51.324
we bring methodologically what would be useful in some

715
00:35:51.334 --> 00:35:52.985
ways is what we need is what we are

716
00:35:52.995 --> 00:35:57.135
using now in languages like English that inform a

717
00:35:57.145 --> 00:36:00.314
chat GP T huge large language models that are

718
00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:03.810
based on just millions of clauses of data. We

719
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.449
just don't, we're not in a position to get

720
00:36:05.459 --> 00:36:08.889
that level of data from indigenous languages. But maybe

721
00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:10.750
we will be someday, you know, we'll be able

722
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.290
to just record data in massive amounts and be

723
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.850
able to figure out patterns in the data through

724
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.389
um in part through A I and other tools.

725
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.360
Yeah, maybe someday just uh doing some audio recording

726
00:36:25.419 --> 00:36:30.060
of people just naturally talking and then uh through

727
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.770
A I translating that into text and then analyzing

728
00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.810
it or something like

729
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.620
that. Yeah, it's tough when there's not any, you

730
00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.929
know, A I is not going on anything, there's

731
00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:43.449
nothing already available on that language. But yes, you

732
00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:45.810
can see how things might improve in that way.

733
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.850
Um TO be fair. A lot of field linguists

734
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.969
these days, they do record a lot of data,

735
00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:54.709
but then still they have to go through that

736
00:36:54.719 --> 00:36:58.889
data very time consuming. And so, you know, creating

737
00:36:58.899 --> 00:37:02.229
digital corpora of data that they can just analyze

738
00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:06.350
maybe more objectively. That's, that's still very, very time

739
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.979
consuming.

740
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:12.459
So another very interesting question in linguistics is, are,

741
00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:17.959
are words arbitrary? That is uh uh I mean,

742
00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:22.320
are there any patterns in terms of certain meanings

743
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:26.199
tended to be to go associated with certain specific

744
00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:30.000
sounds or even words? I mean, is that something

745
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:35.699
that occurs or are just words basically arbitrary and

746
00:37:35.709 --> 00:37:38.620
any word can mean basically anything?

747
00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:43.780
Yeah, I mean, I think most words probably are

748
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.800
arbitrary and can mean anything. And that's been the

749
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.610
standard line in linguistics research for a while. But

750
00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.719
increasingly, I would say, especially over the last 10

751
00:37:50.729 --> 00:37:54.340
years, there's been AAA growing number of studies showing

752
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:59.260
that more words, words are less arbitrary than we

753
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.469
thought, right? Or at least some words are less

754
00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:05.129
arbitrary than we thought. So there are these systematic

755
00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:10.350
correspondences between sounds and meanings across the world's culture.

756
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.510
So, one of the best studies I know about

757
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.705
this was done by that same colleague I mentioned

758
00:38:15.715 --> 00:38:18.385
earlier, Damian Blasi, where they, he and the team

759
00:38:18.395 --> 00:38:21.675
looked at thousands of languages and they found some

760
00:38:21.685 --> 00:38:26.395
clear associations between certain sounds and certain meanings even

761
00:38:26.405 --> 00:38:29.905
after controlling for a bunch of particular uh influences.

762
00:38:29.915 --> 00:38:32.114
Um So like one example that I'm, if I

763
00:38:32.125 --> 00:38:36.560
recall correctly is um, the word for nose tends

764
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.879
to have a nasal sound in it. So something

765
00:38:39.889 --> 00:38:42.000
like nah, and you can sort of see why

766
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.620
that might be the case, right? When you have

767
00:38:43.629 --> 00:38:46.820
produce a nasal sound frequencies resonate in the nasal

768
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.500
cavity. And so maybe that makes it more perceptually

769
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.239
salient. What was really interesting about that study is

770
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.050
that there are obviously thousands of exceptions, right? It's,

771
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.760
it's these very subtle tendencies that we, there's no

772
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.320
way we could have noticed, you know, say 20

773
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.979
years ago. But as these databases have come online

774
00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:08.090
and as they're being refined, we're starting to be

775
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.120
able to ask these questions in new ways and

776
00:39:10.129 --> 00:39:12.965
test them in new ways. Things like uh is

777
00:39:12.975 --> 00:39:17.135
a sound system impacted by the environment, maybe not.

778
00:39:17.284 --> 00:39:19.544
But we could never really even ask and test

779
00:39:19.554 --> 00:39:23.074
that question before. Are, are this, are languages, are

780
00:39:23.084 --> 00:39:27.104
the words of languages maybe more um systematic in

781
00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:29.225
terms of how they map sounds and meanings than

782
00:39:29.235 --> 00:39:32.159
we once thought. Well, maybe, but we could never

783
00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:34.320
have tested this, you know, say 20 years ago.

784
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.370
So it's requiring new methods, new databases to, to

785
00:39:37.379 --> 00:39:40.760
maybe change our perspectives on some of these topics

786
00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.790
and language research.

787
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.750
And do we have any idea if there are

788
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.389
sort of basic words that occur in uh virtually

789
00:39:50.399 --> 00:39:51.709
all languages,

790
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.080
you just to be clear, do you mean semantics

791
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.070
like in terms of content, like the word meaning

792
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.040
like the word? Yeah, I mean there there have

793
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.080
been some suggestions of this, right? But it's um

794
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.439
so number words have been one of those suggestions,

795
00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:07.729
right? That was one of the ones that at

796
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:10.399
some point people said, OK, language is made different

797
00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:13.229
in terms of how many number words they have

798
00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:15.959
but every language has some precise word for one

799
00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:17.830
and two turns out that doesn't seem to be

800
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.699
the case. Although the vast majority do same with

801
00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:23.199
color terms that used to be thought to be

802
00:40:23.209 --> 00:40:27.219
universal, you know, not so clear anymore. Same with

803
00:40:27.229 --> 00:40:30.610
something like the word for mother. You know, I

804
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.750
increasingly there was this influential article by two linguists

805
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.850
uh Nick Evans and Steven Levinson. This was over

806
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.830
10 years ago now, were entitled The Myth of

807
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.739
Language Universals. And, and they went through some of

808
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.860
these examples showing a lot of these words that

809
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.889
we thought were at least universal. Even these. There,

810
00:40:47.899 --> 00:40:51.360
there always seems to be an exception somewhere, but

811
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:56.060
there's very strong tendencies, right? So like it's, it's

812
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.959
pretty much guaranteed that a language is gonna have,

813
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.939
you know, pick a language at random that it's

814
00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:03.360
gonna have a word for the concept one for

815
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:03.939
instance.

816
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.540
Uh And so I've asked you about uh some

817
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:14.139
of the issues with having to actually have idealized

818
00:41:14.149 --> 00:41:17.750
and written form of a particular language to study

819
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.399
it uh is it really possible to accurately translate

820
00:41:23.409 --> 00:41:26.399
every word and expression?

821
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.310
Yeah, I would say um I would say not,

822
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.070
right. And again, this is going to depend on

823
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.120
how closely related the languages are, how closely related

824
00:41:35.129 --> 00:41:38.820
the cultures are. But I think that we've, even

825
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.439
if you speak two European languages as you do,

826
00:41:41.449 --> 00:41:43.639
at least that many, right? Or like I grew

827
00:41:43.649 --> 00:41:45.479
up in Brazil, I speak is a lot better

828
00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:49.330
than I speak any Amazonian language. Even between Portuguese

829
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.209
and English. I find sometimes that, that there's a

830
00:41:52.219 --> 00:41:54.750
little bit of loss in the translation, right? There's,

831
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.560
there's some cultural nuance that's maybe missed as someone

832
00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.959
translates something into this language. You know that I

833
00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:04.870
like the example of the movie Lost in translation.

834
00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:06.879
You know that the movie entitled Lost in translation

835
00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:10.979
with Bill Murray that was titled very differently in

836
00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:13.429
a lot of different cultures because the expression lost

837
00:42:13.439 --> 00:42:16.850
in translation itself can get lost in translation, right?

838
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.090
It's really hard to have it. Now. That's not

839
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.199
to say that nothing is perfectly translatable. It's just

840
00:42:23.209 --> 00:42:26.219
that a lot of times we're trans translating things

841
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.120
that are maybe almost perfectly translatable, but something is

842
00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:31.870
getting missed. There's some cultural nuance that's not being

843
00:42:31.879 --> 00:42:34.989
conveyed by a phrase in one language uh as

844
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.459
it's translated into another.

845
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.550
Now that that's very interesting also because even when

846
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.489
it comes to Portuguese itself, because we have different

847
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.469
versions of Portuguese, like Brazilian, Portuguese and European Portuguese

848
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:53.379
sometimes since you mentioned lost in translation, the movie,

849
00:42:53.389 --> 00:42:55.919
it came to my mind that sometimes for the

850
00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:59.840
same movie, there are two different titles in Brazil

851
00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.590
and in Portugal. And one of them is better

852
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.649
suited for a Brazilian audience because it combines the

853
00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:11.159
meaning better. And the other one is better suited

854
00:43:11.169 --> 00:43:14.649
for a Portuguese audience even though it's almost the

855
00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:15.600
same language.

856
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:18.270
Yeah, that's a good point because then you're talking

857
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.290
about what, well, essentially dialects of the same language.

858
00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:25.729
Um Although anecdotally, I almost find Spanish easier to

859
00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:29.459
understand than when I'm in Portugal to, you know,

860
00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:32.969
because of the you guys uh from my perspective

861
00:43:32.979 --> 00:43:34.639
as someone who grew up in Brazil, you're dropping

862
00:43:34.649 --> 00:43:37.959
vowels all over the place, you know, but it's,

863
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.290
but I, I love the sound of Brazilian Portuguese.

864
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.040
But yeah, it's clearly, even though it's technically, you

865
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.020
know, I mean, I love the sound of European,

866
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.780
Portuguese even though there's clearly different dialects, European. And

867
00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:50.429
so if that can happen, even within two dialects

868
00:43:50.439 --> 00:43:52.860
is my point, then imagine what can happen when

869
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:57.090
you get to very unrelated languages. Take something like

870
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.669
um Kiana, the language that I mentioned and then

871
00:43:59.679 --> 00:44:03.050
pick some, you know, language in Australia or Eastern

872
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.330
China or wherever you want to pick, there's going

873
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.979
to be all kinds of things that, that are

874
00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:11.330
lost related to the environments of these different places

875
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.189
related to the cultural context. That doesn't mean you

876
00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:16.870
can't translate it all of course, people do it.

877
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:20.219
But it means that there, the idea of perfect

878
00:44:20.229 --> 00:44:22.510
translation may be a myth at least when you're

879
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.149
going between certain languages.

880
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.040
So I have perhaps two more questions here. One

881
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:32.350
of them, since your book is basically about linguistic

882
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:37.830
diversity and how uh for example, social relationships or

883
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.050
our society is structured and the environment that we

884
00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.090
are exposed to influence our particular languages evolve. And

885
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:50.709
also how by using particular words, terms and languages,

886
00:44:50.719 --> 00:44:54.330
it also influences how we perceive the world in

887
00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.239
at least to a certain extent. What are your

888
00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:00.560
thoughts on the word hypothesis?

889
00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:05.179
Yeah. So Super War warf hypothesis is interesting in

890
00:45:05.189 --> 00:45:09.169
part because Super and Wharf never actually co-authored anything.

891
00:45:09.179 --> 00:45:11.229
It's not like they sat down that term always

892
00:45:11.239 --> 00:45:12.750
makes it seem like they sat down and wrote

893
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.989
some hypothesis out, you know, and like really work.

894
00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:17.929
But it was really um war's work um amongst

895
00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:21.310
the Hopi tribe in the in the United States

896
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.510
that, that gave this a lot of impetus and

897
00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.290
the idea is related to things like how they

898
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.669
talk about time and some of his suggestions haven't

899
00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:35.139
really, you know, stood the test of time. But

900
00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:38.489
I think that the general point that that is

901
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.010
sometimes referred to by superior war hypothesis may be

902
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.649
accurate in the sense that languages do impact cognitive

903
00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:49.629
processes, like linguistic diversity does impact cognitive processes, but

904
00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:53.790
these impacts can be pretty subtle. Um So I

905
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.000
think the way that it's commonly construed as is

906
00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:01.449
maybe off, right, like Super Wharf is sometimes taken

907
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.199
as, oh, like you speak a different language, you

908
00:46:05.209 --> 00:46:07.320
know, say you speak KPI, you really just don't

909
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.780
get the passing of time or anything. Like it's

910
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.959
just a totally different, you're living a more centered

911
00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:14.419
existence or something like that. And that was never

912
00:46:14.429 --> 00:46:17.000
what Super or Wharf meant in the first place.

913
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.729
Um So it's, it's kind of that the, the

914
00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:23.540
issue with that the the label Super Wharf is

915
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.479
that it's come to mean all these different things

916
00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:28.100
that I don't think even Wharf meant it to

917
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.439
mean, right? Um The, the the example that I

918
00:46:31.449 --> 00:46:33.520
start the book off with kind of tongue in

919
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.209
cheek is the words for Snow example, right? Where

920
00:46:36.219 --> 00:46:39.250
that's something that like is associated with the Super

921
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:44.100
Wharf hypothesis. But these, it, it it actually goes

922
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.330
back to the work of some other linguists. Even

923
00:46:46.729 --> 00:46:49.350
Franz Boas was the first one who really pointed

924
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.699
out like these different words for Snow and different

925
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:54.159
indigenous groups that they maybe had more. But he

926
00:46:54.169 --> 00:46:56.870
never said anything about there being hundreds of words

927
00:46:56.879 --> 00:46:59.500
for Snow and Eskimo or you know, like, and

928
00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.280
you can see the cycle of exaggeration that that

929
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.469
this claim is tied to like and some of

930
00:47:04.479 --> 00:47:05.939
it's in the media. So I think even at

931
00:47:05.949 --> 00:47:08.149
one point, the New York Times had some quote

932
00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:11.729
about there are hundreds of words for Snow and

933
00:47:12.189 --> 00:47:14.010
in Eskimo, which is just not true, it's just

934
00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.580
patently untrue. And so part of the issue with

935
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.969
the Super War warf hypothesis is that it has

936
00:47:18.979 --> 00:47:21.800
about a century's worth of baggage. Now that's been

937
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:24.639
carried through the media in different places and it's

938
00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.699
distorted, was maybe inaccurate in some places. But at

939
00:47:28.709 --> 00:47:30.469
the end of the day, a fairly reasonable points

940
00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:33.360
made by, by Wharf and then kind of distorted

941
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.530
them. And it took research in the nineties and

942
00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:39.199
in the last 30 years to address this topic

943
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.780
um in more subtle ways and actually get at

944
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.040
this idea of do different do linguistic disparities actually

945
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:50.489
impact human cognitive processes and, and, and the answer

946
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.729
is yes, although sometimes the answer is a subtle

947
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:54.989
one and sometimes the answer seems to be no,

948
00:47:55.199 --> 00:47:57.260
you know, we expect to find some difference but

949
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.379
you do some experimental tests and there don't really

950
00:47:59.389 --> 00:48:01.919
seem to be any differences across populations in terms

951
00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:03.989
of how they, they think about a given thing.

952
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.459
So that less exciting than like, oh, it determines

953
00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:11.040
how you think or no, it doesn't determine how

954
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:12.510
you think, you know, the answers are often in

955
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.870
the gray areas. I think.

956
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.719
So, one last question then, um since we've been

957
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:22.010
talking about the diversity of language, I would also

958
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.929
like to ask you if you have any idea

959
00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:30.429
if this is sort of representative or illustrative or

960
00:48:30.439 --> 00:48:35.979
one small example of a broader discussion that is

961
00:48:35.989 --> 00:48:39.459
sort of ongoing in psychology and cognitive science, I

962
00:48:39.469 --> 00:48:45.810
guess about the universality of our psychology more broadly

963
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.120
in terms of, if we really across all societies

964
00:48:50.129 --> 00:48:57.209
share the same uh information processing mechanisms or mechanisms

965
00:48:57.219 --> 00:48:59.270
or not, I mean, do, do you think that

966
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.850
this perhaps might play a role in that sort

967
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.929
of discussion or a and if so do you

968
00:49:05.939 --> 00:49:08.320
think that perhaps we uh we might also be

969
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:13.310
assuming at least in certain instances too much universality

970
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.649
when it comes to human cognition or not?

971
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.080
I think so, it depends on who you talk

972
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.560
to, right? So some people now assume less universality.

973
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.120
I have really close colleagues who are evolutionary psychologists

974
00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.479
and I actually find a lot of that work

975
00:49:27.489 --> 00:49:29.580
pretty stimulating. I don't agree with all of it,

976
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.780
but they're sort of interested in what are the,

977
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.979
what are the processes, the evolutionary processes that may

978
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.719
maybe gave humans certain biases to think about things

979
00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:42.149
in certain ways that would have presented selective advantages.

980
00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:45.449
That's a totally reasonable thing to think about. Um

981
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.810
On the other hand, you know, we only left

982
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.870
Africa in waves as a species like 100,000 years

983
00:49:51.879 --> 00:49:54.429
ago. That's not a lot of time, right? In

984
00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:58.590
terms of so those kinds of pressures are probably

985
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.379
applied to all cultures, right? Like I, I would

986
00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:04.270
guess I would guess that there's not a lot

987
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.629
that's hardwired about us that's different. Um But that

988
00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:11.459
doesn't mean that it's universally, that universality is the

989
00:50:11.469 --> 00:50:14.709
answer, right? Because the main thing, it seems to

990
00:50:14.719 --> 00:50:17.459
me reading into some of these fields is that

991
00:50:17.709 --> 00:50:21.800
the the overarching theme is that uh cortical plasticity,

992
00:50:21.909 --> 00:50:25.469
right? We're just this like incredibly adaptive species and

993
00:50:25.479 --> 00:50:27.360
we do seem to do things that are kind

994
00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:31.199
of unique, like pay attention to the intentions of

995
00:50:31.209 --> 00:50:33.489
other members of our species and we're clearly more

996
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.409
social. Um But so the answer is just like

997
00:50:37.419 --> 00:50:40.270
sort of this clear plasticity, which allows for a

998
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.850
lot of variability across groups in terms of how

999
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.010
we problem solve. And in terms of how we,

1000
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.739
how we see the world in some ways. But

1001
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:49.300
that I guess my point is that I don't

1002
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.330
think that that's necessarily hardwired in us. I think

1003
00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.780
what's hardwired is this sort of a general flexibility

1004
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.909
of cognition um which allows us to confront all

1005
00:50:58.919 --> 00:51:02.080
sorts of challenges in unique ways and then maybe

1006
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.360
those are affected by culture and language over time

1007
00:51:05.449 --> 00:51:07.760
so that you get very different ways of addressing

1008
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.899
certain problems in the world around us based on

1009
00:51:10.909 --> 00:51:13.820
the cultural and linguistic lineage that you're familiar with.

1010
00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.080
Yes, because even though perhaps there's no been enough

1011
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.540
time since we left Africa for us to be

1012
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.419
to have acquired, let's say new cognitive adaptations through

1013
00:51:26.429 --> 00:51:31.179
genetic evolution, we also have cultural evolution, for example.

1014
00:51:31.189 --> 00:51:33.709
Right. Yes, exactly. And that's ultimately a lot of

1015
00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:36.929
this book is indirectly about cultural evolution, right? Like

1016
00:51:36.939 --> 00:51:41.139
things people adapt to different places and sometimes it's

1017
00:51:41.149 --> 00:51:43.820
actually clearly an adaptive process. Sometimes it's just a

1018
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.780
matter of, like I said, it's more an analogous

1019
00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.500
to genetic drift where there's lots of different cultures,

1020
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.590
people doing different things, some things are going to

1021
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.239
succeed in some environments, some things are just going

1022
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.860
to be different just because they're different. But we

1023
00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.250
can clearly change a lot over a short amount

1024
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.100
of time. Right. And so I don't want to

1025
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.100
trivialize that point. So like if you take something

1026
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:09.300
like literacy, writing has only been around about 5000

1027
00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:12.219
years, that's like nothing in terms of our trajectory

1028
00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.820
as a species. And until the last couple 100

1029
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:17.719
years and really the last 100 years, the vast

1030
00:52:17.729 --> 00:52:19.830
majority of people even in the West were, were

1031
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.520
not literate, right? And so, and there's plenty of

1032
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.469
research showing that learning how to read and write

1033
00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:27.439
and learning math at an early age has certain

1034
00:52:27.449 --> 00:52:31.879
neural cognitive effects um that that you can detect

1035
00:52:31.889 --> 00:52:34.030
in lots of different ways. And so these are

1036
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.820
profound, these can be profound effects that sort of

1037
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.600
differences cross culturally. So even if we start off

1038
00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.590
with a general sort of plasticity that we all

1039
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.580
share, that doesn't mean that the effects are trivial,

1040
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.959
right? Cross culturally

1041
00:52:47.919 --> 00:52:50.850
great. So the book is again, a myriad of

1042
00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.780
tongues, our languages reveal differences in how we think

1043
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.780
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1044
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:59.860
box of the interview. And Dr Everett just before

1045
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.239
we go apart from the book, we would like

1046
00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:04.780
to tell people where they can find your work

1047
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.699
on the internet.

1048
00:53:07.429 --> 00:53:10.050
Oh, yeah, working. So my previous book is um

1049
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.909
Numbers in the making of us. So if you

1050
00:53:11.919 --> 00:53:13.679
just Google that you can find that also and

1051
00:53:13.689 --> 00:53:17.409
it addresses similar concept of human diversity, but with

1052
00:53:17.419 --> 00:53:20.370
respect to number systems and how they evolved, I

1053
00:53:20.379 --> 00:53:23.649
have another book but it's more sort of academic

1054
00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:26.070
in nature. So maybe less interesting of a read.

1055
00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.590
Um But yeah, Google, my name and the research

1056
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.649
and, and, and you, and you'll find it. But

1057
00:53:31.659 --> 00:53:33.270
um yeah, I'm excited about this book and it

1058
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.800
was great to talk to you about it. Ricardo,

1059
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:36.199
