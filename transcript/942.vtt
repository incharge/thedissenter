00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.619
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.529
today I'm joined by Doctor Fernando Freya. She is

4
00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.760
distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of California

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.939
Davis. Her area of research is psycholinguistics. She uses

6
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.870
basic insights from formal linguistic, special theories in sentence

7
00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.840
phonology and syntax to develop models of processing. And

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.770
today we're talking about modifiers, speech disfluencies, misinterpretations and

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.529
how people deal with them, the study of reading

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.630
and information processing through wide tracking and some other

11
00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.569
related topics. So, Doctor Ferreira, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.990
It's a big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.840
Thank you very much. It's really great to be

14
00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.380
here. Thanks for the invitation.

15
00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:53.110
Great. So perhaps to introduce people to the topics

16
00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.439
we're going to explore here and also to you

17
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.099
a little bit more. Could you please start by

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.080
telling us about the kind of work you specifically

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.870
do the questions from linguistics you are most interested

20
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.550
in and how you got into it?

21
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.120
Ok. Um I guess I'll start at the highest

22
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.300
sort of at a high level of, of um

23
00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:20.949
generalization. I'm interested in language. I've always been interested

24
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.449
in how language works. And I began to be

25
00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.610
interested in the question of how humans process language.

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.930
When I was an undergraduate, um I became fascinated

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.830
by questions of uh you know, human nature and

28
00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:44.870
what made humans unique. What are the, what are

29
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:48.099
the, what is it, the balance between nature and

30
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.879
nurture and those sorts of questions? And in the

31
00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.129
course of pursuing those, those topics, I ended up

32
00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.790
taking classes in philosophy of mind and epistemology as

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.110
well as classes in psychology of course. And I

34
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.150
never actually took a class in linguistics when I

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.220
was an undergraduate because we didn't really have a

36
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.759
linguistics program. But through some of these other courses,

37
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.619
I began to realize that there was this area

38
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.369
of research this that looked at language processing from

39
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.899
a science from or looked at language from a

40
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.429
kind of a computational and biological point of view.

41
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.619
And then with psycholinguistics, I discovered an area where

42
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.509
people were looking at questions from a processing computational

43
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.779
psychological view and trying to understand how the language

44
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.289
system worked together with other cognitive systems, like memory

45
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.479
and uh decision making and attention and how all

46
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.440
those cognitive systems that are not specifically dedicated to

47
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:55.634
language combined with language systems to enable us to

48
00:02:55.645 --> 00:03:00.205
speak and to understand each other. So uh in

49
00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:04.274
my own research, I focused on questions like how

50
00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:08.675
we use the grammar of our language to in

51
00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:15.115
real time to process sentences. So, uh for example,

52
00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.929
we know that in English, uh we tend to

53
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.470
place our modifiers of nouns um before the noun.

54
00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.889
Whereas in Portuguese, they, they come after the noun.

55
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.949
And so this is um the kind of information

56
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.500
that a listener can use online to anticipate what

57
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.279
sort of word type is likely to be coming

58
00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.449
up next. And in production, it's information that would

59
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.169
be we would be using to constrain the form

60
00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.460
of our, of our sentences. So um I guess

61
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.729
then my general approach to studying language has been

62
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.369
to use primarily behavioral methods and I trying to

63
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.619
understand how people generate linguistic representations in real time

64
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.529
and how the language system works cooperatively with other

65
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.830
cognitive systems to allow these representations to get generated,

66
00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.300
whether it's in comprehension or in production.

67
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.548
Mhm. So let's get into some more specific questions.

68
00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.450
Uh I would also want to ask you uh

69
00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.179
some of the methods you use in your research,

70
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.619
but perhaps it's easier to get into some of

71
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.420
the topics and then we'll, we can go through

72
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.420
some of the methods as we talk about them.

73
00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:37.170
So uh you are interested, for example, in uncovering

74
00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:40.859
the mechanisms that enable humans to understand and generate

75
00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:44.269
language in real time and in cooper operation with

76
00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.640
other cognitive systems. So what are these uh mechanisms

77
00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:52.940
and how do you approach these kinds of questions?

78
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.369
Um Well, so one kind of mechanism that people

79
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.220
use when they are um trying to understand language

80
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.109
is that they uh there's a, so there's a

81
00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:11.799
term we use in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. We

82
00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.779
refer to the parser and the parser is the

83
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.079
component of the language system that takes this continuous

84
00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.005
stream of input, whether it's auditory or signed or

85
00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:29.325
visual um in the visual modality and breaks it

86
00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:35.045
up into pieces like words and grammatical phrases and

87
00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:40.285
uses those phrases to obtain uh an understanding of

88
00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:43.845
what a sentence might mean. And so uh the

89
00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:47.000
parser in order to do this is going to

90
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.320
consult grammatical information. So information about the rules of

91
00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:55.570
the language that allow words to be put together

92
00:05:55.609 --> 00:05:58.920
and possibly um in some languages, at least rules

93
00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:03.299
about things like um agreement like grammatical agreement. So

94
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.859
in English, we don't have a lot of it,

95
00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.769
but like in Portuguese, for example, we have um

96
00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.570
gender agreement and that kind of information can help

97
00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:15.220
the processor figure out how to chunk this continuous

98
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.100
stream of sound or of squiggles on a computer

99
00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:24.149
screen into discrete units like words and phrases and

100
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.579
so on. And so in the research, I've looked

101
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.450
at the question of how this grammatical knowledge is

102
00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.859
consulted in real time and what the language processing

103
00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:37.690
system does when it's faced with more than one

104
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.029
possible interpretation that it could draw of a constituent.

105
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.290
Um BECAUSE there's a lot of ambiguity in language,

106
00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:49.350
there's a lot of situations or, or the parser

107
00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:52.700
will often find itself confronted with input that can

108
00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:57.190
receive more than one grammatical analysis. Um Things like

109
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.570
um I si saw the, I saw the boy,

110
00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:02.940
I saw the boy with the binoculars, you know,

111
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.779
in that sentence. Um There are two possible grammatical

112
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.820
analysis. You used binoculars to see the boy or

113
00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.959
you saw a boy who had, who had binoculars

114
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.179
on him, on his person in some way. And

115
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.779
so the question is, you know, which of how

116
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.579
does the processing system decide which interpretation to get?

117
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.450
And a lot of my work has been centered

118
00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.929
around questions like that where we focus on information

119
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.450
sources like, well, maybe the system tries to compute

120
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:36.329
the simplest analysis. And if that simple analysis is

121
00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.769
not sufficient or gets blocked in some way, then

122
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:42.690
the system has to construct an alternate, then it

123
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.049
goes to it to the more difficult analysis. But

124
00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:49.279
the default is to construct a simple analysis. Um

125
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.750
OR maybe the system looks at the context and

126
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.769
says, well, uh in a situation like this, it's

127
00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:59.489
very likely that somebody would be using binoculars as

128
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.989
an instrument. And therefore I'm going to compute that

129
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.670
analysis. Um MAYBE pros plays a role. So the

130
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:08.239
way that the sentence is pronounced. So if I

131
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.972
say um I saw the boy with binoculars, um

132
00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:16.583
I might be sort of indicating that actually, as

133
00:08:16.592 --> 00:08:17.893
I say that I don't know which one would

134
00:08:17.903 --> 00:08:19.942
be more likely. But there are claims in the

135
00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:22.953
literature that one way of saying it versus another

136
00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:26.252
way will push you in one towards one analysis

137
00:08:26.263 --> 00:08:29.186
or another. So in my research, we, we have

138
00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:33.705
tried to understand these questions using methods like um

139
00:08:33.716 --> 00:08:37.416
anything from acceptability judgments which are very cheap and

140
00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:40.575
easy to get all the way to um things

141
00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.035
like eye tracking. And we have done some F

142
00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:46.375
MRI and er P research as well. Although cognitive

143
00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:48.895
neuroscience is not my core area of research,

144
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.299
uh we will come back to eye tracking and

145
00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:56.530
also to how people deal with, as you said,

146
00:08:56.539 --> 00:09:00.659
their, the ambiguities of language. But now, uh I

147
00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:04.169
have another uh uh aspect of your work that

148
00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:06.780
I would like to explore here. So you've also

149
00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:11.200
done some work on how the position of modifiers

150
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.770
in English specifically influences how words are encoded and,

151
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.679
and later on retrieved from memory. So, uh how

152
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.270
does that occur? And is there a difference between

153
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.090
how people in code and process pre modifiers versus

154
00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:33.809
post modifiers? And, and by the way, what are

155
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.900
modifiers to begin with?

156
00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:40.710
Ok. So um I'm actually looking at a presentation

157
00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:42.479
that I gave on this topic just to help

158
00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:46.119
me remember some details. And then a very important

159
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.059
um to begin with is that the work on

160
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.140
pre nominal versus post nominal modifiers that I've done

161
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.280
is entirely led by my former graduate student Hussein

162
00:09:57.289 --> 00:10:00.950
Karimi and Hussein is now at Mississippi State University.

163
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.960
Um When he worked with me, he was really

164
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:08.090
interested in this question of how modifiers influence our

165
00:10:08.099 --> 00:10:14.179
interpretations of language. And so he partly came to

166
00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:16.830
Davis to work with me because he wanted to

167
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.890
explore this topic with me. But I need to

168
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.590
give credit to Hussein that this research was um

169
00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:25.489
designed by him, led by him. Um He's the

170
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.520
one who kind of formulated the specific research questions

171
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.840
that we would ask, but that we asked, but

172
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:34.299
he started from work that I had done before.

173
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.760
I got to know him probably when he was

174
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.609
still a little boy or maybe not even born

175
00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:40.940
yet work that I had done with my partner

176
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:46.739
John Henderson, where we looked at the um interpretation

177
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.900
of garden path sentences. So these garden path sentences

178
00:10:49.909 --> 00:10:53.049
are sentences that have an, an a syntactic ambiguity

179
00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:56.109
in them and they're called garden path because you

180
00:10:56.119 --> 00:10:58.630
tend to go one way in your interpretation of

181
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.789
the ambiguity and the subsequent material in the sentence

182
00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.695
contradicts that analysis and forces you to have to

183
00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.825
go the other way with the sentence. And the

184
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:11.054
classic example is the horse raced past the barn

185
00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:14.405
fell which everybody hates and it doesn't really make

186
00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:16.354
a lot of sense, but it does have a

187
00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:19.924
legitimate analysis. The horse that was raced past the

188
00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:23.590
barn fell, that's what the sentence actually means. And

189
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.780
in English, we can delete some of those optional

190
00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:28.640
function words. So when people get the horse race

191
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.080
past the barn, they think they're done they think

192
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.719
they have a complete active clause and then they

193
00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:36.000
get this verb fell and it's like, what am

194
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.780
I supposed to do with this? I can't figure

195
00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:39.830
out where this is supposed to go. And so

196
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.739
they have, and so they struggle and they finally

197
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.940
reanalyze the sentence. Um IN the work that I

198
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.500
did with John Henderson, we looked at sentences like

199
00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:53.590
uh while Mary bathed the baby played and in

200
00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:57.059
a sentence like that uh if you get while

201
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.239
Mary bathed the baby, you or would be tempted

202
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.429
to treat that as a chunk that Mary's bathing

203
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.460
the baby. So you get while Mary bathes the

204
00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:07.280
baby and then you get a word like played

205
00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:09.559
and you're you've been led down the garden path,

206
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.159
it turns out the baby is playing and Mary's

207
00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:16.289
bathing herself. And so in that work, John, in

208
00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:18.059
the work that I did with John, we showed

209
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.409
that if you take that phrase while Mary ba

210
00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:24.469
the baby plate, if you take the baby and

211
00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:27.599
you lengthen it with modifiers, so you have the

212
00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:30.979
baby that was cute and cuddly. So the full

213
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:33.750
sentences while Mary bathes the baby, that was cute

214
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.820
and cuddly played, you really make the garden path

215
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.799
more severe. The garden path becomes far more uh

216
00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:45.340
hard, it becomes far harder to recover from. And

217
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.309
yet we show that if you have a sentence

218
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.369
like while Mary bathed the cute and cuddly baby

219
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.729
played, that's not harder than just the baby. So

220
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.219
the core idea here is that we've got a

221
00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:01.429
noun phrase the baby and it can be modified

222
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.520
with something like cute and cuddly like all babies

223
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.030
are cute and cuddly, right? So it can, and

224
00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:09.510
in English, we can either say the cute and

225
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.789
cuddly baby or we can say the baby that's

226
00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:16.210
cute and cuddly. And that's the pre nominal versus

227
00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:19.169
post nominal distinction. We can either put the adjectives

228
00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:21.989
before the noun which is kind of the default

229
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.719
or we can put them after the noun. And

230
00:13:24.729 --> 00:13:26.489
so what this work that I did with John

231
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.979
Henderson showed a long time ago is that if

232
00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:31.820
you put the modifiers after the noun, you make

233
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.559
the garden path more severe. So Hussein Karimi came

234
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.030
to me in the mid two thousands to work.

235
00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.960
Uh uh ACTUALLY after 2010 to work with me

236
00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:48.349
on this to pursue this issue further where he

237
00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:51.590
wanted to look at the possibility that modified nouns

238
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:54.780
in general are richer and that we remember them

239
00:13:54.789 --> 00:13:58.500
better. So if you have a sentence, like I

240
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.960
saw the cute and cuddly baby versus just I

241
00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:07.479
saw the baby cute and cuddly adds information that

242
00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:12.539
makes the concept of baby more memorable. And, and

243
00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:15.440
so we started out with doing some experiments where

244
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.130
we showed exactly that, that any noun in a

245
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.739
sentence that's modified will tend to be remembered better

246
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.989
than a noun that isn't modified. So that just

247
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.919
kind of established this enhanced um memorability of any

248
00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:33.609
noun in a sentence that has received a modifier.

249
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.690
Um Let me know if I'm going on too

250
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.159
much or is this? OK.

251
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:39.359
No, no, no, no, that's perfectly fine.

252
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.090
Yeah. OK. So, so having shown that a noun

253
00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:47.070
in a sentence that has been modified is has

254
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.239
a richer representation in memory. Um Hussein then wanted

255
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.070
to know whether it matters if it's, I saw

256
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.309
the cute and cuddly baby or I saw the

257
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.159
baby that's cute and cuddly. In other words, is

258
00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:05.250
we already know that modification makes the noun richer.

259
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.250
But is there a difference in how rich it

260
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.979
becomes with modification? Depending on whether the modifiers are

261
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:15.000
pre nominal, that is they occur before the noun

262
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.859
or post nominal, they occur after the noun. And

263
00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:22.090
so we did a series of experiments where we

264
00:15:22.099 --> 00:15:28.229
showed that if you give people sentence with something

265
00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:33.679
like uh the dog chased the angry cat, people

266
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.700
are more likely to continue to, to write a

267
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.849
follow up sentence that is about the cat than

268
00:15:39.859 --> 00:15:42.780
about the dog. And we show that that effect

269
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:47.359
is even greater if the modifier is after cat

270
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:51.510
rather than before the cat. And in um other

271
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.289
work, um Let me just consult this present this

272
00:15:55.409 --> 00:15:57.659
uh summary that I have here just to make

273
00:15:57.669 --> 00:16:03.159
sure I don't get anything wrong. Um Right. And

274
00:16:03.169 --> 00:16:06.580
um the information and a noun phrase is read

275
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.989
faster when it's when it has post nominal modifiers

276
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.719
and what has pre nominal modifiers. So, in general,

277
00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:17.479
what this seems to suggest is that when you

278
00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:20.840
have a, when you have a phrase and you're

279
00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:24.150
trying to interpret it as a listener or reader,

280
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.429
you get something like the, and then the best

281
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.210
thing is to get the noun next because the

282
00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:37.380
noun is the the boss of the phrase. So

283
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.330
the cute and c if I'm saying in English,

284
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.590
the cute and cuddly, you know, your processing system

285
00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:44.530
is in a state of limbo of like the

286
00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:48.599
cute and cuddly. What um if you say the

287
00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:52.330
baby that's OK. Now you, you, you have been

288
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.140
told what is the entity that's at issue here

289
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.469
and then you get the modifier and you can

290
00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:01.539
kind of conveniently attach that modification to something that

291
00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:04.420
you already have a token in your mental representation

292
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:09.540
for. So our um work suggests then that the

293
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.969
head of the phrase is the boss and is

294
00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:17.108
the thing that you're processing is centered around. And

295
00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:20.209
so this leads to some really interesting questions like

296
00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:22.449
why does English work the way it does? And

297
00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.939
why in general are there any languages where the

298
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:30.069
the head occurs after its constituent after its arguments

299
00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:34.040
or after its modifiers? So English is a language

300
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:39.369
that is um generally heads occur first, but noun

301
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.689
phrases are the one place where we actually post

302
00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:45.270
can postpone the head. And what we show is

303
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.469
that, that actually leads to processing costs. So, um

304
00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:53.150
really it would be better if languages worked. So

305
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.270
that heads always occurred first and consist recently occurred

306
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.199
first. Um But of course, there probably are other

307
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:04.689
tradeoffs that are making head initial languages not necessarily

308
00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:08.400
more efficient than head final languages. Um But at

309
00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.290
any rate, that's kind of the, that's kind of

310
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.540
the story about head initial versus uh well about

311
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.699
pre nominal versus post nominal modification.

312
00:18:18.189 --> 00:18:20.300
So another topic I would like to ask you

313
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.369
about is speech disfluency. So, first of all, what

314
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.810
are speech disfluencies? And uh if I got this

315
00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:32.650
correctly, I got from your work and your of

316
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.449
the work of other people that there are four

317
00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:39.989
different types of disfluency filled puzzles like mm and

318
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.010
uh and stuff like that. Unfilled puzzles, repetitions and

319
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.810
repair. So, could you tell us about that?

320
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.910
Um Sure. So no doubt in this um uh

321
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.339
video, you've already heard a lot of examples of

322
00:18:55.349 --> 00:19:01.050
disfluencies. Um BECAUSE of all of us use disfluencies

323
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.469
and, and uh display disfluencies when we're speaking. Uh

324
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:10.719
The idea is that, um see, there we go,

325
00:19:10.729 --> 00:19:13.300
there is a disfluency right there. Um Yeah, you

326
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.099
basically laid out the, the types of disfluencies that

327
00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:19.489
are out there there. The first three, the filled

328
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.880
pauses, unfilled pauses and repeats are kind of um

329
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.729
tactics for buying time. And then the repairs are

330
00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:29.800
the kind of disc fluency that we have to

331
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.040
invoke when we didn't quite plan as effectively as

332
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.119
we could have. And we've made a mistake and

333
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.520
we need to correct it. We could actually even

334
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.439
talk about another kind of disfluency, which we could

335
00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:44.680
maybe refer to as an undetected error where we

336
00:19:44.689 --> 00:19:48.790
say something incorrect. And our interlocutor might say, put

337
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.400
the milk in the, put the milk in the

338
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.942
stove, you mean the fridge, right? And you say,

339
00:19:52.953 --> 00:19:54.312
oh yeah, yeah. You know, you know what I

340
00:19:54.322 --> 00:19:58.682
mean kind of thing. Um So uh disfluencies are

341
00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:03.052
really fascinating because they are a really great example

342
00:20:03.062 --> 00:20:06.703
of the way that we have this, these linguistic

343
00:20:06.713 --> 00:20:09.892
representations. We have these grammars that we can consult,

344
00:20:09.922 --> 00:20:13.223
that enable us to produce and understand sentences. But

345
00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:16.365
when we're applying them in real time, we we

346
00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:21.326
often find ourselves not able to retrieve the information

347
00:20:21.336 --> 00:20:23.745
that we need as quickly as we would like

348
00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:27.156
to, to maintain full fluency. So there might be

349
00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:29.895
a word that's uh that's rare or that's escaping

350
00:20:29.906 --> 00:20:32.615
us or I can't quite remember your name. So

351
00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:35.855
I put in an ah or I pause um

352
00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:38.485
or I just say the the, you know, the

353
00:20:38.495 --> 00:20:42.670
the as a way of getting extra time. So,

354
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.660
disfluencies um um that uh where disfluencies tend to

355
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:52.439
occur can give us some insights into what kinds

356
00:20:52.449 --> 00:20:57.469
of constituents or other or words or phrases are

357
00:20:57.479 --> 00:21:00.640
hard for the linguistic system to retrieve or from

358
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.640
the memory system to retrieve. And in work I

359
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:07.699
did recently with my graduate students. Um uh Nora

360
00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:11.300
Beer and Nae Chanta Von. Um BOTH of whom

361
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.310
are now now have their phd S and have

362
00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:16.550
moved on. We actually try to look at the

363
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.099
question of whether people as they become older, become

364
00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:25.189
more disfluent. So o older adults are thought to

365
00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:28.890
become more our impression is that they become more

366
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.089
disfluent as they age, they say um and uh

367
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.050
and they pause more than younger people do. Um

368
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.829
But the evidence on this point has been really

369
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.609
mixed in the literature. And as you can imagine,

370
00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:45.810
it's pretty hard to study how disfluencies change with

371
00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:48.469
age because what you really want to do is

372
00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:51.410
follow somebody longitudinally. You want to start with someone

373
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.530
in their twenties, record how many disfluencies they produce,

374
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.910
then record them in their thirties and then they're

375
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.810
in their forties and then in their seventies and

376
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:01.060
eighties, of course, no one's gonna live long enough

377
00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:04.160
to do that to do that study. So it's

378
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.670
really a tough question to address. So most of

379
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.650
the work that's being done is what we call

380
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.829
cross sectional, which means you compare some young people

381
00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:14.500
count how many disciplines they produce and some old

382
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.989
people. But that introduces all kinds of confounds. It's

383
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.069
not the most powerful way to get at the

384
00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:23.869
question. So in this study, what we did, um

385
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.599
and it was inspired actually by um uh uh

386
00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.099
an incident where I was listening to a news

387
00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:34.280
to the news and they were interviewing our former

388
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.915
governor of California. Jerry Brown, who was Governor of

389
00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:42.405
California fairly recently. And he was also governor of

390
00:22:42.415 --> 00:22:46.255
California in the 19 seventies. And I listened to

391
00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:49.305
him in the current times. I was struck by

392
00:22:49.314 --> 00:22:52.145
how disfluent he was, not that he was super

393
00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:55.425
disfluent, but I remember in the seventies he was

394
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:59.099
just smooth, you know, you just seem to make

395
00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:01.959
no mistakes at all. He's talked the way people

396
00:23:01.969 --> 00:23:04.199
could, you know, would read a speech or something.

397
00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.410
And I thought jeez, you know, this would be

398
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.339
a really cool way to look at this question

399
00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:12.599
longitudinally is to go on youtube and find videos

400
00:23:12.609 --> 00:23:16.130
of people being interviewed at multiple times in their

401
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.672
lives, you know, take somebody like uh Jerry Brown,

402
00:23:19.682 --> 00:23:22.633
they're very well. There are recordings of him being

403
00:23:22.642 --> 00:23:25.353
interviewed at different stages of his life. So what

404
00:23:25.363 --> 00:23:30.152
we did was to collect youtube videos of people

405
00:23:30.162 --> 00:23:34.942
like Oprah Winfrey, David Bowie, Jerry Brown, you know,

406
00:23:34.953 --> 00:23:38.603
all kinds of people who by necessity are famous

407
00:23:38.802 --> 00:23:41.956
because most people who will be interested multiple times

408
00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:44.245
over their lives and you on you and who's

409
00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:46.105
would then be up on youtube would tend to

410
00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:48.225
have a little bit of, of fame associated with

411
00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:51.426
them. And we counted the the disfluencies in their

412
00:23:51.436 --> 00:23:54.855
speech at the different times of their lives. And

413
00:23:54.865 --> 00:23:57.265
what we discovered is that actually people do not

414
00:23:57.276 --> 00:24:01.276
become more disfluent as they age. Um Contrary to

415
00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:05.390
what anyone would have expected. What we did observe

416
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.609
is that older adults have what's called enhanced lexical

417
00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:13.290
diversity. Meaning that if you look at the set

418
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.930
of words that people produce as they get older,

419
00:24:16.069 --> 00:24:20.550
they come from, they display richer vocabulary. So older

420
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.030
people have access to more words and we know

421
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.930
this from lots and lots of, of research on

422
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:29.666
aging. There's one thing that happens to you with

423
00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.286
increasing age, that's good is that, you know, more

424
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:34.916
and more words. Um But as you know, more

425
00:24:34.926 --> 00:24:37.485
and more words, they do get harder and harder

426
00:24:37.495 --> 00:24:40.316
to retrieve because it's sort of like rummaging in

427
00:24:40.326 --> 00:24:43.336
a drawer that's full of stuff and the more

428
00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:45.645
stuff that's in there, the harder it can be

429
00:24:45.656 --> 00:24:49.586
to find the exact thing that you want. And

430
00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:52.962
so the slight tendency for more dis fluency that

431
00:24:52.972 --> 00:24:55.802
we did observe in older adults could be pretty

432
00:24:55.812 --> 00:24:59.621
much entirely explained in terms of their wish to

433
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:01.991
retrieve a word that was a little bit more

434
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:05.842
precise, a little bit less frequent that um was

435
00:25:05.852 --> 00:25:08.641
there probably a little bit hard to retrieve and

436
00:25:08.651 --> 00:25:10.432
they needed a little bit of extra time in

437
00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:12.722
order to pull it out of their um mental

438
00:25:12.732 --> 00:25:16.020
dictionary or lexicon? Um So sorry, that's like a

439
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.280
very long winded description. But it tells us that

440
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.599
we can look at questions like um how do

441
00:25:22.609 --> 00:25:25.060
people age? What happens to the language system with

442
00:25:25.069 --> 00:25:28.319
the age? What's the relationship between memory and language

443
00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:33.329
uh by examining something as simple as just people's

444
00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:36.469
speech and counting up how many uh and ums

445
00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:41.000
and repairs they produce in that speech. So that's

446
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.660
all on the language production end. Um I haven't

447
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.959
talked about language comprehension and fluency. So I'll just

448
00:25:47.969 --> 00:25:50.050
tell you really briefly that the question that we

449
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.500
can ask. And uh is it OK. Do you

450
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.660
want me to continue with it?

451
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.140
Yes. Yes. And then, uh we'll also have some

452
00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.439
follow up questions to all of what you're saying

453
00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:02.219
there. But yes, please go ahead.

454
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.619
OK. So the thing with disfluencies and comprehension is

455
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.880
that when I um um um when I'm doing

456
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.839
that you as a listener are kind of on

457
00:26:14.849 --> 00:26:19.199
hold, you're waiting, your, so your parser, your language

458
00:26:19.209 --> 00:26:22.729
processing system that's been engaged is now in a

459
00:26:22.739 --> 00:26:27.300
state of being on hold waiting for the speaker

460
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.170
to kind of resume the, the processing. Um Similarly,

461
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.839
if I produce a mistake and then have to

462
00:26:35.849 --> 00:26:39.430
engage in a repair, you, you as the comprehend,

463
00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:45.430
have to invoke probably inhibition mechanisms that delete the

464
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:48.359
word that I said and replace it with the

465
00:26:48.369 --> 00:26:51.030
word that I meant to say. So if I

466
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.979
say something like I did this research with Nora,

467
00:26:53.989 --> 00:26:58.380
I mean, with Hussein, you initially built a representation

468
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.969
where you understood me to be saying that I

469
00:27:00.979 --> 00:27:03.979
did this research with Nora. But if I then

470
00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:07.819
say no, I mean, Hussein, you need to strike

471
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:09.609
that from the record kind of like a jury

472
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:12.540
that's told by a judge, forget what you were

473
00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.140
just told, you need to remove that from your

474
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.930
mental representation and replace what I said with the

475
00:27:18.939 --> 00:27:22.010
correct word that I intended. And what we showed

476
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.890
in some really, um I think fun research that

477
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.640
I did with a former postdoc named Matthew Lauder

478
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.180
who's now at the University of Richmond. What Matt

479
00:27:30.189 --> 00:27:33.000
and I showed is that when people get something

480
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.119
like put the milk back in the stove, which

481
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.300
is going to be corrected because that's a very

482
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.920
common kind of speech error that people will make.

483
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:46.130
Um WHAT listeners do is they right away begin

484
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.400
to detect that you have made a mistake because

485
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.420
it's, it's not plausible to put milk in a

486
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.540
stove. And what we showed using something called a

487
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.880
visual world paradigm, which is about eye tracking, which

488
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.199
I guess is something we'll get to later is

489
00:28:01.209 --> 00:28:03.510
that if you show people pictures of things in

490
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.160
a kitchen, um and I say, put the casserole

491
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.270
in the stove, your eyes go to a picture

492
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.270
of a casserole, your eyes go to the image

493
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.569
of the stove. But if I say put the

494
00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:16.390
milk in the stove, your eyes will go to

495
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.410
the milk, but they don't even tend to go

496
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.780
to the stove. They go, you, you look directly

497
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:25.109
at the fridge as if your autocorrect brain mechanisms

498
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:29.599
as you're processing language are saying, forget stove, that's

499
00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:32.770
not what the person meant. That's a mistake. So

500
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.130
we process disfluencies really efficiently because we're, we're able

501
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.089
to use what some people in cognitive science refer

502
00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.550
to as our priors where a or you can

503
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.500
just think of it as world knowledge and plausibility

504
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.650
information which tells us that milk doesn't belong in

505
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.250
a stove, that stove and fridge or words that

506
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.650
people are likely to confuse with each other. And

507
00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.209
what you're trying to do as a listener is

508
00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:01.859
to uncover the communicative intention behind what the speaker

509
00:29:01.869 --> 00:29:04.890
is saying. You're not only using the literal world

510
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.310
words in order to do that. Um So that's

511
00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:11.869
another thing then we can learn from by studying

512
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.949
disfluencies this time in comprehension, we can get a

513
00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:18.829
really good window into the way that our brains

514
00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:23.829
autocorrect um and filling in mechanisms work. So it's

515
00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:26.089
not just our phones and our devices that are

516
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:30.050
good at um correcting our mistakes, but our brains

517
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.500
are good at doing that too.

518
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:37.040
Ok. So several questions about all of that. So

519
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.910
the first one is uh is it that every

520
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.579
time people use a field pause, an unfilled pause,

521
00:29:45.589 --> 00:29:50.380
a repetition or a repair, you classify it as

522
00:29:50.439 --> 00:29:53.040
a this fluency? I mean, I'm asking you that

523
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.630
because since it's so common that we use these

524
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.880
kinds of uh this fluent or have this, this

525
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.709
sort of this fluent behaviors while talking, I was

526
00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:13.939
wondering if it's always problematic. I mean, cognitively, for

527
00:30:13.949 --> 00:30:17.969
example, since you also mentioned there, uh comparing younger

528
00:30:17.979 --> 00:30:21.060
people to older people in terms of rates of

529
00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:24.060
this fluency and all of that, I was wondering

530
00:30:24.069 --> 00:30:26.810
if it would also be tied to perhaps some

531
00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:32.329
sort of uh cognitive issues, cognitive decline or something

532
00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:35.079
like that. So I I, is it always a

533
00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:41.079
cognitively problematic if we use these sorts of these

534
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:41.849
fluence?

535
00:30:43.489 --> 00:30:46.579
So I, that's a really interesting, that's a really

536
00:30:46.589 --> 00:30:50.849
important question. So in production, what we have shown

537
00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:52.599
in other work that I did, I did with

538
00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:55.469
a former colleague named Joel ***, who's an expert

539
00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:57.829
on ad DH D. We looked at in, at

540
00:30:57.839 --> 00:31:01.719
adults who had been diagnosed with, it had received

541
00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:03.959
an official diagnosis of A DH D when they

542
00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:09.069
were young and we compared them to demographically demographic

543
00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.985
control. So people who are same education level, roughly

544
00:31:12.995 --> 00:31:16.495
the same age, who had the same um income

545
00:31:16.505 --> 00:31:18.895
level and so on who had not ever received

546
00:31:18.906 --> 00:31:22.265
an A DH D diagnosis. And interestingly what we

547
00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:24.686
showed is that people with a DH D do

548
00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:28.355
not produce more disfluencies than people who had never

549
00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:31.215
been diagnosed with a DH D except for the

550
00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:35.556
repair type. So what that seems to suggest is

551
00:31:35.566 --> 00:31:39.041
that if you've had a DH, perhaps as you

552
00:31:39.052 --> 00:31:43.401
might expect, your inhibition, inhibition mechanisms aren't working quite

553
00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:46.112
as well or as efficiently as they might in

554
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:48.712
other people. And as a result, you'll say the

555
00:31:48.722 --> 00:31:51.401
wrong word a little bit more frequently than someone

556
00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:53.921
who's never had ad a DH D and have

557
00:31:53.932 --> 00:31:56.781
to make a repair. So, what this kind of

558
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:59.991
suggests is that us and, ums and pauses are

559
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:04.650
actually a good way to plan. Ok. So I

560
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.790
was talking about the, that in cases of a

561
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.699
DH D, uh, we can see that disfluencies are

562
00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:16.329
by comparing, uh, individuals who've had a DH D

563
00:32:16.339 --> 00:32:18.500
to those who haven't, we can get a picture

564
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.000
that tells us that pauses are an effective way

565
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.520
to buy time. And that in some ways, it's

566
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.829
not a matter of never being disfluent. It's kind

567
00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:29.660
of like picking your poison. Do you want to

568
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.880
be disfluent by carefully planning and pausing and saying

569
00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.459
us? And um so that you don't make a

570
00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:40.510
mistake or are you gonna wait more heavily, the

571
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.599
system operating so that you don't make any pauses?

572
00:32:43.609 --> 00:32:46.910
But, and that increases the likelihood of errors. So

573
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.349
it's not really a matter of ever. I don't

574
00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:53.609
think any mere mortal can ever be perfectly fluent.

575
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.160
And it just is a matter of whether you're

576
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.550
in a situation where you're going to wait precision

577
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.410
very carefully and therefore produce maybe more pauses or

578
00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.060
whether you're going to wait fluency more heavily and

579
00:33:08.069 --> 00:33:11.650
therefore increase the potential for making errors which will

580
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.670
necessitate a repair. Um That's on the production side,

581
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.790
on the comprehension side, it's super interesting to think

582
00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.020
about disfluencies as cues. And in fact, if we

583
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.050
go back to the work of the pioneers in

584
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.229
this field like Herb Clark and Tom Wo this

585
00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:32.430
is actually what they've argued that when people are

586
00:33:32.439 --> 00:33:38.050
um interpreting language, they use disfluencies as information. Um

587
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.819
For example, if I say the um cat like

588
00:33:42.829 --> 00:33:45.369
that's a little bit un unexpected because cats are

589
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.829
pretty easy word to retrieve. If I say the

590
00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:52.050
um feline like that is the um is a

591
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.199
little bit more expected because feline is a slightly

592
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.255
rarer word. So if you hear me produce an

593
00:33:58.265 --> 00:34:02.074
R and um perhaps you can get yourself prepped

594
00:34:02.084 --> 00:34:07.265
for a slightly less expected word or concept. And

595
00:34:07.275 --> 00:34:10.495
there's really cool research by people like Jennifer Arnold

596
00:34:10.504 --> 00:34:14.293
demonstrating that this is true that you can use

597
00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:18.849
disfluencies as cues that somebody is about to refer

598
00:34:18.858 --> 00:34:24.069
to something that's not, yes yet, maybe introduced or

599
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:26.438
has not been talked about for a little while.

600
00:34:26.447 --> 00:34:28.849
And in research I did with Carl Bailey, we

601
00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:32.719
showed that disfluencies can tell you that you're about

602
00:34:32.728 --> 00:34:36.040
to begin a new clause in a sentence because

603
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:40.149
we tend to produce um before the beginnings of

604
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.208
at the beginnings of clauses, nobody's just fluent at

605
00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.560
the end of the sentence. So nobody says John

606
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.639
went to the store um like that doesn't make

607
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:51.918
any sense, but we would say um John went

608
00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.340
to the store. So these disfluencies can be used

609
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:59.320
as information about what a speaker is likely to

610
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.739
say. So they help the listener get a head

611
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.919
start on what's about to happen. Plus there's one

612
00:35:04.929 --> 00:35:08.510
more function of disfluencies, I should say because we

613
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.639
now have disfluencies in written language as well. So

614
00:35:11.649 --> 00:35:15.229
if you uh especially in casual writing, like uh

615
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:20.310
social media or um in instant messaging or direct

616
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.100
messages to people will often in insert um or

617
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.820
an uh because we know that they actually convey

618
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.219
a little bit of meaning. If I say something

619
00:35:29.229 --> 00:35:33.189
like I heard about your um story, you know,

620
00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:36.729
that sort of is um I'm using um there

621
00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:41.070
as kind of a word to suggest skepticism about

622
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.040
your um uh that story is, you know, about

623
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.290
the concept of, of the story here. So uh

624
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.389
disfluencies have a, have a number of potentially useful

625
00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:54.189
functions.

626
00:35:54.979 --> 00:36:00.419
Mhm And with all of those disfluencies that we

627
00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:04.510
tend to have and sometimes misspoken words or using

628
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.370
even the incorrect words. And uh all of that,

629
00:36:08.379 --> 00:36:14.770
how of how, how often do comprehend misinterpret language

630
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.209
actually? Does, does it occur often or not? And

631
00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:21.139
with all of course, with all the ambiguity surrounding

632
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:22.489
language and all of that,

633
00:36:24.459 --> 00:36:27.989
that's I'll give you two answers to that question.

634
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.370
One is we can't really know and the other

635
00:36:31.379 --> 00:36:35.600
is that based on what we know, probably less

636
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:40.510
often than we might worry, we misinterpret each other.

637
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.800
So, on the one hand, it's very hard to

638
00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.239
know how often we misinterpret each other because misinterpretations

639
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.750
are private, I can't tell by just sort of

640
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.489
looking at you, right. Now, to what extent you

641
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.419
are understanding each and every word that I've said

642
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.000
because I don't have access to your mental states.

643
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.520
And we know that uh well, you know, before

644
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.479
this interview started, we, we talked a little bit

645
00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:12.879
about speaking Portuguese. And um you know, I can

646
00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:16.120
understand Portuguese far, far more easily than I can

647
00:37:16.129 --> 00:37:19.530
speak it because I can piece things together. I

648
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.760
can use context and comprehension and I can fake

649
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.389
it. I can pretend that I'm understanding and then

650
00:37:25.399 --> 00:37:29.850
hope that something the person says uh subsequently clarifies

651
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.360
the word that I don't actually know. And I

652
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.050
don't want to admit that I don't know it.

653
00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.830
So I'm pretending. Um So we really need to

654
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:42.050
do experiments in order to get at misinterpretations. And

655
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.629
what experiments like the ones we've done in my

656
00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:48.340
lab with people like Kyle Christiansen, for example, have

657
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:53.300
shown is that indeed people can be quite bad

658
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.524
at understanding language. They misinterpret the syntactic structure. They

659
00:37:57.534 --> 00:38:00.965
even get, get the words in the sentence wrong.

660
00:38:01.054 --> 00:38:03.885
We've shown that people interpret a sentence like the

661
00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:06.294
dog was bitten by the man to mean that

662
00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:08.844
the dog bit the man because it's much more

663
00:38:08.854 --> 00:38:12.284
likely that a dog would bite a human than

664
00:38:12.294 --> 00:38:16.750
the other way around. Um And so there, and

665
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.510
we know from really interesting work going back to

666
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.000
the seventies that Lynn reader, for example, did on

667
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.629
the, what's the, the so called Moses illusion? Um

668
00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:28.830
Where if I ask you how many of each

669
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.530
kind of animal did Moses take on the Ark?

670
00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.560
A lot of people will just say, 02. Um

671
00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.239
But what they really should say is uh you

672
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.750
mean Noah, not Moses because that um you know

673
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.840
the way the story goes, it was Noah and

674
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.149
not Moses. So the Moses illusion reveals that people

675
00:38:47.229 --> 00:38:52.939
often will, we will not understand the language correctly.

676
00:38:52.949 --> 00:38:57.870
And these autocorrect mechanisms are so robust that sometimes

677
00:38:57.879 --> 00:39:00.489
they work in such a way that they're fixing

678
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.669
the input for us and we're not even aware

679
00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:05.330
of it. Um And I might be trying to

680
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:09.370
tell you something unexpected, but your uh systems of

681
00:39:09.379 --> 00:39:14.879
for processing noisy information are smoothing it out, but

682
00:39:14.889 --> 00:39:17.250
it may be distorting the message that I'm trying

683
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.330
to convey. So that's one answer is that we

684
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.850
know from a lot of research that people misinterpret

685
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.899
each other fairly often in our experiments. But now

686
00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:32.649
real life, how often do people actually in real

687
00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:35.189
life misinterpret each other? Because the thing is in

688
00:39:35.199 --> 00:39:38.899
our experiments, we've designed our stimuli to be confusing.

689
00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:41.100
We've designed, we know the dog was bitten by

690
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.120
the man. I've used the passive structure there. I've

691
00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:47.370
told you about something implausible because I want to

692
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.629
lure you into misunderstanding that sentence. And the same

693
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.030
goes for garden path sentences. So we can't, based

694
00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.760
on our estimates on how often people misinterpret each

695
00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.070
other in misinterpret language on the results of experiments

696
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.489
because those experiments are designed to elicit misinterpretations. But

697
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.409
what we can, but in when we've, what some

698
00:40:10.419 --> 00:40:14.580
researchers have done, not me, um I think people

699
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.800
like um Doug Roland and uh Jan uh Jassy

700
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.360
have done this kind of work is to look

701
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.629
at cor big corpora of language, you know, just

702
00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:28.824
big chunks, naturally spoken language and looked at how

703
00:40:29.034 --> 00:40:34.284
truly ambiguous things are in real context. And what

704
00:40:34.294 --> 00:40:37.665
they show is that when you take into account

705
00:40:37.675 --> 00:40:42.304
all this additional sources of information that people can

706
00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:46.225
rely on language isn't as ambiguous as we might

707
00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:49.014
think. And so it's probably the case that we

708
00:40:49.024 --> 00:40:53.199
misunderstand each other a lot less. Then our experiments

709
00:40:53.209 --> 00:40:56.770
would suggest because we normally have a lot of

710
00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:02.159
opportunities to clarify what we meant. And just generally,

711
00:41:02.169 --> 00:41:06.770
the signal in real conversations is much richer than

712
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.020
it is in an experiment in experiments. People are

713
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.550
in a darkened room and they're, you know, looking

714
00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.260
at single sentences on a computer screen in real

715
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.550
life, you can use my speech, but you can

716
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.629
also use my, you know, my gestures, you can

717
00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:23.479
use um the what I've said in the previous

718
00:41:23.489 --> 00:41:26.110
45 minutes, you know, all of these things to

719
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.360
help you and you might also know some things

720
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.270
about me. So you might know that certain errors

721
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.120
that I tend to make in speech. So it's

722
00:41:34.129 --> 00:41:37.860
kind of a different situation in real language. So

723
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.530
what I would say is that language. Fortunately, the

724
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.889
language systems have evolved to be very, very efficient

725
00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.879
and to enable us to communicate. Nevertheless, we can

726
00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:50.919
say that we always understand each other correctly, right?

727
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.540
The world is full of misunderstandings.

728
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.409
Yeah, I I was actually going to say and

729
00:41:57.419 --> 00:42:00.129
if anything that I'm about to say is incorrect,

730
00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:02.649
please correct me. But I was going to say

731
00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:06.060
that in real life. I mean, as you said,

732
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.969
there, we have many more cues to draw from

733
00:42:09.979 --> 00:42:15.649
like for example, non verbal cues, body language gestures.

734
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:19.459
And so for example, if I hear someone using

735
00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:23.030
an incorrect word, perhaps they're pointing at something and

736
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.340
I immediately understand what, what they meant by what

737
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.500
they were saying, right? And sometimes by intonation or

738
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.780
something like that or uh uh or perhaps sometimes

739
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:42.110
uh people misspeak, but they the the next sentence,

740
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.699
uh they, I mean, clarify what they mean or

741
00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:49.669
perhaps with the next sentence, we have added context

742
00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:53.149
to what they said previously. And then we understand

743
00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:56.229
really what they were trying to say. And also

744
00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:59.830
I guess that even the talker, the peop the

745
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:05.949
person who's speaking also react to how the other

746
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:10.389
person reacts to them talking. And perhaps there are

747
00:43:10.399 --> 00:43:15.449
instances where we understand that perhaps we said something

748
00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:18.520
that the other person might have misunderstood or we

749
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.010
might have misspoken in some way and we go

750
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.780
back and add more information or correct ourselves. Or

751
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.870
sometimes I guess what happens is that we just

752
00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:34.770
misinterpret what people said, but it's just something that

753
00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:38.590
doesn't matter that much. And so it makes no

754
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.489
difference at all for our interaction, for our life

755
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.669
and stuff like that.

756
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.280
Right. Right. Uh, I think I, that's all of

757
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.689
that is absolutely correct. And it makes a, helps

758
00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:52.820
to make a point that I've often tried to

759
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.270
communicate in my work, which is that when we

760
00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.790
look at misinterpretations and ambiguity and how ambiguities are

761
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.489
resolved, we're not doing it because we think this

762
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.550
is a general problem in language. Garden Path sentences,

763
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.429
for example, don't happen very often in real language.

764
00:44:11.479 --> 00:44:13.590
What we're trying to do is to uncover the

765
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.409
mechanisms that the language processing system uses. And just

766
00:44:18.419 --> 00:44:23.820
like we have to invent devices for telling us

767
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.959
for giving us measures that we can use to

768
00:44:26.969 --> 00:44:30.739
record what's happening. We have to invent sentences or

769
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.979
stimuli that kind of crack the system they break.

770
00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:37.530
So by the reason we, we like sentences with

771
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.104
ambiguities in them or sentences that are likely to

772
00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:43.965
be misinterpreted is because in some ways by showing

773
00:44:43.975 --> 00:44:47.885
where the system breaks, we can get an idea

774
00:44:47.895 --> 00:44:51.925
of the mechanisms that are involved in normal language

775
00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:55.465
processing. So we will, we know for example, that

776
00:44:55.705 --> 00:45:01.110
uh people uh seem to treat the heads of

777
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.409
phrases as particularly important. Um And we know that

778
00:45:04.419 --> 00:45:06.850
on the basis of these experiments that we've done

779
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.820
that manipulate whether there's a garden path or not

780
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.090
and the point isn't what happens in Garden Path

781
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.350
sentences. The point is how do people interpret heads

782
00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.320
of phrases and heads of phrases of course occur,

783
00:45:19.899 --> 00:45:22.719
you know, by definition, you know, every phrase has

784
00:45:22.729 --> 00:45:24.979
a head, so heads of phrases are all over

785
00:45:24.989 --> 00:45:28.399
the place. So that's just one example to make

786
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:30.500
the point that yes, exactly what you say is

787
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.620
true, which doesn't mean that it's pointless to study

788
00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:36.020
these weird sentences or to look at how people

789
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:40.439
misinterpret each other. But that it tells us what

790
00:45:40.449 --> 00:45:44.659
is the architecture that's enabling the language system to

791
00:45:44.669 --> 00:45:46.020
be so robust.

792
00:45:46.729 --> 00:45:48.600
Uh uh No, of course, the point I was

793
00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.330
making was just that perhaps we don't have to

794
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.709
be too worried about misinterpreting language because someone might

795
00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:01.500
misunderstand what you were saying there or what I

796
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.870
was saying just a few seconds ago and think

797
00:46:03.879 --> 00:46:08.300
that, oh my God, we're misinterpreting language all the

798
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:08.870
time.

799
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:11.870
Of course, there are situations, you know, like in

800
00:46:11.879 --> 00:46:13.929
a courtroom, for example, where you have to be

801
00:46:13.939 --> 00:46:18.070
very careful not to get misinterpreted. But fortunately, normally

802
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.989
we're not, we're not being um questioned or grilled

803
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.949
about anything. So we don't have to worry about

804
00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:28.189
that level of precision. You know, when you teach

805
00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:30.389
also though, you know, you're very conscious of the

806
00:46:30.399 --> 00:46:34.389
fact that you can get misinterpreted. You can say

807
00:46:34.399 --> 00:46:37.229
something in a way that's unclear, use a word

808
00:46:37.239 --> 00:46:39.709
that a student doesn't know that you haven't bothered

809
00:46:39.719 --> 00:46:42.800
to define yet. So a lot of language processing

810
00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.560
is about not only saying what you want to

811
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.310
say, but formulating a model of your interlocutor so

812
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.100
that you can uh produce utterances or write sentences

813
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.959
that are likely to be understood. So the burden

814
00:46:58.969 --> 00:47:01.399
is not just on the comprehend or to understand,

815
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.239
but the burden is also on the speaker or

816
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:08.639
the writer or the signer to produce uh sentences

817
00:47:08.649 --> 00:47:13.139
that are appropriate to the person they're communicating with.

818
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:19.290
So, still on the topic of uh fluency of

819
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.469
language production, does it have any relationship at all

820
00:47:24.479 --> 00:47:27.850
with individual differences? Like for example, in terms of

821
00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.290
intelligence and executive function?

822
00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:37.000
Um Yeah, so that's something that I looked at

823
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:40.209
in some of my earlier work. And um and

824
00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:41.729
I mentioned the work that we had done on

825
00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:45.709
A DH D and it, there is some evidence

826
00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:54.010
that the that's comprehend well. So for, let's take

827
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.300
an obvious example, like vocabulary. So a component of

828
00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:02.689
language production is producing words and producing words that

829
00:48:02.699 --> 00:48:05.439
fit the meaning that you're trying to convey as

830
00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:09.649
accurately as possible. Um That's going to be related

831
00:48:09.659 --> 00:48:12.070
to the size of your vocabulary. And we already

832
00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.350
talked about lexical diversity in the context of, you

833
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.350
know, older adults who've had more time and experience

834
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.870
in which to acquire bigger vocabularies. Um We also

835
00:48:22.879 --> 00:48:25.909
know that whatever you might think of the validity

836
00:48:25.919 --> 00:48:31.060
of um standardized assessments like IQ tests and um

837
00:48:31.149 --> 00:48:34.340
GREs and things like that. A big component of

838
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.360
those tests is vocabulary. And so uh the people

839
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:41.780
with bigger vocabularies tend to end up with higher

840
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.219
scores on things like IQ tests and um other

841
00:48:45.229 --> 00:48:49.139
kinds of standardized assessments. And so that would suggest

842
00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:54.439
that there's a relationship between IQ and uh language

843
00:48:54.449 --> 00:48:59.639
production, but it's really um probably mediated by other

844
00:48:59.649 --> 00:49:03.110
things that we don't really understand very well, like

845
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:06.610
uh how that vocabulary is acquired, what kinds of

846
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.030
experiences have gone into the opportunities that people have

847
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.050
had to acquire vocabulary. And then some of the

848
00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.810
factors you've also mentioned like inhibition. Um So, uh

849
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:23.129
the relationship between inhibition and and other cognitive systems

850
00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:25.770
is something that we're only beginning to understand. But

851
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.199
there are teams of researchers um like Al Kim

852
00:49:29.209 --> 00:49:33.219
and Jared Novik, for example, who've been focusing heavily

853
00:49:33.229 --> 00:49:35.639
on the role that inhibition might be playing in

854
00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:40.129
individual differences in language processing. So, um I think

855
00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:42.800
it's a really interesting question. I think it's really,

856
00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:46.330
really hard to study because uh there's so many

857
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.050
dimensions on which people can differ from each other.

858
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.949
But in general, um there's, it's almost certainly going

859
00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:56.360
to be the case that individual differences in cognitive

860
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.090
skills are going to correlate with language production and

861
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.050
comprehension skills as well.

862
00:50:03.439 --> 00:50:06.310
By the way, on the topic of comprehension, in

863
00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.389
what ways does redundant information contribute to it?

864
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.459
OK. So that's a really big question. Um Right.

865
00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:22.620
So, redundancy in language has been a topic that

866
00:50:22.629 --> 00:50:26.840
we've been, it's motivated linguistic and psycholinguistics theories for

867
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.360
decades and decades. And it goes back back to

868
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.989
the gray and maxims about, you know, to be

869
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.770
brief is, you know, one of the things you're

870
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.750
supposed to do and being brief means don't produce

871
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:44.500
any unnecessary words. Uh And there, there are views

872
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.020
currently of the efficiency of the language processing system

873
00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:51.239
that kind of go along with that idea that,

874
00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:55.540
you know, generally speaking uses up metabolic uh is,

875
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.429
you know, is metabolically demanding. So I want to

876
00:50:59.439 --> 00:51:02.780
communicate my ideas as efficiently as I possibly can.

877
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.489
Redundancy would seem to be um inconsistent with that

878
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.669
goal. Um So, you know, Bryce would seem to

879
00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:11.260
be on the right track when he says that

880
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.030
people should not be redundant. But as more and

881
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:18.919
more work is showing speakers are redundant and listeners

882
00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:23.939
benefit from that redundancy. Uh So, for example, um

883
00:51:23.949 --> 00:51:27.379
what uh Grace would say is that, for example,

884
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:29.590
I should not call this a green pen. I

885
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.639
should just call it a pen because there's no

886
00:51:32.649 --> 00:51:35.639
other pen right now in the discourse. So to

887
00:51:35.649 --> 00:51:40.439
include the color at modifier is pointless. It's, it's

888
00:51:40.449 --> 00:51:44.280
information that you don't need. Um But what we

889
00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.919
now know from a lot of research is that

890
00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:50.830
for example, color as a trait is an extremely

891
00:51:50.949 --> 00:51:55.129
salient property. And in fact, there's research showing that

892
00:51:55.139 --> 00:51:57.439
I'm more likely to call this a green pen

893
00:51:57.459 --> 00:52:01.135
in English. Um This is worked by Rubio Fernandez.

894
00:52:01.145 --> 00:52:02.784
Um I'm more likely to call this a green

895
00:52:02.794 --> 00:52:05.245
pen when I'm speaking in English than I would

896
00:52:05.254 --> 00:52:07.195
if I were speaking in Spanish or they say

897
00:52:07.205 --> 00:52:11.935
Portuguese because the adjective comes first. And if I'm

898
00:52:11.945 --> 00:52:14.945
speaking in English, and I'm going to say the,

899
00:52:15.425 --> 00:52:19.189
you know, by producing green, you know what I'm

900
00:52:19.199 --> 00:52:22.179
referring to because in this context, I can't quite

901
00:52:22.189 --> 00:52:24.169
see what's in my background. But the green things

902
00:52:24.179 --> 00:52:27.530
are this pen, maybe that plant and the stuff

903
00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.989
in the outside the window. So by producing a

904
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.860
redundant adjective and or at least an adjective that

905
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:37.100
isn't necessary in the context because it's the only

906
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:40.419
pencil, I actually will help you to identify the

907
00:52:40.429 --> 00:52:45.120
referent more quickly. Um So, and we also know

908
00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:51.580
that people say things like uh repeat again and

909
00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.250
repeat again is redundant. Um And I have a

910
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.209
phd student working with me named um Casey Felton

911
00:52:58.389 --> 00:53:02.060
and he's looking at uh people's production of things

912
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:06.840
like lift up. So in English, we say lift

913
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.340
up the table. Um BUT the meaning of lift

914
00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:14.620
is to elevate. And so you don't need that

915
00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:18.860
particle in theory, it's, it is truly redundant. Um

916
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:23.340
But this is so, so common in com in

917
00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:27.739
regular language, we say add in subtract out, mix

918
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:32.689
together uh combine together it's, you know, just all

919
00:53:32.699 --> 00:53:33.600
over the place.

920
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:38.389
So all of those expressions redundant expressions we also

921
00:53:38.399 --> 00:53:42.429
have in Portuguese like for example, repeat again, we

922
00:53:42.439 --> 00:53:46.830
say Ruperto Trevis something like that. So we're always

923
00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.330
saying that as well,

924
00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.149
which suggests that it's a general tendency on the

925
00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:57.800
part of humans that they are redundant. So I

926
00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:59.729
think then the question gets to be, well, what

927
00:53:59.739 --> 00:54:04.550
is efficiency and efficiency isn't just producing the fewest

928
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.850
syllables per unit of meaning it could be efficient

929
00:54:08.889 --> 00:54:13.409
to provide listeners with redundancy because it does give

930
00:54:13.419 --> 00:54:16.070
them multiple opportunities to get your message. And we

931
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.949
had just been talking about the uh the opportunities

932
00:54:19.959 --> 00:54:23.199
for misinterpretation that are in language and how perhaps

933
00:54:23.209 --> 00:54:26.370
in real conversations we're not so bad at understanding

934
00:54:26.379 --> 00:54:30.709
each other. Maybe it's because we're redundant and repeat

935
00:54:30.719 --> 00:54:35.030
again in is technically redundant. And your teachers would

936
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.320
yell at you for saying that. But in real

937
00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:40.270
life, if I'm teaching my class and I say,

938
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.469
OK, I want you to redo this again. Um

939
00:54:43.632 --> 00:54:45.372
I tend not to say that but imagine if

940
00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:49.392
I said I'm giving my students two chances to

941
00:54:49.402 --> 00:54:52.241
get my meaning. I give them the re on

942
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:54.572
redo and I give them again as a separate

943
00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:58.822
word. And now my meaning becomes clear. Um I

944
00:54:58.832 --> 00:55:00.761
see this a lot in, I don't know if

945
00:55:00.771 --> 00:55:04.892
you ever do like online um exercise videos and

946
00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:07.852
things where the instructor will say, OK, so let's

947
00:55:07.862 --> 00:55:10.894
repeat that again. And you know, because it's really

948
00:55:10.904 --> 00:55:14.233
important that you understand that we're going to now

949
00:55:14.243 --> 00:55:16.894
do the same exercise that we just did. And,

950
00:55:16.904 --> 00:55:19.134
you know, you need to understand that that's what's

951
00:55:19.144 --> 00:55:22.593
coming next. So repeat again, is very healthy or

952
00:55:22.604 --> 00:55:26.553
helpful, healthy. Um There, there was this feature. Um

953
00:55:26.993 --> 00:55:32.783
So in general, I think redundancy is valuable. Um

954
00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:39.645
PARTLY because listeners attention wanders and they uh they

955
00:55:39.656 --> 00:55:42.095
might not know what you meant at this point,

956
00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.315
but they will know what you mean at a

957
00:55:43.325 --> 00:55:45.775
later point in the sentence. So there's more and

958
00:55:45.785 --> 00:55:49.635
more of an appreciation and a respect for redundancy

959
00:55:49.645 --> 00:55:53.575
in language that it actually benefits the comprehend or

960
00:55:53.615 --> 00:55:56.696
uh and allows the speaker to convey their message

961
00:55:56.706 --> 00:56:00.236
more clearly. It also is just less, less abrupt.

962
00:56:00.246 --> 00:56:05.219
So lift, lift that versus lift that up, you

963
00:56:05.229 --> 00:56:09.649
know, the up is somehow gentler it g it

964
00:56:09.659 --> 00:56:13.290
makes the instruction a little bit gentler and um

965
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.129
I don't quite know what's going on with that,

966
00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:17.080
but I have that as an intuition.

967
00:56:17.699 --> 00:56:21.909
Yeah. So I have two more topics I would

968
00:56:21.919 --> 00:56:24.949
like to ask you about. Uh WE'VE already mentioned

969
00:56:24.959 --> 00:56:28.590
eye tracking several times here today. So how do

970
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.770
you actually study reading and information processing through eye

971
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.300
tracking? And what can we learn from it

972
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:42.790
exactly? So we know that the eyeball is structured

973
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.750
so that there is a, so we know about

974
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.530
the retina on the back of the eye, you

975
00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.969
know, the collection of cells that are responsible for

976
00:56:50.979 --> 00:56:54.449
our ability to um process visual details, especially the

977
00:56:54.459 --> 00:56:57.149
cones, right? The cones are the the cells that

978
00:56:57.159 --> 00:57:02.149
are allowing us to, to read essentially or to

979
00:57:02.179 --> 00:57:07.500
extract visual detail. And the this foveal area vision

980
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.020
is actually quite small. And what that means is

981
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:14.179
that we need to make eye movements in order

982
00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:18.350
to process the information in the environment. And eye

983
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:22.459
trackers capitalize on that fact. So when we read

984
00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:25.530
and imagine we're reading text like English or Portuguese

985
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.620
that's read left to right top to bottom. Um

986
00:57:28.629 --> 00:57:34.719
We will, our eyes will land on to right

987
00:57:34.729 --> 00:57:37.060
around the middle of a word. Typically, it's a

988
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.760
little bit left of center. Um BUT right about

989
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.209
the middle of a word and then we move

990
00:57:42.219 --> 00:57:44.300
our eyes to the next word and then we

991
00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.580
move our eyes to the next word and we,

992
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:50.080
and we're basically reading each and every word in

993
00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:52.419
a text except for words like the and of

994
00:57:52.429 --> 00:57:54.959
which we tend to skip over probably could because

995
00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:58.280
we can see them in our peripheral vision and

996
00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:03.399
they're also highly constrained contextually. So we, when we

997
00:58:03.409 --> 00:58:05.719
look at a visual scene, it's the same thing.

998
00:58:05.729 --> 00:58:08.040
So when you look at like what's behind me

999
00:58:08.149 --> 00:58:10.360
in order, you can get a sense in in

1000
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:12.370
one fixation that you're looking at some kind of

1001
00:58:12.379 --> 00:58:15.889
a home office. But you in order to identify

1002
00:58:15.899 --> 00:58:18.219
what are the actual objects in the scene, you

1003
00:58:18.229 --> 00:58:20.560
have to make fixations all around it. You know

1004
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.719
that there's a clock over here and that there's

1005
00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:24.959
a picture on the floor for some weird reason

1006
00:58:24.969 --> 00:58:28.590
underneath the window, you know, et cetera. So, um

1007
00:58:29.899 --> 00:58:32.340
what this means then is that the position of

1008
00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:35.469
the eye is giving us information about what the

1009
00:58:35.479 --> 00:58:39.149
comprehend is attending to. So, if I want to

1010
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:42.300
know what word you're paying, you're currently processing. When

1011
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.919
you're reading some information on a computer screen, you,

1012
00:58:45.929 --> 00:58:48.320
the position of your eyeball is gonna tell me

1013
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:50.709
that. So what I need is an eye movement

1014
00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:54.189
monitoring system that essentially records the position of the

1015
00:58:54.199 --> 00:58:58.899
pupil that tells me where you're looking. And that

1016
00:58:58.909 --> 00:59:03.350
eye movement recording system allows me to identify the

1017
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.610
exact word that you're currently looking at and even

1018
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.459
the character within the world that you're looking at.

1019
00:59:10.669 --> 00:59:12.250
Um In fact that you can even get more

1020
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.360
precision than, than a single character on a computer

1021
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:19.350
screen. So what we've learned from this kind of

1022
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.810
eye tracking research is that, as I've mentioned, people

1023
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.830
tend to fixate on each individual word except for

1024
00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.229
some highly predictable, highly frequent words and that the

1025
00:59:29.239 --> 00:59:33.719
fixation durations. So the length of an individual fixation

1026
00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:38.104
correlates with the difficulty of the word that's currently

1027
00:59:38.114 --> 00:59:42.205
being processed. So a word like cat would be,

1028
00:59:42.215 --> 00:59:44.334
would receive a shorter fixation than a word like

1029
00:59:44.344 --> 00:59:47.955
feline because feline is a longer word, but also

1030
00:59:47.965 --> 00:59:51.580
because it's a less common word. And we also

1031
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:54.629
know that when people get garden path sentences, when

1032
00:59:54.639 --> 00:59:57.459
they get to the part of the sentence where

1033
00:59:57.469 --> 01:00:01.419
they realize they've messed up, they will exhibit long

1034
01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:05.820
fixations and they'll also do multiple fixations. So they

1035
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.959
usually, you only look, you only fixate on a

1036
01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:11.100
word once or twice. But if this, the sentences

1037
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.530
become confusing, you'll look at it multiple times and

1038
01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.236
you'll actually also make a backwards eye movement called

1039
01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.406
a regression as if you're sort of going. Oh

1040
01:00:20.716 --> 01:00:23.416
This is hopeless. Let me start again here and

1041
01:00:23.426 --> 01:00:26.196
you go backwards and skilled readers make a lot

1042
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.115
of regressions. It's not a sign that of failure.

1043
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.956
It's actually what efficient reading looks like. So we

1044
01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:34.966
use the eye movement monitoring system or eye tracking

1045
01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:38.075
to give us. Uh YOU know, I mentioned before

1046
01:00:38.085 --> 01:00:42.122
that language processing comprehension is, but we can actually

1047
01:00:42.132 --> 01:00:44.912
make it a little less private by monitoring the

1048
01:00:44.922 --> 01:00:47.451
position of your eyes. I can tell if I

1049
01:00:47.461 --> 01:00:49.931
put you on an eye tracker, what words you're

1050
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:53.072
looking at, how long you're spending on that word.

1051
01:00:53.122 --> 01:00:56.662
Um How long the eye movement is over to

1052
01:00:56.672 --> 01:00:59.031
the next word, et cetera. And that gives us

1053
01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:02.981
a lot of valuable information about information processing uh

1054
01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:04.941
during language comprehension.

1055
01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:10.280
So I have one final question. Then this is

1056
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:13.879
a topic that is I guess unrelated to the

1057
01:01:13.889 --> 01:01:16.820
others to some extent. But when it comes to

1058
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:20.159
language learning, and I guess that many people out

1059
01:01:20.169 --> 01:01:22.820
there would be interested in language learning because they

1060
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:26.510
are parents or educators or they, they are interested

1061
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.560
in knowing if we can improve language learning, particularly

1062
01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:36.000
in Children, I guess. So can singing facilitate language

1063
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:36.560
learning.

1064
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:41.199
Oh, gosh, that's also, that's also a study I

1065
01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:44.860
probably should have suggested we not try to go

1066
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:47.149
into in too much detail because I'm going to

1067
01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:48.570
tell you. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm

1068
01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.649
gonna hijack this part of our conversation to tell

1069
01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:54.149
you a little bit about how we often do

1070
01:01:54.239 --> 01:01:58.750
science. So that study is a complete one off.

1071
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.879
It's a study that I did with, um, uh

1072
01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:06.300
Katie Overly and her phd student at the time

1073
01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.320
when I was at Edinburgh and I served on

1074
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:11.360
the committee of the graduate student who was working

1075
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:15.729
on that project. And what we showed in that

1076
01:02:15.739 --> 01:02:19.729
study is that, yeah, it looks like um, singing

1077
01:02:19.739 --> 01:02:22.010
can help people to learn, you know, a second

1078
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:25.729
language. Um But that was a study that I

1079
01:02:25.739 --> 01:02:30.229
worked on um completely as just sort of like

1080
01:02:30.239 --> 01:02:32.899
I said this one off, I've never really pursued

1081
01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:35.300
it again. So I couldn't tell you what the

1082
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.610
current literature on that topic looks like. I also

1083
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.860
would emphasize that that study focused on learning second

1084
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:47.169
language. I believe it was Hungarian. Um THAT, that

1085
01:02:47.179 --> 01:02:50.179
she was focusing on as, and she used that

1086
01:02:50.189 --> 01:02:53.189
just because it was unlikely that very many of

1087
01:02:53.199 --> 01:02:55.219
the subjects we would want to test already learn

1088
01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:58.550
New Hungarian and, or maybe it was Czech, see,

1089
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.909
I can't even remember what the second language was

1090
01:03:00.919 --> 01:03:04.580
that we were looking at. And um, but that's

1091
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.729
probably a different process from what we see in

1092
01:03:08.739 --> 01:03:12.810
first language learning in Children. Although we know that

1093
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:17.110
teachers and you know, educators, parents like to use

1094
01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.770
songs as a way to teach kids words. Um

1095
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.810
Maybe it makes them more memorable, memorable, makes them

1096
01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:26.709
uh the repet repetition helps them to learn. Um

1097
01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:29.300
Also it helps Children I think to learn phonological

1098
01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:32.689
patterns. So in, in song, you tend to get

1099
01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:37.199
rhymes and so rhymes are going to facilitate phonological

1100
01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:41.330
awareness and phonological awareness we know is really important

1101
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.699
for learning how to read. Um In fact, you

1102
01:03:43.709 --> 01:03:45.090
might know, I don't know if you know about

1103
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.790
the studies that were done a few decades ago

1104
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.500
on um on Portuguese illite illiterates. Um So people

1105
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:57.469
who after the revolution were um put into literacy

1106
01:03:57.479 --> 01:04:00.229
programs in Portugal. So adults who had never had

1107
01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:03.389
the opportunity to learn to read. And um so

1108
01:04:03.399 --> 01:04:07.260
like uh um oh his name is escaping me,

1109
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:10.399
a Portuguese researcher who spent his, most of his

1110
01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:12.729
career in Belgium did a lot of these um

1111
01:04:12.739 --> 01:04:16.100
studies along with Jos Allegria and some other people

1112
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:19.159
anyway, they show that people who are, who do

1113
01:04:19.169 --> 01:04:21.350
not read and write. Adults who did not know

1114
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.149
how to read and write had very little phonological

1115
01:04:25.159 --> 01:04:27.540
awareness. They could tell you how many syllables were

1116
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:30.129
in a word. They kind of intuitively understood things

1117
01:04:30.139 --> 01:04:32.469
like syllables, but they didn't understand the things like

1118
01:04:32.479 --> 01:04:34.899
phone names. And once they learned to read the

1119
01:04:34.909 --> 01:04:37.719
same adults could tell you that a word like

1120
01:04:37.729 --> 01:04:42.199
um stick has four sounds to it. Um Whereas

1121
01:04:42.209 --> 01:04:45.110
prior to literacy, they would say it had maybe

1122
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.560
three sounds to it. Um You know, if that

1123
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.590
anyway, so all of that is to say that

1124
01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:54.659
phonological awareness which could be something that is conveyed

1125
01:04:54.669 --> 01:04:59.620
through music, helps people to become literate or is

1126
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.590
a consequence of becoming literate. It's probably both a

1127
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:06.000
cause and a consequence and in that way is

1128
01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:08.639
sort of related to language learning. But here I'm

1129
01:05:08.649 --> 01:05:12.120
kind of speculating and I'm in some ways out

1130
01:05:12.129 --> 01:05:14.840
of my specific area of expertise. So,

1131
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.629
no, that, that's fair enough. So, Doctor Freud, just

1132
01:05:19.639 --> 01:05:22.080
before we go, would you like just to tell

1133
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.639
people where they can find you and your work

1134
01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:25.679
on the internet?

1135
01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.010
Um Yeah, so I, you can find me in

1136
01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.399
Davis, California most of the time. Um OR in

1137
01:05:33.409 --> 01:05:36.320
San Diego where my brother lives with his child.

1138
01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:39.379
My brother is also a psycho linguist. Um So

1139
01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:42.334
here at the University of California, San Diego, um

1140
01:05:42.344 --> 01:05:45.935
but on the internet, if you Google, my name,

1141
01:05:45.945 --> 01:05:49.225
um you usually, I will come up pretty, pretty

1142
01:05:49.235 --> 01:05:52.395
much the first or second item on your search.

1143
01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:54.804
There is a Fernando Ferreira in Brazil who's a

1144
01:05:54.814 --> 01:05:59.689
volleyball player. That's not me. Um But uh I,

1145
01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:04.550
and if you Google Fernando Ferreira Davis, then you,

1146
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.790
then you will find me pretty easily. So, yeah,

1147
01:06:07.989 --> 01:06:10.429
I'm easy to find Fernando Ferreira as I tell

1148
01:06:10.439 --> 01:06:14.320
people is a very common name. Um BUT not

1149
01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.709
so much in cognitive science. So

1150
01:06:17.229 --> 01:06:21.169
yeah, probably in Portugal it would be much more

1151
01:06:21.179 --> 01:06:21.790
common,

1152
01:06:22.139 --> 01:06:24.350
I guess. And Brazil, it seems like it's quite

1153
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.199
common in Brazil. So um yeah, yeah, when people

1154
01:06:28.209 --> 01:06:31.120
say your name, it's so unusual. It's like only

1155
01:06:31.129 --> 01:06:31.919
here.

1156
01:06:33.479 --> 01:06:37.000
Great. So I'm leaving some links to your work

1157
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:39.489

1158
