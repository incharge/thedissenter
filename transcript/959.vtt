00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.780
Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:09.710
joined by Edgar Dubourg. He is a phd candidate

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.010
in Cognitive Science at the Department of the Cognitive

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.049
that they are called No Super. Uh IN France,

6
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:21.010
he uses uh insights from both the natural sciences

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.200
and the humanities and both computational and experimental methods

8
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:29.920
to explain the psychological foundations and cultural evolution of

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.668
fictions. And that's what we're going to talk about

10
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.610
today. So, Edgar, welcome to the show. It's a

11
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:36.849
big pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.340
Thank you. Uh It's a real pleasure to be

13
00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.159
here. Thank you for the invitation. Really

14
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.360
great. So let's start perhaps with this because I

15
00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.970
know that you try to tackle fiction from several

16
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.590
different perspectives and frameworks. And one of them, I

17
00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:56.400
guess is an evolutionary perspective. So do we know

18
00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.520
how old fiction is in human societies?

19
00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.040
Um Yes, it's uh uh I actually, no, I

20
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.819
think we don't quite know, but it's a really

21
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.180
great question to, to begin with. And uh uh

22
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.449
maybe it's uh it, it would be good to

23
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.029
start by noting why uh this is uh this

24
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.889
question matters. A lot. Uh, I think part of

25
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.779
your question is, is like, uh, about, uh, whether

26
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.139
to, to know whether fission is part of our

27
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.739
nature or biology or if, uh, if it is

28
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.370
a species typical trait and it's a fair question

29
00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:33.940
because we, we, uh, in all societies where you

30
00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:37.500
have, uh, fiction movies or TV, series, man, uh,

31
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.029
uh, literary works or oral stories, it seems that

32
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.650
people enjoy them a lot. So, so how can

33
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.190
we know if uh if it is a, a

34
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.410
specialty trait or universal trait? Uh Well, as you

35
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:53.680
said, uh uh often for other cognitive or V

36
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.480
traits, uh we, um we look at the history

37
00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.139
of the traits and try to evaluate when it

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.279
emerged because if it, uh if it is here

39
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.160
for a long time, if, if we, if, if

40
00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.788
it is here in humans, uh for instance, uh

41
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.850
since humans emerged like 3000, uh 100,000 years ago,

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.410
approximately, then we know, uh at least it's first

43
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.770
evidence that it is a species of typical trait.

44
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.169
So, and also we could also examine uh whether

45
00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:30.020
fiction is uh appears in different societies worldwide or

46
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.750
if it is present even in nonhuman animals for

47
00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:38.130
instance. But uh uh first, uh it seems that

48
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.529
uh to, to evaluate this, uh we need a

49
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.690
good definition of fiction and this is where it's,

50
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.100
it can get tricky, I think uh you, you

51
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.979
need a good definition of any trait. To be

52
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.649
able to quantify its presence in, be it in

53
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.210
different periods as you asked, uh different societies or

54
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.940
even in different species. Uh And here, I think

55
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.649
it's a problem because with the definition, the definition

56
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.300
of fiction, I think is not cons and uh

57
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.639
it's, it might be controversial across sees at least.

58
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.059
Um And I, in my view, it has not

59
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.300
been uh like properly naturalized in a way that

60
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.589
would allow us to, to do such cross cultural

61
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.160
or temporal or cross species analysis. So there, I

62
00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.360
think maybe we can start to write right in

63
00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.229
the, in the, in the, in this question, which

64
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.800
is the uh I think we can differentiate uh

65
00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.809
between three broad definition of fiction and maybe at

66
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.929
least, maybe there are more. Um II, I have

67
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.399
not worked this through as a, as a anybody.

68
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.850
Uh And so this is highly speculative, but let's

69
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.130
group them and make the whole definition of fiction

70
00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.320
would be the ability, the cognitive ability to uh

71
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.669
to, to make fiction in one's mind. So some

72
00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.940
biologists or cognitive might call simulation uh or imagination.

73
00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:07.089
Uh So the definition of fiction here has the

74
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.419
capacity to simulate things in, in our head. Um

75
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.389
I think it is present actually in uh many

76
00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.320
non human animals. Uh TAKE for instance, a square

77
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.690
when it wants to make a jump from one

78
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.320
tree to another, it simulates uh the jump just

79
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:27.660
before in order to uh to, to evaluate in

80
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.190
advance, uh the first ability of the action, the

81
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.149
probability it will, it will have to, to fulfill

82
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.179
the goal it has. So this is really, really

83
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.679
adaptive. Uh And here for a long time, I

84
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.010
think, um because it allows to, to, to get

85
00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:46.619
the benefits of, uh, of trial and error without,

86
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.149
uh without uh possibly failing. So it's really, uh

87
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.540
it's really uh beneficial. Um So it seems that

88
00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:59.649
we don't want to call the simulation of a

89
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.959
German by a squirrel a fiction. So this is

90
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.820
where I think it's not the right definition. Um

91
00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:10.119
Because uh well, it's not what we want to,

92
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.690
to study here. So it seems that fiction is

93
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.220
not just about the simulation of things that don't,

94
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.890
that don't exist because it's not. So uh another

95
00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.579
broad definition is about um uh still a bit

96
00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:28.769
narrow, but still broad is about artistic representation. So

97
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.079
here, fiction would be uh a, a kind of

98
00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.149
representation of an individual uh that other individuals from

99
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.700
the same species find active. Uh And here again,

100
00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:44.179
it's not uh specific to humans. Uh I have

101
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.320
the, I have the example of the p fishes.

102
00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.420
I don't know if you know that they draw

103
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:53.059
uh like beautiful patterns on the, on the ocean

104
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.170
floor, on the sound, uh the circles and uh

105
00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:00.750
they are specific specifically made uh because they are

106
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.369
attractive here to the opposite sex. Uh So what's

107
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.540
important here is that they do that because uh

108
00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:10.630
it's attractive. Um And they are really beautiful. I

109
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.309
uh I encourage people who don't know about that

110
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.940
with good look on the internet because it's a

111
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.500
fascinating event for us humans. So it's, it's funny.

112
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.420
No, no, I actually watch that on youtube videos

113
00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:25.059
and it's really fascinating. So, yeah, if people are

114
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.700
interested, you can find videos like that on youtube.

115
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.119
And also the, I don't know if you know

116
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.679
the book of uh uh Richard Pro and uh

117
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.980
the Evolution of Beauty, which is really about uh

118
00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:40.190
about all that beauty in animals. And I recommend

119
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.619
it to all the people who listen and who

120
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.679
are interested in this question. So if this is

121
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.230
fiction, if uh those drawings on the, on the

122
00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:53.519
ocean floor are fiction in a sense. Uh THEN

123
00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.320
uh the first fiction in humans would be uh

124
00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:01.200
maybe the, the c paintings around 60,000 years ago

125
00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:05.459
uh or maybe more likely other productions that I

126
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.790
don't know about that humans are made and that

127
00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:12.709
were uh made because they were attractive to other

128
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.420
people in the, in the species. So, I don't

129
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:18.429
know. Uh I really, I'm not an expert in

130
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.940
uh archaeology or relationship. So I don't, I don't

131
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.540
even know, but there might be productions even from

132
00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:27.600
the beginning. But I, in fact, I would suggest

133
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:31.619
to serve uh definition which is uh more strict

134
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.450
uh and which will require uh uh crafting uh

135
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:40.910
uh representation while explicitly uh uh signaling to the

136
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.869
individuals that it is not a real uh representation.

137
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.540
Uh So, for such a fiction to exist, uh

138
00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:52.000
you need some sort of uh pragmatic sense uh

139
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.500
as discussed in a recent paper in uh in

140
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.980
be senses by uh Ancient Scott Phillips. Uh So,

141
00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:02.970
it seems that humans are ended with such cognitive

142
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.480
mechanisms that allow a shared understanding. Um And therefore

143
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:12.579
that law uh for craters of fiction to make

144
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:16.649
sure that uh what they create is recognized as

145
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.839
uh A K A representation. Mhm um So according

146
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.309
to the definition, actually, it would be hard to,

147
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.910
to date the first fiction. So the first written

148
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.859
fiction, fictional story that seems overtly fictional is um

149
00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:36.940
sometimes uh sometimes we say it's uh the uh

150
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.450
but oral stories predate, of course, uh any written

151
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.130
story. Um And we would also have to quantify,

152
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.270
in fact, the extent to which at the moment

153
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.929
they were released, they were considered that they were

154
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.770
crafted uh with the intention to be rightly received

155
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.090
as false information. So this is uh how to

156
00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:02.929
quantify anything but uh really uh really fascinating. Mhm

157
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.219
So,

158
00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:06.320
so let me ask you perhaps two or three

159
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.309
questions about all of what you said there. So

160
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.049
first of all, when it comes to those uh

161
00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:17.729
three definitions in your own work, do you operate

162
00:09:17.739 --> 00:09:21.625
with uh a specific one? I and do you

163
00:09:21.635 --> 00:09:25.424
choose one of the three or is that something

164
00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:27.844
that you don't really do? I mean, you study

165
00:09:27.854 --> 00:09:32.684
fiction but in terms of the specific definition behind

166
00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:36.304
it, uh, it's not really that important for the

167
00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:38.924
kind of work you do. Which one is the

168
00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:39.924
correct one?

169
00:09:40.294 --> 00:09:42.635
Yeah, it's a great question. I think we, uh,

170
00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:45.604
the, the, the more specific, the definition, the, the

171
00:09:45.614 --> 00:09:48.924
better, uh, for any kind of work. But, uh,

172
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:52.309
uh, here I, uh, I think I tend to,

173
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.830
to work with the so definition, which was uh

174
00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:58.809
not the broadest, but uh still a bit broad

175
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.010
uh because I, I like to study entertainment. So

176
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.000
anything that appeal to women's mind, uh even if

177
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:11.150
people don't uh don't, don't realize, don't understand that

178
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:14.619
it is uh uh fictional uh in a, in

179
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.049
a stricter sense. Uh But actually, I am currently

180
00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:21.479
working on a, on a project that would uh

181
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.010
uh try to evaluate uh the uh evolution of

182
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.229
fictional in a stricter sense. That is the evolution

183
00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:32.799
of uh of the, of the extent to which

184
00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:38.109
people uh uh receive in uh rightly receive information

185
00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:41.520
uh as uh rightly receive the fiction as false

186
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.200
information. And this is a good uh approximation of

187
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.919
entertainment actually, because if we, if we consume works

188
00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:51.919
that we know are completely false, it means that

189
00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:53.580
I think that uh that we want to be

190
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.760
entertained. So we have to juggle between definition according

191
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.080
to the project that, that we have, I think.

192
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.960
Mhm uh AND of course, when it comes to

193
00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:07.770
the evolutionary foundations of our psychology, in particular cognitive

194
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.590
mechanisms, and here we are talking about fiction. So

195
00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:14.169
I would imagine that it involves several different cognitive

196
00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:16.549
mechanisms. And we're going to get into that in

197
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:21.320
a second. But one of the sources, you people

198
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.500
many times point to when they have access to

199
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.070
it for, to establish that a particular cognitive mechanism

200
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.280
or a particular behavior or feature of our psychology

201
00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:37.520
as an evolutionary foundation or is an evolved rate

202
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.359
is of course looking into other closely related or

203
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:46.159
sometimes not so closely related animal models. And you

204
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:50.346
mentioned there uh different examples like for example, the

205
00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:54.945
squirrel imagining, if it jumps in a particular way,

206
00:11:54.955 --> 00:11:57.645
if it will reach the other branch or the

207
00:11:57.656 --> 00:11:59.875
other three or something like that. But, but I

208
00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:05.606
was wondering um when you talk about that specific

209
00:12:05.616 --> 00:12:11.296
case, for example, is that really fiction or are

210
00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:16.875
you pointing to perhaps some evolutionary precursors to the

211
00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:20.901
cogni mechanisms that play a role in fiction? Because

212
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:26.012
even if other animals also have imagination, I mean,

213
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:31.291
imagination just by itself is not exactly the same

214
00:12:31.302 --> 00:12:35.651
as fiction. So, or, or are you really claiming

215
00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:39.992
that perhaps there are other animals who have fiction

216
00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:45.572
like uh uh cognitive traits? Let's say, how do

217
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:46.892
you reply to that?

218
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.479
Iii I really agree with the first uh proposition

219
00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:54.179
I make a comparison with animal to show that

220
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.580
uh uh uh other animals have the cog the,

221
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:03.169
the, the cognitive mechanisms necessary. Uh Some animals have

222
00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:06.059
some of the uh required mechanisms to make fiction.

223
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.989
Uh So it's kind of PURs, as you said,

224
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.729
uh, fiction but it's not, uh, I, I really

225
00:13:11.739 --> 00:13:16.059
think it's not fiction. Uh, I think, uh, simulation

226
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.619
and, uh Osten communication uh, are all adaptations that

227
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.989
are used uh by producers and consumers of fiction

228
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.280
to be able to share, uh, fictional stories. Yeah.

229
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.780
Mhm

230
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.070
uh So, uh I mean, we again, we'll get

231
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.940
into the specific cognitive mechanisms, but then fiction itself

232
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.669
wouldn't be uh a psychological trait. I mean, it

233
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:46.789
would be like the result or a by-product of

234
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:52.419
specific evolved psychological adaptations. Is that how you look

235
00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:56.109
at it or is it by itself uh an

236
00:13:56.119 --> 00:13:56.909
adaptation

237
00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:03.479
that it's a and it's a, it's a great

238
00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:06.770
question and I think it's uh still uh quite

239
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.830
uh controversial. Uh I don't know really where people

240
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.429
stand on this question. But uh in fact, as

241
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.469
you said, there is an adaptation is due uh

242
00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:21.570
with people who say that fiction evolved uh as

243
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.390
an adaptation. Uh So it would mean that fiction

244
00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:28.770
uh would have brought fitness benefits during, during our

245
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.190
revolutionary history. What uh yeah, you're referring to. So

246
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.979
it would uh it would mean to say that

247
00:14:38.099 --> 00:14:41.909
uh uh people who were interested in fiction reproduced

248
00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:46.390
more during the revolutionary history and therefore after generations,

249
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.500
uh this trait of reducing, consuming fiction would have

250
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.150
spread in the, in the population and here people,

251
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.479
uh In fact, we don't all agree about the,

252
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.500
uh the, the, the possible uh function, uh adaptive

253
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.809
function that it might fulfill if it were the

254
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.309
case. Um And the opposite side that you mentioned

255
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.059
is a by product one and it is uh

256
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.820
kind of simpler. It's, uh it's a fiction would

257
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.799
have no evolved function uh because it would be

258
00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:18.940
uh like a by product or side effect of

259
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.750
other psychological trait uh that emerged uh even before

260
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.109
uh fiction uh appeared in humans, actually, uh it

261
00:15:26.119 --> 00:15:29.989
emerged maybe before humans even emerged. And the view

262
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.440
had been, has been put forward by your student

263
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.270
in care. And also uh the cosine and John

264
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.270
to when they, they wrote that many features of

265
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.719
fiction uh seem to take advantage of uh of

266
00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:44.820
design, feature, features, design features of the mind that

267
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.770
uh were not targets of section because they caused

268
00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:52.859
enjoyment of fiction, but because they solved other uh

269
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:56.210
allergic problems. But uh I think there is a

270
00:15:56.219 --> 00:16:01.580
uh a third uh path, a third possibility uh

271
00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:05.150
which, which is where that section is neither uh

272
00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:09.099
uh natation per se, neither uh by product. Uh

273
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.429
uh BECAUSE it's created by human minds, as you

274
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.770
said, it's a, it's a result of uh human

275
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.599
cognition. And I believe, I believe we need uh

276
00:16:18.609 --> 00:16:22.359
to understand why uh our psychology motivates us to

277
00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:25.049
produce and consume fiction, even if such behaviors are

278
00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:28.700
not adaptation process that might be adaptive. Um And

279
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.760
this is where this is where um the work

280
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.400
of uh Nicola Boma, my supervisor, also Robert Stre

281
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.619
and Baskar Boe. Uh AND particularly one paper that

282
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.359
they wrote together uh about symbolic culture is uh

283
00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:46.469
according to me, really important because it kind of

284
00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:49.960
offers this sort of solution, which is we can

285
00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:53.510
focus on the adaptive goals that such productions may

286
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.090
indirectly fulfill. And they also show that we need

287
00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:02.570
to take into consideration the fitness uh benefits and

288
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.550
costs of uh the producers and the consumers of

289
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.050
s culture separately and try to understand what, what

290
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.449
would be the, the evolutionary advantage to, to, to

291
00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:17.939
produce or consume fiction. And in these scenarios, I

292
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:23.089
thought we could compare a fiction uh to uh

293
00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:26.520
for instance, uh a computer or a smartphone or

294
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.410
a kayak to, to, to take a an earlier

295
00:17:28.609 --> 00:17:31.969
exa MP. This is some kind of technology that's

296
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:35.530
something uh something that humans create uh to fulfill

297
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.329
some instrumental goals that would ultimately help, help them

298
00:17:39.339 --> 00:17:43.209
to fulfill uh goals. And in this, in this

299
00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:46.500
uh in this uh specific uh uh example of

300
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.819
fiction, we would say that it's a, a kind

301
00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:51.739
of entertainment technology with uh that's what we call

302
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.599
them with a new collar.

303
00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:56.319
Mhm No. Thi this actually reminds me quite a

304
00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:59.699
lot of the ongoing debate in the cognitive science

305
00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:03.479
of religion as to whether religion is itself an

306
00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:07.829
adaptation a by product of specific other specific adaptations,

307
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:11.969
just a result of genetic drift or the result

308
00:18:11.979 --> 00:18:15.449
of cultural evolution. Because there's also that and I

309
00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:17.869
know that you are also interested in the cultural

310
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.550
foundations of fiction and we'll get into that later.

311
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.540
But uh one more question about what you said

312
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.910
earlier. So of course, another kind of source that

313
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.550
people many times point to when talking about the

314
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:36.229
evolutionary foundations of specific psychological traits is looking at

315
00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:41.060
ancient societies, ancient human societies. But in this particular

316
00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:44.160
case of fiction, I mean, I guess that there's

317
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.660
a lot of guess work and speculation and speculation

318
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:51.579
that we have to, I mean, just deal with

319
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:55.469
because uh most of what we would classify as

320
00:18:55.479 --> 00:18:58.969
fiction, I mean, of course, we only have access

321
00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:04.010
to the material remains. I mean, what archaeologists basically

322
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.189
work with. And also there are many things that

323
00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:11.535
are pro we lost forever because fiction also expresses

324
00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:16.135
itself in oral traditions, right? And that's something that

325
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:20.464
just can't fossilize or be, uh, I mean, in

326
00:19:20.474 --> 00:19:25.314
some sort of way, uh be preserved materially.

327
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.270
Yeah, I, I agree that's a really difficult, uh,

328
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.660
that's, uh that's one reason why I don't work

329
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.599
that much on, uh on, uh on ancient, very

330
00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:44.579
ancient uh uh fictional works because uh I'm not,

331
00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:49.790
uh uh ii, I don't know what uh what

332
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.829
we might miss or what we are, what we

333
00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:54.989
don't know about, uh how we, how these fictional

334
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.199
stories were shared and, and I'm actually, I'm actually

335
00:19:58.209 --> 00:20:03.439
very happy to, to work on contemporary fiction. So

336
00:20:03.449 --> 00:20:05.040
uh so I, I have not so much to

337
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.849
say about uh about that actually.

338
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.969
No, that, that's, that's totally fair. So, uh but

339
00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:15.410
when it comes to the cognitive mechanisms that you

340
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.609
associate with fiction, you and of course, other people

341
00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:22.810
that work on this, what do we know about

342
00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:26.750
its psychological foundation? So in terms of the specific

343
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.689
cognitive mechanisms that play a role in fiction?

344
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:37.410
Mhm um We already uh talked about some of

345
00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.920
them, uh some of the skills that are the

346
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.520
cognitive skills that are necessary to make fiction like

347
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.920
simulation Osten communication. Um But I really think that

348
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.920
these are not the only psychological mechanisms that we

349
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:56.109
need to, to some fiction. Uh WHEN uh when

350
00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:58.550
uh a character of fiction uh create a fiction,

351
00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:03.760
um they can use the full spectrum of human

352
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.469
preferences. Uh And actually, they are limited only by

353
00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:11.869
uh their own psychology in fact. So it means

354
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.290
that uh so it's, it's where it can get

355
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.510
complex. Uh It means that to understand fiction, you

356
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.979
need to understand everything that is attractive to the

357
00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:23.050
human mind and to understand that you need uh

358
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.510
uh to consider all possible uh factors of psychological

359
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.510
factors of attraction uh to uh to take uh

360
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.030
uh a term by Dennis Barber. So it's uh

361
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.859
it's uh the program, for instance, if you, if

362
00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:39.910
you want to understand love stories, you need to

363
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.520
understand the specificities and the variability of, of romantic

364
00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:46.709
club, which is a, a specific psychological uh uh

365
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:49.819
mechanisms that are evolved in humans for par uh

366
00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:54.099
strategy for problem as a paing strategy. And you

367
00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:58.150
can make link between our psychology of psychology of

368
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.640
love. And uh uh the follow of stories, which

369
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.280
is when singer managed supervisor Nicole is working on

370
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.699
actually uh to understand why we, we have horror

371
00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:11.750
stories in the form of our movies or literature,

372
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.229
etc. We need a good understanding of the fear

373
00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:19.089
system, which is another, another psychological foundation of fiction

374
00:22:19.099 --> 00:22:22.910
I think. Uh uh And you need a good

375
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.030
understanding of the relating mechanisms like uh predator and

376
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.479
aggressor detectors uh which evolved in humans for her

377
00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:35.579
to, to, to avoid uh don't, potentially, don't use

378
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.890
animals in specs. And here there are people at

379
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.250
the uh recreational C lab like Ma Kin and

380
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:45.530
Coltan Schriner who work on just that. And I,

381
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.469
I myself worked on the how exploratory performances might

382
00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:53.510
explain uh the app for images and we might

383
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.489
talk about that a bit later. Um And we

384
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.589
could go on, go on and on and list

385
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.560
uh uh uh a long list of psychological mechanisms

386
00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:07.109
that can be and, and I, I think usually

387
00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:11.390
are activated by fictional stories while we consume them.

388
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.109
So, uh and, and I, we tried uh to

389
00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:18.839
list them in the collaborative paper that uh that

390
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:21.530
I've been working on for the past uh for,

391
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.420
since the beginning of my uh phd basically uh

392
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.500
and become a, a highly collaborative paper that uh

393
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.500
that is currently under review. But I think we

394
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.339
will uh will preprint it and it's, it's just

395
00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:36.160
that we try to list those the psychological mechanisms

396
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.000
that are the foundation of fiction and which uh

397
00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:45.589
combined might explain uh uh the di the, the

398
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:49.089
great diversity of fictional stories. Because we, uh as

399
00:23:49.099 --> 00:23:51.430
I started to list, we have a lot of

400
00:23:51.439 --> 00:23:54.760
different stories out there. And uh we need uh

401
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.869
all of the, all of our understanding of psychology,

402
00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:02.729
of human psychology to understand, I think uh uh

403
00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.579
uh fiction stories.

404
00:24:04.939 --> 00:24:08.089
Mhm. Yeah, we'll come back to some of what

405
00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:11.439
you said there when we talk about different kinds

406
00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:14.410
of fiction because there are of course different genres

407
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.500
here. So, but uh we've already touched a little

408
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.500
bit on the functions that fictions might serve when

409
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.030
we talked about the possibility of them or fiction

410
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.239
in general being an a, an evolved adaptation. But

411
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.359
what do we know about its function actually? And

412
00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:37.670
of course, here, I'm not necessarily pointing to an

413
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.189
adaptation is perspective because it might serve certain functions

414
00:24:42.199 --> 00:24:47.630
that do not necessarily translate into fitness benefits or

415
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.099
increased fitness. So, but what do we know about

416
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:51.410
that?

417
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.780
Um, WELL, we know what, what, what uh the,

418
00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:01.750
the, the, the way I tend to see it

419
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.280
is that as I said it's, uh, it's like

420
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.359
it's kind of a technology that, uh, that pulls

421
00:25:07.479 --> 00:25:11.790
off craft because uh they get uh attention from,

422
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.180
uh from the audience um and capturing the attention

423
00:25:16.189 --> 00:25:19.030
of people, uh might not be relative goals per

424
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.390
se, but it's a, it's a good instrumental goal

425
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.439
to fulfill their relative goals. Um For instance, uh

426
00:25:29.099 --> 00:25:31.800
it can allow you to uh appear as a

427
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.089
good coperative partner for, for instance, it can enhance

428
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:39.540
uh how you appear competent to other people because

429
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.640
you're, you're good, you're a skilled uh storyteller. Um

430
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.770
From here, I took at the producers item. You

431
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:54.459
can accumulate resources through exchange of services. Um You

432
00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:59.910
can transmit uh uh relevant uh fitness, relevant information

433
00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:03.310
to your team, uh which is again a good

434
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:08.439
goal. Um And I, I think, uh in fact,

435
00:26:08.449 --> 00:26:12.630
uh uh different researchers have worked on each of

436
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.479
these aspects, uh which are some kind of function

437
00:26:17.489 --> 00:26:20.900
that we might, we might call instrumental function or,

438
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.329
uh but not adaptive function, as you said. So

439
00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:27.479
there are a lot of them potentially, uh like

440
00:26:27.489 --> 00:26:30.560
uh a smartphone. Again, uh smartphone can be used

441
00:26:30.569 --> 00:26:32.500
in a lot of ways, have a lot of

442
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.989
functions. And uh and we use, uh we use

443
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.780
it actually to communicate uh to uh to uh

444
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.689
to orient ourselves to uh uh to play. Uh

445
00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:46.130
So it's uh it's hard to, to pinpoint one

446
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.270
and I think it's good to, to evaluate uh

447
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.270
a bunch of them uh that can be relevant

448
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.579
to explain its uh its success.

449
00:26:55.469 --> 00:26:58.430
Uh Actually you mentioned something there that I guess

450
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.900
a also applies to art in general or at

451
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.810
least the researchers who come from an evolutionary perspective

452
00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:10.170
apply that to art. That is that um there

453
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.650
are at least some features or specific kinds of

454
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.030
information that many times you find in fiction that

455
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:25.430
from an evolutionary perspective uh basically help communicate fitness,

456
00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:30.709
relevant information, right? I mean, things related to survival,

457
00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:34.550
reproduction and so on, we find lots of those

458
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.540
things in fiction as well,

459
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.660
right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, I do think

460
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.880
so in the studies are showing that MP that

461
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.140
you find any information about uh what to eat

462
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.859
and what not to eat, where to go and

463
00:27:49.869 --> 00:27:52.660
where not to go uh in a, in a,

464
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.390
in an target cities. Uh Again, since I'm uh

465
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.660
actually more interested in contemporary fiction, I think we

466
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.650
have less uh and that this is something really

467
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.339
interesting. In fact, we have less and less uh

468
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.880
uh relevant information, the more fictional the stories are.

469
00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:18.140
Um SO I, I would tend to say that

470
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.750
it's uh uh against uh non function that is

471
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.819
something that you can do. When you, when you

472
00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:30.579
capture other people's attention, you can transmit them uh

473
00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:35.260
v uh you can transmit them uh very important

474
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:40.140
uh uh fitness, relevant information. But this is not,

475
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.810
I think the only uh function uh, uh, fiction

476
00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:47.079
fulfilled. And I'm really more of broad, uh, I

477
00:28:47.089 --> 00:28:50.510
think there a broad range of, uh, of possible

478
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.790
things you can do once, once you get the

479
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.780
attention of, of an, uh, an audience. Yeah. Mhm.

480
00:28:57.449 --> 00:29:01.030
By the, by the way, when it comes to

481
00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:07.239
the kinds of, uh, social signaling that fiction allows,

482
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.550
uh, I mean, do you have any idea or

483
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.040
is there anyone out there that suggests that fiction

484
00:29:15.819 --> 00:29:20.719
might have been the product of sexual selection? I

485
00:29:20.729 --> 00:29:25.209
mean, is that something that perhaps uh people of

486
00:29:25.219 --> 00:29:30.489
the opposite sex or, uh by communicating something fictionally,

487
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.500
you might be si signaling uh some psychological traits

488
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.880
that are appealing to people of the opposite sex.

489
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.000
Is there anyone out there that suggests that or?

490
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.060
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's, it has been one hypothesis

491
00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:49.599
still is uh so Filar who was first started

492
00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:52.770
to, to, to, to, to, to oppose this hypothesis

493
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.010
that uh fiction can be used to uh to

494
00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.099
seduce the opposite sex. And actually there have been

495
00:30:00.109 --> 00:30:05.260
studies and there are still studies about, uh um

496
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.550
about the, the way uh producers of fiction are

497
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.810
uh more appealing to the opposite sex for instance.

498
00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:15.130
And it seems to be uh to be sometimes

499
00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.540
the case uh and um to this uh uh

500
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.260
point in that direction. But then again, I would

501
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.420
suggest that it is just uh uh one possible

502
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:33.010
function among uh among broader function. And here you,

503
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.619
you talked about uh social uh, function more generally,

504
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.290
I think they are, they are more, uh, more

505
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.369
generally, uh uh broader social functions other than just

506
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.119
uh seducing a poten poten potential made. Um, YEAH.

507
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.479
Yeah, I mean, one of them that we just

508
00:30:51.489 --> 00:30:55.229
talked about previously was the fact that you can

509
00:30:55.239 --> 00:31:00.609
transmit relevant information. I mean, fitness, relevant or non

510
00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:04.510
fitness, relevant information to, to other people. And also

511
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.810
the other traits that you mentioned previously that you

512
00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:11.869
can signal to other people that might make them

513
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.180
more uh open to cooperating with you, for example,

514
00:31:16.189 --> 00:31:18.119
right? I mean, it's not, uh of course, it

515
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.719
doesn't, it's not reducible to sexual selection. If that's

516
00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.520
right,

517
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.280
you can uh uh I think you can uh

518
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.189
consider to, to, to, to, I like to, to

519
00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:38.130
talk about some uh specific uh uh cases uh

520
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.829
just anecdotal evidence. But uh where you see that

521
00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:46.349
reputation is important in fiction sharing, uh you can

522
00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:49.189
consider papers for instance, that uh that there's a

523
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:53.709
difference in uh in satisfaction derived from creative pollution

524
00:31:54.099 --> 00:31:57.050
uh that are produced either by humans or by

525
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.339
uh artificial intelligence. And if we feel such predictions

526
00:32:01.349 --> 00:32:04.119
uh are different, uh which is what uh seems

527
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.290
to appear in the literature. Uh It seems that

528
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.969
the person behind uh the work is actually uh

529
00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:17.359
important uh important uh enough for people. Uh uh

530
00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:20.800
Not considering that it's the same thing if it's

531
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.489
a real human behind it or not. So I

532
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.030
think it's a good point to, to see that

533
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.510
uh the people behind it. And also, for instance,

534
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.849
there are another anecdotal evidence but I don't know,

535
00:32:32.959 --> 00:32:35.589
study about that. But uh the fact that when

536
00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:39.189
uh people don't know the person that uh created

537
00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:42.359
the fiction uh or the piece of art, for

538
00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:46.119
instance, in uh in art or, I don't know

539
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.839
if you know uh interaction which is the person

540
00:32:49.849 --> 00:32:51.930
we don't know. Uh WE don't know, it's a

541
00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:56.920
true uh her identity so that punk in music

542
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:01.310
and people talk a lot about these people. Uh

543
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.010
And uh and are really intrigued by any piece

544
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.109
of information that by giving their identity. And I

545
00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:09.359
think it's really uh peculiar. We could just, uh

546
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.550
we could just consume the work. But now we

547
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.010
have, we have to talk about the person behind

548
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.979
them and not knowing we, who, who they are

549
00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:20.650
is really something that bother that seems to bother

550
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.439
people. So it's all that to, to show that

551
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.300
I think it's uh it seems to be at

552
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.189
least uh important to people, for people to uh

553
00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:32.810
to use the production of uh the, the, the

554
00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:38.250
fiction here to infer uh specific uh traits, uh

555
00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:42.260
specific psychological traits and, and uh related to cooper

556
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:45.540
operation, I think to other people like their reliability,

557
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:52.239
their authenticity, uh their sy uh or, or alternatively,

558
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.119
there was a way around uh to use the

559
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.760
production but to use the what, what we know

560
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.770
about the people to infer uh to make inferences

561
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.829
about the production. So all that is related to

562
00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:09.510
uh to social dynamics that are not vegetable, to

563
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:16.659
just uh uh romantic or sexual selection. Mhm.

564
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.909
So, I think that we've already ended up talking

565
00:34:19.918 --> 00:34:23.520
about these hypotheses here that I'm about to mention.

566
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.159
Or at least we refer to some of uh

567
00:34:27.168 --> 00:34:31.370
the things that people mention in this hypothesis. But

568
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.570
uh just for the sake of addressing them directly,

569
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.320
uh could you tell us what the info uh

570
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:44.239
the entertainment hypothesis and the information hypotheses are here.

571
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:49.850
Um So it's just uh names to try to

572
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.438
categorize uh the different hypotheses that are out there.

573
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.100
Uh That's uh as, as we, as we said

574
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.320
earlier and as we discussed it with the, the

575
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.649
start the beginning of the discussion, there are many

576
00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:08.489
hypotheses about uh what feature stories might be good

577
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.939
for. Uh And I feel that it would, it

578
00:35:11.949 --> 00:35:15.129
would help to organize such hypothesis in two, you

579
00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:18.020
know, in not for, not necessarily two. But uh

580
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:22.070
here I have in mind two broad uh uh

581
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:28.699
group of the groups of hypotheses. Um The one

582
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:31.889
that proposes that people can use fiction to learn

583
00:35:31.899 --> 00:35:35.989
relevant information. And here it would be uh through

584
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.489
either simulation or communication or the more straightforward communication.

585
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.800
Is it about the social world, uh predators, uh

586
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:50.149
our own uh emotion, emotional responses to specific situations

587
00:35:50.479 --> 00:35:53.020
about the environments about what, what we eat or

588
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.169
not to eat, etcetera. So we have a lot

589
00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:58.570
of things that we might learn from fiction. Uh

590
00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.129
And there is the other side, uh I think,

591
00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:04.570
which is the entertainment uh hypothesis more broadly, which

592
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:11.320
bring together all the ideas where um which bring

593
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.459
together all the people who, who think that fiction

594
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.350
are kind of uh by definition, less informative than

595
00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.729
factual narratives. Uh So that would be, there would

596
00:36:25.739 --> 00:36:29.770
be less relevant uh to, to bring information to,

597
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.370
to capture information compared to reality. They would have

598
00:36:34.419 --> 00:36:38.580
uh uh by definition of uh uh uh how

599
00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:43.639
do you say uh um a negative aspect which

600
00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:47.189
is a fake. Uh But they get the benefit

601
00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:49.550
of uh of freedom. Uh I think this is

602
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.159
how I see it. Uh If you, if you

603
00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:56.010
allow yourself to create uh any story without the

604
00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.510
constraints of reality, or at least with uh less

605
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.459
constraints from reality, you can exaggerate what you want

606
00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:05.139
so that the things that you're telling uh are

607
00:37:05.149 --> 00:37:08.189
more interesting to, to your audience. Uh And you

608
00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:11.739
can therefore craft what uh people have called in

609
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:16.389
general literature of Super, um which are things that

610
00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:18.739
are always appealing to human minds, but that are

611
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.679
exaggerated in a certain direction that makes it very

612
00:37:22.689 --> 00:37:26.000
appealing to human minds. And I think the more

613
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.419
uh fictional the story is uh the more obvious

614
00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:31.510
it is that uh it's less relevant to, to

615
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.560
gather information that we need another explanation as to

616
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.729
why we, we consume them. Uh FOR instance, I

617
00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:41.000
think, uh of science, science fiction, a science fiction

618
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.010
writer is likely to trade the credibility of the

619
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.110
uh, of the information they deliver uh for its

620
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.260
potential in terms of pleasure they, they provide to

621
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.909
the audience in terms of entertainment that in fact,

622
00:37:54.389 --> 00:38:00.719
uh uh the invention and the exaggeration of uh

623
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.909
already apply.

624
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:07.840
Mhm. Yeah. It, it reminds me the entertainment hypothesis

625
00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.689
and what you mentioned there about it reminds me

626
00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:16.929
of Steven Pinker calling uh art uh mental cheesecake.

627
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.810
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly that, that's

628
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.860
the beginning of this. Uh I think uh Steven

629
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.989
Pinker uh uh ideas on this subject are at

630
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.439
the beginning of this uh of this uh of

631
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.889
this hypothesis. Yeah.

632
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.510
Mhm So we've been talking a lot about the

633
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.510
evolutionary foundations of fiction here and of course, uh

634
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.070
we have uh ultimate explanations but then we also

635
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.330
have proximate explanations and pro proximate mechanisms. So do

636
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.060
we know what are the proximate mechanisms that play

637
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.629
a role in fiction?

638
00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:04.370
Um uh Well, approximately uh I think it's uh

639
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.020
uh do, do, do dopamine system uh in the

640
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.830
brain, a t least uh that is, that seems

641
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.419
relevant because it's uh it's relevant for more generally

642
00:39:15.429 --> 00:39:18.000
in the, in the human mind. Uh As you

643
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.239
said, uh we can also uh again, uh mention

644
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.889
Pinker who called uh features uh fiction, uh pleasure,

645
00:39:25.899 --> 00:39:30.219
uh pleasure buttons. Uh So it's uh this proximal

646
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:33.560
mechanism that can be activated to, to provide pleasure

647
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.540
to the, to, to, to the other individuals. Uh

648
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.909
And uh as we have said, we have a

649
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:43.719
lot of approximate mechanisms that have evolved for specific,

650
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:47.729
for specific reasons unrelated to fiction. I think that

651
00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:51.520
can be uh pushed that can be activated, triggered

652
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.120
uh by your fictional stories. Uh Uh We, we

653
00:39:56.129 --> 00:40:03.939
already uh talked about uh fear. Uh We talked

654
00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:07.080
about Cloud about uh curiosity of it. Uh We

655
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.820
have uh uh in fact, uh a broad range

656
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:16.320
of proximate mechanisms uh whose uh function uh are

657
00:40:16.459 --> 00:40:19.629
sometimes more or less but are uh clear from

658
00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:22.260
an evolutionary point of view. Uh And which can

659
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.199
be uh which can be three. Yeah. Uh You

660
00:40:26.209 --> 00:40:30.489
had the specific uh um idea uh specific things

661
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.260
in mind when you talked about proximate mechanisms or

662
00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:37.239
uh no, not necessarily. I mean, in terms of

663
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.379
the proximate mechanisms, one of the things that came

664
00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:44.770
to mind was basically tin bes for questions where

665
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:49.939
two of them are basically about the ultimate explanations

666
00:40:49.949 --> 00:40:53.550
for behind the particular uh trait. In this case,

667
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.820
we're talking about the cognitive slash psychological trait. And

668
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.100
then the other two are about proximate explanations having

669
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.409
to do with development and so on. But uh

670
00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:08.229
I, I guess that you've already answered the question.

671
00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:11.169
So uh I have another thing that I would

672
00:41:11.179 --> 00:41:13.209
like to ask you about that. I also read

673
00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:17.479
about in your work that is imaginary worlds in

674
00:41:17.489 --> 00:41:21.969
fictional stories. So what are imaginary worlds

675
00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:27.239
exactly that uh the first uh the first part

676
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.520
of my phd, the first project that I uh

677
00:41:29.879 --> 00:41:33.760
that I did when I arrived in the Evolution

678
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.280
and Social Recognition Lab at the Ens in Paris.

679
00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:40.969
Uh We have worked with NMA on imaginary worlds

680
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.889
and we uh we define uh imaginary worlds as

681
00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.699
the uh the settings, the kind of settings in

682
00:41:47.709 --> 00:41:51.239
feature stories uh that are different uh from the

683
00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.449
real world, from real environments that we know in

684
00:41:54.459 --> 00:41:56.110
the real world. So you can think of uh

685
00:41:56.459 --> 00:41:59.000
the red line uh in one piece, for instance,

686
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.629
uh you can think of uh in the Harry

687
00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:07.530
Potter, you can think of the, of the universe

688
00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.139
and the universe, universe and all the planets in

689
00:42:11.149 --> 00:42:14.620
star wars uh where there was in Game of

690
00:42:14.629 --> 00:42:17.070
Thrones are there in a lot of anyway, we

691
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.320
have a lot of example of counterpart examples that

692
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.610
are actually really, really successful. That's what's one thing

693
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.929
that I can that, that brought me to this

694
00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:29.239
subject at first is that I realized that all

695
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:33.199
the fiction that personally I liked first, but also

696
00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:35.929
that seem to be liked uh uh like by

697
00:42:35.949 --> 00:42:39.610
a bunch of people around the world event. Uh

698
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.699
So these are all the first uh world fiction

699
00:42:43.709 --> 00:42:47.159
fiction that are really released in uh in almost

700
00:42:47.169 --> 00:42:50.639
all countries. And what is, what is specific to

701
00:42:50.649 --> 00:42:53.790
all these works is that uh there are places

702
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.429
that don't exist in the real world and that

703
00:42:56.439 --> 00:43:01.250
are perceptually or epistemic different from the real world.

704
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.629
So what key de determine, I think of the

705
00:43:03.639 --> 00:43:06.770
definition that we propose that is about the background

706
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:11.169
knowledge that is required to understand more broadly the

707
00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:15.260
fiction, the fiction story. So I imagine because imaginary

708
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.139
environment are the fictional environments that the receptions of

709
00:43:20.149 --> 00:43:22.699
the fiction could not have possibly explored in real

710
00:43:22.709 --> 00:43:27.939
life because they actually uh come from the mind

711
00:43:27.949 --> 00:43:30.030
of one individual, which is the creator of the

712
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.510
imaginary world. And actually, it gives also rise to,

713
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.540
to some uh fun culture specific uh culture related

714
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:42.219
uh uh behaviors and motivations. For instance, you can

715
00:43:42.229 --> 00:43:47.139
think of how fans uh uh like uh and

716
00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:51.979
uh uh Android uh faking fandoms that is online,

717
00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:55.129
uh you know, online encyclopedias about the worlds which

718
00:43:55.139 --> 00:43:58.540
are highly structured with a lot of information. And

719
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.780
uh that's something really uh interesting from a psychological

720
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.810
point of view, I think.

721
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.439
No. Yeah, that, that's, that's right. I'm aware of

722
00:44:06.449 --> 00:44:09.840
some of those online fandoms. And by the way,

723
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:13.169
let me just tell the audience that I if

724
00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:17.070
you're not familiar with one piece, you should become

725
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.409
familiar with it because actually, it's the second most

726
00:44:22.419 --> 00:44:27.719
sold uh comic in the history, be just behind

727
00:44:27.729 --> 00:44:33.699
Superman. It's already past the 500 million volume sold.

728
00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:38.000
So you should definitely get into it before it's

729
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.889
too late. So, but, but I guess we might

730
00:44:41.899 --> 00:44:43.750
come back to one piece later. So

731
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.070
if you think of uh we, we talked about

732
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.949
social just tosis, we talked about social functions before.

733
00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.750
That makes me think about the one thing that

734
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.090
uh I like to, to, to think about, about

735
00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.419
the social function of fiction is the opportunity, costs

736
00:45:00.429 --> 00:45:04.399
of not consuming something that is really spread out

737
00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:07.620
there. I think of some friends who didn't watch

738
00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:10.399
Game of Thrones and while the episodes were, were

739
00:45:10.409 --> 00:45:12.830
released, they were really uh they felt left out

740
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.219
actually and there is really a cost of not

741
00:45:15.229 --> 00:45:18.540
being interested. Uh I think uh in a, in

742
00:45:18.729 --> 00:45:22.959
a, in popular fiction because you miss soun good

743
00:45:22.969 --> 00:45:27.530
opportunities to bond actually. So funny how we, we,

744
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.179
we kind of recommend it because it is popular.

745
00:45:31.149 --> 00:45:31.729
Yeah.

746
00:45:31.739 --> 00:45:35.280
Right. But do we have any idea where this

747
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:39.659
fascination for imaginary worlds come from? I, I mean,

748
00:45:39.669 --> 00:45:42.709
I guess that in a sense part of the

749
00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:45.889
answer is already there in what you said, the

750
00:45:45.899 --> 00:45:49.409
social bonding and so on. But, uh I mean,

751
00:45:49.449 --> 00:45:52.600
at first sight, it seems a bit weird because

752
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:58.409
we're talking about nonexisting things that are many times

753
00:45:58.419 --> 00:46:02.169
probably not relevant at all to how we live

754
00:46:02.179 --> 00:46:05.580
our lives, to our real world. So, where does

755
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:06.479
it come from?

756
00:46:06.989 --> 00:46:11.310
Yeah, exactly. First of all, I think the social

757
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.080
functions are relevant just to explain how we use

758
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:18.360
fictions when we have uh consume them and like

759
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.879
them and enjoy the, enjoy, consuming them. But I

760
00:46:21.889 --> 00:46:25.139
don't think it explains the pleasure we have from

761
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:29.500
uh consuming them. I think it's uh it's like

762
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.669
a, a thing you can do after af after

763
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:35.139
what uh I think we need uh psychological uh

764
00:46:35.149 --> 00:46:40.780
specific psychological explanations of each of the, of the,

765
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.600
of the features in fiction that we uh that

766
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.600
we find attractive. And in fact, this is what

767
00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.100
we worked on with Nicola in two papers in

768
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:53.610
11 theoretical and one more. Uh And we propose

769
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.919
that imaginary words are appealing because they meet the

770
00:46:56.929 --> 00:47:02.090
input conditions uh of our community disposition geared toward

771
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:08.219
exploration um just as uh uh romances and tragedies,

772
00:47:08.229 --> 00:47:12.560
for instance, meet the input conditions of preference for

773
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:16.620
love or, or enjoyment of competition. And here I

774
00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:20.219
build on a 1st, 1st and cultural attraction theory

775
00:47:20.229 --> 00:47:23.270
by Dance Barber, but also of one paper that

776
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.550
I consider uh really uh important like kind of

777
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.250
seminar in this field, which is Daniel Net's paper

778
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.889
uh in 2004, The Wheel of Fire and the

779
00:47:33.899 --> 00:47:38.629
M line. Um So we uh which, which is

780
00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:42.129
about linking uh the appeal of some specific features

781
00:47:42.139 --> 00:47:46.790
in fiction and psychological dispositions and all. But this

782
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.969
is the author that imaginary world. Uh Our, our

783
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.560
appeal for imaginary world rely on our exploratory is

784
00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:58.290
driving us to motivating us to explore uh new

785
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.080
environments in the real world. And in fact, this

786
00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.449
is a, this comes from uh intuitions from the,

787
00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:08.020
from some creators of uh imaginary war themselves. I

788
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:11.209
like to quote uh Tolkien first who wrote uh

789
00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:14.899
in a, in a letter uh that part of

790
00:48:14.909 --> 00:48:17.159
the attraction of Lord of the Rings relies on

791
00:48:17.169 --> 00:48:19.409
the, on the same feeling you get when you're

792
00:48:19.419 --> 00:48:23.560
viewing uh far off. Uh I think it's the

793
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.939
towers of a, of a distant city. So you,

794
00:48:26.949 --> 00:48:28.969
you, you want to explore it since you see

795
00:48:28.979 --> 00:48:31.540
the towers, you want to explore it. And um

796
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.719
and she uh and uh uh Shigeru Miyamoto, uh

797
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.260
the creator of Zelda who said he wanted to

798
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.070
create a game world that conveyed the same feeling

799
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.629
you get when you arrive in a new city

800
00:48:43.639 --> 00:48:46.530
for the first time. So both captured the same

801
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.770
intuition that I think is really relevant here, which

802
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.729
is about you want to explore the world, you

803
00:48:51.739 --> 00:48:54.330
want to, to know what, what is going on,

804
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.300
uh how uh how it is uh organized, what

805
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.689
are the, the opportunities uh in this uh environment

806
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:07.620
style. So, um our, our hypothesis uh which relies

807
00:49:07.629 --> 00:49:11.399
on these intuitions and uh uh is equivalent to

808
00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:16.360
things that imaginary words are constitute AAA super stimulus

809
00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:22.489
of explorative real world environments. Or that uh to

810
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:28.179
take uh again, span terms uh that imaginary worlds

811
00:49:28.189 --> 00:49:31.300
are part of the actual domain uh of the

812
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:36.030
cognitive mechanism that evaluates the learning opportunities uh in,

813
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.310
in uh in landscapes inin uh environments as opposed

814
00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.580
to the proper domain, which is about the, the,

815
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:46.899
the, the, which co, which is consti constituted of

816
00:49:46.909 --> 00:49:49.649
uh the, the real stimuli that uh that uh

817
00:49:49.659 --> 00:49:53.449
triggers this mechanism. So here cues of uh real

818
00:49:53.459 --> 00:49:55.189
world uh exp environments.

819
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.129
Mhm. Uh So, I would imagine then that when

820
00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:03.139
it comes to these exploratory preferences, there would be

821
00:50:03.149 --> 00:50:07.219
inter individual differences in them, right? I mean, there

822
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:11.250
are probably people that are more prone to exploratory

823
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.669
behavior than others.

824
00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:20.600
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um The all the

825
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:26.699
all differences uh in people's preferences and uh behaviors

826
00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:30.199
uh I think is a matter of uh trade

827
00:50:30.209 --> 00:50:32.800
off uh that a re dealt with differently at

828
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.159
the level of the individual according to many factors,

829
00:50:36.169 --> 00:50:38.600
in fact. So it's, this is a hard question.

830
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.600
Uh The one that we try to iate of

831
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.570
course, but uh difficult. Uh So here's the relevant

832
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.870
trade off, the most relevant trade off on the

833
00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.360
as a, as even a name, which is the

834
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:56.139
exploration exploitation head off. So it means why and

835
00:50:56.149 --> 00:51:01.540
where uh should organisms uh decide to explore or

836
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:06.820
not to explore that is to exploit because lots

837
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.820
of, lots of animals have exploratory preferences uh have

838
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:15.350
to go beyond uh what they know uh have

839
00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.030
to go in into unknown territories. So, in our

840
00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.800
paper, we argue that uh that sources of adaptive

841
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:28.810
variability, explain the differences in people's motivation to explore

842
00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.510
uh the real world. And therefore, imaginary worlds. And

843
00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.689
we therefore predict that exploratory preferences and the preference

844
00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:41.219
for imaginary world would, could vary uh simply. And

845
00:51:41.229 --> 00:51:44.350
uh we actually provided evidence uh for that in

846
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:49.540
uh two studies uh with correlations between measures of

847
00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:54.429
curiosity or openness or, or facets of openness and

848
00:51:54.439 --> 00:51:58.320
the robotic preference for uh fictional studies set uh

849
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:02.800
set me worlds uh those that develop a full,

850
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.189
full, I imagine. Uh But we also predict that

851
00:52:07.199 --> 00:52:11.820
um factors of attraction that explain uh the viability

852
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.100
in explanatory preferences in the real world uh should

853
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.229
explain the preference for imaginary ones. And she often

854
00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:21.530
understand that uh uh there seem to be a

855
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:27.659
universal and adaptive uh source availability uh in development.

856
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.149
Uh There is evidence evidence from uh there is

857
00:52:31.159 --> 00:52:35.080
evidence from uh experimental on developmental psychology that shows

858
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.429
that uh Children uh explore more than adults in

859
00:52:38.439 --> 00:52:42.060
a lot of tasks and uh other kind of

860
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:47.419
measurements. Um And this is consistent with evolutionary theory

861
00:52:47.429 --> 00:52:51.350
which proposes that this is a big exploration is

862
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.610
more to Children because it's uh Children have more

863
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.560
to, to learn from the world. And uh there

864
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.100
is another reason uh according to me, uh which

865
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.699
is that humans uh in humans, like in many

866
00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:07.760
animals and uh and many, especially mammals that is

867
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:15.120
parental investment. Uh MEANING that uh parents transfer resources

868
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:20.260
to Children and therefore Children can afford to explore

869
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:24.060
without even if they, if they, if they don't

870
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:27.090
find, if they don't discover anything valuable right now.

871
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.060
They can afford to lose some resources or time

872
00:53:30.169 --> 00:53:32.310
because they have transferred from the pound. So we

873
00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.510
can afford to, to explore more because uh because

874
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.489
we have uh we have, we have a species

875
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.989
with po and investment. Um And I think this

876
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.810
can expand, for instance, uh why we see many

877
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.750
uh fictional stories for Children uh set uh in

878
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.750
uh in such imaginary worlds such as uh you

879
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.909
can think of uh Wonderland in Alice, in Wonderland

880
00:53:54.919 --> 00:54:00.659
of Neverland, in Peter Po uh of Coco uh

881
00:54:00.879 --> 00:54:05.840
up. Uh I don't know how you um un

882
00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:09.590
world. I know all the Disney movies, but almost

883
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.919
all Disney movies are, are set in a, in

884
00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:13.729
a world that is different from the real world.

885
00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:18.939
And it's really a uh striking and um we

886
00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:24.199
also talk about all other sources of availability in

887
00:54:24.209 --> 00:54:26.459
uh in the, in the preference for imaginable. And

888
00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:29.830
uh we can consider understand also the ecology. So

889
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.860
in humans and much like in other animals, you

890
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.560
have uh a variability in the preference for exploration

891
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:39.469
uh that is explained by the environment because this

892
00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:44.129
mechanism is very plastic. Uh MEANING that uh organisms

893
00:54:44.139 --> 00:54:48.030
uh have evolved in a way to calibrate this

894
00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:53.409
uh preference for exploration uh open city to explore

895
00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:58.159
uh two characteristics of the environments. Uh Notably, environments,

896
00:54:58.169 --> 00:55:00.770
exploration is very risky because if you don't find

897
00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:06.219
uh anything, you, you, you lose uh what you

898
00:55:06.229 --> 00:55:08.820
have not found you, you, you, you describe those

899
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.010
things. So it's risky and it's costly because when

900
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.800
you are doing that, you're not doing, you're not

901
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:17.370
expecting your resources uh that you, that, that you

902
00:55:17.379 --> 00:55:20.689
can export. So when you delay the collection of

903
00:55:20.699 --> 00:55:24.270
a resource to go, to go explore, you lose

904
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.790
the benefits of uh that you would have generated

905
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.110
if you were expecting. So this is the opportunity

906
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.120
cost. Um So with this uh or rationale, uh

907
00:55:34.129 --> 00:55:39.639
we, we explain uh the uh why uh we

908
00:55:39.649 --> 00:55:42.649
try to propose an explanation as to why imaginary

909
00:55:42.659 --> 00:55:46.540
worlds are increasing in modern societies. They are increasing,

910
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.989
I think in number uh as a share of

911
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.350
literary works or movies that are set in imaginary

912
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.239
worlds uh increase relative to the whole production. But

913
00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:59.320
they also seem to increase in uh in size

914
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:03.229
or depth or complexity, let's say, as they include

915
00:56:03.239 --> 00:56:06.590
more and more information that follows to, to better

916
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.320
grasp uh the world itself. Um And we are

917
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:13.040
actually working on a project uh that tries to,

918
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:16.060
to, to just that, that is the evolution, the

919
00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.399
evolution of the size of worlds, for instance, from

920
00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:23.620
islands to continents, to planets, to entire universes. You

921
00:56:23.629 --> 00:56:25.969
know, you know, we have uh we have uh

922
00:56:25.979 --> 00:56:28.719
universes with a bunch of planets and makes me

923
00:56:28.729 --> 00:56:30.780
think of uh no man sky, the video games

924
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.959
where you have uh even uh computer generated uh

925
00:56:34.969 --> 00:56:40.090
uh computationally uh computationally generated planets which uh see

926
00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.169
the in uh as you, as you explore, so

927
00:56:43.179 --> 00:56:46.979
you get to, to explore an infinite universe. Uh

928
00:56:48.449 --> 00:56:51.370
No, no. And, and I guess that also very

929
00:56:51.379 --> 00:56:56.389
much manifests in like for example, a song of

930
00:56:56.399 --> 00:56:58.669
ice and fire and one piece, I mean, these

931
00:56:58.679 --> 00:57:02.500
are massive worlds, even if it's just one planet,

932
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:06.320
it's really massive and extremely detailed. But uh I

933
00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:08.510
mean, when it comes to that, do you already

934
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.469
have any uh hypothesis on the table to potentially

935
00:57:13.479 --> 00:57:18.229
explain why there's been that expansion in terms of

936
00:57:18.239 --> 00:57:21.429
the number of imaginary worlds we have now in

937
00:57:21.439 --> 00:57:23.709
our culture and so on.

938
00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:28.899
Uh Yeah, it's um the explanation, the explanation would

939
00:57:28.909 --> 00:57:32.389
be that since this mechanism is plastic to uh

940
00:57:32.399 --> 00:57:36.530
resource availability, if you have more resources available around

941
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.169
you, you uh you can afford to be more

942
00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:42.360
expressive because uh you, you're riskless and you have

943
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.870
more benefits. Also, you have more benefits because the

944
00:57:44.879 --> 00:57:48.469
information you get from exploration is actually variable in

945
00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:50.850
the future. So you need a long time reason

946
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.520
to, to think that it's valuable to explore. You

947
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.189
need to think that the information you will get

948
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:59.129
will be uh valuable for a long time. So

949
00:57:59.139 --> 00:58:03.030
your time reason kind of immediate uh the the

950
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:09.010
the kind of uh determinate the importance that you,

951
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.000
the values that you, that you, that you get,

952
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.510
that you, that you think is uh uh the

953
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:22.100
information. Uh So basically because of all that um

954
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:29.340
um you can uh explain uh the uh emergence

955
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:32.939
and uh rise of I imagine I want with

956
00:58:32.949 --> 00:58:37.830
the increase in uh in resources in uh modern

957
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.860
societies, I uh you can get proxy which is

958
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.020
just an approximation of some other measures that would

959
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.939
be also relevant to explain how people feel safe

960
00:58:47.959 --> 00:58:50.729
about the amount of resources that they, that they

961
00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:53.540
have in their environments. But one proxy which is

962
00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:57.189
more simple to measure is GDP, uh which uh

963
00:58:57.199 --> 00:59:03.100
rise in every modern uh developed uh industrialized societies,

964
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.580
which are the societies in which you have a

965
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:08.020
lot of images that are being created and more

966
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:12.040
and more of them. Um So uh the expansion

967
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:14.639
that we, that we uh that we propose with

968
00:59:14.649 --> 00:59:19.679
Nicola Boar is that uh the, the change, the

969
00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:23.090
changes in uh the ecology in our ecology which

970
00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.489
are really manifest in the last uh decades or

971
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:31.139
centuries. Um Can you explain the changes in uh

972
00:59:31.149 --> 00:59:34.419
the, the popularity of imaginary worlds? Mhm

973
00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.580
No. Yeah. It, it makes sense and I have

974
00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:41.260
a couple of follow up questions to, well, uh

975
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:44.330
all of what you just said there. So uh

976
00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.419
I would imagine, I, I hope this is a

977
00:59:46.429 --> 00:59:48.889
fair question because I'm not sure if you are

978
00:59:48.899 --> 00:59:53.629
very much into uh personality psychology or not. But

979
00:59:53.639 --> 00:59:57.620
since we're talking about uh an, an individual trait

980
00:59:57.629 --> 01:00:00.229
here, uh I just wanted to ask you this.

981
01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:03.479
So, uh do you have any idea if a

982
01:00:03.489 --> 01:00:10.850
preference for exploratory behavior would correlate with particular personality

983
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.770
traits. Like, for example, in the big five openness

984
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.260
to experience or extroversion. For example, do you have

985
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.760
any idea about that? Yeah,

986
01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.899
we actually, in, uh, in our uh empirical paper,

987
01:00:23.909 --> 01:00:27.239
we tested that specifically. We, uh uh we tested

988
01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:32.129
that both with uh um uh big data set

989
01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:36.330
of, uh, of, of personality traits that are associated

990
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.949
with specific movies. Like you, you had a data

991
01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:43.000
set that was released with 3.5 million people who

992
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:47.479
liked some movies on the internet, on Facebook and

993
01:00:47.489 --> 01:00:50.540
uh their traits. And uh and we, we have

994
01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.830
a negre data set of this and we could

995
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.840
uh we use the random algorithm to detect which

996
01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:59.100
of these movies are set in an imaginary world.

997
01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:02.040
So we try to add to, to, to, to

998
01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.239
specify which uh which to find, to select which

999
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.260
movies are actually uh set in such a world.

1000
01:01:08.649 --> 01:01:11.110
And we did correlation and we found that we

1001
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.719
had predicted and found that uh uh people who

1002
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:17.620
enjoy this world are higher in openness to experiments,

1003
01:01:17.629 --> 01:01:20.290
which is as you as, as you, as you

1004
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.669
predict, you know, and which is a measure of

1005
01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.629
uh which can be sort of as a measure

1006
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:29.260
of curiosity of an levels of curs and it's

1007
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:35.459
actually uh negatively correlated with extraversion. So this is

1008
01:01:35.469 --> 01:01:39.010
another something that we didn't expect, but we, that

1009
01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.979
we didn't predict, we just wanted to look at

1010
01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:46.669
the, at the at the openness trade, which uh

1011
01:01:46.679 --> 01:01:49.370
I think the most relevant here. And uh we

1012
01:01:49.379 --> 01:01:52.300
found we, we, we replicated that with an experiment

1013
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:56.360
as a correlation with uh with um people uh

1014
01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:00.659
who were being asked to do five. And uh

1015
01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:04.780
we uh they had to report their own preference

1016
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.520
for uh fiction, fictional stories in uh images and

1017
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.689
we found the same correlation. So, yeah, uh I'm

1018
01:02:11.699 --> 01:02:15.010
really interested in this uh in, in, in the

1019
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:19.409
associations between certain uh d five traits. Let's say

1020
01:02:19.419 --> 01:02:23.270
you, let's say personality trades, but we talk, we

1021
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.120
talk about the big five here and uh and

1022
01:02:26.129 --> 01:02:30.510
the the liking and the enjoyment of the specific

1023
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.550
fiction, fictional stories. And I think it's really, really

1024
01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.810
important to, to, to do that, to try to,

1025
01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.219
to, to better understand the fictional stories. We need

1026
01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:41.780
to understand why some people like them, but some

1027
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.010
people don't actually.

1028
01:02:44.459 --> 01:02:48.050
Yeah. And I guess that in terms of let's

1029
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.159
say real life behavior in industrialized and post industrial

1030
01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:58.209
societies, apart from people that score higher in exploratory

1031
01:02:58.219 --> 01:03:02.959
behavior, being more prone to liking this sort of

1032
01:03:02.969 --> 01:03:06.314
uh fiction that would also in terms of the

1033
01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:09.094
real life behavior. These would also be people that

1034
01:03:09.354 --> 01:03:13.435
for example, would also like to travel more live

1035
01:03:13.445 --> 01:03:17.975
in different places, experience or try different kinds of

1036
01:03:17.985 --> 01:03:21.614
food and different kinds of things out there. Right.

1037
01:03:22.054 --> 01:03:25.425
Exactly. You, this is exactly the kind of prediction

1038
01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:27.294
that we we would make in fact, the whole

1039
01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.540
cluster of behaviors that are associated with open two

1040
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.790
experiments would be, should be associated with the construction

1041
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.760
of imaginary words. So we have uh we, we,

1042
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.000
we are, we could make all the prediction that

1043
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.419
you have just made and uh try to test

1044
01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:45.719
them one after the other with the uh the

1045
01:03:45.729 --> 01:03:50.179
limit of the uh the risk uh that uh

1046
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:54.590
we might expect that the consumption of the imaginary

1047
01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.689
world. Uh uh IT could be uh could, could

1048
01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:05.290
replace some other activities that uh that, that people

1049
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.550
had in openness to experience uh would have uh

1050
01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.629
performed before. Uh THEY were uh imaginary was in

1051
01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:15.969
the, in the landscape. Uh I, I talk here

1052
01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:19.489
of a kind of substitution effect where uh people

1053
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:23.840
who would be uh high in expression uh would

1054
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.919
uh uh should read for instance, uh uh travel

1055
01:04:27.929 --> 01:04:35.899
literature or uh or historical or novels or, but

1056
01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:39.860
in fact, if there is something that uh like

1057
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:42.959
imaginary words will charge super stimuli of, of this,

1058
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.929
we should expect that in fact, I should uh

1059
01:04:44.939 --> 01:04:48.820
stop consuming that for, for imaginary words. So we,

1060
01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.699
this is where it's begin, it's beginning to be

1061
01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:56.520
tricky to make prediction because we, we uh we,

1062
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:59.280
we still expect people who, who like imaginary words

1063
01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:02.360
to travel more, but they should travel less if

1064
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.399
they consume more imaginary words, you know, you know

1065
01:05:04.409 --> 01:05:05.030
what I mean?

1066
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.479
No. Yeah. So, so in that particular case, if

1067
01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:12.899
you're right. Then some people, at least after they

1068
01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:17.120
start reading a Game of Thrones would prefer that

1069
01:05:17.129 --> 01:05:21.600
to, then just historical novels or even history books

1070
01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:26.000
because probably the Life of Daenerys Targaryen is more

1071
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:27.899
interesting then. Char May. No.

1072
01:05:30.129 --> 01:05:33.899
Exactly. And uh and our, our, our time is

1073
01:05:33.909 --> 01:05:36.129
limited. It's a budget. That's uh it's uh it's

1074
01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.810
the whole thing behind the trade offs and we

1075
01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.739
have limited budget of time. So uh we need

1076
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.290
to allocate the time uh in the, in the

1077
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.760
manners that we find the, the more relevant. And

1078
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.260
here the is, is uh I think uh uh

1079
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:53.229
a good uh exa mples of the supers stim.

1080
01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:59.320
So uh I, I mean, these inter individual differences

1081
01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:04.530
would then also explain according to your hypothesis why

1082
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.820
certain people love, for example, in terms of genres,

1083
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:13.110
uh fantasy stories and science fiction and other people,

1084
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.260
not that much, right?

1085
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:18.409
In terms of uh genre mean of the gens

1086
01:06:18.489 --> 01:06:19.149
of people.

1087
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:23.330
Uh No, the genres, the fictional genres out there.

1088
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:27.439
I mean, I was referring here to specifically fantasy

1089
01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:29.629
stories and science fiction.

1090
01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:34.860
So, yeah, but science fiction and 20 yeah, are,

1091
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.770
are the kind of works where there, there are

1092
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.120
uh uh I imagine I want uh I think

1093
01:06:42.129 --> 01:06:45.199
of uh actually, I think of genres are as

1094
01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:49.479
um as the four categories like categories that people

1095
01:06:49.489 --> 01:06:54.870
make because uh it's, it's efficient to, to navigate

1096
01:06:54.879 --> 01:06:58.010
uh book uh bookstores and uh and streaming platforms.

1097
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:03.310
It's uh categories that are really uh useful. Um

1098
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.010
And I do think that the, the, we, we

1099
01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.699
predict the same uh individual chances in the preference

1100
01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:14.679
for specific features and the preference for where these

1101
01:07:14.689 --> 01:07:18.550
features are predominant. Um So we just to make

1102
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.550
it clear, uh I uh in the, in the

1103
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.600
paper uh that I've been refering to a t

1104
01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:26.120
the beginning of our discussion, the papers, a t

1105
01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:28.810
least many medic mechanisms and many features of fiction

1106
01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:31.669
that a re associated to them. We record such

1107
01:07:31.719 --> 01:07:36.459
uh features in fiction that tap into specific cognitive

1108
01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:40.800
mechanism, ingredients and uh it's kind of a metaphor.

1109
01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.110
Uh I and I prefer to stay at this

1110
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.280
level of analysis of ingredients of uh of, of

1111
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:52.070
specific features that are uh that are that trigger

1112
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:57.989
psychological mechanisms and not uh to broad. Uh And

1113
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.469
again, we choose this energy because it's here, it's

1114
01:08:01.479 --> 01:08:03.629
a good energy I think because to understand which

1115
01:08:03.639 --> 01:08:08.419
recipes people enjoy uh in prisoner, you'd better understand

1116
01:08:08.429 --> 01:08:11.040
which ingredients they like and why and not the

1117
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:14.199
whole recipe. Because you, you, you, you lose some

1118
01:08:14.209 --> 01:08:17.490
information. For instance, I like to take some example

1119
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.560
in movies. For instance, if you think of uh

1120
01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:23.290
why people like Harry Potter, if you take the

1121
01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:27.469
information, that is just a fantastic book, uh You,

1122
01:08:27.758 --> 01:08:31.127
you lose a lot of uh information about other

1123
01:08:31.139 --> 01:08:35.238
ingredients. Uh Notably one major ingredients I think is

1124
01:08:35.249 --> 01:08:39.448
the investigation that is uh uh developed in all

1125
01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:41.877
the books, the first book is even uh kind

1126
01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:43.929
of good on it. Uh You, you have to

1127
01:08:43.938 --> 01:08:46.938
know who it is but uh but that is

1128
01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:51.587
never cat as a uh detective book or detective

1129
01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:54.179
movie and you lose a lot of information while

1130
01:08:54.188 --> 01:08:58.750
not uh trying to, to disentangle all the specific

1131
01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.899
parts in this fiction that are uh activating uh

1132
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:06.700
many, many uh psychological preferences. So that's uh the

1133
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:11.160
kind of uh uh I think uh the, the

1134
01:09:11.169 --> 01:09:14.160
research I'm trying to, to do the research projects,

1135
01:09:14.169 --> 01:09:18.649
I'm trying to develop uh he's uh a kind

1136
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:24.399
of uh I should uh is a kind of

1137
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.359
uh reputation of jobs as a, as a category

1138
01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:30.339
that is useful in research, at least because we

1139
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:32.640
lose too much information.

1140
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.669
Yeah. Mhm No, no, I, I get it, I

1141
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.859
get it. But with that framework in mind, when

1142
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:44.220
it comes to specific features or specific cognitive mechanisms

1143
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:49.379
that would play a role in uh evaluating different

1144
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:52.339
kinds of stories, do you think that you would

1145
01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:56.160
be able to have a better understanding of why?

1146
01:09:56.169 --> 01:10:00.240
For example, according to the features of the stories,

1147
01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:04.529
certain people would tend to prefer, let's say love

1148
01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:09.120
stories and others, horror stories and so on.

1149
01:10:10.509 --> 01:10:13.640
Yeah, I think so. Uh I think we, we

1150
01:10:13.649 --> 01:10:18.089
would have to. So there is a whole um

1151
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.330
research program that, that, that, that should be shared

1152
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:25.270
with this framework and with this idea, uh which

1153
01:10:25.279 --> 01:10:27.560
is, which is which has already started and we

1154
01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:31.189
would just uh try to, to bring together this

1155
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.580
framework. But uh people, again, people at the rec

1156
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:40.419
and are already working on uh uh differences in

1157
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:44.580
the performance for or for instance. Um AND there

1158
01:10:44.589 --> 01:10:46.419
a re a lot of papers being uh released

1159
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:51.209
uh like every week or every month about that.

1160
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:55.100
Uh But this is the idea, uh uh the

1161
01:10:55.109 --> 01:10:58.200
idea is that if you better understand uh the

1162
01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:04.089
specific ingredients, you uh and amount of their importance

1163
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.810
in a, in a set, in a given story,

1164
01:11:06.819 --> 01:11:11.149
you can uh better uh understand why uh who

1165
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.419
you, who would like this, this fictional story and

1166
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:17.759
why. And um this is where you need a

1167
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:21.339
good operationalization of each ingredient. You need to be

1168
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:24.750
able to, to measure them in a uh in

1169
01:11:24.759 --> 01:11:27.750
a quantitative way. And this is where we try

1170
01:11:27.759 --> 01:11:30.779
to propose methods to do that uh with Valentine

1171
01:11:30.839 --> 01:11:34.290
to Colma. So my, my collaborators at the moment

1172
01:11:34.299 --> 01:11:37.589
of all these projects where we try to propose

1173
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.720
um ways to uh measure ingredients infection. Uh So

1174
01:11:42.729 --> 01:11:45.950
as to be able to list all uh the,

1175
01:11:46.399 --> 01:11:49.750
the ingredients that are uh important in a, in

1176
01:11:49.759 --> 01:11:52.609
a given fiction and try to make predictions based

1177
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.509
on that. That's right. Mhm

1178
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.060
No, no, I, I get it. I get it.

1179
01:11:58.069 --> 01:12:02.220
I understand that uh the way we use, we

1180
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:06.600
use genres or classify different fictional stories in terms

1181
01:12:06.609 --> 01:12:10.220
of genres. I mean, it, they are very broad

1182
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:14.479
and many times ambiguous categories that might include many

1183
01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:18.634
different uh features that might apply in the story

1184
01:12:18.645 --> 01:12:21.104
and not in other. And for example, you might

1185
01:12:21.115 --> 01:12:25.854
have a, a crime story that also includes love

1186
01:12:25.865 --> 01:12:30.064
elements and horror, horror elements. And I mean, any

1187
01:12:30.075 --> 01:12:34.765
other kind of uh let's say, mix of ingredients,

1188
01:12:34.794 --> 01:12:35.254
right?

1189
01:12:35.555 --> 01:12:39.279
Um It's kind of the uh the same uh

1190
01:12:39.759 --> 01:12:43.290
uh the same. Uh HOW do you say a

1191
01:12:43.299 --> 01:12:46.979
step that um that uh that we did the

1192
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:50.970
personality researchers when the, the the they went from

1193
01:12:50.979 --> 01:12:55.399
a category categorical perspective, trying to put people in

1194
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.700
boxes, you, you uh to uh to a to

1195
01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:03.040
two dimensional approach where you instead, you, you, you,

1196
01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:07.129
you associate with each individual, multiple dimension and therefore

1197
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.890
you have a, you have an in it uh

1198
01:13:10.009 --> 01:13:12.600
not an engine but uh uh very, very, very

1199
01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:16.049
broad combination of different traits. And here we, I

1200
01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.189
think it's a good uh comparison. We try to,

1201
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:22.060
to go from uh genres which are categories in

1202
01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:24.479
which you put with this to uh a lot

1203
01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:28.040
of dimensions. Uh Ingredients are each, each ingredient is

1204
01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:31.729
a dimension where people score high or low. And

1205
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.890
you can therefore have a prac particularly infinite combination

1206
01:13:35.899 --> 01:13:38.890
of ingredients, which is really more subtle and uh

1207
01:13:38.899 --> 01:13:42.620
I think more uh uh will be more predictive

1208
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:45.569
and more interesting uh to study. Yeah.

1209
01:13:46.279 --> 01:13:48.600
Uh Yeah. And I guess that also when it

1210
01:13:48.609 --> 01:13:53.589
comes to the structure of um, personality traits then

1211
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.930
it's not only the trait but you also have

1212
01:13:55.939 --> 01:13:58.580
the facet and so on, like, in the big

1213
01:13:58.589 --> 01:14:01.520
five, I mean, two facets for each trait and

1214
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:03.459
so on and so forth. I mean, you can

1215
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:07.459
break it down into, uh, a finer or, uh,

1216
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.220
I mean, into, uh, finer details.

1217
01:14:11.259 --> 01:14:14.080
Right. Yeah, exactly. That would be, we could really,

1218
01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:16.850
uh, go, that's the, that's the direction and, uh,

1219
01:14:16.859 --> 01:14:20.450
I hope that it will uh it will get

1220
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.689
some of his rules and uh and that we

1221
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.169
can continue in this direction, but I'm really hopeful

1222
01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.000
about this direction.

1223
01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:30.629
Mhm So we've talked here a lot about inter

1224
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:37.080
individual differences. What about cross-cultural differences? Are you also

1225
01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:40.870
interested in that? And are there lots of cross

1226
01:14:40.879 --> 01:14:44.470
cultural differences that we know of in terms of

1227
01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:48.549
uh fiction, fiction preferences and so on?

1228
01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:52.509
Yeah, there are, there are cross cultural differences, cross

1229
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.600
differences. And we started to tackle uh that when

1230
01:14:56.609 --> 01:15:01.580
we talked about uh a viability in the preferences

1231
01:15:01.589 --> 01:15:06.629
of specific fictional features uh according to local ecologies,

1232
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:09.609
uh behavioral ecology is about uh trying to find

1233
01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.740
uh how changes in uh in uh in ecological

1234
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:18.399
factors uh explain uh changes in behaviors. So, of

1235
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:22.000
course, there is a uh one kind of uh

1236
01:15:22.009 --> 01:15:25.810
explanation. Uh And if in fact, before I started

1237
01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:28.899
uh uh to work in community science, I used

1238
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:32.009
to believe that cross cultural differences were due to

1239
01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:36.830
a combination of uh uh slightly different starting points

1240
01:15:36.839 --> 01:15:40.500
and a kind of past dependence due to our

1241
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:45.359
our evolution through social transmission and uh small small

1242
01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:48.870
changes. But I think this explanation, in fact, uh

1243
01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:52.759
I've come to learn that doesn't explain why within

1244
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.750
the same country and within sometimes the same group

1245
01:15:55.759 --> 01:15:57.709
of people from the same country, from the same

1246
01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.500
city, you also find variations that are often comparable

1247
01:16:01.509 --> 01:16:04.370
to those between countries and cultures. So this isn't

1248
01:16:04.379 --> 01:16:07.370
uh this doesn't seem to fit the, the, the

1249
01:16:07.379 --> 01:16:09.319
data at the individual level. So I think we

1250
01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:15.020
need to, to, to, to acknowledge the, the correspondence

1251
01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:19.899
between an individual differences and cross uh cross country

1252
01:16:19.919 --> 01:16:22.299
differences. And so now, I believe that in fact,

1253
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:26.799
such uh cross cultural differences can mostly be explained

1254
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:30.180
by differences in ecological conditions being be it uh

1255
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:34.759
resource availability. Uh I don't know, climate or pathogen

1256
01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:38.240
uh prevalence or, or sex ratio, you have a

1257
01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:42.009
lot of things that uh that, that vary between

1258
01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.919
countries actually and that, that we know have a

1259
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:48.319
causal effect on our psychology. So I think by

1260
01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.379
acknowledging this past, you can at the end uh

1261
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:54.310
following a framework at the end, uh try to

1262
01:16:54.319 --> 01:16:59.720
understand why there are differences between countries in what

1263
01:16:59.729 --> 01:17:02.279
uh in what they they enjoy as fiction stories

1264
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:05.819
and what they produce. Uh So I think this

1265
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.939
is the direction that uh that I would uh

1266
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:11.799
that I try to, to investigate uh in my

1267
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.569
uh in my project, uh not beyond iag worlds

1268
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.919
uh that the cost of society differences in the

1269
01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:22.759
preference for such fiction can in fact be explained

1270
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.160
by differences in uh ecological factors.

1271
01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.319
Mhm. Uh And those ecological factors would play a

1272
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:33.839
role in the specific content as well. That is

1273
01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:38.040
part of the fictional stories, right? I mean, per

1274
01:17:38.049 --> 01:17:42.109
perhaps there are certain features of the particular ecology

1275
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.450
that people live in that would also manifest in

1276
01:17:46.459 --> 01:17:50.919
the content of their own uh fictional stories,

1277
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:55.950
right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Here, I meant

1278
01:17:55.959 --> 01:17:58.029
to imagine I want in the, in the strict

1279
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.350
sense that means uh uh the setting of the

1280
01:18:02.359 --> 01:18:04.839
world that is uh that is different from the

1281
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:09.589
real world. But uh yeah, uh there are a

1282
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.229
lot of uh as I said, uh we use

1283
01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.350
the term ingredients, there are a lot of different

1284
01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:17.609
ingredients in different stories uh When you consider cross

1285
01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:23.259
cultural patterns and uh and people can enjoy uh

1286
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:27.580
all stories for very different reasons. And therefore you

1287
01:18:27.589 --> 01:18:34.970
need to understand the how eco ecological characteristics influence

1288
01:18:34.979 --> 01:18:38.759
each uh psychological mechanisms that might be uh uh

1289
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:43.549
responsible for uh the lacking of each specific intelligence.

1290
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.779
So it's becoming to be uh uh in uh

1291
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:49.160
in our collaborative paper, the one I mentioned at

1292
01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:52.930
the beginning and then a bit later, uh we,

1293
01:18:52.939 --> 01:18:56.759
we try to, to, to associate each uh mechanism

1294
01:18:56.770 --> 01:19:02.160
with, with uh some uh um uh some, some

1295
01:19:02.169 --> 01:19:05.890
sources of addictive variability that have been demonstrated in

1296
01:19:05.899 --> 01:19:09.240
the literature or, or proposed at least. And uh

1297
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:13.240
therefore, it makes a lot of prediction about what

1298
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.439
kind of ingredients are like in which ecologies. And

1299
01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.589
this is, this is a research program that uh

1300
01:19:19.759 --> 01:19:22.259
I think which we, we, we should uh we

1301
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:25.439
should continue to, to validate this remark. Mhm

1302
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:29.270
OK. So uh I have one final question and

1303
01:19:29.279 --> 01:19:32.580
actually this is probably the most important question of

1304
01:19:32.589 --> 01:19:37.229
our interview here today. So who is the better

1305
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.720
character? Sanji or Zuru?

1306
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:46.600
I was beginning to be stressed about the beginning

1307
01:19:46.609 --> 01:19:51.529
of the question. And the um now

1308
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.479
you, you know that this is the most debated

1309
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.500
question among the one community.

1310
01:19:57.509 --> 01:20:00.729
So I think you can actually uh try to

1311
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.629
propose a, we can actually try to propose an

1312
01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.000
answer according to the anti differences in personality of,

1313
01:20:07.009 --> 01:20:10.020
of uh of fans that, that they will not

1314
01:20:10.029 --> 01:20:11.990
like the same characters because they have not the

1315
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.200
same uh preference for some specific characteristics of people

1316
01:20:16.209 --> 01:20:18.709
they like to cooper with. And we could uh

1317
01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:21.319
we could list all the mechanisms that are related

1318
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:25.850
to uh people evaluation like uh pro force analysis,

1319
01:20:25.979 --> 01:20:29.149
uh competent, etcetera and try to find which uh

1320
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.689
which corresponds to which this is a really good

1321
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.700
research program, right?

1322
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.120
00 OK. But I, I do, I want an

1323
01:20:37.129 --> 01:20:40.390
answer here, send your or come on.

1324
01:20:40.439 --> 01:20:43.490
Uh I uh prefer Z

1325
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.529
Yeah, I, I'm on your side. So I guess,

1326
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:51.189
I guess now I can say that I have

1327
01:20:51.200 --> 01:21:00.759
uh academic support to my preference. Ok. So Edgar

1328
01:21:00.879 --> 01:21:03.729
look, uh, just before we go, would you like

1329
01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.359
to tell people where they can find you and

1330
01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:08.200
your work on the internet? Uh

1331
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:13.709
Yes. Um, WELL, I have a website, uh which

1332
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.439
is uh uh www dot Edgar Jor. Uh So

1333
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:22.750
my first name, last name, uh or you can

1334
01:21:22.759 --> 01:21:25.229
find me on Twitter and I have all the,

1335
01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.299
all my publications on my website. So I think

1336
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:30.629
that's it. Uh Yeah.

1337
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:33.819
Ok, great. So I'm leaving links to it in

1338
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:36.100
to that in the description box of the interview.

1339
01:21:36.109 --> 01:21:38.500
And thank you so much again for taking the

1340
01:21:38.509 --> 01:21:40.089
