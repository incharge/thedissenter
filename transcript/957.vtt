00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.449
the Center. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs and the

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.810
MG by Doctor Adam Tun. He is Associate Professor

4
00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.649
of Philosophy at the University of Exeter and Deputy

5
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.130
Director at Agents, the Center for the Study of

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.989
Life Sciences. And today we're talking about his book

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.579
Mind as metaphor, a defense of mental fictional. So,

8
00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.870
Doctor Tun, welcome to the show. It's a big

9
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:26.969
pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.270
Thank you. Thank you very much for inviting me.

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.599
So, since we're talking about the mind here today,

12
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.790
and of course, as the subtitle suggests, we're going

13
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.409
to try to defend a mental fictional list position

14
00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:46.330
here today. But uh of course, there's several different

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.229
ideas that people have about the mind. Some of

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.825
them come from more, let's say common people, uh

17
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.744
the common folk and others from philosophers. But starting

18
00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.384
with the more common ones, there's this idea of

19
00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:04.694
folk psychology, what is it and how does it

20
00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:08.425
apply in the context of what you're exploring in

21
00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.105
your book?

22
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.230
Yeah. Thank you. Um The, you, you, it's surprisingly

23
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:17.360
difficult to say exactly what folk psychology is, which

24
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.599
is, which is strange given that it's supposed to

25
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.690
be something we know, uh, very well. Um, SO,

26
00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:26.230
so roughly speaking, it's supposed to be the sort

27
00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:30.279
of, um, common sense understanding of the mind that

28
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.910
we're all employing every day. Um, USUALLY without thinking

29
00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:37.500
about it, um, when we say things like someone

30
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.440
wants a cup of coffee or, uh, they think

31
00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:43.699
the meeting is in such and such a room

32
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.330
or they hope that, um, they'll get a pay

33
00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.099
rise next year or what have you in, in

34
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.569
other words, the thought is simply that, um, we

35
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.870
in a sense know an awful lot about the

36
00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.900
mind in our everyday life. Um, AND the sense

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.860
in which we know that is we're very good

38
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.430
at using, um, l a whole set of um,

39
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.508
terms to describe uh the minds of others and

40
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.539
ourselves, like, uh wanting and hoping and fearing and

41
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.529
thinking and understanding and so on. Um, AND, um,

42
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.330
one place to start as it were in the

43
00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.520
philosophy of mind in, in, uh, in other words,

44
00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.500
in trying to understand what the mind is, is

45
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.690
to sort of begin from that, um, fluid use

46
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.270
of those concepts within everyday life and to try

47
00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.740
to give an interpretation of it. And, and that's

48
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.889
where I suppose a lot of the shouting begins

49
00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.850
as to how you, how you make sense of

50
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.490
it and what it tells you about the mind.

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.779
So a very common idea and this, I guess

52
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.619
applies not only to common people, but also to

53
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.259
intellectuals in general is that we tend to think

54
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.919
about the mind as an inner world. Why is

55
00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.509
that important here? And what do you think about

56
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.529
that idea?

57
00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.800
I, I think it is a very common idea.

58
00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.779
Um A, as you say, both within philosophy but

59
00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:17.309
also other, other disciplines, um closely associated disciplines like

60
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.460
parts of cognitive science, but, but also in, in,

61
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.470
in all sorts of areas of, of, of academia

62
00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.550
and everyday life. Um And in, in the book,

63
00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.350
I call it Cartesian is, although I, I realize

64
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.389
that that's not necessarily historically accurate, I'm sure lots

65
00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.259
of Descartes scholars would take me up on that.

66
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.399
But, but um it's kind of just a measure

67
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.759
of how influential Descartes is that you can, you

68
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.720
can use his name in all sorts of sorts

69
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.830
of ways. Um But, but I think that idea

70
00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.014
of the mind is, is an, the world is

71
00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:51.544
um uh very important, very common. Um And we

72
00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.985
often talk about it in everyday life without really

73
00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:57.725
noticing, you know, well, in my head, I'm thinking

74
00:03:57.735 --> 00:03:59.895
that such and such or, you know, just deep

75
00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:02.335
down inside, I think that idea is not gonna

76
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.104
work or what have you. So, so it is

77
00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:10.600
important um within philosophy, I suppose there have been

78
00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:13.880
roughly speaking, two attitudes you could take towards it

79
00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.059
to take towards that, that idea of mind as

80
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.839
an inner world, you could try as it were

81
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.410
to take it seriously. In other words, you could

82
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.239
try to give an account of what that inner

83
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.040
world is. Um And we can talk about different

84
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:29.450
versions of that approach, different versions of what I'm

85
00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:34.140
calling Cartesian is. Um OF course, uh in the

86
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.149
past, many more philosophers might have been willing to

87
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.769
say that that inner world is something non material.

88
00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.320
It's, they might have talked about it as a

89
00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:44.600
soul or spirit. Um IN that sense, it's not

90
00:04:44.609 --> 00:04:47.329
strictly speaking inner. Although of course, then we get

91
00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.929
to lots of the problems with, with that view

92
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.809
um of, of trying to, to say how it,

93
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.399
how it um interacts with the body. Um OR

94
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.769
the much more common approach nowadays, of course, is

95
00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.359
some variety of materialism when you uh might say,

96
00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.200
well, that world is literally in a, in that

97
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.209
it's located somewhere in physical space and, and the

98
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.869
brain is typically where um where it's located. So,

99
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.839
um so, so Cartesian is in that broad sense

100
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.019
of, of that mind as in a world can

101
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:22.459
come in in dualist and, and materialist versions. Um

102
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.390
So that's as it were one strand and saying,

103
00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.260
well, we have this talk about mind as in

104
00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:29.200
a world. Um Let's try to, to sort of

105
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.179
make sense of that, to, to, to understand what

106
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.269
the mind is, what that inner world is. Is

107
00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.200
it something physical? Is it something non-physical? Then there's

108
00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:43.119
another strand probably less dominant, especially nowadays, um and

109
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.519
behaviorism would be the kind of key example here

110
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.619
which says, look, this talk about the inner world

111
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.720
is suspect in some way or other. Um So

112
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.480
we should try to do without it. Um And

113
00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:56.079
we should try, let's say to um in the

114
00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.359
classic version of behaviorism to, to um translate the

115
00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.480
talk about the inner world, to talk about patterns

116
00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:06.809
of behavior, something like that. And I guess one

117
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.410
way of trying to put the, the you mentioned

118
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.290
this term mental fiction is which is a kind

119
00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:12.230
of label you can use for the view. I'm

120
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:15.029
I'm trying to push um would be to s

121
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.769
be in a way something that sits between those

122
00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.250
two positions. So that says on the one hand,

123
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.429
Cartesian is, is right to say that this notion

124
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.510
of the inner world is uh important and we

125
00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.809
can't do away with it like the behaviorist to

126
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.079
do. But on the other hand, um uh we

127
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.709
shouldn't follow Cartesian is in taking that in a

128
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.880
world seriously. In other words, we shouldn't think that

129
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.739
it exists. So, so the overall position is to

130
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.910
say we have this notion of part of everyday

131
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.329
life and philosophy of mind as an inner world.

132
00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:49.720
And that's a useful fiction. In other words, it's

133
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.109
part and parcel of our language in a sense.

134
00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.369
We can't, at least in our culture, we can't

135
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.869
avoid thinking about people in those ways. Um But

136
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.369
strictly speaking, there is no such inner world, it's

137
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.260
a useful fiction for making sense, ultimately, of, of

138
00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.829
behavior.

139
00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:09.119
So we'll come back to mental future because I

140
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.980
want to explore some uh a little bit more

141
00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:15.010
about it and also some of its implications, of

142
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.359
course, but you mentioned several different philosophical approaches to

143
00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:22.029
the mind there and I would like to break

144
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.209
them down a little bit further. So one that

145
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.410
is very prevalent nowadays as well is thinking about

146
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.970
the mind as a machine. And uh it's interesting

147
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.399
that uh you're talking about metaphors in the book

148
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.079
and uh a very relevant metaphor nowadays that I

149
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:45.579
guess uh it is like that because we tend

150
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:49.040
to derive metaphors from the kind of many times

151
00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:51.420
from the kinds of technologies that we use in

152
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:56.119
the mind as a computer. So what do you

153
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.920
make of it? What are perhaps some of its

154
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.480
uh limitations if you think that it has any?

155
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.420
Mm Yes, I th I think, I mean, I

156
00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:07.850
think you're right to, to point to the importance

157
00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:11.179
of um a, a sort of um a mechanistic

158
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.989
type thinking in one way to put the inner

159
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.230
world idea is it's usually cashed out today would

160
00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:20.809
be a sort of inner mechanism. Um And um

161
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.260
you know, the history here is complicated but, but

162
00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.559
certainly beginning, at least with the British empiricist, you

163
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.079
seem to see this idea that um you know,

164
00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:34.349
in, in the, the, the famous um uh uh

165
00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:37.049
association of hume of being the sort of Newton

166
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.030
of the inner world rather than the outer, this

167
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.510
thought that ideas are somehow uh items that have

168
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.729
um what, what Ryall would call para mechanical. So

169
00:08:46.739 --> 00:08:49.809
in other words, not quite mechanical, but um something,

170
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.409
something rather close, even if a bit spookier um

171
00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:54.419
that, that we should try to discover that, that

172
00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.450
associate between ideas and uh between our ideas for,

173
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.969
for instance. Um So, uh and now I, I

174
00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:07.489
suppose that that um you know, Cartesian is in,

175
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.250
in, in the sort of materialist form that I

176
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.729
mentioned. You, you, you, you mentioned the computational view

177
00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:14.630
is one way to see that is in an

178
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.369
attempt to make, to make um that idea something

179
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.080
we, we take literally not metaphorically, right to say

180
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.070
that in some sense, the mind literally is a

181
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.500
computer. Um uh FOR instance, um and, and to

182
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.409
sort of, of course, computation is one very powerful

183
00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.590
means that people have tried to use to sort

184
00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:38.349
of cash out that in internal mechanism view of

185
00:09:38.359 --> 00:09:39.809
mine and see how it, how it could be

186
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.640
made to work, you know, how, how could it

187
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.460
be that we could have these states that um

188
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.010
uh that represent the world that cause other states

189
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.070
to arise, cause behavior and, and so on. And

190
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.320
that's, that's been enormously powerful. Um I suppose my,

191
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.429
my own view there would, would go back to

192
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.479
what I said earlier that this, that this way

193
00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:03.770
of talking, it seems to me um of a

194
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.130
mind as in a mechanisms on is um n

195
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.049
not only there in uh in philosophy and in

196
00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.400
particularly sophisticated versions like the computational theory of mind

197
00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:17.000
um but also part of, of everyday life, I

198
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.809
think, I think Carss uh uh uh Cartesian's are

199
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.940
right to say that. Um I don't know how

200
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.330
long it's been part of our everyday sort of

201
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.450
mind. I mean, you know, mechanism, of course, is

202
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.450
something that people often associate with. Um THE, you

203
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.625
know, the scientific revolution as they would put it

204
00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:36.775
from the, the early modern period onwards. But I

205
00:10:36.784 --> 00:10:39.294
do think it's, it's that kind of thinking about

206
00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.234
the inner world is part and parcel of our,

207
00:10:41.244 --> 00:10:44.145
of our everyday concept by now, at least. Um

208
00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:46.424
But I want to say that it, it is

209
00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:50.590
metaphorical. Um IN other words, uh one way to

210
00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:54.359
see that I think is to um to try

211
00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:58.210
to push uh um folk view of that inner

212
00:10:58.219 --> 00:11:02.450
world um to uh as far as you can

213
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.080
to try to um to push it towards being

214
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.179
uh taken literally. And then I think you see

215
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.369
that our ordinary um folk psychology starts to back

216
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.650
off a little bit. And that's one indication that

217
00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:16.090
what we're doing is using a very powerful set

218
00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:18.760
of metaphors, inner machinery of inner states and so

219
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.840
on. Um TO make sense of people without being

220
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.799
committed to thinking that um uh the mine really

221
00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:26.760
isn't in a machine.

222
00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:31.700
Mhm. And what about the position of illuminati is?

223
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.289
Uh, I would like to understand what it is

224
00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:38.809
exactly. And I, if it relates at all to

225
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.330
mental fictional is because II, I mean, uh, uh,

226
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.080
because it's one thing to think about the mind

227
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.599
as a fiction and I guess another thing to

228
00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:52.690
just, uh, try to get rid of the mind

229
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.900
entirely or reducing it to just whatever happens in

230
00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:58.989
the brain. And then if you want to add

231
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.979
something on top of that, I mean, if you

232
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:06.770
can't find it directly in the brain, then it's

233
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.900
just not there, I guess.

234
00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:13.020
Yes. Yes, I think IIII, I think you're right.

235
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.419
I mean, so I, I suppose as I've tried

236
00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:19.030
to, this might sound surprising. It's pa partly as

237
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.950
a result of the way I'm using this, this

238
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.809
um uh terminology to divide up the terrain here.

239
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.460
But, but I suppose one way to put it

240
00:12:25.469 --> 00:12:27.690
would be that I see, I limit is in

241
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.760
a way as um a variety of Cartesian is.

242
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.739
In other words, what Ali is, seems to do

243
00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:38.340
is to broadly speaking, accept the idea that our

244
00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:41.859
ordinary concept of mind is an attempt to describe

245
00:12:41.869 --> 00:12:43.950
it in a world. So that when we attribute

246
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.250
beliefs and desires and hopes and fears and so

247
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.919
on to people, we're attempting to pick out a

248
00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:52.789
state of their inner machinery. Um It's just that

249
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:56.770
the illuminators is pretty pessimistic about that theory and

250
00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.169
thinks that, um, well, like, as they, as they

251
00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.109
will say, lots of folk theories, um it may

252
00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:05.510
well turn out not to be particularly good. And

253
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.419
as a result, if you think that say beliefs

254
00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:11.559
and desires are, are posits, they're, they're, they're, they're

255
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.679
something akin to atoms that folk are conjuring up

256
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.690
in order to explain the observable um behavior in

257
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.030
this case, then they're hostages to fortune. Then it

258
00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:25.219
it could turn out that our final cognitive science

259
00:13:25.229 --> 00:13:28.429
will not find a place for beliefs, desires, hopes,

260
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.320
fears, and, and so on. So so that I

261
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.570
suppose the way I would see it is that

262
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.669
um I in a sense, both something like the

263
00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:38.409
computational theory of mind and the limit of it

264
00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:41.109
have this kind of common starting point of thinking

265
00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:44.070
that what the folk are doing, what our ordinary

266
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.429
concept of mind is doing is attempting to describe

267
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.940
an inner machinery, the computation list, at least in

268
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.390
some forms. And, and Jerry Fodor and the, and

269
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.619
the classical computation theory would be the, the best

270
00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:00.140
example here is an attempt to show how that

271
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.650
folk view can be made as it were scientifically

272
00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.119
respectable, how we we could turn out to have

273
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.539
these inner states. Whereas others like the Churchland and

274
00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:11.090
Paul and Patricia, Churchland would be examples of people

275
00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:14.169
who seem to accept the same starting point. That's

276
00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:15.900
what it would really be for us to have

277
00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:18.609
beliefs and desires but to be much more pessimistic

278
00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:20.409
and place a different bet on the future of

279
00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:22.989
cognitive science. And I guess what I'm saying is,

280
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.460
I think the fictional list rejects that common starting

281
00:14:25.469 --> 00:14:28.599
point. They reject the idea that what the folk

282
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:30.409
are doing, what the concept of mind is doing

283
00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:32.409
is trying to pick out an inner world. Um

284
00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:34.530
So that, that would be how I would understand

285
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.200
the difference. It could be that um There are,

286
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.570
there are other ways in which, um uh there's

287
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.150
a li a little different to the way some,

288
00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:43.340
some people who are fictional lists in different domains

289
00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:45.940
might, might see the relationship between fictional and lit.

290
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.559
But uh yeah,

291
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.250
so another approach that you also mentioned earlier that

292
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.940
today is not very popular is behaviorism. So what

293
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.669
do you think that are perhaps some of the

294
00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:04.950
biggest difficulties that it faces when approaching the mind?

295
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.989
And does it relate to a fictional is in

296
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.090
any way at all or?

297
00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:15.500
I think so? I think so. I mean, um

298
00:15:15.869 --> 00:15:18.880
uh iii I know that, so that the term

299
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.239
be, you know, the, the name, behaviorism, of course,

300
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.059
um, a term you're quite right in, in some

301
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.010
areas doesn't, um, uh have AAA great reputation nowadays.

302
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.280
So perhaps I, I should distance myself from it

303
00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:33.049
as far as possible. And I do think there

304
00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:36.179
are differences between fiction and behaviorism. Although I, I

305
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.440
think behaviorism's given a bit more of a bad

306
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.130
reputation than it than it really deserves. Actually, there's

307
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.789
a, there's a, some forms are, are, are, are

308
00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:46.320
um uh I, I think um are really onto

309
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:51.159
something. Um BUT um perhaps 11 way to put

310
00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:54.419
the point in general um would be to say

311
00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:56.900
that it seems to me and this, this goes

312
00:15:56.909 --> 00:15:59.020
back to what I said earlier. If, if Cartesian

313
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.359
is, is on one side as, as taking the

314
00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:06.070
inner world seriously and thinking that in a sense

315
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.260
for the mind to exist, the inner world has

316
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:14.719
to exist. And then behaviorism and associated ideas seem

317
00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:17.570
roughly speaking to be trying to do away with

318
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.390
that notion of the inner world. And I said

319
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.210
that in a sense where fictional is sits as

320
00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:25.059
I see, it is kind of between those two

321
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.979
views. It says, well, we need to retain this

322
00:16:26.989 --> 00:16:28.590
idea of the inner world. But as a useful

323
00:16:28.599 --> 00:16:33.820
fiction, I think that can help to explain um

324
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.979
the difficulties or the the problems that behaviorism got

325
00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:40.840
into and how fiction is can avoid them. So

326
00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:43.830
let, let me give you one example. Um uh

327
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.419
THE, the kind of classic way of understanding behavior

328
00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:49.630
is at least in philosophy is to say that

329
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.599
what it's really trying to do is um to

330
00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:55.880
do without talk about inner states. In other words,

331
00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:59.650
to show how um a a claim about say

332
00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:03.849
someone's beliefs or desires uh can be translated to

333
00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:06.079
a claim about their behavior about what they would

334
00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.920
do under certain circumstances. So it's an attempt to

335
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.069
sort of to do away with that m mental

336
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.858
as it's sometimes called or talk about um about

337
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.469
the inner world and translate it into to talk

338
00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:19.949
about behavior. And, and that, that project is often

339
00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:25.000
said to be to be doomed. Um It, from

340
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.880
the perspective of fiction is I think the failure

341
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.880
of that project of, of translating, talk about the

342
00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.560
mind to talk about behavior turns out to be

343
00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:38.089
a, a very um general feature of our, of

344
00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:41.319
our language, which is um that, that we often

345
00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:44.979
need metaphors. In other words, we often can't translate

346
00:17:44.989 --> 00:17:50.380
metaphors into um uh straightforward literal paraphrases. So I,

347
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.540
I think that this notion of mind is an

348
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.500
inner world is like a lot of metaphors, is

349
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.160
adding richness to our language is allowing us to

350
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.449
say things about people that we can't say otherwise.

351
00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:06.250
Um And that's why at least that classic form

352
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.890
of behaviorism which tries to do without talk about

353
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.119
the inner world fails. That's why we, we can't

354
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.089
do without that um feature of a, a language.

355
00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:15.979
And I think you can say the same about

356
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.630
some other um uh theories of mind um that

357
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.550
are, are sort of akin to behaviorism. Like instrumental

358
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.800
is for instance, that, that the sort of key

359
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.469
mistake that they make is if, if the Cartesian

360
00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:35.369
takes the inner world too seriously, views like behaviorism,

361
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.569
I think don't take it seriously enough in the

362
00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:40.250
sense that they don't see that it's doing something

363
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.280
for us. And one of the things that it's

364
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.550
doing is adding richness of expression that it's adding

365
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.849
to our powers of expression. So that, that would

366
00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:50.040
be one way in which I would try at

367
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.030
least to make the case that some of the,

368
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.579
the, the well known um uh problems with behaviorism

369
00:18:56.589 --> 00:18:59.550
are not, um uh uh are not fatal to

370
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.739
the fiction list. Yeah.

371
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.310
Uh By the way, for the audience specifically, you

372
00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:07.430
mentioned instrumental is there, could you tell us a

373
00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.339
little bit more about what is, what it is

374
00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:10.979
basically?

375
00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:15.689
Yes, I, I try the, the um I suppose

376
00:19:15.699 --> 00:19:20.060
that the, the instru an instrumentalist position would be

377
00:19:20.069 --> 00:19:23.989
similar to behaviorism and what, what behaviorism. So the

378
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.359
views here are complicated and I'm simplifying a little

379
00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:29.089
bit but, but the, the classic form of behaviorism

380
00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:32.329
might be to say something like, look, uh when

381
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.719
I say some, for instance, someone uh wants an

382
00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:37.300
ice cream. So I say, you know, or I

383
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.150
say they, they, they desire ice cream. I'm um

384
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.650
I'm not trying to pick out some uh um

385
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.229
state in their uh in their head or in

386
00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:48.089
their inner machinery or what have you that has

387
00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:50.290
that content that's gonna cause them to do something.

388
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.560
I'm really just saying something like if you give

389
00:19:52.569 --> 00:19:55.010
them a chance, they'll buy an ice cream, something

390
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.430
like that, right? So, in other words, if under

391
00:19:57.439 --> 00:19:59.449
these situations, you know, standing in front of an

392
00:19:59.459 --> 00:20:01.739
ice cream shop, they will do something, go and

393
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.859
buy an ice cream. And of course, you know,

394
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.760
one of the very well known problems for, for

395
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.000
behavior is in that very simplistic form is that,

396
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.709
um uh roughly speaking, what we do under certain

397
00:20:14.719 --> 00:20:17.780
circumstances seems to depend not just on one mental

398
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.819
state, we might have like the desire for ice

399
00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:21.790
cream, but all sorts of other mental states. So,

400
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.260
you know, if we think that this shop is

401
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.989
charging too much for its ice cream, however much

402
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.755
we want one. THAT belief, this is extortionate um

403
00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:32.795
will result in a different behavior which is walking

404
00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:34.555
down the road instead and trying to find another

405
00:20:34.564 --> 00:20:36.875
shop or something like that. Or if we've already,

406
00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:38.685
if we know perfectly well, we've had two ice

407
00:20:38.694 --> 00:20:42.255
creams already today. Despite our love for ice cream,

408
00:20:42.265 --> 00:20:44.400
we might not buy one and so on. So,

409
00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:49.839
so one reason it seems that we can't translate

410
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.439
at least attributions as philosophers put it of individual

411
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:55.949
mental states to behavior seems to be that um

412
00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:58.439
a kind of holism that, that what we do

413
00:20:58.449 --> 00:21:00.765
seems to, it would depend on not just any

414
00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:02.594
a particular mental state that we have like a

415
00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:04.625
desire for ice cream, but all sorts of others

416
00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:07.444
like the desire not to spend too much money

417
00:21:07.454 --> 00:21:10.625
or the, the belief that, you know, £3.50 is

418
00:21:10.635 --> 00:21:13.025
extortionate for a for an ice Lolly or whatever

419
00:21:13.035 --> 00:21:16.224
it is. Right. So, um and I suppose that

420
00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:19.324
sort of connectedness that holism of mental states is

421
00:21:19.334 --> 00:21:22.885
what the instrumentalist tries to say, take seriously to

422
00:21:22.895 --> 00:21:26.719
say, um Roughly speaking, that what we're doing when

423
00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:29.300
we attribute a mental state is we're, we're very

424
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.400
often attributing m far more than one. And we're

425
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.880
giving a sort of um uh convenient description that

426
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.680
allows us to um uh to pick out a

427
00:21:41.689 --> 00:21:44.650
pattern of behavior. Um So, what we're doing is

428
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.459
roughly speaking, well, saying, well, you can make sense

429
00:21:47.469 --> 00:21:51.410
of someone's behavior if you um uh you know,

430
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.270
the, the were to plug in this belief and

431
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.579
this desire and that will explain, that will explain

432
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:59.030
is perhaps a bit more of a contentious way

433
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.109
of putting it, describe at least what they will,

434
00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:04.069
what they will do. Um So, so in a

435
00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:08.319
sense that the instrumentalist is um a a allows

436
00:22:08.329 --> 00:22:12.140
for that um uh thought that what we do

437
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.040
depends on more than one mental state that we

438
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.719
have. Nevertheless, like the behaviorist, the instrumentalists will typically

439
00:22:18.729 --> 00:22:21.189
want to do without the idea of inner states.

440
00:22:21.199 --> 00:22:22.829
They'll just say this is just a kind of

441
00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:27.560
convenient machinery um for predicting behavior. And it's just

442
00:22:27.569 --> 00:22:29.510
that we have to plug in more than one

443
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.930
mental state into that machinery to chug out a

444
00:22:31.939 --> 00:22:34.560
particular answer. But still, we're not talking about an

445
00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:37.349
inner world. That's, that's roughly as one way of

446
00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:40.739
putting the, the idea of um uh of instrumental.

447
00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:45.000
Um And again, the key way that fiction is,

448
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.430
differs from that is saying, no, no, no, there

449
00:22:47.439 --> 00:22:51.280
is um there is a, a reference to an

450
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.589
inner, an inner world. There is um and, and

451
00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:57.489
there are classic thought experiments that are often brought

452
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.979
up to try to show that instrumental is, is

453
00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:04.829
um is mistaken. Um And we could talk about

454
00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:06.180
some of those if you like. But the, the

455
00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:08.699
blockhead is one famous example where you're supposed to

456
00:23:08.709 --> 00:23:13.300
imagine a robot, which whose sort of external behavior

457
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.219
is seemingly indistinguishable from a regular um flesh and

458
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.349
blood person, but who just has this sort of

459
00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:22.219
giant look up table inside of what's an appropriate

460
00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:24.020
thing to do. You know, if ice cream costs

461
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.280
more than £3.50 then say no, thank you and

462
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.640
move on or what have you. And the intuition

463
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.270
that, that th thought experiments like that are, are

464
00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:35.369
often said to elicit is the thought that you

465
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.900
would say, OK, if that's how things are going

466
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.770
on inside, then this, this being wouldn't have a

467
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.459
mind. So in other words, they're, they're often said

468
00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:46.819
to show that we care about more than external

469
00:23:46.829 --> 00:23:49.180
behavior. And again, I want to say, well, that's

470
00:23:49.189 --> 00:23:52.150
because this notion of it in a world is

471
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.160
part and parcel of our concept of mind. Um

472
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.920
But it, but it's one as I said that

473
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.060
I think we, we use as a useful fiction

474
00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:00.650
that we, that we treat metaphorical.

475
00:24:00.819 --> 00:24:05.089
Yeah. So let's just do one more approach before

476
00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:08.199
we go back to mental fictional is. And I

477
00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:11.599
guess that it's important for us to cover this

478
00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:14.510
one because the, the author behind it is a

479
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.229
very prominent philosopher. So, what do you make of

480
00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:21.180
Daniel Dennett s approach to the mind?

481
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.410
Hm. Um I think, yes, I, I think it,

482
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.170
it is a very important, um, approach and, um,

483
00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:31.349
uh, and it's possibly as, as I see it

484
00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:34.040
anyway, Dennett may well, well, we disagree. I know.

485
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.959
Um, uh, SO, um, Dan Dennett very kindly, uh,

486
00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:41.030
contributed a, um, a, a paper to avoid your

487
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.180
moment. Fiction is that I edited last year and

488
00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:44.729
I think the title is, am I a fictional

489
00:24:44.739 --> 00:24:46.839
list? And, and the, the first sentence is something

490
00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:49.060
like, well, sort of, yes and no. Um, AND

491
00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:52.550
I think, you know, he's quite rightly often resisted

492
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.290
quick labels for the position that, that he has

493
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.119
and that includes instrumental. It also includes fictional. So,

494
00:24:59.469 --> 00:25:01.949
um, so, you know, um, sometimes these labels aren't,

495
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:04.089
aren't helpful and, and then its views, a very

496
00:25:04.099 --> 00:25:07.750
sophisticated one, I think what I would say is,

497
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.910
it seems to me that there are important similarities

498
00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.069
between, um, the kind of fiction view that I

499
00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:17.849
want to put forward and Dennes position and that

500
00:25:17.859 --> 00:25:20.949
perhaps the kind of machinery that I want to,

501
00:25:21.199 --> 00:25:24.569
um, to use to, um, uh, to cash out

502
00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:27.630
this fiction, this view can explain some of the

503
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.660
can try to again avoid some of the problems

504
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.079
that, that, that den it's view is sometimes said

505
00:25:33.089 --> 00:25:34.949
to, to have. So perhaps I'll give you one

506
00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:39.709
example of that. So, so um uh the, the,

507
00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:41.989
the view that I would want to put forward

508
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.849
to say, well, what does it mean really to

509
00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:46.410
say that we treat the mind as a, a

510
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.609
useful fiction, We treat the inner world as useful

511
00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:52.949
fiction. Well, it's something like um uh the, the,

512
00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:56.550
the Cartesian says, um well, well, we attribute a

513
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.920
belief, for instance, we're roughly speaking, saying someone's got

514
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.060
an inner state with a certain content that causes

515
00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:06.890
them to behave in a certain way. And the

516
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.640
way I would see it is that what we're

517
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.349
doing is uh um roughly speaking, pretending that someone's

518
00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:15.989
got a certain inner state, right? Um We're using

519
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.859
that as a useful metaphor. We're saying it's as

520
00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:21.329
if they were guided by this inner state. Um

521
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.510
uh But we don't take that too seriously. We

522
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.489
treat it as a metaphor and I think that

523
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.719
perhaps this is something we'll come onto later. Um

524
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.640
I think that the source for that metaphor, that

525
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.180
the, the as it were the domain that gives

526
00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:36.989
us those, the richness of those ideas of inner

527
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.020
states is um roughly speaking, um external representations, especially

528
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.400
language. So roughly, we talk as if people had

529
00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.479
something like language inside their heads that captures their

530
00:26:48.489 --> 00:26:50.699
beliefs and desires and causes them to behave in

531
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:54.959
certain ways. Um um Even though they don't. Um

532
00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:57.089
So, so if I go back to, to, to

533
00:26:57.099 --> 00:27:00.109
den, it's view, um uh I, I, in his

534
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:03.359
terms, taking the, what he calls the intentional stance

535
00:27:03.369 --> 00:27:06.229
to somebody, of course, is often glossed in a

536
00:27:06.239 --> 00:27:08.390
similar way. It's to say we treat people as

537
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.699
if they had beliefs and desires for instance, and

538
00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:16.219
we don't care too much perhaps about their inner

539
00:27:16.229 --> 00:27:18.939
machinery when we, when we do that. Um So

540
00:27:18.949 --> 00:27:21.430
the, so there does, I think even though as

541
00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.520
I said, I, I'm not sure that Dennett would

542
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.619
light the label of, of fiction is there does

543
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:29.810
seem to be something similar there. And another similarity

544
00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:33.250
is that I think that um then it would

545
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.119
um and say that there are, as he puts

546
00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.660
it real patterns in our behavior that are picked

547
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.550
out by talking in that way. And I think

548
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.310
the fiction is, can say the same thing. There

549
00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:44.430
are real patterns in our behavior that are picked

550
00:27:44.439 --> 00:27:47.020
out by these metaphors by this, by this fiction.

551
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:51.640
Um Perhaps just to indicate one way in which

552
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.150
I think this machinery of, of fictional can, can

553
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.989
help to avoid some, some problems that, that Dennett

554
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.819
view is often said to have one problem is

555
00:28:00.829 --> 00:28:05.030
people are worried well, if all of our talk

556
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.555
um about functionality as it's put about thoughts and

557
00:28:08.564 --> 00:28:11.385
so on, has this is, it involves taking the

558
00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:14.244
intentional stance. Has this kind of a, as if

559
00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:19.635
structure, well, then there's no literal case to make

560
00:28:19.645 --> 00:28:21.734
sense of that. So if I, it looks as

561
00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:24.344
if, you know, if I uh want to pretend

562
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:26.535
to be a bear, I have to at least

563
00:28:26.545 --> 00:28:29.729
know what a real bear is, right? Um Or,

564
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:31.630
you know, uh if I pretend to be a

565
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.439
pirate, I have to at least have some idea

566
00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:35.650
about what a, what a a pirate really uh

567
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.339
is and so on. And people have said well,

568
00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:41.599
but I, I if we um think along with

569
00:28:41.609 --> 00:28:44.959
Dennett that taking the intentional stance is always talking

570
00:28:44.969 --> 00:28:47.920
as if people have beliefs and desires say, well,

571
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.560
what is it really to have a belief and

572
00:28:49.569 --> 00:28:53.329
desire? Now again, I want to say, well, whether

573
00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:55.939
or not that's a fair worry for, for Denne,

574
00:28:55.949 --> 00:28:58.189
it's view, I think the fictional list view can

575
00:28:58.199 --> 00:29:00.689
meet it. And that's because as I said earlier,

576
00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:04.589
what really cashes out this pretense I think is

577
00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:08.739
something else, something external particularly written and spoken language.

578
00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:12.040
So we know what it is to say things

579
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.430
um that have meaning for instance. And then we

580
00:29:15.439 --> 00:29:17.810
talk as if people had something a bit like

581
00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:21.250
that in their heads. So it's the, it, it,

582
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.650
in my view, and I think this is a

583
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.199
key difference with Dennett, I would say in a

584
00:29:25.209 --> 00:29:29.150
sense it's language, it's external representations that come first

585
00:29:29.439 --> 00:29:32.199
and that provide the stock of metaphors that we

586
00:29:32.209 --> 00:29:36.260
then project inside to, to create the, as if

587
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.619
intentionality of the mental. And I, and as I

588
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.750
read to him anyway, I think that's probably quite

589
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.010
a big difference from Dennes view and, and he,

590
00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:45.180
um, I don't think would want to accept that

591
00:29:45.189 --> 00:29:48.410
view of intentionality. Um, AS I've said though, it

592
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.660
seems to me that it gets, um, at the

593
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.160
fiction is a response to some really important objections

594
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.640
that are raised against um views like, like Dennis,

595
00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.660
the intentional stance.

596
00:30:00.069 --> 00:30:02.760
Mhm So we'll come back to some of the

597
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.699
things you mentioned there, particularly, for example, representations later

598
00:30:07.709 --> 00:30:10.609
in our conversation. But I would like to ask

599
00:30:10.619 --> 00:30:15.430
you more of a metaphysical question now. So if

600
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:18.959
you are right about uh and if mental fictional

601
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:24.050
is, is right and our mind is just a

602
00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:29.709
useful fiction, then does it, does it exist? I

603
00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:34.010
mean, how do you approach it uh metaphysically do,

604
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.160
does it really exist?

605
00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:40.630
Uh Yeah. Well, here I'm going to, to echo

606
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.800
the response that I mentioned earlier from Dennett a

607
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.280
sort of yes and no or, or sorter as

608
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.020
he says in, in lots of his writings um

609
00:30:48.219 --> 00:30:49.560
uh to, to give you, give you a, a

610
00:30:49.569 --> 00:30:52.089
parallel that I, that I mentioned in the book

611
00:30:52.099 --> 00:30:53.339
and then, and then try to say what I,

612
00:30:53.349 --> 00:30:56.550
what um how I would answer it. Um uh

613
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.229
So I think 11 example that's sometimes used in

614
00:31:01.239 --> 00:31:03.500
in particularly the work of Kendall Walton on, on

615
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.550
metaphor, which I um uh draw upon in the

616
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.939
book is something like talking about clouds as angry.

617
00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:13.369
Um Now, you know, you can say, well, in

618
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.569
fact, it's a bit of a uh overcast day

619
00:31:15.579 --> 00:31:17.650
today, but they were angry. The clouds here were

620
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.250
angry a couple of days ago when we had

621
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.219
a big storm down in Devon. Now, you know,

622
00:31:22.229 --> 00:31:24.459
if you say to me, are there angry clouds?

623
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.560
It looks like the answer is yes and no.

624
00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:30.650
In other words, do I literally think that clouds

625
00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.459
have emotions? Uh No. Um Certainly not. Um Are

626
00:31:35.469 --> 00:31:39.520
there clouds that are quite properly called uh angry?

627
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.760
Um According to a certain metaphor? Well, yes, there,

628
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.130
yes, there are. And roughly in the same sort

629
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.219
of way, although of course, it's more complicated with

630
00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:50.069
the mind. I want to say, if you just

631
00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:52.890
ask me flat out, uh does the mind exist?

632
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.810
I want to say, well, if you mean an

633
00:31:55.819 --> 00:31:58.829
inner world and in particular, um the book focuses

634
00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:01.349
on thought. So if you mean are there um

635
00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:04.439
inner states with content that cause us to behave

636
00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:06.189
in a certain way, which is very often what

637
00:32:06.199 --> 00:32:09.050
people just mean by mental states in the literature

638
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.910
or what they mean by the mind? Then I

639
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.199
think the answer is no, that there is there

640
00:32:13.209 --> 00:32:18.430
is not that inner world of representations um caused

641
00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:20.790
by the what we see and causing us to

642
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.430
behave in certain ways and so on. But if

643
00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:26.579
you mean, are there real patterns as Denne would

644
00:32:26.589 --> 00:32:28.910
put it in our behavior that is, that are

645
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.390
picked out by that metaphor, um which is very

646
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.780
often what we really care about in everyday life.

647
00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.880
When we're talking about whether people want or think

648
00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.849
or desire something, then I think the answer is

649
00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:43.229
yes. So, um so that would be my, the

650
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:46.069
attempt to make that response seem less evasive. I,

651
00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:48.050
if you mean, is there an inner world of

652
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.109
the kind that I've mentioned? No, if you mean

653
00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:55.430
um uh are there real patterns in our behavior?

654
00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:59.469
Um Such that uh ordinary talk about people's beliefs,

655
00:32:59.479 --> 00:33:03.310
desires and so on, um is often true, sometimes

656
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:06.630
false um can be right or wrong then yes,

657
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.599
I think there is.

658
00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:14.219
So when it comes to mental states or what

659
00:33:14.229 --> 00:33:19.540
we usually refer to as mental states, those wouldn't

660
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.900
be real.

661
00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:26.469
Again, I, I, the very often, the way that's

662
00:33:26.479 --> 00:33:28.589
talked about, if we, if you say, what do

663
00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:32.000
you mean by mental states? Um VERY often people

664
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.989
will say, well, I mean, in a state, in

665
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.349
the case of, of say beliefs, an inner state

666
00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:40.130
with content that can be true or false, something

667
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.699
like an inner representation and causal powers. Um And

668
00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:46.560
if that's what you mean by mental state, then

669
00:33:46.569 --> 00:33:49.859
I think n no, that they don't exist. Um

670
00:33:49.949 --> 00:33:52.109
But again, as I say, I think the probably

671
00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:54.839
the folk, for instance, and certainly some varieties of

672
00:33:54.849 --> 00:33:57.949
behaviorism and so on. If you said, um, are

673
00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:00.449
their thoughts or are their beliefs or their desires?

674
00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:02.069
I think there's quite a proper sense in which

675
00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:05.819
the answer is. Yes. Um, BECAUSE, um, as I've

676
00:34:05.829 --> 00:34:09.760
said, there are, um, patterns in our behavior that

677
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.050
we pick out perfectly sensibly using that, using that

678
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:13.969
talk. Yeah.

679
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.179
And so how do you approach then causality? And

680
00:34:19.188 --> 00:34:23.159
how do you explain behavior through the lens of

681
00:34:23.168 --> 00:34:23.969
fictional?

682
00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.300
That's a really a really good question. And it's,

683
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.029
and it's often, of course, um a, a kind

684
00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:38.158
of key uh disagreement or point of difference between

685
00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:41.358
what I've broadly speaking, been calling Cartesian and, and

686
00:34:41.368 --> 00:34:45.378
behaviorist. So, so um y you know, I in

687
00:34:45.388 --> 00:34:47.768
everyday life, it seems like we often say things

688
00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:50.158
like, well, why did you go and you know,

689
00:34:50.168 --> 00:34:52.217
why did you walk off the beach and go

690
00:34:52.228 --> 00:34:54.329
to the beach hut? Uh Because, you know, why

691
00:34:54.339 --> 00:34:55.967
did Adam do that? Because he wanted an ice

692
00:34:55.978 --> 00:35:01.559
cream? And, you know, roughly speaking, uh one view

693
00:35:01.569 --> 00:35:04.878
that, that um that many Cartesian would have is

694
00:35:04.888 --> 00:35:07.099
say, well, that's a kind of causal explanation. I'm

695
00:35:07.108 --> 00:35:10.279
pointing to a particular item in my inner machinery.

696
00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:12.839
Um The desire for ice cream that perhaps together

697
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:16.458
with others um you know, caused me to get

698
00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:18.658
up and, and, and walk to the beach hut.

699
00:35:19.388 --> 00:35:22.168
Whereas of course, the behaviorists will typically give a

700
00:35:22.178 --> 00:35:24.999
different construal of that and say, well, it's more

701
00:35:25.009 --> 00:35:29.280
like, um, uh explaining why the vase broke because

702
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.280
you, because it was fragile. In other words, you're

703
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.479
saying that there's a particular kind of disposition I

704
00:35:34.489 --> 00:35:36.820
have roughly speaking to, to get an ice cream

705
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.570
whenever I get the chance and here was a

706
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.889
chance. Um, uh, SO that we'll, we'll disagree that

707
00:35:41.899 --> 00:35:44.520
they are, they are causal explanations in the sense

708
00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:49.030
that the Cartesian thinks. Um, NOW again, perhaps not

709
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.520
surprisingly that the, I think the fictional view is

710
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.310
somewhere in between. Um So would say, well, look,

711
00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.899
um when you, um uh when you say that

712
00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:04.715
someone's does something because they had a particular belief

713
00:36:04.725 --> 00:36:07.274
or desire and so on, what you're doing is

714
00:36:07.284 --> 00:36:10.445
picking, you're not trying to pick out a particular

715
00:36:10.455 --> 00:36:13.344
item of their inner machinery that's caused a particular

716
00:36:13.354 --> 00:36:17.094
form of behavior. You are really just making sense

717
00:36:17.104 --> 00:36:19.804
of a pattern in their behavior, saying it's useful

718
00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:22.114
to treat them as if they had this and

719
00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:26.610
this uh inner machinery. Um But the, um again,

720
00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.760
this idea of inner machinery I think is um

721
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.189
you know, to go back to what I said

722
00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:34.800
earlier, at least since the early modern period. Um

723
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.080
One of the ways in which we explain things,

724
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.090
you know, one of the, the, the very common

725
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.290
ways in which we give explanations is by pointing

726
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.949
to a particular kind of mechanism. And that um

727
00:36:45.959 --> 00:36:50.810
by invoking these kind of imagined mechanisms, we're making

728
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.429
sense of behavior would be, that would be the

729
00:36:53.439 --> 00:36:55.300
way that I would, would put it. So we,

730
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.439
we, we do give up this idea that we

731
00:36:57.449 --> 00:37:00.669
are trying to pick out inner causes. That's, that's

732
00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:03.469
true. Nevertheless, there's a sense in which we are

733
00:37:03.479 --> 00:37:06.919
picking out a whole state of somebody. Um uh

734
00:37:06.969 --> 00:37:09.310
um USING that, that fiction.

735
00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:13.229
Well, before we go on, let me just tell

736
00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:16.439
you that the philosophy of mind is one of

737
00:37:16.449 --> 00:37:21.489
those, uh let's call it disciplines that where I,

738
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.270
I mean, it's very easy for my mind to

739
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.010
break while thinking about some of the ideas and

740
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.649
concepts there. It's like when I read about fictional

741
00:37:31.659 --> 00:37:35.060
is I just have that temptation to just uh

742
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.340
go with illuminati is instead

743
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:42.560
it's easier. Why, why is that? Um

744
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.840
uh I, I mean, I mean, I don't know,

745
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.669
it's perhaps easier for me just because I was

746
00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:51.149
trained more as a scientist and a philosopher to

747
00:37:51.159 --> 00:37:55.149
understand the I is. But I don't know.

748
00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:58.260
Yeah. Well, of course, one of the, the things

749
00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.939
a fiction would want to say probably there is

750
00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:04.600
um that, that even though limit might seem an

751
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.500
easier path as soon as you step out of

752
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.989
the philosophy room and try to interact with your

753
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.040
fellow human beings, uh You, you will find that

754
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:17.320
you will uh reach for saying what they think

755
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.520
or want or hope and so on. And, um,

756
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.280
and that, that language is, is pretty much indispensable

757
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.969
and I guess that's, that's one way in which

758
00:38:23.979 --> 00:38:27.149
fix is often, often motivated. Um, YEAH,

759
00:38:27.629 --> 00:38:33.280
that's, that's totally fair, totally fair topics you also

760
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.229
talk about in the book is self knowledge. So,

761
00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:41.679
according to the fictional view, how do we find

762
00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:44.860
out about ourselves? And by the way, does the

763
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.800
concept of self apply here?

764
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.610
Hm. Um, IT'S a good, a good question and,

765
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.840
and, um, let, let me start with the, with

766
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.479
self knowledge and then, and then try to try

767
00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:01.080
to, to broaden out a little bit. Um, I

768
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.820
think so that the topic of, you know, thinking

769
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.399
about self knowledge is, is of course extremely important

770
00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:09.689
for, not only for the fictions but also for

771
00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:14.050
all sorts of, um, what I call non Cartesian

772
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.659
positions like, like behaviorism. Um And, you know, there's

773
00:39:19.669 --> 00:39:22.239
the classic joke that many people will repeat in

774
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.540
their, in their, um, you know, first lectures on

775
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.709
philosophy of mind of two behaviorists meet on the

776
00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:29.939
street and one of them says you're fine, how

777
00:39:29.949 --> 00:39:32.979
am I? Um, THE, the thought being that there's

778
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.780
a, you know, behaviorism and related positions is denying

779
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.570
a really obvious fact about mental life, which is

780
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.939
that we have a particular way of finding out

781
00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:46.409
about our own minds. Um, um, THAT is very

782
00:39:46.419 --> 00:39:48.540
different from the way in which we find out

783
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:51.729
about other people's if indeed we can. So, um,

784
00:39:51.949 --> 00:39:54.129
and, and of course, in the sense of, in

785
00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:57.620
the case of mental fictional is, it's particularly um

786
00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:00.310
a an issue because I seem to be granting

787
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.320
that this idea of an inner world is there

788
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.699
and part and parcel of folk psychology. And yet

789
00:40:04.709 --> 00:40:07.139
I'm telling you not to treat it too seriously.

790
00:40:07.149 --> 00:40:10.120
So, so one way to put the challenge from

791
00:40:10.129 --> 00:40:13.419
introspection or self knowledge for the fiction is, is

792
00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:15.959
to say, well, look, you're telling me that we

793
00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:19.189
don't have mental states in the sense of inner

794
00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:22.739
states with content, but I can just look inside

795
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.020
and see that I have them, right? I um

796
00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:28.989
so how can fictional is be uh um a

797
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.919
viable, a viable view, right? So that, that's 11

798
00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:35.800
way to put it. Um And I guess what

799
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.290
I would want to say here is that, that,

800
00:40:38.489 --> 00:40:40.469
that I, in a sense we have as it

801
00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:42.870
were two stages to this one is the thought

802
00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:46.830
that, well, is there an asymmetry between the way

803
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.929
that we know about our own minds and the

804
00:40:48.939 --> 00:40:52.199
way that we know about other people's and if

805
00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:54.100
there is, which it seems that there is, well,

806
00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.070
what does that show? What does it? And, and

807
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.000
you know, one very common response is to say,

808
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.439
well, it shows that there's a certain special faculty

809
00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:04.909
of introspection that's, that's, that gives us access to

810
00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:07.060
the mind in a, in a fundamentally different way.

811
00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:10.479
And I suppose roughly speaking, there's a long story

812
00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:12.320
to tell here. But roughly speaking, I would want

813
00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:16.199
to say Well, look, there is an asymmetry here.

814
00:41:16.209 --> 00:41:20.229
We, we do typically um know more about our

815
00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:23.179
own mind than we know about other people's. Um

816
00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:25.879
But you can, as it were explain that asymmetry

817
00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:29.120
without needing to appeal to a special faculty of

818
00:41:29.129 --> 00:41:34.899
introspection and without um uh nnnn needing to reject

819
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:37.120
fictional. So let, let me, let me say what

820
00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:40.260
I mean by that. So um so, so the,

821
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.879
the, the key case here, it seems that the

822
00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:45.570
key thing to remember is that mainly I'm talking

823
00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.040
about thoughts. In other words, I'm talking about what

824
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:52.199
philosophers would sometimes call propositional attitudes and, and related,

825
00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:54.979
sort of roughly speaking, cognitive aspects of mind, like

826
00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:59.760
concepts and understanding and so on. And now, of

827
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.689
course, um there are also sensations like a, a

828
00:42:03.699 --> 00:42:05.870
sort of, you know, a pain in my stomach

829
00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:09.600
or a, a feeling hot or, or a more

830
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.080
tricky case, perhaps a fiction is sort of he

831
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.239
um hearing, talking to myself, like inner speech as

832
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.659
it's often described. Um And in the case of

833
00:42:19.669 --> 00:42:24.219
sensations, it does seem like there's AAA marked asymmetry

834
00:42:24.229 --> 00:42:25.860
here. I mean, if I have a kind of

835
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:30.239
minor, you know, pain in my stomach, um Well,

836
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:35.830
um you know, uh I feel that, you know,

837
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.040
I, so in a sense, although it's quite misleading

838
00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.280
to put it in these terms, I'm, I'm um

839
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.570
I know that I'm in pain or perhaps better

840
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.199
to say, I just feel it. I just feel

841
00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:46.770
that I'm in pain. If it's not a very

842
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.870
sharp pain that doesn't have me rolling around on

843
00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:50.689
the floor, you may not know. So there does

844
00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:53.800
seem like there's an asymmetry in um with regard

845
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.239
to sensations between um the awareness or the knowledge

846
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.179
that I have and the way that awareness that

847
00:43:00.189 --> 00:43:02.840
you would, you would have of those. I think

848
00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.469
what I'd want to say though is we shouldn't

849
00:43:04.479 --> 00:43:08.500
move too quickly from that asymmetry in talking about

850
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:14.429
sensations to um uh to um think that that

851
00:43:14.439 --> 00:43:16.689
shows that the mind as a whole is an

852
00:43:16.699 --> 00:43:18.689
inner world or that we have that special access

853
00:43:18.699 --> 00:43:20.570
to the mind as a whole and in particular,

854
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.389
when it comes to, to thoughts. So, so the,

855
00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:25.050
the key point here I think is that when

856
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.092
we come to make sense of our own behavior

857
00:43:30.102 --> 00:43:33.221
and our own sensations, we do need to make

858
00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:36.451
sense of them and in particular, the step from

859
00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:40.211
how we're behaving or what sensations we're having to,

860
00:43:40.221 --> 00:43:45.382
our thoughts is um still an interpretive step where

861
00:43:45.392 --> 00:43:48.052
we draw upon all the resources of, of folks

862
00:43:48.062 --> 00:43:50.843
like. So, you know, um if I had a

863
00:43:50.854 --> 00:43:53.864
little grumbling in my stomach before I had this,

864
00:43:53.874 --> 00:43:57.364
this uh meeting this interview with you, um And

865
00:43:57.374 --> 00:44:00.174
I did, um and you know, I could think

866
00:44:00.184 --> 00:44:04.043
to myself. Oh OK. Uh Am I um apprehensive

867
00:44:04.053 --> 00:44:06.513
about this interview? Am I, am I worried about

868
00:44:06.523 --> 00:44:09.434
how it will, will go? Um You know, do

869
00:44:09.444 --> 00:44:11.174
I hope it will go well and so on.

870
00:44:11.355 --> 00:44:13.095
Um And then I realized, oh, no, no, I

871
00:44:13.105 --> 00:44:14.825
haven't eaten my lunch yet. I've just been so

872
00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:17.085
busy. I've forgotten that I haven't eaten my sandwich

873
00:44:17.095 --> 00:44:19.726
and I, I was just, in other words, you

874
00:44:19.736 --> 00:44:21.565
know, uh and this is something that Gilbert Ryle

875
00:44:21.575 --> 00:44:25.686
emphasized, um, uh really nicely as well that these

876
00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:28.535
sensations that we have don't come hallmarked as Ryle

877
00:44:28.545 --> 00:44:30.615
puts it, they don't come with a particular stamp

878
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.436
saying this is a grumble of hunger or this

879
00:44:32.446 --> 00:44:34.335
is a grumble of nerves or what have you.

880
00:44:34.516 --> 00:44:37.305
And, and so, so that would be my thought

881
00:44:37.315 --> 00:44:39.726
that we, we do, we have only, we have

882
00:44:39.736 --> 00:44:42.610
our sensations. Uh We spend a lot of time

883
00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.969
with ourselves compared to the time that we spend

884
00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:49.340
with other people even uh um uh uh close

885
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.260
um family and friends. We, if you're anything like

886
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.469
me, we say things to ourselves. Um SOMETIMES out

887
00:44:55.479 --> 00:45:00.300
loud. Um YOU know, um sometimes uh um in,

888
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.010
in, in a speech, in a, a kind of

889
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.159
quasi sensational way, but still the key point is

890
00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:10.179
strictly speaking, even when we're having those sensations of

891
00:45:10.189 --> 00:45:13.070
inner speech, we're not listening to our thoughts. Um

892
00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:15.429
We uh we have to take a step of

893
00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:19.389
interpreting those sensations to get to the question of

894
00:45:19.399 --> 00:45:21.290
what do we think? What have we decided to

895
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.060
do? What do we judge? And that's where fictional

896
00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:25.500
comes in, I think. Yeah.

897
00:45:26.149 --> 00:45:28.409
And so let's talk a little bit more about

898
00:45:28.419 --> 00:45:32.520
mental representations. That's something that you mentioned earlier and

899
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:37.669
you mentioned specifically external representations if I remember correctly.

900
00:45:37.679 --> 00:45:42.300
So what do philosophers of mind really mean when

901
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.929
they mention or talk about representations? What is a

902
00:45:46.939 --> 00:45:52.600
mental representation specifically? And what kinds of representations would

903
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.560
apply in the case of fictional?

904
00:45:56.979 --> 00:45:58.770
That's a good uh uh Yeah, a good, a

905
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.889
good question. Um uh There's a sense in which

906
00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:04.370
I'm not the right person to answer the question

907
00:46:04.379 --> 00:46:07.560
of, of what mental representations are cos I, I

908
00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.939
don't think we have any. Um So that's one

909
00:46:09.949 --> 00:46:15.090
of the, the sort of um uh uh perhaps

910
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.959
radical or counterintuitive um uh a aspects of, of

911
00:46:19.969 --> 00:46:23.020
mental fiction is. Um So, but I'll, but I'll

912
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.669
try to, I'll, I'll try to give AAA an,

913
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.800
an overview of how the idea is normally understood

914
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.489
and then tell you what, what I would, what

915
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.459
I would like to say. Um So, so I

916
00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:35.409
guess, you know, the, the, the problem here is

917
00:46:35.419 --> 00:46:38.550
what, what is usually called the problem of intentionality

918
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.500
or the, the problem of um explaining um about

919
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:46.320
n or content. And, and of course, when you,

920
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.090
when you raise the question, that way you can

921
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.790
see that on the face of it, at least

922
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.179
there are all sorts of representations in the world.

923
00:46:53.189 --> 00:46:56.500
In other words, there are all sorts of um

924
00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.389
things, states processes, what have you that seem to

925
00:47:00.399 --> 00:47:03.409
be about other things, states processes or to have

926
00:47:03.419 --> 00:47:07.669
content. So um obvious examples are, you know, I'm

927
00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:10.790
I'm saying words, I'm making disturbances in the air

928
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.889
that are being captured on, on um hopefully captured

929
00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:17.550
by this microphone. Um And um you know, uh

930
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.659
then resulting in a, I'm gonna show my limits

931
00:47:20.669 --> 00:47:23.185
and my technical knowledge here resulting in some distribution

932
00:47:23.195 --> 00:47:27.495
of magnetic, you know, uh o on um uh

933
00:47:27.504 --> 00:47:29.495
uh alignments on a hard drive or what have

934
00:47:29.504 --> 00:47:32.754
you, right? So, so the there are on the

935
00:47:32.764 --> 00:47:35.274
face of it, it seems lots of different representations

936
00:47:35.284 --> 00:47:39.715
from spoken and written language to road signs to

937
00:47:39.725 --> 00:47:43.334
um uh um Semaphore and all, all, all sorts

938
00:47:43.344 --> 00:47:48.669
of uh of different things. Um And uh and

939
00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.520
in amongst those are our thoughts or our beliefs

940
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.129
and desires, we would typically say, well, they also

941
00:47:54.139 --> 00:47:56.919
have content, you know, if I have the belief

942
00:47:56.929 --> 00:48:00.469
that um uh Derby is in England. Um Well,

943
00:48:00.479 --> 00:48:03.840
then that's a belief that's about a certain city.

944
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.959
Um AND um uh and England and my belief

945
00:48:06.969 --> 00:48:08.939
could be true or false and, and so on.

946
00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:11.199
So, thoughts seem to be one of these um

947
00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:14.050
things in the world that have content. And roughly

948
00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.510
speaking, I suppose the question is, well, how do

949
00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.040
you explain that? How, how do you explain how

950
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:23.620
these things get their content and the, the view

951
00:48:23.629 --> 00:48:27.050
that would look to mental representations, I suppose. Um

952
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.679
uh Does that offers that explanation by as it

953
00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:33.870
were seeing a certain kind of dependence or hierarchy,

954
00:48:33.879 --> 00:48:38.389
it says, well, ultimately, although um there are, there

955
00:48:38.399 --> 00:48:41.620
are lots of in phenomena with, there are representations

956
00:48:41.629 --> 00:48:44.199
or with content marks on a page disturbances in

957
00:48:44.209 --> 00:48:46.580
the air and so on. Ultimately, they all get

958
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:52.500
their content from thought from uh um people's beliefs

959
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.860
and desires of writers or readers and so on

960
00:48:55.149 --> 00:48:59.010
and people's uh and thoughts get their content from

961
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.810
inner representations, right? So, and as I've said that,

962
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.600
that view, that's roughly speaking, what I've been calling

963
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.239
Cartesian is now applied to, to thoughts and representational

964
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.219
is, is a general term that people would use

965
00:49:12.229 --> 00:49:16.040
there. And you can find it um in Descartes,

966
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.909
you can find it in hume and uh lock

967
00:49:18.919 --> 00:49:21.580
and so on. Um And you can find it

968
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.729
in uh much of cognitive science as well. Um

969
00:49:24.949 --> 00:49:28.459
And of course, they'll talk about those representations in

970
00:49:28.469 --> 00:49:30.629
different ways. Some of them might think they're predominantly

971
00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:33.050
language like other people might see them as more

972
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.270
picture like and so on. Perhaps other sorts of

973
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.310
formats that you find in, in connection is, for

974
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.659
instance. Um um And they, you know, you could

975
00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:44.110
have that view and be a dualist. I think

976
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.689
these things are non-physical more commonly nowadays, you would

977
00:49:46.699 --> 00:49:50.209
think that they are, they're somehow um realized in

978
00:49:50.219 --> 00:49:55.199
the brain for instance. So, um uh so, so

979
00:49:55.209 --> 00:49:57.399
the one way to put it would be that

980
00:49:57.409 --> 00:49:59.899
mental representations in the first instance, are a sort

981
00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:03.449
of um nowadays usually understood as a kind of

982
00:50:03.459 --> 00:50:06.830
theoretical posit that we use to explain behavior. And

983
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.439
that gives an explanation for um the how our

984
00:50:10.449 --> 00:50:12.840
thoughts have content. And from there have l how

985
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.060
language have content and so on. So the view

986
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:20.290
that I want to propose basically goes exactly the

987
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.030
other way around. Uh ROUGHLY speaking, I'm, I'm certainly

988
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.090
not alone in, in having this uh th this,

989
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.159
this view um in some sense, m many people

990
00:50:30.169 --> 00:50:32.139
might see something like this in the later Wittgenstein.

991
00:50:32.149 --> 00:50:34.459
Although of course, there's always big questions of the

992
00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:37.689
right interpretation to have there. Um um But roughly

993
00:50:37.699 --> 00:50:39.639
speaking, I would want to say, well, of all

994
00:50:39.649 --> 00:50:42.129
the intentional phenomena of all the things with language,

995
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:45.330
it's it with content, it's really language that comes

996
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.800
first. So I would want to say it's what

997
00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:53.830
comes first really is um uh uh um language

998
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.189
and external representations that um uh represent ultimately due

999
00:50:59.199 --> 00:51:01.699
to social norms and conventions. It's cos we're social

1000
00:51:01.709 --> 00:51:06.790
creatures who um follow certain norms within those practices

1001
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.989
that we have those norm, government practices, we use

1002
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.120
marks, we write things down on bits of paper

1003
00:51:11.129 --> 00:51:14.290
to label things and so on. Um That's ultimately

1004
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.360
where content and intentionality comes into the world. And

1005
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.879
then what happens? I think in the um a

1006
00:51:21.889 --> 00:51:24.290
concept of mind is, as I said earlier, we

1007
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:28.860
then project that um intentionality, that kind of content

1008
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:33.770
that we have through our um uh life as

1009
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.135
normal governed um social creatures um into an imagined

1010
00:51:38.145 --> 00:51:40.155
inner world to make sense of what people are

1011
00:51:40.165 --> 00:51:42.334
doing, even when they're not writing things down, uh

1012
00:51:42.344 --> 00:51:45.145
or saying things and so on. So, so that's

1013
00:51:45.155 --> 00:51:47.175
a long answer because it's a big topic. But

1014
00:51:47.185 --> 00:51:49.024
I guess that's, that would be how I would,

1015
00:51:49.034 --> 00:51:52.514
would understand it. So, so um for the fiction,

1016
00:51:52.524 --> 00:51:56.000
this then the, the, the kind of um the

1017
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.439
sort of lesson at the end there is that

1018
00:51:57.449 --> 00:52:01.780
mental representations don't exist, these inner, inner sentences, inner

1019
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.340
pictures, these inner states with content don't exist, but

1020
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:09.040
they are a metaphorical projection of representations that do

1021
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.719
exist like language and they're very useful for making

1022
00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:13.600
sense of people.

1023
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.790
So I would like to ask you now about

1024
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.350
the extended mind thesis, you talk about it in

1025
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.159
the book and then you also give a fictional

1026
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:28.659
approach to the idea of extended mental states. But

1027
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.000
before we get into your approach, what is the

1028
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:36.540
extended mind? If this is exactly how does it

1029
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.750
approach? Um BASICALLY the relationship between mental states and

1030
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.409
items of material culture. And then what would you

1031
00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:50.810
say uh without uh having a fictional approach to

1032
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.280
it? What are basically its weaknesses?

1033
00:52:54.919 --> 00:52:57.669
OK. Um So I'll start by trying to say

1034
00:52:57.679 --> 00:53:01.830
what the extended mind um thesis in its sort

1035
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.250
of canonical form is and then, and then try

1036
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.750
to, to tell you what I, how I would

1037
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.500
want to reinterpret it. So um I guess the,

1038
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:11.469
the, the canonical form due to, to Andy Clark

1039
00:53:11.479 --> 00:53:14.070
and, and David Chalmers in a, in an extraordinarily

1040
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.810
influential paper from 25 years ago. Now, gosh, uh

1041
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.090
is um is roughly the idea that the skull

1042
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.669
isn't that important when it comes to the mind.

1043
00:53:24.679 --> 00:53:29.560
Um uh And um the classic thought experiment that,

1044
00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.659
that um some of your, your viewers might know

1045
00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:35.610
is this thought experiment of, of Otto and Inger.

1046
00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.060
So in Clark and Chalmers paper, they tell this,

1047
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:43.719
this um story about someone called uh um INGE,

1048
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.239
let's start with INGE and she um uh hears

1049
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:49.620
about the uh an exhibition on, at the museum

1050
00:53:49.629 --> 00:53:52.399
of Bob Knight. Um And she thinks for a

1051
00:53:52.409 --> 00:53:54.669
moment, thinks, oh, the museum is on, I think

1052
00:53:54.679 --> 00:53:58.540
53rd Street. Uh I should know by now how

1053
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.489
many times I've heard this example, but I always

1054
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.989
have to check myself uh 53rd street and she

1055
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.679
sets off, right? And, and now, now here's a

1056
00:54:05.689 --> 00:54:08.250
parallel case that or at least Parker Chalmers want

1057
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.750
to say it's an importantly parallel case of Otto

1058
00:54:10.939 --> 00:54:13.750
and Otto, somebody who suffers from memory loss. And

1059
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.010
so because of that, he carries a notebook with

1060
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.409
him wherever he goes to write down important information.

1061
00:54:18.979 --> 00:54:22.239
So Otto hears about the exhibition, he looks up

1062
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.199
the address of Moma in his notebook, the museum

1063
00:54:25.209 --> 00:54:28.110
in his notebook. Um AND he sets off and

1064
00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.689
roughly speaking, the guiding idea here is that, um,

1065
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:35.679
well, the entries that are written in Otto's notebook

1066
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:40.419
are playing the right causal role, roughly speaking, the

1067
00:54:40.429 --> 00:54:45.169
same causal role as, um, uh, whatever say, um,

1068
00:54:45.179 --> 00:54:49.209
pattern of neurons are encoding or realizing, um, uh,

1069
00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:53.689
inger and biological memory. And so, um, we ought

1070
00:54:53.699 --> 00:54:57.219
to say that the notebook, um, uh, counts as

1071
00:54:57.229 --> 00:54:58.889
hold that the entries in the notebook are Otto

1072
00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:02.409
his beliefs, right? Because, um, they are playing in

1073
00:55:02.419 --> 00:55:06.179
the, um, in the relevant respects the right causal

1074
00:55:06.189 --> 00:55:08.159
role to count his beliefs. So, only a kind

1075
00:55:08.169 --> 00:55:10.520
of skin and skull prejudice is it sometimes, but

1076
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.000
only a sort of, um, uh, a, a prejudice

1077
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.330
that leads us to say, well, surely mind or

1078
00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.780
memory or belief that all can, uh, must be

1079
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:21.919
inside here would lead us to, um, to deny

1080
00:55:21.929 --> 00:55:24.459
that there are lots of complications with that argument.

1081
00:55:24.469 --> 00:55:25.989
There are lots of other ways of putting it.

1082
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.870
So I'm aware that aficionados of the extended mind

1083
00:55:28.879 --> 00:55:31.149
might, might think that's too, too quick. But the,

1084
00:55:31.429 --> 00:55:34.709
the point I would want to make is that

1085
00:55:34.719 --> 00:55:38.229
at least as it's presented in the, the paper

1086
00:55:38.239 --> 00:55:42.229
by Clark and Chalmers in that canonical form, the,

1087
00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:45.850
the, the extended mind thesis, even though it's caused

1088
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.899
an awful lot of debate over the last 25

1089
00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:49.429
years or so. And some people see it as

1090
00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:53.719
a very radical idea. Um, uh, THAT notice that

1091
00:55:53.729 --> 00:55:58.120
it accepts the, the basic view of the mind.

1092
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.669
Um, THAT is often called representational, right? In other

1093
00:56:01.679 --> 00:56:04.830
words, it, it seems to accept the idea that

1094
00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.760
a what a belief is, is a certain um

1095
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.439
representation, a certain bit of information that's playing a

1096
00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:15.300
particular causal role. And perhaps in all cases on

1097
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.820
the earth, in which there are, there is nobody

1098
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.939
perhaps that relies on their notebook quite to the

1099
00:56:19.949 --> 00:56:22.679
extent. Otto does. That means that beliefs will always

1100
00:56:22.689 --> 00:56:25.260
be in here, right? But what the clock and,

1101
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.370
and Chalmers example does is show us that in

1102
00:56:27.379 --> 00:56:32.080
some special but not science fiction circumstances, some item

1103
00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:34.780
of information could play that causal role, the causal

1104
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.429
role. It has to have to count as a

1105
00:56:36.439 --> 00:56:40.449
belief from outside the head. Uh HUH. So, so

1106
00:56:40.459 --> 00:56:42.899
that's ii I take it one way of putting

1107
00:56:42.909 --> 00:56:45.060
the the main claim of the extended mind thesis

1108
00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:48.540
that beliefs could be outside the head. Um If

1109
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:51.909
we have a certain item of information playing the

1110
00:56:51.919 --> 00:56:55.500
right um uh causal role that the folk attribute

1111
00:56:55.510 --> 00:57:01.159
to, to beliefs. Um Now, um so that's, that's

1112
00:57:01.169 --> 00:57:03.239
the, so we can call that a sort of

1113
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:06.510
representation list take on the extended mind thesis because

1114
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.020
it seems to accept this basic view about what

1115
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:12.629
beliefs are and just show that given that conception

1116
00:57:12.639 --> 00:57:15.179
of beliefs as a an item of information playing

1117
00:57:15.189 --> 00:57:17.540
a certain causal role, you could in principle have

1118
00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.879
that outside the head. Of course, the fiction rejects

1119
00:57:21.889 --> 00:57:24.620
that idea. That's, that's I wouldn't say that's not

1120
00:57:24.629 --> 00:57:27.669
what beliefs are. And so that, so I now

1121
00:57:27.679 --> 00:57:29.350
have to say, well, what, what would the fictional

1122
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.840
take on this be? And again, I uh a

1123
00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.949
little bit like what I just said about mental

1124
00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:36.199
representation. I want to say that if what the

1125
00:57:36.209 --> 00:57:40.739
extended mind thesis says is, well, in most cases,

1126
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:45.719
and most actual cases anyway, um the beliefs are

1127
00:57:45.729 --> 00:57:48.489
um uh inside the head or items of mental

1128
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.790
representations playing a certain c causal role inside the

1129
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.899
head. But sometimes under special circumstances, like Otto, they

1130
00:57:55.909 --> 00:57:59.320
could extend outside. I wouldn't say, well, the fiction

1131
00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:02.129
is view is almost exactly the opposite. It says

1132
00:58:02.439 --> 00:58:06.209
really all of our talk about the mind is

1133
00:58:06.219 --> 00:58:09.570
a metaphorical projection in the other direction from the

1134
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.590
outside, in, from exter. So think about memory. Um

1135
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.040
YOU know, w we often talk about memory and

1136
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.699
this is a, a way of talking about memory

1137
00:58:17.709 --> 00:58:20.750
that stretches back. Um You know, 2000 years or

1138
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.780
so, we can talk about memory as a kind

1139
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:26.580
of information storage as, as um in other way

1140
00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:29.695
words, is we use the external practices that we

1141
00:58:29.705 --> 00:58:31.905
have for writing down and storing information as a

1142
00:58:31.915 --> 00:58:34.905
metaphor for making sense of um of what memory

1143
00:58:34.915 --> 00:58:37.864
is. Um So I think the way I would

1144
00:58:37.875 --> 00:58:39.625
put it is what Clark and Chalmers have done

1145
00:58:39.635 --> 00:58:42.695
in this example of Otto is to really nicely

1146
00:58:42.705 --> 00:58:46.614
capture one of the central metaphors that we use

1147
00:58:46.645 --> 00:58:49.225
um to talk about memory, which is roughly speaking,

1148
00:58:49.235 --> 00:58:51.445
as a sort of ever present trusty notebook that

1149
00:58:51.455 --> 00:58:52.754
we keep in, in our head where we write

1150
00:58:52.764 --> 00:58:56.959
down important information and, and move on. Um So,

1151
00:58:56.969 --> 00:58:59.199
so what is a very strange case from that

1152
00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:01.399
perspective where he's someone who literally does have a

1153
00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:03.899
notebook that he's using in that kind of way.

1154
00:59:03.909 --> 00:59:06.280
And that's why we, you know, I think they're

1155
00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.360
right to say that we find it natural to,

1156
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.459
to talk about memory in that sort of case.

1157
00:59:10.709 --> 00:59:13.530
So, so that's, that's as it were the heart

1158
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.699
of it. I want to say that the basic

1159
00:59:15.709 --> 00:59:17.679
move from the fiction list is in the opposite

1160
00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:19.919
direction to extend in my thesis. To say it's

1161
00:59:19.929 --> 00:59:24.330
really um external representations that we see that we're

1162
00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.889
familiar with that ground, our con our concept of

1163
00:59:27.899 --> 00:59:30.620
mind, even when we're talking about Inger, right? Even

1164
00:59:30.629 --> 00:59:32.810
when we, we're basically, when we say I inga

1165
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.169
um remembers where the museum is. We're basically saying

1166
00:59:36.179 --> 00:59:38.350
you can make sense of by her behavior by

1167
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.120
saying it's as if she had it written down

1168
00:59:40.129 --> 00:59:42.800
in a little notebook in her head, even though

1169
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:47.139
she doesn't print. So that's the basic story. Now,

1170
00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:48.909
what I would want to say then though is

1171
00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:52.489
that I do think there's a really important um

1172
00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:56.620
uh insight behind the extended mind thesis, which I

1173
00:59:56.629 --> 00:59:59.020
think it's really important that fiction is captures and

1174
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.280
I, I hope it does capture it, which is

1175
01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.580
to say in an enormous amount of our daily

1176
01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:09.250
activity, um we are thoroughly dependent on external tools.

1177
01:00:09.389 --> 01:00:14.050
Um And that when we attribute mental states, we

1178
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.780
talk about people understanding or, or, you know, believing

1179
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.959
or desiring and so on, we very often don't

1180
01:00:20.969 --> 01:00:24.439
mind whether as it were they have to rely

1181
01:00:24.449 --> 01:00:27.084
on those tools or not. So, so one example

1182
01:00:27.094 --> 01:00:29.334
I've written about is understanding in science. I mean,

1183
01:00:29.344 --> 01:00:32.175
it's very often the case that in order to

1184
01:00:32.185 --> 01:00:34.844
attribute what we think is required for understanding the

1185
01:00:34.854 --> 01:00:37.245
capacities that are required for that scientists have to

1186
01:00:37.254 --> 01:00:39.834
rely on pen and paper and computers and so

1187
01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.165
on. And uh and, and we're fine with that

1188
01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:45.024
in, in many, many, there are certain special circumstances

1189
01:00:45.034 --> 01:00:47.995
like exams where we might bar people from having

1190
01:00:48.014 --> 01:00:50.445
some tools but, but in many other cases not.

1191
01:00:50.455 --> 01:00:53.129
So, so what I would say is w the

1192
01:00:53.139 --> 01:00:55.550
really important insight, there's a really important insight of

1193
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.600
the extended mind thesis. And I think fiction can

1194
01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:00.939
capture that by saying, look what, what are we

1195
01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.820
doing? When we talk about the mind, we're trying

1196
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:07.679
to make sense of people's behavior and we're using

1197
01:01:07.689 --> 01:01:11.110
a certain stock of metaphors like memories, information storage,

1198
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.070
say to make sense of their behavior. But when

1199
01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.939
we do that, we often don't really mind whether

1200
01:01:17.949 --> 01:01:21.320
or not, right, in order to, to realize that

1201
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:23.770
pattern of behavior, they have to rely on using

1202
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.449
all sorts of tools and devices, right? Um So

1203
01:01:26.459 --> 01:01:28.520
you can imagine a case in which Otto say

1204
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:30.669
is really nervous when he wanders around a big

1205
01:01:30.679 --> 01:01:33.530
city. So imagine he doesn't have the notebook, but

1206
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.850
he has a stress ball on him. Right. So,

1207
01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.010
uh and I I in a big city, he's

1208
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.810
fine if he's got his stress ball to keep

1209
01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:43.080
him calm. Um But not otherwise. So, so in

1210
01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.280
this case, it might be that we can make

1211
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.320
sense of Otto's behavior by saying, um, well, he

1212
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.810
knows where the museum is, even if he's having

1213
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.080
to rely on this external device, in order to

1214
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.439
realize the right pattern of behavior, like walking to

1215
01:01:55.449 --> 01:01:57.639
the, the correct street and so on, or you

1216
01:01:57.649 --> 01:01:59.719
can think of all sorts of other cases, you

1217
01:01:59.729 --> 01:02:01.959
know, he has a map on him which he

1218
01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:04.320
can look at, it doesn't have the name of

1219
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.159
the museum written down, say that he just needs

1220
01:02:06.169 --> 01:02:08.560
to look at it and sort of orientate himself.

1221
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.870
So again, he may realize the right pattern of

1222
01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:15.610
behavior to count as, um uh you know, believing

1223
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.879
that the museum is on 53rd street where it

1224
01:02:17.889 --> 01:02:20.939
is. Um, HE can't do that, let's say without

1225
01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.270
the device, but with something like a map to

1226
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.250
orientate himself or a stress ball to keep him

1227
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.139
calm. What have you, he can. And I think

1228
01:02:27.149 --> 01:02:29.870
in everyday life, you'd be fine saying, you know,

1229
01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.709
we're gonna meet Otto at the museum. Does he

1230
01:02:31.719 --> 01:02:34.389
know where it is? Yes, that's fine. And you

1231
01:02:34.399 --> 01:02:38.429
wouldn't uh take back that, that attribution if you

1232
01:02:38.439 --> 01:02:40.199
knew that he had to have a street map

1233
01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:42.389
on him. I think that's um so I think

1234
01:02:42.399 --> 01:02:44.360
there is a really important, it's a long answer.

1235
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.860
I think there's a, a really important insight here

1236
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.489
in the extended mind, thesis about the thoroughness of

1237
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:54.379
our dependence on um tools and external representations in

1238
01:02:54.389 --> 01:02:57.659
order to display certain capacities where I think it

1239
01:02:57.669 --> 01:03:00.290
goes wrong, at least in the canonical form in

1240
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.560
Clark. And Chalmers is by um assuming the representational

1241
01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:06.889
list conception of mind. And I think you can,

1242
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.560
you can as it were ditch the representational is

1243
01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.169
but keep the important lesson of the extended mind

1244
01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:15.040
thesis and, and doing that, I think you avoid

1245
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.159
some problems.

1246
01:03:16.479 --> 01:03:19.770
Yeah. By the way, I'm curious since there are

1247
01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.439
people nowadays that use the extended mind thesis and

1248
01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:26.239
apply it in the broader framework that they call

1249
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:30.320
the four e cognition. So apart from the extended

1250
01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:34.114
bit, there's also the better than bodied and enacted

1251
01:03:34.385 --> 01:03:39.024
mind. Do you think that fictional is, would have

1252
01:03:39.074 --> 01:03:42.804
anything at all to say about the other three

1253
01:03:42.814 --> 01:03:46.395
s or that perhaps they would uh there are

1254
01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:49.504
some insights from them that would also apply to

1255
01:03:49.514 --> 01:03:50.215
fictional.

1256
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.580
That's a, yeah, that's a really good question. It's

1257
01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:56.219
quite a big question because you're quite right to

1258
01:03:56.229 --> 01:03:58.989
say that I focused on the Clark and Chalmers

1259
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.439
paper from uh you know, 25 years ago. Now,

1260
01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:06.280
um there is now, of course, AAA huge movement

1261
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:09.040
um that comes under that heading of for recognition

1262
01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:13.489
and, and uh even though the movement might share

1263
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.790
the general emphasis on thinking that a kind of

1264
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.780
internal is, is a mistake. In other words, a

1265
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.909
view that says it's all about the brain, somehow

1266
01:04:20.919 --> 01:04:22.629
it's a mistake and we should emphasize body and

1267
01:04:22.639 --> 01:04:27.550
environment. There are big theoretical differences between um different

1268
01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.149
views there. So, so I probably won't be able

1269
01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:33.189
to, to encompass it at all. I certainly won't.

1270
01:04:33.199 --> 01:04:39.919
Um uh I suppose um that um one thing

1271
01:04:39.929 --> 01:04:41.530
to say would be so if we think about

1272
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:47.600
something like the embedded versus extended conception, roughly speaking,

1273
01:04:47.909 --> 01:04:53.090
um they um both seem to make sense of

1274
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.209
um they both seem to rather to assume something

1275
01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:59.689
um that I think that we perhaps shouldn't assume.

1276
01:04:59.699 --> 01:05:02.050
Um And that is that, for instance, it makes

1277
01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.310
sense to ask where beliefs are. So, so one

1278
01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.699
way in which I think the extended mind position

1279
01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.590
gets in trouble is people say, well, it's very

1280
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.709
strange to say that a belief could be in

1281
01:05:12.719 --> 01:05:14.780
a notebook. That seems a very strange thing to

1282
01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:17.780
say. And that's quite right. So that, that even

1283
01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:20.179
though I've said the folk don't really care that

1284
01:05:20.189 --> 01:05:22.800
much often about whether we rely on external devices.

1285
01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.870
It does sound weird to say a belief is

1286
01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.639
in a notebook. I guess what I would want

1287
01:05:27.649 --> 01:05:29.699
to say is the, the fault there lies with

1288
01:05:29.709 --> 01:05:33.879
representational is not with the extended idea. So I

1289
01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:36.550
think it's just as strange to say, is my

1290
01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.860
belief that Derby is in England on the left

1291
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:40.399
or the right side of my head. So I'm

1292
01:05:40.409 --> 01:05:42.580
getting confused now because I'm looking in a, uh,

1293
01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:45.050
the camera. So I don't, II, I promise, I

1294
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.139
do know my left or my right. But, um,

1295
01:05:47.169 --> 01:05:48.790
you know, that the real one I'm trying to

1296
01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.639
say is I think talking about where beliefs are,

1297
01:05:51.649 --> 01:05:54.810
is a strange um uh thing to do, right?

1298
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.050
That that's at odds with our ordinary conception of

1299
01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.379
belief. That's of course one thing the jewelers would

1300
01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.709
say, they'd say, yeah, they're not, they're not in

1301
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.129
uh space in the way that tables and chairs

1302
01:06:04.139 --> 01:06:05.939
are. But I think the right and the right

1303
01:06:05.949 --> 01:06:08.590
reason to give for why that sounds strange is

1304
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.719
cos we're speaking metaphorically. So, um example I mentioned

1305
01:06:11.729 --> 01:06:13.320
in the book you say about someone, oh, he's

1306
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.159
got such a chip on his shoulder and you

1307
01:06:15.169 --> 01:06:18.280
say, oh, really? Right or left shoulder right. Now,

1308
01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.000
if you say that it looks like what you've

1309
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:23.969
done is push a certain metaphor too close to

1310
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:26.000
literal, right? Um And I think the same is

1311
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.169
true about asking where beliefs are, whether that's right

1312
01:06:29.179 --> 01:06:31.129
or left side of the skull or in notebooks

1313
01:06:31.139 --> 01:06:33.280
or outside and so on. So, so that's just

1314
01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:35.389
to give one example of it looks on the

1315
01:06:35.399 --> 01:06:37.669
face of it like the dividing line between someone

1316
01:06:37.679 --> 01:06:40.770
who's an extended uh mind person and someone who's

1317
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.750
embedded is um that they both admit the importance

1318
01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.419
of the environment. But one of them thinks that

1319
01:06:46.429 --> 01:06:48.929
the mind literally extends outside the head and the

1320
01:06:48.939 --> 01:06:50.679
other one doesn't. And I wouldn't say, I think

1321
01:06:50.689 --> 01:06:53.955
the whole thought about the whole question of where

1322
01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:57.735
the mind is located is um in a way

1323
01:06:57.745 --> 01:07:01.695
a kind of um follow on from Cartesian is

1324
01:07:01.705 --> 01:07:03.824
a sort of implication of Cartesian is that we

1325
01:07:03.834 --> 01:07:06.514
should um that we should reject the mind isn't

1326
01:07:06.524 --> 01:07:10.235
really anywhere um in that sense that, that they,

1327
01:07:10.245 --> 01:07:13.445
that they need um perhaps just one more thing

1328
01:07:13.455 --> 01:07:15.584
to, to mention would be something like in activism.

1329
01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:18.469
And II, I think um of course, there are

1330
01:07:18.479 --> 01:07:21.120
different forms of in activism too, but at least

1331
01:07:21.129 --> 01:07:25.100
one form that um associated with, with authors like

1332
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.550
Dan Hatto and E mind would be the, the

1333
01:07:27.929 --> 01:07:31.979
also a view that is, is um skeptical about

1334
01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:35.070
inner representations, at least in at least in some,

1335
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.679
some cases. And I think there, there is a,

1336
01:07:37.689 --> 01:07:41.909
an important parallel with fictional is probably the key

1337
01:07:41.919 --> 01:07:45.370
difference is that I am a little bit more

1338
01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:48.570
conservative in allowing uh people to still carry on

1339
01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.649
talking about, you know, representations as long as they,

1340
01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:54.610
they're careful not to take it too seriously. In

1341
01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.939
other words, one way to put that would perhaps

1342
01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:00.000
a bit too simplistic would be to say that

1343
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.790
some expressions of an activism are more likely limit

1344
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.070
is about inner representation that we need to learn

1345
01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.784
to do without this in cognitive science. Whereas I

1346
01:08:07.794 --> 01:08:11.375
guess because of perhaps because of being someone who's

1347
01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:13.774
worked on models in science in the past, I'm

1348
01:08:13.784 --> 01:08:16.495
I'm more comfortable with the thought that um an

1349
01:08:16.504 --> 01:08:19.055
awful lot of the representations we use in science

1350
01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:21.265
are things that we know are not strictly speaking

1351
01:08:21.274 --> 01:08:25.095
true and perhaps taken literally have problems. But we,

1352
01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:27.415
we cope with that and we still use them

1353
01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:30.575
for various purposes. And I think roughly speaking, I'd

1354
01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:33.375
want to say that about inner representations as well.

1355
01:08:33.654 --> 01:08:37.009
Yeah, great. So I have one last topic that

1356
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.259
I would like to ask you about. You also

1357
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:42.720
refer to it in the book. Uh You also

1358
01:08:42.729 --> 01:08:46.020
talk tackle it in the book actually. So uh

1359
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:51.379
dealing with epistemology, then uh does our view of

1360
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:56.220
the mind shape how, for example, we approach the

1361
01:08:56.229 --> 01:09:00.680
nature of human knowledge, the nature of inquiry, inquiry,

1362
01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:05.870
basically what sort of implications would fictional is, for

1363
01:09:05.879 --> 01:09:09.109
example, have for epistemology?

1364
01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:12.549
Yeah. Thank you. II, I think it does. And

1365
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.319
I think that um uh it's perhaps AAA slightly

1366
01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:19.859
strange feature of a, a sort of philosophical landscape

1367
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:22.870
at the moment that that quite often um not

1368
01:09:22.879 --> 01:09:26.990
always but quite often debate, say in epistemology um

1369
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.729
happens fairly independently from say philosophy of mind. And,

1370
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.279
and if you think back, of course, to some

1371
01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:35.149
people like the British empiricists, um that, that would

1372
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.930
seem quite, quite strange. Um THAT really understanding the

1373
01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:40.770
nature of human knowledge was part and parcel of

1374
01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:44.450
understanding the mind and its limits. Um And I

1375
01:09:44.459 --> 01:09:48.810
suppose that uh it seems to, to me that,

1376
01:09:48.819 --> 01:09:51.520
that the notion of mind as an inner world

1377
01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:56.410
is not only, of course, um as we said

1378
01:09:56.419 --> 01:09:58.660
earlier is not only part and parcel of the

1379
01:09:58.669 --> 01:10:01.089
way that we think about the mind in philosophy

1380
01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:03.669
and, and um and everyday life, but, but also

1381
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.439
part and parcel of how we think about the

1382
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:10.180
whole. Um It were the modern challenge for um

1383
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:13.180
epistemology, you know, if as it's often said, it's,

1384
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:16.299
it's with the early modern period, particularly with Descartes,

1385
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:20.540
that knowledge becomes the central problem for philosophy. The

1386
01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:23.569
way that that becomes a problem is often thought

1387
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.359
of in terms of this inner world, you know,

1388
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:28.350
and that we are as it were somehow locked

1389
01:10:28.359 --> 01:10:31.779
up inside our inner world. And we ask ourselves,

1390
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.859
well, how do we know what's outside of that?

1391
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.709
How do we know there are other people? How

1392
01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.089
do we know that there's a, an external world

1393
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.120
or what form it takes and so on. So,

1394
01:10:40.279 --> 01:10:43.160
so arguably that, that notion of inner world is

1395
01:10:43.169 --> 01:10:47.000
sort of lies right at the heart of um

1396
01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:51.029
the um the whole conception that, that we have

1397
01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.479
of what um the problems of philosophy or particularly

1398
01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:56.399
the problems of knowledge are in the, in the

1399
01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:00.759
modern period. Um And, and, and I if you

1400
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:03.080
think of, say someone like Hume, you know, what,

1401
01:11:03.089 --> 01:11:05.779
what is uh what is the response to that?

1402
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:09.029
Well, it's to try to understand the operations of

1403
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.359
our inner world, as I say in something like

1404
01:11:11.629 --> 01:11:13.729
uh uh and being something like a newton of

1405
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.629
the mind in order to understand what we can

1406
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.509
talk sensibly about what concepts we can have um

1407
01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.029
uh where we're talking nonsense. Um And what the

1408
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.669
limits of our knowledge can, can be now. So

1409
01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.620
that means that if you reject that idea of

1410
01:11:31.629 --> 01:11:34.459
mind as an inner world, then epistemology and enquiry

1411
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.740
looks very different. And roughly speaking, one really important

1412
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.740
implication, I think of thinking about the mind in,

1413
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.720
in the sort of way that I've tried to,

1414
01:11:44.729 --> 01:11:46.540
to set out is that you will think that

1415
01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:49.339
mind has a history. In other words, you'll think

1416
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:52.259
that it's not as it were that we have

1417
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:56.459
um a particular um largely fixed inner world with

1418
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:59.660
certain operations that, that um tell us what we

1419
01:11:59.669 --> 01:12:02.750
can uh talk sensibly about what we can know

1420
01:12:02.759 --> 01:12:06.620
and so on. It's more that um we have

1421
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:11.140
during the course of our history um created all

1422
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:14.319
sorts of external devices and tools, right from, you

1423
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.700
know, ancient Greek mathematics up to computer simulations and

1424
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:22.859
so on that expand the range of capacities that

1425
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:27.649
we have for um describing the world, for predicting

1426
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.319
it for um understanding it and so on. And

1427
01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:34.700
so the, the, the, as it were charting the,

1428
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:36.750
the nature and the limits of the human mind

1429
01:12:36.759 --> 01:12:41.015
is about charting a whole complex set of practices

1430
01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:44.694
that are built up over the course of generations

1431
01:12:44.705 --> 01:12:48.995
and generations and involve keep incorporating more and more

1432
01:12:49.084 --> 01:12:54.694
um sorts of um uh devices, tools, representations and,

1433
01:12:54.705 --> 01:12:58.209
and so on. Um And that, that, that really

1434
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.649
understanding the nature of enquiries about understanding those practices.

1435
01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:04.970
And that really, that's what an awful lot of

1436
01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:08.830
our um uh concepts that we use in epistemology,

1437
01:13:08.839 --> 01:13:12.020
like knowledge and understanding and inference. That's really what

1438
01:13:12.029 --> 01:13:15.870
they're describing, they're describing those complex practices of interaction

1439
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.770
um with tools in certain social environments,

1440
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:23.229
right? So this is probably a good point to

1441
01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.709
end on. Uh And the book is again mine

1442
01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.379
as a metaphor, a defense of mental fictional is

1443
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:31.549
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1444
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.330
box of the interview and Doctor Tun just before

1445
01:13:34.339 --> 01:13:37.189
we go apart from the book, would you like

1446
01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.919
to tell people where they can find you and

1447
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:41.310
your work on the internet?

1448
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:45.069
Ah Well, um So AAA good question if you

1449
01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:48.490
um uh you go to my website. So if

1450
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.459
you search for me, you'll find my University of

1451
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:53.959
Exeter web pages. Um And I suppose that the

1452
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.379
perhaps the the most interesting thing for, for people,

1453
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.870
if, if they've made it to the end of

1454
01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:02.229
this interview, uh might be a link that's included

1455
01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.229
there to um some lectures I I gave called

1456
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.620
the Frega lectures at the University of Tartu in

1457
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:11.500
December last year. Um And those lectures were based

1458
01:14:11.509 --> 01:14:14.270
on um the book and cover a lot of

1459
01:14:14.279 --> 01:14:16.339
the topics that we've talked about in more depth.

1460
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:18.259
So, so if people are interested, if you go

1461
01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:19.899
to my website and follow that link, it will

1462
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:21.540
direct you to the University of Tartu and you

1463
01:14:21.549 --> 01:14:24.410
can um watch recordings of those of those lectures.

1464
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:27.890
Great. Uh I will add that to the description

1465
01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:30.750
box of the interview then and Doctor Tun, thank

1466
01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:32.669
