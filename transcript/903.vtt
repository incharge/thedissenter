00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.849
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.570
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricard Loup. And

3
00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.820
today I'm joined for a second time by Doctor

4
00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.890
Luis Favela, associate Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences

5
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.779
at the University of Central Florida. And today we're

6
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.540
talking about his book, The Ecological Brain Unifying The

7
00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:22.059
Sciences of Brain, body and Environment. And by the

8
00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.530
way, I'm leaving a link to our first interview

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.389
in the description box down below which is which

10
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.899
to a certain extent is also relevant to the

11
00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.209
interview today. So Doctor Favela, welcome back to the

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.020
show. It's always a pleasure to talk to you.

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.299
Thank you Ricardo. I appreciate the invitation looking forward

14
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.669
to it.

15
00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:42.400
So I, I mean, the way I would like

16
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.900
to go through things here today is that uh

17
00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.240
first of all, I would like to get into

18
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.090
what ecological psychology and neuroscience are because those are

19
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:55.110
the two main disciplines that you explore in the

20
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.669
book and also the relationship between them and how

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.849
they historically sort of came apart theoretically, methodologically and

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.839
so on and then get into the framework that

23
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:09.309
you bring into the book that you present there

24
00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:13.050
that perhaps can bring them back together and perhaps

25
00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:17.220
other aspects of our psychology. And so to start

26
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.720
off with what is ecological psychology? Really?

27
00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:26.059
Yeah. So I think when, um, people hear the

28
00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.589
term ecological psychology, I think if they think of

29
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.269
anything they think of, um, psychology related to the

30
00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.190
environment. And so commonly when I talk to people,

31
00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:39.360
they've said, oh, so you study, uh how productive

32
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.430
people are depending on what color their room is.

33
00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.099
So if their room is painted red, then that

34
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.690
means the ecology causes them to be angry and

35
00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:50.809
agitated. And I'm like, well, maybe, but that's not

36
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.330
what we mean here in this case. So, uh

37
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.690
when I say ecological psychology, I'm referring to a

38
00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:01.250
tradition and perceptual psychology uh that originates with James

39
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.139
Gibson in the mid 20th century around the 19

40
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.919
fifties. Um And also with his uh spouse Eleanor

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.080
Gibson, also around at the same time. So ecological

42
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:16.100
psychology was a bit of a reaction to um

43
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.080
the uh more popular um or increasingly popular approaches

44
00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.990
to perception uh around the mid 20th century. And

45
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.979
so around that time, you had something called the

46
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.339
cognitive revolution. And so the cognitive revolution was pushing

47
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.729
back against uh behaviorist approaches. And so behaviorism in

48
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.800
the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds argued that

49
00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.440
um if there's anything to, to a mind or

50
00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.759
to be mental, really, what matters for a scientific

51
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.320
study of that is what can be observed in

52
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.720
behavior. And so the idea was we can try

53
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.580
to explain even the most complex behaviors by things

54
00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:59.380
like a, a reflex or stimulus response uh rules

55
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
um that an organism develops over its lifetime or

56
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.750
even over eve evolutionary time scales, the cognitive revolution

57
00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.919
came along and said, well, that's, you know, kind

58
00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:11.550
of interesting and you can explain a lot of

59
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.910
stuff that way, but there seems to be a

60
00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.610
lot of mental things happening that you can't explain

61
00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.839
just by looking at the environment and then the,

62
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.729
the response that the organism has. And so Noam

63
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.860
Chomsky has this famous pushback argument against behaviorism uh

64
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:31.940
where he said, um the environment is too impoverished,

65
00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:37.615
it's too poor with information for uh example, language

66
00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:41.175
learning. So an infant that's starting to learn language,

67
00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:43.934
um even if it's exposed much of the day

68
00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.875
to his parents talking and family talking, that doesn't

69
00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:49.774
seem to be enough to account for the richness

70
00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:53.345
and the seemingly infinite combination of words that a

71
00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:56.475
human being learns how to use. And so Chomsky

72
00:03:56.485 --> 00:03:59.710
and others that came along later. So there must

73
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.899
be some things that are already built into the

74
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.580
mind. And so, yeah, maybe there's stimulus in the

75
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.570
environment and then there are responses from the organism,

76
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.410
but those responses are gonna be based on innate

77
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.289
structures that are already in the brain. And so

78
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.545
the launched a whole new paradigm, if you will

79
00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:19.923
a whole new way of doing psychology which said,

80
00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:21.714
we don't have to treat the inside of the

81
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:24.005
organism like a black box, right? Where you have

82
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.964
your input, some magic happens and then you get

83
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.934
an output. No, we can start looking at those

84
00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:32.799
structures. And around that time also what became popular

85
00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:37.239
was uh computers. So the computational devices were becoming

86
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.649
more and more popular. And people said, wow, you

87
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.940
know, computers, they, they, they have these like internal

88
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.890
rules and they can, you know, give them certain

89
00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:47.359
kind of inputs and they get really complex outputs

90
00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:48.769
and it seems like you can mix that up

91
00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.220
and almost infinite ways. And so that there was

92
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.859
a marriage between these different approaches, um artificial intelligence

93
00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:58.920
at the time, linguistics and some other sub fields

94
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:00.750
as well. And they came together and they said,

95
00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:04.940
well, then things like perception must also require some

96
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.880
internal uh properties as well. And so you can't

97
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.750
really explain something like detecting distance just based on

98
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.609
the stimulus. Because for example, if you had a

99
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.269
little tree that was up close to you or

100
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.910
you had a big tree that was far away

101
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.359
from you, if all that it requires for vision

102
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.269
is the information and the environment. Well, the little

103
00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.350
tree and the big tree on the same line

104
00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:37.790
would cast the same image on your retinal cells.

105
00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:39.220
So you wouldn't be able to tell they would

106
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.260
look the same spot. Thus, we must have certain

107
00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:45.339
rules in our mind that allows us to maybe

108
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.149
take cues from the environment. Um uh We see

109
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.059
things that maybe, maybe in the angles of shadows

110
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.059
or something like that might tell us that something

111
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.980
is further away than it is closer. So computers

112
00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:01.809
and the idea that you would represent the environment

113
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.570
in your mind and then manipulate it computationally. This

114
00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:06.619
became the dominant way of doing things in the

115
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.779
mid 20th century. Well, here comes ecological psychology, sorry

116
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.049
for all the history, but you kind of need

117
00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.820
to know some of that to, to appreciate what

118
00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:15.820
Gibson was doing.

119
00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:18.149
A and by the way, just to mention that

120
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.179
in our first interview, we talked more extensively about

121
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.505
computational representational approaches. So we if people want to

122
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:30.125
go back there and watch that be that bit

123
00:06:30.135 --> 00:06:34.005
again because it provides even more con context, I

124
00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:36.445
guess to what we're talking about here. So,

125
00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:40.584
yeah, exactly. Yeah. Thank you, Ricardo. Um So Gibson

126
00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:43.959
said, well, um he was, he was actually he

127
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.510
was a, a scientist uh in the army and

128
00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:49.470
in, in the US military. And he was um

129
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.059
tasked with trying to help develop training better training

130
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.309
methods for pilots because he said pilots, they were

131
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.329
treating uh the environment like a Cartesian coordinate system

132
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.279
where it's just abstract kind of space of three

133
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.915
dimensions on an A season. So uh if you

134
00:07:06.924 --> 00:07:09.845
want to land your plane and survive, uh you

135
00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:11.765
want to think of yourself as one point in

136
00:07:11.774 --> 00:07:15.315
that coordinate system and then the landing field and

137
00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:18.045
the plane and another part of that coordinate system,

138
00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:20.234
and then you try and calculate that. Well, it

139
00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:22.744
turns out the pilots were really bad at learning

140
00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:25.964
to fly that way. So he said, well, what

141
00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:29.195
do pilots actually do when they land successfully? He

142
00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:32.489
said they actually pay attention to what the environment

143
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.130
is doing in relation to themselves. And so he

144
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.670
picked up on the notion of optic flow as

145
00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:41.450
something that guides uh the ability of pilots to

146
00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:43.459
land. And he said, maybe if we train the

147
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.709
pilots to focus on optic flow, so that's when

148
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.290
the environment is moving in your your space of

149
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.589
vision. If we tell them focus on the optic

150
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.339
flow of the runway, and we try and coordinate

151
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.010
our sense of our body in relation to that

152
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.440
optic flow, maybe people will land better and it

153
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.160
turns out that it did, it worked out better

154
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.325
for them to think of things in, in that

155
00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:06.994
sense instead of the abstract sense. So this is

156
00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:10.494
one of the early also approaches um that became

157
00:08:10.505 --> 00:08:13.885
known as embodied cognition or embodied mind, the idea

158
00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:16.334
that you get your sense of body or your

159
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:19.204
app proprioception and your haptic senses as a way

160
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:22.595
of gaining information about the world. And so what

161
00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:25.785
did Gibson then do from this simple lesson? He

162
00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:30.179
said, well, maybe, maybe the environment actually is rich

163
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.969
with information, maybe um organisms don't represent the world

164
00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.969
in their minds as much as we think they

165
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:40.119
do if at all, maybe what they do is

166
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.679
they leverage things like optic flow or the ambient

167
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.099
light in a room or things like that. And

168
00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.739
so how do we know that the little tree

169
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.799
is up close and the big tree is further

170
00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:56.489
away? Well, we know that because of information in

171
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.409
the environment like parallax, the parallax is what happens

172
00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:04.049
when something uh is up close. And if you're

173
00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:06.830
moving, it seems like it's moving faster. If something

174
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.869
is far away and you're moving at the same

175
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.219
speed, it seems like it's moving slower. So if

176
00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:13.590
you've been in a car or on a train

177
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.950
and you look outside and you look down and

178
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.549
you see the road moving really fast, but then

179
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:20.070
you look at the distance and it looks like

180
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.724
the mountains are barely moving at all. That's parallax.

181
00:09:23.844 --> 00:09:26.965
And that information is in the environment. It's nothing

182
00:09:26.974 --> 00:09:29.455
that's represented in the brain or in the mind.

183
00:09:29.744 --> 00:09:32.505
So Gibson launched this whole new approach to doing

184
00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:36.594
perceptual psychology based on the idea that the environment

185
00:09:36.604 --> 00:09:40.234
is not impoverished the way Chomsky and the cognitive

186
00:09:40.244 --> 00:09:43.765
revolution uh neuros or scientists said, but that we

187
00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:48.114
can actually use the environment to um inform even

188
00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:52.090
complex actions. And so from there, here's the last

189
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:55.359
main bit from there, he developed the term uh

190
00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:59.059
affordances. And so I think uh this is a

191
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.190
common term now outside of ecological psychology, roboticists, people

192
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.919
in education, all sorts of different people in art

193
00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:10.789
design, they use the term afford it uh loosely

194
00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:13.520
what it means is opportunities to do things in

195
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.200
the world. So when I see this cup in

196
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.729
front of me with little paints of Nietzsche on

197
00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:24.500
it, it affords grasping if the features of the

198
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.179
object and my body have a nice match, right?

199
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.840
If the cup is too tiny for my fingers

200
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:33.280
or if it's gigantic and I can't grab it,

201
00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:36.880
then it does not afford grasping. And so Gibson

202
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.539
said, it's likely that any organism that is perceiving

203
00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:44.640
the world from a little ant to a grasshopper

204
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.400
to a dog, to a chimp to a human

205
00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:51.520
is likely perceiving opportunities to do things in the

206
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:57.200
world. And those opportunities are constrained by the organisms

207
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.640
sense of its body. So it's embodiment and then

208
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:05.039
information in the environment. So that's what ecological psychology

209
00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:07.239
in this case boils down to the idea of

210
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:11.109
an organism, environment system that can act intelligently in

211
00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:14.859
the world based on embodiment and environmental or ecological

212
00:11:14.869 --> 00:11:15.590
information.

213
00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:21.429
And so that's about ecological psychology. But then how

214
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.169
does neuroscience get into the picture of what you

215
00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:28.909
explore in your book? Uh Perhaps, I mean, we

216
00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:32.150
have to go through some of the main historical

217
00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:37.140
developments here as well uh to then understand why

218
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.039
it is that psychology uh or ecological psychology and

219
00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:46.619
neuroscience uh theoretically conceptually and methodologically, at least at

220
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.200
first sight seem irreconcilable.

221
00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:53.409
Yeah. So the uh historical story that I try

222
00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:56.570
to tell uh in the book is one in

223
00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.659
which you've got multiple strands of research happening uh

224
00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:04.059
investigating mind in different ways. Um So there are

225
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.030
people do perceptual psychology, for example, you know, there

226
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:11.729
are gyps ecological psychology, cognitive psychologists and the like

227
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.260
and so, neuroscience. Um uh AND again, this is

228
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.710
just painting in broad strokes, right? So there's always

229
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:20.960
gonna be exceptions and things like that. But painting

230
00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:24.500
in broad strokes, neuroscience is very much um what

231
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.080
I'll call it a anatomical or physiological discipline. I

232
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.179
was interested in what are the um the bodily

233
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.340
constituents of the nervous system, right? What are, what

234
00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:37.510
are nerve cells? What are neurons? What are glial

235
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.549
cells? How do they work? How do they act?

236
00:12:39.929 --> 00:12:43.409
And so fast forwarding a bit. How do those

237
00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:47.780
anatomical units connect to things like intelligent behavior or

238
00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:51.619
memory or problem solving? And so, as I try

239
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.289
to tell in the book Neuroscience, especially things like

240
00:12:55.299 --> 00:12:59.570
Perceptual Neuroscience or cognitive neuroscience, things more concerned with

241
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.090
um the type of phenomena that are studied in

242
00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:07.369
psychology, for example, um they inherited a lot of

243
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.549
the uh theoretical approaches from the cognitive revolution. So

244
00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:16.590
the cognitive revolution sparked this approach which uh we

245
00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:20.929
call cognitive and cognitive is was the idea that

246
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:27.799
cognition, uh intelligent behavior, perception, memory, um the control

247
00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:31.559
of movement, co-ordinated movement. All these things are essentially

248
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.840
computational and representational in nature. And So as I

249
00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:38.750
mentioned a few minutes ago, the idea is that

250
00:13:38.849 --> 00:13:41.479
uh it's not just stimulus from the environment and

251
00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:44.859
response uh from whatever is happening in the body.

252
00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:46.239
And you don't need to pay attention to what's

253
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.940
happening in the brain, right? The black box. But

254
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.640
inside here are computations that are manipulating representations. So

255
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.479
when I speak a language, I have representations of

256
00:13:57.489 --> 00:14:01.489
words and sounds, the computations organize those in certain

257
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.119
ways that give me uh language comprehension, for example.

258
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.969
So as I argue in the book, Neuroscience inherited

259
00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:15.330
this way of thinking about uh organisms as these

260
00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:19.859
brains or neurons or nervous systems that are conducting

261
00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:24.000
computations and they're manipulating representations of the world. And

262
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.619
so when you think about a computer that manipulates

263
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.710
bits like ones and zeros, right? So whenever you

264
00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:33.169
write a computer program, it's made up of strings

265
00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:35.559
of ones and zeros and certain kinds of ones

266
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.940
and zeros give you a tiktok video or one

267
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.929
gives you music or one gives you a game

268
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.630
you're gonna play, it's all still ones and zeros.

269
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.419
And so the idea was that neurons which were

270
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.289
thought of as simple firing units. So they either

271
00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:53.609
fire or they don't. So they set off an

272
00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:59.119
action potential. Maybe theoretically speaking, neuroscientists are history club,

273
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.440
maybe those spikes can be thought of as like

274
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.940
a one. And when it's not spiking, it's like

275
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.840
a zero and so taken together, you know, these

276
00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:10.780
millions and millions of spiking ones and zeros are

277
00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:13.270
like the millions and millions of zeros and ones

278
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.650
in a computer. And so the brain must be

279
00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:21.515
a kind of computational device. So Neuroscience inherits this

280
00:15:21.525 --> 00:15:25.234
way of thinking about thinking uh thinking about nervous

281
00:15:25.244 --> 00:15:28.994
systems as essentially a kind of wet computer, right?

282
00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:31.034
It's not made out of silicon, like my macbook,

283
00:15:31.044 --> 00:15:33.354
but it's made out of, you know, cells and

284
00:15:33.364 --> 00:15:35.585
blood and water and proteins and all this kind

285
00:15:35.594 --> 00:15:38.354
of stuff. But essentially it's doing the same thing

286
00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:41.539
as a computer. Now. Where did the split come

287
00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:45.940
in between neuroscience and ecological psychology? Well, right from

288
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.049
the beginning, right, from the start, there's a big

289
00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:52.760
split and the big split is that neuroscience inherits

290
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.440
this view that the environment is too impoverished to

291
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.799
provide a kind of information that can guide intelligent

292
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:03.960
action, for example, whereas the ecological psychologist says the

293
00:16:03.969 --> 00:16:08.340
environment is rich with information which can guide intelligent

294
00:16:08.349 --> 00:16:11.380
behavior and action. And so right there from the

295
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.419
start, you have one fundamental break that happens right

296
00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:19.700
there. The neuroscience test is put in uh their,

297
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.130
their bets on the cognitive this theory and they're

298
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.280
saying it's gonna be all about what's happening in

299
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:26.539
the brain or the, or the, you know, cognitive

300
00:16:26.549 --> 00:16:30.780
system. The ecological psychologist is gonna say actually what's

301
00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.650
gonna happen is it's gonna be distributed throughout the

302
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:37.119
body, which includes a brain, but mostly the overt

303
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.309
kind of gross body and the environment itself. So

304
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.450
they're coming at some of the same targets of

305
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:47.510
investigation, like visual perception, for example, and they are

306
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.479
coming from very different uh starting points and theoretical

307
00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:54.849
commitments. And so you see that at least since

308
00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:59.140
maybe the 19 seventies or so 19 eighties, that

309
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.070
this big split between these two approaches and it

310
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.689
would seem that they are irreconcilable. They're, they're in

311
00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:07.380
some ways, as I say in the book, in

312
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.489
some ways, they are different worlds, right? For the

313
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.618
ecological psychologist, the world is full of affordances and

314
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.310
rich information that's real, right? For the neuroscientists, right?

315
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.618
What's really real is what's happening in the mind

316
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.930
which equals the brain. And so this is just

317
00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:29.459
very radical ways of, of approaching um doing the

318
00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:30.589
same kind of work.

319
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.329
And by the way related to those theoretical slash

320
00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:41.160
conceptual foundations that differ between ecological psychology and neuroscience,

321
00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:43.449
one of the things that you also explore in

322
00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:47.219
the book, in this case regarding neuroscience is that

323
00:17:47.229 --> 00:17:52.180
you talk about two different traditions in neuroscience. And

324
00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:54.569
uh I would like you to tell us about

325
00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:59.405
them and then perhaps explain why does it matter

326
00:17:59.415 --> 00:18:01.594
in the context of your book? So one of

327
00:18:01.604 --> 00:18:05.984
them is focused on biological features of neurons that

328
00:18:05.994 --> 00:18:09.765
is the Hodgkin Ley tradition. And the other one

329
00:18:09.814 --> 00:18:14.834
more on abstract features of neurons, the mccullough pits

330
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:18.704
tradition. So what are those traditions really about in

331
00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:21.055
what ways do they differ? And why does it

332
00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:24.395
matter for your book specifically?

333
00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:27.160
Yeah, great, great um question. I'm glad you, you

334
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.420
asked that. So, as I said, the earlier days

335
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.680
of neuroscience that I presented in the book and

336
00:18:32.689 --> 00:18:36.890
this very broad sketches, it's very focused on anatomy

337
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.689
uh and looking at what the anatomy itself is

338
00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:43.180
like. And so uh Hodgkin and Huxley did this

339
00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:46.890
pioneering work um in the, you know, mid 20th

340
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.050
century where they created some of the earlier models

341
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.824
of single neuron activity. And so they looked at

342
00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:57.775
uh squid neurons. Um uh SQUID was a a

343
00:18:57.785 --> 00:19:00.204
great case because their neurons and their axons were

344
00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:02.494
so big that they could actually feed them with

345
00:19:02.505 --> 00:19:05.334
uh very simple microscopes. They wouldn't need these like

346
00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.984
high powered electron microscope. So they could test the

347
00:19:07.994 --> 00:19:10.045
anatomy in a in a in a in a

348
00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:14.540
pretty broad, highly detailed way. And what they focused

349
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.160
on was what are the contributions of different kind

350
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.680
of molecular activity, calcium, uh things like that. Um

351
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.510
And what's happening when the cell is acting in

352
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.349
a way to say, make you know, the tentacle

353
00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:30.390
move or something like that. What they found was

354
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.989
this is a very dynamic kind of activity, right?

355
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.319
This is a temporal activity, right? So there's time

356
00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:39.869
before the neuron fires and there's build up and

357
00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.270
there's activity and and say the calcium channels and

358
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.699
things like that in there and then it hits

359
00:19:44.709 --> 00:19:46.189
a certain point and then boom, you get the

360
00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:48.739
spike of activity and then it kind of dissipates

361
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.790
and it's prepared for another spike, right? And so

362
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.900
this was a very temporal kind of way of

363
00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.800
thinking about it. So earlier days of Neuroscience, some

364
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.520
of the biggest achievements focused on the combination of

365
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:04.319
anatomy and dynamics or time around the same period

366
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.969
uh in history, you had some other pioneering work

367
00:20:06.979 --> 00:20:10.930
happening by a, a couple of um gentlemen mcculloch

368
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.030
and Pitts and what they said was let's try

369
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.270
and think about uh abstractly what's happening here. So

370
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.160
how do we um reconceive the anatomy in mathematical

371
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.939
terms, though not modeling the anatomy, not modeling the

372
00:20:27.949 --> 00:20:32.290
activity with mathematical tools, but thinking about what the

373
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.339
anatomy is doing as calculating as a kind of

374
00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:40.040
mathematical kind of phenomenon. So they developed um some

375
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:45.859
the earliest mathematical models of uh neural activity. So

376
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:49.750
the mcculloch Pitts model um and they treated uh

377
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.630
these models as simple on and off switches, right?

378
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.819
So the the neural network as we come to

379
00:20:56.829 --> 00:20:59.689
talk about them today, neural network models, right? It's

380
00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:02.979
a collection of these ones and zeros or that

381
00:21:02.989 --> 00:21:05.180
these systems that are weighted, right? And it's all

382
00:21:05.189 --> 00:21:08.819
mathematical. And so this mcculloch hits of the quick

383
00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:13.520
little aside that work was foundational to um the

384
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.930
popular kind of models that we see now known

385
00:21:15.939 --> 00:21:20.000
as like large language models. So chat GP T

386
00:21:20.199 --> 00:21:22.795
um all these different kinds of systems that are

387
00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:25.405
so popular and and and controversial in the news

388
00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:29.505
lately, these are all defendants of the mcculloch Pitts

389
00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:34.435
model which treated cognition and thinking as essentially kind

390
00:21:34.444 --> 00:21:38.064
of like a mathematical phenomenon. It's all about calculations.

391
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.280
So you have these two traditions that were being

392
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.650
practiced. And I think it's fair to say that

393
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.250
the Macao Pits tradition which focused on the mathematics

394
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.430
and the computations and the abstraction away from the

395
00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:53.209
anatomy. That's definitely the one that has become the

396
00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:56.949
most popular. Again. Look at the successes of neural

397
00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:59.229
network models like, you know, chat GP T and

398
00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:04.020
stuff like that for the purposes of the book.

399
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.329
Though I point out that um and this is

400
00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:08.770
related to another paper that I wrote called the

401
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.810
Dynamical Renaissance in Neuroscience is that while there has

402
00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:18.660
been a great popularity in the abstraction away from

403
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.020
neurons and into developing these neural networks, there's also

404
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.380
been a refocusing as well on the dynamics and

405
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.989
the timing of neural systems. And so what we're

406
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.849
seeing is more and more focus on uh nonlinear

407
00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:35.520
dynamics, things like that um as being essential to

408
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.329
nervous systems. And so it's not just about like

409
00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:42.859
what calculations they're producing, which don't really matter, like

410
00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:45.219
how fast they go or how slow they go.

411
00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:48.300
It's just a number of steps and you can

412
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.219
do the steps fast, you can do the steps

413
00:22:50.229 --> 00:22:52.849
slow, but you get the same output. But there's

414
00:22:52.859 --> 00:22:57.239
been a new appreciation for this earlier work which

415
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.280
I call the Hot and Huxley tradition that says

416
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.569
it's not just about the steps, but it's also

417
00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.770
about how fast they happen or how slow they

418
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.750
happen. And so this renaissance of as I call

419
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.569
it and I talk about in the book is

420
00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:12.589
that neuroscience is repaying attention to the dynamics of

421
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:17.069
what's happening in cognitive systems, intelligence systems and perception.

422
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.109
Um I forget if you had a, a another

423
00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:21.550
part of your question. Uh

424
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.589
No, no, but I, I actually want to ask

425
00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:26.849
you a follow up. So just to see if

426
00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:31.869
I understood it correctly, then these emphasis on abstract

427
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.770
features of neurons actually something that in more recent

428
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.880
times as lether or at least some people in

429
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.859
the cognitive sciences, neuroscience and so on to a

430
00:23:43.869 --> 00:23:50.920
more uh dynamical systems approach to uh cognition, psychology

431
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.229
and so on. Is that correct or?

432
00:23:53.959 --> 00:23:59.819
Well? So sometimes. So um if I understood the

433
00:23:59.829 --> 00:24:03.300
question correctly, are people who are focusing on the

434
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:08.760
abstract computations of uh neural systems of cognitive systems?

435
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:13.569
Are they now including dynamics? Um Sometimes they are

436
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:17.020
but not always necessarily and ST as vice versa,

437
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.510
people who focus on the dynamics are not focusing

438
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.589
on the computational properties per se. So there is

439
00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:27.000
some overlap but not necessarily. So. Um Yeah.

440
00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:30.199
Mhm No, I was just trying to really understand

441
00:24:30.209 --> 00:24:33.260
here and perhaps to some extent I was oversimplifying

442
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.739
it, but I was uh since you mentioned the

443
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:40.880
dynamical Renen in cognitive science and neuroscience, uh I

444
00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:45.699
was just wondering if really abstracting more from uh

445
00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:51.020
neurons for more from their biological features, not focusing

446
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.680
too much on them would help moving beyond these.

447
00:24:55.819 --> 00:25:00.760
I don't know, perhaps brain centered approach and uh

448
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:07.829
computational representational approach to uh cognition, neuroscience and so

449
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:08.140
on.

450
00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:13.140
Well, it's interesting, I think um there's people who

451
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.310
have used the same evidence to make different conclusions.

452
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.969
So some people have argued that um you know,

453
00:25:20.979 --> 00:25:25.459
because nervous systems and take, you know, humans and

454
00:25:25.469 --> 00:25:29.660
other mammals um because what really matters to intelligence

455
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.989
and perception and memory and all this stuff is

456
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.569
the computations in the nervous system. It doesn't really

457
00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:39.339
matter. Um If it's in a mammal, it, it

458
00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:41.530
could be, you know, in a bird, it could

459
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.170
be an insect, it could be in a computer,

460
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.199
it could be, you know, I don't know, in

461
00:25:46.209 --> 00:25:48.910
a ghost made out of ectoplasm or something like

462
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.250
that. I don't know. Whereas other people have said

463
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.430
no, no, no, no, no. What the nervous system

464
00:25:53.439 --> 00:25:56.199
is doing is a spec you know, special kind

465
00:25:56.209 --> 00:26:00.530
of computation that's, you know, specific to, you know,

466
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.520
brains and there's something very special about brains. Now

467
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.209
where the dynamics come in that just adds another

468
00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:09.890
layer, right? Some people say, what's the computations and

469
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.800
the dynamics that prove this, what's the computations and

470
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.640
dynamics that prove that it's been really tough to,

471
00:26:15.849 --> 00:26:18.369
to say uh who's right and who's wrong in

472
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.250
those debates? Mhm

473
00:26:20.449 --> 00:26:23.459
Yeah. A actually, yeah. Now, now that you're mentioning

474
00:26:23.469 --> 00:26:27.599
that uh you're right. So sometimes when there's discussion

475
00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:31.989
surrounding uh uh the extent to which uh artificial

476
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.709
intelligence, artificial intelligence systems can be or become humanlike,

477
00:26:37.719 --> 00:26:41.739
there's that idea that perhaps if it's uh just

478
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.005
about computations, I mean, the same computations can be

479
00:26:46.015 --> 00:26:52.165
instantiated in silicon based uh cognitive systems as they

480
00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:56.224
are in carbon based cognitive systems. Right. Mhm. I

481
00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:56.785
guess.

482
00:26:56.795 --> 00:26:58.685
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. That's right.

483
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.869
So, but then, uh, we were talking about uh

484
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.209
ecological psychology as well and the relationship or the

485
00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:13.119
lack thereof with ecological psychology and neuroscience. But then

486
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.869
there's also ecological neuroscience. So what is it? And

487
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.469
what's basically the theoretical background behind it?

488
00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:29.430
Yeah. So ecological neuroscience um is a term um

489
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:33.150
used loosely, there's no official kind of discipline called

490
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.689
ecological neuroscience. Ecological Neuroscience term used to refer to

491
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:41.660
people who are attempting to try and bring together

492
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.859
uh these seemingly disparate and irreconcilable approaches to understanding

493
00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:48.530
cognition and perception. So what they wanna do, they

494
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.130
wanna see if the lessons from Gibson and ecological

495
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.689
psychology can be uh integrated with uh what we

496
00:27:56.699 --> 00:27:59.949
know about the nervous system. And so you've got

497
00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:02.160
work um going back at least to the 19

498
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.369
eighties in which people are paying more attention uh

499
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.400
by people. I mean, ecological psychologists are paying more

500
00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.689
attention to the contributions of the nervous system and

501
00:28:11.699 --> 00:28:17.500
brain to things like afford its perception. Now, iii

502
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.189
I really need to stress um a couple of

503
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:26.810
things here. So one is that Gibson um James

504
00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:30.420
Gibson and his spouse Eleanor Gibson, they were really

505
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.599
pushing back against the dominant approach, the dominant approach

506
00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:35.439
that you just, you gotta look at the brain,

507
00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:39.229
the brain is awesome and computers are awesome. And

508
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.880
we've got all this technology, we have put all

509
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.020
this stuff together and that's where, you know, we're

510
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.979
really gonna be explaining things and I think at

511
00:28:45.989 --> 00:28:50.040
least strategically, um you know, the Gibsons especially, you

512
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.390
know, James Gibson and his work on perception was

513
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.449
like, we're not even gonna really talk about the

514
00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:58.300
brain, right? We're not gonna really talk about that.

515
00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.270
Like, of course, you know, mammals, the chimpanzee has

516
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.140
a brain, of course, it has a nervous system,

517
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.319
of course, it controls movement with its nervous system

518
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:10.000
and, and, and, and brain. But really what matters

519
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.510
is that we need to really appreciate the role

520
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.040
of the body and the role of the environment.

521
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:21.530
And so, um by not talking about the brain

522
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.540
and not emphasizing the nervous system, this led a

523
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.589
uh uh a lot of people to think that

524
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:34.209
uh ecological psychologists uh didn't believe in brains that

525
00:29:34.219 --> 00:29:37.619
they ignored brains that they thought maybe that they

526
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:42.369
just didn't exist. Uh So, for example, um Daniel

527
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.430
Dennett, the philosopher, cognitive scientist, uh he's get some

528
00:29:46.439 --> 00:29:49.079
quotes from some writings he did in the eighties

529
00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:52.890
uh where he said, you know, people like Gibson,

530
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.989
they treat the brain as if it's a piece

531
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.959
of wonder tissue it's, it's like it's magical. We

532
00:29:58.969 --> 00:30:01.310
don't even need to explain really how it works

533
00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:02.849
or that there's neurons. It doesn't, it's just, it's

534
00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:05.739
magical. It's a magical part of the body and

535
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.010
it resonates magically with for ins and things like

536
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.430
that. Other people like Carl Pribram also in the

537
00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:15.900
19 eighties. Uh He has this other uh great

538
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.880
quote and I say great cause it's, you know,

539
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.310
it's something special. He says, uh you know, there

540
00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.510
are some ecological psychologists that acknowledge that there's a

541
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.859
brain and nervous system. But for people like James

542
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:31.000
Gibson, uh whether you know, there's really that stuff

543
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.890
on the inside or just foam rubber, it makes

544
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.560
no difference to their theory, right? And so you've

545
00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:42.489
got Dennett who thinks uh the Gibsons ecological psychologists

546
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.859
are wowed by the magic of the brain. So

547
00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:47.689
they don't even want to touch it or talk

548
00:30:47.699 --> 00:30:49.410
about it. And you've got people like prem and

549
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.395
other people who are like they, I just think

550
00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:52.994
that it doesn't even matter. You could, you could

551
00:30:53.005 --> 00:30:55.484
fill, you know, you could just, you know, scoop

552
00:30:55.494 --> 00:30:57.415
out all my brain and fill it with rubber

553
00:30:57.425 --> 00:30:59.165
and it wouldn't make any difference to my ability

554
00:30:59.175 --> 00:31:02.704
to perceive for since, right. So Gibson, an ecological

555
00:31:02.714 --> 00:31:06.055
psychologist had a really hard time uh with trying

556
00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:10.074
to explain things like perception without doing what everyone

557
00:31:10.084 --> 00:31:12.824
else was doing, which was talking about the brain

558
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:18.079
and talking about complications. So, um I think that's

559
00:31:18.089 --> 00:31:21.829
really important to, to, to acknowledge that. So, ecological

560
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:25.319
neuroscience was this attempt to say, hey, we have

561
00:31:25.329 --> 00:31:28.319
it as ecological psychologists really focused on the brain

562
00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:31.640
and specifically what the brain is doing. Um We

563
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.810
don't think that it doesn't matter if it's a

564
00:31:33.819 --> 00:31:36.319
brain or foam rubber, like no, no brains matter,

565
00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:39.989
right? Brains matter. They're important. Are they computing like

566
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.170
a computer? Are they representing the environment um in

567
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.640
little pictures in the head? And that's how we

568
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.599
control things like action and my ability to grab,

569
00:31:49.609 --> 00:31:51.569
you know, the avoidance of this cup. Is it

570
00:31:51.579 --> 00:31:55.910
really about computing and representing? No, it's not, but

571
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.750
the brain is doing something. Let's see what it's

572
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.939
doing. So, ecological psychologists were interested in trying to

573
00:32:01.949 --> 00:32:04.760
see what is the nervous system activity that is

574
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.959
going along with things like hance perception and that

575
00:32:07.969 --> 00:32:10.969
was some of the early kind of ecological neuroscience

576
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.869
work. Um I can leave it at that for

577
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.050
now. Yeah.

578
00:32:15.939 --> 00:32:19.459
Sure. So uh I, I think that we've already

579
00:32:19.469 --> 00:32:24.650
covered uh lots of theoretical and historical background here.

580
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.739
Uh I want to get into the main thesis

581
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.689
that you develop in your book. I guess that

582
00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:31.829
before that we just need to talk a little

583
00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:36.170
bit about complexity science here. We've already talked about

584
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.469
ecological psychology and neuroscience, how they relate how they

585
00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:45.439
split historically and then also ecology, neuroscience and traditions

586
00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:49.609
in neuroscience. So perhaps uh that's enough about it

587
00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:52.329
if you have something else to add about it,

588
00:32:52.339 --> 00:32:57.660
please go ahead. But uh getting into complexity science,

589
00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.329
I mean, we've already again, talked a lot about

590
00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:02.930
it in our first interview. So I refer to

591
00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:06.310
it again. But what role does it play in

592
00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:09.819
the context of the thesis you develop in your

593
00:33:09.829 --> 00:33:10.969
book? Exactly.

594
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.079
Yeah. So um I think historically, part of the

595
00:33:19.089 --> 00:33:26.839
problem with bringing together ecological psychology and neuroscience is

596
00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:29.060
that they just have very different ways of talking

597
00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:33.119
about the world and they have different methods and

598
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.609
different tools that they use. So my thinking was

599
00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:42.290
what if we start bringing them together by applying

600
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.739
a similar kind of investigative approach. Uh AAA similar

601
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.640
set of concepts, a similar set of methods that

602
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.969
both ecological psychologists and neuroscientists can both agree on

603
00:33:55.979 --> 00:33:58.420
and use and maybe that can be a way

604
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.550
to bring them together. So to that end, um

605
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.800
I thought that complexity science offered those concepts and

606
00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.489
those tools that are applicable to the very little.

607
00:34:10.708 --> 00:34:13.849
So the neurons in the brain, to the very

608
00:34:13.858 --> 00:34:18.018
big, just an organism acting in the world. And

609
00:34:18.029 --> 00:34:22.069
so um this is not anything especially unique to

610
00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.759
me because the fact is that if you look

611
00:34:24.768 --> 00:34:27.998
at the ecological psychology literature and you look at

612
00:34:28.009 --> 00:34:30.958
the neuroscience literature, there are people who have been

613
00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:35.688
trying to pull little bits from complexity science because

614
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.610
it's such a broadly applicable set of tools. So

615
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.120
complexity science is um made up of a lot

616
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:46.870
of sub disciplines. But in short, it tends to

617
00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:51.000
include things like systems theory. Um So the idea

618
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.239
from like cybernetics and things like that of the

619
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.120
importance of feedback loops in systems. Uh It takes

620
00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:00.610
a lot from nonlinear dynamical systems theory. So these

621
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.050
tools that have been developed to capture very complicated

622
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:09.520
um types of temporal uh behaviors and systems, right?

623
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.725
And so all these different kinds of of tools

624
00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:14.705
have come together into complexity science to allow you

625
00:35:14.715 --> 00:35:17.135
to say I'm gonna study what the neuron is

626
00:35:17.145 --> 00:35:21.375
doing while an organism is perceiving and afford it.

627
00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.314
And I can talk about the neuron and the

628
00:35:23.324 --> 00:35:25.945
body and the environment in very similar ways. I

629
00:35:25.955 --> 00:35:28.544
can use very similar tools. And that's the what

630
00:35:28.554 --> 00:35:31.604
the role of complexity science plays um in my

631
00:35:31.614 --> 00:35:32.225
approach.

632
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.739
And so tell us then about what you call

633
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.479
in the book, the next framework that is the

634
00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:45.889
neuro ecological nexus theory framework. So what is it

635
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:47.290
about? Exactly?

636
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.610
Yeah. So the uh neuro ecological nexus theory is,

637
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.300
you know, my attempt at synthesizing really the best

638
00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.020
of ecological psychology, the best of neuroscience and the

639
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.810
tools and concepts from complexity science into a way

640
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.814
in which we can understand the contributions, the nervous

641
00:36:07.824 --> 00:36:10.725
system to the body, to the environment and back

642
00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:15.294
all under one framework. So the uh the neuro

643
00:36:15.304 --> 00:36:19.534
part refers to the importance um of the nervous

644
00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:22.675
system in the brain. The ecological part refers to

645
00:36:22.685 --> 00:36:27.399
the importance of environmental or ecological information. The nexus

646
00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:30.129
part refers to the idea that we have to

647
00:36:30.139 --> 00:36:34.040
find some way to systematically connect, right, there's kind

648
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.610
of a flow from brains into bodies into the

649
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.010
environment. And back, we have to understand our task

650
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.169
of understanding intelligent behavior and mind is to understand

651
00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:47.129
that nexus that flow between those different uh spatial

652
00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:50.469
and temporal scales. And coming up with a system

653
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.189
that makes sense um that is, is, you know,

654
00:36:53.199 --> 00:36:56.229
have scientific virtues like simplicity and prediction and things

655
00:36:56.239 --> 00:37:00.770
like that. And so um this is a, a

656
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.889
theory um or philosophy if you will about minds,

657
00:37:05.899 --> 00:37:08.800
but it's also supposed to be a scientific research

658
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.989
program. And so, while it has these strong theoretical

659
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.060
and philosophical approaches, you know, stuff from ecological psychology,

660
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.270
complexity theory and things like that, it also offers

661
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:26.929
testable hypotheses. And so the theory um uh is,

662
00:37:26.979 --> 00:37:28.540
do you want me to get into, can I

663
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:32.050
explain uh briefly the the different hypotheses? Y yes,

664
00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.159
of course. Yes. OK, great. So um as a

665
00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:39.399
testable kind of science of mind, science of intelligent

666
00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:43.439
behavior, um next offers stick hypotheses which I'll go

667
00:37:43.449 --> 00:37:48.639
over briefly. And so the first hypothesis um is

668
00:37:48.649 --> 00:37:52.689
that the organism environment system is the privileged spatial

669
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.889
temporal scale of description to understand mind. So we

670
00:37:56.899 --> 00:38:00.110
wanna understand what mind is. And I use mine

671
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.699
loosely like refer to intelligent behavior which could include

672
00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:06.699
things like perception and action, but also you know,

673
00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:10.199
memory and problem solving if we wanna understand that

674
00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:12.800
really, we have to pay attention to the real

675
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.840
time interactions going on in the body and the

676
00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:20.020
environment. So the environment will always be constraining the

677
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.840
body, the body will always be kind of constraining

678
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:28.179
the environment. So that's the first hypothesis. The second

679
00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:31.989
hypothesis is that when it comes to the contributions

680
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.080
of the nervous system, the most significant contributions come

681
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.820
from the neuralation dynamic. But when it comes to

682
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:47.060
understanding coordinative behavior or problem solving really the action,

683
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.659
so to say is coming from neuro populations. So

684
00:38:49.669 --> 00:38:52.790
it's not in single neurons, it's not in broad

685
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.780
regions of the brain, but it's in the connection

686
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.729
of populations of neurons. And so that's the significant

687
00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:05.060
target of population. The third hypothesis is that those

688
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:10.639
neuro dynamics, uh what is really significant about them

689
00:39:10.649 --> 00:39:14.320
is their low dimensional activity. But there's always gonna

690
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.500
be a lot of activity going on, we'll call

691
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.889
that high dimensional activity. But when we sift through

692
00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:25.310
that high dimensional activity, we will zero in on

693
00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:29.159
actually a much more sim simple structure of dynamics

694
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.919
that are driving the behavior. So the third hypothesis

695
00:39:32.929 --> 00:39:37.280
is to discover to reveal those low dimensional dynamics

696
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:43.239
in the nervous system. The fourth hypothesis is that

697
00:39:43.669 --> 00:39:46.810
uh just like the brain of the nervous system

698
00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:52.489
um is most significantly about the low dimensional dynamics.

699
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.290
So too is the body. So the body, uh

700
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.550
this is again, hypothesis for the body is organized

701
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:05.139
into low-dimensional synergy and so synergies are particular organizations

702
00:40:05.149 --> 00:40:09.320
of the body for purposes of intelligent behavior, for

703
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.860
purposes of, you know, swinging a bat and hitting

704
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.840
a ball or dribbling a football, right? The body

705
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.500
organizes into certain synergies in order to perform those

706
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.959
actions. And those synergies are essentially those low dimensional

707
00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:28.790
um kinds of coordinative aspects of the body. The

708
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:35.209
fifth hypothesis is that mind again used very broadly,

709
00:40:35.689 --> 00:40:40.159
is it fundamentally emerges at low dimensional scale of

710
00:40:40.169 --> 00:40:44.840
these organism environment activities. So, although there's a lot

711
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:48.229
of uh neural activity happening all over the place,

712
00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:51.320
although the body is constantly moving, although there's a

713
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:55.340
lot going on in the environment, really intelligent behavior,

714
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.209
mind perception problem. So all these things happen when

715
00:40:59.219 --> 00:41:04.229
all of that collapses into low-dimensional uh structures. And

716
00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:07.239
there's a coordinations between the low-dimensional structures of the

717
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.060
brain, the low dimensional structure of the body and

718
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.139
the low dimensional structure of the environment. And that's

719
00:41:13.149 --> 00:41:18.530
how we are best poised to understand the brain

720
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.590
body and environment contribution to those activities. And so

721
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.590
the final uh hypothesis is that the neuro ecological

722
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:32.840
nexus theory explains those low dimensional structures in terms

723
00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:37.310
of a finite set of organizational principles. So there's

724
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.320
not gonna be an infinite set of um rules

725
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.139
that guide the organization of my body, but there

726
00:41:44.149 --> 00:41:46.280
will be a finite set of rules that guide

727
00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.100
the organization of my body, for example. So things

728
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:54.399
like um critical states, criticality is one kind of

729
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.820
rule or principle that guides a lot of different

730
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.520
kinds of organization in the brain body and environment,

731
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.979
essentially to kind of flesh it out a little

732
00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:06.794
bit. A critical state is when you have uh

733
00:42:06.804 --> 00:42:10.254
a lot of high dimensional activity that gets to

734
00:42:10.264 --> 00:42:15.915
a point where uh it is balanced between disorder

735
00:42:15.925 --> 00:42:19.415
and order. So it's organized enough to maintain a

736
00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:23.175
structure, but it's loose enough that it can adapt.

737
00:42:23.475 --> 00:42:25.495
And so we call that that comes from physics.

738
00:42:25.504 --> 00:42:28.094
And this is another key term in complexity science,

739
00:42:28.155 --> 00:42:31.334
a critical state. And so I think it's likely

740
00:42:31.344 --> 00:42:35.229
that neural activity, the body and the environment, they

741
00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:39.199
reach these critical states in order to achieve uh

742
00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:44.030
mind behavior activity and things like that. And so

743
00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.229
as hypotheses, I think these are all empirically testable,

744
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.830
I think they all have to be theoretically reasonable.

745
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.370
Um But they can also all be wrong. Uh

746
00:42:54.379 --> 00:42:56.270
If they were, if it wasn't possible for them

747
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.729
to be wrong, it wouldn't be a science, it

748
00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:00.520
would just be a dogma and that's, that's not

749
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.830
fun. Mhm

750
00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:04.840
Yeah, that, that's all great. And by the way,

751
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.760
I have a question saved for later on in

752
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:12.110
our conversation about the main challenges to your proposal

753
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.179
here. And we can come back to that. But

754
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.800
I wanted to ask you at this point specifically

755
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.929
when it comes to those hypothesis that you mentioned

756
00:43:20.939 --> 00:43:24.919
there and looking at the evidence across the different

757
00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:29.699
cognitive disciplines and so on at this point in

758
00:43:29.709 --> 00:43:32.189
time, at least, and I hope this is not

759
00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:34.879
uh too unfair of a question to ask at

760
00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:38.229
this point because you're just suggesting this theory in

761
00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:42.060
your book. But at this point in time, uh

762
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.050
how much do you think uh uh how much

763
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:50.310
support do you think they have scientifically, not only

764
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:55.439
empirically but also uh how the uh how accepted

765
00:43:55.449 --> 00:44:00.659
they would be theoretically taking into account our current

766
00:44:00.669 --> 00:44:04.754
state of the art in the cognitive sciences and

767
00:44:04.935 --> 00:44:09.165
how much work and what sources of evidence would

768
00:44:09.175 --> 00:44:13.695
we need to draw from? To uh really demonstrate

769
00:44:13.705 --> 00:44:17.344
that it's potentially uh true or correct?

770
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:24.110
Yeah. So um it is a fair question and

771
00:44:24.479 --> 00:44:31.750
I think in one way, um I think things

772
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.250
are going in my favor and they're going in

773
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.399
my favor because uh I can interpret a lot

774
00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:41.500
of research that has been done in ecological psychology

775
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:45.590
in neuroscience through the lens of a neuro ecological

776
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.270
nexus theory. So I can point out at research

777
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.870
on network neuroscience that looks at critical states, I

778
00:44:51.879 --> 00:44:55.510
can look at affordances perception that's been modeled uh

779
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.889
as synergies connected to, you know, self-organization and things

780
00:44:59.899 --> 00:45:01.699
like that, right. So I can, I can pull

781
00:45:01.709 --> 00:45:04.040
out these examples, right? And I can say, oh,

782
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.540
so this is support for hypothesis one, this is

783
00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:11.030
support for this. The hard part though is um

784
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.909
supporting the theory as a whole, right? So the

785
00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:20.669
tough part is gonna be running maybe an experiment

786
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.379
that's gonna hit on all those different levels, all

787
00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:26.739
those different scales and that's gonna be really hard.

788
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:31.360
So, how would I uh test the neuro ecological

789
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:34.360
nexus theory? Uh AS a whole? Well, I would,

790
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.389
I would have to have a subject come in.

791
00:45:36.399 --> 00:45:38.149
I would have to record from their brain. I

792
00:45:38.159 --> 00:45:39.689
would have to record from their body. I would

793
00:45:39.699 --> 00:45:42.870
have to record the environmental information. Oh, this is

794
00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:45.830
just gonna be a huge amount of data, right?

795
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.455
It's gonna be enormous. I mean, look at, look

796
00:45:48.465 --> 00:45:50.945
at the brain, all this, you know, brain research

797
00:45:50.955 --> 00:45:53.504
that's been happening the last 10 years. Uh THE

798
00:45:53.514 --> 00:45:57.715
brain initiative, the human brain project, they received billions

799
00:45:57.725 --> 00:46:01.064
of dollars uh on the promise that in 10

800
00:46:01.074 --> 00:46:05.399
years they would simulate a whole brain. Well, it

801
00:46:05.409 --> 00:46:09.120
didn't happen, right? It didn't happen because they started

802
00:46:09.129 --> 00:46:12.120
finding things like, well, there's actually not just a

803
00:46:12.129 --> 00:46:14.459
few kinds of neurons in the brain or a

804
00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:16.939
few kinds of cells. It's actually probably a couple

805
00:46:16.949 --> 00:46:19.340
of 1000 different kinds of cells just in the

806
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:23.620
brain alone. So we might be kind of worse

807
00:46:23.629 --> 00:46:25.270
off than we thought we were. It might be

808
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.879
much more complex than we thought it was. So

809
00:46:27.889 --> 00:46:29.620
what we ended up seeing was a lot of

810
00:46:29.629 --> 00:46:33.560
these approaches, they change their goal from, we're gonna

811
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:37.320
simulate a whole brain to we're gonna develop ways

812
00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:39.760
to record data and share it with each other.

813
00:46:39.979 --> 00:46:42.080
So that's just the first step, right? So a

814
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.080
way to, to handle all this data and, and,

815
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.909
and making sense of it is gonna be a

816
00:46:46.919 --> 00:46:50.479
very big challenging part and that's just the brain

817
00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:53.209
alone and I wanna come along and say I

818
00:46:53.219 --> 00:46:56.360
wanna do that and the body and the environment,

819
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.899
right? It can be really hard to do, at

820
00:46:58.909 --> 00:47:04.090
least in one kind of um straightforward, simple setup

821
00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.780
that's gonna hit on all of those hypotheses. What

822
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.739
I'm gonna end up having to do is do

823
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.360
each one individually and then build up a case

824
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:16.040
and hopefully motivate that case. But again, each of

825
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.280
the hypotheses are hypotheses and they can be proven

826
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.600
wrong and it would require revising or undermining the

827
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.469
whole project. Um But I think there's a reasonable

828
00:47:26.479 --> 00:47:28.760
shot that the hypotheses will turn out to be

829
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.580
supported because there is other work as I point

830
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.399
out in the book that supports each of the

831
00:47:34.409 --> 00:47:39.129
hypotheses on their own. Does that address the, the

832
00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:39.800
question? Uh Y

833
00:47:39.969 --> 00:47:43.000
yes, but, but then uh a follow up to

834
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.820
that since you mentioned the human brain project and

835
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.459
all of that, uh when it comes to having

836
00:47:49.469 --> 00:47:54.300
a better understanding or ideally a complete understanding of

837
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.179
how our human cognition works, our, how, how our

838
00:47:58.189 --> 00:48:01.909
psychology works. And of course, the human brain project

839
00:48:01.919 --> 00:48:05.379
is or is or was not just simply about

840
00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:09.032
cognition or anything like that, it was about the

841
00:48:09.042 --> 00:48:12.272
entirety of the human brain. And so I'm not

842
00:48:12.282 --> 00:48:17.512
sure what kinds of claims exactly people were making

843
00:48:17.522 --> 00:48:20.762
about how much of our psychology we could understand

844
00:48:20.772 --> 00:48:25.252
through it. But let's say that your theory is

845
00:48:25.262 --> 00:48:29.433
correct in comparison to something like the human brain

846
00:48:29.535 --> 00:48:32.906
project. If people were to apply it, to have

847
00:48:32.916 --> 00:48:38.176
a full understanding of our cognition, how much better

848
00:48:38.186 --> 00:48:41.196
of a prospect do you think your theory would

849
00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:45.585
be in comparison to just having a complete mapping

850
00:48:45.595 --> 00:48:48.535
of the human brain when it comes to understanding

851
00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:50.716
how cognition works?

852
00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:57.870
Yeah. So um I think uh here's my uh

853
00:48:57.879 --> 00:49:01.669
as, as they say, my hot take, um we

854
00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:05.300
will not be able to explain most things. We

855
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:09.260
find interesting about cognition in mind by just looking

856
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.300
at what the brain is doing. The brain is

857
00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:15.120
in some ways. It, it's the most, you know,

858
00:49:15.129 --> 00:49:17.179
people describe it, you know, in a cliche, it's

859
00:49:17.189 --> 00:49:19.340
the most complicated thing in the universe that we

860
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.879
know about. Um But in, in other ways, it's

861
00:49:22.889 --> 00:49:26.459
not that interesting. It's just made up of cells

862
00:49:26.469 --> 00:49:29.050
that are the same as the cells, you know,

863
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.179
in my stomach or on my arm or that

864
00:49:31.189 --> 00:49:34.290
used to be in my hair. Um It, you

865
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.959
know, it's just the same kind of structure of

866
00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:39.879
those cells they communicate um in interesting ways. Uh

867
00:49:39.889 --> 00:49:42.489
THE communication, we see that kind of level of

868
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:47.270
communication and things like like beehives and ant colonies

869
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.969
uh in cities and the internet and stuff like

870
00:49:49.979 --> 00:49:53.409
that. So, there's nothing really Irle about it. That's

871
00:49:53.419 --> 00:49:59.729
particularly interesting. Um One of my um colleagues, uh

872
00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:05.139
Maor Mangala, he's a neuroscientist uh uh who's highly

873
00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:08.370
influenced by ecological psychology. And, and he often refers

874
00:50:08.379 --> 00:50:12.320
to one of his colleagues, Damien Kelty Steven, who

875
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.870
describes the brain as a milkshake. And he says

876
00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:19.409
that uh the brain is more like a milkshake

877
00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:22.649
than it is like a computer. Uh MILKSHAKES are

878
00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:26.080
made up of fats and proteins and sugars. Brains

879
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.879
are made up of fats and proteins and sugars.

880
00:50:28.889 --> 00:50:31.780
Uh COMPUTERS are nothing like that, right? And the

881
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.479
swishing and swirling of, you know, the activity in

882
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.620
the blood and the oxygen and all that stuff,

883
00:50:36.629 --> 00:50:39.780
it's more like a milkshake, right? And so my

884
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:43.780
hot take is when it comes to understanding um

885
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.949
you know, intelligence and memory and creativity and coordinations.

886
00:50:48.229 --> 00:50:52.270
Um IT'S gonna have to include an understanding of

887
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.199
the body, it's gonna have to include an understanding

888
00:50:55.399 --> 00:50:58.850
of body's en environment. Um And I think that's

889
00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.669
something that um you know, Gibson was really focused

890
00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:07.979
on. He wasn't necessarily like anti neuroscience, right? But

891
00:51:07.989 --> 00:51:11.540
he was anti uh privileging the brain that the

892
00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.179
brain is just, it's like, you know, kind of

893
00:51:13.189 --> 00:51:16.770
like magic. Oh we worship the brain, right? And,

894
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.290
and, and it's like we've got the little, you

895
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.080
know, your little soul or your little homunculus sitting,

896
00:51:21.129 --> 00:51:23.489
you know, controlling everything and it's like, no, no,

897
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.689
no, that's not happening, right? The brain is just

898
00:51:25.699 --> 00:51:28.600
an organ in the body that plays a role

899
00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:30.979
as the heart plays a role. Um YOU know,

900
00:51:30.989 --> 00:51:33.939
different things like that. Um I was very privileged

901
00:51:33.949 --> 00:51:39.010
to have um the eminent neuroscientist, uh Gary Bussi,

902
00:51:39.149 --> 00:51:42.739
um who's one of my heroes in neuroscience. He's

903
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:46.669
um really emphasized, you know, dynamics and time and,

904
00:51:46.679 --> 00:51:48.939
and that feature of the brain. But he endorsed

905
00:51:48.949 --> 00:51:50.610
my book and, you know, one thing he said

906
00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.760
was, um we really need to understand the fact

907
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.149
that the brain is just an organ, it's just

908
00:51:56.159 --> 00:51:59.320
an organ in the skull. Um And it, you

909
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:01.969
know, you have to understand how it's situated in

910
00:52:01.979 --> 00:52:03.860
the body. And there's a, a, you know, a,

911
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.090
a mutual kind of pathway between what the body

912
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.040
does and the, you know, the brain does and

913
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.209
it's not just about a top down kind of

914
00:52:10.219 --> 00:52:15.439
control. And so I think it's not my approach,

915
00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:18.590
you know, the neuro ecological nexus theory, I think

916
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.350
something along those lines is gonna have to be

917
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.239
true uh to explain even the most simple of

918
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.000
cognitive or mental phenomenon. Um And one last little

919
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.280
bit on, on my tirade, um a response to

920
00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:36.659
your question is we already kind of know that

921
00:52:36.669 --> 00:52:41.969
that project is gonna fail, not just um practically,

922
00:52:41.979 --> 00:52:45.560
right? So it's not like, OK, uh give us

923
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:49.439
$10 billion over 10 years, we'll simulate a brain.

924
00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:53.030
OK? That didn't happen. Uh So it failed. No,

925
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.520
no, even if it worked, I don't think it

926
00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.199
would have provided the kind of uh explanations or

927
00:53:00.209 --> 00:53:04.429
understanding we want because we've already done it with

928
00:53:04.439 --> 00:53:08.320
simpler organism. So we've basically already done the human

929
00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:12.459
brain project with uh little little tiny organism of

930
00:53:12.469 --> 00:53:15.669
the ce again worm, which only has about, I

931
00:53:15.679 --> 00:53:19.919
think it's like 307 neurons. And I mean, compare

932
00:53:19.929 --> 00:53:22.820
that to humans that have about, you know, I

933
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.810
don't know what it is. 80 billion,

934
00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.520
80 86 billion, I think,

935
00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:32.639
yeah, 86 billion. That's just the neurons, right? So

936
00:53:32.739 --> 00:53:36.000
uh not mentioning the connections and the supporting cells

937
00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:38.800
like glia and stuff like that astrocytes, but we

938
00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:43.510
already know the full mapping and all the connections

939
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.510
of a seal again and yet we can't predict

940
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.149
its movements. We still don't have an ex full

941
00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:53.360
explanation about how it moves and coordinates its body.

942
00:53:53.419 --> 00:53:57.409
That's only 300 neurons. All right. And we can't

943
00:53:57.419 --> 00:54:00.820
do it with that. My thought is we can't

944
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:02.790
do it with that because it's not just about

945
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.790
the neurons, right? A full explanation of ac elegance,

946
00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.270
intelligent behavior is gonna require yes, the neurons, but

947
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.689
also the body and the features of the environment

948
00:54:13.989 --> 00:54:15.860
and that's gonna be just as important.

949
00:54:17.459 --> 00:54:20.840
Well, uh I I guess that things are not

950
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:25.139
looking good for people who have brain centered approaches,

951
00:54:25.149 --> 00:54:30.340
but also not for uh those sort of transhumanists

952
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:35.320
who would want to upload their brains to machines.

953
00:54:36.179 --> 00:54:38.199
Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that if

954
00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:40.399
you want. But I mean, my take is that

955
00:54:40.409 --> 00:54:44.229
that's not a real possibility. Um THE uploading of,

956
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:47.629
of the mind um if there is any uploading,

957
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:51.719
it won't be completely you. Um IT may be

958
00:54:51.729 --> 00:54:53.060
a feature of you but, but that's a whole

959
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.340
other interview. I'll have to come back in a

960
00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:56.449
few months and then we can talk about transhumanism.

961
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.129
Yeah, I it was just me because II I

962
00:55:00.139 --> 00:55:02.280
have this sort of beef with some

963
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:02.979
friends. You

964
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.379
don't take it too seriously. So, uh OK, so

965
00:55:08.389 --> 00:55:10.830
uh let me just think here. So we were

966
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.760
talking about the ne next uh theory that you

967
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:20.250
presented there and you also explained how it integrates

968
00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:26.100
ecological psychology, neuroscience and so on. So what is

969
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.000
the ecological brain then? Really?

970
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:33.969
Yeah. Um And it's like, as I was writing

971
00:55:33.979 --> 00:55:36.370
the book, I realized I was like already finishing

972
00:55:36.379 --> 00:55:38.300
the book and I said, I don't think I've

973
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:41.530
explained what I even mean by the title and

974
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.129
I think that happens too often. People have really

975
00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:46.090
cool title and then they, they don't explain it.

976
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.870
I'm not saying mine's a cool title, but I

977
00:55:47.879 --> 00:55:50.889
didn't explain it. Um So in the end, um

978
00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:52.929
you know, II I mentioned it um in the

979
00:55:52.939 --> 00:55:56.919
concluding chapter, what is the ecological brain? Well, the

980
00:55:56.929 --> 00:56:00.340
ecological brain in short is the idea that a

981
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:04.870
brain is always a part of an ecology, right?

982
00:56:04.879 --> 00:56:08.709
It's not this system, it's not this machine that

983
00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:11.689
you can understand it in isolation. It's not like

984
00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:14.280
I can explain, you know, I have my, you

985
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.870
know, my phone, it's not like I have my

986
00:56:15.879 --> 00:56:19.189
phone and whether I'm sitting here in a nice

987
00:56:19.199 --> 00:56:22.870
temperature controlled room or I sit outside and it's

988
00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:26.169
warm or I go into a, um, a freezer

989
00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:28.800
that's storing meat and, and other kinds of foods,

990
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.199
but it's still operating the same way. Right. The

991
00:56:31.209 --> 00:56:33.989
ecology doesn't matter really to my iphone to a

992
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.520
certain degree, right? It gets too hot that it

993
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.239
stops working. But, but the brain is always a

994
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:42.750
part of ecology, the temperature of the body gravity,

995
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.540
all these things are acting on the brain and

996
00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:52.070
the brain is also contributing to directing what ecology

997
00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.899
the body will be in. So if I am

998
00:56:54.909 --> 00:56:58.699
feeling really cold, right? And, and I'm sending information,

999
00:56:58.709 --> 00:57:00.600
you know, across my body into my brain and

1000
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.750
then my brain is now, you know, getting oh

1001
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.919
that I'm not feeling too good. You know, my

1002
00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:06.570
brain might send out signals that says we need

1003
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.050
to change the ecology, right? We need to be

1004
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.810
in a different environment and those different environments are

1005
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.780
gonna affect what it does, right? And I think

1006
00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:16.110
this is kind of the, you know, the point

1007
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.540
that uh Bussi was saying when he, you know,

1008
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.850
you know, endorsed, you know, my book is that

1009
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.070
the brain is always a part of these ecologies.

1010
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.850
The brain is not this isolated kind of system.

1011
00:57:25.979 --> 00:57:28.290
And so to understand what the brain is doing,

1012
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.919
we have to understand that it is part of

1013
00:57:30.929 --> 00:57:34.610
that interactive kind of system and, and to that

1014
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.620
and not to beat up on the uh transhumanists

1015
00:57:36.629 --> 00:57:39.270
again. But um and to beat up on the

1016
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.939
human brain project, but that's what's kind of missing,

1017
00:57:41.949 --> 00:57:45.939
right? Is this lack of appreciation of what actually

1018
00:57:45.949 --> 00:57:50.060
should just be a really simple fact, right? Um

1019
00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.979
So in short, what is the ecological brain? The

1020
00:57:52.989 --> 00:57:57.120
ecological brain is the claim that like every other

1021
00:57:57.129 --> 00:58:00.469
aspect of organisms, the brain too is situated and

1022
00:58:00.479 --> 00:58:03.270
embedded in a certain kind of ecology and that's

1023
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.070
gonna affect its functioning and what it does. Mhm

1024
00:58:07.429 --> 00:58:09.419
By the way, I hope this is not a

1025
00:58:09.429 --> 00:58:14.209
silly question. But since we're talking about ecology here,

1026
00:58:14.469 --> 00:58:18.649
there's also an approach coming mostly from biology, but

1027
00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:23.050
also nowadays, many anthropologists apply it or use it

1028
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.820
as a framework. There is behavioral ecology and then

1029
00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:31.419
in the context of anthropology, human behavioral ecology that

1030
00:58:31.429 --> 00:58:35.929
is people look at different aspects, different factors that

1031
00:58:35.939 --> 00:58:40.959
differ across different ecologies and then try to understand

1032
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:45.790
uh in terms of our behavioral outputs our behavior.

1033
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:49.899
Uh IF there's regularities in terms of, if people

1034
00:58:49.909 --> 00:58:53.179
are exposed to this or that technological factors, uh

1035
00:58:53.199 --> 00:58:57.459
if there are some tendencies to uh develop societies

1036
00:58:57.469 --> 00:59:02.120
with certain characteristics or they themselves as individuals behaving

1037
00:59:02.129 --> 00:59:06.399
in certain ways, so does uh it connect or

1038
00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:10.350
has any relationship to that in any way because

1039
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.020
I was trying to understand if, um, that aspect

1040
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:19.439
of biology could also play a role here or

1041
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:19.739
not.

1042
00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:22.419
Yeah. Absolutely. I think it's definitely friendly at a

1043
00:59:22.429 --> 00:59:26.219
minimum. It's friendly to those kinds of approaches. Um,

1044
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.110
WHAT you're talking about as well. I think, um,

1045
00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:31.060
there might be some overlap with what I'm talking

1046
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.330
about, what you're talking about and then with something

1047
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:38.149
called developmental systems theory. And so developmental systems theory

1048
00:59:38.159 --> 00:59:40.889
is its approach to biology and psychology and it's

1049
00:59:40.899 --> 00:59:43.889
come to influence um even things like such as

1050
00:59:43.899 --> 00:59:47.739
understand the criminal justice system um and things like

1051
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.689
that. But the idea is always that it's these

1052
00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:55.350
whole systems that undergo change and adaptation. So it's

1053
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.370
uh I'm not what you're specifically referring to. I

1054
00:59:58.379 --> 01:00:00.479
don't wanna say what I'm about to say, applies

1055
01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:03.139
to that, but this applies to what I'm saying

1056
01:00:03.149 --> 01:00:06.919
and what the developmental systems theorists say they are

1057
01:00:07.449 --> 01:00:11.840
uh anti reductionist in the sense that um it's

1058
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:15.070
not just genes, for example, as maybe the most

1059
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.489
reductionist approach to biology, it's not just the gene

1060
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.449
that is uh driving um you know, um in

1061
01:00:23.459 --> 01:00:26.270
organisms, uh th the, and it's not just the

1062
01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.870
gene that is being acted on by selective pressures,

1063
01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:32.850
but actually, it's the gene part of the organism,

1064
01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.290
part of the environment, that whole system is what's

1065
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:41.770
being selected for. So, for example, um you know,

1066
01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.500
when beavers, um you know, they have a certain

1067
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.050
kind of body. They exist in certain kind of

1068
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:51.330
environments. They build certain kinds of dams, their teeth

1069
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.340
work on both kinds of trees and wood in

1070
01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:59.250
that area. If those beaver families survive, it's because

1071
01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.219
it's the whole system that survived. It's the, the

1072
01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:06.530
fur, the tail, the teeth, the wood, the water,

1073
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.729
all of that is a developing system over time.

1074
01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.570
And so it wouldn't make sense to just focus

1075
01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.540
on what is, what are the genes doing, right?

1076
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.909
Put those same genes, you know, in a different

1077
01:01:18.919 --> 01:01:22.270
body or put those beavers in a different environment

1078
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.179
and they might not be selected for or they

1079
01:01:25.189 --> 01:01:27.949
might be selected for. The point is, is that

1080
01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:30.649
it takes this whole entire kind of system to

1081
01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:34.239
be selected for. Is that what you're, does this

1082
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.320
fit with what this behavioral kind of and the

1083
01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.300
anthropological stuff you're talking about?

1084
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.209
Yes. And I guess that perhaps one of the

1085
01:01:42.219 --> 01:01:45.419
things you were alluding to there, I'm not sure

1086
01:01:45.429 --> 01:01:48.810
if directly or not when you mentioned the example

1087
01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:53.139
of the beaver disease, uh niche construction as well

1088
01:01:53.149 --> 01:01:53.500
or

1089
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:57.770
not. Yeah, absolutely. Um I think even people who

1090
01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.879
were the most, uh and I use, you know,

1091
01:01:59.889 --> 01:02:03.510
scare quotes again, the most reductionist about biology, I

1092
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.139
think even they, um, you know, you push them

1093
01:02:07.149 --> 01:02:09.840
enough and they'll say it can't possibly be just

1094
01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:12.739
the genes. So even so Richard Dawkins was one

1095
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.580
of the big proponents of the gene centric approach.

1096
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.500
He also had a book called The Extended Phenotype,

1097
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:21.169
right? And he talks about how, you know, these

1098
01:02:21.179 --> 01:02:23.530
behavioral things that happen in the world, the use

1099
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.629
of wood and the environment and stuff like that.

1100
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.040
He'd like to frame it in terms of extensions

1101
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.239
of the genes. I would just, I actually, I,

1102
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.820
you know, I'm reading the same thing that he's

1103
01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:34.889
saying and I come to different conclusions. It makes

1104
01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:37.419
me think that gene is less important. But, you

1105
01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:39.639
know, that's uh the biologist. Uh

1106
01:02:41.639 --> 01:02:46.389
Sure. So um I, I mentioned this question earlier,

1107
01:02:46.399 --> 01:02:48.939
but what would you say are perhaps some of

1108
01:02:48.949 --> 01:02:55.830
the main challenges to your ees to your next

1109
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.179
uh framework?

1110
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:03.580
Yeah. So there's uh there's challenges across the board,

1111
01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:08.409
right? So, um you know, conceptually, right, um when

1112
01:03:08.419 --> 01:03:11.189
I say mind, what do I mean by mind?

1113
01:03:11.199 --> 01:03:14.149
Um DO I also mean consciousness, do I just

1114
01:03:14.159 --> 01:03:18.030
mean problem solving? Do I mean perception action, right?

1115
01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.310
And these things are all debatable, right? So um

1116
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.149
some people argue that perception of action is not

1117
01:03:25.159 --> 01:03:29.610
mind, right? It's not cognition, it's something quite distinct,

1118
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.610
it's something that's more like me. You know, again,

1119
01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.080
I like using these quotes. It's more like mere

1120
01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:38.189
reflex, right? Whereas cognition is it allows you to

1121
01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:41.870
make decisions and intervene on mere reflexes. So, so

1122
01:03:41.879 --> 01:03:45.179
I've, I've already got challenges conceptually, right? Method of

1123
01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.810
logically, how do I put these things in practice?

1124
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.600
I talked about that a few minutes ago, right?

1125
01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:53.070
If the human brain project with billions of dollars

1126
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.469
in time and thousands of scientists couldn't come up

1127
01:03:56.479 --> 01:03:59.320
with a full simulation of just the brain. How

1128
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.699
am I gonna basically try and do uh an

1129
01:04:01.709 --> 01:04:06.139
afforded simulation from brain body and environment? That's methodologically,

1130
01:04:06.149 --> 01:04:10.040
that's gonna be very challenging and then theoretically right

1131
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:13.060
do and this overlaps with, you know, concepts as

1132
01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:17.919
well, but are affordances something that need to take

1133
01:04:17.929 --> 01:04:21.459
the nervous system into account? Um Am I missing

1134
01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:24.179
the, the whole point of what Gibson was saying?

1135
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.959
Uh THIS is, you know, kind of push back.

1136
01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:29.719
I've gotten from some ecological psychologist, right. Affordances only

1137
01:04:29.729 --> 01:04:32.909
exist in the environment and the organism and where

1138
01:04:32.919 --> 01:04:35.879
they meet and if you go too low into

1139
01:04:35.889 --> 01:04:37.409
the brain, then you're missing it. If you go

1140
01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:39.879
too high, then you're out of the system, right?

1141
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.429
That's a theoretical issue. So I, I think I

1142
01:04:44.439 --> 01:04:47.100
am open to being, you know, attacked and criticized

1143
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:51.040
in those three ways. But in particular, I think

1144
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:54.449
um I face criticisms both from people who I

1145
01:04:54.459 --> 01:04:58.379
think would be friendly um to ecological psychology. But

1146
01:04:58.389 --> 01:05:02.100
I also faced criticisms from people who are against

1147
01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:06.330
ecological psychology. So people who are friendly might be

1148
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:11.030
an activist. So an active cognition or an activism

1149
01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.629
is um a kind of popular approach to understanding

1150
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.020
what it is to be an intelligent living organism.

1151
01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:21.879
And sometimes there's some overlap with what ecological psychologists

1152
01:05:21.889 --> 01:05:25.459
say, but not always. And so there's that approach.

1153
01:05:25.469 --> 01:05:28.449
Why not do um why not call my book,

1154
01:05:28.459 --> 01:05:31.870
The Inactivate Brain, right? They might wanna say that

1155
01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:34.219
and that they'd say that's better than the ecological

1156
01:05:34.229 --> 01:05:37.330
brain. Maybe I'd have to argue with them about

1157
01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.659
that. Right? Then I also need to argue against

1158
01:05:40.669 --> 01:05:43.689
people who are against ecological psychology and people who

1159
01:05:43.699 --> 01:05:49.939
are proponents of computational representational approaches, proponents of mechanistic

1160
01:05:49.949 --> 01:05:54.879
approaches, proponents of reductionism, right? My book uh as

1161
01:05:54.889 --> 01:05:57.340
I say towards the end, uh I say something

1162
01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:59.979
along the lines of you might have noticed that

1163
01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:04.459
I didn't explain anything. I didn't describe anything about

1164
01:06:04.469 --> 01:06:10.250
my approach with computing, representing, I didn't describe any

1165
01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.729
mechanisms and I didn't reduce anything. And for some

1166
01:06:14.739 --> 01:06:17.060
people, if you miss, if you're missing out on

1167
01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.199
some of these and you're just not doing science,

1168
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.199
right? If you're not providing a mechanistic account, whatever

1169
01:06:23.209 --> 01:06:25.149
that is, we could talk about that also. But

1170
01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:26.969
if you're not giving a mechanistic account, then you're

1171
01:06:26.979 --> 01:06:30.820
not giving an explanation. So I'm pushing back, it's

1172
01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.340
just, it's a different way of doing science also

1173
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:35.800
that is pushing back against, you know, more reductionist

1174
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:40.139
approaches. Um PUSHING back against mechanistic approaches and then

1175
01:06:40.149 --> 01:06:43.399
pushing back against, you know, the apparent richness of

1176
01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:47.659
the computer metaphor and a representational approaches. So I,

1177
01:06:47.669 --> 01:06:49.959
I've got, I've got, I've got a line of

1178
01:06:49.969 --> 01:06:52.379
people, they, they, they're taking their number and they're,

1179
01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:54.379
they're ready to come in and get me.

1180
01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:59.360
So I have two questions. One about one specific

1181
01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:01.889
thing that you mentioned there and a follow up

1182
01:07:01.899 --> 01:07:08.669
to the challenges here. So you mentioned uh mechanistic

1183
01:07:08.679 --> 01:07:12.495
explanations there and you that many people would be

1184
01:07:12.504 --> 01:07:17.175
dismissive of your framework if it doesn't provide, provide

1185
01:07:17.185 --> 01:07:22.695
them with the mechanistic explanation for whatever aspect of

1186
01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.889
human cognition we're studying here. I guess. So um

1187
01:07:26.899 --> 01:07:31.969
I mean, what is a mechanistic explanation exactly, particularly

1188
01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:34.840
for the people who might not be familiar with

1189
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:39.050
this kind of terminology? And what would be, let's

1190
01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:43.169
say in this case, a non mechanistic explanation?

1191
01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:46.360
Yeah, good, good. So this is a very big

1192
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:51.010
issue and um the philosophy of science. Um And

1193
01:07:51.189 --> 01:07:53.469
uh I actually, I think it's a big issue

1194
01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:57.540
in science, the life science for practicing scientists, they

1195
01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:01.389
should think about this. Um So the mechanistic approach

1196
01:08:01.399 --> 01:08:06.250
um historically goes back to Newton and Descartes where

1197
01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:10.590
they um were thinking about say the solar system

1198
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.219
as a kind of machine, right? Uh PLANETS that

1199
01:08:14.229 --> 01:08:15.780
are kind of, you know, moving around in a

1200
01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:18.140
certain way, right? Almost like pivoting on a kind

1201
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.890
of central piece which is the sun. Uh And

1202
01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:23.589
then the body of des Cartes who's famous for

1203
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.259
his dualism, his mind, body, dualism. He still was

1204
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.009
a great anatomist and he spent a lot of

1205
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.220
his time studying the structures of the body and

1206
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.209
he thought the body was very much like a

1207
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.259
like a mechanical system. So for example, uh if

1208
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.759
I had my hand, if I were to open

1209
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:42.109
up my forearm, you'd see all these like tendons.

1210
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.750
And if I were to pull one, my finger

1211
01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:45.859
would move, right? He said this is like it's

1212
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.200
a machine, right? We are living machines, fast forward

1213
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:55.160
a few 100 years. And um the mechanistic approach

1214
01:08:55.169 --> 01:08:57.450
in the late nineties, early two thousands in the

1215
01:08:57.459 --> 01:09:01.310
philosophy of science, there was a group of philosophers

1216
01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:05.379
who said, what do scientists do when they try

1217
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.299
to explain something in the life sciences, when they're

1218
01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.859
trying to explain a cell or an organism or

1219
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.970
an environment or something like that, how do they

1220
01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:16.259
explain digestion or memory or whatever? And these, and

1221
01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:18.060
these people said, well, what they do is they,

1222
01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:21.578
they try to isolate as much as possible, their

1223
01:09:21.587 --> 01:09:24.618
target, they try to break it apart, they try

1224
01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.479
to understand the contributions of the parts and then

1225
01:09:27.488 --> 01:09:30.990
they try to understand what they do together. And

1226
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.629
so you have a mechanism when you can say

1227
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.890
this is the phenomenon, be it, you know, memory

1228
01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:40.509
like long term potentiation or digestion or whatever. And

1229
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.750
here's the starting point, here's what each of the

1230
01:09:43.759 --> 01:09:47.000
parts do. And here's the ending point. Now you

1231
01:09:47.009 --> 01:09:50.209
got a memory. Now you have digested food. Now

1232
01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.430
you have a new baby, right? Um And so

1233
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.490
this was, this is a very general sense in

1234
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.810
which you have a mechanism. The problem that the

1235
01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:05.850
mechanist quickly um realized was you can't always break

1236
01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:10.850
things apart and give an understanding of them outside

1237
01:10:10.859 --> 01:10:13.779
of their context, right? If you have say, um,

1238
01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:17.959
you know, uh a toilet and the toilet has,

1239
01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:22.029
you know, a handle and the handle lifts, the

1240
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.240
little thing on the inside which lets the water

1241
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.479
run. And if you wanna unders, if you want

1242
01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.470
to describe the mechanism of how a toilet flushes

1243
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.120
that handle is always just a handle, that flapper

1244
01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:35.589
is always just a flapper. The seat is always

1245
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.430
just a seat and you just add them together.

1246
01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:42.810
But pretty much most things actually in nature are

1247
01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:47.000
not like that, pretty much things always require a

1248
01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:52.649
context and their capacities require the situation, understanding the

1249
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:57.169
situation that they're in. And so this mechanistic approach

1250
01:10:57.509 --> 01:11:02.229
um had some problems and required some modification. So

1251
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.790
people started including descriptions of things as being decomposable.

1252
01:11:06.799 --> 01:11:11.529
So coming apart uh non decomposable. So systems that

1253
01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.729
um only work when they are a complete whole

1254
01:11:14.779 --> 01:11:17.779
and then you also have descriptions of nearly decomposable

1255
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.149
systems. So systems where you could kind of maybe

1256
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.729
get an idea of what the parts are contributing.

1257
01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.740
Uh YOU know, things like that. This has been

1258
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:30.020
of the most popular um way of understanding explanation

1259
01:11:30.029 --> 01:11:32.189
in the life sciences and philosophy of science. And

1260
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.390
it, it I think it tracks well with what

1261
01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:39.080
scientists, especially like neuroscientists and biologists are doing. So

1262
01:11:39.089 --> 01:11:42.040
what would be a non mechanistic approach? Well, a

1263
01:11:42.049 --> 01:11:45.839
non mes mechanistic approach to explanation could be something

1264
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:52.930
like a mathematical description. Um Einstein's equation uh Newton's

1265
01:11:52.939 --> 01:11:57.250
um differential equations of the solar system, these types

1266
01:11:57.259 --> 01:12:01.330
of things are not mechanistic, they have variables in

1267
01:12:01.339 --> 01:12:03.850
the equations that refer to real things in the

1268
01:12:03.859 --> 01:12:06.439
world. But when you are trying to understand how

1269
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.120
those things interact, you're paying more attention to the

1270
01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:12.490
relationship of variables than you are as opposed to

1271
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.509
the specifics. Uh So you kind of, you're abstracting

1272
01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.470
away a bit. Uh So that's one example of

1273
01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:25.470
a non mechanistic um approach. Um Yeah. Do,

1274
01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.919
do you think that in this particular case, if

1275
01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:33.330
we would have a mathematical explanation, perhaps one of

1276
01:12:33.339 --> 01:12:38.390
the reasons why maybe I don't know, psychologists and

1277
01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:43.270
neuroscience, neuroscientists, uh I mean, at least a big

1278
01:12:43.279 --> 01:12:48.250
number of them wouldn't be too fond of uh

1279
01:12:48.259 --> 01:12:53.689
an approach based also on complexity theory because I

1280
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.549
don't know, perhaps the mathematics there is a little

1281
01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.649
bit too complicated for most people. I mean, I,

1282
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.279
I'm not trying to claim that pe people from

1283
01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:07.080
those disciplines can't learn it. It's just that perhaps

1284
01:13:07.089 --> 01:13:11.580
they are not used to that level of mathematics.

1285
01:13:11.589 --> 01:13:12.080
I don't know,

1286
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.799
I think it's an excellent point. Um And, and

1287
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.250
I think, you know, now we're, now we're psychologizing

1288
01:13:19.259 --> 01:13:21.580
our scientists, right? We're trying to, and this might

1289
01:13:21.589 --> 01:13:24.750
require um its own kind of study, right? The

1290
01:13:24.759 --> 01:13:27.830
nature of, of, of scientists and what they, they

1291
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:32.560
prefer, you know, we could say again, broadly speaking,

1292
01:13:32.569 --> 01:13:35.839
um people go into physics because they want to

1293
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.240
understand the general principles of how things are organized,

1294
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:44.100
right? They wanna understand um you know, entropy, you

1295
01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:46.859
know, of, of, of the particles in a container.

1296
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:49.180
But they don't really care about the specific particle.

1297
01:13:49.549 --> 01:13:52.350
But someone might be interested in doing chemistry because

1298
01:13:52.359 --> 01:13:55.370
they care about the specific chemical structure, but they

1299
01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:58.529
care about biology because they care about identifying the

1300
01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.569
specific cells and the organs and how those things

1301
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.830
come together. And so there might be a tension

1302
01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:06.379
here where someone who's more, you know, quote unquote

1303
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:09.370
physics minded might say, oh, you biologist, you care

1304
01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:11.645
about all those methods, details. But what are you

1305
01:14:11.654 --> 01:14:15.745
really telling us? That's interesting. Similarly, the biologists you

1306
01:14:15.754 --> 01:14:17.825
know, might be looking at the physicist and saying

1307
01:14:17.834 --> 01:14:19.825
all you're giving me is all this crazy math

1308
01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:22.095
and you haven't really told me how anything actually

1309
01:14:22.104 --> 01:14:25.435
worked, right? It's like taking a car, right? Do

1310
01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:28.035
we wanna understand how combustion works or do we

1311
01:14:28.044 --> 01:14:31.950
want to understand how the parts fit together? Well,

1312
01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:35.229
I think these are different kinds of temperament, but

1313
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.640
my bet is that when it comes to understanding

1314
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:43.410
mind, cognition, perception, memory, all this kind of stuff,

1315
01:14:43.419 --> 01:14:49.109
right? That these emerge, these these properties, these abilities

1316
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.629
emerge from highly complex systems, highly complicated systems with

1317
01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.390
many degrees of freedom, right? And keeping track of

1318
01:15:00.399 --> 01:15:03.939
all those is gonna be really difficult. And in

1319
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:05.830
that sense, I think going the more kind of

1320
01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:08.479
physics route where you don't care about the location

1321
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:11.450
of every particle inside the container, but you care

1322
01:15:11.459 --> 01:15:15.229
about general kind of patterns of behavior. I think

1323
01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.609
that's gonna give us more scientific virtue like uh

1324
01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:26.370
manipulation, prediction, things like that with that sound is

1325
01:15:26.379 --> 01:15:30.720
the physics approach gonna develop any medication. Is the

1326
01:15:30.729 --> 01:15:34.250
physics approach gonna help, you know, cure cancer? II,

1327
01:15:34.259 --> 01:15:37.200
I think it could contribute to it. But I

1328
01:15:37.209 --> 01:15:39.080
think in, in that way, the kind of, you

1329
01:15:39.089 --> 01:15:42.290
know, medical approach, the anatomical approach, I think that's

1330
01:15:42.299 --> 01:15:45.700
gonna benefit uh from having someone who's more uh

1331
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:49.959
biological mechanistic minded, who wants to focus on the

1332
01:15:50.089 --> 01:15:54.609
the wet sticky detail, right? But as we're seeing,

1333
01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.560
I think there's, you know, a co evolution of

1334
01:15:56.569 --> 01:15:59.919
the two to help us understand mine, it's gonna

1335
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:03.459
take both approaches, but I lean towards my intuition

1336
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:05.959
is that it leans more towards the physics kinds

1337
01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:06.580
of stuff.

1338
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.279
So let me ask you one last question then

1339
01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:14.209
still related to the challenges to your proposal. Because

1340
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:17.120
I mean, I guess that one of the main

1341
01:16:17.129 --> 01:16:19.660
things that you pointed to here is the fact

1342
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:23.600
that you would have to convince many different kinds

1343
01:16:23.609 --> 01:16:28.154
of people from the different disciplines, different theoretical frameworks

1344
01:16:28.165 --> 01:16:30.705
and so on. So do you think that perhaps

1345
01:16:30.714 --> 01:16:33.774
one of the challenges here and it, it's not

1346
01:16:33.785 --> 01:16:38.285
only to your framework or to convincing other people

1347
01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:43.149
that potentially your framework is correct, but also perhaps

1348
01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.640
a broader question that applies to the to your

1349
01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:52.379
book in general also to perhaps understanding why it

1350
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:55.939
is that different disciplines, even though they might be

1351
01:16:55.950 --> 01:17:01.649
focusing on similar objects of study might diverge so

1352
01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.323
much historically. Do you think that has anything to

1353
01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:11.212
do with how difficult it is to have interdisciplinary

1354
01:17:11.223 --> 01:17:15.862
in academia and the university context? Because people are

1355
01:17:15.873 --> 01:17:21.663
trained in specific areas, specific domains with specific theoretical

1356
01:17:21.672 --> 01:17:24.922
approaches, methodologies and so on. And of course, then

1357
01:17:24.933 --> 01:17:28.326
they have their careers and it's based on the

1358
01:17:28.335 --> 01:17:31.465
kinds of things they have been working with the

1359
01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:34.255
frameworks they have been applying. And of course, it's

1360
01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:39.076
also uh many times extremely difficult for people to

1361
01:17:39.085 --> 01:17:45.416
acquire enough knowledge, enough competence about other disciplines and

1362
01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:48.735
methodologies and frameworks. So do you think that perhaps

1363
01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:53.529
uh in the context of your book in general?

1364
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:57.270
Um THIS is uh something that we need, we

1365
01:17:57.279 --> 01:17:59.720
need to take into account and perhaps presents a

1366
01:17:59.729 --> 01:18:01.629
big obstacle here.

1367
01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.120
I think it's an excellent point. Um I wish

1368
01:18:06.129 --> 01:18:08.359
I had asked you to ask me this question

1369
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:12.310
because it, it's it, it is such an excellent

1370
01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:17.160
point. Um You know, the, the way that yeah,

1371
01:18:17.169 --> 01:18:21.919
the way that knowledge acquisition happens, um you know,

1372
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:24.729
in, in our systems and our culture is to

1373
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.850
have this kind of, you know, siloed, you know,

1374
01:18:26.859 --> 01:18:28.529
discipline, you have a, you know, you have your

1375
01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.220
Department of Physics, your Department of Chemistry, you know,

1376
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:34.919
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Um And for

1377
01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.879
good reason, right. Because you can only do so

1378
01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:39.830
much. So, I'm, I'm kind of repeating a little

1379
01:18:39.839 --> 01:18:41.779
bit what you're saying in agreement, right? You can

1380
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:43.450
only get, you know, you get your ph getting

1381
01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:46.729
one phd is hard enough, right? And then getting

1382
01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:49.250
good at it is a whole other level, right?

1383
01:18:49.259 --> 01:18:53.339
And making contributions and pushing the field forward, whatever

1384
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:56.709
the field it is, it's literature, history, economics, physics,

1385
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:59.410
right. Getting good enough because there's so we know

1386
01:18:59.419 --> 01:19:02.069
so much, we have so much information that we

1387
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.259
have to deal with just within one discipline alone.

1388
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.490
Um How are we supposed to engage with these

1389
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.839
really complicated difficult topics like mine, cognition, intelligence. Well,

1390
01:19:15.899 --> 01:19:19.479
one thing is to say um the discipline that

1391
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:23.439
I do, that's the right discipline and right. So

1392
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:27.009
I'm a neuroscientist and I care about biochemistry and

1393
01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.930
that's how you're gonna do it, right? That's one

1394
01:19:28.939 --> 01:19:32.169
way to approach it. And you say everyone else

1395
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.240
is wrong, another way to approach it is to

1396
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:37.930
say I'm a neuroscientist. I care about the biochemistry,

1397
01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.240
but I know I need to talk to other

1398
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.370
people who do other things and I need to

1399
01:19:42.379 --> 01:19:44.919
make connections and you know, to see how we

1400
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.649
connect in that way to give a more complete

1401
01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:51.620
account, more complete explanation. But when is that supposed

1402
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:54.759
to happen? When does that conversation happen? Not in

1403
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:58.209
the journals? Right? In the journals, they just publish

1404
01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.020
very specific kind of issues, right? Very very limited,

1405
01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:05.109
right? You look at a neuroscience journal and they,

1406
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.669
they say, well, we are now looking at molecule

1407
01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.520
X that's an AX on receptor 32. And this,

1408
01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:13.870
and I spend my whole career, you know, doing

1409
01:20:13.879 --> 01:20:15.600
that. Well, what does that have to do with

1410
01:20:15.609 --> 01:20:19.350
cognition? If anything? Right? I, I don't know, but

1411
01:20:19.359 --> 01:20:22.109
someone needs to be talking about this. Uh AND,

1412
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.660
and, and trying to bring these things together, the

1413
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:30.669
establishment um doesn't reward that kind of work, right?

1414
01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.580
Whenever you publish in the top journals, you're usually

1415
01:20:33.589 --> 01:20:36.990
very focused. When you get grant money, it's to,

1416
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.669
to look at very specific kinds of issues where

1417
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.140
you already kind of know how the problem is

1418
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:45.779
gonna be solved. You kind of, you end up

1419
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:49.229
especially in the US institutions with, with grant funding,

1420
01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:51.310
you kind of have to already have succeeded in

1421
01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:54.490
your project in order to get the money. Um

1422
01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.060
AND, and, and so where's the risk and where's

1423
01:20:57.069 --> 01:21:00.500
the interdisciplinary when it's other people who are very

1424
01:21:00.509 --> 01:21:03.439
specific and focused, who are making the the decisions

1425
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:06.049
about whether your grant gets funded or your paper

1426
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.850
gets published. So the system itself makes it very

1427
01:21:08.859 --> 01:21:14.479
difficult to um embrace these multi scale kinds of

1428
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:18.600
approaches. Um As I think my approach is, I

1429
01:21:18.609 --> 01:21:20.370
think sometimes this is the luxury of being a

1430
01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:23.649
philosopher is um I get to kind of, you

1431
01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.620
know, I get, I get to dabble in these

1432
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:30.290
different areas, right? Um But I also thought at

1433
01:21:30.299 --> 01:21:32.740
least personally, if I want to explain or at

1434
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:35.609
least engage with the sciences of the things I'm

1435
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.790
interested in like cognition or intelligence, I think I

1436
01:21:38.799 --> 01:21:42.520
should have had some training to see what these

1437
01:21:42.529 --> 01:21:45.160
scientists do. And so I have, I have training

1438
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:48.899
in experimental psychology and neuroscience because I wanted to

1439
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:52.040
see kind of what the philosophers are saying. And

1440
01:21:52.049 --> 01:21:53.689
if it makes any sense, I wanted to see

1441
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.149
what the neuroscientists are doing that the philosophers are

1442
01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.689
right or wrong about, but it's been really hard

1443
01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.569
to do. Um And not everyone wants to do

1444
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.240
that. Um NOR should they uh you end up

1445
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.540
getting more successful if you focus on a limited

1446
01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:10.640
range of things and get really good at that.

1447
01:22:11.049 --> 01:22:15.520
So, yeah, I think interdisciplinary, I think um the

1448
01:22:15.529 --> 01:22:18.120
way the system is set up of reward in

1449
01:22:18.129 --> 01:22:21.629
academia and things like that, I think that's definitely

1450
01:22:22.029 --> 01:22:27.759
poses a challenge to providing a multidisciplinary multis scale

1451
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:31.759
account of very complicated phenomenon. Mhm

1452
01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.379
You know, one of the reasons why I asked

1453
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:37.790
you that question is that, I mean, perhaps uh

1454
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:41.830
I have a privileged position because I'm able to

1455
01:22:41.839 --> 01:22:44.839
do this full time. And I talk, I get

1456
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.279
to talk with people from many, many different disciplines,

1457
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:53.770
mostly the psychological, behavioral evolutionary sciences, but also from

1458
01:22:53.779 --> 01:22:58.774
other areas. And I mean, I understand it's perfectly

1459
01:22:58.785 --> 01:23:02.854
understandable that people of course cannot learn all of

1460
01:23:02.865 --> 01:23:05.365
these and neither can I, I mean, I only

1461
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:10.345
know tiny bits of uh everything, let's say. But,

1462
01:23:10.555 --> 01:23:14.104
um, I mean, it's perfectly understandable. But on the

1463
01:23:14.115 --> 01:23:18.234
other hand, sometimes I see a lot of people

1464
01:23:18.245 --> 01:23:22.330
from this different disciplines dealing with the same subjects

1465
01:23:22.459 --> 01:23:26.509
talking past each other just because they are not

1466
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.250
versed on what the other people, what the other

1467
01:23:30.259 --> 01:23:33.729
person is working on. The kinds of theoretical approaches.

1468
01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.740
They have the kinds of methodologies, they apply uh

1469
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:41.709
concepts and so on and, and, and sometimes it's

1470
01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.415
really, it, it can become really frustrating to see

1471
01:23:45.424 --> 01:23:50.044
that perhaps people are clinging so much to their

1472
01:23:50.055 --> 01:23:54.754
own. I don't know, pet theories or pet methodologies

1473
01:23:54.765 --> 01:24:00.435
or their own uh preferred frameworks. And just very,

1474
01:24:00.685 --> 01:24:03.095
and perhaps this is the part that frustrates me

1475
01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:09.370
the most just easily dismiss uh some other things

1476
01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:12.540
that or, or other approaches that other people have

1477
01:24:12.689 --> 01:24:17.229
and many times it's because they don't even have

1478
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:21.189
a good enough understanding of what the, the other

1479
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.910
people are coming from because again, they don't have

1480
01:24:24.919 --> 01:24:27.830
enough knowledge about it. I mean, ii, I don't

1481
01:24:27.839 --> 01:24:30.859
know if you agree with what I'm saying here

1482
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:33.370
or if you, we and the criticisms of it.

1483
01:24:33.859 --> 01:24:36.359
No, I agree. And I'll take you one step

1484
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:39.350
further and here's another hot take. I think a

1485
01:24:39.359 --> 01:24:43.830
lot of scientists um don't even really understand the

1486
01:24:43.839 --> 01:24:47.770
commitments of their own discipline. And I say that

1487
01:24:47.779 --> 01:24:49.470
as a matter of fact, not as a value

1488
01:24:49.479 --> 01:24:53.850
judgment because there is no need to question uh

1489
01:24:53.859 --> 01:24:58.790
the commitments, right? Um So Thomas Coon, uh historian,

1490
01:24:58.799 --> 01:25:03.049
philosopher of science, he talks about normal science. Normal

1491
01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:05.890
Science is when you have a community of people

1492
01:25:05.899 --> 01:25:08.839
who speak the same language, right? So maybe we'll

1493
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:10.859
take a biologist, they kind of understand what a

1494
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:13.520
gene is, what a cell is. Uh They have

1495
01:25:13.529 --> 01:25:16.750
shared methods like, you know, basic statistical analysis. They

1496
01:25:16.759 --> 01:25:20.529
all understand that they all, you know, read the

1497
01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.620
same journals, they all um teach the same textbooks,

1498
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:26.910
right? They all have an idea of what experiments

1499
01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:28.939
should look like and what an answer should look

1500
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:31.069
like. And this is just normal everyday kind of

1501
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.020
science. They don't have to question whether a gene

1502
01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:37.674
really is exist or whether, you know, what is

1503
01:25:37.685 --> 01:25:40.444
a spell or what, you know, are these statistical

1504
01:25:40.455 --> 01:25:43.435
methods found? They don't have to uh and they

1505
01:25:43.444 --> 01:25:46.214
probably as a discipline would be worse off if

1506
01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:48.225
they paid attention to that, they can make a

1507
01:25:48.234 --> 01:25:53.209
lot of progress by just accepting the paradigm, right?

1508
01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.959
The problem though is when you start hitting, you

1509
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:58.120
know, at least what Thomas Coon said, you start

1510
01:25:58.129 --> 01:26:00.649
hitting anomalies like, right? Too many things that you

1511
01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.089
can't explain or when things get too messy, that's

1512
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.729
when scientists are questioning their paradigm. And so I

1513
01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:12.709
totally understand and I totally respect uh the, the

1514
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.629
day to day scientist who doesn't have to question

1515
01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.910
the foundation and they don't have to pay attention

1516
01:26:17.919 --> 01:26:23.919
to anybody else. Um But if you have that,

1517
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:27.569
that tendency, if you have that personality, that questions

1518
01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:31.200
things, um it's very easy to find what people

1519
01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:33.279
don't know about even their own discipline.

1520
01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.319
OK, great. So perhaps this is a good point

1521
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:41.180
to wrap up the interview. And the book is

1522
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:44.939
again the ecological brain unifying the sciences of brain,

1523
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.870
body and environment. I'm leaving a link to it

1524
01:26:47.879 --> 01:26:50.439
in the description box of the interview. And Doctor

1525
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:53.189
Favela, apart from the book, would you like to

1526
01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.009
tell people again, where can, where they can find

1527
01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.939
you and your work on the internet?
