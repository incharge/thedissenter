00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:05.699
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.850
joined by Doctor Hiram Lewis. He's a professor of

4
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:13.029
History at Brigham Young University Idaho. And today we're

5
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.170
talking about his book written together with Verlin Lewis,

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.040
the myth of left and right, how the political

7
00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:24.950
spectrum misleads and harms Americans. So, Doctor Louis, welcome

8
00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.649
to the show. It's a pleasure to have everyone.

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.120
Mhm Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.500
So let's start perhaps with the premise of the

11
00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.400
book. So you get into ideology in the book.

12
00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.590
And uh at the very beginning, you mentioned the

13
00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:42.090
fact that you don't think or at least you

14
00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:46.740
make the claim that standard explanations for political polarization,

15
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.424
which is some thing that people are very much

16
00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:54.325
worried about nowadays, particularly in America explanations like media

17
00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:59.924
echo chambers party polarization, racism status, anxiety, social hoop

18
00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:05.175
and others are not enough to explain. Uh uh

19
00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:08.455
I mean, uh ba basically to explain the, the

20
00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:11.919
issues you explore in the book. So why do

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.239
we also need ideology and why do you think

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.440
that these explanations are not enough?

23
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.500
Yeah, because ideas have consequences and when our ideas

24
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.959
are wrong, when our concepts are wrong, then things

25
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.599
go terribly wrong in whatever domain we're mis conceptualizing.

26
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.709
So, for instance, in the 19th century and earlier

27
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.430
doctors had a misconception of how the body worked.

28
00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:37.309
They thought that health was promoted by having a

29
00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.849
balance of four humors. And that mis conceptualization was

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.069
extremely prevalent and it caused doctors to kill who

31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.110
knows how many people. So doctors killed far more

32
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.839
people than they saved in the 18th century. And

33
00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.769
for most of the 19th century, because that mis

34
00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:54.319
conceptualization, read them, led them to diagnose things incorrectly

35
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.830
and therefore to treat things incorrectly. And we say

36
00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.860
that a mis conceptualization is having the same effect

37
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.389
on politics today. And so, yeah, there's a lot

38
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.589
of things wrong with politics, but we could sure

39
00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.080
improve it by getting our concepts better and thinking

40
00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:08.899
about it in a more accurate and clear way.

41
00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.789
And what is the standard view that people tend

42
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.970
to have of ideology? There is what in your

43
00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.990
book, you call the essentialist theory of ideology? Could

44
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.809
you explain that?

45
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.740
Yeah. Sure. So the standard view, the way that

46
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.259
most people think of ideology and the way that

47
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.139
I was taught it and the way that i

48
00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.589
it's still taught today in political science classes and

49
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.690
civics classes and you know, even high school government

50
00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.669
classes for heaven's sake is the idea that politics

51
00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.690
is all about. One big thing that we have

52
00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.279
big disagreements because there's, there's one issue and everybody

53
00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.899
has disagreed radically on that one issue. Now, the

54
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.830
funny thing is, is everyone has disagrees about what

55
00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.990
that one issue is, but they're all convinced that

56
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.929
there's just one big one and a standard, a

57
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.830
standard view of what that one issue is, is

58
00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.630
changed. That's what I was taught that, that you're,

59
00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.580
you're somewhere on a spectrum, uh, a left right,

60
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.350
political spectrum based on your view of change. So

61
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.630
if you're really in favor of change, really, really

62
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.119
in favor of it, then you're on the far

63
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.190
left. If you're really, really against change, then you're

64
00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.949
on the far right. And then if you like

65
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.509
some change, but not too much, you're on the

66
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.820
center left, if you're against change, but not too

67
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.350
against change or on the center, right and so

68
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.740
forth. And the idea being that there aren't a

69
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.279
lot of issues in politics, there's just one and,

70
00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.110
and the stance you take on that one big

71
00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.860
issue determines your stance on all the other issues.

72
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.720
Um So that's the essentialist theory of ideology or

73
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.580
we might call it the monist theory of politics.

74
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.899
It's the idea that politics is just about one

75
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.889
big thing. And so the, the explanation people have

76
00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.360
today as to why there's so much discord in

77
00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.800
politics is because our two parties have taken that

78
00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.020
one issue to extremes. The Democrats, according to the

79
00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.570
standard of explanation have moved to the left and

80
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.300
the Republicans, according to the standard explanation have moved

81
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.960
to the extreme, right. This is what everybody's saying

82
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.279
and it's just completely false. There's no evidence that

83
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.300
it's true. Uh, BUT people say it and they

84
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.740
think if they say it enough times it'll become

85
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.250
true by repetition but it's not.

86
00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.809
But about that view, of course, you've already mentioned

87
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.919
at least one issue or in your view, what

88
00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.449
one of the issues is there. But what are

89
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.920
perhaps some of the biggest misunderstandings that in your

90
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.559
view, people have about political ideology?

91
00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:24.950
Yeah. Well, I mean, the idea that there's just

92
00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.350
one issue in politics is the big misunderstanding that

93
00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.529
we're trying to puncture. And so they, instead of

94
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.630
looking at politics in a pluralistic way and saying,

95
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.410
you know, there's one issue and that size of

96
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.709
government and the Republican Party is much more favorable

97
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.239
to big government and it ever has been in

98
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.510
its history. George W Bush was the biggest spender

99
00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:43.089
in the history of this country. He was by

100
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.399
far the biggest government president of all times. So

101
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.890
you can say, hey, he was in favor of

102
00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.390
big government, there's a scale of big to small

103
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.079
government and he was more of a big government

104
00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:54.359
guy. That's not too hard to say. Uh, YOU

105
00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:55.880
could say George W Bush was more of a

106
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.500
militarist, he believed in invading countries, um uh to

107
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.059
spread democracy and so forth. That's another issue, more

108
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.760
or less military intervention. But instead of looking at

109
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:07.029
those as two separate issues and discussing Bush and

110
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.209
his policies in terms of those two distinct issues,

111
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.980
people simply said George W Bush moved the Republican

112
00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:15.406
party to the extreme, right? Pretending that there was

113
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.816
just one issue pretending that George W Bush hates

114
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:20.555
change. And therefore, since he hates change, he's also

115
00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:23.635
a rabid racist. Uh, HE also wants to close

116
00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:25.686
the border and throw out all illegal immigrants. He

117
00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:27.656
also wants to invade foreign countries because he's a

118
00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:30.335
militarist. He also wants to cut government spending and

119
00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:31.696
these kinds of things. And that was just all

120
00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:34.552
nonsense. You have to look issue by issue. You

121
00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:37.201
get an accurate conception of what politics is about

122
00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:39.731
and, and, and pretending there's just one issue and

123
00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:42.242
that Bush can be explained, can be placed on

124
00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:44.261
the far right of a one issue spectrum is

125
00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:47.582
just so destructive to public discourse. Um So we're

126
00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:49.721
asking for simply to do what we do in

127
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:52.601
every other realm of life and that's talk about

128
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:55.660
individual things. We talk granularly. When we go to

129
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.059
the doctor, we don't say uh the doctors and

130
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.339
say, well, let me place you on a, on

131
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.200
a medical spectrum. You have cancer. Well, uh cancer

132
00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:05.839
and fractures and bruises are on the left. And

133
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.079
since you have cancer, we're gonna put you on

134
00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.540
the left side of that spectrum. Now we just

135
00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:10.149
say you have cancer. We don't pretend that your

136
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.929
cancer has anything to do with fractures. Likewise, we

137
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.549
should stop pretending that smaller government has anything to

138
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.470
do with militarism. They in fact work at cross

139
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.679
purposes and yet we call both radical expansions in

140
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.954
the size of the government to fight war and

141
00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:24.994
radical decreases in governments in the name of free

142
00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:26.635
markets. We call them both right wing when they're

143
00:06:26.644 --> 00:06:29.445
opposite policies. So it really is uh uh the,

144
00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:32.795
the best way to say it is silly. It's,

145
00:06:32.804 --> 00:06:35.204
it's childish. Um And we need to stop being

146
00:06:35.214 --> 00:06:36.904
childish. We need to grow up as a society.

147
00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:38.704
We've grown up in other realms and we talk

148
00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:41.575
about other realms profitably and medicine works much better

149
00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:44.035
when we gave up our simple but flawed model.

150
00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:46.515
And so we're saying that politics will work much

151
00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:48.464
better once we give up our simple but flawed

152
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:49.535
model of politics.

153
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.640
But that's about what people commonly think about the

154
00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.640
divide between the left and the right, particularly in

155
00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:01.410
America. But we're also trying to approach things here

156
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.440
from a scientific perspective. And so what would you

157
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.899
say are perhaps some of the main testable predictions

158
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.790
that the essentialist theory of ideology makes? And where

159
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.160
do you think they fail the most?

160
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.170
That's the problem with the essentialist theory of ideology

161
00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:20.910
because you're right. Science is all about prediction, isn't

162
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.190
it? It's all about testing theories out. It says

163
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.470
if our theory um is is false, all we

164
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.299
should find all of these things Right. So, so

165
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.220
falsification is a crucial scientific criteria. It says theories

166
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.019
predict and it doesn't just say it predicts everything.

167
00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.760
A good theory says, we predict very specific things.

168
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.070
And if those things don't happen, we're willing to

169
00:07:41.154 --> 00:07:44.255
uh consider our theory wrong. Uh WE'RE willing to

170
00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:47.635
discon FRM our theory, the essentialist theory, nobody puts

171
00:07:47.644 --> 00:07:51.095
forward dis discon confirmation criteria. So they say there's

172
00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:53.584
only one issue in politics and that all these

173
00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:55.815
many things go together. They say, for instance, if

174
00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:58.625
you're um if you're uh in favor of abort,

175
00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:00.375
um if you want to restrict a woman's right

176
00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:04.054
to choose and you're pro-life, then you are also

177
00:08:04.065 --> 00:08:07.869
um uh in favor of lower tariff rates. OK.

178
00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:11.290
Those two things go together. What's your evidence? Well,

179
00:08:11.299 --> 00:08:14.230
turns out that there isn't any evidence because it

180
00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:17.040
10 years later that it switched and now people

181
00:08:17.049 --> 00:08:20.190
who are pro-life are in favor of tariffs. So,

182
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.269
so the constant switching of the positions now that's

183
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.399
not what the essentialist theory would have predicted. They

184
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.269
said these things, two things go together because they're

185
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:30.070
bound because somehow being in favor of free trade

186
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.640
means you hate change and somehow being in favor

187
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.308
of a woman's right to choose means you hate

188
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.260
change. They're both hate change positions, supposedly according to

189
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.609
this very odd but very prevalent theory. OK. But

190
00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:42.390
if they go together, then why did it suddenly

191
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.520
switch? Why is it now that people who are

192
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.080
pro-life are much more against free trade than people

193
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.020
who are pro choice. That's a flip in the

194
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.030
last 10 years. Likewise, if being pro life is

195
00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:57.710
also connected fundamentally to um favoring the invasion of

196
00:08:57.719 --> 00:08:59.859
Iraq. Well, then why is that switched? People who

197
00:08:59.869 --> 00:09:03.090
are pro life are much less likely to favor

198
00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:04.830
uh to be in favor of the invasion of

199
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.989
Iraq now. So, so these things just don't go

200
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.059
together and, and yet, instead of acknowledging that and

201
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.229
saying, oh, that's discon confirmation evidence, people make up

202
00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:17.710
stories. And so these stories get very, very creative.

203
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.109
So the only quote evidence you can find for

204
00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:22.690
the essentialist theory is expose storytelling, but we can

205
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.570
prove anything with expo stories. Um So astrology, I

206
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.109
i it's funny because none of my academic colleagues

207
00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:31.520
believe in astrology. They all recognize that if you

208
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.020
go into an astrologer's office, they're just gonna say,

209
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.530
what month were you born in? What are your

210
00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.330
behaviors? Well, let me cook up the story to

211
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.950
show how your behaviors fit your astrological science. And

212
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.080
let's say that's pseudoscience, it doesn't make predictions. This

213
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.130
is just telling the stories after the fact. And

214
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.450
almost all of my colleagues believe that there's one

215
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.200
issue in politics. They believe the essentialist theory that

216
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.640
there's just one big issue. And yet the evidence

217
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.330
when I ask them for evidence is all the

218
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.000
same kind of storytelling, the astrologer does. So that's

219
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.179
the problem with the Essentialist theory is it doesn't

220
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.320
make any predictions, it doesn't say what we should

221
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.520
find or what we shouldn't find. So, uh that,

222
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.309
that, that's the big problem there. We can go

223
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.489
into the pluralist theory, our theory of ideology if

224
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.950
you like. But um that's where we are with

225
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.760
the essentialist theory.

226
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.020
So to try to get past that sort of

227
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.900
storytelling that you talk about there in the book,

228
00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:20.900
you present a social conception of ideology. So uh

229
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.950
what does it, uh I mean, basically what are

230
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.580
the main ideas associated with that conception?

231
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.820
Yeah. So the social theory of ideology or we

232
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.580
might call it the uh pluralist theory of ideology

233
00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.260
or the pluralist theory of politics, I should say.

234
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.960
So the, the social theory says the reason you

235
00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:42.780
find a correlation between distinct issues is social conformism.

236
00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:45.080
So, so again, I said, there's no evidence for

237
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.099
the essentialist theory. Um THERE isn't or at least

238
00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:49.950
there's none that can't better be explained by the

239
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.780
social theory. So, so, so the big piece of

240
00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:53.500
evidence, I mean, the one that leads people to

241
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.780
believe in the, in the essentialist theory and the

242
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:57.799
reason it's so prevalent and the reason all of

243
00:10:57.809 --> 00:10:59.729
my high school history teachers and all my college

244
00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:01.520
history teachers and all of my high school government

245
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.630
teachers and all the rest believed in this political

246
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.359
spectrum is they said, well, it, it explains something,

247
00:11:06.369 --> 00:11:09.679
it explains a curious sociological fact. It explains that

248
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.900
if you, if you find somebody who's pro life.

249
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.219
You can also predict with better than random accuracy,

250
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.500
their position on taxes and on the war in

251
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.330
Iraq and on affirmative action and on climate change,

252
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.940
right. So there is predictive value, it's not random.

253
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.219
So how do we explain this non randomness? How

254
00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:30.070
do we explain this correlation? And so their default

255
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.909
explanation which is incorrect, but this is their explanation.

256
00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.750
It says, well, they must be connected at some

257
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.719
deep level. There must just be one deep issue

258
00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:40.950
binding everything else because we see correlations happening in

259
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.989
these binary packages and one package of positions. It's

260
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.469
you know, 100 distinct positions, but they're all called

261
00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:47.909
left wing and they go together and if you

262
00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.530
meet somebody who says I'm a left winger, they

263
00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:52.479
all hold this package of left wing positions. Why

264
00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:54.349
is it that those go together and then there's

265
00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:56.994
this other package of things that go together and

266
00:11:57.005 --> 00:11:58.534
when you meet someone who says I'm a conservative,

267
00:11:58.544 --> 00:12:00.164
these things all go together. So why do you

268
00:12:00.174 --> 00:12:03.974
find them, them bundling into two packages? And they

269
00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:06.265
say, oh it must be that there's one deep

270
00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:09.015
issue, binding them together and that one issue we

271
00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:11.195
can, we can model one issue on a spectrum.

272
00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:12.914
So we put people on a spectrum and so

273
00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:15.854
this bin nity and and and and the packaging

274
00:12:15.864 --> 00:12:18.984
and the correlating of distinct issue positions, people explain

275
00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:22.114
it uh with an underlying essence. So, so that's

276
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:24.659
why it's so popular. It explains that. The problem

277
00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:26.840
is, is that it's much better explained by the

278
00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:29.229
social theory. And the social theory says those things

279
00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:31.760
don't correlate because they're philosophically bound or bound by

280
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.349
a conservative temperament or a liberal temperament or your

281
00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:37.400
underlying view on change, these different views are bound

282
00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:40.570
together by a common tribe. So why is it

283
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.489
that somebody who is pro life is also more,

284
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.789
more likely than average to favor tax cuts? Well,

285
00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.210
the first thing that we need to notice is

286
00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:48.849
Ween and Kan have found uh they're these professors

287
00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:50.369
of the University of Pennsylvania, but they found that,

288
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.270
that um that it doesn't correlate nearly as well

289
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.159
as people think uh the, the percent, you know,

290
00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:59.500
it's slightly better than a corn coin flip. I

291
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.010
if somebody is pro-life, they're only slightly better than

292
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.229
a coin flip just slightly higher than 50% likely

293
00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:07.320
to also believe in tax cuts, right? So, so

294
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.679
it's a very slight correlation, but we say that

295
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.650
correlation exists because people are conforming to their tribes.

296
00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:15.500
So a common pattern would be, let's say you

297
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.130
have somebody who's a hardcore Catholic and they believe

298
00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.380
strongly that abortion is murder. That's a respectable position.

299
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.419
II, I respect it. I don't necessarily agree with

300
00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:26.239
all of it, but, ok. Well, once you believe

301
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.119
that, then how are you going to socialize into

302
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.219
politics where you're gonna anchor into a group? You're

303
00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:33.840
gonna seek out other people who are pro-life and

304
00:13:33.849 --> 00:13:36.440
those pro-life people will be on Fox News and

305
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.989
they will be in the Republican Party and they

306
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.729
will be at CPAC and they will be watching

307
00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:41.500
Sean Hannity, right? They will, they will, they will

308
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.140
be on uh on the social media sites and

309
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.830
so forth. And once you find those people who

310
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.489
are pro-life, it turns out that they're also because

311
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.619
the Republican Party is also more like in favor

312
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.830
of tax cuts. So you will socialize into that

313
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.109
view of tax cuts, not because tax cuts and

314
00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:02.599
opposing abortion are fundamentally connected. They're clearly not. But

315
00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:04.989
because there is a social group, there is a

316
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.059
tribe that connects those two things electorally in a

317
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.969
party and you will get socialized into that party.

318
00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:13.909
So we have a two party system, we don't

319
00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:17.210
have a 11 spectrum system. The two party system

320
00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:19.469
gives us the illusion of a single spectrum.

321
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.500
So just to take a a small step back

322
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.010
before we get into the implications that the social

323
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.809
or pluralist theory of political ideology has for how

324
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.510
we think about politics more generally. What are the

325
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.969
origins of the terms left and right, historically.

326
00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:42.690
Yeah, as best as we can tell it originated

327
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.609
in the French revolution. So and again, you know,

328
00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:47.570
people say two party system, not every country has

329
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.489
a two party system. Well true. But even if

330
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.369
you have a multiparty system, you do wind up

331
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.760
with two coalitions, right? And the reason is is

332
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.979
that is that political, human types are not binary,

333
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.059
but politics naturally coalesces into a binary because in

334
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.020
democratic systems, especially you have rule and oppose rule

335
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.989
and that's binary, right? So you have the ruler

336
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.669
and then the people like the whigs in England

337
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:12.159
who opposed the ruler and so forth. So it

338
00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:13.500
had in the French revolution is you had the

339
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.409
king and the monarch and then you had those

340
00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:17.359
people who tended to support the monarch and those

341
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:19.260
people who tend to oppose the monarch. So when

342
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.820
they met together in the assembly hall, the people

343
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.570
who were opposed to the monarch tended to started

344
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.169
to coalesce onto the left side of the hall

345
00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:30.059
or the left wing, right. It was an architectural

346
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.119
term into the left wing of the hall. And

347
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.429
the people who tended to favor the monarch would

348
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.989
tend to coalesce into the right side or right

349
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.169
wing of the hall. So then we got this

350
00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:42.010
idea that you how much you favor the king

351
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.799
could be placed on a spectrum, left wing, right

352
00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:47.955
wing, more favoring on the right, less favoring on

353
00:15:47.966 --> 00:15:49.656
the left kind of lukewarm towards the king in

354
00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:52.185
the middle. Now again, when we're talking about one

355
00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:55.325
issue, it works. If there really was just one

356
00:15:55.335 --> 00:15:57.676
issue in politics, king or no king, it would

357
00:15:57.685 --> 00:16:00.356
work. But politics isn't about one thing. It's not

358
00:16:00.366 --> 00:16:02.666
just about abortion, it's not just about the king

359
00:16:02.676 --> 00:16:03.916
and how you feel about a king. It's not

360
00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:06.135
just about tax rates, it's not just about the

361
00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:08.382
environment, it's about all these different things and we

362
00:16:08.392 --> 00:16:10.791
can't model all of them on a single spectrum.

363
00:16:10.901 --> 00:16:14.442
So unfortunately, because of that political spectrum originated in

364
00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:17.471
France, that way of thinking of the idea of

365
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:20.302
a spectrum then spread. And so today, uh every

366
00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:23.601
country that has been infected by European colonialism basically

367
00:16:23.611 --> 00:16:26.812
now thinks in this really ridiculous terms of one

368
00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:27.651
issue politics.

369
00:16:28.539 --> 00:16:31.010
So I mean, in a sense, at least this

370
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.880
is also a historical accident, right? Because if it

371
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.729
had been any other way, instead of just a

372
00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:42.159
split between two sides, it had been between three

373
00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:45.340
sides, four sides. I mean, that would be the

374
00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:48.690
norm now, at least in countries who were influenced

375
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.330
by these Western, let's say standard, right?

376
00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:54.817
Sure. And that's what we see happening in these

377
00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:57.406
different countries before the political spectrum takes. So, I

378
00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.577
mean, it was true in the United States of

379
00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:02.057
America too before about 1920. You know, Jonah Goldberg,

380
00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:04.136
he was, he, he I was talking to him

381
00:17:04.146 --> 00:17:06.256
and he was, you know, I think trying to

382
00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:08.607
hint that maybe the political spectrum is natural because

383
00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.876
he said, is there any advanced industrial democracy that

384
00:17:10.886 --> 00:17:12.756
doesn't use the political spectrum or hasn't used the

385
00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:15.046
political spectrum? I said yes, the United States before

386
00:17:15.057 --> 00:17:17.124
1920 if you go, go back and look at

387
00:17:17.134 --> 00:17:19.163
the writings of Abraham Lincoln or, or look at

388
00:17:19.173 --> 00:17:21.823
the rhetoric of you know, William Jennings Bryan or,

389
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.703
or James Garfield or George Washington. For heaven's sake.

390
00:17:24.713 --> 00:17:26.634
You just go back and look and, and there's

391
00:17:26.644 --> 00:17:30.744
no talk, none of wings of left wing, right

392
00:17:30.754 --> 00:17:34.073
wing, center, left center, right. This all came later.

393
00:17:34.083 --> 00:17:36.213
Did we have a two party system? Sure that

394
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.394
people were not under the delusion that the two

395
00:17:38.404 --> 00:17:40.600
parties were defined by a spectrum in the, you

396
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.431
could move along a spectrum because all the different

397
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:44.350
issues in politics went together. They didn't have that

398
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.630
delusion. They understood that you could be against tariffs

399
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.551
and in favor of a gold standard. Uh AND,

400
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:51.970
and be in favor of, I don't know, racial

401
00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.850
equality, right? That these were three distinct things. So

402
00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.831
Abraham Lincoln said I am against slavery. That's one

403
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.031
thing I am also in favor of the protective

404
00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:02.490
tariff. That's another thing I'm also in favor of

405
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.099
subsidies for big business. That's another thing is that

406
00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:06.449
left wing or right wing. It is, it, it

407
00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:09.430
is and does not compute should shout back at

408
00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:12.010
us because it's completely absurd to place Lincoln on

409
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.250
a spectrum when one, he didn't place him self

410
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.079
on a spectrum and two the diversity of positions

411
00:18:17.089 --> 00:18:19.040
he took doesn't in any way line up with

412
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.859
either of our two parties or two ideologies today.

413
00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:24.469
So, no, we didn't have to have a political

414
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.349
spectrum. It was a historical accident, I think, but

415
00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.239
it was a, it was, it was a convenient

416
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.380
model when you have politics defined by two parties.

417
00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:35.469
It's a very convenient model to allow the two

418
00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:38.329
parties to, uh, gain loyalty. Because if we go

419
00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:40.140
back to the way Lincoln did things and said,

420
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.020
hey, there's a bunch of issues and my party

421
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.099
stands for a whole bunch and, and you maybe

422
00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:45.579
agree with some of them, maybe don't agree with

423
00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:47.864
them. But I hope you'll vote Republican because you

424
00:18:47.875 --> 00:18:49.484
believe in holding the union together, even if you

425
00:18:49.494 --> 00:18:51.604
don't agree with me on tariffs, right? You know,

426
00:18:51.614 --> 00:18:53.135
that's the way Lincoln approached things and that was

427
00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:55.194
correct. We could go back to that but the

428
00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:58.714
parties don't want to because currently uh they can,

429
00:18:58.724 --> 00:19:00.905
they can say you have to support the party

430
00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:02.354
and you have to give it all your loyalty

431
00:19:02.364 --> 00:19:04.584
and all your energy and all your money because

432
00:19:04.594 --> 00:19:07.125
we stand on the left side of the spectrum

433
00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:09.640
and everything that is left wing is good. So

434
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.609
if you get a fundraising letter from the Democratic

435
00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:14.060
Party that says Ricardo, please donate to the Democrats.

436
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.619
We stand uh we stand against the forces of

437
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.160
right wing fascism, please be a progressive advance the

438
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.569
cause of social justice and donate today. You're more

439
00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:23.300
likely to get out your wallet and donate, right?

440
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.199
Fighting for justice, who, who, who's against that, fighting

441
00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:27.900
against the forces on the other side, on the

442
00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.260
extreme, right of the political spectrum like this is

443
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.859
very emotional, it's, it's very um catalyzing. But if

444
00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:35.630
they told you the truth and said, Ricardo, our

445
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.760
party stands for a bunch of positions. They're not

446
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.589
related to each other. It's just a grab bag.

447
00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:42.569
It's just AAA basket of issues. We hope you

448
00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:44.310
agree with enough of them to donate. You're less

449
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.869
likely to get out your wallet. You're less likely

450
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.750
to go door to door, you're less likely to,

451
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.680
uh, to crusade for the cause, so to speak.

452
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.930
So II I think, you know, there are powerful

453
00:19:53.939 --> 00:19:55.989
incentives to perpetuate the myth of left and right

454
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.530
out there. And that's why, you know, I'm glad

455
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.829
there's voices like you crying in the wilderness. And

456
00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:01.060
it seems like people who have grown up in

457
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:04.369
other countries for what uh it seems like, you

458
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.260
know, you have to tell me if this is

459
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.920
correct, sorry to be interviewing you a little bit

460
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.780
here. But I'm guessing, you know, you came from

461
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.739
Brazil, you come to a different country and you

462
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.140
see that the political alignments are different. And so

463
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.719
you don't buy into the myth of left and

464
00:20:16.729 --> 00:20:18.949
right as much because you see that the correlations

465
00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:21.130
that exist here didn't necessarily exist in your country.

466
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.550
And therefore you get a sense that they're not

467
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.660
natural. And that's why foreigners have a much more

468
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.489
objective perspective on American politics because they see outside

469
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.810
this left, right stricture. Does that, does that sound

470
00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:30.510
correct to you?

471
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.795
Yes. Yes. And I mean, here in Portugal, we

472
00:20:33.805 --> 00:20:37.104
have many, many, many more than 20, I'm sorry.

473
00:20:37.824 --> 00:20:41.094
Yeah. No, no worries. No worries. We have more

474
00:20:41.104 --> 00:20:44.064
than two political parties. Of course, there are, there

475
00:20:44.074 --> 00:20:46.415
are two of them that are the biggest ones

476
00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:51.234
but, uh, this, the extreme right grew just in

477
00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:55.910
these recent, uh, national general elections and we have

478
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.510
many other, more minor political parties. But, yeah, it's

479
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.599
not at all, just a two party political system.

480
00:21:03.609 --> 00:21:06.829
So we, that, that idea that's very common in

481
00:21:06.839 --> 00:21:10.150
America that we just have the Democrats or the

482
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.510
Republicans and the rest, I mean, that they might

483
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.680
be there, but they are never going to win

484
00:21:15.689 --> 00:21:18.482
any elections. That's just for the woods.

485
00:21:19.192 --> 00:21:21.151
Yeah. And, and I'm guessing that what is considered

486
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.491
right wing in your country is going to be

487
00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:26.271
different than what's considered right wing here. So, so

488
00:21:26.281 --> 00:21:28.552
it, it shows the contingency of the spectrum and

489
00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:30.322
why it's so useless to use it because it

490
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:33.411
won't tell you cross cultural and cross contextual comparisons.

491
00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:34.832
I mean, you constantly, I'm sure it happens in

492
00:21:34.842 --> 00:21:36.962
your country too where if somebody is considered right

493
00:21:36.972 --> 00:21:38.952
wing, they say, oh, you're just like Hitler. Well,

494
00:21:38.962 --> 00:21:40.641
my goodness here in America, I mean, Hitler was

495
00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:43.021
a militarist and yet currently the Republican Party is

496
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:45.193
left militarist than the Democrats and yet they're considered

497
00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:48.354
extreme right wing. Uh Hitler was a socialist and

498
00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:51.394
yet the Republicans are considered currently less socialist than

499
00:21:51.404 --> 00:21:53.913
Democrats and they're considered right wing. So it just,

500
00:21:53.923 --> 00:21:57.193
it, it doesn't help anything to lump people or,

501
00:21:57.203 --> 00:21:58.953
or to place people on a spectrum along with

502
00:21:58.963 --> 00:22:01.453
Hitler and Stalin when there are so many different

503
00:22:01.463 --> 00:22:03.364
issues and so many different ways to bundle them.

504
00:22:03.443 --> 00:22:05.663
And your country of Portugal is proof of that.

505
00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:07.354
Uh WHAT is considered right wing in your country.

506
00:22:07.364 --> 00:22:09.416
Your bundle is going to be different than the

507
00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:11.855
American bundle will be different than the Chinese bundle

508
00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:13.745
will be different than the Australian bundle and on

509
00:22:13.755 --> 00:22:16.135
and on and on. And therefore pretending that there's

510
00:22:16.145 --> 00:22:18.666
only two bundles you can see through that illusion

511
00:22:18.676 --> 00:22:20.735
better than my fellow Americans. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

512
00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:21.135
afraid.

513
00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.546
000 yeah. And you're completely right about another point

514
00:22:24.556 --> 00:22:27.735
that is even within the European Union, if you

515
00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:31.975
compare across different countries, uh what you consider, right?

516
00:22:31.985 --> 00:22:35.777
For example, in Germany is different from what you

517
00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:38.517
see right here in Portugal and across the other

518
00:22:38.527 --> 00:22:40.878
countries. It's more or less the same. I mean,

519
00:22:40.887 --> 00:22:46.137
there are uh common uh areas, common issues that

520
00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:49.328
people care about and that people classify as being

521
00:22:49.338 --> 00:22:52.637
right wing or left wing or center or wherever.

522
00:22:52.647 --> 00:22:55.937
But yeah, there there is the difference, there's definitely

523
00:22:55.947 --> 00:22:59.277
differences across the countries here,

524
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.239
which which I think we think makes our point,

525
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.719
right? Because the social context is different in the

526
00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:07.770
different countries. And so the the the different positions

527
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.040
will be bundled differently depending on the social. Whereas

528
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.859
if the, again, this is a prediction, the social

529
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:15.170
theory makes that different contexts will have different bundles.

530
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.760
Whereas the essentialist theory says, no, no, no, this

531
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.290
set of positions go together because they're anti change.

532
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.829
And therefore wherever you are anti change, they should

533
00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:24.619
go together in the same way. But since they

534
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.569
don't go together in the same way, again, this

535
00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:28.979
is evidence against the essentialist theory and yet in

536
00:23:28.989 --> 00:23:30.189
favor of the social theory.

537
00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:32.699
Uh I mean, just to give you a quick

538
00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:35.609
example, I mean, just two examples there in the

539
00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:39.430
US, for example, there are people politically that are

540
00:23:39.449 --> 00:23:41.380
uh I mean, I'm not so sure. Uh uh

541
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.680
NOT so sure right now, but at least up

542
00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:47.920
until recently you had people there that were climate

543
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.744
change deniers, right? Even politicians and so on here

544
00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:56.435
in Portugal that virtually does not exist anymore, neither

545
00:23:56.444 --> 00:23:59.354
the right nor the left. And for example, here

546
00:23:59.364 --> 00:24:03.555
in Portugal, if someone was talking about just ending

547
00:24:03.564 --> 00:24:08.015
universal health care, they would immediately be labeled extreme,

548
00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:10.224
right? But immediately so.

549
00:24:10.685 --> 00:24:15.300
Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, so the, the, yeah, sure.

550
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.069
The um range of opinions gonna differ co country

551
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:19.599
to country as well. Mhm.

552
00:24:19.609 --> 00:24:22.819
Uh By the way, talking about the range of

553
00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:26.119
opinions or, I mean, the issues of contention, what

554
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.650
would you say are perhaps and since we're focusing

555
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.199
on America, the main issues of contention between the

556
00:24:33.209 --> 00:24:37.239
left and the right, or sometimes people refer to

557
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.369
the liberals and the conservatives, I mean, what are

558
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.800
the sorts of issues that people tend to associate

559
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.239
with each side of the political spectrum.

560
00:24:47.699 --> 00:24:51.530
Hm. Well, it's always changing. Um, CURRENTLY it seems

561
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.719
like the big issue is one of the big

562
00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:57.670
issues is immigration, right? So, uh Democrats, uh the,

563
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.930
the tribe left is generally more in favor of

564
00:24:59.939 --> 00:25:03.680
open immigration. And uh Republicans, the tribe, right, are

565
00:25:03.689 --> 00:25:07.140
generally considered uh more restrictive on immigration. So that's

566
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.339
a big one. Now again, if the, if the,

567
00:25:09.349 --> 00:25:11.099
if the essentialist theory was true, you would see

568
00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:13.505
this across time and space, right wing would have

569
00:25:13.515 --> 00:25:15.555
always been against immigration. But it's simply not true.

570
00:25:15.564 --> 00:25:18.324
Left wing heroes like Hugo Chavez were against open

571
00:25:18.334 --> 00:25:21.734
immigration. They understood correctly that open immigration drives down

572
00:25:21.744 --> 00:25:24.324
the wages of the working class. Now that maybe

573
00:25:24.334 --> 00:25:25.885
is, is uh you know, in the name of

574
00:25:25.895 --> 00:25:29.594
humanitarianism, uh maybe it's a, it's a on net

575
00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:31.905
positive thing for humanity. These are good debates to

576
00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:34.155
have. But I don't know any economist that says

577
00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:36.244
when the supply of something goes up, uh the

578
00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:38.800
price of it goes up too, right? I mean,

579
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.390
the price goes down when the supply goes up

580
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.050
and the supply of labor goes up, price goes

581
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.099
down. So, so this used to be considered a

582
00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.239
working class issue. The Democrats used to be the

583
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.510
party of the working class. Therefore, the Democrats used

584
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.130
to be more in favor of restricting immigration and

585
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.430
immigration restriction was considered more left wing. Now that's

586
00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:56.810
reversed because the coalitions have reversed. Why have the

587
00:25:56.819 --> 00:26:00.349
coalition's reversed? Again, it's electoral expediency. Who are the

588
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.390
immigrants voting for the immigrants vote overwhelmingly for Democrats?

589
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.469
Well, not overwhelmingly but slightly or at least the

590
00:26:05.479 --> 00:26:07.869
Children of immigrants do when they can vote if

591
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.189
you see. And this again, this is a prediction

592
00:26:10.199 --> 00:26:12.079
that our theory makes. We'll see if this happens.

593
00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:14.849
I'm quite sure it will that if immigrants and

594
00:26:14.859 --> 00:26:18.380
the Children of immigrants start voting Republican, you will

595
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.109
see Democrats start to uh oppose immigration. And Republicans

596
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:25.829
will be more in favor of open immigration. And

597
00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:27.670
what you will see is people won't say the

598
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.349
Democrats have moved to the right. Instead, they will

599
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:34.520
just reclassify what's considered left wing and they will

600
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.170
create a new story to encompass the new position.

601
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.520
They'll say, well, the left wing is in favor

602
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.949
of social justice and change towards social justice and

603
00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:47.270
restricting immigration helps promote economic equality, which it does

604
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.449
they are correct. So why is it currently not

605
00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:52.479
considered a matter of social justice? Because you can

606
00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:55.329
spin a social justice story for open immigration too.

607
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.010
So less immigration, you can create a concoct the

608
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.079
social justice story, more immigration, you can concoct the

609
00:27:01.089 --> 00:27:04.400
social justice story. The story remains the same even

610
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.250
as the issues change. And that's why we say

611
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.160
it's like astrology, the astrologer will tell the same

612
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:13.020
story for different things, right? So one Leo goes

613
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.260
into the office, somebody born in August goes into

614
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.589
the Astro's office and says hi there. I was

615
00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:20.010
born in August. Oh, she'll say you're a Leo.

616
00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.959
That means you're very brave. Really? And she'll say,

617
00:27:22.969 --> 00:27:24.099
yeah, tell me about your life. Well, I, I

618
00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:26.709
served in the military. Ah, you're brave. How brave

619
00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:27.699
of you to put your life in your life

620
00:27:27.709 --> 00:27:30.369
for the country. Great. Well, another Leo comes into

621
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.699
the office. Yeah, I was born in August. You're

622
00:27:31.709 --> 00:27:33.520
a Leo, it means you're brave. Really? She'll say,

623
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.939
yeah. Do you serve in the military? No, I

624
00:27:34.949 --> 00:27:37.935
didn't. How brave of you to stand up against

625
00:27:37.944 --> 00:27:40.775
your country's unjust military policies. That's what brave people

626
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.594
do. So it's heads I win tells you the

627
00:27:42.604 --> 00:27:45.305
storytelling. There is nothing that can falsify it as

628
00:27:45.314 --> 00:27:48.285
with astrology, they will find every way to look

629
00:27:48.295 --> 00:27:51.005
at all evidence as confirmation of the theory and

630
00:27:51.015 --> 00:27:54.814
nothing is discon confirmation. So just the point being

631
00:27:55.344 --> 00:27:58.094
same thing. So, so these issues that we consider

632
00:27:58.104 --> 00:28:02.270
so contentious um are actually um uh are actually

633
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.349
very contingent. It's not the Republicans moving to the

634
00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:06.400
right or the Democrats moving to the left. So

635
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.839
there are some contentious issues. However, the big misperception

636
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:13.160
and again, the misconception of a political spectrum creates

637
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.420
the misperception is that the republicans have moved to

638
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.869
the right Democrats move to the left and that's

639
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.410
why we hate each other and it's simply not

640
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.930
true. There is no left or right to move

641
00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:23.459
to as I think we ab demonstrate abundantly clear

642
00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:25.469
there isn't just one issue, there's many different issues.

643
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.599
And furthermore, the Democrats and Republicans are way closer

644
00:28:28.609 --> 00:28:30.780
than they used to be on many issues. Um

645
00:28:30.869 --> 00:28:32.834
You know, I mean, for instance, gay marriage, there

646
00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:35.035
is a consensus in favor of gay marriage among

647
00:28:35.045 --> 00:28:37.635
both Republicans and Democrats. If the Republicans have moved

648
00:28:37.645 --> 00:28:39.314
so far to the right, which is the typical

649
00:28:39.324 --> 00:28:42.354
narrative today, then why are they far, far, far

650
00:28:42.364 --> 00:28:43.795
more in favor of gay marriage than they were

651
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:45.755
10 or 15 years ago? That doesn't look like

652
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:47.694
a right word movement to me. And somebody will

653
00:28:47.704 --> 00:28:51.020
say, well, that's just gay marriage. Exactly. There's many,

654
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.199
many, many issues in politics and instead of talking,

655
00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:54.770
pretending it's just one and saying they've moved to

656
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.099
the right, you have to specify in what ways

657
00:28:57.109 --> 00:28:59.979
each party has become more extreme. But pretending there's

658
00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.079
just one issue and saying the Republicans have moved

659
00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:04.079
to the right and the Democrats to the left,

660
00:29:04.089 --> 00:29:06.790
it understates the vast amount of agreement there is

661
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.930
in this country, there's tons of agreement among the

662
00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:11.630
American populace. If you, if you pull the public

663
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.810
and ask them what they want to do about

664
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:16.689
immigration, they say they want to stop illegal immigration

665
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.849
and bit more high skilled immigrants. There's vast agreement

666
00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:22.109
on that. It's not that we Americans have polarized

667
00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:23.959
and some people hate immigration and some people want

668
00:29:23.969 --> 00:29:26.969
open borders and there's no middle there. It's simply

669
00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:29.390
not true. The vast majority of Americans take a

670
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.189
moderate position on immigration, but you wouldn't know it

671
00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:34.439
because of this myth of left and right, which

672
00:29:34.449 --> 00:29:36.630
pretends that there's just one issue and we've coalesced

673
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.810
at the polls. So what's really going on if

674
00:29:38.819 --> 00:29:41.760
we aren't becoming more extreme in our views isn't

675
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.099
true? Then, then, then what is all the hatred

676
00:29:44.109 --> 00:29:47.819
about? It's what it's what political scientists call affective

677
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:51.560
polarization, it means hatred, independent of the underlying substance.

678
00:29:51.569 --> 00:29:55.069
So there is increased affective polarization. But our contention

679
00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:57.119
is that what's driving a great deal of that

680
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.400
affective polarization is the myth of left and right.

681
00:29:59.609 --> 00:30:02.040
When you conceive of politics in terms of one

682
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.660
issue, and you believe that everyone that anyone who

683
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.750
disagrees with you on anything is your enemy because

684
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.119
they're on the right side of the spectrum and

685
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.099
therefore an extremist, of course, you're gonna hate them.

686
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:12.280
But if you give up the nonsense that there's

687
00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.420
just one an issue and you say, you know,

688
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.880
there's a whole bunch of issues and everybody's gonna

689
00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.430
have a different bundle. Somebody might be in favor

690
00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:20.689
of uh in favor of gay marriage and be

691
00:30:20.699 --> 00:30:23.650
in favor of more aggressive action on climate change

692
00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.900
and more in favor of deregulating the economy and

693
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.150
more in favor of lower taxes, right? They're gonna

694
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.650
have a whole distinctive bundle of issues. And if

695
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.510
you look at individual issues and look at individual

696
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.239
people as holding an individual bundle of issues, then

697
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.540
you don't place them on a spectrum and say,

698
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.000
well, you're my enemy because you're on the extreme,

699
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.130
right? Or something like that. Instead you say, you

700
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.270
know what Ricardo holds a set of positions, I

701
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.589
hold a set of positions. Ricardo and Hiram are

702
00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.770
going to agree on some things and disagree with,

703
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.560
on, on others. That's OK. That means that Ricardo

704
00:30:50.569 --> 00:30:52.479
is at least in some things my ally, I

705
00:30:52.489 --> 00:30:53.630
don't have to put him on a line and

706
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.060
pretend he's the enemy because he's not. He agrees

707
00:30:56.069 --> 00:30:57.510
with me on some things. Now, Ricardo, I don't

708
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.709
know you that well. So I don't even know

709
00:30:58.719 --> 00:31:00.359
what those things are, but I guarantee you, you

710
00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:02.160
and I agree on a lot of things and

711
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.209
putting you on a spectrum opposite the side of

712
00:31:04.219 --> 00:31:08.489
me would, would create hostility where none existed. And

713
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.989
so the relationship between Hiram and Ricardo right now

714
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.910
is I know for a fact we agree on

715
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.020
things. It's mathematically certain that we do and therefore

716
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.699
we have a point of agreement with which to

717
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:20.209
begin a dialogue. And if we disagree on things,

718
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:21.699
I know that Ricardo is a guy of good

719
00:31:21.709 --> 00:31:24.010
faith and any disagreement would be a good faith

720
00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.739
disagreement and we could discuss it in civil terms

721
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.270
that would be rendered, rendered impossible if I put

722
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.890
you on a spectrum and said you are one

723
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.060
of the wicked people because you're on the wrong

724
00:31:33.069 --> 00:31:36.260
side of the one big issue, affective polarization is

725
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.400
driven by the myth of Poll

726
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.030
a and on that point of polarization, uh it

727
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.770
is very important to, to really drive that uh

728
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.380
uh message or my guess, because isn't it the

729
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.329
case? I, I'm not sure if you would agree

730
00:31:51.339 --> 00:31:53.060
with me on this point or not, if not,

731
00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:55.219
please tell me. But isn't it the case that

732
00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:58.400
when it comes to polarization and even effective polarization

733
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:03.400
itself? It is just, I mean, the idea that

734
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.119
people love about it, how about how much of

735
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.750
a problem it really is, is sort of overblown

736
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.459
by what they see on social media and on

737
00:32:12.469 --> 00:32:16.130
the media more generally because, mm, what you get

738
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.310
on social media, almost 100% of the time, isn't

739
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:25.479
it mostly the most vocal, most, uh, politically motivated

740
00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:29.660
people and the ones that perhaps have, um, higher

741
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.709
stakes in politics and the ones that have an

742
00:32:32.719 --> 00:32:38.030
identity, uh constructed around poli politics and perhaps their

743
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.589
income also comes sometimes for, from generating, I mean,

744
00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:46.430
political content on the internet and elsewhere. Aren't those

745
00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:50.545
the people that really are producing the most extreme

746
00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:53.755
views and all the time claiming that the country

747
00:32:53.765 --> 00:32:57.484
is divided and people do not agree when anymore

748
00:32:57.494 --> 00:33:00.165
and people talk past each other and they can't

749
00:33:00.175 --> 00:33:03.744
really discuss issues anymore because when you go out

750
00:33:03.755 --> 00:33:07.324
on the street and talk with normal people, that's

751
00:33:07.334 --> 00:33:09.484
usually not what you get. Right.

752
00:33:09.829 --> 00:33:13.530
Oh, absolutely. I, 100% agree. Yeah, we can't emphasize

753
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.079
this strongly enough that the myth of left and

754
00:33:16.089 --> 00:33:19.069
right is largely an elite phenomenon. It's an elite

755
00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:21.329
phenomenon. It is much more likely to be held

756
00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:27.290
by politicians, um uh college professors, uh uh media,

757
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.209
media people, right? These are the people that hold

758
00:33:29.219 --> 00:33:30.479
the myth of left and right, the people on

759
00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:31.810
the street. I mean, you, you just talk to

760
00:33:31.819 --> 00:33:34.496
a regular person and just talk to an average

761
00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:36.057
Joe going about their life, you know, going to

762
00:33:36.067 --> 00:33:37.837
their work at a software company or, or, or

763
00:33:37.847 --> 00:33:39.477
going to work on the line at the factory,

764
00:33:39.487 --> 00:33:42.077
just an average everyday person and you ask them,

765
00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:44.116
their politics, it's gonna be all over the place.

766
00:33:44.126 --> 00:33:46.876
It's not gonna fit a one size fits all.

767
00:33:46.886 --> 00:33:48.347
There's only one issue. And so I have to

768
00:33:48.357 --> 00:33:50.136
check all these boxes because I'm in favor of

769
00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:52.217
change or social justice. I mean, you know, you

770
00:33:52.227 --> 00:33:55.067
know, my brother, he's not into politics. Uh, NOT,

771
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:56.593
not the brother and the co-author with another one.

772
00:33:56.604 --> 00:33:58.543
He lives in Florida. Um, HE'S in favor of

773
00:33:58.553 --> 00:34:01.104
gay marriage, he's getting gay married. Uh, THIS year

774
00:34:01.114 --> 00:34:02.904
he's, uh in favor of less regulation of the

775
00:34:02.913 --> 00:34:06.384
economy. Um, HE'S also, um, has, you know, is

776
00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:08.783
more in favor of kind of environmental regulation and

777
00:34:08.793 --> 00:34:10.743
things like that. He's also in favor of uh

778
00:34:10.753 --> 00:34:13.603
tax cuts and so forth. He's just got this

779
00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:16.063
bundle of positions that doesn't fit him anywhere on

780
00:34:16.072 --> 00:34:18.371
a spectrum because he's not a police political elite.

781
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.130
He doesn't watch Fox News. He doesn't care. He

782
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:21.650
has a life, he's a good person that just,

783
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.250
you know, goes to work, does his business goes

784
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.031
home, lives a good, decent life. Like, like most

785
00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:29.091
of us strive to do and he's not caught

786
00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:30.851
up therefore in the myth of left and right.

787
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.591
So the, the, the standard explanation when we, when

788
00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:36.541
we talk about how these ideologies are incoherent and

789
00:34:36.551 --> 00:34:38.571
they think these things don't go together. The, the

790
00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:42.530
standard thing to say is um uh well, we

791
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.458
need this simple model for, for the masses, the

792
00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.260
elites we can see through it, we can see

793
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.550
more complex, we can talk one issue and you

794
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.560
know, each individual issue, we can go granular but,

795
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.800
but the dummies, the people without our IQ, they

796
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.610
need the simple model. They couldn't handle the complexity,

797
00:34:57.709 --> 00:35:00.100
they can't handle the truth, you know, Jack Nicholson

798
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.590
and a few good men. That's, that's the way

799
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.800
people, that's the way some of my colleagues respond.

800
00:35:03.889 --> 00:35:06.199
The reality is the exact opposite. It is the

801
00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:08.429
elites who need this thing. It is the elites

802
00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.120
who need the self justification and the sense of

803
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:14.392
self righteousness, the political spectrum rings the masses don't

804
00:35:14.402 --> 00:35:16.642
need the spectrum. They get along just fine any

805
00:35:16.652 --> 00:35:18.731
more than they get confused when they go to

806
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:20.531
the grocery store. Then I'll go to the grocery

807
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:21.991
store and say, oh my gosh, there's more than

808
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:25.102
two products. III I can't handle the complexity no,

809
00:35:25.112 --> 00:35:27.011
they go inside and they pick their, your peanut

810
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:28.691
butter and then they go get their tortillas and

811
00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:30.362
then they go get some apples and some baby

812
00:35:30.372 --> 00:35:32.552
carrots. They just, they just pick their own stuff.

813
00:35:32.562 --> 00:35:34.572
The idea that they get confused because there's more

814
00:35:34.582 --> 00:35:36.912
than two options is, is just absurd. And yet

815
00:35:36.922 --> 00:35:39.251
people continue to harp on this and say we

816
00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:41.533
have to have the political spectrum because people get

817
00:35:41.543 --> 00:35:44.164
confused. If we don't have a spectrum nonsense. There's

818
00:35:44.174 --> 00:35:47.543
just no evidence for that. We handle complexity very

819
00:35:47.553 --> 00:35:50.093
well as human beings. We go granular in every

820
00:35:50.104 --> 00:35:52.204
other domain of, of life. When it comes to

821
00:35:52.214 --> 00:35:54.033
getting dressed in the morning, we say, hey, I'm

822
00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:55.434
gonna wear this pair of pants and this tie

823
00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:57.434
and this shirt and this hat, I mean, whatever

824
00:35:57.444 --> 00:35:59.773
we, we are, we deal with that complexity every

825
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.243
day. We have more than two outfits and we

826
00:36:01.253 --> 00:36:03.384
just do, we do just fine when it comes

827
00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.864
to recreation. We don't say, are you on the

828
00:36:04.874 --> 00:36:06.704
recreational left or are you, are you on the

829
00:36:06.714 --> 00:36:08.716
recreational? Right? We don't, we do that. We don't

830
00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:11.236
pretend that there's only one kind of recreation. We

831
00:36:11.246 --> 00:36:13.656
say this guy likes skateboarding. That guy likes mountain

832
00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:15.565
climbing. This person likes to play board games. This

833
00:36:15.575 --> 00:36:17.055
person likes to play video game. We just, we

834
00:36:17.065 --> 00:36:19.295
just talk about what they like to do instead

835
00:36:19.305 --> 00:36:22.035
of pretending that there's only one thing. And so

836
00:36:22.045 --> 00:36:23.956
so we have to get away from this idea

837
00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:27.196
that, that, that the masses can't handle the complexity

838
00:36:27.206 --> 00:36:29.506
of the political spectrum is a tool is a

839
00:36:29.516 --> 00:36:31.166
sop that we throw to the masses who can't

840
00:36:31.176 --> 00:36:33.706
handle it because it's simply not true. It, all

841
00:36:33.716 --> 00:36:36.308
of the sociological data shows that the myth of

842
00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:38.978
left and right is much more pronounced among elites.

843
00:36:38.998 --> 00:36:40.958
The elites are the ones who cling to this

844
00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:42.708
model. They're the ones that need it because it

845
00:36:42.718 --> 00:36:45.778
flatters their egos and it riles up partisan support

846
00:36:45.788 --> 00:36:48.597
for their causes and it makes them, makes we

847
00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:49.708
can go on to this more if you want.

848
00:36:49.718 --> 00:36:51.687
But there are a lot of kind of self

849
00:36:51.697 --> 00:36:54.447
deception reasons why people want to believe them of

850
00:36:54.458 --> 00:36:56.837
left and right and why they get so angry

851
00:36:56.978 --> 00:36:59.357
when people like myself or David Sears at UCL,

852
00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:01.447
a point out that these ideologies are incoherent, it

853
00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:02.958
creates a lot of backlash.

854
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.550
Mhm uh And so I, is that what drives

855
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.770
these artificial division? I mean, is it uh people

856
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.290
who are basically commanding things politically that is it

857
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.659
because of their motivations that this sort of artificial

858
00:37:22.669 --> 00:37:24.429
division persists?

859
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.719
Well, um AAA bunch of reasons, um I mean,

860
00:37:29.729 --> 00:37:31.830
the main reason it persists is the human capacity

861
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.290
for self deception, which is pretty remarkable. See, so

862
00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.760
because we call our, our theory, the social theory

863
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.199
of ideology, right? And we say it's, it's about

864
00:37:40.209 --> 00:37:42.800
tribalism, people think it's about philosophy. I'm on the

865
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.719
left because I hold the progressive philosophy. I'm on

866
00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.969
the right because I hold the conservative philosophy, that's

867
00:37:46.979 --> 00:37:49.510
what they are telling themselves. But it's, it's not

868
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.040
true. It's, tribe, tribalism explains why these different things

869
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.260
do go together. Now, people look at what we're

870
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.000
saying and they say, oh, so you think people

871
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.790
shouldn't be tribal? We're not saying that it's impossible

872
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.370
not to be tribal. I don't know if you

873
00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.989
follow soccer or something. Uh, ARE you, are you

874
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.199
a football fan? I assume?

875
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.040
Yeah. Soccer. Yeah. Yeah.

876
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.780
Yeah. And so I'm, I'm guessing you have your

877
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.020
team, I'm not sure what it is, but I'm

878
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.350
guessing you're a hardcore committed to that team. I'm

879
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.550
not against that. You are tribal Ricardo and that's

880
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.649
fine. I am a tribal New York Jets fan,

881
00:38:17.189 --> 00:38:19.270
you know, II, I cheer for the Jets regardless

882
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.790
of what they do, regardless of who plays for

883
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.449
them. But I admit that's what I'm doing. And

884
00:38:23.459 --> 00:38:26.060
so the main reason the political spectrum persists is

885
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.540
because it gives us the illusion that we are

886
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.169
being philosophical. We are being tribal. It allows us

887
00:38:31.179 --> 00:38:35.030
to, to be tribal without feeling tribal. I mean,

888
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.239
I, if I were to go up to Senator

889
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.469
Elizabeth Warren today and say Senator Warren, you hold

890
00:38:39.479 --> 00:38:42.270
every single position that your party holds. I mean,

891
00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.110
there are 50 positions here and you check the

892
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.669
box on every single one of them. You're a

893
00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:50.320
tribal lemming, you can't think for yourself. You're just

894
00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.320
going along with the team. Now, that's obviously the

895
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.810
truth, you know it. And I know it and

896
00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.350
I'm guessing deep down she knows it, but she

897
00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.270
doesn't want to admit it to herself because it's

898
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.580
much funner for her to believe. No, no, no,

899
00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.330
I'm a progressive, I stand for the progressive philosophy

900
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.810
and all of these issues are just manifestations of

901
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.959
that one issue of progress. So there's one issue

902
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:12.189
in politics. You're either a progressive who believes in

903
00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:14.969
change for social justice or you are an evil

904
00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:17.679
right winger who wants to preserve and conserve privilege

905
00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:20.139
and stop change because you don't like social justice.

906
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.686
That is such a flattering way for Senator Warren

907
00:39:22.696 --> 00:39:23.595
to think and I don't mean to pick on

908
00:39:23.605 --> 00:39:25.345
her, I could pick on any Republican just as

909
00:39:25.355 --> 00:39:27.375
easily, right? They all, they all believe the same

910
00:39:27.385 --> 00:39:29.535
myth. They would, they would concoct the exact same

911
00:39:29.545 --> 00:39:31.446
story. So it's all of our politicians who claim

912
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.016
I'm a conservative, I'm a liberal. You know, there,

913
00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:35.936
it's a delusion. But how much better is that

914
00:39:35.946 --> 00:39:38.545
delusion than admitting the reality that you're just being

915
00:39:38.555 --> 00:39:40.926
a lemming, say that I just conform to my

916
00:39:40.936 --> 00:39:43.476
tribe. I can't think for myself. Uh Monkey, see

917
00:39:43.486 --> 00:39:45.625
monkey do. I, I can't think so. I, I

918
00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:47.516
don't want to think for myself and I want

919
00:39:47.525 --> 00:39:50.132
to feel right while I conform and I wanna

920
00:39:50.142 --> 00:39:52.402
embrace the entirety of the Democratic platform so that

921
00:39:52.412 --> 00:39:54.082
I can get, you know, hardcore support and, and

922
00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:56.001
run for president and be supported by my tribe.

923
00:39:56.191 --> 00:39:57.791
Uh And so I can't dissent from any of

924
00:39:57.802 --> 00:39:59.721
the things. But instead of admitting that you're just

925
00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:03.402
conforming, she's gonna tell herself this, this story, this

926
00:40:03.412 --> 00:40:07.142
very self flattering story of social justice progress. And

927
00:40:07.152 --> 00:40:09.291
that's why I adhere to the positions I do.

928
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:12.552
So, the main reason it persists is self deception.

929
00:40:12.562 --> 00:40:14.761
We humans are tribal and we all know that.

930
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.310
But what has come out in the psychology literature

931
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.850
in just the last 1020 years is the degree

932
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.010
to which we humans feel the need to disguise

933
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.879
our tribalism. The metaphor that Jonathan he used is

934
00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.909
the elephant and the rider, right? So you got

935
00:40:26.919 --> 00:40:28.629
this elephant and the elephant is going where it

936
00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:31.070
wants, you can't control the elephant. It's too big,

937
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.919
it's too powerful. It doesn't care where you want

938
00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:34.370
to go, it's gonna go where it wants to

939
00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:36.479
go. So here's the rider being carried along by

940
00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:38.389
the elephant. But then the rider gets to where

941
00:40:38.399 --> 00:40:39.879
the elephant wanted to go. And the writer tells

942
00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:41.840
himself a very uh fun story about, well, this

943
00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.179
is where I wanted to go all along and

944
00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:45.580
I was actually in control the whole time. This

945
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.745
story is flattering to the writer, but it's true.

946
00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:50.485
So he says that emotions are the elephant and

947
00:40:50.495 --> 00:40:52.215
reason is the writer and I don't think that's

948
00:40:52.225 --> 00:40:54.864
always true. I think we humans can be reasonable

949
00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:56.895
and by having better conceptual schemes, we can be

950
00:40:56.905 --> 00:40:59.314
more reasonable. But when it comes to the political

951
00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:02.364
spectrum, it is an irrational model. And the reason

952
00:41:02.375 --> 00:41:05.014
we adhere to that irrational model is because it

953
00:41:05.024 --> 00:41:07.895
flatters ourselves and, and it allows us to give

954
00:41:07.905 --> 00:41:11.034
to our tribal emotions without admitting that's what we're

955
00:41:11.044 --> 00:41:11.354
doing.

956
00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:14.239
I, I mean, but even with all of that

957
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.030
and all the self deception is it still baffles

958
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.169
me a little bit that people who are extremely

959
00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:24.879
politically motivated or that, I mean, identify themselves with

960
00:41:24.889 --> 00:41:28.750
a particular political party political movement or something like

961
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.699
that. I mean, how is it that they do

962
00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:35.360
not reps? At least, sometimes pause a little bit

963
00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.419
and think about themselves and look at the, uh,

964
00:41:38.669 --> 00:41:41.570
uh, at the beliefs that their political party e

965
00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.070
spouses and stuff like that and think, oh, my

966
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.699
God. I agree with 100 out of 100 of

967
00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:51.530
these political issues with them. I mean, what, what

968
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.040
are the chances that someone normal, uh, that, that

969
00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:59.189
would happen to someone normal? Right. I mean, don't

970
00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:01.780
you think that even with the self deception, perhaps

971
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.879
there are a few people out there, at least

972
00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:06.800
a few of them that notice this, but they

973
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:11.969
just can't afford to not go along with the

974
00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:13.060
party, let's say.

975
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.870
Yeah. Yeah. So you see this happen, right? Um,

976
00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:18.290
BECAUSE they see the consequences of it. So you,

977
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.250
you probably may have heard of Senator Jeff Flake,

978
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.429
I believe a senator from Arizona and he didn't

979
00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.030
like what the direction the party was going when

980
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.530
it nominated Donald Trump. And he didn't believe in

981
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.610
Trump's big government and he didn't believe in Trump's

982
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.030
uh crassness and his personal flaws. Uh AND, and

983
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.889
his, uh and his kind of disturbing nationalism. He

984
00:42:34.899 --> 00:42:37.649
didn't agree with these things. Now, what most people

985
00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:40.429
in the Republican Party did is they simply changed

986
00:42:40.439 --> 00:42:42.439
their views to fit what Trump was doing and

987
00:42:42.449 --> 00:42:44.179
then made up a story after the fact to

988
00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:47.100
say I'm being conservative, I'm consistent. Uh uh TH

989
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:50.090
this, this is all part of my conservative philosophy,

990
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.479
but you believe the opposite thing 10 years ago.

991
00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:54.669
Oh, what circumstances have a change? And the philosophy

992
00:42:54.679 --> 00:42:56.179
is being applied differently, right? They, they would go

993
00:42:56.189 --> 00:42:58.969
and deceive themselves. But somebody like Jeff Blake, he

994
00:42:58.979 --> 00:43:00.979
says, no, no, no, this, this goes against my

995
00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:02.860
deepest health convictions. I'm not going along with it.

996
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.560
But what happened to Jeff Flake, right? He gets

997
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.379
voted out of office. You have to if you're

998
00:43:06.389 --> 00:43:09.560
not one of the team. So, so principles are

999
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.820
not rewarded politically. If you hold faster principles and

1000
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.239
say I have beliefs and I believe these things

1001
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.699
out of a matter of conviction, then you're going

1002
00:43:18.709 --> 00:43:20.790
to not match up with the party on everything.

1003
00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:23.439
And as the party changes, you will find yourself

1004
00:43:23.459 --> 00:43:26.520
um not fitting in with the party. And so

1005
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.860
you have an incentive to perpetuate the method of

1006
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.100
left and right to pretend that everything no matter

1007
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.489
what it is and it could be anything but

1008
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.959
it all promotes conservatism or progressivism that allows you

1009
00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.780
to be tribal, it allows you to continue to

1010
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.000
go along with the tribe and, and, and, and,

1011
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.469
and be in lockstep with them and therefore avoid

1012
00:43:44.479 --> 00:43:45.709
the kinds of things that have happened to Jeff

1013
00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:47.790
Flake or Tulsi Gabbard on the democratic side. Right.

1014
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.080
Dissent does not reward you. And since independent thinking

1015
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.560
and principle leads to dissent, you see, uh leads

1016
00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.800
to dissent and dissent then leads to um being

1017
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.679
ejected from positions of influence. That's why you see

1018
00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:05.040
less dissent ergo less independent thinking. And so the

1019
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:06.840
myth of left and right is, is just such

1020
00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.149
a, a wonderful tool to covers people peop to

1021
00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:13.850
cover people's tribal sins instead of admitting that's what

1022
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.469
they're doing. Concocting stories is a, is a much

1023
00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:18.840
uh is a much more self flattering route to

1024
00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:19.199
go.

1025
00:44:20.419 --> 00:44:23.360
So I've, I've, I think we've already talked about

1026
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.790
some of the main consequences that this sort of

1027
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.479
thinking that people have about how politics works and

1028
00:44:30.489 --> 00:44:33.239
the myth, the myth of left and right, some

1029
00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.870
of the consequences that it has. Do you think

1030
00:44:35.879 --> 00:44:39.280
it's possible for us to move beyond the sort

1031
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.879
of essentialist view of ideology? And if so, how

1032
00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:44.760
can we do it?

1033
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.949
Yeah. So, um so yes, it is possible and,

1034
00:44:50.959 --> 00:44:52.850
and a couple of things help me know that

1035
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.189
one is just historical reality. We used to not

1036
00:44:56.199 --> 00:44:59.340
have a political spectrum. The same way that the

1037
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.800
four humors theory didn't exist, pe people invented it,

1038
00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.209
you know, at some point in time and then

1039
00:45:03.219 --> 00:45:05.280
it spread, it spread like a virus and it

1040
00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.270
did its terrible damage and then people woke up

1041
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.659
and moved beyond it. So if, if doctors could

1042
00:45:09.669 --> 00:45:11.439
get beyond the four humors theory, just by being

1043
00:45:11.449 --> 00:45:13.540
rational and saying, my goodness, look at all the

1044
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:16.620
people that are killing and then used scientific criteria

1045
00:45:16.629 --> 00:45:19.149
of falsification and saying what it, what would be

1046
00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:22.510
discon confirming evidence. And then seeing that discon confirming

1047
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.179
evidence in the theory, they were holding and being

1048
00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:26.280
willing to discard the theory by being rational and

1049
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.375
scientific. Well, sure, of course, we can get moved

1050
00:45:28.385 --> 00:45:30.314
beyond the myth of left and right too because

1051
00:45:30.324 --> 00:45:32.415
it's every bit as false as the four humorous

1052
00:45:32.425 --> 00:45:35.284
theory. Um So it, it came into existence and

1053
00:45:35.294 --> 00:45:37.294
since people used to not have it, well, there's

1054
00:45:37.304 --> 00:45:38.655
no reason we couldn't go back to the way

1055
00:45:38.665 --> 00:45:40.754
we were before. It's, there's no reason we couldn't

1056
00:45:40.764 --> 00:45:42.254
go back to the time of Andrew Jackson or

1057
00:45:42.264 --> 00:45:43.935
Thomas Jefferson or something when they didn't have this

1058
00:45:43.945 --> 00:45:47.485
delusion of, of a single issue in politics. OK.

1059
00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:51.155
So we know it's possible. Um Second, the reason

1060
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.544
what gives me hope when I get very despairing

1061
00:45:53.554 --> 00:45:55.074
because the myth of left and right is so

1062
00:45:55.084 --> 00:45:57.870
entrenched, what gives me hope is when I again,

1063
00:45:57.879 --> 00:46:00.030
the common people, I was talking about before, but

1064
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.189
especially young people, it seems like the older generation

1065
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:06.110
is very, um rigid and they have had this

1066
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.669
model their entire lives. They, they, they have gotten

1067
00:46:08.679 --> 00:46:11.729
their sense of political identity from this model and

1068
00:46:11.739 --> 00:46:13.379
they're very reluctant to surrender it. I mean, they

1069
00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:16.550
have an entire lifetime of investment in the identity

1070
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.229
of conservative or progressive and that lifetime of work

1071
00:46:20.239 --> 00:46:21.919
and the idea that you're, you know, 70 years

1072
00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:23.860
old and gonna say uh yeah, I've been wrong

1073
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.540
all these years. I'm I I shouldn't have been

1074
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:26.780
a progressive in the first place. My life was

1075
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.580
a way, you know, that is very hard for

1076
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.870
them to do, understandably. Not only because there's a

1077
00:46:30.879 --> 00:46:34.889
little less cognitive plasticity or neuroplasticity and cognitive flexibility

1078
00:46:34.899 --> 00:46:37.270
as you get older. Uh But also because of

1079
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.149
the sunk cost fallacy, right? You've invested in this

1080
00:46:39.159 --> 00:46:41.030
thing your whole life. But when I talk to

1081
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.919
younger people very hard because when I bring up

1082
00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:46.030
our theory, I get almost no pushback from young

1083
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.389
people. I even these so called, you know, campus

1084
00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:50.479
left wing radicals even then when I talk to

1085
00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:52.050
them, they, they say, yeah, that sounds right to

1086
00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.989
me, you know, uh they don't see things in,

1087
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.540
in uni dimensional terms. Uh So, so when you

1088
00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.209
talk to regular people who aren't invested in the

1089
00:47:00.219 --> 00:47:01.719
model, they see the wisdom in it, they see

1090
00:47:01.729 --> 00:47:04.020
the common sense in it and they buy into

1091
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.110
it. So there is some evidence that it's weakening.

1092
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.290
There is some evidence that younger generations don't look

1093
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.290
at politics in uni dimensional terms and that's very

1094
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.489
heartening. Now, the older generation doesn't understand this right

1095
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.330
to them. It's just this big puzzle. How is

1096
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.229
it that young people are, uh you know, in

1097
00:47:21.239 --> 00:47:23.909
favor of deregulation of the economy, but also in

1098
00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:25.929
favor of more aggressive action on climate change, what's

1099
00:47:25.939 --> 00:47:27.949
going on. They're supposed to be on the left.

1100
00:47:27.959 --> 00:47:30.570
What's happening? You have to stop thinking in terms

1101
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.540
of left and right. You have to start saying

1102
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.449
that climate change is one issue and regulation of

1103
00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:37.459
the economy is an entirely different issue. And there's

1104
00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:41.169
nothing like cognitively dissident or wrong with holding one

1105
00:47:41.179 --> 00:47:43.219
position on one and then another position or another

1106
00:47:43.229 --> 00:47:46.100
because they're two totally different issues. So, and this

1107
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.620
solves a lot of puzzles. I mean, I'm just

1108
00:47:47.629 --> 00:47:50.659
amazed at how many commentators just their head is

1109
00:47:50.669 --> 00:47:52.520
about to explode. I I don't get this what's

1110
00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.879
going on like, like when um the Koch brothers

1111
00:47:55.889 --> 00:47:57.840
partnered with George Soros to create an Institute for

1112
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.669
Peace and people's heads were exploding. How is this?

1113
00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:03.330
These Koch brothers who are on the far extreme,

1114
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.949
right? Are partnering with George Soros on the far

1115
00:48:05.959 --> 00:48:08.020
extreme left. What is going on? How are we

1116
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.540
to understand this? We have to come up with

1117
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.310
some kind of theory. No, you don't. It's really,

1118
00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.139
really simple. Here's how simple it is. There's this

1119
00:48:15.149 --> 00:48:17.580
thing called peace not left wing, not right wing,

1120
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.139
just peace. And the Koch brothers are in favor

1121
00:48:20.149 --> 00:48:21.840
of peace and George Soros is in favor of

1122
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.810
peace and they're fighting for a common cause. As

1123
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.590
soon as you stop trying to place these people

1124
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.250
on an imaginary line. It's amazing how quickly so

1125
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.600
many of our political puzzles resolve. There is no

1126
00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.260
puzzle. We have created false problems where problems don't

1127
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:36.290
exist. How can we solve the thing of the

1128
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.929
extreme left making common cause of extreme? There is

1129
00:48:38.939 --> 00:48:40.810
no left, there is no right. There's simply the

1130
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.729
question of, do you believe in more or less

1131
00:48:42.739 --> 00:48:45.570
peace, more or less military action to resolve international

1132
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.449
dilemmas? And both the Kochs and sorrows find themselves

1133
00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:50.169
on the same side of that one issue. And

1134
00:48:50.179 --> 00:48:51.290
once you look at it that way in a

1135
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.790
granular way, all of these puzzles that are making

1136
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.250
pundits head explode, just, just go away. It, it

1137
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.889
really is a simple model. It's a common sense

1138
00:48:59.899 --> 00:49:02.850
model and all of the supports it. So we're

1139
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.010
just talking not just in favor of rationality, but

1140
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.389
by God goodness, common sense people think, well, you're,

1141
00:49:08.399 --> 00:49:10.649
you're putting forward this theory that common people can't

1142
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:13.010
understand. Oh, give me a break. That's just silly.

1143
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.870
Again. That's more self flattering nonsense. The common people

1144
00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:17.649
get it just fine. It's actually the elites who

1145
00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:19.959
have the hardest time with this going up to

1146
00:49:19.969 --> 00:49:21.050
a person in the street and saying, you know

1147
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.620
what there's more than one issue in politics they

1148
00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:26.010
say. Yeah, of course. And, yeah, exactly. It's only

1149
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.850
the college professors who fight against this. No, no,

1150
00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.570
no. There has to be one, there has to

1151
00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.399
be just one issue. You're either in favor of

1152
00:49:31.409 --> 00:49:33.320
change in social justice or you're against these things.

1153
00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.899
And I'm on the side of social justice. The

1154
00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:37.290
college professor believes that because he wants to flatter

1155
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.050
himself that he's one of the good guys that

1156
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.745
all of his political positions which just happen to

1157
00:49:41.754 --> 00:49:44.294
align with everything the Democratic Party believes are all

1158
00:49:44.304 --> 00:49:46.324
fighting for the cause of social justice that is

1159
00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:49.135
so flattering to them. And so they're the ones

1160
00:49:49.145 --> 00:49:50.804
who believe it, not the person on the street.

1161
00:49:50.814 --> 00:49:54.235
So the power of the common people generally trumps

1162
00:49:54.245 --> 00:49:56.274
the power of elites in the long term. And

1163
00:49:56.284 --> 00:49:57.705
I think that's gonna happen here too

1164
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.750
great. So let's send on that hopeful note and

1165
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.689
the book is again the myth of left and

1166
00:50:04.699 --> 00:50:08.929
right how the political spectrum misleads and harms America.

1167
00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:11.129
I'm leaving a link to it in the description

1168
00:50:11.139 --> 00:50:13.810
of the interview. And apart from the book, would

1169
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.989
you like to tell people where they can find

1170
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.129
you and the rest of your work on the

1171
00:50:18.139 --> 00:50:18.689
internet?

1172
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.719
Oh yes, I am hiding on the internet. I'm

1173
00:50:21.729 --> 00:50:23.320
not on social media for the same reason. I'm

1174
00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.679
not on cocaine, but they're welcome to read the

1175
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.830
book. And uh I do respond to emails. So

1176
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.000
if they'd like to email me, I love to

1177
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:29.709
hear from people.

1178
00:50:30.149 --> 00:50:32.709
Great. So thank you so much again for taking

1179
00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:34.149
