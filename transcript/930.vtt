00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.950
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.730
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.689
joined by Doctor Rebecca Earl. She's a professor in

4
00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.970
the Department of History at the University of Warwick.

5
00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.130
She is a historian specializing in the history of

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.809
food and colonial and 19th century Spanish America. And

7
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.799
she's the author of books like Potato and Feeding

8
00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:25.840
The People, the Politics of the potato. And of

9
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.370
course, today we're talking about the history and politics

10
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.330
of the potato. So Doctor Earl, welcome to the

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.979
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.080
Thank you so much for inviting me.

13
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.709
So to introduce the topic. Tell us first a

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.560
little bit about the, let's say the origins of

15
00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.630
the potato. So where does it come from and

16
00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.909
when and where exactly these people start farming

17
00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:56.450
it? Well, potatoes originate in the Andes in South

18
00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:01.509
America and they the precise point of origin where

19
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.639
the very first potatoes were domesticated or cultivated or

20
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.730
eaten as a topic of some dispute between ethno

21
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.419
botanists and historical archaeologists. But for many, many thousands

22
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.900
of years, people all along the slopes of the

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.370
Andes have been subsisting off potatoes and actually the,

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.300
there's evidence that has been found relatively recently for

25
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.639
the consumption of wild potatoes as far north as

26
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.440
the United States, which um are on the same

27
00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:33.339
long mountain chain as the Andes. So the Andes

28
00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.040
that run all the way up from the south

29
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.069
of Chile through Peru through Colombia, continuing away up

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.269
into the Rockies. And so there's evidence even in

31
00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:45.279
the rocky mountains that a type of wild potato

32
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.760
was being eaten long before um writing began to

33
00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.569
keep track of these things. So they were very,

34
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.400
very ancient food stuff for people in those parts

35
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.879
of the world. But people outside those parts of

36
00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:58.489
the world, they were totally unknown and nobody else

37
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000
had ever encountered a potato.

38
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.250
So I would like to understand a little bit

39
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.610
better here. What are some of the biggest advantages

40
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.710
and disadvantages of potatoes as a crop? So, I

41
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.009
mean, how they compare, for example to other major

42
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.160
crops in terms of, for example, yields and providing

43
00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.289
people with nutrients and calories.

44
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.509
There are superfood stuff. They are really excellent. If

45
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.250
what you want to do is be get is

46
00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:32.679
get the most nutrients out of a set amount

47
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.759
of land. You'd be hard pushed to find something

48
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.850
better than a potato to cultivate. They're a really

49
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.630
great way of converting sunlight and soil into nourishment

50
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.020
for people. So they're a good, it's not, the

51
00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.990
potatoes are particularly high calorie, but they're high calorific

52
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.914
yield that out. A small plot of ground. You

53
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.195
can get many more calories than if you were

54
00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:56.294
growing wheat or rice or something like that. So

55
00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:59.934
they're a really efficient way of cultivating a smallish

56
00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:02.985
amount of ground. They're quite miserly in their use

57
00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:05.244
of water compared to lots of other crops. So

58
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:07.595
you don't need to inundate them with as much

59
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.869
water. They contain a large number of other nutrients

60
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.919
which again, they produce quite densely. So they're in

61
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.009
material, you know, from a material perspective, there are

62
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.820
really, really excellent food stuff. So they have lots

63
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.860
going for them from that point of view. And

64
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.679
they're, they're quite nutritious, particularly if you can combine

65
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.289
them with a bit of dairy, like a bit

66
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.970
of yogurt or a bit of milk or buttermilk,

67
00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.339
they make if not, maybe a complete meal, but

68
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.839
a really pretty well rounded nourishment

69
00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.000
and how adaptable are potatoes to different kinds of

70
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.199
environments. Because of course, people started farming them in

71
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.880
South America. But then, and we're going to get

72
00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.720
a little bit more into that. They spread across

73
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.679
Europe and other parts of the globe. But uh

74
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.740
and I would imagine here, of course, we're not

75
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.440
talking about one single type of potato, but basically

76
00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:04.494
how adaptable are they as a food source?

77
00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.985
Yeah, that's also a really good question. And so

78
00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:10.725
continuing, my enthusiastic promotion of potatoes is a really

79
00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:13.535
excellent food. Um I will say that potatoes are

80
00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:17.053
extremely adaptable and they're adaptable. I mean, not just

81
00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:21.613
because I guess they have a some botanical um

82
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.619
malleability which allows them to be adapted, but also

83
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.950
because people are very ingenious cultivators. And so we

84
00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.679
might talk later about who it was, who spread

85
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.119
potatoes all about the world and how it was

86
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.529
that potatoes traveled from the Andes to absolutely everywhere.

87
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.570
But because of the ingenuity of mostly small peasant

88
00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:45.329
farmers whose names have not been preserved by, by

89
00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.380
the historical record, people learn to adapt potatoes to

90
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.579
a wide range of different climates. So potatoes, as

91
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:56.040
you were just saying, come originally from, from the

92
00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:59.339
Andes and from a particular type of climatic um

93
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.420
environment, but they now grow in all kinds of

94
00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:04.769
different parts of the world. So India, for example,

95
00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.790
has become a leader in breeding potatoes that will

96
00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:11.089
grow in, in subtropical conditions. So we have potatoes

97
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.890
that grow almost anywhere that you might wish to

98
00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.040
grow them with maybe, you know, maybe some exceptions,

99
00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:19.070
but they're really very adaptable. Mhm.

100
00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.170
Uh So just before we get into how they

101
00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:27.589
started spreading across the globe. So uh going back

102
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.160
to South America, what was the status of potatoes

103
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.100
for South American people? I mean, they were they

104
00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.579
held in high regard because they were such a

105
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.630
good source of food, I guess or

106
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.315
not. Well, sort of yes and no. So I

107
00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:48.065
guess one needs to say by whom. So from

108
00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:50.364
the point of view of local communities, they were

109
00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.924
really important. And so we have lots of good

110
00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:57.785
evidence from European sources which started to write um

111
00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:02.214
records using alphabetic writing of what was going on

112
00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:04.904
in the Andes. Um These sources of sources start

113
00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:08.225
to appear in the 15 hundreds when Europeans invaded

114
00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:12.095
the Inca Empire and spread all around South America

115
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.779
um conquering and colonizing and also making notes and

116
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.630
records of what they were observing. And so we

117
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.059
have evidence from colonial sources, for example of rituals

118
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.019
and ceremonies to help protect potato crops and to

119
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.260
encourage potatoes to grow and to flourish that persisted

120
00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.100
after the arrival of, of Europeans, and which show

121
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:39.670
how very very important potatoes were to local communities.

122
00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:43.790
So there were potato goddesses, there were potato deities

123
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.149
who protected the crop and who you might try

124
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.420
to um to encourage to look after your potato

125
00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:53.989
field. So there would there would be ceremonies that

126
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.230
local villages would put on to mark the planting

127
00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:01.970
season to mark the harvest season, et cetera. So

128
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.940
they were really important and they were, they were

129
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.410
all kinds of ceremonial events to attempt to protect

130
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.549
these super important foodstuffs. So on the one hand,

131
00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:15.070
locally, very, very important and with a whole pantheon

132
00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:18.519
of, of religious deities who might help protect them

133
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.540
from the point of view of the Inca state,

134
00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:25.269
which was the the state that was governing much

135
00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.829
of, of Peru and parts of Bolivia and Ecuador

136
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:31.709
at the time that Europeans invaded in the 15

137
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.890
hundreds. From the point of view of this very

138
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:36.670
large uh empire, I guess we could call it

139
00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:42.160
of the Incas potatoes were not particularly um glamorous

140
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.369
or important. The foodstuffs that were seen as really

141
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.200
high status was, was maize really or you know,

142
00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.609
corn or sweet corn depending on what you want

143
00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:54.109
to call it. And that was, that was a

144
00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:58.720
crop that was closely linked to Inca state ritual.

145
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.190
And the, the ruler himself, the Inca would engage

146
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.559
in certain ceremonial events to mark the start of

147
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.160
the the harvests and or the cultivation season for

148
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.359
maize, for example. So maize was really important, maize.

149
00:08:13.369 --> 00:08:15.140
Why was it important? It was partly because it

150
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:17.980
was made into a really important beverage, a type

151
00:08:17.989 --> 00:08:22.359
of beer that had a, a sort of, well,

152
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:24.709
a a liturgical significance almost, I mean, a bit

153
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.350
like wine within Christian thinking, you know, wine isn't

154
00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:31.670
just a beverage. It also has a religious significance

155
00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:33.590
in the the mass. You know, it's part of

156
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.140
what becomes the body and blood of Jesus Christ.

157
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.719
And these this maze beer didn't have good exactly

158
00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.299
that same status, but it had a similarly important

159
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:47.640
religious and social status. And so maize was really

160
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.989
what? Potatoes, not so much, you know, potatoes were

161
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.440
kind of like an everyday crop. People eat them,

162
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.520
you don't need this big ritual. So they weren't

163
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.080
seen as so so fancy from the point of

164
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.549
view of the, the Inca State but they sustained

165
00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:03.369
the people and that was what most people would

166
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.400
have been consuming on a daily basis.

167
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.690
Mhm uh That's very interesting. And actually I've asked

168
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.000
you that question because later on, I want to

169
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.469
ask you another question about how during the enlightenment

170
00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:17.969
and mo in modern history, people particularly in Europe

171
00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:22.239
have been looking at the potato. I mean, philosophers

172
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.659
and politicians uh politically how people have been thinking

173
00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:32.090
about. But just before that, so uh Europeans basically

174
00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:37.700
invade uh South America. How do we know when

175
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.349
exactly did they first get in touch with this

176
00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:46.489
crop? The potato and how and when they brought

177
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.250
it to Europe?

178
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.809
Well, so food historians often like to play the

179
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.080
game of, of finding, you know, when is the

180
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.549
first written reference to a potato? When do we

181
00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.299
have the first evidence for this or that? And

182
00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:02.520
so the earliest evidence that we have from European

183
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:06.320
sources for the existence of potatoes dates from the

184
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.479
15 thirties. So we have some examples. We have

185
00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:12.299
some a couple of early examples from the 15

186
00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:15.809
thirties, from what's now Colombia, some from Peru and

187
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.729
Ecuador. So we have some descriptions. Europeans say things

188
00:10:19.739 --> 00:10:22.119
like, oh the people in this part, this part

189
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.159
of, of the world, they eat a, a sort

190
00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:27.239
of a root, they eat a kind of root

191
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.179
a bit like a truffle or a bit like

192
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.940
it tastes a bit like a chestnut and this

193
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.570
is their bread this is what they eat. So

194
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.369
we have these European descriptions from the early 15

195
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.500
hundreds who it was who first took the potato

196
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.369
back to Europe is, is, um, that's lost to

197
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.780
history. There is um, in Britain where, where I,

198
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:52.140
where I live, there's um, a certain kind of

199
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.539
mythology around the idea that either Sir Francis Drake

200
00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:59.299
or maybe Sir Walter Raleigh brought the potato back

201
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:04.760
to Europe and there's stories about, um Raleigh cultivating

202
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.520
the first potato, which I think is, I mean,

203
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.229
almost certainly totally incorrect because he didn't go anywhere

204
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:14.280
near really where uh potatoes originated before European, before

205
00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:16.820
Spaniards did. So Spaniards would have had the chance

206
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.719
to bring them back much earlier and it would

207
00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:23.549
have been Spaniards who had the opportunity to both

208
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.340
encounter potatoes and then take them back to Europe.

209
00:11:27.349 --> 00:11:29.659
I think it was sailors. I think it was

210
00:11:29.669 --> 00:11:33.510
um people, ordinary people bringing, who brought back all

211
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.010
kinds of different foodstuffs with them and who spread

212
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.659
all sorts of different things. So we know that

213
00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:41.940
there were sweet potatoes, for example, growing on the

214
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.890
southern coast of Spain by the end of the,

215
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.969
the 15 hundreds. And we have evidence of potatoes

216
00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:52.570
being sold in markets in Madrid in the um

217
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.900
turn of the from the 15 hundreds to the

218
00:11:54.909 --> 00:11:57.739
16 hundreds, for example, but who it was, who

219
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.770
brought all these back. Those were usually things that

220
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.780
were considered so unimportant that no historian at the

221
00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.359
time thought it worth recording.

222
00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:10.369
And how long exactly did it take for Europeans

223
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.340
to include potatoes in their diet? Because, you know,

224
00:12:14.349 --> 00:12:18.059
it was a new food and sometimes people are

225
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.250
a little bit reticent when it comes to including

226
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:25.549
new foods in their diet. So, but actually did

227
00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:27.419
it take longer or not?

228
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.890
Well, that, so the fact that as in the

229
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.489
early 16 hundreds, as I was just saying, there

230
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.969
were um market sellers in Madrid who were selling

231
00:12:35.979 --> 00:12:39.630
potatoes for people to buy starts to hint at

232
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.080
the fact that actually people weren't so suspicious of

233
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.849
these foods. There's an old story about how potatoes

234
00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:49.919
spread around Europe, which um I, I think it's

235
00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:51.890
completely wrong. One of the things I wanted to

236
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.119
show when I started researching into the history of

237
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.619
potatoes was how this story couldn't be right because

238
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.479
it really got up my nose. This story, it

239
00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.700
seemed to me it was just completely wrong. So

240
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.780
the old story goes something like this. Um The

241
00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:08.549
old story says when potatoes first reached Europe in

242
00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:12.030
the 15 hundreds and the 16 hundreds Europeans in

243
00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:14.500
general turned up their noses at the this food

244
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.260
stuff because it was unfamiliar. It was different. It

245
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.210
grew in the ground from tubers, not from seeds,

246
00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:25.200
it wasn't mentioned in the Bible. So probably it

247
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.409
was, you know, not a food approved of by

248
00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:29.840
God. It was sort of knobbly and lumpy and

249
00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:32.679
looked peculiar and people were afraid of it. And

250
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.469
it was only in the 17 hundreds during the

251
00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:41.710
enlightenment that Europeans began to eat potatoes. Why? Because

252
00:13:41.719 --> 00:13:47.890
far sighted intelligent enlightened aristocrats and public spirited philosophers

253
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.650
began to realize that the potato was a really

254
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:53.299
great food and that it might end hunger. And

255
00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:57.099
they started encouraging ordinary people to eat potatoes. And

256
00:13:57.109 --> 00:13:59.609
at that point, the ordinary people who had been

257
00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:01.969
refusing to eat potatoes because they weren't mentioned in

258
00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:05.659
the Bible said, oh, if Frederick the great tells

259
00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:07.969
us to eat them, then we'll definitely eat this.

260
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.520
And the rest is history, right? That's the kind

261
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.260
of standard story of how the potatoes, but it's

262
00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:15.390
just nuts. I mean, this is not how anybody

263
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.599
behaves. And anyway, most of the foods that were

264
00:14:17.609 --> 00:14:20.520
mentioned that, you know, that are, that were eaten

265
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.419
in early modern Europe aren't mentioned in the Bible.

266
00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.359
You know, the Bible doesn't have long lists of

267
00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:27.960
foods and that wasn't stopping people from eating a

268
00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:31.150
lot of these other foods. So this idea of,

269
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.119
you know, people being hopelessly conservative and only eating

270
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.599
foods that their great, great ancestors had had eaten.

271
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:40.400
That just didn't make sense to me. And I

272
00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:42.710
was also thinking, well, who was going to be

273
00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:49.020
doing the horticultural adaptation to allow potatoes to grow

274
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.859
in these slightly different European climates? The very question

275
00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:54.710
you were asking a moment ago, I was thinking,

276
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:58.380
who would be doing that? It's actually peasant farmers,

277
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.729
they're the ones who know how to adapt plants

278
00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:03.349
and how to cultivate them in slightly different soils.

279
00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:07.440
So I started looking for evidence who was cultivating

280
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:12.750
potatoes in early modern Europe. And the earliest examples

281
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.130
that I found tended to be referring to the

282
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.469
fact that they were being grown by small farmers.

283
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.690
So scientists would write about this, you know, botanists

284
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.710
and people who studied plants. They were the ones

285
00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:27.630
who were writing down the information about potatoes because

286
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.250
they were the ones who were writing down anything,

287
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.700
right. But what they often were writing down was

288
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.659
to say, oh, plants seem to be being widely

289
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:37.969
cultivated in certain parts of Germany now, or these

290
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.849
plants are being grown in Northern Italy by small

291
00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:45.679
farmers. So I would say that they spread much

292
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.890
more quickly than people have giving them credit for

293
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.659
doing. And there are reasons that we could talk

294
00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:53.789
about for why that might have been the case.

295
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.119
And that ordinary people far from being, you know,

296
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.390
conservative troglodytes were actually very happy to eat new

297
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.200
foods we have and we'll set up in a

298
00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:05.200
minute, but we have lots of evidence from, from

299
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.789
other foods from the Americas maize, for example, another,

300
00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:13.210
you know, peculiar food unknown to Europeans. It was

301
00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:15.969
being grown in the area around Venice by the

302
00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:18.309
mid 15 hundreds. And people used it to make

303
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.859
a new kind of polenta, a food that we

304
00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:24.969
often associate with Venice. Now we think of polenta

305
00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:28.789
being a kind of corn meal mush. Right before,

306
00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:32.229
before maize arrived, in Europe, people were making polenta,

307
00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:34.950
they were making them out of millet and other

308
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.659
grains. They were making sort of stodgy, starchy porridge

309
00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:41.789
is out of other grains. When maize arrived, people

310
00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:45.390
started making their polenta out of maize. And now

311
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.140
it's the most typical dish from, from the Veneto.

312
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.390
But again, it was peasant farmers who were doing

313
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.179
this, they were the ones who were eating these

314
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.270
starchy mushes. So people were generally quite interested in

315
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.289
new foods if they grew well, if they um

316
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.190
were calorific or if they were nourishing, if they

317
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.199
would have put it at the time and their

318
00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:07.150
other, they had other advantages as well.

319
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.079
So in your book, Feeding The People at a

320
00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.829
certain point, you talk about how particularly in the

321
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.530
early modern era and around the time of the

322
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.489
enlightenment uh instead of the state just caring about

323
00:17:25.499 --> 00:17:29.649
people having enough twe and the political consequences of

324
00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:34.438
famine. For example, there was sort of a transformation

325
00:17:34.448 --> 00:17:39.109
in the political significance of everyday eating habits. Uh

326
00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:41.389
So could you tell us a little bit about

327
00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:44.448
that and how that relates uh at a certain

328
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.348
point to the potato?

329
00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:50.810
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Uh The, so there was

330
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.339
a big change in the 17 hundreds in Europe

331
00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:59.380
about how political thinkers conceptualized what it meant to

332
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.869
govern. Well, so this was a topic, how you

333
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.239
governed well, was a topic that had been of

334
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.400
interest to people who wrote about political theory for

335
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.079
some time. So listeners might be familiar with people

336
00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:16.030
like Machiavelli who wrote advice about how to govern.

337
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.469
There were people like Hobbs who wrote books with,

338
00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:21.819
we wrote a book called Leviathan, that was a

339
00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:25.030
sort of analysis of the state. So there were

340
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.599
people who were beginning to write accounts of what

341
00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:31.520
it meant to govern properly and how you should

342
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.630
do that. So this was a sort of new

343
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.969
genre that was emerging. But over the course of

344
00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:42.339
the, the 17 hundreds ideas about what it in

345
00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:46.640
fact did mean to govern properly began to devote

346
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.010
more and more attention to the importance of having

347
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.760
a hearty, healthy robust population. This was something that

348
00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:00.800
became increasingly of interest to political theorists and there

349
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.880
was increasing attention to what it was you needed

350
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.000
to do to make sure that your population was

351
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:12.489
not only large but also robust. So, I mean,

352
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.910
this was in the, you know, I mean, nowadays,

353
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.050
we might think, oh, too big a population could

354
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.530
be a problem. Maybe your population will be bigger

355
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.479
than the food supply. That that was an idea

356
00:19:23.489 --> 00:19:26.270
that emerged really only at the end of the

357
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.060
17 hundreds. And it was a totally new idea

358
00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:31.329
really at the time for much of the, the

359
00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:35.300
18th century, the absolute consensus was the more the

360
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.560
bigger your population, the more powerful your state, you

361
00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:42.390
if you had more people than in the neighboring

362
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.479
country, you had more people to be in the

363
00:19:44.489 --> 00:19:46.160
army. You had more people to be in the

364
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.199
navy. You had more people to work in agriculture.

365
00:19:49.209 --> 00:19:51.439
You had more people to work in the emergent

366
00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:54.800
industries. You know, you would be more powerful provided

367
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.329
those people were healthy, right? You needed, you didn't

368
00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:59.939
want a population of sickly layabouts. You wanted a

369
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:04.589
population of hard working um laborers. So how did

370
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:07.109
you accomplish this? This became a topic that became

371
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:10.680
more and more interesting to state builders over the

372
00:20:10.689 --> 00:20:13.750
course of the 17 hundreds. It hadn't really been

373
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.910
that interesting a question to people some hundreds of

374
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.510
years earlier. So if you look at ideas about

375
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.270
how to govern properly, I mean, even in Machiavelli,

376
00:20:23.819 --> 00:20:26.489
he wasn't really interested in how you make the

377
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.609
population hearty and robust. He was concerned about how

378
00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:33.089
you made sure the population wasn't so annoyed and

379
00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.209
disaffected and pissed off from the state that it

380
00:20:35.219 --> 00:20:38.479
might rebel. And he was conscious that you needed

381
00:20:38.489 --> 00:20:40.680
to have enough food to feed your army. If

382
00:20:40.689 --> 00:20:42.439
you had an army, you wanted to make sure

383
00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.750
there wasn't a famine because again, people might be

384
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.189
really unhappy about that. But, you know, having like

385
00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:49.839
a hearty population, that wasn't his focus, but that

386
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:53.020
became more and more of a focus over the

387
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.339
17 hundreds. And so statesmen and political theorists began

388
00:20:57.349 --> 00:21:00.500
to think, what sort of foods could we be

389
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.099
encouraging the population to eat. It's got to be

390
00:21:03.109 --> 00:21:06.770
cheap because we're not thinking about restructuring the entire

391
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.180
social order so that poor people have more money.

392
00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:11.180
No, no. You want to make sure that poor

393
00:21:11.189 --> 00:21:14.510
people on their limited pennies could be as healthy

394
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:21.209
as possible. And potatoes were increasingly identified as an

395
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:24.910
ideal food stuff that were cheap. People could grow

396
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.270
them themselves. They didn't even need to buy them

397
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.910
whatsoever. And they would in fact allow people those

398
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.530
hearty peasants nourished on potatoes could then work for

399
00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.250
somebody, a landlord growing wheat which could then be

400
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.300
exported to some other lesson, you know, enlightened country

401
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.209
that hadn't figured out how to get its population

402
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:47.099
eating potatoes. So the balance of trade would be

403
00:21:47.109 --> 00:21:49.290
positive. It was, you know, part of a virtuous

404
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.050
circle of becoming more powerful than your neighbor. So

405
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.709
potatoes were the subject of an enormous promotional campaign

406
00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:58.869
across Europe during the 17 hundreds for those very

407
00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.380
reasons.

408
00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:03.459
Uh So please correct me if I'm wrong. But

409
00:22:03.469 --> 00:22:06.849
I guess that it was very tied to the

410
00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:11.800
rise of nations as we understand them today or

411
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.869
not. I mean, the the idea of nation uh

412
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.770
and, and the nations that developed throughout particularly the

413
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:24.280
late 18th, 19th and 20th century or not. Because

414
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.920
I was trying to understand here if this sort

415
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.339
of uh transformation in terms of uh uh this

416
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:35.219
sort of ideological transformation in terms of how politically

417
00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:39.540
we think about nutrition was tied to certain specific

418
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.359
uh political developments or if it was mostly intellectual

419
00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:49.050
developments coming from thinkers and other philosophers that eventually

420
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.135
started paying attention into that. Uh What what, what

421
00:22:53.145 --> 00:22:56.694
happened here exactly that led to this transformation.

422
00:22:56.704 --> 00:22:58.974
So I think the big changes that took place

423
00:22:58.984 --> 00:23:01.824
during the 17 hundreds were about how you govern

424
00:23:01.834 --> 00:23:04.545
properly and what you, what's what was necessary to

425
00:23:04.555 --> 00:23:07.935
have a powerful state. Absolutely, I really agree with

426
00:23:07.944 --> 00:23:10.435
you. Those are strongly linked to the emergence of

427
00:23:10.444 --> 00:23:13.755
of modern nation states. So I mean, the very

428
00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:16.494
idea of public health in a sense, assume some

429
00:23:16.505 --> 00:23:19.530
kind of concept of a public and of a

430
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.650
and that's in the modern period has been connected

431
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.319
to the idea of of a national population. So

432
00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:27.920
this is the same period when states started getting

433
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.199
interested, I mean, in doing censuses, I just, you

434
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:32.020
know, just for the most basic level, knowing how

435
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.780
many people there were in France or in Britain

436
00:23:36.569 --> 00:23:38.680
or in England as it would, you know, I

437
00:23:38.689 --> 00:23:43.400
those those questions are all interconnected. So it's absolutely

438
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.150
right. It became part of what you needed to

439
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.729
do to be a modern state is you needed

440
00:23:46.739 --> 00:23:50.849
to understand the population, you needed to, to know

441
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.219
who these people were and that the population was

442
00:23:55.229 --> 00:23:58.150
considered to be part of the the raw material

443
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.430
in a way of what made a powerful state.

444
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:02.030
And so, I mean, these aren't my insights, these

445
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.550
are ideas that that many scholars I have commented

446
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.569
on. So, I mean, people like Michelle Foucault were

447
00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:11.650
writing about this 50 years ago. So the view

448
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.069
increasingly was developing in the enlightenment that just as

449
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:19.219
a nation had natural resources that might consist of

450
00:24:19.229 --> 00:24:24.079
mineral reserves or abundant water supplies or certain crops

451
00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:26.670
that grew. Well, the population too was a sort

452
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.770
of natural resource and you needed to understand it.

453
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.670
And so that you needed a census because you

454
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.939
needed to know how large this resource was just

455
00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:38.800
as you needed to know how many trees there

456
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.189
were in your forest. So you could think about

457
00:24:41.199 --> 00:24:42.939
how you were going to be using the the

458
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:47.619
timber resources. So they're absolutely interconnected and the emergence

459
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:52.170
of of nutritional science as a branch of chemistry,

460
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.050
it partly came out of people being curious about

461
00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.650
understanding foodstuffs, but often those curiosities were very explicitly

462
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:06.709
connected to a nationalist impulse to ensure that your

463
00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:10.729
nation was more powerful. So explorations and like how

464
00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:13.089
much food did people actually need? How much is

465
00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:17.510
enough? What's, what's the kind of minimum standard that

466
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.839
people can survive on? Those ideas were often very

467
00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:25.619
strongly linked to nationalist impulses or moments of military

468
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.969
expansion and involves often, you know, lots of we

469
00:25:29.979 --> 00:25:32.530
could say pure science but coming out of a

470
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.760
of a larger nation building impulse. Yeah.

471
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:38.959
And since we're talking here about the emergence of

472
00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:43.079
modernity and another aspect that came along with it

473
00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:47.810
was the upward increase in in the world's population.

474
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.959
Were potatoes also tied to that.

475
00:25:51.609 --> 00:25:54.209
Well, there certainly are scholars who argued that there

476
00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:58.089
have been scholars who tried to correlate the growth

477
00:25:58.099 --> 00:26:02.069
of population, whether in Europe or worldwide with increasing

478
00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:05.119
cultivation of potatoes. So there's certainly scholars who've made

479
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.969
that claim, but there, there are a couple of

480
00:26:06.979 --> 00:26:10.719
economists who did a kind of meta analysis um

481
00:26:10.729 --> 00:26:13.880
of world population in which they claim that potatoes

482
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.069
were responsible for something like 20 5% of global

483
00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:20.380
population growth since the 15 hundreds. I mean, I

484
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.979
I don't know if I can um endorse that

485
00:26:22.989 --> 00:26:25.140
position or not, but you know, there are people

486
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.500
who claim that and have been claiming it for

487
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.910
some time. But these claims the idea that the

488
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:35.239
population is fueled by, by potatoes or the potatoes,

489
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:40.449
fuel population growth. That idea itself emerged in the

490
00:26:40.459 --> 00:26:43.520
17 hundreds, which was why potatoes were being promoted

491
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.459
so much. So there were lots of comments of

492
00:26:45.469 --> 00:26:49.489
people saying potatoes are really great crop for population

493
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.180
growth. If you have any doubt, look at Ireland.

494
00:26:52.189 --> 00:26:55.810
So Ireland was often held up in the 18th

495
00:26:55.819 --> 00:27:01.199
century as exhibit a to demonstrate how fabulous potatoes

496
00:27:01.209 --> 00:27:03.130
are. And they would say, look at Ireland, people

497
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.380
have huge numbers of Children. They either have, you

498
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.359
know, 89, 10 Children, all eating potatoes, which they're

499
00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:12.010
growing themselves. What is superfood stuff? You know what,

500
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.319
what could possibly be better? So the ability of

501
00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:19.969
the potato to fuel population growth was something that

502
00:27:19.979 --> 00:27:22.609
was widely claimed at the time, which was why

503
00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:24.979
it was so popular with Statesmen.

504
00:27:26.109 --> 00:27:29.920
And you mentioned Ireland there. And of course, we

505
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.449
have to talk here a little bit about one

506
00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:37.119
major historical event, potato related. That was the great

507
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:42.670
famine that lasted from 1845 to 1848. So could

508
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.890
you tell us a little bit about that? What

509
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.680
happened exactly how back then the British government responded

510
00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:53.439
to the famine. And I guess that also another

511
00:27:53.449 --> 00:27:55.420
thing that you mentioned in one of your books

512
00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.319
is how the government tried to discipline people into

513
00:28:00.329 --> 00:28:03.109
wage labor back then. So, could you tell us

514
00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:05.400
a little bit about those aspects?

515
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:11.400
Yeah. So there was a terrible blight that spread

516
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.920
across many parts of Europe in the 18 forties.

517
00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:17.319
Um It was called the Late Blight. It's a,

518
00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:21.449
it's a potato disease which is actually um on

519
00:28:21.459 --> 00:28:23.000
the rise today. And as a, you know, a

520
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.810
source of concern to potato cultivators today, it was

521
00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:29.880
absolutely devastating. It causes the potatoes to rot and

522
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.380
to develop a, a kind of to just collapse

523
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:37.329
into a kind of smelly rotten mush. And this,

524
00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:42.239
this blight spread across Ireland in the 18 forties,

525
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.969
but actually a number of other European countries as

526
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:46.890
well. It was present in the low countries in

527
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.400
Belgium, et cetera where it caused tens of thousands

528
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.500
of deaths in places like Belgium. So it was

529
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.319
quite devastating in other parts of, of western Europe.

530
00:28:58.329 --> 00:29:02.650
But in Ireland, the bla the late blight caused

531
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.040
maybe a million deaths of some hunger and hunger

532
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.630
induced diseases when the crop failed year after year.

533
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.180
And the reason why in Ireland, the mortality was

534
00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:20.010
so horrendous. It was so much greater than mortality

535
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.219
in other parts of western Europe, which were also

536
00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:25.680
hit by this, this crop failure was because in

537
00:29:25.689 --> 00:29:31.839
Ireland, the diet of working people in the countryside

538
00:29:31.849 --> 00:29:36.119
had been reduced almost entirely to potatoes. And that

539
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.209
was not the case in places like Belgium where

540
00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:40.020
people were a, were able to eat a more

541
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.869
diverse diet. Why was this? Well, it was a

542
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.010
combination of the fact that the potato is such

543
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.420
a nutritious foods stuff as you were asking about

544
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.829
a little while ago. And the fact that the

545
00:29:54.839 --> 00:30:00.150
Irish rural population had been squeezed onto tinier and

546
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.359
tinier plots of land as Europe, as British colonialism

547
00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:07.790
advanced and more and more land was brought into

548
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.300
commercial crop cultivation and the size of land holdings

549
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.420
that peasant farmers um we're trying to live off

550
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:18.069
got smaller and smaller. But because the potato was

551
00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:20.339
such a nourishing food stuff, it was, you know,

552
00:30:20.349 --> 00:30:23.079
just about possible to keep body and soul together

553
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.500
if you had a potato patch even better if

554
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.099
you had maybe enough land to have a, a

555
00:30:28.109 --> 00:30:30.189
cow and you could get some of that dairy

556
00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:32.339
that helps complement the potato and make it a

557
00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:35.229
more nourishing food stuff. So the situation was kind

558
00:30:35.239 --> 00:30:38.530
of just about sustainable at a, at a level

559
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.089
of, you know, sort of just above total immiserate

560
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.579
because the potato was, was so nourishing. And because

561
00:30:45.589 --> 00:30:49.619
the situation in Ireland was so fragile, but because

562
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.719
it was so fragile when the crop failed and

563
00:30:51.729 --> 00:30:54.599
utter devastation was the consequence. So I I it

564
00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:58.010
resulted in, in um the deaths of, you know,

565
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.079
something like one out of eight people and the

566
00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:06.750
migration uh to um the breast of the British

567
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.040
Isles or to um across the ocean to the

568
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.420
United States, for example, that may be another million

569
00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.699
people out of a population of 8 million. So

570
00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:17.219
it was absolutely devastating. And it tells you something

571
00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:20.910
about how important the potato had become in Ireland,

572
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.130
that it had this, this terrible effect. But you

573
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.229
were also asking about the response of the, the

574
00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:29.709
the British government, which has been a topic of

575
00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:33.489
much research and much um debate among Irish historians

576
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.170
for, for a very long time. And there's a,

577
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.469
a vast body of really excellent work. What seems

578
00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:43.869
really clear is that the response of the government

579
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.780
in London to the famine was not one of

580
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.489
wholehearted horror and dismay. There was of course concern

581
00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:57.500
and the government wasn't in, in London wasn't simply

582
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.579
delighted to see a terrible famine leaving leading to

583
00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:03.219
such poverty. And there were efforts at famine relief

584
00:32:03.229 --> 00:32:06.670
of varying sorts. But there was also a sense

585
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.160
that this was as 11 of um one official

586
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.180
put it, you know, a bit of a godsend

587
00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:17.369
because terrible though it was, it was going to

588
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.040
like it or not. And from the point of

589
00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.569
view of the British government, it was more like

590
00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:22.650
it rather than not like it, it was going

591
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.410
to sweep away the old system of peasant farming

592
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.839
that was seen increasingly by the sort of free

593
00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:34.449
marketeers in London as being an obstacle to modernity.

594
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.520
So the very potato that in the 17 hundreds

595
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.430
had been held up by Statesmen as being a

596
00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:46.890
super example of a wonderful population building food was

597
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.510
now seen as a big impediment to modernity. So

598
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.750
in the, in the 17 hundreds, when potatoes were

599
00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.910
being promoted as a source of population growth and

600
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.790
nat you know, national strength, people were saying potatoes

601
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.380
encourage population growth. They're so nourishing, they're great and

602
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.829
because people can cultivate them for themselves in their

603
00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:12.380
own little, you know, allotment ground, they don't have

604
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.119
to depend on the market, they don't have to

605
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:17.239
buy them, they don't have to enter into the

606
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.719
capitalist world effectively and they can be self sufficient

607
00:33:20.949 --> 00:33:24.739
and isn't that great. It protects people from vicissitudes

608
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.189
in the market. That was kind of the view

609
00:33:26.199 --> 00:33:30.209
in the 17 hundreds. By the 18 hundreds, the

610
00:33:30.219 --> 00:33:33.910
situation was perceived as being very different. The last

611
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.010
thing that you wanted, if you were somebody trying

612
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.969
to build a modern capitalist economic system, the last

613
00:33:38.979 --> 00:33:42.069
thing you wanted was peasants who could opt out

614
00:33:42.079 --> 00:33:45.920
of wage labor, which was exactly what the potato

615
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.760
was seen as facilitating in Ireland. So there were

616
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:54.390
various comments by treasury officials, for example, in London

617
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.750
during the famine saying, well, terrible thing what's happening

618
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.060
in Ireland, but at least it's gonna sweep away

619
00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:05.459
this archaic old system of peasant farmers. And in

620
00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:07.300
the future, all of these people are gonna have

621
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.590
to become wage laborers. They're gonna have to work

622
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.250
for somebody else. They're gonna have to earn a

623
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.168
salary and a wage and they're going to use

624
00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.918
that wage to buy food on the market and

625
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.580
it's gonna bring them unwillingly into the modern world.

626
00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.239
So this is in the long run. Really a

627
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.978
good thing.

628
00:34:23.658 --> 00:34:27.428
Mhm. Uh Thi this is actually very interesting because

629
00:34:27.438 --> 00:34:31.529
actually, as we've been talking about here since I

630
00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:36.259
asked you that question about how enlightenment thinkers and

631
00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:41.099
uh politicians in the modern era fought about potatoes.

632
00:34:41.108 --> 00:34:44.559
I mean, there have been in across time, uh

633
00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:49.168
contradictory views about the potatoes. Sometimes it's, it's been

634
00:34:49.178 --> 00:34:52.599
seen as a source of nourishment other times it's

635
00:34:52.608 --> 00:34:56.717
been associated with poverty. And also, I guess you

636
00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:59.708
mentioned capitalism there in the, in the early days

637
00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:07.600
of capitalism, um perhaps the first few socialists out

638
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.889
there, I guess also associated the potato to a

639
00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:15.729
certain extent with uh exploitation. Uh CORRECT. So there

640
00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:21.239
are some contradictory views in Europe and elsewhere about

641
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.479
what the potato really politically represents.

642
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.570
Yeah, that's absolutely right. So, for these um free

643
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.709
market capitalists in, in the London Treasury office, the

644
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:38.909
potato was seen as being an obstacle to a

645
00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.620
capitalist modernity. It was a way of allowing people

646
00:35:42.629 --> 00:35:45.219
to opt out of the market and to remain

647
00:35:45.229 --> 00:35:48.280
self sufficient. And it was bad for, for that

648
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.500
reason. And there was a whole school of thought

649
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.530
that saw the potato as being part of a

650
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.635
sort of archaic peasant world that didn't really fit

651
00:35:56.645 --> 00:36:01.114
with modernity or that involved people being isolated and

652
00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:05.175
separated out from the modern world, not just disconnected

653
00:36:05.185 --> 00:36:08.385
from waged labor, but disconnected from a kind of

654
00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:12.475
political organization. It's not a coincidence that um Karl

655
00:36:12.485 --> 00:36:14.554
Marx, you know, one of the great critics of

656
00:36:14.564 --> 00:36:18.754
of capitalism or the great analysts as well described

657
00:36:18.764 --> 00:36:21.614
peasants in France as being like potatoes in a

658
00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:29.199
sack. Because for him, the peasant lifestyle prevented people

659
00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:33.320
from developing associational links and developing it prevented them

660
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.969
from developing a sense of class identity. And so

661
00:36:36.979 --> 00:36:39.600
for him, the potatoes summed that all up, right?

662
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:45.370
You know, this was a um a antimo crop

663
00:36:45.379 --> 00:36:48.290
that kept people isolated. So there was that that

664
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.830
sort of view of the potato as well. And

665
00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:54.959
you get critiques then in other words, both from

666
00:36:54.969 --> 00:36:58.239
the left and from the right of the potato

667
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.469
is being a bad thing, other people, other leftist

668
00:37:01.479 --> 00:37:03.689
critiques, if we can put it that way of

669
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:08.629
of the potato stressed that the potato actually enabled

670
00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:12.110
exploitation. So there were people who looked at Ireland

671
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.629
before the the famine in the 18 forties and

672
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:18.709
said, how is it possible that this exploitative situation

673
00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:21.110
exists? How is it possible that people are living

674
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.310
on these tiny crops of land? You know, just

675
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.250
about surviving? Um YOU know, barely able to keep

676
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.600
their, their, their families fed, but you know, just

677
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.550
about able to do that. Why is that possible

678
00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:36.560
because of the potato, which is an evil food

679
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.040
stuff? Because it's enabling exploitation. If there weren't potatoes,

680
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.100
the situation wouldn't be tenable and people wouldn't put

681
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.989
up with this level of terrible exploitation. So there

682
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.959
were people who criticized potatoes for enabling um terrible

683
00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:55.689
exploitation as well. So that, you know, sort of,

684
00:37:55.699 --> 00:37:58.639
from every angle, people were writing about potatoes and

685
00:37:58.649 --> 00:38:02.570
connecting them to this new form of economic organization

686
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.600
that was emerging in the 19th century. And so

687
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.399
potatoes were kind of surprisingly at the heart of

688
00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:12.800
this debate about what, what capitalism meant to the

689
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:13.320
worker.

690
00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.989
Yeah, I guess that potatoes were both the savior

691
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.469
and the scapegoat for everyone. Yes. So uh so

692
00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:28.010
I have a few more questions relating to still

693
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.340
the history of the potato, but some broader questions

694
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:35.489
about how it relates to the politics of food

695
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.250
more generally and the regulation of the food market.

696
00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.649
So does the history of the potato connect in

697
00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:46.389
any way to attempts by governments to regulate the

698
00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:49.770
food market? Like for example, we're seeing now with

699
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.860
bans on sh sugary and salty foods and to

700
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:58.899
the way certain political ideologies react to this kind

701
00:38:58.909 --> 00:39:04.250
of market regulations by labeling them, for example, illiberal

702
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.739
or affronts to basic freedoms.

703
00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:10.810
Yeah. So, I mean, right now there's, uh there's

704
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.830
always a backlash whenever any state tries to intervene

705
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.540
in public eating habits by banning sugar, that sort

706
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.790
of thing. There's tends to be a backlash of

707
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.310
people saying this is taking away our basic right

708
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.750
to eat terrible food. And that we should, you

709
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.030
know, we have a kind of, um, philosophical right

710
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.320
to make our own dietary choices. It's up to

711
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.030
us, the state should get out of it. I

712
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.080
mean, this, that view often coexists with the view

713
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.929
that other people ought to be eating better and

714
00:39:41.939 --> 00:39:43.909
that, you know, I can make my own dietary

715
00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:46.080
mistakes, but that other people ought to be eating

716
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.510
more appropriately. There tends to be support in Britain,

717
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.429
for example, for the view that people who are,

718
00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:57.159
um, very overweight, for example, should be, you know,

719
00:39:57.169 --> 00:40:00.719
obliged to lose weight before they have operations that

720
00:40:00.729 --> 00:40:02.820
are paid for out of by the National Health

721
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.429
Service. And that, you know, they, the National Health

722
00:40:05.439 --> 00:40:07.810
Service shouldn't be investing money in people who are

723
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.600
unhealthy through their own fault. Right? I mean, there,

724
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.370
so there's a certain contradictory aspect to, um, to

725
00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:17.540
this public debate. But I think you're right that

726
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:21.310
we can situate these discussions about whether people should

727
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.110
or shouldn't eat potatoes into a longer history of

728
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.310
that kind of um those kinds of debates. So

729
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.389
the emergence in the enlightenment, that's to say during

730
00:40:33.399 --> 00:40:37.850
the the 18th century of the view that people

731
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.500
ought to eat more potatoes because they were healthful

732
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.610
and nutritious and would encourage population growth. With those

733
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.520
those sorts of ideas which were leading these political

734
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:53.149
thinkers to encourage potatoes and make propaganda for why

735
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.879
potatoes were so great. Those ideas emerged kind of

736
00:40:56.889 --> 00:41:00.870
simultaneously with the emergence of, of the theorization of

737
00:41:00.879 --> 00:41:04.229
the free market as a good thing. So exactly

738
00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:07.129
at the time that people were saying potatoes really

739
00:41:07.139 --> 00:41:11.100
good food, everybody should eat more potatoes. You should

740
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.030
choose to eat more potatoes, it would be better

741
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.449
for you. You personally, you'd be a lot stronger

742
00:41:15.459 --> 00:41:18.820
and healthier and happier if you just ate potatoes

743
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.300
and they're tasty and your kids will like them.

744
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.280
It would be good for the population as a

745
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.439
whole and our state would be stronger and we

746
00:41:27.449 --> 00:41:30.159
would be more powerful. Everybody would win, right? If

747
00:41:30.169 --> 00:41:32.780
everybody just chose to eat potatoes, you don't have

748
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.209
to be doing it out of any kind of

749
00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:36.919
self sacrifice because they're so yummy. But if you

750
00:41:36.929 --> 00:41:41.209
just did, everybody would win. These ideas were emerging

751
00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:43.459
at exactly the same time that people like Adam

752
00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:46.580
Smith were arguing that actually the state should get

753
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.739
out of regulating trading and markets and that people

754
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.419
should just be allowed to make their own financial

755
00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:55.169
decisions out of the pursuing their own interests. And

756
00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:58.129
they should be allowed as much as possible to

757
00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:02.179
barter and truck and to exchange goods and to

758
00:42:02.189 --> 00:42:07.139
engage in, in commercial activities unrestricted by the state

759
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.899
and looking after only their own personal interests. But

760
00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:14.699
that, that would then kind of magically result in

761
00:42:14.709 --> 00:42:19.939
a smoother flowing more efficient economic system overall. So

762
00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:22.239
people like Adam Smith, I mean, he wasn't alone,

763
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.540
but people like Adam Smith argued that the more

764
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:28.330
the state tried to oblige people to trade or

765
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.209
not trade in particular ways, the more it was

766
00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:32.800
likely to store up trouble for the future and

767
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.280
that people should just be allowed to organize themselves

768
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.879
and that would create a smoothly flowing economic system.

769
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.219
And I hope you can see the similarities between

770
00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:45.050
that kind of economic position and the idea that

771
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.949
people should just choose to eat those foods, not

772
00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:51.000
because they're forced to, but because it's in their

773
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.830
own personal interests and they're freely choosing to do

774
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.010
so. So potato promotion usually was in the form

775
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.209
of strong encouragement rather than a dick to that

776
00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:03.139
you had to eat it. And I think we

777
00:43:03.149 --> 00:43:05.379
can sort of trace back to that in the

778
00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:11.250
17 hundreds, our sort of contradictory relationship between state

779
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.300
advice and our own eating habits that, you know,

780
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.030
we sort of feel it's our business and it's

781
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.229
part of our freedom the same way that we

782
00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:22.530
might think, um, you know, the free market is

783
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.560
somehow a good thing. One might think that, you

784
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.550
know, the state shouldn't be managing economies too much.

785
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.100
It's, it might be argued by, by people who,

786
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.330
who support that view and that we should be

787
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.199
allowed to make our own decisions. But that if

788
00:43:35.209 --> 00:43:38.409
everybody made their own decisions sensibly, then everything would

789
00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:41.399
work out for the best. Right? And then somehow

790
00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:45.010
dietary choices will naturally self organize into a good

791
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.219
system, just as individual, economic choices will self organize

792
00:43:49.229 --> 00:43:50.719
into a good system. I mean, I think the

793
00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:56.669
evidence that individual dietary choices naturally form an effective

794
00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.580
and smooth system, I think the evidence for that

795
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.709
is slight. I don't think that there's a lot

796
00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:03.719
of evidence that we make good dietary choices. But

797
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:05.669
those ideas emerged at the same time,

798
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.699
a a and actually related to that, do we

799
00:44:09.709 --> 00:44:14.570
really choose what we eat? As perhaps some people

800
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.530
that come more from the side of this ideology

801
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.820
of personal responsibility and some more uh neo liberal

802
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:27.489
takes on social programs and so on would uh

803
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:28.489
claim,

804
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.939
well, I mean, I, so I would say that

805
00:44:31.949 --> 00:44:35.639
if, um, if we were not being persuaded to

806
00:44:35.649 --> 00:44:40.239
eat different things, if persuasion, if persuasion was ineffective,

807
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.879
no money would be spent on advertising. So, I

808
00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:46.399
mean, I, I think that we're, I think we're

809
00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:49.540
not the free agents of our own diets to

810
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.409
the extent that we might imagine they are. I

811
00:44:51.419 --> 00:44:53.280
mean, I often ask my students, I teach the

812
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.399
history of food and I often ask them, well,

813
00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:57.719
why do you choose the things that you eat?

814
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.629
And students will often say, oh, because I like

815
00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:02.649
them, you know, these are things that are tasty

816
00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:06.189
and sometimes they'll talk about cost as well. But

817
00:45:06.199 --> 00:45:08.659
they, their answers usually start with because that's what

818
00:45:08.669 --> 00:45:12.229
I like and then couple that to a question

819
00:45:12.239 --> 00:45:13.949
about and this is, you know, and I this

820
00:45:13.959 --> 00:45:16.540
these things I can afford but the extent to

821
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.270
which what we like is shaped by the larger

822
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.229
circumstances, I I think is an important topic. And

823
00:45:22.239 --> 00:45:25.379
behavioral economists pay attention to that and they look

824
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:29.219
at the way in which we're incredibly persuadable. And

825
00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.639
also I think how we, we make poor dietary

826
00:45:32.649 --> 00:45:36.679
decisions, not simply because we're persuaded, but also because

827
00:45:36.689 --> 00:45:39.780
we just don't have a very good mechanism for

828
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.199
evaluating what actually is good for us. You know,

829
00:45:43.209 --> 00:45:45.100
we don't have a very good set of bio,

830
00:45:45.429 --> 00:45:48.540
we're not very attuned often to what our body

831
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.239
is telling us anyway. But yeah, I think the

832
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.959
idea of choices is deeply flawed in general.

833
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.260
And actually, and this is something that uh many

834
00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:04.590
sociologists criticize, I guess. Uh THE idea of food

835
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:11.010
choice also ties uh a lot to socio-economic status,

836
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.679
right? Because poor people, particularly in more developed countries

837
00:46:16.689 --> 00:46:21.850
uh represent in terms of percentage. Uh uh I

838
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.995
mean, there are more of these people among lower,

839
00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:29.574
uh, the people that are of the lower socio-economic

840
00:46:29.584 --> 00:46:35.054
status than higher socio-economic status because of the foods

841
00:46:35.064 --> 00:46:39.235
they can afford and basically have access to, for

842
00:46:39.245 --> 00:46:39.735
example.

843
00:46:39.764 --> 00:46:42.175
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's absolutely right. And so

844
00:46:42.185 --> 00:46:45.239
there are all kinds of factors that push people

845
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.939
with less money into eating less healthy diets. So,

846
00:46:49.949 --> 00:46:51.540
I mean, the cost of the food is, is

847
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:54.620
absolutely one of them. There's a question of time.

848
00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:57.280
So, you know, it's all very well to say

849
00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:01.379
that you can um cook a nutritious meal um

850
00:47:01.389 --> 00:47:04.080
for a much, you know, for a smaller amount,

851
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.010
a smaller cost than it is to buy. Um,

852
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.179
YOU know, fast food, for example, but if you

853
00:47:10.189 --> 00:47:12.469
don't have hours and hours to cook pots of

854
00:47:12.479 --> 00:47:16.139
chickpeas, for example, then you, you know, you're not

855
00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:18.449
going to be able to make a nutritious Chickpea

856
00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:21.129
based dish. So there's a question about not just

857
00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:25.360
money, poverty, but time poverty, their access to cooking

858
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:29.310
facilities at all. So people might be living in

859
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.649
a small flat, which actually doesn't really have proper

860
00:47:31.659 --> 00:47:33.459
cooking facilities at all. You might just have a

861
00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:36.639
microwave or something like that. So the technologies of

862
00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:40.530
cooking are also unequally distributed. And I mean, there's

863
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.439
a old historical argument going, going back to the

864
00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:48.129
eighties um that was first developed by, by Sydney

865
00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:50.709
Mintz who wrote a wonderful classic book on the

866
00:47:50.719 --> 00:47:53.300
History of Sugar in which he argued that part

867
00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:55.360
of the reason that people in Britain became a

868
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:59.479
nation of sweet tea drinkers was because during the

869
00:47:59.489 --> 00:48:03.739
industrial revolution, people working in textile mills or in

870
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:08.080
other industries had very little access to cooking equipment.

871
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.300
They had very little time and they had very

872
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.320
little money and boiling some water might be about

873
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.659
as sophisticated AAA cooking activity as you were able

874
00:48:17.669 --> 00:48:20.179
to engage in. And that a cup of very,

875
00:48:20.189 --> 00:48:24.189
very sweet tea, maybe with some bread that you'd

876
00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:26.840
purchased in a shop spread with some very, very

877
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.909
sugary jam that you'd also purchased might be the

878
00:48:29.919 --> 00:48:33.219
cheapest source of calories that, that you could have.

879
00:48:33.229 --> 00:48:35.350
And the only thing you really were able to

880
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.110
prepare, you know, you didn't have an oven to

881
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.989
cook, nourishing, you know, stews or anything like that.

882
00:48:41.149 --> 00:48:43.320
And that, that's where this taste for super sweet

883
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.800
tea originated. He argued. So all of those things,

884
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.600
you know, time money, um cooking facilities come together

885
00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:55.090
to push people to eat particular foods, which they

886
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.590
might ultimately then come to enjoy, you know, sweet

887
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.770
tea might be something that people then really enjoy.

888
00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:02.429
But the forces that pushed them into that dietary

889
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.580
choice where by, you know, by no means a

890
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.409
choice.

891
00:49:06.389 --> 00:49:09.139
So, and this will probably be my last question

892
00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:13.209
and still related to food regulations. Uh So I,

893
00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:15.520
I guess that at the same time, we have

894
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:20.989
this sort of ambivalent idea or ambivalent attitude toward

895
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.689
food regulation because even if uh many times like

896
00:49:25.699 --> 00:49:29.290
when it comes to banning sugary drinks or regulating,

897
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:35.459
get directed at Children specifically. For example, uh, many

898
00:49:35.469 --> 00:49:38.919
times we might not like that kind of thing

899
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.919
because we associate it with paternal, with paternalism and

900
00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:47.229
so on. Other times we actually like food regulation.

901
00:49:47.239 --> 00:49:49.780
Like, for example, a few years ago, with the

902
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.879
horse meat scandal. Right.

903
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.899
Yeah. Like, people want the state to ensure that

904
00:49:56.909 --> 00:50:01.030
the food that they're buying is, is wholesome. And

905
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.840
so if it turns out that there's contaminated horse

906
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.590
meat, this was about, yeah, 10 years ago, there

907
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.070
was this big scandal all through Europe, right about

908
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.239
where it turned out that horse meat had made

909
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.879
its way into all kinds of dishes that you

910
00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:16.139
could buy in the chilled food section and that

911
00:50:16.149 --> 00:50:19.870
the beef lasagna was actually, you know, a very

912
00:50:19.879 --> 00:50:23.979
aged horse that had been shredded up. Um, SO

913
00:50:23.989 --> 00:50:26.760
people feel really betrayed when the state doesn't ensure

914
00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.949
that their food is safe. So there's an expectation

915
00:50:29.959 --> 00:50:31.250
on the one hand that the state should be

916
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.070
regulating the food supply. And that goes way back

917
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.189
to ancient times when it was considered a basic

918
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.320
obligation of the state to regulate the safety of

919
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:43.429
the food supply. But that safety then, you know,

920
00:50:43.439 --> 00:50:47.540
where that safety control of whether the food is

921
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.479
basically wholesome where that then edges into saying actually,

922
00:50:50.489 --> 00:50:53.020
basically sugar is basically really bad for you. You

923
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.330
just shouldn't eat that much. That, that is seen

924
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.820
as being, um, you know, um, unacceptable. So, we're

925
00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.669
quite contradictory, I think in our attitudes towards what

926
00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:04.090
we want the state to be doing.

927
00:51:04.629 --> 00:51:07.979
Mhm. Uh, GREAT. So, I guess this is a

928
00:51:07.989 --> 00:51:11.290
good point to wrap up the interview and then

929
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.020
Doctor Earl just before we go, uh, I'm leaving

930
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.219

932
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.709
also like to tell people where they can find

934
00:51:25.179 --> 00:51:28.580

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.020
to do this? Um Where could you find me?

936
