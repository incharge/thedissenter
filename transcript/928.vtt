00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.849
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob and the MG

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.199
by Doctor Charles Roseman. He is an Associate Professor

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.140
of Evolution, Ecology and Behavior at the University of

5
00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:16.000
Illinois at Urbana Champaign. He studies the evolution of

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.899
complex traits. And today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.719
complex traits, how they evolve in in evolution, particularly

8
00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:29.600
focusing on neanderthals and homo sapiens hereditary is differences

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.889
between human populations and sex. So, Doctor Roseman, welcome

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.590
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:39.169
Thank you very much for the invitation.

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.439
So let's start then with complex traits. So, first

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.110
of all, what is a complex trait from an

14
00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.270
evolutionary perspective? I mean, what it, it makes the

15
00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:56.610
difference between a complex trait and I guess we

16
00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.430
could say a simple rate.

17
00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:02.250
So, uh the the funny thing is that the

18
00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.430
complex traits are often simpler than the, the the

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.199
simple traits. Um AND that a complex traits are

20
00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:13.150
usually the ones where there are many, many different

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.150
genetic and environmental influences that come together either in

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.349
combination or in interaction to produce variation in a

23
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.029
trait and the in humans, the canonical complex trait

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940
is height stature. So I'll tell you, I'll tell

25
00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:36.459
you are. And, um, this contrast from what we

26
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.440
think of as simple Mendelian traits. So, uh, the,

27
00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:45.599
the various, uh, things that Mendel was looking at

28
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.010
in his pea plants and that sort of thing,

29
00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:51.500
it turns out that there are not that many

30
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.489
of those simple traits, those Mendelian traits, most of

31
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.180
the traits that we deal with when we're dealing

32
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.099
with organisms in just about any context are complex

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.459
in that they have lots and lots and lots

34
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.080
of different influences. Now, complex isn't necessarily a, a

35
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.009
very good word. Uh Complexity is a bit of

36
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.789
a trap because everybody thinks they know what it

37
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.520
is and I haven't heard a satisfactory definition for

38
00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.559
it in general. Um So, uh one of the

39
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.979
nice things about complex traits, like stature that is

40
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.339
height and um any of the morphological characteristics that

41
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.369
I tend to study is that they're amenable to

42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.009
uh kind of a uh a statistical summary approach.

43
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.649
We don't need to know the identity of every

44
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.089
single gene or environmental influence to make statements about

45
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.259
how relatives are going to resemble one another and

46
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.050
to predict how they're going to evolve.

47
00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.020
But uh I mean, how do you approach the

48
00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.080
study of complex streets? Because I know that particularly

49
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:07.699
for evolutionarily minded researchers many times the way they

50
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.639
go about things is that they start from an

51
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:15.009
adaptation is perspective. But uh of course, there are

52
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.020
other mechanisms through which it rates evolve or come

53
00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.759
about. Like, for example, sometimes they are by products

54
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.229
or uh how some people call them spend rolls

55
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.070
other times they come about through genetic drift. So

56
00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.309
how do you approach their study? Exactly?

57
00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.630
OK. So uh the you brought up the adaptation

58
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.449
approach and um well, I think that natural selection

59
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.419
is, is quite important and don't, don't get me

60
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.220
wrong on that. Um I get a little worried

61
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.399
about the adaptation approach. So, and the reason for

62
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.660
that is that uh uh if you are looking

63
00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.949
at an organism and you see it doing something

64
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.750
that strikes you as interesting and then you say,

65
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.679
then it must have evolved to do that. Well,

66
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.550
what are you doing? Well, um this is very

67
00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.170
similar to the natural theological argument that say William

68
00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:20.670
Paley came up with quite a long time ago.

69
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.739
He was an influence on Darwin. And the idea

70
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.209
is that in his thought experiment, Paley is walking

71
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.019
through a heath and a meadow or, or something

72
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.019
like that and finds a watch and the watch

73
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:37.220
is complex and it seems to, to track time

74
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.269
and all those sorts of things. And he said

75
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.429
that, well, this is well designed and that means

76
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.529
there must have been a designer. And if you

77
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.940
take natural selection as the designer and put it

78
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.609
into that argument, uh you have only solved a

79
00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.980
part of the problem, you've solved the, the deity

80
00:04:56.989 --> 00:05:00.579
problem, the designer problem, the conscious designer problem. But

81
00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.029
you haven't solved the evolutionary problem. And the evolutionary

82
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.350
problem is the one where, yeah, we would like

83
00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:12.929
to know something about the uh what did the,

84
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.220
what did the organism start as when we are

85
00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.220
interested in the evolution of AAA trait? So we

86
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.489
want to know the ancestral state and then we

87
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.959
want to know the processes, the dynamics that led

88
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.369
up to the characteristic that we're looking at today

89
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.980
or the difference between the organism we're looking at

90
00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:38.410
and the uh and the uh the rest of

91
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.540
the living world. So uh that is um that's

92
00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:46.850
the evolution part. And as you said, that involves

93
00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:51.279
a number of things, recombination. It involves genetic drift.

94
00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:54.299
There might have been gene flow and hybridization. Uh

95
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.709
MUTATION, of course, is very important for keeping variation

96
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.859
around in the first place, all that type of

97
00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:04.970
thing. So, um if we want to do that,

98
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.299
having a dynamical approach is what I would, what

99
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:13.660
I would say, I'd say evolutionary approach. But uh

100
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.029
you know, that seems to dismiss adaptation as not

101
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.750
being evolutionary and that's not, not really my meaning.

102
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.869
Um And the study of complex traits give that

103
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.380
to you. It gives you a way to formalize

104
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.470
the study of the evolution of complex traits so

105
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.890
that you can build models and test hypotheses about

106
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.880
how things changed uh when they did change.

107
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.320
But so just for the audience to get a

108
00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:48.140
better, a more clear picture picture of what we're

109
00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.470
talking about here. Let's say that you uh get

110
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.480
across a complex trait in any kind of species

111
00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:58.950
out there. It might be a behavioral trait or

112
00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:04.910
psychological trait. Uh MORPHOLOGICAL trait. How do you first

113
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.670
approach it study uh theoretically methodologically to really then

114
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.709
understand and know whether it was the result of

115
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.769
natural selection or sometimes specifically sexual selection uh or

116
00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.910
if it was the result of something like genetic

117
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.059
drift, or if it's a by-product of certain specific

118
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.029
adaptations.

119
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.959
Ok. Well, the first thing you need to do

120
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.350
is have a good sense of the organism. You

121
00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:39.190
need to know what you're measuring and you need

122
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.859
to have a sense of how the organism is

123
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:43.149
put together, that includes how it develops so on

124
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.089
and so forth. Let's leave that aside for the

125
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.089
moment. Let's assume that we have that and just

126
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.359
deal with the evolutionary issues. Well, one of the

127
00:07:51.369 --> 00:07:56.690
uh great tools of evolutionary biology is the neutral

128
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.089
theory. And um so this is the idea that

129
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.630
evolution might take place only uh by random genetic

130
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.600
drift and uh random genetic drift. And um the

131
00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:17.140
neutral uh neutral theory of evolution supposes that uh

132
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:19.989
the circumstance under which evolution is taking place only

133
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.519
because of a random genetic drift and neutral mutations

134
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.890
being put into the population. So these are mutations

135
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.099
that don't affect the survivorship and reproduction of the

136
00:08:32.109 --> 00:08:37.619
organisms. So it's uh they're neutral with respect to

137
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.140
fitness. So no natural selection arises as a result.

138
00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:45.359
So, uh what's nice about that is that it

139
00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:49.929
gives us some clear connections between what molecular variation

140
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.489
ought to look like and what phenotypic variation ought

141
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.989
to look like. So, rather than having a coming

142
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.619
up with a infinitely large series of hypotheses and

143
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.049
models and explanations that feature natural selection which can

144
00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:11.559
operate in all kinds of different ways. This allows

145
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.179
us to write out some very simple expectations under

146
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.349
some uh under uh that are restricted in number

147
00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.369
so that, you know, the possibility space is really

148
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.859
small. And what this lets us know is that

149
00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:28.469
uh if we reject the neutral hypothesis or if

150
00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:33.309
another model fits better than the neutral model, then

151
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.030
we have a warrant to go and look deeper,

152
00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:41.700
try to find out if natural selection might have

153
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.419
been operating on something or if there's phenotypic plasticity

154
00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:48.830
that's involved in the variation in the characteristic.

155
00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:54.349
But in your mind, because uh we've mentioned here,

156
00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:58.409
the uh the adaptation is approach, what would you

157
00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:02.630
say are perhaps some of the issues with approaching

158
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.669
the study of uh traits, complex traits or even

159
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:11.320
simple traits uh with an adaptation is uh approach

160
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.640
in mind that is assuming uh that they must

161
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.330
have been the result of natural selection, sexual selection,

162
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.909
that is that they are adaptations starting with that

163
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:26.010
assumption. What are, what do you think are the

164
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.340
issues or might be the issues with that.

165
00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:33.989
Well, um so one of the issues is that

166
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.070
there are very, very many ways in which you

167
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.390
can produce exactly the same thing using natural selection.

168
00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:43.330
Uh You can know a lot about the natural

169
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.669
history. You can tell that if say you reject

170
00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:49.849
a neutral hypothesis uh of the evolution of a

171
00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:53.859
characteristic, uh you can still then have very, very

172
00:10:53.869 --> 00:11:00.929
many uh hypotheses about uh what um uh what

173
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.630
natural selection might have done to adapt an organism.

174
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.070
And this is one of the wonderful things about

175
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.320
Darwin's insights and a few other people as well

176
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.989
is that it, it can explain a lot, that's

177
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.190
also its shortcoming. If natural selection explains everything, it

178
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.530
doesn't really explain much of anything. It doesn't allow

179
00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:24.359
us to make the kinds of distinctions that allow

180
00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:28.270
us to uh you know, uh talk about the

181
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.929
dynamics, what's or come up with plausible alternatives. It's

182
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.549
also an empirical issue. Um uh YOU know, the,

183
00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:40.710
and this is where there's a difference between the

184
00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:43.690
study of humans, what makes humans unique, which is

185
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.260
one instance and the study of say how body

186
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.070
size and brain size evolve together, that involves a

187
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.859
comparative study of lots and lots of organisms as

188
00:11:55.869 --> 00:12:00.090
opposed to just looking at one organism. And the,

189
00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:05.020
the general trends that you might see across, across

190
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.549
vertebrates, across mammals, across whatever uh may give you

191
00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:13.169
a sense of what tends to drive the evolution

192
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:17.609
of any one of these features. But the, it

193
00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:23.049
doesn't necessarily give you a indicator of what drove

194
00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:27.789
any one transition. So, you know, we could have

195
00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:30.580
a very, very clear picture from comparative studies about

196
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.630
what's going on with the evolutions of, of brains

197
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.330
or bodies or whatever and still not have much

198
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.940
of an idea for what is going on with

199
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.190
humans. And we have conspicuously large brains uh that

200
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.059
evolved over, you know, let's say the last 2

201
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.549
million years or so, it's the important bit. And

202
00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:52.109
uh I don't think that there are very many

203
00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:56.489
satisfactory adaptations explanations, even though we're really pretty sure

204
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.650
from another in a number of angles that uh

205
00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:03.780
that natural selection was probably involved. Um It's just

206
00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:06.630
that, you know, and everybody is coming up with

207
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.090
these accounts that propose functions that might relate to

208
00:13:12.099 --> 00:13:16.270
fitness, but we don't really have a uh uh

209
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.289
a good reason to believe many of the stories

210
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.650
over a lot of the other stories. So the

211
00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:26.010
dynamical account is, is quite good in that you

212
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.469
can understand the evolution of something without necessarily understanding

213
00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:34.450
the function. And that's important because there have been

214
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.219
very, very few studies that actually relate what uh

215
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.609
you know, what a morphological characteristic does uh in

216
00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:47.510
the functional biology of an organism to the fitness

217
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.260
of the organism. And then put that in the

218
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.809
context of genetic variation in all of those parts

219
00:13:55.099 --> 00:14:00.200
to describe how it might change. So, uh uh

220
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.979
and that, that is a, um, I'm not saying

221
00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:07.640
it's a, we should expect that of every study.

222
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.780
That's the ideal study that would be absolutely wonderful

223
00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:13.400
to have. But it's certainly beyond the reach. But

224
00:14:13.409 --> 00:14:17.200
it's worth knowing that, uh, that there are serious

225
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.010
limitations that come from the, uh, perspective where you

226
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.190
see something, it seems to do something really well

227
00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:27.380
and it must have evolved for that function that,

228
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.760
that doesn't get you as close to a satisfactory

229
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.200
answer as you might think.

230
00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:38.400
Do you think that perhaps one of the specific

231
00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:42.200
risks here is that if people start from an

232
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:48.080
adaptation perspective, that they are more prone to developing

233
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:52.890
what some people call just so stories about the

234
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.679
evolution and the origins and the development of any

235
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.719
specific trait. Because I would imagine that trying to

236
00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:05.640
uh assume that because a particular trait is there,

237
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.159
then it's because it might uh it probably increased

238
00:15:10.169 --> 00:15:14.289
uh fitness for the organism or the whatever kind

239
00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:17.630
of species we're talking about perhaps makes people more

240
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.000
prone to trying to come up with stories for

241
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.679
why that link is supposedly there or not?

242
00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:30.820
Yeah. Um So the uh I, I think that

243
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.049
is, that is true. If you don't take the

244
00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:35.710
uh dynamic of evolution, if you don't take the

245
00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:40.710
evolutionary history into account, uh then you are prone

246
00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:43.669
to just telling a just so story. I don't

247
00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:46.010
think that's nearly as common as a lot of

248
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.429
people would have us believe certainly not in evolutionary

249
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.869
biology, maybe in some other corners of the world.

250
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:57.179
But um the, the dynamic approach, the sort of

251
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.580
the evolutionary genetic approach, the the complex trait approach

252
00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:05.700
allows you to do a number of other things.

253
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.880
So, one of the things that, uh you know,

254
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.679
if, if we talk about brain size, um you

255
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.770
know, it becomes cons conspicuously large in humans over

256
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.789
the last 2 million years, it was proper natural

257
00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:21.500
selection, driving it along with a few other things.

258
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.960
And um uh most of the models don't believe

259
00:16:25.969 --> 00:16:30.510
it was brain size itself. So, you know, it's

260
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.559
the capacities for certain kinds of behavior, certain kinds

261
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.770
of cognitive uh abilities and so on and so

262
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.049
forth that are supposedly drove it. So what we're

263
00:16:41.059 --> 00:16:44.940
looking at is a correlated response or under this,

264
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.859
under this model would be a correlated response to

265
00:16:47.869 --> 00:16:51.469
natural selection on something else. Now, that happens when

266
00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:56.080
you have a genetic correlation between characteristics, natural selection

267
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.919
works on one, it changes the frequencies of the

268
00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:02.690
alleles that are involved in that one trait. But

269
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.199
those, those uh loci where those uh genetic variants

270
00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:11.180
I should say are um uh those loci, those

271
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:14.060
places in the genome also affect the other trait.

272
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.510
And so the other trait gets dragged along with

273
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.459
it. So you can have strong natural selection on

274
00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:24.098
something else and it can also cause a change

275
00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:27.579
in whatever you happen to be looking at. Now,

276
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.550
um This this raises a problem because that there

277
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.390
are many, many ways in which to measure an

278
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.890
organism and the natural selection can behave in all

279
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.939
kinds of very strange ways. So you very infrequently,

280
00:17:42.489 --> 00:17:46.199
you very, very infrequently think that, um, or are

281
00:17:46.209 --> 00:17:48.949
justified in thinking that you're actually measuring the thing

282
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.170
that is important for driving the fitness differences that

283
00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.650
make natural selection. Ok. So that's one thing we

284
00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.369
could talk about correlated responses. There's always the problem.

285
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.189
Um Not a problem. There are always the possibility

286
00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:08.239
that you're looking at phenotypic plasticity. So uh the

287
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.420
same genotype, if you raise an organism with the

288
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.680
same genotype under different circumstances, you may end up

289
00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:19.030
with a rather different phenotype depending on the environmental

290
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.709
conditions. Uh THAT that happens quite a bit. Um

291
00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:28.550
And then there is also the feature of organisms.

292
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.880
Uh Well, if you, if you look at complex

293
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:36.520
multicellular organisms like us, and uh there's, you look

294
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:40.790
at our genomes, eukaryotic genomes, they're very messy places.

295
00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:45.609
Uh The, the the genome is uniquely inappropriately named

296
00:18:45.619 --> 00:18:48.500
for eukaryotes because almost nothing in it is a

297
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.849
is, is a gene. It's a very, very small

298
00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.109
percentage is actually a gene. And there are all

299
00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:58.319
these repeated elements and transpo elements and retroviral inserts

300
00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:00.589
and any number of other things that go on.

301
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.420
And um so, uh and this is the grounds

302
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.439
for a, a lot of natural selection at a

303
00:19:07.449 --> 00:19:09.869
different level that we don't necessarily appreciate when we're

304
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.599
looking at or at, at full organisms. But also

305
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.839
what's interesting about it is that uh you know,

306
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.719
why is there all that slop in the genome?

307
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.719
It takes forever for us to replicate cells? It's

308
00:19:26.729 --> 00:19:32.829
just incredibly energetically expensive bacteria are just the epitome

309
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.890
of efficiency by comparison. So how does that work

310
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.189
out? Shouldn't natural selection be getting rid of all

311
00:19:39.199 --> 00:19:41.800
of this uh the slop in the system, all

312
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.069
this waste of energy. And um if you think

313
00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:51.050
about bacteria versus humans, uh one notable thing about

314
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.469
bacteria is that there are a lot more bacteria

315
00:19:53.479 --> 00:19:56.189
than there are humans, a lot more bacteria than

316
00:19:56.199 --> 00:19:58.430
there are humans on you right now or on

317
00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:01.979
me right now. And uh what this means is

318
00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:05.189
that the effect of random genetic drift, just those

319
00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:09.280
random changes because of sampling in the in populations

320
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:15.540
very, very practically negligible in bacteria, but profound in

321
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.869
organisms like us or mice or, or mushrooms or

322
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.959
whatever. And what this means is that natural selection

323
00:20:22.969 --> 00:20:28.199
is only so efficient, it's only so good up

324
00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:31.719
to a point and we have to leave room

325
00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:35.060
for that in the model. Uh Because uh the

326
00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:39.000
genetic drift is is ubiquitous and there are lots

327
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.800
and lots of things out there that seem quite

328
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.939
mysterious until you think uh natural selection just isn't

329
00:20:44.949 --> 00:20:45.739
that powerful.

330
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.739
So to try to illustrate all of this with

331
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.359
an example, you've already mentioned a couple of times

332
00:20:53.369 --> 00:20:57.140
there, the evolution of the cranium in hominids, uh

333
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.599
tell us a little bit more about that. And

334
00:20:59.609 --> 00:21:01.849
I know that you've done work, for example, on

335
00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:06.415
the evolutionary path to the genus Homo, that is

336
00:21:06.425 --> 00:21:11.604
the transition from Aus uh Australopithecus to Homo. Uh

337
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:15.104
And you've done work specifically on the evolution of

338
00:21:15.114 --> 00:21:17.675
the cranium. So, could you tell us about that?

339
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:21.420
What did you find then in terms of these

340
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:27.099
different mechanisms uh that make for a trade to

341
00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:31.959
evolve or to develop? How do they apply here?

342
00:21:31.969 --> 00:21:34.880
I mean, the evolution of the Ukrainian, the uranium

343
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.180
as far as we know, has been mostly the

344
00:21:38.189 --> 00:21:43.250
result of natural selection or any other mechanism that

345
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.790
we talked about here? Yeah. So

346
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.170
um the early part of the human, of human

347
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.680
evolution and the work that I did on that

348
00:21:53.689 --> 00:21:57.390
the Australopithecus leading up to Homo and then uh

349
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.650
later on in the Pleistocene, uh most of that

350
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.510
work was done by um Lauren Schroeder and, and

351
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.000
Becky Ackerman. And I was, I was uh helping

352
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.530
out with some of that. But um later on

353
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.609
when we're talking about human variation today, that's where

354
00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:16.640
my uh expertise is. Yeah, and that's where I've

355
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.089
been focused. Now, I, I talked about brain size

356
00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:23.910
getting bigger and I talked about how natural selection

357
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.739
was probably involved. And I, I mean, probably in

358
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.719
the scientific sense in which I'd be very, very,

359
00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:35.400
very surprised if it wasn't. Um Yeah, but uh

360
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.479
the rest of it, the, the morphology of your

361
00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:42.390
face, uh the morphology of parts of your cranial

362
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.750
base, the which uh the part of your skull,

363
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.130
that breasts on top of your, of your spine.

364
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.369
Um, A lot of that looks to be quite

365
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.449
neutral. That is, it doesn't seem to affect fitness

366
00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:59.670
or hadn't affected fit fitness. And, uh, we know

367
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.790
this for a couple of reasons I mentioned earlier

368
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.069
that there is a nice relationship between genomic variation

369
00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:11.140
and phenotypic variation. If nothing interesting is happening. So

370
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.189
if it's only random genetic drift, then uh we

371
00:23:15.199 --> 00:23:18.640
expect a certain kind of relationship between the phenotypic

372
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.729
variation and the molecular variation genomic variation. And we

373
00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:26.400
see that in human populations today with some exceptions

374
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.739
here and there, you know, there's natural selection is

375
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.810
apparent in some places. What drove that natural selection

376
00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:35.540
is a total mystery. Now, what's interesting about this

377
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:42.030
is that uh human cranial form, outside the outside

378
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.719
brain side has evolved very, very quickly, very high

379
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:52.800
evolutionary rates over longish uh spans of time. And

380
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.000
this is in comparison to other mammals and the

381
00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:01.030
rates themselves look quite neutral. So, uh you know,

382
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.270
uh this is awfully corny. But I'd like to

383
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.170
say if, uh you know, if we're made in

384
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.000
the image of God, then God played dice because

385
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:12.640
most of our, our, our, our visages is uh

386
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.959
sort of cobbled together randomly. And uh this is

387
00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:22.170
not to say that, you know, and um you

388
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.689
know, when I was first proposing this, I, I

389
00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:26.479
was not the first to propose this, but I

390
00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:28.250
was one of the first to link it up

391
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.229
with the genomic variation to bring it along. There

392
00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:33.189
was a lot of pushback because a lot of

393
00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:36.030
people had their adaptation of stories or their stories

394
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.310
about plasticity that they quite liked. And um they

395
00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:44.430
didn't really care for the idea that uh it

396
00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:48.579
was just lots and lots of random changes. So,

397
00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:51.829
um that's, I guess an example, getting back to

398
00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:55.099
the hazards of adaptation is that if you have

399
00:24:55.109 --> 00:24:57.810
tons and tons and tons of anthropologists looking at

400
00:24:57.819 --> 00:25:00.989
very, very few fossils, everybody is going to want

401
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.089
to find something. And it's sort of the, the

402
00:25:04.099 --> 00:25:07.099
worst degrees of freedom problem. You could possibly imagine

403
00:25:07.449 --> 00:25:10.339
um you know, more researchers than there are objects

404
00:25:10.349 --> 00:25:13.489
of study. And uh and that, that can be

405
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.829
j strike in uh in fundamental ways. And I

406
00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:18.089
think that was an example of it.

407
00:25:18.949 --> 00:25:21.650
So at least at this point according to the

408
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.569
best evidence we have and the way you read

409
00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:28.810
it, you would say that uh most of the

410
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:33.459
morphology of our uranium was the result of random

411
00:25:33.469 --> 00:25:40.949
processes and not something like adaptation or phenotypic plasticity

412
00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:41.689
is that it?

413
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.349
Yeah. Yeah. There, there, there are secondary effects of

414
00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:50.079
both adaptation and, and foy plasticity. Um I'd say

415
00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:52.270
that we can say the natural selection happened. I

416
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.750
don't know how adaptive it was. That's a distinction

417
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.880
that we have to bear in mind. Um So,

418
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.640
uh, you know, uh David Cates and Noreen, Von

419
00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:03.900
Kramon Th Bell and a few other people have

420
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.949
done these, uh quite uh interesting studies where they,

421
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:11.650
um take a comparative approach and they're able to

422
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.989
test hypotheses about what happens when you do say

423
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.969
a transition from hunting and gathering to um to,

424
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:24.349
to farming. What happens to the skeleton in that

425
00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:27.479
kind of a context and uh they're able to

426
00:26:27.489 --> 00:26:30.650
do it controlling for the evolutionary history behind it

427
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.609
and you could discover it, they found the effects

428
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:36.349
of plasticity kind of small in comparison to the

429
00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:40.770
old arguments, but they're, they're pretty robust findings because

430
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.050
they're done in this process informed comparative framework.

431
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.219
And so could you tell us about the differences

432
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.479
uh at the level of the cranium between neanderthals

433
00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:58.339
and homo sapiens? What are the main differences we

434
00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:01.500
find there? And, uh, I mean, what kinds of

435
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.699
information can we get from that? Can we get,

436
00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:10.170
for example, any possible information about uh differences in

437
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.380
terms of their brains, for example, or not really?

438
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:16.640
Well. Um

439
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.550
I, I don't know a whole lot about how

440
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.400
to uh recover information about brain structure from, uh

441
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.239
the uh from fossils. And there are certainly people

442
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.430
out there who do it and I, I can't

443
00:27:31.439 --> 00:27:36.719
really comment on it. Uh, um, uh AT a,

444
00:27:36.829 --> 00:27:39.319
at a professional level, what I can say is

445
00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:44.910
that the differences between humans today and neanderthals um

446
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.689
are are largely neutral, uh quite strikingly. So, and

447
00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:55.449
the rate of evolution between uh neanderthals and humans

448
00:27:55.459 --> 00:27:59.510
uh today is the same or give or take

449
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.739
a little tiny bit as the very quick evolution

450
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.479
among different groups of humans today. So we're just

451
00:28:07.489 --> 00:28:11.050
looking at a extension of the same dynamic going

452
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.699
back in time. And um you know, it uh

453
00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:18.579
it's, it, it seems to scale linearly with time.

454
00:28:18.589 --> 00:28:22.609
It's a or properly scaled, it scales linearly with

455
00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:27.530
time. It's a um uh it, it's, it's really

456
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.180
quite fascinating and unusual. So there were lots and

457
00:28:31.189 --> 00:28:35.150
lots and lots of adaptive explanations for uh differences

458
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.819
between neanderthals and humans that had to do with

459
00:28:37.829 --> 00:28:42.050
adaptation to one thing or another or plasticity because

460
00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:46.060
neanderthals uh a characteristic tooth wear that indicates that

461
00:28:46.069 --> 00:28:49.369
they chewed on things maybe s while they were

462
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.699
processing them or something like that. And um yeah,

463
00:28:53.709 --> 00:28:57.439
and the, the, and that made their uh that

464
00:28:57.449 --> 00:29:00.140
made a plastic response to their uh to their

465
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.829
behaviors. Uh I think that a lot of these

466
00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:05.719
stories are, um you know, it's not to say

467
00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:07.420
that they aren't true. Some of them might be,

468
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.560
it's just the evidence for them is, is, is

469
00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:12.189
weakened by quite a bit. Um So a lot

470
00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:14.959
of it looks quite random and I should say

471
00:29:14.969 --> 00:29:18.510
that that is unusual for mammals. Uh Mammals typically

472
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.500
don't have that very rapid evolutionary uh rates that

473
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.030
look like random genetic drift. Over very long periods

474
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.479
of time

475
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.680
and, and do we have any idea why that's

476
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:35.020
the case? I mean, what would have been the

477
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.819
forces or factors playing a role there? Do, do

478
00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:40.319
we know anything about it?

479
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.630
Yeah. Um, WELL, uh, that's a, it's a, it's

480
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.680
a very, very difficult question and, uh, in 20

481
00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:53.280
years of thinking about it, I don't think that

482
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.069
I've come up with a satisfactory answer for it.

483
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.030
Uh, Typically, if you, so if I were to

484
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.020
reach back into the literature, it might be um

485
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:09.969
that there's something about humans uh using technology, tradition,

486
00:30:09.979 --> 00:30:15.569
culture, whatever to uh to modify our environments, such

487
00:30:15.579 --> 00:30:19.089
that we don't end up with um uh with

488
00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:22.420
natural selection, affecting the bodily form nearly as much

489
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.209
as you as you might expect in other organisms.

490
00:30:25.219 --> 00:30:29.030
But that's, I'd, I'd file that under speculation. Um

491
00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:31.579
It's a, it's a little difficult, you know, it's

492
00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:33.949
hard to tell what natural selection is doing when

493
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:37.229
it's doing it. It's hard harder still to say

494
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:42.020
why natural selection isn't doing something. Um So that's

495
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.109
uh the, you know, occasionally we have to be

496
00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:48.670
content with ignorance and, and uh wait for more,

497
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.359
more findings. And I'd, I'd say that's where this

498
00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:52.859
is. Mhm

499
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.550
And another thing we haven't talked about yet here

500
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.119
has to do with gene ex change between species.

501
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:06.410
Uh Yes, something like hybridization occurred a lot during

502
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.969
human evolution. And if so, what do we know

503
00:31:09.979 --> 00:31:14.959
about it? And its potential effects. Yes. So this

504
00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:15.359
is,

505
00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:17.949
uh, something that, uh, Becky Ackerman at the University

506
00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:19.150
of Cape Town has done quite a bit of

507
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.380
work on and the extent to which I've done

508
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.829
work on it has been connected with her work.

509
00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:27.079
And, uh, of course, this is something that is

510
00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:30.390
very popular among the paleo genomics people and they

511
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.079
can address those topics much, much better than I

512
00:31:33.089 --> 00:31:39.619
can. The, um, it's clear that say uh different

513
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:44.930
differentiated groups of humans have hybridized. Um It doesn't

514
00:31:44.939 --> 00:31:48.250
appear to be a gene flow that's sort of

515
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.959
constantly going back and forth between regions uh at

516
00:31:51.969 --> 00:31:54.089
a very low level through time. It seems like

517
00:31:54.099 --> 00:31:59.989
there are episodic uh sort of events in which

518
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.959
hybridization might take place. Now, that's interesting because many

519
00:32:04.969 --> 00:32:08.410
people living today carry with them, a Neanderthal component

520
00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.650
or a denisovan component uh of, of their, of

521
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.180
their genomes. Uh THAT might uh in some cases

522
00:32:15.189 --> 00:32:19.339
have something to do with uh with how they've

523
00:32:19.349 --> 00:32:22.810
been able to adapt to certain environments, uh might

524
00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:25.619
have something to do with your immune function. That

525
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.079
that is uh that sort of thing is very

526
00:32:28.089 --> 00:32:32.550
much in its infancy uh or figuring out exactly

527
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.400
what that does. And one of the reasons why

528
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.770
that's a difficult problem to deal with is that

529
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.400
uh when you deal with organisms that have evolved

530
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.780
separately for a while and then come back together,

531
00:32:46.989 --> 00:32:50.199
you end up with something called heterosis where the

532
00:32:50.209 --> 00:32:54.680
expectation for the hybrid offspring is not sort of

533
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.910
an average of the parents or anything like that.

534
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.920
It's, it's somewhere else. And um that is very,

535
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.449
very difficult to get a handle on because it

536
00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:08.369
involves uh interactions involves uh dominant and recessive uh

537
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.900
effects at, at various losi uh in the genome.

538
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.300
And then what are called epis static effects the

539
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.359
interactions among different parts of the genome. So if

540
00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:21.300
you shuffle up two genomes and throw them together,

541
00:33:21.589 --> 00:33:25.810
you can end up with uh things, changing their

542
00:33:25.819 --> 00:33:30.660
functions in really radical and unpredictable ways. Now, this

543
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.650
is interesting because you, you, you display a whole

544
00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.099
new way of generating variation. And that might be

545
00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:41.900
interesting for our uh for uh telling us about

546
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.349
how organisms are human organisms in the past, uh

547
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.400
did respond to natural selection and how they might

548
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.660
have adapted. But it's um um that, that's a

549
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.920
very difficult problem.

550
00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.260
So, changing topics. Now, I know that you're very

551
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.369
interested and you've written a lot about this uh

552
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.270
very interested in the debate between the so-called hereditary

553
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.458
and the anti hereditary. So, uh I mean, just

554
00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.958
to first frame the debate, could you tell us

555
00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:19.208
what the debate is really about? And what are

556
00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.820
the main points of contention here when it comes

557
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:28.379
to understanding uh differences between human populations or differences

558
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.969
between people that have different ancestries.

559
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.300
So, uh starting with a hereditary position, um I'd

560
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.780
say that the hereditary position is that uh there

561
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.969
are uh biological races of humans. So, race as

562
00:34:46.978 --> 00:34:51.330
we might experience it today is not necessarily a

563
00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.228
uh a, a artifact of a social process. It's,

564
00:34:55.239 --> 00:35:00.919
it, it reflects evolutionary processes over deep time, evolutionary

565
00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:04.540
time. So that's the first thing. Um And you

566
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.100
can organize people into these races based on their

567
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.360
characteristics and ancestry and so on and so forth.

568
00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:12.669
That's the first claim. So the second claim is

569
00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:19.100
that um those groups differ um And uh those,

570
00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.620
uh and the third claim is that those groups

571
00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:26.139
uh differ in ways that are not just environmental,

572
00:35:26.149 --> 00:35:31.899
there is also a evolved genetic component. Two. And

573
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:38.790
um so the uh uh the response to that

574
00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:44.909
is pretty highly varied across uh academia and that

575
00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:47.610
there are certainly social scientists who don't want anything

576
00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.320
to do with genetics. They immediately think it's eugenics

577
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:54.570
and they uh leave the conversation right away. Um

578
00:35:54.939 --> 00:35:58.780
uh I don't uh they tend not to like

579
00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.850
me, not to like me as much as they

580
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.330
uh you know, dislike the hereditary. So, you know,

581
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.830
we're in the same boat together in that, in

582
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.290
a lot of ways. Uh The, the main things

583
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:16.179
boil down to uh are races, biological categories that

584
00:36:16.189 --> 00:36:19.229
is evolved categories that we can attribute to processes

585
00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:24.760
acting over deep time or are they uh social

586
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:28.419
uh constructions in the product of the social dynamics?

587
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.399
And what do differences mean? And what does it

588
00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:35.310
mean to be a genetic difference or an evolved

589
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.100
difference between the two and so this uh uh

590
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:44.689
now I, I study genetic differences between groups of

591
00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:49.000
humans. So, am I hereditary? No. Um The reasons

592
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.929
I'm not a hereditary uh would be that I

593
00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:56.449
don't think that race is a deep evolved biological

594
00:36:56.459 --> 00:37:02.169
feature of humankind. Um And I also think that

595
00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:08.370
the hereditary perspective on genetics relies on a set

596
00:37:08.379 --> 00:37:13.729
of popular misconceptions about what genetics is. So, um

597
00:37:13.739 --> 00:37:16.899
and this, this relates to genetic determinism in one

598
00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:20.350
way or another, uh a very specific flavor of

599
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.429
it where if you see a genetic difference in

600
00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:27.149
one context, that must necessarily mean that it, it,

601
00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:31.169
it, it will manifest itself in all other contexts.

602
00:37:31.629 --> 00:37:35.110
So what this means is that, um you know,

603
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.239
I might say that, OK, well, there's a difference

604
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.679
here. Um Let's say it's something we care about.

605
00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:45.070
Um Let's say that we change the circumstances. We

606
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.070
might end up with a situation in which the

607
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.580
differences are flip flop. We might end up in

608
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.159
a situation where they are uh completely ameliorated, we

609
00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:58.639
don't know. Um WHEREAS a hereditary would say that

610
00:37:58.649 --> 00:38:03.679
these differences are driving the social outcome differences that

611
00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:08.570
we see in society today. And um you know,

612
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.860
so uh I guess that when it comes to

613
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:17.219
the question about biological race and uh and um

614
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:20.929
whether race is a social destruction or not. Um

615
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.169
uh Well, uh I think that, I think that

616
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:27.750
you might have something to ask about that a

617
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.290
little later. So it's uh you just go ahead

618
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:30.439
from

619
00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:33.530
there. Yeah, let me just clarify one point there

620
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.679
when you mentioned genetic determinism. What that means exactly

621
00:38:38.689 --> 00:38:43.649
is that whenever people endorse a view that goes

622
00:38:43.659 --> 00:38:46.989
along, uh or that falls under the umbrella, let's

623
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.159
say of genetic determinism, they are making a claim

624
00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:55.350
that uh a particular trait is the result of

625
00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.739
whatever set of genes and it is mostly or

626
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:06.709
uh completely impermeable to environmental influences is that it,

627
00:39:07.409 --> 00:39:11.969
yeah, in, in sensitivity to changes in environmental context.

628
00:39:11.979 --> 00:39:16.649
So and the uh and then as a set

629
00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:20.139
of it's, it's a very diffuse type of thing.

630
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:25.340
Um uh AND uh it, the lack of clarity

631
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.780
uh leaves a lot of room for mischief, but

632
00:39:27.939 --> 00:39:29.419
that's, that's the core of it.

633
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.879
So also perhaps to illustrate these, uh of course,

634
00:39:34.889 --> 00:39:38.110
there are many trades out there that people make

635
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.229
claims about threats where uh I mean, some of

636
00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:45.939
them are clear differences that we find between people

637
00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:49.909
of different ancestries, others are disputed. And of course,

638
00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:52.439
one of the most disputed ones has to do

639
00:39:52.449 --> 00:39:57.560
with intelligence and IQ. So uh there are people,

640
00:39:57.635 --> 00:40:04.334
people that argue very strongly for IQ being mostly

641
00:40:04.344 --> 00:40:11.254
genetically determined and for uh clear differences in IQ

642
00:40:11.264 --> 00:40:16.844
between different races, for example, between whites and blacks

643
00:40:16.854 --> 00:40:21.745
in America, between Jews and Europeans, between Jews and

644
00:40:21.754 --> 00:40:26.270
East Asians, et cetera, et cetera. So, what do

645
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.120
you make of that, I mean, because the, there

646
00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:32.469
are several different aspects to this argument that we

647
00:40:32.479 --> 00:40:36.439
can tackle it. But generally speaking, what do you

648
00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:40.250
make of, uh, the arguments put forth by people

649
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.610
who argue that first of all IQ is mostly

650
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:52.050
genetically based and second that differences in IQ between,

651
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:57.570
uh, human groups or population are mostly explained by

652
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.679
genetic differences.

653
00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:03.540
Yeah. So, um, the first thing that I'd say

654
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.439
is that they're, they're really not doing any research

655
00:41:06.449 --> 00:41:10.800
into that front that they come at you with

656
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:16.800
tables of numbers and, you know, they're relying on,

657
00:41:17.209 --> 00:41:21.729
uh, a, uh, I shouldn't say they're relying on,

658
00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:26.229
uh, the, the arguments get shaped by people's impressions

659
00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:30.709
of what's being delivered to them. And, uh for

660
00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:34.469
instance, there's lots of arguments about her heritability, which

661
00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:38.570
is the proportion of uh variation in a population

662
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.770
with respect to a trait that is attributable to

663
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.760
genetic effects as opposed to environmental effects. And heritability

664
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:50.020
just doesn't tell you anything in and of itself

665
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:54.620
about how uh malleable or plastic a trait might

666
00:41:54.629 --> 00:41:58.820
be. Ok. So, it just did, you know, you,

667
00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.860
we could write the math out and there's just

668
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:05.600
absolutely nothing there. The within group heritability doesn't tell

669
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:09.639
you anything about the, between group heritability unless you

670
00:42:09.649 --> 00:42:14.739
add in some actual evolutionary theory that tells you

671
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:18.939
how you got the differences between the groups in

672
00:42:18.949 --> 00:42:23.610
the first place. Now, hereditary ins don't do that.

673
00:42:24.489 --> 00:42:29.810
They, uh will, uh, they don't have the evolutionary

674
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:34.909
component to that argument. So they can't tell me

675
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.659
how, um how strong natural selection is, was when

676
00:42:39.899 --> 00:42:42.000
they can't tell me any of these types of

677
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.520
things. We're not proposing any evolutionary argument. They're just

678
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.419
saying these numbers are different now. Uh And that's

679
00:42:50.429 --> 00:42:52.899
true. The number 100 is different from the number

680
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:58.000
85 but that's not terribly interesting. So, towards the

681
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.219
beginning of our discussion, I talked about how you

682
00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:05.050
really need to know the organism and um educational

683
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.199
attainment and uh cognitive ability. IQ whatever you want

684
00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:12.350
to talk about it behaves very strangely as a

685
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.060
complex trait. Now that we've had genome wide association

686
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.760
studies coming in. Uh It's the, the uh the

687
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:25.360
difference between the estimates of the effective genetics from

688
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.090
the genome wide association studies where you just go

689
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.500
through and count up everything that looks like it

690
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.820
has an effect on the trait, compile them. And

691
00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:36.129
uh you come up with a summary statistic of

692
00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:40.090
how much variation you can account for. Um uh

693
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.189
THAT tends to be very small, especially when you

694
00:43:43.409 --> 00:43:48.370
get rid statistically control for a lot of the

695
00:43:48.379 --> 00:43:53.080
tendency for uh different things to be inherited together

696
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:58.080
in humans that aren't strictly speaking inheritable. So your

697
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:03.149
economic situation, your uh uh what hap what area

698
00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:06.149
you happen to live in, uh what your family

699
00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:07.739
is like and so on and so forth. It's

700
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:12.989
very, very attenuated. Um And it's rather different than

701
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.330
looking at something like height or something like, uh,

702
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.179
uh even body mass or something like that is

703
00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:23.520
something very different going on. And the hereditary seem

704
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:27.889
to be wedded to their old twin estimates which,

705
00:44:28.219 --> 00:44:32.389
you know, uh people in evolutionary biology don't take

706
00:44:32.399 --> 00:44:36.320
very seriously and we, we tend not to use

707
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.939
mostly because a lot of organisms don't display twins.

708
00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:41.959
But even in cattle where you do have regular

709
00:44:41.969 --> 00:44:44.689
twinning, people don't go out of their way to

710
00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:48.760
find the twins because they know that the estimates

711
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.120
tend to be bad. That is the estimates of

712
00:44:51.129 --> 00:44:54.810
the effects of, of genes on variation that you

713
00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:00.669
get from comparing twins or, or just upwardly biased

714
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:06.260
in a big way. Ok. So, um so what

715
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.959
I say is that uh the hereditary ins claim

716
00:45:09.969 --> 00:45:15.040
that they're arguing for, they're making an evolutionary argument

717
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.300
for differences among groups, but there's no evolution there,

718
00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.260
the genetics are pointed in the wrong direction. They're

719
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.860
not looking at the right issuess. Uh It really

720
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.760
is a just a collection of summary statistics of

721
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.780
dubious quality that uh they get thrown out there.

722
00:45:34.409 --> 00:45:38.939
And um you know, the between group heritability versus

723
00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:42.570
within group heritability discussion is a prime example that

724
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.570
um there, there's no relationship between those two quantities

725
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.070
unless you add in some evolutionary theory, which the

726
00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.540
hereditary ins refuse to do. And hereditary ins like

727
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.469
to use between group heritability and within group heritability

728
00:45:57.479 --> 00:46:01.179
to figure out how plausible a difference between groups

729
00:46:01.189 --> 00:46:04.540
might be if it were entirely environmental and there's

730
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.080
a pretty basic algebra errors in it and it

731
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.000
just keeps on going through the literature. So, um,

732
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.810
the, you know, the main problem with hereditary is,

733
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.379
is not that, uh, you know, the other problems

734
00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:20.840
with it, but when we speak about it scientifically,

735
00:46:21.229 --> 00:46:24.250
uh is that it's just not there, they're not

736
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:29.419
making the relevant arguments. They're not producing science that

737
00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:32.530
we would, uh, that we would understand as being

738
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.800
informed by modern evolutionary biology. Um Now, with their

739
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.860
motivations are their own, I don't, I don't read

740
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:44.040
minds. I, I don't pretend to uh be able

741
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.050
to peer into the, their souls or that sort

742
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.530
of thing. I can say that they're not doing

743
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.570
the science that they claim to be doing.

744
00:46:51.659 --> 00:46:54.100
And, and I, I mean, if you will allow

745
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.199
me and uh uh please uh comment on what

746
00:46:57.209 --> 00:46:59.030
I'm about to say. I mean, even when it

747
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.760
comes to just the science because of course, let's

748
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.969
try to leave motivations and politics aside here just

749
00:47:05.979 --> 00:47:10.199
focusing on the science, even when it comes to

750
00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:14.969
uh trying to, I, I mean, extrapolate from within

751
00:47:14.979 --> 00:47:20.570
group heritability to between group heritability, even if someone

752
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.510
takes uh very seriously, for example, the work done

753
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.030
in behavioral genetics when it comes to studying twins,

754
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.699
adopted kids, adopted people, et cetera. Uh I mean,

755
00:47:33.709 --> 00:47:38.620
even the behavioral geneticists themselves say, and I know

756
00:47:38.629 --> 00:47:41.389
this because I've talked with people like Robert plumbing

757
00:47:41.409 --> 00:47:44.300
for the show and others, they say that uh

758
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:49.550
their methodologies, the work they do does not allow

759
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.790
for someone to act to do that kind of

760
00:47:52.800 --> 00:48:00.125
extrapolation. I mean, they're studying within group heritability within

761
00:48:00.135 --> 00:48:03.775
group differences between people that are part of the

762
00:48:03.785 --> 00:48:07.156
group. They're studying in a particular environment. They uh

763
00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:10.065
they, for example, Robert Loman told me that, for

764
00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:14.016
example, it doesn't allow for us to really study

765
00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:18.652
very well, differences between men and women, between different

766
00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:22.062
groups of people, between different races if you want.

767
00:48:22.072 --> 00:48:26.402
And also when it comes to the databases, many

768
00:48:26.412 --> 00:48:31.812
times, hereditary point to when talking about or making

769
00:48:31.822 --> 00:48:36.699
claims about differences in IQ between uh people from

770
00:48:36.709 --> 00:48:39.939
Africa and people from Europe. Just to give an

771
00:48:39.949 --> 00:48:45.419
example, those databases are extremely poor and they are

772
00:48:45.429 --> 00:48:51.500
based on an extremely small sample. And I would

773
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:55.840
add convenient sample, convenient for the narrative that they

774
00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.379
are putting forth uh particularly when it comes to

775
00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:04.250
the samples from Africa. I mean, they are extremely

776
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.800
limited and extremely small number of people and we

777
00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:15.520
can't really tell anything from those data. Scientific. Right.

778
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.000
Yeah. And uh behavioral, the point about the behavioral

779
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.969
genetics is is important in that um there's really

780
00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:27.989
nothing evolutionary about behavioral genetics as it's practiced. Uh

781
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.209
This may sound a little strange but um you

782
00:49:31.219 --> 00:49:38.110
need the extra theoretical evolutionary component to relate within

783
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.959
group heritability to between group heritability. And that's simply

784
00:49:42.969 --> 00:49:46.570
not appearing either in behavioral genetics because it's not

785
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.389
really the point of the field, it's not appearing

786
00:49:49.399 --> 00:49:52.659
in the hereditary literature because they don't appear to

787
00:49:52.669 --> 00:49:56.949
be all that interested in, in evolution. So. Mhm.

788
00:49:57.689 --> 00:50:00.110
And then another thing that I read about in

789
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.419
your work and now focusing more on the anti

790
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.830
reds, you say in one of your papers that

791
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.600
uh they bring to the table arguments based on

792
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:16.340
complexity and a demand for a mechanistic as opposed

793
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:21.820
to variational explanations. Could, could you explain uh the

794
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.419
argument you're making there and why that might be

795
00:50:25.459 --> 00:50:29.540
an issue that they're using those kinds of arguments?

796
00:50:30.439 --> 00:50:35.350
Yes. So, um, anti hereditary are against hereditary is,

797
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.280
um uh that's about all that unifies anti hereditary.

798
00:50:40.419 --> 00:50:42.050
Uh There were lots and lots and lots of

799
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:48.379
different flavors. So, um there, uh and that I,

800
00:50:48.389 --> 00:50:51.090
I the paper is not about sort of groups

801
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.459
of her. It's anti hereditary. It's more about the

802
00:50:54.469 --> 00:50:58.689
different flavors of argument that I find objectionable. Um

803
00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:05.399
And uh in terms of the wanting a causal

804
00:51:05.409 --> 00:51:09.530
mechanistic explanation of what's going on. They usually mean

805
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.100
they want to know what genes are involved and

806
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.229
they want to know what the protein products of

807
00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.870
those genes are doing and what the metabolism is,

808
00:51:18.879 --> 00:51:21.760
is doing and so on and so forth. And,

809
00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:26.709
um uh that's sort of, besides the point because

810
00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:29.649
we, um just as a matter of fact, we

811
00:51:29.659 --> 00:51:32.870
can do quite a bit of evolution without knowing

812
00:51:32.879 --> 00:51:36.229
the, uh or you can do a lot of

813
00:51:36.239 --> 00:51:42.060
evolutionary biology without knowing the uh uh the mechanistic

814
00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.810
basics, we can use quantitative genetics. We can use

815
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:49.899
those elegant simplicities that come out of the bewildering

816
00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:54.570
complexity of the genotype phenotype map. It's, you know,

817
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.320
and uh this is where a lot of statistics

818
00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.719
come from in the first place, you know, you

819
00:51:59.729 --> 00:52:02.010
have to do it very, very carefully. That's true.

820
00:52:02.399 --> 00:52:05.550
Uh Now, what's interesting about this is that, that

821
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.719
demand for mechanism, that demand for uh this very

822
00:52:10.729 --> 00:52:15.419
highly reduced account of what is going on is

823
00:52:15.429 --> 00:52:20.250
kind of a uh expression of, of the bad

824
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.729
habit that they attribute to hereditary. Its, they call

825
00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:27.330
them reductionist, they call them determinist. And what they're

826
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.669
doing is they're saying, yes, we agree with you

827
00:52:30.679 --> 00:52:34.489
that genetics is deterministic and reductionistic. We agree with

828
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.790
hereditary ins on that. Uh And we want more

829
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.149
of it. We just don't have enough of it.

830
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:47.179
And so, you know, the, the correct answer for,

831
00:52:47.409 --> 00:52:51.379
uh when somebody says some characteristic is uh exh

832
00:52:51.389 --> 00:52:55.050
heritable. And I'm going to talk about the social

833
00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:59.080
poli, political, social and political ramifications of that is

834
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.139
to say, you know, you, you're dealing with the

835
00:53:02.149 --> 00:53:05.290
wrong statistic. That's not gonna tell you anything. It's

836
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.889
not to say I want to see the genes

837
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.050
because that goes that, that is a validation of

838
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.080
the same kind of determinism and reductionism that anti

839
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.659
hereditary ins complain about in hereditary complexity is another

840
00:53:18.669 --> 00:53:23.179
thing. Um I think I mentioned at the beginning

841
00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:27.919
of a discussion that uh complexity is a, is

842
00:53:27.929 --> 00:53:32.379
awfully convenient, uh, rhetorical trick to hide behind. And

843
00:53:32.389 --> 00:53:35.459
that you, you can say just about anything is,

844
00:53:35.469 --> 00:53:40.479
is bafflingly complex. And people seem to like to

845
00:53:40.489 --> 00:53:43.100
hear that that's, that plays well with a certain

846
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:47.979
kind of audience. Um It really explains nothing and

847
00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:51.850
uh if you know, if it's, you know, if

848
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.310
it's complex is the answer, you know, what's the

849
00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.010
question? And at a practical level, uh to tell

850
00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:04.469
that something is complex, takes quite a lot of

851
00:54:04.479 --> 00:54:07.229
data sometimes and those are data that we just

852
00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:10.790
don't have in a lot of con context. Um,

853
00:54:10.939 --> 00:54:12.830
YOU need to be able to find some signal

854
00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.379
in a system that looks very noisy. And this

855
00:54:16.389 --> 00:54:18.879
is one of the problems is that if you

856
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:23.020
don't have that variational sense going in, you don't

857
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:28.070
have that statistical sense, you can take any random

858
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.820
set of data and concoct a very, very convincing

859
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:38.189
story about it. And we, um, lots and lots

860
00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:42.260
of stories about how people, uh get, uh sucked

861
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.580
into gambling addictions and so on and so forth

862
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.600
because they're absolutely convinced that they have a system,

863
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:51.189
they see through the complexity, they can apprehend it

864
00:54:51.199 --> 00:54:53.540
and they can manipulate it and they are absolutely

865
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.919
wrong. So it's a kind of a dangerous rhetorical

866
00:54:57.929 --> 00:55:03.689
device because on one hand you, uh you, uh,

867
00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:10.060
it, it, you, you're saying somehow, uh, well, we

868
00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.540
can't really know what's going on. Uh, BUT I

869
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:16.899
can see that something that somebody else can't, it's,

870
00:55:16.909 --> 00:55:21.189
it's a, it turns you into an oracle and

871
00:55:21.379 --> 00:55:24.530
people tend to tend to be attracted to that

872
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.340
when they're charismatic enough and so on and so

873
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:29.370
forth. But, um, it really doesn't explain a whole

874
00:55:29.379 --> 00:55:34.939
lot and it comes with the danger of telling

875
00:55:34.949 --> 00:55:40.419
stories about noise to that. Those would be the,

876
00:55:40.429 --> 00:55:44.260
my complaints and, you know, II I think that

877
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:46.889
one of the problems with anti hereditary is, is

878
00:55:46.899 --> 00:55:50.379
both a tendency to say everything is complex to

879
00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:53.810
the point where uh you can't have a theory

880
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:58.939
about anything. Theories involve simplifications, theories involve abstractions, they

881
00:55:58.949 --> 00:56:04.719
evolve, involve generalizations. Um And if everything is so

882
00:56:04.729 --> 00:56:07.739
complex that you can't have any of those, you

883
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.909
have no theory, you don't have the possibility of

884
00:56:09.919 --> 00:56:14.739
science. And uh and it's, it just seems to

885
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:19.610
be a uh uh it, it's a non answers

886
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.889
to a non question. It's just a, it's just

887
00:56:22.899 --> 00:56:25.959
a statement for statements sake, a rhetorical trick.

888
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.729
Mhm So uh just to ask you about this

889
00:56:29.739 --> 00:56:34.399
point directly, how do you think we should think

890
00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:39.320
about the role of genes and their potential causal

891
00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:45.560
power when it comes to uh understanding differences between

892
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.209
human population?

893
00:56:48.899 --> 00:56:54.350
So uh in terms of their causal power? Well,

894
00:56:54.899 --> 00:56:57.320
so the first thing to remember is that genes

895
00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:02.810
are parts of organisms. And um we want to

896
00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.300
get to know the organism as, as biologists as

897
00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:09.739
anthropologists, as social scientists or humanists in general. And

898
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:14.179
we need to have some sense about what the

899
00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:17.540
context in which those genes are operating is like.

900
00:57:18.679 --> 00:57:24.060
Um And what we can say is that care

901
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:28.530
in carefully controlled settings uh where we have the,

902
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:34.250
the right uh study design, they're, they're usually epidemiological

903
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.610
rather than experimental. And if they're experimental in humans,

904
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.439
you probably shouldn't be doing them. Um You have

905
00:57:43.449 --> 00:57:47.370
a uh you can come up to the conclusion

906
00:57:47.379 --> 00:57:52.000
that substituting this very variant of the gene for

907
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:56.370
another in this context will cause this change. All

908
00:57:56.379 --> 00:57:58.510
right. So, and this goes back to R A

909
00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.050
Fisher's uh idea of causation. What happens if not,

910
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:07.909
what happens under the counterfactual situation. Now, the problem

911
00:58:07.919 --> 00:58:10.919
is is that we don't know what the organism

912
00:58:10.929 --> 00:58:15.629
is like across all sorts of uh the uh

913
00:58:15.649 --> 00:58:19.669
uh all sorts of the of possible environments in

914
00:58:19.679 --> 00:58:23.040
which you could find yourself. And a really good

915
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:26.540
example of this is uh the use of genomics

916
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:31.270
for medical purposes. The whole point of that is

917
00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.969
to basically people look for drug targets. They're looking

918
00:58:34.979 --> 00:58:37.169
for things that they can add a chemical to

919
00:58:37.179 --> 00:58:39.270
you and they will, they will fix you and

920
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.080
then probably make a whole bunch of side effects

921
00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:44.739
that they can make drugs to treat. It's a,

922
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:48.510
it's a, it's a great business model. Um But

923
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.070
the uh you know, the, the whole point behind

924
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:59.090
uh genomics, pharmacogenomics medical genomics is to use properties

925
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:03.370
of the organisms to find environments. That is a

926
00:59:03.379 --> 00:59:08.209
new chemical that you ingest to change a life

927
00:59:08.219 --> 00:59:14.050
outcome. So it's a search for environmental possibility. It's

928
00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:18.659
not a statement about genetic determination and the way

929
00:59:18.669 --> 00:59:20.610
that I take that is that if we're interested

930
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.780
in other characteristics that uh you know, behavioral characteristics

931
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:31.120
or morphological characteristics, um we really need to have

932
00:59:31.129 --> 00:59:33.689
a sense of what the organism might do in

933
00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:38.780
other circumstances. And humans have a bad track record

934
00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:43.330
of, of conforming to our expectations. So, um I

935
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:47.750
would say that it's very, very difficult beyond certain

936
00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.169
well known systems to say what will happen. You

937
00:59:52.179 --> 00:59:54.750
know, if you completely lack a re uh the

938
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.209
ability to digest something past a certain age, you

939
00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:01.050
know, the lactose and uh val absorption and into

940
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:07.929
adulthood or the lactase persistence into adulthood. Um Then,

941
01:00:08.199 --> 01:00:11.110
you know, you have a pretty good idea of

942
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.050
what environments in which you might face problems if

943
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.120
you don't produce lactase as an adult, that is

944
01:00:17.129 --> 01:00:21.649
the enzyme that breaks down lactose. Um And you

945
01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:24.850
also know what to do about it with cultural

946
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:30.090
innovations, like uh a um a pill with a,

947
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:35.169
a bunch of enzymes in it. So, um the

948
01:00:35.179 --> 01:00:40.179
uh it's, it's very, very difficult to go from

949
01:00:40.389 --> 01:00:44.260
a uh very general property of an organism to

950
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.040
a statement about what they're going to do in,

951
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.340
in general. Now, this is not to say, you

952
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:50.649
know, you that there are going to be very,

953
01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:53.570
very general things that you need to uh be,

954
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.550
be aware of. We need water, we need proper

955
01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.669
shelter. Can't be too hot, can't be too cold,

956
01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:02.149
so on and so forth. Um But those are

957
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:06.030
very generic properties of organisms that are tailored a

958
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.149
little bit to humans but not so much. Um

959
01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:15.639
So it's extremely difficult to say that um there's

960
01:01:15.649 --> 01:01:18.040
a uh that there are genetic differences in the

961
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.709
first place. Then it's very difficult to find the

962
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.949
causal mechanisms. It's very difficult to predict what they're

963
01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:29.050
going to do across context. So at that point,

964
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.840
um you know, you can have an evolved difference

965
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:35.070
between two groups and you can change the environment

966
01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:39.070
and then that might completely reorder or entirely disappear.

967
01:01:39.959 --> 01:01:45.600
So that is something that you're uh that it's

968
01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:48.649
a, is a profound challenge for all of biology

969
01:01:48.659 --> 01:01:52.320
and anthropology and it's not something that you get

970
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:55.620
at with heritage estimates or even GW, it's quite

971
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.429
a bit more going on. Sorry for the vague

972
01:01:58.439 --> 01:01:59.429
answer. That was

973
01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.750
uh no, no, no, no, no worries at all.

974
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.800
I, I was just going to say, I, and

975
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:07.429
I guess that probably this point would also apply

976
01:02:07.439 --> 01:02:12.139
to the medical field, isn't, isn't it also? I

977
01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:15.030
mean, a little bit limiting and perhaps in a

978
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.260
sense worrying that many times we are making some

979
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:23.030
influences when it comes to, for example, thinking about

980
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.729
races just on the basis of uh skin color.

981
01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:30.885
I mean, because for example, in the medical field,

982
01:02:30.895 --> 01:02:34.645
I know that there are populations in Africa where

983
01:02:34.655 --> 01:02:40.205
people are more susceptible to developing fals form anemia.

984
01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:44.995
But, uh, ii, I mean, if you're assuming, for

985
01:02:45.004 --> 01:02:47.985
example, in the medical field that just because someone

986
01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:51.449
has a, a darker skin color that they have

987
01:02:51.459 --> 01:02:57.479
some African ancestry, that they would be more, potentially

988
01:02:57.489 --> 01:03:00.679
more susceptible to that kind of disease. I mean,

989
01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:04.290
you, you might miss, uh, a lot in terms

990
01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:10.189
of diagnosis because the skin color itself does just

991
01:03:10.199 --> 01:03:13.689
by itself doesn't tell you much about even the

992
01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:19.939
subpopulation in Africa where the ancestry of that person

993
01:03:19.949 --> 01:03:22.949
might have come from. Right. I, I mean, does

994
01:03:22.959 --> 01:03:24.189
this make sense or?

995
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.860
Yes. Yeah. So, um, this, uh, using race as

996
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:33.199
a diagnostic category, ha in medicine as a, uh,

997
01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:37.969
uh, a long and not, not terribly useful history,

998
01:03:37.979 --> 01:03:40.899
uh, it's, uh, you know, oftentimes quite shocking what

999
01:03:40.909 --> 01:03:46.149
happens and, um, and the point there that you're

1000
01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:53.449
making, uh, is that, uh, uh, the, the correlations

1001
01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:58.129
between different characteristics at different levels may be different.

1002
01:03:58.139 --> 01:04:00.929
So, at the worldwide level, it may be quite

1003
01:04:00.939 --> 01:04:02.860
different than it is at the local level. You

1004
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:06.459
know, Simpsons paradox, that sort of thing. And, uh,

1005
01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:11.659
they're very seldom good enough to have a very

1006
01:04:11.669 --> 01:04:16.389
strong indicator of what based on one property of

1007
01:04:16.399 --> 01:04:20.260
an individual, what else they might be, uh, might,

1008
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.699
might be likely to present as a symptom or

1009
01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:26.060
as a as a susceptibility or, or something along

1010
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:32.189
those lines. So, yeah, um that is a um

1011
01:04:32.719 --> 01:04:37.639
it's a persistent worry. Um And this is kind

1012
01:04:37.649 --> 01:04:42.520
of where the difficulty with uh talking about uh

1013
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.250
either race as an evolved category or race as

1014
01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:51.659
a social construct comes into things because um race

1015
01:04:51.669 --> 01:04:55.080
is a social construction. Uh That's not a very

1016
01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.949
informative thing. It's kind of like saying adaptation comes

1017
01:04:58.959 --> 01:05:03.080
from natural selection. It's a such a broad explanatory

1018
01:05:03.429 --> 01:05:06.719
uh uh tool that it, you know, you really

1019
01:05:06.729 --> 01:05:09.300
need to refine it. So the question I like

1020
01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:12.870
to approach is uh I, I like to say

1021
01:05:12.879 --> 01:05:17.360
that, well, you know, uh race as, as we

1022
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:21.709
understand, it isn't a terribly uh it isn't a

1023
01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:25.669
deep evolutionary phenomenon. We know that because race models

1024
01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:29.750
don't predict human variation at all. Well, um so

1025
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.520
a lot of the principal components analysis plots that

1026
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.830
you see floating around on the internet where you've

1027
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:40.530
got brightly colored patches of, of peoples. Um uh

1028
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.820
The, the, you know, the problem with principal components

1029
01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:45.310
analysis is that it's not an analysis, it's a

1030
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.310
depiction and people are just sort of painting race

1031
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.110
onto it as they see fit. Um And you'll

1032
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.409
see clustering algorithms going around. Well, it turns out

1033
01:05:54.419 --> 01:05:58.439
that they miss so much of the variation even

1034
01:05:58.449 --> 01:06:04.489
between groups that uh that you need much better

1035
01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.370
uh models that don't include race that include much

1036
01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:12.989
more complex structures. And I could say complex legitimately

1037
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.629
because we have the data and to test with

1038
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:20.719
the complexity and we, we can see that. Um

1039
01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:25.209
SO racism doesn't explain the evolution of humans. We

1040
01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:29.020
cannot say that uh humans come in these deep

1041
01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:34.379
evolved races. Mhm Talk about today. Well, race is

1042
01:06:34.389 --> 01:06:37.879
a very real part of our everyday experiences in

1043
01:06:37.889 --> 01:06:42.899
United States. Um Certainly in, in Portugal and uh

1044
01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:47.149
your experience in in Portugal and my experience in

1045
01:06:47.159 --> 01:06:50.719
the United States are going to be rather different.

1046
01:06:50.729 --> 01:06:52.699
They are going to be some commonalities that's for

1047
01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.419
certain. But who gets counted as what and how

1048
01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:58.350
the dynamic works out can be very different? Mhm

1049
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.149
Bye bye. Now, the question then becomes uh if

1050
01:07:04.429 --> 01:07:08.560
races are social constructions and they're driven by uh

1051
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:12.300
these political processes, if racism is what's sort of

1052
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:16.149
shaping and, and reinforcing them, why do you see

1053
01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:20.570
genetic differences between groups? So I, I'd like to

1054
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.520
ask it's very simple answer. Uh OR very, very

1055
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:27.870
simple question I should say. Um uh Where did,

1056
01:07:27.879 --> 01:07:29.110
where did you get your jeans?

1057
01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:35.689
Where did I get my gym? I guess that

1058
01:07:35.699 --> 01:07:37.090
from my parents,

1059
01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:41.310
right. Great. OK. Yeah, perfect. Where did you get

1060
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:41.909
your parents

1061
01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:44.840
from? My grandparents?

1062
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.090
Well, not really. They, they kind of had to

1063
01:07:49.379 --> 01:07:54.389
go through a social milieu to end up meeting

1064
01:07:54.399 --> 01:07:55.330
and then producing

1065
01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.020
it. Uh Yeah. Yeah, that

1066
01:07:58.419 --> 01:08:02.689
and you know, uh there are lots of social

1067
01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:06.919
factors that go into that. So, you know, uh

1068
01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:12.169
and that is one of the things that uh

1069
01:08:12.179 --> 01:08:14.889
one of the ways in which you do get

1070
01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:19.549
obvious genetic differences between groups of humans that we

1071
01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.240
call races that are social constructions. So the way

1072
01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.390
I like to put it is that um you

1073
01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:30.540
know, the genome, you know, a collection of genes

1074
01:08:30.549 --> 01:08:34.180
that typifies any organism that's not a social construction,

1075
01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:39.379
but my genome and your genome are quite literally

1076
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:43.740
social constructions because of the ways in which parents

1077
01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:50.600
need to reproduce. So, um if uh the what

1078
01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:53.720
this does is this way of thinking about things

1079
01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.359
and this is not original to me, Ashley Montague,

1080
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:58.810
who's a anthropologist, talked about this a whole bunch

1081
01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.620
of people a long time ago whose work has

1082
01:09:01.629 --> 01:09:05.180
been forgotten about, talk about this. But the very

1083
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:10.419
act of reproduction in a society is heavily influenced

1084
01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:14.790
by various social dynamics. Racism is one of them,

1085
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:18.200
class is a big deal in terms of who,

1086
01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:20.529
who gets to marry one another. So, so the

1087
01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:25.799
very act of reproduction in humans is socially mediated

1088
01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:29.990
in important ways by race and racism by class

1089
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:33.580
and uh class snobbery and, and various things like

1090
01:09:33.589 --> 01:09:37.278
that. So you end up with a situation where

1091
01:09:37.618 --> 01:09:39.957
uh we have to think about the ways in

1092
01:09:39.969 --> 01:09:45.188
which our histories as a uh as, as, as

1093
01:09:45.198 --> 01:09:48.749
societies, not just our prehistory uh as, as human

1094
01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:54.680
beings uh or as organisms um shape the variation

1095
01:09:54.689 --> 01:09:58.000
that we see in societies. And that's a, that's

1096
01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:00.109
a little bit unsettling for people in a lot

1097
01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.899
of ways. But, um, and I don't think that

1098
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:06.259
we really know how to talk about that. Uh,

1099
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:09.000
VERY well. There are some social scientists who are

1100
01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:12.129
starting to talk about it and, um, they'd be

1101
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.140
much better at it than I would, uh, my,

1102
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:17.410
my ability to deal with some of the subtleties

1103
01:10:17.419 --> 01:10:21.669
and nuances, uh, limited and, um, I'm certainly not

1104
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.970
a historian. So, uh, but this is one of

1105
01:10:25.979 --> 01:10:31.319
the problems with the humanity scientific divide so much

1106
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.229
pushback against anything that mentions genetics in the humanities.

1107
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.660
And people in the sciences tend to look down

1108
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:42.680
on the, on the uh humanities uh in ways

1109
01:10:42.689 --> 01:10:46.740
that are, you know, uh sort of mean and,

1110
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.470
and not at all productive, but that we want

1111
01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.649
to understand it. That's what we have to, that's

1112
01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:52.859
what we have to understand.

1113
01:10:53.899 --> 01:10:57.399
So, uh uh I mean, just to close off

1114
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:01.879
the section on uh the topic of race. So

1115
01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:05.439
would you say then that race, even though it

1116
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:09.990
is not a scientifically valued concept from the perspective

1117
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.330
of genetics, biology and anthropology, if we're talking about

1118
01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:20.330
humans, of course, it is um something that we

1119
01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:24.220
can talk about scientifically, I guess from uh from

1120
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:28.910
the perspective of sociology, cultural anthropology and other disciplines

1121
01:11:28.919 --> 01:11:33.919
like that, because it's very much a social category

1122
01:11:33.959 --> 01:11:38.674
that we use across the societies and that clearly

1123
01:11:38.685 --> 01:11:44.464
has a real effect on people's uh sociality, how

1124
01:11:44.475 --> 01:11:48.995
we relate to one another. There sometimes uh even

1125
01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:52.064
effects on their, on how they reproduce with whom

1126
01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:54.725
they reproduce and, and so on. Right. So it

1127
01:11:54.734 --> 01:11:59.984
is a scientifically valid concept. But uh when approached

1128
01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:00.904
this way,

1129
01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:04.319
yeah, I, I would say that we need a

1130
01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:07.640
new way of doing science to approach it. The

1131
01:12:07.649 --> 01:12:10.919
way science got set up means that this kind

1132
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:13.319
of fall the the issue falls into the cracks,

1133
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:18.649
the issue of human organisms as social beings uh

1134
01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.520
is very, very difficult to get across. And you

1135
01:12:22.529 --> 01:12:25.020
know, there are whole swans of the humanities who

1136
01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:28.600
will talk about bodies, but they're not talking about

1137
01:12:28.609 --> 01:12:33.200
actual bodies. It's a very abstract notion, the actual

1138
01:12:33.729 --> 01:12:40.569
uh body that to, you know, manifest hunger and

1139
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:45.180
desire and, and pain and whatnot doesn't seem to

1140
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:50.470
enter into the discourse on bodies. And then you

1141
01:12:50.479 --> 01:12:53.770
end up with uh the sciences who kind of

1142
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:56.149
ignore a lot of the messiness of, of, of

1143
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.379
society. So a new kind of science needs to

1144
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:02.209
be developed to deal with that. And it's the

1145
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.899
type of thing where uh disciplines as they evolved

1146
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.810
in in academia just aren't well suited to doing

1147
01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:09.950
it.

1148
01:13:10.609 --> 01:13:15.129
Mhm So of course, when we earlier talked about

1149
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:20.790
the hereditary, we mentioned things like uh in intelligence

1150
01:13:20.799 --> 01:13:24.160
like you and we were focusing mostly and that's

1151
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:27.370
also uh also the, the reason for that is

1152
01:13:27.379 --> 01:13:29.729
the fact that many times they also tend to

1153
01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:34.919
focus on more psychological behavioral traits than really uh

1154
01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:38.970
more anatomical physical traits. But when it comes to

1155
01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:42.850
body form, what do we know about the main

1156
01:13:42.859 --> 01:13:47.310
factors that play a role in its variation among

1157
01:13:47.319 --> 01:13:48.799
human populations?

1158
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.770
Um Not nearly as much as we think we

1159
01:13:51.779 --> 01:13:56.169
did. So, uh I, I think that if we're

1160
01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:00.779
dealing with uh issues of um what I'll call

1161
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:04.259
the body form composition or body composition, um The

1162
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:07.549
things that go along with the rules that are

1163
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:12.459
supposed to uh match mammals to their environments based

1164
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:16.709
on how the prevailing temperature. So Bergman's law and

1165
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.350
Alan's Law having to do with how sort of

1166
01:14:19.359 --> 01:14:21.740
big and round you are. Um YOU know, or

1167
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:24.040
how, how long your limbs are and things like

1168
01:14:24.049 --> 01:14:28.500
that. Um Now, in humans, you do see a

1169
01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:31.470
bit of that. Uh It's quite a bit of,

1170
01:14:31.479 --> 01:14:35.290
it is not attributable to natural selection. Uh So

1171
01:14:35.299 --> 01:14:37.939
it doesn't appear to be an adaptation. Uh There

1172
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:41.919
is a sort of incidental correlation that arises from

1173
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:46.359
the way that uh that uh human variation was

1174
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:51.220
set up in the last 50,000, 60,000, 100,000 years

1175
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.080
and, and latitude so that you end up with

1176
01:14:55.089 --> 01:15:00.089
a correlation, a correlation is highly diminished when you

1177
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.529
control for the fact that human groups are related

1178
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:07.790
to one another. Now, there's also the, there are

1179
01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:12.620
also some issues of um how differences in nutrition

1180
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:17.540
and differences in uh consumption of different foodstuffs or,

1181
01:15:17.549 --> 01:15:21.560
or whether you tend to face uh uh food

1182
01:15:21.569 --> 01:15:24.180
scarcity at different points in uh in time in

1183
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:28.129
different environments um that affects growth in, in a

1184
01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.890
number of different ways that can affect body form.

1185
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.799
So you see interesting secular changes uh as societies

1186
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:39.470
uh end up with more secure food supplies and,

1187
01:15:39.479 --> 01:15:42.629
and uh different kinds of food often types. So,

1188
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.390
uh stature is a wonderful example of that. Over

1189
01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:49.850
the past 100 years, many, many different societies have

1190
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:55.589
grown uh many centimeters in height as uh as

1191
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.520
diets have changed as you end up with, uh

1192
01:15:59.529 --> 01:16:03.729
you know, uh waterborne diseases are taken out of

1193
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.450
the equation by sewer systems, things like that.

1194
01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:12.299
And actually we saw the opposite when humans adopted

1195
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:17.470
agriculture, right? I mean, our uh the height diminished

1196
01:16:17.479 --> 01:16:21.109
for po I mean, comparing to, for example, Foragers

1197
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.140
center gatherers, the people who lived in societies initially

1198
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:29.770
that were uh based on agriculture looking at their

1199
01:16:29.779 --> 01:16:33.430
skeletons, they, their height was reduced.

1200
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:38.450
Yes. Um THAT uh again, this is sort of

1201
01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:40.310
beyond my expertise and there are a whole batch

1202
01:16:40.319 --> 01:16:43.720
of new papers there that deal with the uh

1203
01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:48.410
stature estimates using genome wide association studies to the

1204
01:16:48.419 --> 01:16:51.049
extent that that will work uh to try to

1205
01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.629
investigate that. Um So I don't know what the

1206
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:57.370
the going opinion on that is, but, you know,

1207
01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:59.649
certainly that's, that's the type of thing that is

1208
01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.490
entirely plausible that you could end up with uh

1209
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.060
in that. Um, YOU know, if you are a

1210
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:11.399
sedentary agriculturist who, agriculturist who lives in one area

1211
01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:13.830
for a long time and you're surrounded by quite

1212
01:17:13.839 --> 01:17:16.430
a few animals and quite a few other humans.

1213
01:17:16.859 --> 01:17:21.180
Um Just the, the disease burden uh is going

1214
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:23.279
to be quite a bit higher and for a

1215
01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:26.770
lot of these diseases that we uh think about

1216
01:17:27.089 --> 01:17:29.529
causing problems for Children when they're young.

1217
01:17:30.439 --> 01:17:34.189
Yes. Uh So, uh I would like to ask

1218
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.049
you also before we move on to the last

1219
01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:39.669
topic of our conversation, we've been talking about uh

1220
01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.870
different kinds of mechanisms that operate in the evolution

1221
01:17:44.879 --> 01:17:48.419
of uh trades complex traits and so on. But

1222
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:53.299
what about evil Devo approaches? I mean, what do

1223
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:57.399
we know about the role that developmental processes themselves

1224
01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:01.439
might play in shaping evolution? And by the way,

1225
01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:05.299
if they shape evolution in what ways does that

1226
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.160
happen?

1227
01:18:07.279 --> 01:18:12.200
So, uh the ways in which a developmental processes

1228
01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:16.069
shape evolution has to do with the ways in

1229
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.479
which they um the ways in which they allow

1230
01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:25.490
variation to be presented in a population. So, if

1231
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.229
you think about long bones, um the bones of

1232
01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.979
your arms and legs and uh that sort of

1233
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:34.839
thing where that grow in length because we have

1234
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:38.560
growth plates and we know how growth plates work

1235
01:18:38.569 --> 01:18:43.140
through uh through developmental biology and a number of

1236
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:47.689
other disciplines. And there are only so many ways

1237
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.319
you can get a growth plate to speed up

1238
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:54.410
its growth or slow down its growth. Um Those

1239
01:18:54.419 --> 01:18:58.939
are limited and those tend at least in most

1240
01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:04.580
mammals to say, be uh bilaterally symmetrical to one

1241
01:19:04.589 --> 01:19:06.799
degree or another. And, and that type of thing.

1242
01:19:07.169 --> 01:19:12.740
So if you uh depending on which mutations you

1243
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:16.189
introduce into the population in, in which genes you

1244
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.689
might end up with a situation where uh all

1245
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.049
of your limbs grow more quickly, you end up

1246
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.189
with longer limbs. Um um BUT in one circumstance,

1247
01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.500
you uh are dealing with how quickly cells replicate

1248
01:19:31.509 --> 01:19:34.000
in the growth plate as opposed to how big

1249
01:19:34.009 --> 01:19:37.279
they get or how rapidly they become hypertrophy that

1250
01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:39.750
is swell in size, which are two of the

1251
01:19:39.759 --> 01:19:42.799
phases that are involved in growing a growth plate.

1252
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:47.770
All right. So what does this do? Um Well,

1253
01:19:47.779 --> 01:19:50.290
if, if things grow together, they can end up

1254
01:19:50.299 --> 01:19:54.069
being correlated with one another and correlated genetically like

1255
01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.069
we were talking about earlier. So development can structure

1256
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.149
the ways in which organisms are prone to correlated

1257
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:07.109
responses to natural selection. So, um two characteristics might

1258
01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.709
be highly correlated at one age and not so

1259
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.430
correlated at another age. So, depending on where natural

1260
01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:17.259
selection is manifest in the life cycle, you could

1261
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:20.279
end up with very independent evolution of the two

1262
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:24.459
characteristics or a very tightly connected evolution of the

1263
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:29.649
two characteristics. So, um Evo devo is very important

1264
01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.430
for understanding how variation gets produced in a population.

1265
01:20:34.299 --> 01:20:36.740
Now, there's, there's a in addition to sort of

1266
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.939
figuring out why things are correlated, the way they

1267
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:42.720
are and how they'll respond to, uh, random genetic

1268
01:20:42.729 --> 01:20:46.700
drift and natural selection. Um, ONE of the things

1269
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:48.680
to think about is that the, the variation that

1270
01:20:48.689 --> 01:20:53.580
you see in a population today, um, is really

1271
01:20:53.589 --> 01:20:57.330
not the variation that got the population there over

1272
01:20:57.339 --> 01:21:01.029
the long term. All of that's been turned over

1273
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.129
by mutation and drift and selection and so on

1274
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.479
and so forth. Maybe there's been some gene flow

1275
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:09.000
or hybridization that sprinkles a little bit in there.

1276
01:21:09.279 --> 01:21:13.290
It turns over and over and over again. And

1277
01:21:13.299 --> 01:21:18.220
um even though that happens pretty regularly, you end

1278
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:20.189
up with a, you know, pretty much the same

1279
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.950
critter through time. And so what that means is

1280
01:21:24.959 --> 01:21:30.359
that the uh um there, there's something robust about

1281
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:33.759
development in the evolutionary context that needs to be

1282
01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:38.660
explained. Um And there, there is a, there are

1283
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:42.399
a couple of uh uh there are a couple

1284
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:46.609
of interesting biases because we typically only see organisms

1285
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.930
by the time that uh we know, say a

1286
01:21:49.939 --> 01:21:51.899
mammal is pregnant or an egg has been laid

1287
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:53.830
or so on and so forth. And there's a

1288
01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:57.370
lot of mortality that happens before that. So, um

1289
01:21:57.379 --> 01:22:00.810
lots and lots of conceptions conceptus is uh in

1290
01:22:00.819 --> 01:22:02.970
humans, just don't make it to the point where

1291
01:22:02.979 --> 01:22:06.850
anyone knows someone that's pregnant. So, uh there's quite

1292
01:22:06.859 --> 01:22:08.520
a lot of bias in terms of that. But

1293
01:22:08.529 --> 01:22:11.160
still, even if you take that into consideration where

1294
01:22:11.169 --> 01:22:14.359
we're not seeing all the really horrible mistakes that

1295
01:22:14.509 --> 01:22:18.689
the development makes. Um THERE is something robust about

1296
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:22.279
it and it's robust to not just environmental differences,

1297
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:25.740
it's also robust to genetic differences in some ways.

1298
01:22:26.379 --> 01:22:30.180
And so the ways in which variation can be

1299
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:35.100
manifest is very important for understanding how longer term

1300
01:22:35.109 --> 01:22:38.899
evolution is going to take place. So if you

1301
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:41.490
at what kind of variation do you need to

1302
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.060
get from point A to point B in a

1303
01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.060
space of possible morphology.

1304
01:22:47.569 --> 01:22:50.830
So getting then into the last topic of our

1305
01:22:50.839 --> 01:22:54.100
conversation today, I would like to ask you about

1306
01:22:54.109 --> 01:22:58.649
a very interesting scientific American article from last year

1307
01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.310
that you wrote with Kara Obbo, who by the

1308
01:23:01.319 --> 01:23:04.120
way, I'm going to interview later this year as

1309
01:23:04.129 --> 01:23:08.049
well. So, and the title is to Understand Sex.

1310
01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.419
We need to ask the right questions and I

1311
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:15.120
know that this article actually on social media and

1312
01:23:15.129 --> 01:23:18.859
elsewhere generated a lot of controversy. But before we

1313
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:23.100
get into that, what was the main argument you

1314
01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:25.779
were making there? Because I get, I guess that

1315
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:29.819
to avoid misconceptions here that probably lots of people

1316
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:33.200
laugh about it. What in your own words, what

1317
01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:34.859
was the argument here?

1318
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:40.339
So um uh to make sure that biology is

1319
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:43.600
more than stamp collecting, you know, just a recitation

1320
01:23:43.609 --> 01:23:46.529
of facts, we have to think about how we

1321
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.069
relate different things in the world, together, world, together

1322
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.609
with theory. And this involves structuring questions and in

1323
01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.569
general, that's kind of how II, I go at

1324
01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.970
things. I, I like to assume that. Um, WELL,

1325
01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:03.640
I don't know what this is. I'm going to

1326
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:06.140
research it. If I knew what it was, I

1327
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:08.899
wouldn't be doing research, I'd just be, you know,

1328
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.810
showing off how, how much I know. Um, AND

1329
01:24:11.819 --> 01:24:13.589
that's not, that's not my job, that's not my

1330
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.270
point. My point is to figure interesting things out

1331
01:24:16.279 --> 01:24:19.089
and that includes questioning things that people kind of

1332
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.950
take for granted. And so a lot of the

1333
01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:28.720
discussions around sex seem to be blending together a

1334
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:31.330
whole bunch of different questions, a whole bunch of

1335
01:24:31.339 --> 01:24:34.450
different goals, a whole bunch of different types of

1336
01:24:34.459 --> 01:24:38.700
things that people want to explain. So the way

1337
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:41.330
that, you know, I look at sex as someone

1338
01:24:41.339 --> 01:24:45.299
who studies genetics of complex traits is uh in,

1339
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:48.839
in, in, in mammals, um in terms of the,

1340
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.259
say the number of sexes. Well, the question I'm

1341
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:56.839
asking is, uh how do these mice reproduce? How,

1342
01:24:56.930 --> 01:25:00.290
how does recombination work? It's very important when we're

1343
01:25:00.299 --> 01:25:04.549
dealing with the genetics of complex traits. Um HOW

1344
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.120
uh you know, and, and a number of very,

1345
01:25:07.129 --> 01:25:11.870
very basic things. So for me, in that context,

1346
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:16.149
two sexes, male and female probably work pretty well.

1347
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:20.970
And that's sort of where my expertise ends. I'm

1348
01:25:20.979 --> 01:25:24.560
not much of a behavioral biologist. I don't do

1349
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:27.529
anything in the way of reproductive ecology and so

1350
01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.330
on and so forth. Now there might be other

1351
01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:32.830
questions for which you might want to divide up

1352
01:25:32.839 --> 01:25:35.279
sex in a couple of different ways, you may

1353
01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:38.680
not want to divide up sex at all. Now,

1354
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:42.209
that's beyond my expertise as, as a scientist. OK.

1355
01:25:42.549 --> 01:25:45.720
So for me, two is fine and for my

1356
01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:50.830
purposes of my question, no problem. Um So one

1357
01:25:50.839 --> 01:25:53.270
of the uh so when one of the funny

1358
01:25:53.279 --> 01:25:56.419
things is about the response was that people thought

1359
01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:59.120
I was, I was trashing the, the, the sex

1360
01:25:59.129 --> 01:26:01.819
binary. That's completely not the point that I was

1361
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.600
making. In fact, I, I rely on it to

1362
01:26:03.609 --> 01:26:09.000
make a living. Um But in that context and

1363
01:26:09.009 --> 01:26:12.169
this uh the article sprung out of a bunch

1364
01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.959
of discussions that um Doctor Keach and I had

1365
01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:20.359
about um uh about how people are talking about

1366
01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:24.589
the spectrum, the spectrum of, of sex or many,

1367
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:30.370
many, many different categories. And the problem with looking

1368
01:26:30.379 --> 01:26:34.779
at it in those ways is that say if

1369
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:38.000
you have a spectrum um and it's along one

1370
01:26:38.009 --> 01:26:41.040
dimension, you still kind of have a binary, it's

1371
01:26:41.049 --> 01:26:46.819
polar, right? And is that doing what these people

1372
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:50.040
wanted to do in, in the end? So the

1373
01:26:50.049 --> 01:26:52.490
people who argue for that and then if you

1374
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.089
have a bunch of different categories, no, you don't

1375
01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:01.120
really have a spectrum. Mm So, um ultimately, when

1376
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:04.509
it comes down to it, whether I think it's

1377
01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.270
a, a binary, so I really don't have to

1378
01:27:07.279 --> 01:27:09.720
worry about the mice that, that don't breed or

1379
01:27:09.729 --> 01:27:12.529
don't make it or, you know, mom gets hungry

1380
01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.229
after giving birth and eats one of them that

1381
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.209
happens. Um, AND, uh, I don't need to concern

1382
01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.479
myself with that in my research. Uh, BUT, uh,

1383
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:27.930
other people may have to and there is, there

1384
01:27:27.939 --> 01:27:29.660
are quite a few different questions out there. There

1385
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:31.709
are quite a few different ways of going at

1386
01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:36.750
it. And, um, I'm inclined to see what happens

1387
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.080
but I would like to see questions be uh

1388
01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:43.759
at, at the front and center and whether a

1389
01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:48.359
binary works in a given situation really depends on

1390
01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.470
what kinds of questions you're asking. No. So you

1391
01:27:51.479 --> 01:27:55.250
might say, well, OK, there's spectrum, there's a spectrum,

1392
01:27:55.319 --> 01:27:58.220
you're, you're really talking about gender when you should

1393
01:27:58.229 --> 01:28:02.390
be talking about sex. OK. That I don't know,

1394
01:28:02.399 --> 01:28:07.069
that's, that's beyond my expertise as a scientist, uh

1395
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.810
any number of other applications like that. And I

1396
01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:15.100
think that there's a temptation the for scientists to

1397
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:20.259
say that the science is established and therefore social

1398
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:24.709
policy ought to be a certain thing. And I

1399
01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.649
don't think that that's what science is for. And

1400
01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:30.910
this is the second argument in the, in the

1401
01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:36.129
article um as a citizen of a country. Um

1402
01:28:36.919 --> 01:28:39.939
I'd, I have a, you know, I ought to

1403
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:43.250
have a voice uh in, in political decision making

1404
01:28:43.259 --> 01:28:46.060
making. I, I certainly in favor of democracy and

1405
01:28:46.069 --> 01:28:49.299
I think everybody should have that have that opportunity.

1406
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.910
Um But there's a difference between my opinion as

1407
01:28:51.919 --> 01:28:56.839
a citizen and my expertise, as a scientist and

1408
01:28:56.850 --> 01:28:59.560
um a lot of these decisions strike me as

1409
01:28:59.569 --> 01:29:02.270
not being all that scientific. A lot of them

1410
01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:05.549
have to do with the politics and the ethics

1411
01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.270
and the morality of the situation, which is well

1412
01:29:09.279 --> 01:29:13.390
beyond the purview of science, you know, if we're

1413
01:29:13.399 --> 01:29:17.439
talking about competition in sports, well, I mean, why

1414
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:19.430
do we structure the competition in the way that

1415
01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:23.359
we do in the first place? Right. You know,

1416
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:27.250
we think about fair competition um uh in the,

1417
01:29:27.399 --> 01:29:30.810
where do our notions of fairness come from? Why?

1418
01:29:30.819 --> 01:29:32.740
Why are we, you know, you know, is there

1419
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:34.629
something some other way that we might be able

1420
01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.580
to do this that allows us to uh allows

1421
01:29:38.589 --> 01:29:42.009
us to have fun in certain ways or you

1422
01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:44.939
get the competitive bug out or, or, or whatever

1423
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:48.560
we might do um that, that, that are rather

1424
01:29:48.569 --> 01:29:50.930
different, given the diversity of games that are out

1425
01:29:50.939 --> 01:29:53.060
there and the way that they are played, it

1426
01:29:53.069 --> 01:29:56.669
seems like there are um there are quite a

1427
01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:01.399
few options. So um I think that the uh

1428
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:06.140
without the questions uh on one hand and without

1429
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:10.319
a little bit of scientific humility and a recognition

1430
01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:13.189
that there's a larger political process that needs to

1431
01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:18.490
be respected and it's important. Um Then the, it,

1432
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.000
it's very easy to get lost in a hashtag

1433
01:30:22.009 --> 01:30:24.490
war and, and pick sites.

1434
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.549
So uh about all of you, all of what

1435
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.259
you said there, I have three or four questions

1436
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:33.089
that I want to ask you before we go.

1437
01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:38.189
So, first of all, um, are there questions that

1438
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.870
would be left unanswered if we did not consider

1439
01:30:42.879 --> 01:30:47.009
how sex might vary across species? I mean, that

1440
01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.709
is, if we might not consider that perhaps I,

1441
01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:54.930
in certain species or in certain contexts, it would

1442
01:30:54.939 --> 01:30:58.419
be better for us to consider more than two

1443
01:30:58.430 --> 01:31:03.160
sexes, less than two sexes or any other variation

1444
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:05.620
of them. Yeah. Well,

1445
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:13.359
uh, there are, yeah, if you're just interested in

1446
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:14.930
who has a big gamete and who has a

1447
01:31:14.939 --> 01:31:17.220
small gamete, you know, eggs and sperm or, or

1448
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:21.970
whatnot. Um, YOU are missing out on just about

1449
01:31:21.979 --> 01:31:27.919
the entire reproductive system. Uh, AND you will, the

1450
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:31.509
degree to which you can predict everything else about

1451
01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.879
the organism based on the gametes, uh, including how

1452
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:43.040
sex determination works. Um, IS, uh, is, is kind

1453
01:31:43.049 --> 01:31:46.549
of limited in many ways and on top of

1454
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.910
that, there are many organisms where there are, uh,

1455
01:31:50.919 --> 01:31:57.500
individuals who don't necessarily reproduce. Um, SO halo deployed,

1456
01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.779
uh, insects and that sort of thing. Typically you

1457
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:03.000
talk about the males and then queens and then,

1458
01:32:03.009 --> 01:32:05.870
and then workers or something like that. And they're

1459
01:32:05.879 --> 01:32:08.620
usually described as sisters of, of the queen or

1460
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:11.709
something like that. But they're really haploid or, uh,

1461
01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.910
you know, you end up with a situation where,

1462
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:17.870
uh, no matter what you do, you have to

1463
01:32:17.879 --> 01:32:20.350
do a lot of explaining to explain the particulars

1464
01:32:20.359 --> 01:32:23.870
of the situation. And we can expect that in

1465
01:32:23.879 --> 01:32:27.549
biology, uh what it comes down to when it,

1466
01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:32.149
when it comes to sex, uh it really matters.

1467
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.979
Uh YOU know, kind of which questions we're asking.

1468
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:39.930
So, uh you know, our naked mole rats who,

1469
01:32:39.939 --> 01:32:43.069
who help out their, their, their mother, the queen

1470
01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.069
of the, of the uh the colony who um

1471
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.810
suppresses the reproduction of all the other females and

1472
01:32:49.819 --> 01:32:52.569
so on and so forth. Uh, YOU know, how

1473
01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.669
does, how do we want to talk about sex

1474
01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.500
in that situation? Um I can see that there

1475
01:32:58.509 --> 01:32:59.729
being, I can see there being a lot of

1476
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.399
complications and a lot of interesting things to talk

1477
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.910
about. But I'd like to see it linked to

1478
01:33:05.919 --> 01:33:08.700
a theory linked to a question as opposed to

1479
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:12.209
people just saying these are the facts because, you

1480
01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:16.000
know, if science has a, has a rough reputation

1481
01:33:16.009 --> 01:33:18.029
with facts, they tend to turn on science pretty

1482
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.520
quickly. So,

1483
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:23.279
yeah, and I was actually going to ask you

1484
01:33:23.919 --> 01:33:27.970
to, to what extent does the question, how many

1485
01:33:27.979 --> 01:33:32.250
sexes are there matter? Because I, I'm asking you

1486
01:33:32.259 --> 01:33:35.439
that because many times we hear and of course,

1487
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:39.439
this is mostly politically motivated people that, but we

1488
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:45.229
hear that if there isn't a set number of

1489
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.339
sexes, usually they are referring to two sexes, then

1490
01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:55.160
it, it's basically anarchy, scientifically and so on. But

1491
01:33:55.169 --> 01:33:57.839
I, I mean, to, to what extent does answering

1492
01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:03.259
that question really matter or having a definite answer

1493
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.080
to that question.

1494
01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:12.049
Um, WELL, I'm not sure. Um, IT mattered what

1495
01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.279
context I guess is what I'd ask in the,

1496
01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:17.120
in the sort of narrow explaining the world science

1497
01:34:17.129 --> 01:34:18.229
type of thing or.

1498
01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.410
Yes. Yes. In that, in that sense. Yeah.

1499
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:27.220
Well, um, the, so if you're a, say, a

1500
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:31.819
demographer or if you're breeding animals in a, in

1501
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:36.180
a, uh, um, in an experimental context or something

1502
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:40.589
like that, maybe uh it doesn't matter all that

1503
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.759
much and two will do. OK, let's say that

1504
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:48.379
you're a, you just are kind of interesting, interested

1505
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:51.120
in how many individuals there are to reproduce and

1506
01:34:51.129 --> 01:34:53.609
that sort of thing. And the uh all you

1507
01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.819
need to know are sort of uh basic properties

1508
01:34:56.830 --> 01:35:00.759
of fertility and, and mortality in a population to

1509
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.490
extrapolate what's gonna happen over the next couple of

1510
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.859
generations. So, uh that's great. That doesn't really deal

1511
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:12.250
with properties of individual organisms all that much if

1512
01:35:12.259 --> 01:35:16.419
you're interested in individual organisms and you're interested in

1513
01:35:16.959 --> 01:35:23.720
uh sexuality, the expression of sex. Um Then maybe

1514
01:35:23.729 --> 01:35:26.229
you don't want to tether it to gametes per

1515
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.819
se. Uh And we can certainly see this uh

1516
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:35.500
taking place in a number of different ways across

1517
01:35:35.509 --> 01:35:38.500
the animal world. Uh But I would say that

1518
01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.580
that uh whether clownfish change sex or whether there

1519
01:35:42.589 --> 01:35:46.220
are different male morphs that are either defend a

1520
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:49.109
territory or sneak in on territory or mimic a

1521
01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.069
female or something like that. Um, THAT matters very,

1522
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.729
very little for how we structure our society as

1523
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:59.060
humans. Uh, I really don't think that we ought

1524
01:35:59.069 --> 01:36:03.029
to be looking to, uh, evolution and nature and

1525
01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.020
all that sort of thing for, for moral guidance,

1526
01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:09.120
we have to look, look to each other, uh,

1527
01:36:09.129 --> 01:36:13.589
in terms of scientific anarchy. Um, YEAH, that's a,

1528
01:36:13.819 --> 01:36:18.470
that's a bit of an overstatement. Um, uh, IN

1529
01:36:18.479 --> 01:36:21.839
the sense that science is science is ideally a

1530
01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:25.759
little bit anarchic. Um, IN that, you know, if

1531
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:30.439
you're supposed to be able to ask questions, answer

1532
01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:32.939
them to the best of your ability and uh

1533
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:38.060
change your mind if things don't look, if your

1534
01:36:38.069 --> 01:36:40.819
explanation doesn't look like it's working out terribly well.

1535
01:36:41.279 --> 01:36:45.140
And ideally that shouldn't be driven by appeals to

1536
01:36:45.149 --> 01:36:48.089
authority or appeals to tradition and that sort of

1537
01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.060
thing, of course they are. But, you know, um,

1538
01:36:51.069 --> 01:36:53.779
a little bit of, a little bit of free

1539
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:58.660
willing thinking does not hurt science and it's certainly

1540
01:36:58.669 --> 01:37:03.919
not pseudoscience. So long as you're asking questions that

1541
01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:07.540
will allow you to say, well, I was totally

1542
01:37:07.549 --> 01:37:09.839
wrong on me to give up or, well, I

1543
01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:12.359
might be right about this but it's a little

1544
01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:14.640
bit over here doesn't seem to be working terribly

1545
01:37:14.649 --> 01:37:18.279
well and I need to readjust it. So, um,

1546
01:37:19.279 --> 01:37:23.120
that is, uh, that, that's the way that I'd

1547
01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:27.060
put it. And again, um, I'm a, I'm a

1548
01:37:27.069 --> 01:37:29.229
maybe a little bit vague here because this is

1549
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.939
outside of my realm of expertise as a, as

1550
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:35.979
a scientist for me, two is just fine for

1551
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:39.250
most of my work. Um I'm not going to

1552
01:37:39.259 --> 01:37:41.350
dictate to other people what they ought to be

1553
01:37:41.359 --> 01:37:43.819
doing, but I do expect them to come to

1554
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:46.629
me with a theory and uh and questions and

1555
01:37:46.899 --> 01:37:48.859
not just tell me that these are facts and

1556
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:50.100
I need to shut up and go away.

1557
01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.350
And also, uh, I mean, of course, if I'm

1558
01:37:54.359 --> 01:37:58.660
saying something stupid here, please correct me. But also

1559
01:37:58.669 --> 01:38:03.560
when it comes to even definitions themselves, I mean,

1560
01:38:03.569 --> 01:38:06.140
in this case, we're talking about sex and would,

1561
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:09.259
what would sex be or mean? But isn't it

1562
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:13.029
the case that people can still be doing very

1563
01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.950
useful work and advancing science? Even if we, we

1564
01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:22.250
have evolved definitions or sometimes even definitions themselves change

1565
01:38:22.259 --> 01:38:25.899
as we uncover more about how things work. Like

1566
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:30.040
for example, definition of gene, the definition of species.

1567
01:38:30.250 --> 01:38:33.000
And I guess that for sex it would be

1568
01:38:33.009 --> 01:38:36.140
the same. And even, uh, I mean, sometimes, even

1569
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:39.479
without having any concrete definition at all, we can

1570
01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:44.259
still progress science, right? At least that's how I

1571
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:47.140
look at the history of science when it comes

1572
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:50.759
to understanding what the gene is, what the species

1573
01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:54.990
is. And I guess currently what the sex is.

1574
01:38:55.879 --> 01:38:56.060
Yeah,

1575
01:38:56.069 --> 01:38:58.990
the I I think that the definition of gene

1576
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.399
and the definition of species are great examples, you

1577
01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:05.430
know, um, you know, the the definition of gene

1578
01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:07.839
seems to have wrapped back around to its original

1579
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:10.790
definition. Uh, AFTER it went through, you know, it

1580
01:39:10.799 --> 01:39:12.850
used to be this factor on a chromosome and

1581
01:39:12.859 --> 01:39:16.129
then, um, or they didn't really know about chromosomes

1582
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.240
then, or, you know how they were. Well, anyway,

1583
01:39:19.439 --> 01:39:24.859
they, uh, and the, then it sort of became

1584
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.950
narrowly biochemical, then people realized, hm, this is not

1585
01:39:27.959 --> 01:39:30.859
working and then looks like all traits are complex

1586
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.350
and it's kind of back to being a factor

1587
01:39:32.359 --> 01:39:35.020
again, right? So that's a, there's a cycle there

1588
01:39:35.479 --> 01:39:38.180
and species is a really interesting one. And, and

1589
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:40.919
this is the one that, uh, Doctor Oak and

1590
01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:43.339
I did it used in the, in, in the

1591
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:48.589
article, in the sense that um, species concepts are

1592
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:53.189
useful in different situations. There isn't such a thing

1593
01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.569
as a identifiable species. If you want to start

1594
01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:01.029
a big fight amongst biologists, tell them to argue

1595
01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.759
about species concepts. It, it's a disaster. It's just

1596
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:07.669
at each other's throats, you know, it's, it's crazy.

1597
01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:12.080
But if you take the biological species concept and

1598
01:40:12.490 --> 01:40:15.149
the nice thing about that is that, well, it's

1599
01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.750
not applicable to the vast majority of life. It

1600
01:40:18.759 --> 01:40:22.919
does come with a set of questions saying, OK,

1601
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:29.000
um, identifying those individuals with whom you can meet

1602
01:40:29.009 --> 01:40:34.770
and produce a viable offspring or offspring that aren't

1603
01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:39.839
uh pedal by uh hybrid uh inability or, um,

1604
01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.720
and anything like that, um uh, you might need

1605
01:40:44.729 --> 01:40:48.799
to evolve a set of mechanisms that allow you

1606
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:53.430
to discriminate on 11 level or another. And so

1607
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:56.990
that comes packaged with a whole set of ideas,

1608
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.040
a whole set of conceptual tools and theory to

1609
01:41:00.049 --> 01:41:04.020
structure your questions. And it may be that well,

1610
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:07.850
these aren't biological species. Uh They may be two

1611
01:41:07.859 --> 01:41:10.529
species on either side of them or two groups

1612
01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:12.859
of organisms on either side of a mountain range.

1613
01:41:13.319 --> 01:41:16.060
Um Well, they, they breed a breed just fine,

1614
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.770
but they never actually interbreed and they look really

1615
01:41:18.779 --> 01:41:24.870
different and that occasionally happens. And in that case,

1616
01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:28.149
you've answered a set of questions and you've generated

1617
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.180
a number of other questions. Maybe you want to

1618
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:33.430
talk about this in terms species, in terms of

1619
01:41:33.439 --> 01:41:38.669
lineages. Now, how did the actual pattern of mating

1620
01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:41.290
as opposed to the possible pattern of mating take

1621
01:41:41.299 --> 01:41:44.580
place? And then that comes with another set of

1622
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:49.750
questions associated with it. And it's, this is, it's

1623
01:41:49.759 --> 01:41:55.129
important to say that um just to throw up

1624
01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.299
your hands and say that it's all very complex.

1625
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:59.810
There's so much stuff out there. We need to

1626
01:41:59.819 --> 01:42:04.250
celebrate the complexity. OK. That's, but that's an aesthetic

1627
01:42:04.259 --> 01:42:08.390
choice or a rhetorical choice. It's not conducive to

1628
01:42:08.399 --> 01:42:11.109
develop, developing a theory that construct your questions.

1629
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:16.819
Mhm So, uh since you mentioned earlier that uh

1630
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:20.799
in your case, for example, the sex binary tends

1631
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:23.819
to work quite well in the study of the

1632
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:27.600
evolution of complex traits. Let me ask you just

1633
01:42:27.609 --> 01:42:30.609
one question. And I, again, I'm trying to avoid

1634
01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.879
the politics here. I don't want to get into

1635
01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:37.339
that. But many times I hear in on social

1636
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:41.899
media podcasts and elsewhere, people claiming and I'm bringing

1637
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:44.339
this claim to the table because it's a scientific

1638
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:48.459
one that you define the way you define sex

1639
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:52.629
is on the basis of a gamut size. Uh

1640
01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.200
But I mean, it might not be or perhaps

1641
01:42:57.209 --> 01:43:01.279
it's not reducible to just that. Right.

1642
01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.330
Yeah. And uh so again, this kind of gets

1643
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:09.620
to the question of how you relate gamete side

1644
01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:13.160
to size to other things. Yeah. If you're just

1645
01:43:13.169 --> 01:43:17.359
looking at game size and isolation, congratulations. You've noticed

1646
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.609
that one gamete is of a different size than

1647
01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:23.390
another. Yeah. Yeah. This does not make you Einstein.

1648
01:43:24.479 --> 01:43:28.939
Um It, it, what, what matters is the set

1649
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:32.810
of connections you can make to other things out

1650
01:43:32.819 --> 01:43:37.029
there in the world. And a lot of times

1651
01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:41.589
I don't really see that happening uh in a,

1652
01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.990
in a careful way. I think that a lot

1653
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.350
of talk of spectra is not doing the kind

1654
01:43:48.359 --> 01:43:49.950
of work that a lot of people think it

1655
01:43:49.959 --> 01:43:52.709
is on the other side. Certainly not all that

1656
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.709
compatible with categories, many, many different categories of sex.

1657
01:43:58.209 --> 01:44:02.580
Uh It, it, there a lot of questions need

1658
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:05.649
to be clarified and when those questions are clar

1659
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.330
clarified, when you clarify how you're interested in things

1660
01:44:10.339 --> 01:44:14.129
relating to one another, then you can make progress.

1661
01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.020
But if you just, if you're just counting, that's,

1662
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:22.379
that's not a particularly interesting scientific exercise.

1663
01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.339
So let me ask you just one last question

1664
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:29.060
and of course, I've alluded to the fact that

1665
01:44:29.069 --> 01:44:33.220
you got different kinds of reactions to this article

1666
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:37.129
on social media and elsewhere. But I mean, looking

1667
01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:39.740
at some of those reactions, what do you think

1668
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:43.740
are perhaps the things that people got wrong the

1669
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:47.339
most when it comes to interpreting what you were

1670
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:50.259
saying in your article? And what, what are perhaps

1671
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:53.859
some of the most interesting reactions you got to

1672
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:54.100
it?

1673
01:44:55.100 --> 01:45:01.910
Yeah. Um, uh, uh, PILE of hate mail. That

1674
01:45:01.919 --> 01:45:02.939
was for sure.

1675
01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:06.919
I guess we all get a little bit of

1676
01:45:06.930 --> 01:45:07.640
that now. And

1677
01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.390
yeah, it's a really, really thick envelopes that you

1678
01:45:12.399 --> 01:45:20.290
gotta worry about. Um, uh, YEAH, the, um, uh,

1679
01:45:20.299 --> 01:45:25.529
there's a tendency among the, um, people who are

1680
01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.270
in favor of a sex binary and only sex

1681
01:45:28.279 --> 01:45:34.450
binary to claim that any sort of, um, questioning

1682
01:45:34.459 --> 01:45:36.220
of that is a, is a part of a,

1683
01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:41.890
uh, is a part of a elaborate scheme to

1684
01:45:41.899 --> 01:45:45.089
undermine western civilization and, and, you know,

1685
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:49.609
it's, it's the woke mind virus,

1686
01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:53.069
right? The woke mind virus. And what's kind of

1687
01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:57.910
interesting is that, um, you know, uh, and as,

1688
01:45:57.919 --> 01:45:59.870
as you probably can tell, I'm much more sympathetic

1689
01:45:59.879 --> 01:46:02.819
to sex binary in a lot of situations, perhaps

1690
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:05.479
a lot of other people would be. Uh, AND

1691
01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:08.509
that's because I, I use it and I can

1692
01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.740
show you how it works for those questions. Um

1693
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.020
uh I thought that I'd get a little bit

1694
01:46:15.029 --> 01:46:18.049
of pushback for the, the part of the article

1695
01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.020
where I do, you know where? Uh OK. And

1696
01:46:21.029 --> 01:46:24.750
I do that, um I do say that the,

1697
01:46:24.759 --> 01:46:30.490
the, the binary might do in certain situations. Um

1698
01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:35.870
What I thought was interesting was the uh part

1699
01:46:35.879 --> 01:46:40.770
where we talk about how um as scientists, we

1700
01:46:40.779 --> 01:46:44.979
have a role in society. Uh, BUT that's secondary

1701
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:47.569
to our role as citizens and that secondary role,

1702
01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:50.979
uh, uh, is an advisory one. YOU know, I

1703
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:52.819
can have my opinions. I've got lots and lots

1704
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:56.750
and lots of opinions. Uh, THEY, I, you know,

1705
01:46:56.759 --> 01:47:00.720
I don't think that I am expert enough in

1706
01:47:00.729 --> 01:47:02.740
everything in the world that I can offer an

1707
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:05.129
expert opinion about everything and that I need to

1708
01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:10.520
be careful about that. So, uh, didn't really get

1709
01:47:10.529 --> 01:47:15.640
much response to that part of the, uh, the

1710
01:47:15.649 --> 01:47:19.540
article and that silence was kind of interesting saying

1711
01:47:19.549 --> 01:47:23.879
that, you know, uh, the science matters. But, uh,

1712
01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:27.020
it's, it's one of those things where it's a,

1713
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:29.720
in a constant state of negotiation. And as you

1714
01:47:29.729 --> 01:47:32.339
pointed out, we, we seem to make progress even

1715
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:36.939
though we regularly revise the most basic things, uh,

1716
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:40.060
that we, that we, uh, that we think about

1717
01:47:40.069 --> 01:47:42.799
but, or the way we think about very basic

1718
01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:47.410
things and I, I thought that, uh, that would

1719
01:47:47.419 --> 01:47:49.870
get a little bit more attention and it would

1720
01:47:49.879 --> 01:47:55.919
seem to be completely ignored. Um, AND, uh, you

1721
01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:59.410
know, I, I, I'm not precisely sure why, uh

1722
01:47:59.419 --> 01:48:04.459
the, the, the statement about the binary being useful

1723
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:10.259
was completely ignored by every side there. So, um,

1724
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:13.700
but that's social media and, you know, that's, that's

1725
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:18.669
more about uh laying claim to being on a,

1726
01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:21.819
a team. Um, AND, and that sort of thing

1727
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:24.450
as opposed to Twitter is not a very good

1728
01:48:24.459 --> 01:48:29.740
place to, to figure things out in detailed argument.

1729
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:36.850
But yeah, and um, you know, it was, um

1730
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:41.430
it was fun to write and uh Doctor Keach

1731
01:48:41.439 --> 01:48:43.810
and I disagree on a lot of things and

1732
01:48:44.419 --> 01:48:47.819
um we, we, we agree on a number of

1733
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:50.370
things and this was sort of a kind of

1734
01:48:50.379 --> 01:48:53.529
a uh a statement that we thought was, was

1735
01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:56.839
a fair summary of, of both of our opinions

1736
01:48:56.850 --> 01:48:59.339
on the matter and how they overlap and pointed

1737
01:48:59.350 --> 01:49:01.970
to a few places where in which they, uh

1738
01:49:01.979 --> 01:49:06.669
which they diverge. But, um then again, if you're

1739
01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:10.609
inclined to write massive uh physical hate mail and

1740
01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:13.100
send it to me at my work address, you're

1741
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:15.359
probably not doing a whole lot of deep reading

1742
01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:20.129
and contemplation of it. But yeah, that's, it's a

1743
01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:23.529
hazard, you know, that, that I'm aware of. And

1744
01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.700
it's one that I one that I'm willing to

1745
01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:30.700
take. Right. So, uh apart from the article which

1746
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:33.000
I'm, of course, leaving a link to in the

1747
01:49:33.009 --> 01:49:36.290
description of this interview? Where can people find you

1748
01:49:36.299 --> 01:49:38.000
and your work on the internet?

1749
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:42.319
Um, I have a Google scholar profile. Uh I

1750
01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:46.439
have, I don't really have a professional website. Um,

1751
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:50.609
uh, AND uh I do have a Twitter account

1752
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.040
that I'm reasonably active on. Although most of my

1753
01:49:55.049 --> 01:49:58.859
more scientific uh interactions take place on blue sky

1754
01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:00.839
these days, but you can find me in both

1755
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:01.100
of those

1756
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:05.990
places. Ok, great. So I'm leaving it uh that

1757
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.919
all in the description box of the interview and

1758
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:11.709
