00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.789
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.650
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.430
today I'm joined by Doctor Duncan Pritchard. He is

4
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.180
distinguished professor of Philosophy in the Philosophy Department at

5
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.670
the University of California Irvine. And he works mostly

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.329
in epistemology. And today we're going to focus on

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.889
topics like truth, epistemic, relativism, epistemic luck, epistemic, risk,

8
00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:31.549
education, intellectual virtues, intellectual humility, and some other related

9
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.389
topics. So Dr Pritchard, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.750
a big pleasure to everyone.

11
00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:39.400
Uh Thanks Ricardo and thanks very much for inviting

12
00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.639
me. I'm delighted to be on your show.

13
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.759
So I would like to start by asking you

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.419
a little bit about truth here. I guess that

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.259
perhaps this is a bigger question than it would

16
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.189
seem at first sight. But what does truth mean?

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.729
Exactly what is truth, particularly for someone who works

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.020
in epistemology like yourself.

19
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.939
So this, this will probably shock you. It shocks

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.419
students anyway when I tell them this, but I

21
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.000
don't think truth is a difficult warm. I mean,

22
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.269
what's, what's difficult I think from a philosophical point

23
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.680
of view is that access to the truth, the

24
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.769
truth, it seems to me is just whatever's the

25
00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.500
case, right? So I, I think that that simple

26
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.059
conception we have, you know, what does it mean

27
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.970
when we talk about, you know, something you just

28
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.120
think about it, what does it mean? You, you

29
00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.169
assert something's the case? What makes it true? Well,

30
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.519
is it the case or isn't it the case?

31
00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:28.940
So, is, is it like that if it's a

32
00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:30.300
fact about the world, is it like that in

33
00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:32.569
the world or is it not like that? What's

34
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.470
really tricky about truth? I think what makes everything

35
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.449
seem complicated? Is that questions about what truth is,

36
00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.360
which I think is straightforward questions get intermingled with

37
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.239
questions about how we access the truth. How do

38
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.930
we know we've got the truth? But those, those

39
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.379
are epistemic questions and that's what esos deal with,

40
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.300
which is not so much what is truth, but

41
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:51.900
how do you know when you have it? What,

42
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.680
what is it to know the truth to grasp

43
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.349
the truth? Uh What is it to be able

44
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.830
to tell when you've got the truth and so

45
00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.900
on? So I think the the really interesting questions

46
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.099
here are epistemological truth itself, I think is just,

47
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.419
it's just whatever's the case.

48
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.960
OK. But then getting into the complicated question that

49
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.270
you mentioned there, uh how can we be sure

50
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:19.289
that we are able through any method and epistemological

51
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.550
approach to access the truth? And if we get

52
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.509
at the truth, how can we be sure that

53
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.690
we really got at it.

54
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.630
Yeah. Well, this is, this is, of course, the,

55
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.139
the, the skeptical problem, I mean, it goes back

56
00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.520
to antiquity. Right. Right. From the start of people

57
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.710
asking philosophical questions, they've been asking that particular philosophical

58
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.619
question because it's not clear. Right. It's not clear.

59
00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:42.759
I mean, what, what certainly seems to be the

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.289
case is that, um, there's perhaps nothing or certainly

61
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.850
hardly anything about which if you, if you know

62
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.080
it, you can be you, you know, it infallibly,

63
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.029
you know, you know, it's a transparent to you

64
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.279
that, you know, there's always the possibility of error.

65
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.089
So that's just a fact about uh a human

66
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.889
condition as it were. Uh I mean, if, if

67
00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.850
God, if there's a God and God has knowledge,

68
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.300
then presumably, yeah, he can be absolutely certain of

69
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.660
what he knows. But that's not our condition. Our

70
00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.960
condition is one of inherent fallibility of uh, of

71
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.720
the feasibility of the possibility of a uh but

72
00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.389
there's more to skepticism than that because of course,

73
00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.949
the mere possibility of error doesn't mean you are

74
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.119
wrong. And so then you get into further questions,

75
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.119
well, like obviously certain truths are more prone to

76
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.839
error than other kinds and so on. So, you

77
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.320
know, a lot of the history of ideas is

78
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.710
about people discovering there's more error than they thought,

79
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.979
you know, you go back to antiquities, people, they

80
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.960
travel to other, other cultures and they realize people

81
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.639
do things differently and then they wonder, well, why,

82
00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:43.130
why do we think this over here? Right? Are

83
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.500
these uh why, what makes our customs true and

84
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.509
so on? And then, you know, you fast forward

85
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.529
um people discover microscopes and then they realize that,

86
00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.550
you know what looks like solid objects aren't solid

87
00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.070
underneath and so on. They've got lots of things

88
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.289
popping about and so on. So more space than

89
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.809
matter inside solid objects and so on. So people

90
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.889
start to doubt like their, the extent to which

91
00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.470
the senses give us truths about the world and

92
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.460
so on. So these, these are hard questions. Um

93
00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.470
Yeah. And as I say, when one of the

94
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.669
things I talk about, one of the things I'm

95
00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.619
most interested in is, is skepticism, particularly radical skepticism,

96
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.838
you know, are there arguments which show that you

97
00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.618
can't know anything? And in fact, I think there

98
00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.169
are some pretty good arguments actually or on the

99
00:04:24.178 --> 00:04:26.348
face of it, good arguments that show it's actually

100
00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:30.289
impossible to know anything, anything of substance anyway. Um

101
00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.178
So yeah, I mean, I can tell you a

102
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.739
bit about those arguments if you like, but that

103
00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:36.598
that's um yeah, that's that, that as I say,

104
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.128
there's the issue about what the truth is and

105
00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.519
then there's this issue about, about access to it.

106
00:04:39.528 --> 00:04:42.289
And I think skeptical trains of thought, they're really

107
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:44.178
focused on the latter and they, they are interesting

108
00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:45.558
deep philosophical questions.

109
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.529
So tell us a little bit more about radical

110
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.320
skepticism. And perhaps, what do you think is valuable

111
00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:57.429
in that uh sort of approach? I mean, because

112
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.820
of course, people could just uh perhaps say that

113
00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:05.929
it could be easy dismissed because for example, if

114
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.690
a skeptic, a radical skeptic would, would claim something

115
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.959
like, oh, there is no truth out there to

116
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.640
be uh found or something like that. I mean,

117
00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:21.350
since he would be making that a truth claim,

118
00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:25.660
people would just say, oh, you're contradicting yourself because

119
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.459
you say there's no truth to be found. But

120
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.130
then you're making this truth claims. So, uh but

121
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.209
I, I mean, it's more complicated than just, uh

122
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.220
that saying that itself a contradictory, right? I mean,

123
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.709
there's probably more to, with epistemological speaking, uh that

124
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.489
is valuable to consider here, right?

125
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.739
Yeah, I, I it's useful here, I think to,

126
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.070
to compare skepticism as a position versus skepticism as

127
00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:00.470
a paradox. So, so, so in, in, in antiquity,

128
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.410
there's this position called uh Perro Skepticism, the pro

129
00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.160
New Skeptics. This is an ethical position that is

130
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.420
in, in the, in the broad sense of an

131
00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:11.320
ethic like uh uh how, how not not ethics

132
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.899
as we think now is morality, but ethics in

133
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.660
the sense of how I ought want to live.

134
00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:16.920
And the idea is that the good life is

135
00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:19.809
a life of doubt. The thought is that it's

136
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.100
dogmatism, it's conviction that leads to disquietude of mind

137
00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:25.339
and the way you get to the quietude of

138
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.980
mind what they call Atia was through a suspension

139
00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:32.309
of belief. So you should employ these skeptical doubts

140
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.809
and in doing so you can end up with,

141
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.579
uh, a kind of, uh, and you sort of

142
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.899
acquiesce and sort of flow through life without asserting

143
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.000
things and so on. Um, AND it's really interesting

144
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.709
position. In fact, it, it has a lot of

145
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.480
commonalities with the eastern thought, like with the Buddhist

146
00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:49.929
and Proto bds thought, Janis thought. And there's a

147
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.450
reason for that because Poo, he, we know he

148
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:54.890
traveled with um Alexander the great in his campaigns

149
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.019
and he made it across uh to the across

150
00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.019
the indus with Alexander. And he met these Indian

151
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.029
mystics and he, he wasn't really interested in their

152
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.140
mysticism, but he was interested in the kind of

153
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.549
the techniques that they were employing uh uh sort

154
00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.799
of basically techniques of radical doubt. And so he,

155
00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:11.160
he, he brought them back. He, he got rid

156
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.320
of the religious aspect of this and just focused

157
00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:16.239
on those uh those radical doubt things and uh

158
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.809
aspects, these the modes, he called them these skeptical

159
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.329
techniques. And um and so, yeah, he became very

160
00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:24.559
interested in, in how to live a good life

161
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:28.420
uh of quite a sh of mind through avoiding

162
00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:33.070
conviction. Um Now, that's PP is quite interesting because

163
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.570
it's, it's, it's a, it's a lived position and

164
00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:37.899
because it's a lived position, you can't doubt everything

165
00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:39.369
because then you wouldn't be able, you couldn't do

166
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.429
anything, you could doubt it. You know, you have,

167
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.920
you need some beliefs in order to function. And

168
00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:46.450
so one of the big questions of pianism is,

169
00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:48.519
how far can the doubt go before it starts

170
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.929
to undermine itself? Um And that's because it's a

171
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.920
position now. Fast forward to dear dear in the

172
00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:59.109
meditation meditations. He has a more radical form of

173
00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:01.130
doubt. And, but for him, it's not a position,

174
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.070
it's really crucial. It's kind of, it's a methodology.

175
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:07.440
He's not saying, you know, I am literally gonna

176
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.869
doubt everything. Uh WHAT he's saying is like one,

177
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.540
we can sort of do the intellectual exercise as

178
00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:14.609
it were, you know, what would it mean to

179
00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.910
doubt everything? So not that we live the doubt,

180
00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:19.170
not that we try and go outside afterwards after

181
00:08:19.179 --> 00:08:21.260
we've done this doubt, but that we just, we

182
00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:23.029
think of it just methodologically speaking, what would it

183
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.619
be to doubt everything? And we try to think

184
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.940
of an epistemology that would survive this, this methodology

185
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.859
of radical doubt. And of course, he's not a

186
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:34.489
skeptic. Uh HE'S an anti skeptic, but his methodology

187
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.780
as it were lives on and his, his anti

188
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.169
skepticism doesn't. So people got very interested in this

189
00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.280
methodology. And I think it's the methodology of paradox.

190
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.508
It's like when you start to think deeply about

191
00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:47.968
our epistemic practices, you realize that there are conflicts

192
00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:51.669
there. We have ways of thinking principles in play,

193
00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.499
which if we employed them consistently would entail we

194
00:08:55.508 --> 00:08:57.268
don't know anything and yet we feel like we

195
00:08:57.278 --> 00:08:59.479
do know lots of things. So there's a deep

196
00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:01.148
tension there and that's what a paradox is. You

197
00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:04.008
know, you think of paradox of vagueness, you know,

198
00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:06.289
we, we talk as if there's objects and we

199
00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:07.689
can pick them out. But when we think about

200
00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:09.869
what objects are, they're vague. And so it seems

201
00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.648
how does the two things, two things seem to

202
00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:13.890
be in tension with each other or, or free

203
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.359
will, you know, we have these thoughts about what

204
00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:18.340
agency is, what freedom is. And then we look

205
00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.510
at the world around us, we think how could

206
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.859
such a thing coexist with that? Well, it's like

207
00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.799
that with skepticism, you know, we look at our

208
00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:28.510
ordinary ways of thinking our ordinary epistemic practices and

209
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.150
we think, well, if we follow through these principles,

210
00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:34.559
we have, then uh we would end up with,

211
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.789
we'd end up doubting everything. But we, at the

212
00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:38.260
same time, we feel like we know lots of

213
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.849
things. So there's like a tension there in our

214
00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:43.039
own concept and, and the principles they're appealing to

215
00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:47.049
here, they're, you know, think about radical skeptical hypotheses.

216
00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:51.690
These are scenarios which um everything is as it

217
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.320
seems, everything as it seems in the, in the

218
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.909
normal case, but you're being radically deceived. So, you

219
00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.159
know, think about like the, the famous one is

220
00:10:00.169 --> 00:10:01.690
the brain in a a which is kind of

221
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.900
like an adaption of Jar's um evil demon hypothesis.

222
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:07.880
But you're a brain of a, you know, you're

223
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.950
being fed these experiences through, you know, super supercomputers

224
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.500
are feeding you these experiences to your brain or

225
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.460
whatever. So you feel like you're walking around, I

226
00:10:16.469 --> 00:10:17.989
feel like I'm talking to you. I feel like

227
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.669
I'm sitting in this room as well, but actually

228
00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:21.010
none of it's really happening. I'm just a, a

229
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.619
vat floating around in a vat of nutrients. Uh,

230
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.510
A brain rather folk floating in a vat of

231
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.799
nutrients. And the thought is, well, that's, that's an

232
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.549
error possibility. And normally you have to exclude error

233
00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:35.780
possibilities. You have to know that they're false. Uh,

234
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.159
BUT, but it seems how would, you know that

235
00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:41.830
that possibility is false. That's, that's the difficulty after

236
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.130
all, everything subjectively is exactly the same. You know,

237
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.090
I can't, it's like if you're dreaming, you can't

238
00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:49.150
pinch yourself to wake yourself up because you dream

239
00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:51.549
the pinch. Well, it's like that in the vat,

240
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.729
you know, you, whatever you would do, like, I

241
00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:55.369
suppose you thought I can feel my legs so

242
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.059
I can't be braining a bat. Um, COS brains

243
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.159
and fats don't have legs. But of course, in

244
00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:01.700
the vat, you would have vat legs. You know,

245
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.190
you would feel like you've had legs even though

246
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.469
you don't have legs and so on. So there's

247
00:11:05.479 --> 00:11:09.309
a real issue here seems possibilities should be excluded,

248
00:11:09.989 --> 00:11:12.299
but there are certain kinds of possibilities we can't

249
00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:14.789
exclude. So how is it then that I know

250
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.020
for example, that I've got hands cos obviously the

251
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.210
brain of that doesn't have hands. I feel like

252
00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:21.789
I know I've got hands but everything I appeal

253
00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:23.559
to when I say, I know I've got hands.

254
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.929
Yeah, I can feel them, I can see them.

255
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.419
And so well, the brain of that can feel

256
00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:28.619
them, the brain of that can see them. So

257
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.489
how do you know you've got hands now, how,

258
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.090
how, what, what grounds you come to your contact

259
00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:35.659
with the world doesn't seem to be your senses,

260
00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:37.590
you know, and so on. So there these are

261
00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:39.869
the kind of arguments that make people wonder about

262
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.979
whether it's possible to have knowledge and, and the

263
00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:44.950
worry you had about skepticism being self defeating doesn't

264
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.940
really affect that because it's not, the idea is

265
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.700
not that you're, it's meant the idea is not

266
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.429
that it's coherent to be a radical skeptic. The

267
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.909
idea is more that radical skepticism is a puzzle

268
00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:58.010
that we all face when we start to think

269
00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:01.099
in a thoroughgoing way about our epistemic concept is

270
00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:02.440
paradoxical. That's the thought.

271
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.869
Very interesting. And so it's one thing to ask

272
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.190
what is truth and how we can really uncover

273
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.590
truth if that's even possible to begin with. But

274
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.909
another kind of question is what is valuing truth

275
00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:23.419
because of course, we hear all the time people

276
00:12:23.429 --> 00:12:27.030
saying that they value truth, but what do they

277
00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:29.190
mean by that? Exactly.

278
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.640
So, iii, a lot of philosophers will say that

279
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.630
to value truth means to sort of maximize true

280
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.659
beliefs or something like that. So, you know, you

281
00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:41.200
should, like, try and have as many true beliefs

282
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.520
as you can and try and have as few

283
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.539
false beliefs. I, I think that's completely wrong. It's,

284
00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:48.039
that's a big mistake. Um Because if you think

285
00:12:48.049 --> 00:12:49.880
about it, if that's what value and truth is,

286
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.909
then, uh, it would trip, the value trip would

287
00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:55.450
be easy. You know, don't go outside, just get

288
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.770
a, sit on the internet and find as many

289
00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.679
simple things as you can and memorize them or

290
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.500
something like that. You know, that, that would be

291
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.440
easy, you know. Um, uh, THE old, the old

292
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.380
example used to be, uh, get it. We don't

293
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.119
have phone books anymore, but maybe you're old enough

294
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.650
to re, I'm old enough to remember phone books,

295
00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:10.929
you know?

296
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.059
Yes, I remember that.

297
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.169
Yeah. But they, so, you know, you tell this

298
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.340
to the, my students, they look at what phone

299
00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:18.440
books. But, uh, you know, the, the old thing

300
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.219
used to be, well, you can memorize phone numbers.

301
00:13:20.229 --> 00:13:22.179
There you go. And each one's a truth, you

302
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.510
know, and a piece of cake, you know, you

303
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.080
can have lots of true, many true beliefs as

304
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.799
you want with the phone book. But what's interesting

305
00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:30.359
about that is that doesn't feel like it's valuing

306
00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:31.799
truth at all. And I don't think it is

307
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:35.770
to value truth is to care about, uh is

308
00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.929
to care about the, the world around you, to

309
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.469
want to have uh a way of understanding the

310
00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:41.590
world around and by the world around you, I

311
00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:43.130
don't just mean the physical world. I mean, like,

312
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.130
you know, the social world, it could be like

313
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.960
it could be your inner world as well. I

314
00:13:47.969 --> 00:13:51.070
think, you know, it's a, any domain of substance,

315
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.570
you know, like, you know, you uh uh trying

316
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.890
to understand, I think, you know, w to care,

317
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.770
care about the truth, might mean you read novels

318
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.679
because you want to understand the human condition or

319
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.530
something like that. Like mind me, you go to

320
00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:04.599
the art gallery because you want to understand what

321
00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:05.969
the art is trying to tell you and so

322
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.780
on. So it's not just physical facts, but it's

323
00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:10.500
to care about. Uh IT'S to care about the

324
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.099
way things are. And I think what we're, what

325
00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:15.770
we're interested in is um I like to think

326
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.820
in terms of a map. So, you know, if,

327
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.969
if someone asks you to, you know, to, to,

328
00:14:21.979 --> 00:14:24.140
to, to draw a map of a region and

329
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.010
you went away and you mapped and find like

330
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.349
incredible detail, one tiny corner of that region, someone

331
00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:31.929
said to you, you don't understand what a map

332
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.309
is. This is useless, right? Cos it is useless.

333
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.219
You know, to map is to sort of get

334
00:14:36.229 --> 00:14:37.969
the big structure of things and then to start

335
00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:40.210
to, to fill in the detail from that structure.

336
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.409
And I think that's what someone who cares about

337
00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:44.780
the truth does, right? They, it's not like they

338
00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:46.809
don't just want to maximize true beliefs. They wanna,

339
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.659
they wanna understand how it all fits together. They

340
00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:51.119
wanna get the, they, they wanna get to the

341
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.020
heart of things. They wanna see how the this

342
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.599
over here connects to this over here and so

343
00:14:54.609 --> 00:14:56.700
on. And I think this is where the intellectual

344
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:01.070
virtues are very important. So uh going back to

345
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.630
Aristotle, we have this in fact. But all intellectual

346
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.039
traditions have some similar idea. You have similar ideas

347
00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:08.789
of Confucius, for example, in classical Indian philosophy. But,

348
00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:12.090
but for us, it's Aristotle, it's this thought that,

349
00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:14.630
that, you know, it, that we can think of

350
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.510
good intellectual character. People have good habits of mind

351
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.210
and, and one of the distinctive features of, of

352
00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:22.570
good intellectual characters, people care about the truth. They

353
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.669
care about accuracy, they care about getting things right.

354
00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:26.789
They care about understanding the world around us rather

355
00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:29.020
than they're curious. They wanna see how things fit

356
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.270
together. They wanna, they wanna get to the bottom

357
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.309
of things and it drives their inquiry. And I

358
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.190
think it's that kind of virtuous desire for the

359
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.770
truth is what we're in when we talk about

360
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.520
the value of the truth. That's what we're interested

361
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.650
in. Uh IF what we try to instill in

362
00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:44.780
our students, for example, we don't want our students

363
00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:47.130
to know lots of facts. We want them to

364
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.150
have a drive within themselves, a curiosity to see

365
00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.640
how things fit together and to be and have

366
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.030
the, the, the, the rigor of mind to be

367
00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:56.780
able to do it for themselves to, to work

368
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.950
out how things fit together and to, you know,

369
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.820
be satis dissatisfied with certain answers and to keep

370
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.669
inquiring to all their finances that are good enough.

371
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.099
Uh uh So since you've already mentioned, uh the

372
00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:13.119
intellectual virtues there, let me take this opportunity and

373
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.969
ask you already a little bit more about that.

374
00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:21.729
So, um what uh are intellectual virtues exactly? I

375
00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:25.059
mean, you mentioned Aristotle there and I guess that

376
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.619
it's safe to say that at least in the

377
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:35.229
western tradition, Aristotle must be the biggest virtue, ethicist

378
00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:39.830
out there. So, uh what uh are intellectual virtues

379
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.210
the same as moral virtues or are intellectual virtues

380
00:16:46.219 --> 00:16:51.539
a different kind of virtue distinct from moral virtues?

381
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.789
So for, for Aristotle, um the, the the virtues

382
00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:01.820
are primarily moral, um I think we can distinguish

383
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.140
them. I mean, certainly some of the traits that

384
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.160
Aristotle was talking about when he talks about the

385
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.650
virtues, he talks about the a good character. So

386
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.449
virtue are a character trait. So they're things that

387
00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:15.989
a traits that when the virtuous traits are admirable

388
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.630
traits of character, these are traits that you've acquired

389
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.189
that you're responsible for not the things that you're

390
00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:22.949
born with, not just your skills or anything. These

391
00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.400
are things that you've acquired over time through your

392
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.550
good character and which we admire people for. Uh,

393
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.430
WHEREAS the vices are the, are the opposite of

394
00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:34.160
that. They're the things, they're the despicable character traits,

395
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.349
the things we blame people for, you know, you

396
00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:38.339
know, so someone's, you know, mean and cruel or

397
00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:40.410
whatever, these are their, their vices and that we

398
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.829
blame them for them. Cos we think that over

399
00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:44.339
time their behavior has led to them to have

400
00:17:44.349 --> 00:17:46.329
these traits. Whereas the, the virtuous people, we think

401
00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.099
that their good behavior over time has led them

402
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:50.410
to have these virtuous traits and some of the

403
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.930
traits, some of them are moral, some of them,

404
00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.939
uh, are intellectual, you know, they're, um, and in

405
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:58.640
fact, in, in many cases, there's, there's, this is

406
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.500
why it gets complicated. There's a kind of moral

407
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.979
and an intellectual side, you know. So the thing

408
00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:04.819
I think about courage, courage seems to be a

409
00:18:04.829 --> 00:18:08.550
virtue, uh, courage can manifest itself, you know, maybe

410
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.939
be moral courage, you know, you, you help people

411
00:18:10.949 --> 00:18:12.709
in need and you take risks to yourself. Well,

412
00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:14.800
but there's also, there's a kind of intellectual courage.

413
00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:16.969
You know, you think that people who are willing

414
00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:19.630
to stick to the truth even when it's unpopular,

415
00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:22.689
uh, people are willing to voice ideas, you know,

416
00:18:22.699 --> 00:18:24.709
because they not because they want to be awkward,

417
00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:26.079
just cos they care about the truth and they

418
00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:27.569
feel people around them aren't doing that, you know,

419
00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:29.680
in every, in any society, there's always some issue

420
00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:32.540
where we depend upon the intellectually virtuous people to

421
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.599
keep us to the straight and narrow as it

422
00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:37.880
were. So, here's a, is a character trait, courage

423
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.750
and it has both a moral and intellectual aspect.

424
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.160
Uh, AND then, you know, some, some virtues like

425
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:48.800
kindness seems specifically moral, some virtues like, um, uh

426
00:18:49.239 --> 00:18:50.969
I'm trying to think of a good example of

427
00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:55.089
this. Um All the ones that spring to mind

428
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.819
out. I, I was gonna say um uh intellectual

429
00:18:57.829 --> 00:19:00.239
humility, but of course, there's humility and there's intellectual

430
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.410
but, but there's a lot of these virtues, we

431
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.010
can think of them as having been specifically intellectual.

432
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.260
So think about intellectual humility, humility in general would

433
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.060
be a kind of um you know, not being

434
00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:14.000
overly proud, not being overly self absorbed and so

435
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.910
on being interested in others and so forth. Intellectual

436
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.739
humility is, is like the intellectual aspect of that.

437
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.530
It's, you know, not um not thinking that my

438
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.619
ideas are better than everyone else that I'm somehow

439
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.979
like, you know, I, I'm, I'm intellectually more important

440
00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:31.280
than everyone else but be interested in what other

441
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.250
people have to say, being open to my possibility,

442
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.489
my fallibility, recognizing it. And so, you know, when

443
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.599
I talk to other people, I'm interested to hear

444
00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:40.089
what they have to say and to think about

445
00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.319
what, how to what extent should I change my

446
00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:44.770
mind and being open minded and so forth? So

447
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.150
we can think of some of these traits has

448
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.939
been specifically intellectual. Um, AND, and what interests me

449
00:19:50.949 --> 00:19:53.530
is that, you know, what, what, what, what as

450
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.170
a person, you know, what, what, how do we,

451
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.839
how do we promote those traits and what do

452
00:19:57.849 --> 00:20:00.400
they involve? And I think that what makes an

453
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.859
intellectual virtue, intellectual virtue in part, at least is

454
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.819
this valuing of the truth, this vetic desire as

455
00:20:06.829 --> 00:20:10.239
I call it, you know, someone can pretend to

456
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.900
be intellectually humble. You know, you think about people

457
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.180
on Twitter, you know, there, there, there's a lot

458
00:20:15.189 --> 00:20:16.839
of, I'm sure we can think of people. They,

459
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.489
they, they're very good at pretending to be intellectually

460
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.410
humble, but what drives them is not the truth,

461
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:26.410
what drives them is uh they want people to

462
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.250
like them or admire them or what have you.

463
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.250
And that's not a virtue for it to be

464
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.780
a virtue. It's gotta be, have the right kind

465
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.489
of motivational state. And in the intellectual case, the

466
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.469
intellectual virtues that it's gotta be rooted in a

467
00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:38.310
motivation, which is a care for the cons for

468
00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:42.050
the truth. So genuinely intellectually humble people, they, they

469
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.020
don't care about the, this, this other stuff. You

470
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.079
know, they don't care about, you know, being admired

471
00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:48.319
or whatever they care about is getting to the

472
00:20:48.329 --> 00:20:50.250
truth. And then of course we do admire them,

473
00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:52.369
but that's not what they're after. What they're after

474
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.050
is the truth. And that grounds their certain kinds

475
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.920
of behaviors, like their intellectual humility, their intellectual tenacity,

476
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.939
their intellectual courage and so on. Uh, YEAH, so

477
00:21:00.949 --> 00:21:03.300
that's the intellectual virtues. I, I think they're really

478
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.780
important traits. Um, AND indeed, I think actually all

479
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.140
of us think that, I mean, you think of

480
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.670
people you admire, uh particularly people you admire from

481
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.630
an intellectual point of view. And I bet you

482
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.060
when you start to describe them, your, your ST

483
00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:19.270
your, your things, the word you'll end up talking

484
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.770
about intellectual virtues. This is the, you know, we,

485
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.910
we recognize that this is a, this is a

486
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.280
good way to be. I mean, Aristotle thought this

487
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.329
is the, it's an epic so that the good

488
00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:32.040
life, the life of flourishing Eudemonia is the virtuous

489
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.949
life. And I think that's right. And so, and

490
00:21:34.959 --> 00:21:36.540
then the thought is one aspect of the good

491
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.819
life is an intellectual aspect. It's uh it's not

492
00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:43.010
just about morality, not just about, there's practical wisdom

493
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.939
as well for, for our soul, but it's also

494
00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:47.349
about having good habits of thought. And if you

495
00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:49.000
think about that, it makes sense. You know, when

496
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.969
we think of imagine someone who is very moralistic,

497
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:55.750
but then they'd lack intellectual virtues. People like that

498
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.599
are usually a disaster. You know, you know, there's

499
00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:00.099
a saying, I don't know if you have this

500
00:22:00.109 --> 00:22:02.250
in Portugal that the, the, the road to hell

501
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.719
is paved with good intentions.

502
00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:08.630
Yes, we have a similar kind of ri, yeah,

503
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.060
I, I'm sure we all think of people. They,

504
00:22:10.069 --> 00:22:12.439
you know, they, they have very earnest morality but

505
00:22:12.449 --> 00:22:14.515
they, because they don't think things through and they

506
00:22:14.525 --> 00:22:17.435
don't really, they're not careful about the, their, their,

507
00:22:17.444 --> 00:22:20.675
it's, it's their moralities, their moral urges are thrown

508
00:22:20.685 --> 00:22:22.244
all the wrong directions, whatever you need to have

509
00:22:22.255 --> 00:22:25.795
good intellectual traits in order to ground your morality,

510
00:22:25.805 --> 00:22:27.635
in order to have it, have it directed in

511
00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:30.250
the right kind of place, you know, like uh

512
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.599
as uh as Aristotle says, you know, like moral

513
00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:34.760
judgment is a kind of judgment and therefore it

514
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.790
requires a kind of knowledge, it requires a skill

515
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.130
to make, you know, gotta be alert to the

516
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.849
relevant factors. And so the intellectual virtues are really

517
00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:45.670
crucial to uh to morality. That's the way in

518
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.250
which they interconnect cos I sort of think they

519
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.550
connect even more closely. But certainly, you know, the,

520
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.579
the good life has this important component uh which

521
00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:54.930
is specifically intellectual.

522
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.089
Mhm. Uh So I would like to get here

523
00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:02.520
a little bit into education because that's also a

524
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.920
topic of your interest. But just before we do

525
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.579
that, there's perhaps a little bit more uh ground

526
00:23:09.589 --> 00:23:12.589
in epistemology that we have to cover here. That

527
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.099
is probably also important to understand how you think

528
00:23:17.109 --> 00:23:22.020
about and approach education. So what role does luck

529
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.359
play in the epistemology?

530
00:23:26.089 --> 00:23:29.699
So luck's really interesting because it seems like, uh,

531
00:23:29.709 --> 00:23:31.910
know, for, for knowledge, there seems to be an

532
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.479
anti luck condition. And what I mean by that

533
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:37.089
is when you know something you can't be, it

534
00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:38.640
can't be that you get to the truth by

535
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.439
luck. Right. We seem to have this strong intuition

536
00:23:41.449 --> 00:23:44.910
about knowledge. So, I mean, obviously the obvious case,

537
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.780
like, guess work, you know, you don't, you get

538
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.060
your lucky guesses aren't knowledge. But the, the more

539
00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:52.260
interesting cases are cases where you form your belief

540
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.439
with good reasons. These are get cases that they're

541
00:23:55.449 --> 00:23:57.079
so called. You, you have good reason to believe

542
00:23:57.089 --> 00:24:00.189
something. But even so what you believe is only

543
00:24:00.199 --> 00:24:01.689
true as a matter of luck. So I, I'll

544
00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:03.349
give you a famous one. This is not Getty,

545
00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:06.430
it's uh Roderick Chisholm's, but you're a farmer, you're

546
00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:08.910
looking in a field and you see what looks

547
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.750
like a sheep. So you quite rightly believe there's

548
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.079
a sheep in the field. Uh, AND there is

549
00:24:14.089 --> 00:24:15.790
a sheep in the field, but what you're looking

550
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.449
at isn't a sheep. What you're looking at is

551
00:24:17.459 --> 00:24:19.849
a big hairy dog. Looks like a sheep which

552
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:22.109
hidden from view behind that is a real sheep.

553
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:24.530
Now, we have a very strong intuition here. You

554
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.319
don't, you don't know the shit there, right? It's

555
00:24:26.329 --> 00:24:28.310
just luck that your belief happens to be true,

556
00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:30.469
even though your belief is true and it's justified.

557
00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:32.589
It's just luck that it's true. So you don't

558
00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:36.170
know it and that suggests that there's knowledge has

559
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.219
this anti luck but you, you, you can't get

560
00:24:39.229 --> 00:24:42.030
to knowledge through luck. So, what we want, uh,

561
00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.619
when we think about what it is to know,

562
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.250
we want to have ways of getting to the

563
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.030
truth, which is sort of luck excluding. And, uh,

564
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.239
one thing I tried to do, uh, in my

565
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.780
work is, um, it, it used to be that

566
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.310
people just took this as um as just a,

567
00:24:57.469 --> 00:25:00.010
an obvious truth and then they move on. But

568
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.530
it seems to me, you know, if we take

569
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.839
it seriously, we should try and unpack it a

570
00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:04.530
little bit and I, we discover when we unpack

571
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.560
it, it gets quite interesting. So first off, if

572
00:25:07.569 --> 00:25:09.079
we unpack it, that means we need a theory

573
00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:10.819
of, we need a theory of what luck is.

574
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.699
And it really odd until a few years ago,

575
00:25:13.709 --> 00:25:16.479
there wasn't a philosophical account of luck. The philosophers

576
00:25:16.489 --> 00:25:17.699
didn't talk about it. They just sort of took

577
00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:19.300
it as we well know what luck, which is

578
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.839
really odd if you think about it, cos philosophers

579
00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:23.969
define everything, even things, arguably they don't need to

580
00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:26.680
be defined. Uh But they didn't bother with that.

581
00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.920
Um So one thing I tried to do was

582
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.180
offer a theory of luck and I have work

583
00:25:30.189 --> 00:25:32.130
called a modal theory. And what that means is

584
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.099
that roughly lucky for, for an event to be

585
00:25:35.109 --> 00:25:38.560
lucky. It's gotta be something that doesn't obtain but

586
00:25:38.569 --> 00:25:41.560
could have easily obtained. So, you know, think about

587
00:25:41.569 --> 00:25:45.390
lottery win, you know. Uh, SORRY. Um, I've got

588
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.609
somewhere but lucky it, it obtained but it could

589
00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:49.550
have easily, not obtained. Whereas the other, so think

590
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.119
about a lottery win, you know, what, what, what

591
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.979
makes it a lucky win? Well, you won the

592
00:25:53.989 --> 00:25:55.479
lottery but you could have easily not won the

593
00:25:55.489 --> 00:25:58.310
lottery. Right. There's, you know, think about flo, talk

594
00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:00.180
about possible worlds to make this vivid. So we're

595
00:26:00.189 --> 00:26:03.079
in the actual world, well, that we can imagine

596
00:26:03.089 --> 00:26:05.239
possible worlds. Worlds are slightly different from the actual

597
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.260
world and the, you know, the more different they

598
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.770
are the further out they are. Well, you win

599
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.089
the lottery but it, there's lots of worlds just

600
00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:15.229
like this world you lost. Right? And that's why

601
00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:17.589
it's lucky that you won the lottery. I conversely,

602
00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:19.609
you know, if you don't win, that's why it's,

603
00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:21.109
you're not winning as a matter of, lot of

604
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:23.130
lot cos you could have easily won. Right. So

605
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.540
it works in both directions. I mean, even though

606
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.859
the probabilities are massively against you, you could easily

607
00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:29.589
win the lottery. Right? But all it matter, all

608
00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:31.140
it needs is a few colored balls forming a

609
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.380
slightly different configuration. And which is why, by the

610
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.949
way, people play lotteries, uh, but they don't make

611
00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:39.099
bets, they would make a bet with those kind

612
00:26:39.109 --> 00:26:41.819
of odds, but they play the lottery. Cos normally

613
00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:43.959
bets with long odds are, are on events that

614
00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:46.229
just, they don't happen in worlds like this world.

615
00:26:46.239 --> 00:26:49.170
You know, um, you know, the odds of that,

616
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.010
I think it's 16 million to one. The British

617
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.800
lottery. So let's say, you know, if you wanted

618
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.819
odds on me winning the Olympic gold at the

619
00:26:55.829 --> 00:26:58.390
next Olympics, that's probably get 16 million to one.

620
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.780
But you'd be crazy to make that bet because

621
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.680
the world in which I win Olympic gold, the

622
00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:05.569
next Olympics is nothing like this world, right? You

623
00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:07.229
know, that's, I'm not, it's not gonna happen. You

624
00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:09.219
know, I need to, I need to be 20

625
00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:11.010
years younger at a different physique and so on.

626
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.400
But it's, you know, different in the case of

627
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.910
the lottery, you know, you, you place a bet

628
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.050
on the lottery by buying a ticket and you

629
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.040
could easily win. Right? I mean, that's, that's why

630
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.510
you do it. Uh, THERE used to be an

631
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.119
advert in, um, in an advertisement in Britain for

632
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.219
the lottery where they used to say that the

633
00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:30.099
slogan was, it could be you. And they had

634
00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:32.719
this sort of finger of God floating, you know,

635
00:27:32.729 --> 00:27:34.400
and people walking along with their tickets and then

636
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.489
they get Zapped. Well, that's, it's not the could,

637
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.069
there is not a problem code, right? Pro It

638
00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.229
couldn't be you, but it's a modal code. What

639
00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:44.560
it's saying is it could easily be, you. Not

640
00:27:44.569 --> 00:27:46.260
much needs to change for you to, if you

641
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.109
have a lottery, not much needs to change because

642
00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:50.060
it'd be a lottery win. So, I think that's

643
00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:53.219
what luck is. Luck is about modal closeness. It's

644
00:27:53.229 --> 00:27:57.040
about, you know, um, you know, like, get it

645
00:27:57.859 --> 00:27:59.560
even if you don't, if you don't win the

646
00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:01.770
lottery. Well, it's still, you know, you could have

647
00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.589
easily won it. Right. So, it's, uh, that's why

648
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:05.319
you're not winning as a matter of luck. But

649
00:28:05.329 --> 00:28:06.880
if you do win the fact that you've won

650
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.890
is a matter of luck. Cos you could have

651
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.800
easily, not won and so forth. Or in the

652
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.829
sheep case, you know, schisms sheep case. It's lucky

653
00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:14.880
that his belief is true because although he's got

654
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.339
a true belief, it could have easily been false.

655
00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:19.609
If that sheep behind the sheep, big hairy dog

656
00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:21.689
had wandered off, then his belief would have been

657
00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:23.959
false. So it's a matter of luck given how

658
00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.280
he formed his belief, he could have easily been

659
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.140
false. So that's what luck is. And then once

660
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.500
we understand what luck is, we can start to

661
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.449
think about how that relates to knowledge and what

662
00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:34.050
it means in effect, I'll, I'll tell you the

663
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.069
details. But if luck is a modal notion, then

664
00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:38.750
it means there needs to be this modal condition

665
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.180
on knowledge. That's what I call a safety condition.

666
00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:43.500
Knowledge has to be safe. Basically, it's not enough

667
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.689
just to get to the truth, but you've got

668
00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:46.630
to get to the truth in a way which

669
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.949
means that you couldn't have easily been wrong. So

670
00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:51.750
that's the anti luck condition. And so we end

671
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.709
up finding out something quite interesting about knowledge about

672
00:28:55.109 --> 00:28:58.160
the conditions that it demands. And here's something else

673
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.540
that is interesting as well that to the results,

674
00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:04.589
you might think that knowledge has like an ability

675
00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:06.510
condition as well. It's like when, you know, you

676
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.800
get the truth through your abilities, you know, you

677
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.089
can't get there, you can't get there through, you

678
00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:13.849
know, your guess, work, for example, you can't get

679
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:16.849
there through. You know, I, I, if, if you

680
00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:19.989
have, um, you know, if, if someone thinks that

681
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.469
they're clairvoyant but they're not and they predict something

682
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.530
and it turns out to be true that they

683
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.000
didn't let him know. Right. Because that's not the,

684
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.800
the, the actual bill is this year. It seems

685
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.369
it's gotta be your ability to get there, these

686
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.550
reliable traits to get to the truth. And you

687
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.849
might think, well, that's getting to the truth through

688
00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:40.739
reliable traits. That's luck excluding. And usually it is,

689
00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:42.910
but it's not always like, excluding, which is kind

690
00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.569
of interesting. I mean, think about the farmer, the

691
00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:47.609
farmer was getting to the truth in a way

692
00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.969
through their abilities. I mean, normally that's a good

693
00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:51.290
way of finding out whether there's a sheep in

694
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.650
the field having a look and if it looks

695
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.719
like a sheep believing it's a sheep, but your,

696
00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:57.339
your abilities can get you to the truth and

697
00:29:57.349 --> 00:29:59.170
yet it could still be the case that your

698
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.209
belief is lucky. So it seems like there's, there,

699
00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:04.869
there are two slightly different conditions on knowledge. One

700
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.459
is about getting there through your abilities. In other

701
00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:08.739
words, be getting there in a way that excludes

702
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.819
luck and they're not quite the same thing. So

703
00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:12.459
I think you find out quite interesting things about

704
00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.839
the structure of knowledge by, by thinking about the

705
00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:15.660
role of locking it.

706
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:21.589
Uh But since getting to through, through your abilities

707
00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:25.010
and excluding luck as much as possible are not

708
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.689
exactly the same thing. I mean, to what extent

709
00:30:29.699 --> 00:30:35.030
can we really be sure about how much epistemological

710
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.040
lucky we are.

711
00:30:38.729 --> 00:30:40.369
Yeah, I mean, that's a good point. So, and

712
00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.069
one of the things about skepticism is the radical

713
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:46.589
skeptic in a way is trying to make it

714
00:30:46.599 --> 00:30:48.420
feel like it's just lucky that we get the

715
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.010
truth, right? So, remember that the radical skeptic, if

716
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.900
they're, if they're clever, they won't say that you

717
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.489
are a brain diverse. They just say, well, you

718
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.469
could be for all, you know, you could be

719
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.430
and of course you can't tell. So it seems

720
00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:02.020
like, well, even if you are not a round

721
00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.699
of that, even if everything is just exactly as

722
00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:05.300
you've seen, it feels like, well, isn't it just

723
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.189
a bit of luck? Do you happen to be

724
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:08.739
in the world like this world rather than in

725
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.069
the world like that one? After all? You can't

726
00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:13.609
tell the difference. Right. Mhm. But that's, that's kind

727
00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:15.739
of interesting. You can re, you can, you can

728
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.859
recast skeptical arguments in terms of this luck intuition.

729
00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:22.949
Um, AND, uh, and I think that behooves us

730
00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:25.089
to come up with answers to these, the skeptical

731
00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:29.069
arguments. Um, YEAH. So, yeah, that, that's true. And

732
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:31.750
so, hence another reason we have to deal with

733
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.369
skepticism.

734
00:31:32.709 --> 00:31:38.500
Mhm. So, another question then is what is epistemic

735
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.380
risk?

736
00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:44.109
So, it, it's really interesting. The, you know, I

737
00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:47.680
started this debate about luck and then I noticed

738
00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:51.699
that luck and risk go very closely together. I

739
00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:54.650
mean, they're not quite the same thing but they're

740
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.209
very close. They're almost like the same thing viewed

741
00:31:58.219 --> 00:32:02.089
from different angles. So, think about, um, uh, I

742
00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:05.209
suppose you survive a plane crash, you might say

743
00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:06.949
I'm lucky to be alive, right? And what you

744
00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:08.489
mean, it seems one way of understanding that is,

745
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.290
well, I could have easily died, right? You know,

746
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.550
like if I'd been at the back of the

747
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.900
plane, I would be dead and I could have

748
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.020
easily at the back of the plane. But I

749
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:15.859
was at the front of the plane, the front

750
00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:18.089
of the plane didn't get crushed in the crash.

751
00:32:18.099 --> 00:32:20.430
You know, so I'm lucky to be alive. And

752
00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:22.640
that's from a sort of backwards perspective. You know,

753
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.959
I survived. I'm looking backwards. I say I'm lucky

754
00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:28.189
you could rewind as it were from the forwards

755
00:32:28.199 --> 00:32:30.719
perspective. You could say the exact same thing and,

756
00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:32.739
and put it in terms of risk, you know,

757
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.839
getting onto that plane, I'm at high risk of

758
00:32:34.849 --> 00:32:37.900
dying, you know. Uh, AND, and, and so what,

759
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.069
what that seems to suggest is that risk is

760
00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:42.459
also a modal notion, you know, what is for

761
00:32:42.469 --> 00:32:44.420
something to be high risk is that it means

762
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.739
it could easily, it's something, it's like a risk

763
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:49.000
event, something you don't want to happen, could easily

764
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.979
happen. So a lot of our assessments of risk,

765
00:32:51.989 --> 00:32:53.579
I think, I like that. You know, like when

766
00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:55.719
I, if I'm wondering to myself, should I get

767
00:32:55.729 --> 00:32:58.199
on that plane? Is it risky? What I'm trying

768
00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:01.069
to think to myself is, is the world the

769
00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.510
possible world in which that plane crashes? Is it

770
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.000
a close world? Is it a world like this

771
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.079
one? You know, is there something about that plane,

772
00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:11.089
you know, are the engines bad? Is the pilot

773
00:33:11.099 --> 00:33:13.079
a bad pilot? You know, are the weather conditions

774
00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:15.199
terrible or whatever? Is there something going on which

775
00:33:15.209 --> 00:33:17.660
would make it such that there are close possible

776
00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.520
worlds where that plane crashes. If it is, then

777
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.939
that's high risk. Whereas if it's not, you know,

778
00:33:22.949 --> 00:33:25.630
if the plane is reliable and the weather conditions

779
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.599
are great and the pilot's conscientious and so on,

780
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.839
well, then there's low risk because the, the risk

781
00:33:30.849 --> 00:33:33.040
event, the vent of it of it crashing is

782
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.550
not close, it's not the kind of thing that

783
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.640
could easily occur So, so that, so if that's

784
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.719
right, then the modal account of luck and the

785
00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:43.530
modal account of risk, they go hand in hand.

786
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.500
I mean, there, there, there are some complications I'll

787
00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.920
spare you. There are some slight differences but roughly,

788
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.979
you know, uh, we, we want to exclude luck.

789
00:33:50.989 --> 00:33:53.640
We want to exclude, uh, from knowledge. We also

790
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.239
want to exclude risk. It's just a question of

791
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.910
perspective. Uh, WHAT the Sorry John.

792
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.239
Yeah. Ok. But, but what if we were talking

793
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:10.850
about epistemology and knowledge, what are we risking exactly?

794
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:14.159
So I take it to the risk event when

795
00:34:14.168 --> 00:34:17.370
it comes to epistemology is, is, is supposed to,

796
00:34:18.168 --> 00:34:19.579
you know, we're trying to get to the truth

797
00:34:20.009 --> 00:34:21.708
and the risk of it is, well, we, we,

798
00:34:21.717 --> 00:34:23.259
we fail, we end up with a, with a

799
00:34:23.268 --> 00:34:26.149
false belief instead. So, you know, we have some

800
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.530
way of forming a belief and then, you know,

801
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.870
that's in the like in get cases and actually

802
00:34:30.879 --> 00:34:33.110
it gets us to the truth, but we think

803
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.458
it's not large cos it could have easily led

804
00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.478
to the false and, and you can run that

805
00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:39.049
whole thing in terms of risk. You know what

806
00:34:39.059 --> 00:34:41.039
you're saying is in these get a cases, you've

807
00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:42.708
got a way of getting to the truth, which

808
00:34:42.717 --> 00:34:44.628
is risky because it could have easily led to

809
00:34:44.638 --> 00:34:47.329
false do so, you know, it gives forwards versus

810
00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:50.349
backwards perspective. Again, you know, the get a case,

811
00:34:50.358 --> 00:34:52.029
the person got to the truth. And we're looking

812
00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:53.868
backwards a bit like surviving the plane crash. Well,

813
00:34:53.878 --> 00:34:54.819
I got to the truth, but I could have

814
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:58.009
easily been wrong. We can rewind looking forwards. You

815
00:34:58.019 --> 00:34:59.928
know, the farmer looks out into the field. Ok.

816
00:34:59.938 --> 00:35:01.509
They have a way of forming a belief that's

817
00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:04.188
generally a good way. But in these cases, it's

818
00:35:04.198 --> 00:35:07.280
risky because it could have easily, it could easily

819
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.429
to a false belief. Right. Because it could easily,

820
00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:12.169
you know, the sheep isn't in, is wanders out

821
00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:13.540
of the field, then it'll end up with a

822
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.320
false belief. So it seems like the drive to,

823
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.570
to get rid of lucky true beliefs and knowledge

824
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.689
also is a drive to get rid of risky

825
00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:25.709
true beliefs, get rid of high levels of academic

826
00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:29.780
risk. The reason why this is interesting though is

827
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.879
that, um, some people question the lucky in tuition,

828
00:35:32.889 --> 00:35:35.179
they say, well, you know, is it so clear

829
00:35:35.189 --> 00:35:38.280
that, um, we want to, you know, why, why

830
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.760
can't there be lucky knowledge? You know, and it's,

831
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.189
it's, it's interesting, you know, philosophers have that intuition

832
00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:47.419
quite strongly. I find, um, even the introductory students

833
00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:50.209
get that intuition very clearly, but there is some

834
00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:53.399
reason to think that the general public aren't so

835
00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:56.189
signed up to that intuition as we are, you

836
00:35:56.199 --> 00:35:57.479
know. So, I mean, even in the case of

837
00:35:57.489 --> 00:35:59.629
a lucky guess, we often attribute not, you know,

838
00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:02.929
the, the, the contestant answers the question, they're obviously

839
00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:05.659
guessing someone in the room says, did he know

840
00:36:05.669 --> 00:36:07.850
the answer? Gets it. Right. Yes. He knew the

841
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.659
answer. You know, it seems that doesn't seem terrible

842
00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.459
thing to say. Right. So, a lot of people

843
00:36:13.469 --> 00:36:15.479
say, well, maybe lucky is ok then, well, uh,

844
00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.699
but then I suppose we've run the same thing

845
00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:19.350
with risk. You know, there does seem a stronger

846
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.969
intuition that getting to their knowledge shouldn't gain to

847
00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:24.810
the knowledge shouldn't be compatible with high levels of

848
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.689
epidemic risk. And, uh, so one thought you can

849
00:36:28.699 --> 00:36:31.169
have here is that risk is where is the

850
00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:33.350
more dominant notion? Like, why do you want to

851
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.520
get rid of luck? It's because you want to

852
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.870
get rid of risk. You know, cos risk is

853
00:36:36.879 --> 00:36:39.439
a thing to be excluded. You know. So the,

854
00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:41.159
the thought is risk is a more primary, even

855
00:36:41.169 --> 00:36:42.629
though they kind of go hand to hand risk

856
00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:45.260
is the more primary notion because we, we care

857
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.959
about getting rid of luck because really what we

858
00:36:46.969 --> 00:36:49.459
wanna do is eliminate, we wanna minimize epidemic risk.

859
00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:51.820
Uh, AND if that's right, that's a way of

860
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.959
grounding that intuition about luck.

861
00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:58.550
Mhm. Yes. And when it comes to those intuitions

862
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.090
that people have, I guess that it's very important

863
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.629
here to keep in mind that. So, for example,

864
00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:11.209
if someone just, uh, luckily guesses the right answer

865
00:37:11.659 --> 00:37:16.949
it, it doesn't ring true that they really knew

866
00:37:17.379 --> 00:37:21.790
what the answer was. Right. I mean, because knowing

867
00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:26.620
the answer is not uh or, or guessing the

868
00:37:26.629 --> 00:37:29.889
correct answer is not the same as knowing it.

869
00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:32.429
I mean, that that's also, I guess at least

870
00:37:32.439 --> 00:37:36.500
if we explain that directly to people, it's, it

871
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.169
also seems intuitive, right? That if someone just guessed

872
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.850
it's not the same as them knowing it.

873
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.189
I mean, this is, I think what I think

874
00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:49.250
you've come across experimental philosophy, but this is one

875
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.399
of the problems experimental philosophers, they, they test, they

876
00:37:52.409 --> 00:37:54.959
test intuitions by going and asking the public questions

877
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.679
and then they get all the data and then

878
00:37:56.689 --> 00:37:57.899
they come back and say, look, this is what

879
00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:01.840
the the public think is intuitive, but the intuitions

880
00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.199
aren't just your first judgment or the first judgment

881
00:38:05.209 --> 00:38:06.570
of the folk as it were. That's not an

882
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.879
intuition. And you, you know that you find this

883
00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:11.909
out very clearly when you start teaching philosophy, your

884
00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:13.860
intuitions that where are your sort of judgments under

885
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.800
reflection? So, you know, when you first start teaching

886
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.340
students and you, you can throw out a bunch

887
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.600
of scenarios and they, their, their thoughts are all

888
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.040
over the place. Um YOU know, is it, this

889
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.610
is it that and then as it were that

890
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.659
over time when they start to think about it,

891
00:38:26.669 --> 00:38:28.500
their thoughts start to stabilize. So in that in

892
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.159
the quiz showcase, they might say it's knowledge immediately.

893
00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:32.790
But then when they start to think about it,

894
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.340
well, it's not really knowledge as a guess, you

895
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.080
know. So as it were that first, that first

896
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.800
judgment isn't stable. And what we're interesting when we

897
00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.300
talk about intuitions is the ST the stable intuitions.

898
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.239
It's not just the first, the first judgment you

899
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.179
come to, it's what, what when you think about

900
00:38:47.189 --> 00:38:48.310
it, you start to put it together and you

901
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.340
start to reason it through. What, what judgment do

902
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.870
you settle on? And I think there, we, there's

903
00:38:52.879 --> 00:38:54.320
a lot of, you know, there's a lot of

904
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.929
convergence and the philosophers, what we're doing when we

905
00:38:56.939 --> 00:39:00.090
do philosophy is we're trying to examine our intuitions

906
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.060
in that sense, we're trying to let them stabilize

907
00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.719
and we're trying to sift them through and see

908
00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:06.489
how they fit together. And it's that considered judgment

909
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.840
is, is the intuition, not the sort of first

910
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:09.350
judgment.

911
00:39:10.699 --> 00:39:14.340
Uh And since we're talking about risk here, what

912
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.760
would an anti risks epistemology be like?

913
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.989
Yeah, so what you want is um whereas before

914
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.600
you'd have an anti luck condition instead you have

915
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.250
an anti risks condition. So you want to have

916
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.590
a way of form it, you'll build into your

917
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.229
theory of knowledge, um some principle to the effect

918
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:36.840
that you're forming your beliefs in ways uh that

919
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.310
it's that, that exclude high levels of risk. I

920
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.780
I high levels of risk that your beliefs are

921
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.949
formed to be false. Um And uh of course,

922
00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:46.649
given what I said earlier, that will be understood

923
00:39:46.659 --> 00:39:49.070
modally. So what it will mean is that given

924
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.100
how your foreign beliefs are not close possible worlds

925
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.820
where the risk of it, of the false belief

926
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.629
occurs. So, you know, like, say practical terms, you

927
00:39:56.639 --> 00:40:00.530
know, um, I mean, this is why g guesswork

928
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.340
is no good because guesswork might get you the

929
00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.110
truth in the actual world. But of course, it

930
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.870
could easily get you to the, it are lots

931
00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:08.300
of risks. You know, there's lots of close worlds

932
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.649
where it gets to the false blue. But the

933
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:13.489
more reliable your belief form methods are then the

934
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.820
the more likely it is it will exclude high

935
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.489
levels of risk. The more likely it is that

936
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.620
it will exclude risk in close worlds. So you

937
00:40:19.629 --> 00:40:21.290
can explain a lot of why we care about

938
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.790
certain kinds of method methods, belief form methods because

939
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.379
they're risk excluding. Mhm

940
00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:31.889
So just before we get into education, then are

941
00:40:31.899 --> 00:40:36.510
there valuable kinds of ignorance? I mean, are there

942
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.959
perhaps instances where ignorance would actually be, be valuable?

943
00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:48.040
Yeah, I mean, ignorance is so for now just

944
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.739
take ignorance as I'll explain in a minute, this

945
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.209
is not quite right but take ignorance to be

946
00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:52.939
a lack of knowledge. A lot of people think

947
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:56.489
that it is well then it it can be

948
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.979
useful, it can be very valuable to not know

949
00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:03.000
things uh uh in the in the sense that

950
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.330
um it can open your, it can open your

951
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:09.209
mind as it were. Uh There's um uh there's

952
00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:14.649
a saying about um like sometimes when people, they

953
00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:16.949
know a few things, I mean, there, there's the

954
00:41:16.959 --> 00:41:18.459
saying I was thinking of a little knowledge can

955
00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:19.689
be a dangerous thing. I don't know if you

956
00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:21.629
have a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.

957
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.659
And what does that mean? It's like, well, you,

958
00:41:23.669 --> 00:41:25.399
you know a few things because you know a

959
00:41:25.409 --> 00:41:27.429
few things you think you kind of know everything

960
00:41:27.919 --> 00:41:29.590
and so it kind of gives you a kind

961
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.459
of dogmatic way of thinking about the world, but

962
00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:34.080
you really only know a few things. And so

963
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.570
it's quite useful sometimes to have that little bit

964
00:41:36.649 --> 00:41:39.790
more shaken, you know, like to be, have your

965
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.810
world to be open up and defeat has come,

966
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.949
this defeat is like, you know, new ways of

967
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:45.959
thinking so on and those new ways of thinking

968
00:41:45.969 --> 00:41:47.760
can, can shake up. And so you don't, now

969
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.209
you start to doubt even what you knew even

970
00:41:50.219 --> 00:41:52.669
though you did know it. Um And so in

971
00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.260
that sense, you know, ignorance can be a good

972
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.739
thing. It can, it can spur on. I mean,

973
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.540
it's very interesting in the early modern period with

974
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.939
the scientific revolution and so on. That was driven

975
00:42:00.949 --> 00:42:03.969
by the rediscovery of skeptical texts, pian texts. In

976
00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:07.399
fact, you know, people started doubting more in doubting

977
00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:10.310
more. It drove inquiry. Uh YOU know, there were,

978
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.870
there were some things they knew, but they started

979
00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:14.550
to question everything. Um BECAUSE a lot of what

980
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.469
they knew was grounded in tradition and religious authority

981
00:42:17.479 --> 00:42:19.479
and so on. And they start to, they doubt

982
00:42:19.489 --> 00:42:20.919
it and then they start to re ground it

983
00:42:20.929 --> 00:42:22.820
in, in new ways which are better ways and

984
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.239
so forth. So that's the sense one sense in

985
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.949
which ignorance can be a good thing. There's another

986
00:42:27.959 --> 00:42:29.540
sense in which ignorance is a good thing which

987
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.270
relates to um uh you know, it, which comes

988
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.719
clear once we compare lack of knowledge with ignorance,

989
00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.810
I think ignorance is more specific than lack of

990
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.340
knowledge. So ignorance is a, as I would say,

991
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.409
is normative. And what I mean by that is

992
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.510
ignorance is not just lack of knowledge, but it's

993
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.439
lack of knowledge that you ought to have. So

994
00:42:49.449 --> 00:42:50.939
there's lots of, there's lots of things I don't

995
00:42:50.949 --> 00:42:53.139
know right now, I don't know how many spoons

996
00:42:53.149 --> 00:42:56.350
are in my kitchen cupboard, but I wouldn't say

997
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.639
I was ignorant of them. I mean, why should

998
00:42:57.649 --> 00:42:59.199
I, there's no reason to know such a thing

999
00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.659
if I would actually, it would actually be a,

1000
00:43:01.669 --> 00:43:03.709
a negative thing about me. I think if I

1001
00:43:03.719 --> 00:43:06.219
knew that, you know, it would be concerning, you

1002
00:43:06.229 --> 00:43:09.129
know, II I, I'm not a virtuous person from

1003
00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:10.639
an intellectual point of view. If I know such

1004
00:43:10.649 --> 00:43:12.000
things, cos that means I've actually gone to the

1005
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.409
trouble of finding it out. There's no point in

1006
00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:16.750
finding it out. So mere lack of knowledge doesn't

1007
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.500
make you ignorant. I think it's gotta be a

1008
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.080
lack of knowledge of things you ought to know.

1009
00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:23.100
But what you ought to know as it were

1010
00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:26.120
is, is not a fixed matter, you know, like

1011
00:43:26.129 --> 00:43:28.979
we, I, if a child doesn't know, you know,

1012
00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:31.439
arcane facts about physics, we don't think they're ignorant,

1013
00:43:31.449 --> 00:43:33.090
we just think they don't know. Right. There, there's

1014
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.679
no expectation. There's no, they, they don't, ought to

1015
00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:39.000
know. There's no a for the child. Right. They

1016
00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.790
ought to know about the things they play things

1017
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.020
and so on. They don't need to know about

1018
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.260
this stuff. But, you know, if you're a physicist

1019
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.860
now there are all sorts of things about physics

1020
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.020
that you really ought to know. And if you

1021
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.159
don't know that's ignorance, that means that you've failed

1022
00:43:49.169 --> 00:43:51.860
in some way as a, as an Inquirer. And

1023
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.060
I think this is one of the senses in

1024
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:58.169
which education opens up vistas and in doing so

1025
00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:00.989
it makes it such that, um, there are now

1026
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.649
things you ought to know, like we hold educated

1027
00:44:03.659 --> 00:44:06.080
people to a higher standard of, of, of ignorance,

1028
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.610
I think, than the educated people because we think

1029
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.199
now there's a wider class of things they really

1030
00:44:10.209 --> 00:44:11.449
ought to know. And if they don't know that,

1031
00:44:11.459 --> 00:44:14.219
that, that shows a bad character that, that they

1032
00:44:14.229 --> 00:44:16.719
don't know these things. So this is the sense

1033
00:44:16.729 --> 00:44:19.050
in which ignorance can be. I mean, I don't

1034
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.949
know, like, so, uh you know, going back to

1035
00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:27.399
my point earlier, so lack of knowledge contrasted with

1036
00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:29.969
ignorance. Now, there may be things that I don't

1037
00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:32.129
know which are valuable because I don't really, I

1038
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:33.649
don't, ought to, I don't, there's no reason to

1039
00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:35.489
know them. So it's actually a good thing. I

1040
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.669
don't know. It's a good thing. I don't know

1041
00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:38.030
how many spoons are in my cupboard. You know,

1042
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.649
that reflects well upon me as an Enquirer. Um

1043
00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:43.860
So that's, you know, if we think it lack

1044
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.189
of knowledge is ignorance, well, that would be good.

1045
00:44:45.199 --> 00:44:46.899
But I mean, as I'm saying, actually, that what

1046
00:44:46.909 --> 00:44:48.689
that reveals is that there's more to ignorance than

1047
00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:49.550
just lack of knowledge.

1048
00:44:50.389 --> 00:44:53.090
Mhm uh But since at the very beginning of

1049
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.489
your answer, you mentioned, for example, the scientific revolution

1050
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.459
and how back then a few centuries ago, one

1051
00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:02.659
of the things that actually drove it, at least

1052
00:45:02.669 --> 00:45:06.639
in the initial stages was some people rediscovering uh

1053
00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:11.610
so to speak some skeptic texts. I mean, uh

1054
00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.449
uh uh one thing that came to mind was

1055
00:45:15.459 --> 00:45:19.139
so, I mean, I guess that there's a distinction

1056
00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:23.719
to be made between two different kinds of ignorance

1057
00:45:23.729 --> 00:45:27.310
because I mean, people can be aware of the

1058
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.840
fact that they lack certain kinds of knowledge. Like

1059
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.679
for example, I've talked with many anthropologists on the

1060
00:45:35.689 --> 00:45:38.879
show and I'm very well aware that there are

1061
00:45:38.889 --> 00:45:42.649
parts of human evolution, for example, that I I'm

1062
00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:47.179
not knowledgeable of. But II, I know that I

1063
00:45:47.189 --> 00:45:50.929
like that knowledge, but there's a difference between that

1064
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.360
and people not even be, not even being aware

1065
00:45:55.540 --> 00:46:01.370
that there's things that they don't know about and

1066
00:46:01.379 --> 00:46:05.169
that they don't even know they should know about

1067
00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:08.479
or that they even exist out there. Right.

1068
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.080
Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, this is, as I say,

1069
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.560
the wonders of education, it can open your eyes

1070
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.479
to, I mean, one of the dangers not knowing

1071
00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:18.060
what you don't know. All right, this is, um,

1072
00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.590
I mean, I, I, the, the, the, the we're

1073
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.260
all in this condition to a certain extent. But,

1074
00:46:24.629 --> 00:46:27.850
um, you can, you can education improves you a

1075
00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.280
lot here. It makes you more aware of what

1076
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.879
you don't know. Um, SO, you know more about

1077
00:46:32.889 --> 00:46:35.260
what you don't know but through being educated and

1078
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.830
that, so even though now you might be, you

1079
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.050
might, might, might be still that you're ignorant, you

1080
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.739
know, you ought to know. But the fact that

1081
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.540
you're aware of the ignorance of it is, is

1082
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.000
an improvement upon someone who doesn't, isn't aware of

1083
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.790
their ignorance. So that's actually a, it's like a

1084
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.360
lesser grade of ignorance. It's a better situation to

1085
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.870
be in. Um, AND education is really important for

1086
00:46:53.879 --> 00:46:56.239
that to, to make people aware of that. Uh

1087
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.560
I, it's one of my favorite saying actually they

1088
00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.780
don't know what they don't know. I mean, I,

1089
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:03.060
I think a lot of debates, you know, people

1090
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.979
would be better off. I mean, just think that

1091
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.800
I mentioned intellectual humility earlier on. It's hard to

1092
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.219
be intellectually humble if you don't realize how little,

1093
00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:13.399
you know, I mean, I, uh, I don't know

1094
00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:16.120
if you've been following, um, the, you know, this,

1095
00:47:16.129 --> 00:47:18.850
um, what was this conflict in the, in the,

1096
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.320
in the Middle East right now? And the people

1097
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.909
on Twitter wading in, with very strong opinions and

1098
00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:25.989
in some cases they clearly know nothing, you know,

1099
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.340
they know nothing about the history. Absolutely nothing. But

1100
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.189
it doesn't stop having strong opinions. They don't know

1101
00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:33.399
what they don't know. Right. Um, AND, and, and

1102
00:47:33.409 --> 00:47:35.879
that, that level of ignorance is actually quite, in,

1103
00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:37.899
in this case, I think it's quite dangerous. Um,

1104
00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:41.620
YOU know, uh most debates are improved by people

1105
00:47:41.629 --> 00:47:44.040
being more aware of their ignorance, of course, even

1106
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.479
better prove if they're not ignorant at all. But

1107
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.219
you can at least be aware of your ignorance.

1108
00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.360
So, uh there are many things in epistemology that

1109
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:58.860
we've talked about here, like the virtues, like luck,

1110
00:47:58.889 --> 00:48:06.110
risk ignorance. What should education actually be about when

1111
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:12.409
considering all of these aspects uh of epistemology that

1112
00:48:12.419 --> 00:48:16.449
we, we've talked about. I mean, what should education

1113
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.449
include? Exactly.

1114
00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:22.290
So education has lots of aims, not all of

1115
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.770
them are epistemic. So some of them are social,

1116
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.689
some of them are political and some of them

1117
00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:28.330
are practical and so on. But it seems to

1118
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.860
me a core aim is epistemic. And what I

1119
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.209
mean by it being a core aim is that

1120
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:34.429
it's part of what makes it an educational practice

1121
00:48:34.439 --> 00:48:37.419
at all is that it, it's directed at epistemic

1122
00:48:37.429 --> 00:48:40.290
goods. So, you know, like, imagine in North Korea,

1123
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.669
let's say they have, they have an education program

1124
00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:46.610
which is just indoctrination. They might call it education,

1125
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.300
but it is an education, right? Whatever that is,

1126
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:50.620
right. You might have the name but it is

1127
00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:52.800
an education because it doesn't, doesn't serve epidemic good.

1128
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.379
So what makes an educational practice an educational practice

1129
00:48:56.389 --> 00:48:58.340
at all is the, is epistemic good. So, in

1130
00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.889
that sense, the epistemic goods are constitutive of the

1131
00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:05.070
practice. They're, they're fundamental. And that raised the question

1132
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.409
of which epidemic ends. Are they a lot of

1133
00:49:08.419 --> 00:49:10.530
people, I think, think the ends are just, it's,

1134
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.639
it's what I call the bucket view. So, you

1135
00:49:13.649 --> 00:49:15.149
know, the student is like a buy an empty

1136
00:49:15.159 --> 00:49:18.100
bucket and the student and the, the, the job

1137
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.550
of the teacher is just to fill the bucket

1138
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.120
with facts and skills and things. And that's actually

1139
00:49:23.129 --> 00:49:26.000
an absolutely terrible way of thinking about education. It's,

1140
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.909
it's surprisingly durable, you know, in certain quarters of

1141
00:49:28.919 --> 00:49:31.090
the world. But it's, it's, it's terrible. And if

1142
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.080
you think a lot of old, you know, you

1143
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.209
know, yeah, Victorian teaching was, was wrote, uh I

1144
00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:37.159
don't know if this is the same everywhere but

1145
00:49:37.169 --> 00:49:40.199
in, in Britain wrote, learning, I know North America

1146
00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:41.600
is like this as well. So rote learning where

1147
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.800
you just get people to memorize things. Um You

1148
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.520
know, and it was done in a disciplinarian fashion,

1149
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.110
you know, like you were beaten if you didn't

1150
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.209
memorize things and so on, that's very much wedded

1151
00:49:52.219 --> 00:49:54.280
to the bucket model, you know, the bucket, you

1152
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:56.020
know, that you want a bucket and we just

1153
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.050
train you like, uh, we just fill you up

1154
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.239
and that's all that. It is. There's a different

1155
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.300
way of thinking about education now, which I think

1156
00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.250
is far more plausible and his education is sort

1157
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.060
of it, it goes this idea of education as

1158
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.199
Liberator, as, as, as, as liberating the individual. It's

1159
00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:17.199
very much entitlement, ideas of enlightenment, sorry, ideas about

1160
00:50:17.209 --> 00:50:20.360
education have sort of wedded to this, helping the

1161
00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.250
person to realize their potential to fulfill their intellectual

1162
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.100
potential. And that, that view, I think goes hand

1163
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:27.739
in hand with a different idea which is education

1164
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.649
is about cultivating intellectual character. And I would say

1165
00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:33.770
virtue is intellectual character cos we want students to,

1166
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.449
to think for themselves. We want students to require

1167
00:50:37.459 --> 00:50:40.370
the good habits of thought so that they can,

1168
00:50:40.429 --> 00:50:43.729
you know, make reasonable judgments and they can, they

1169
00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:46.000
can basically just think for themselves, that's what they

1170
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.959
wanna do. Um So it's o obviously you wanna

1171
00:50:49.969 --> 00:50:52.250
teach them facts and skills, but the thought is

1172
00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:54.760
teaching them the facts and skills should be grounded

1173
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.040
in a more general attitude of helping them to

1174
00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.760
flourish intellectually. Uh And that means developing their intellectual

1175
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.949
virtues. And this is something I'm a big fan

1176
00:51:04.959 --> 00:51:07.120
of, I mean, I think that's uh when, when

1177
00:51:07.129 --> 00:51:09.169
you look at good teachers, good teachers, I think

1178
00:51:09.179 --> 00:51:12.020
just do this instinctively. But what this provides, I

1179
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.100
think is a kind of theory. So a conceptual

1180
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.110
scheme for making sense of what good teaching looks

1181
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.489
like. I mean, think about how good teachers don't

1182
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.639
just give you the answer and they don't drum

1183
00:51:20.649 --> 00:51:22.429
the answer into you either. They want to create

1184
00:51:22.439 --> 00:51:24.310
the conditions under which you can find the answer

1185
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.350
for yourself. Uh It's what educationists call productive struggle.

1186
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.870
They want you to strive to get to the

1187
00:51:31.879 --> 00:51:33.840
truth yourself and they're trying to instill in you

1188
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.530
a desire to get there and a joy in

1189
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.020
getting there. Cos they're hoping you can internalize these

1190
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.360
traits, these traits so that you become the kind

1191
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.459
of person that's curious and, and drives your enquiry

1192
00:51:44.469 --> 00:51:47.040
and so on and indeed good teachers, I think

1193
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:50.590
tend to be virtuous, intellectually virtuous. They, you know,

1194
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.070
when you think about a really good teacher, they're

1195
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.709
often there are people who really care about the

1196
00:51:54.719 --> 00:51:57.010
truth, they care about, you know, accuracy and so

1197
00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.010
on and they, they instill that those kinds of

1198
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.250
traits into those around them. They are as Aristotle

1199
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.810
say, they're exemplars, you know, we, we, we learn

1200
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.280
the virtues primarily through emulating exemplars and good teachers.

1201
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:13.590
I think that's their, their virtuous, exemplars, intellectually virtuous

1202
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.699
exam. And uh and so, yeah, I've been very

1203
00:52:16.709 --> 00:52:18.479
interested in this, this whole theory behind this and

1204
00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:20.350
In fact, I'm, I'm trying to put it into

1205
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.229
practice. I run a project here. It's called the

1206
00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:25.989
Anti to Virtue. So the, the mascot of UC

1207
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.989
Irvine is the anti uh Peter. The anti is

1208
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.110
their mascot. So uh we call the Anti to

1209
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.919
Virtue. So we're, we focus on a core set

1210
00:52:33.929 --> 00:52:36.830
of intellectual virtues which we think are important and

1211
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.070
we try and embed the teaching of those virtues

1212
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.540
into uh our education across all levels. So from

1213
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:47.860
orientation through to graduation, uh you, we, we try

1214
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.050
and get give, give students sort of and faculty,

1215
00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.939
this sort of conceptual scheme to think about what

1216
00:52:51.949 --> 00:52:55.419
they're doing in terms of cultivating intellectual character. And

1217
00:52:55.429 --> 00:52:56.629
I think this is really important because a lot

1218
00:52:56.639 --> 00:53:00.110
of students, I think increasingly so they think about

1219
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.189
education instrumentally, it's just a means to an end,

1220
00:53:03.199 --> 00:53:05.860
it's just about grades and so on. And this

1221
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.870
is, I mean, this isn't good, it's not good

1222
00:53:07.879 --> 00:53:09.540
for the soul, it's not good for your well

1223
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.590
being. You've gotta think, you know, it's far better

1224
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.189
to be able to think that education is something

1225
00:53:14.199 --> 00:53:17.169
which is, is developing you as a person, your

1226
00:53:17.179 --> 00:53:18.820
personal growth. And I think that's where the, the

1227
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:20.389
virtue come in. We're trying to get students to

1228
00:53:20.399 --> 00:53:23.060
have this scheme to think more broadly about what

1229
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.030
education is and how it's gonna benefit them if

1230
00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.860
they do it well, it will benefit them whatever

1231
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.459
the, you know, skills get lost facts. Get forgotten

1232
00:53:29.939 --> 00:53:32.439
but the virtues stay with you. Right. The, that,

1233
00:53:32.449 --> 00:53:34.530
those kinds of traits, you know, once they, once

1234
00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.260
they're had, they're not easily lost because you, you

1235
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:38.939
see their value and they will, whatever you do

1236
00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:41.300
in life, they will help you prosper. You know,

1237
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.540
they'll help you do live and not just prosper

1238
00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:47.010
financially or whatever, uh, career wise but prosper as

1239
00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.010
a person, you know, in terms of your relationships,

1240
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.770
in terms of uh your hobbies, in terms of

1241
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.550
the, your choices, in terms of, you know, what

1242
00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.899
you do in your retirement or what have you,

1243
00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:57.270
these are good traits to have. So these are

1244
00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.840
the things I think a good education should be

1245
00:53:58.850 --> 00:53:59.669
trying to foster.

1246
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:07.250
So, are you actually testing that out uh empirically?

1247
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.449
I mean, uh how we can cultivate these intellectual

1248
00:54:11.459 --> 00:54:15.020
virtues in uh in this, in that case, university

1249
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.610
students?

1250
00:54:16.399 --> 00:54:19.219
Yeah. So, yeah, this is really quite exciting because

1251
00:54:19.229 --> 00:54:21.889
people have done this sort of thing in schools

1252
00:54:21.899 --> 00:54:23.800
a lot and with lots of good results, but

1253
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.300
no one's ever done it in a university. And

1254
00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:27.459
there's a reason for that. It's very difficult to

1255
00:54:28.209 --> 00:54:31.260
um change curriculum through the university, right? You know,

1256
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.209
academics are very much, they just do their own

1257
00:54:33.219 --> 00:54:36.300
thing, you know, uh they're very autonomous, but we're

1258
00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.409
very lucky at UC Irvine, there's a real culture

1259
00:54:38.419 --> 00:54:40.879
of um pedagogical innovation. We have a chancellor and

1260
00:54:40.889 --> 00:54:43.459
advice robots that are really interested in these ideas

1261
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:46.949
and So there's a lot of institutional backing for

1262
00:54:46.959 --> 00:54:49.810
us to do this project. So we're now embedding

1263
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.110
these modules in and because we're academics, there's a,

1264
00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.209
as you say, there's a research project about measuring

1265
00:54:54.219 --> 00:54:56.939
its effects. So we have a group of um

1266
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:00.969
educational theorists and sociologists and they're running a longitudinal

1267
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:05.050
uh empirical study testing for the, the empirical effects

1268
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.580
of what we're doing. So we have like, you

1269
00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.500
know, people, we have a control group of students

1270
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:09.800
who aren't doing the modules and the ones that

1271
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.469
are, and we've seen the difference and the results

1272
00:55:12.479 --> 00:55:15.560
we're getting very good and they, they, they confirm

1273
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.310
what you get in schools as well, which is

1274
00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.239
when you educate, explicitly, educate for intellectual virtues, you

1275
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.949
get, you get increase in educational outcome, you, you

1276
00:55:23.959 --> 00:55:25.679
get an increase in, in well being, which is

1277
00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.320
very important, but you get an increase in educational

1278
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.169
outcomes, pe students who, who do this, do, they

1279
00:55:30.179 --> 00:55:32.520
do well, whatever they do, they do well. And

1280
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.260
the other thing that's really interesting about this is

1281
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:38.479
that um when you have an intervention in education

1282
00:55:38.899 --> 00:55:41.020
of uh pretty much any kind, you get positive

1283
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.719
effects just because it's an intervention, right? You're doing

1284
00:55:43.729 --> 00:55:45.899
something extra. So you, you know, if you tell

1285
00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.350
you, if you take a bunch of school Children

1286
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.889
and you start teaching them French, uh you know,

1287
00:55:49.899 --> 00:55:51.389
another group you don't teach them French. Well, the

1288
00:55:51.399 --> 00:55:53.040
pe the students who learn French, there'll be all

1289
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.350
kind of positive effects from them learning something new.

1290
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.300
But when you teach the intellectual virtues, you don't

1291
00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:01.030
just get positive effects of the normal kind. You

1292
00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.889
get, you get like enhanced positive effects, it sort

1293
00:56:03.899 --> 00:56:05.760
of ripples out. It's, it's a, it's a bigger

1294
00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.639
positive effect and it, it's also one that doesn't

1295
00:56:08.649 --> 00:56:10.280
care about where you come from, it doesn't care

1296
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.469
about who you are. So a lot of times

1297
00:56:12.479 --> 00:56:15.129
when you have an intervention, educational intervention, the students

1298
00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:17.520
who are doing well benefit the most and the

1299
00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:19.510
students who are doing not so well benefit the

1300
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.290
least, right as you'd expect. But when it comes

1301
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.610
to virtues, everyone benefits roughly the same, which is

1302
00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.909
kind of interesting. It's a, it's a, it's a

1303
00:56:26.919 --> 00:56:29.469
kind of a, a, it, it's a, it's like

1304
00:56:29.479 --> 00:56:32.310
a golden bullet as it were. It's a, it,

1305
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.229
it has this magical effect of improving everybody's outcomes

1306
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.669
and, and relatedly, it doesn't matter. You, you know,

1307
00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:39.419
you doesn't matter if you're male or female, it

1308
00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:41.649
doesn't matter what your economic background is. It doesn't

1309
00:56:41.659 --> 00:56:44.860
matter what your uh ethnicity is and so on,

1310
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.500
but you get the same cos kind of positive

1311
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.600
effects. So um what we're trying to do this

1312
00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:52.879
project is uh obviously, we want to improve education

1313
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.399
at the Irvine, but we have all these materials

1314
00:56:55.409 --> 00:56:56.840
and we have this study and that the idea

1315
00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.739
is to make them publicly available and the study

1316
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.229
is publicly available. And so to try and we

1317
00:57:02.239 --> 00:57:05.270
want to change the conversation about education, higher education

1318
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.250
in particular, you know, what is the point of

1319
00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.330
higher ed? I mean, I think there is a

1320
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.850
real question, particularly post COVID. What's the point? A

1321
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.199
lot of people are asking this, you know, COVID,

1322
00:57:13.209 --> 00:57:15.760
everything went online, you know, why can't universities go

1323
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.209
online? Right. Why, why don't we do that? Why

1324
00:57:18.219 --> 00:57:20.500
don't we just have like, you know, online classes

1325
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:23.169
and, you know, you get your grades, why you

1326
00:57:23.179 --> 00:57:25.739
go to university? You know, um uh there's a

1327
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.100
lot, there's real questions about the value of it

1328
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.620
and I think we need to find, we need

1329
00:57:29.629 --> 00:57:32.290
to reassert what it, what's so important about it.

1330
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.699
And I think quarter that of our mission really

1331
00:57:34.709 --> 00:57:37.169
is instilling these intellectual virtues and showing how they

1332
00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:39.290
help people to, to thrive and to

1333
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:43.760
prosper. Mhm. So let's put a pin on uh

1334
00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.780
going to university online because I want to ask

1335
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.189
you a little bit more about what you think

1336
00:57:50.199 --> 00:57:53.510
might, might be the role of technology here. But

1337
00:57:53.959 --> 00:57:57.629
um I mean, uh one more question I wanted

1338
00:57:57.639 --> 00:58:01.550
to ask you about that project that you're running

1339
00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.370
is, do you have at least with the data

1340
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.899
that you already have, is it possible to tell

1341
00:58:09.909 --> 00:58:14.379
if these intellectual virtues that you are cultivating in

1342
00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:19.770
students would stick with them? Uh LONG term? I

1343
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:24.879
mean, uh e even after they finish university and

1344
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:29.000
for uh I guess uh ideally the rest of

1345
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:33.379
their lives because, I mean, as with other things

1346
00:58:33.389 --> 00:58:36.790
in education, I mean, sometimes it's a matter of

1347
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.090
people just forgetting, forgetting things they learned. Other times

1348
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:46.899
it's not exactly that issue, but more of an

1349
00:58:46.909 --> 00:58:52.649
issue of the social environment people find themselves in

1350
00:58:52.659 --> 00:58:56.574
when they're going to work and in other contexts

1351
00:58:56.584 --> 00:59:00.745
of their lives that really does not promote uh,

1352
00:59:00.774 --> 00:59:04.925
something that they have learned. And in this particular

1353
00:59:04.935 --> 00:59:07.935
case, I mean, I would be worrying if that

1354
00:59:07.945 --> 00:59:11.195
would also have an effect in terms of the

1355
00:59:11.205 --> 00:59:16.794
intellectual virtues. They were uh inculcated with, let's say

1356
00:59:17.439 --> 00:59:19.379
that's a, that's a really good question. And uh

1357
00:59:19.919 --> 00:59:22.399
to my knowledge, there hasn't been an empirical study

1358
00:59:22.409 --> 00:59:24.489
on it. We, we're not, we can't test it

1359
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.550
just yet. We, we're doing a longitudinal study. So

1360
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.810
we're testing it throughout the course of the degree

1361
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:31.879
cos when students leave, difficult to keep track of

1362
00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:33.340
them, we, we do want to do that though.

1363
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:34.570
That would be like if we're thinking of a

1364
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.590
follow on ground, we track them afterwards and see

1365
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.750
what happens. But if that's quite a tricky thing

1366
00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.820
to do, I mean, I did a project years

1367
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:43.790
ago with prisoners. We, we um the prison education

1368
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.250
project, we track students, uh the prisoners who are

1369
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.129
learning about the intellectual virtues have got the great

1370
00:59:48.139 --> 00:59:51.280
effects. But then when they leave, when I mean,

1371
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:54.800
just privacy considerations, we're not allowed, we just weren't

1372
00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:56.840
allowed, right? We're not allowed to track them any

1373
00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:59.719
further. Um, WHICH is a real shame cos it

1374
00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.639
would be, you know, lovely to find out. Well,

1375
01:00:01.649 --> 01:00:03.840
does it affect recidivism rates? You know? Do they?

1376
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.699
Uh, WE are, seems plausible. We had these big

1377
01:00:06.709 --> 01:00:09.979
effects on the prisoners, um, seems plausible that they're

1378
01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:12.120
less likely to reoffend. No idea that cos we

1379
01:00:12.129 --> 01:00:14.610
can't, uh, just so we would like to do

1380
01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.600
that and, um, and there should be results. I

1381
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:20.459
mean, intuitively, it feels like, you know, character traits

1382
01:00:20.469 --> 01:00:22.889
look like they have more stability than their skills.

1383
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.370
You know, I mean, one of the big challenges

1384
01:00:25.379 --> 01:00:29.010
for education uh is this problem of, of, of

1385
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.209
de degradation, a lot of what we teach students

1386
01:00:32.219 --> 01:00:34.389
gets lost and it gets lost very quickly. You

1387
01:00:34.399 --> 01:00:36.649
know, we spend years, a lot of money treating

1388
01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:40.389
people up in knowing things and having skills and

1389
01:00:40.399 --> 01:00:42.239
then you test them five years later and most

1390
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.280
of it's gone. Um But you see his way,

1391
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:48.370
it gets interesting because, you know, if going back

1392
01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:50.169
to the value of an education, you know, 11

1393
01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.080
conclusion, well, what's the point then, you know, maybe

1394
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.750
it better if they just did something else. Um

1395
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:57.510
But actually, you know, if, if, as I think

1396
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.750
is plausible, what we're doing in education is developing

1397
01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.830
character and the character isn't the sort of thing

1398
01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.290
that just degrades so quickly, which seems plausible. Well,

1399
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.189
then that would be with the point of education.

1400
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.129
So, I, I would bet, I would bet my

1401
01:01:09.139 --> 01:01:13.290
bottom dollar, uh, that, uh, intellectual character doesn't degrade

1402
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.560
quickly in the way that new skills and, and

1403
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.260
memory does. Um, BUT that's, you know, as you

1404
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.239
said, it's an empirical question. Someone needs to test

1405
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.419
that. Uh, MAYBE we'll get to do it. It's

1406
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.120
a hard thing to test. But I, it is,

1407
01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:24.889
need testing.

1408
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:28.129
Mhm. Yeah. I mean, the only thing I was

1409
01:01:28.139 --> 01:01:34.250
mostly worrying about here and if that's true, of

1410
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.929
course it would be no one's fault, I guess.

1411
01:01:37.939 --> 01:01:41.989
But, uh, one thing is for individuals to have

1412
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.610
their own character traits that they could, they can

1413
01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.090
develop, of course. But, uh, I mean, there's also

1414
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:53.479
the context, right? And, I mean, people are part

1415
01:01:53.489 --> 01:01:57.719
of a particular social epistemic context and, I mean,

1416
01:01:57.729 --> 01:02:01.840
I, I would worry that if, for example, they

1417
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:06.780
move into work and other contexts of their life

1418
01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:11.899
that do not really promote the flourishing of these

1419
01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:17.219
intellectual virtues and other related traits that if they

1420
01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:20.685
would really last, you know, because, uh, I mean,

1421
01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.324
I don't know if you agree with me or

1422
01:02:22.334 --> 01:02:24.665
not but I guess it's, uh, when it comes

1423
01:02:24.675 --> 01:02:29.245
to humans it's not just about, uh, the character

1424
01:02:29.254 --> 01:02:32.665
traits that we as individuals have. I mean, the,

1425
01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:36.554
the environment that surrounds us also plays a big

1426
01:02:36.564 --> 01:02:40.425
role actually in allowing for the flourishing of those

1427
01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:42.264
same traits. Right.

1428
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.149
No, I, I absolutely agree. So, I mean, I

1429
01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:46.750
have an interest in this, like, so there are

1430
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.709
certain kinds of workplaces that in, in theory are

1431
01:02:50.719 --> 01:02:54.540
meant to promote intellectual, like virtues like science, you

1432
01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.919
know, you might think science ought to be won.

1433
01:02:56.929 --> 01:02:58.810
And so one issue there is what does it?

1434
01:02:58.929 --> 01:03:02.639
And if not, you know, so if not, how

1435
01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:04.169
do you fix that? And, uh, you know, I've

1436
01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:06.050
written some few things about this. So, like, you

1437
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.479
know, in the, in the scientific case, people worry

1438
01:03:07.489 --> 01:03:09.469
about, well, you know, there's drive for results, there's

1439
01:03:09.479 --> 01:03:11.280
drive for grants, does that to what extent does

1440
01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:14.600
that undermine these intellectual virtues? And one thing we've

1441
01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:16.689
argued in a paper on this with a colleague

1442
01:03:16.699 --> 01:03:19.899
where we it would be good to institute certain

1443
01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:23.399
kinds of frameworks uh into, you know, there's some

1444
01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:24.580
of them is there already, I mean, I think

1445
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:26.429
some of the, the things about, you know, academic

1446
01:03:26.439 --> 01:03:28.389
honesty and misconduct and so on that kind of

1447
01:03:28.399 --> 01:03:30.850
important to speak to that. But you want to,

1448
01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.300
you want to develop, you can develop frameworks which

1449
01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.840
reward intellectually virtuous inquiry and so on. And there

1450
01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:38.250
there would be ways of doing that because you

1451
01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:40.280
can see how this would benefit the discipline as

1452
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:42.159
a whole, you know, to be benefit science as

1453
01:03:42.169 --> 01:03:44.290
a whole. If if, if people aren't just thinking

1454
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.239
about, you know, the the the prizes and the

1455
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.510
grants, but they're also thinking about getting to the

1456
01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.979
truth and so forth. And you can imagine a

1457
01:03:50.989 --> 01:03:53.530
similar thing might work with other disciplines where you'd

1458
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.850
want the intellectual virtues to be prominent, like, you

1459
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.689
know, journalism, let's say, uh, or, you know, government,

1460
01:03:59.699 --> 01:04:03.110
you know, um, the tricky one is where you've

1461
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.929
got, like, private industry. And, uh, you know, I

1462
01:04:07.939 --> 01:04:10.050
mean, even in private industry, you know, there'll be

1463
01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.919
aspects of it, like, there'll be a regulatory part

1464
01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:14.010
of it. You know, when you, you know, if,

1465
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:16.439
if you're in the sort of energy industry then

1466
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:20.250
you want people are regulating it to be directed

1467
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.030
by intellectual virtues to care about the truth. You

1468
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.340
know, if someone's regulating, you know, nuclear, nuclear facilities,

1469
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:28.070
you don't want them worrying about. I mean, this

1470
01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.209
is, I don't know if you ever saw that

1471
01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:32.010
great program, Chernobyl, there was a TV series about

1472
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.570
shovels. Just, yeah, I watched some of it. Yeah.

1473
01:04:35.399 --> 01:04:37.330
What was really interesting about that? Which came across

1474
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.780
quite vividly is that the concern for the truth,

1475
01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:42.639
you know, in it, they, they, they fell away,

1476
01:04:42.649 --> 01:04:44.909
they, they, they started to believe the lies as

1477
01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:47.689
it were, they, they sort of state funded lies

1478
01:04:47.699 --> 01:04:49.120
and as it, the idea is like, you can

1479
01:04:49.129 --> 01:04:50.449
get away with that in the short term, but

1480
01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:51.729
in the long term, you just can't get away

1481
01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:54.320
with it. And that's the Chernobyl disaster is like,

1482
01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:57.030
you know, reality is where, as they say, biting

1483
01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.250
you on the bottom sort of thing, you know,

1484
01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.370
comes, come back to haunt you, you can't get

1485
01:05:00.379 --> 01:05:03.889
away with sort of fabricating the truth indefinitely. Um

1486
01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:06.750
So there, you know, there's something to, uh even,

1487
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.239
even like in private industry, you know, you could,

1488
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.489
the, the, the, it's hard, harder I think to

1489
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.580
make the case there. But even there, I think

1490
01:05:15.590 --> 01:05:17.620
you can make the case that, you know, if

1491
01:05:17.629 --> 01:05:19.510
you, if you, if your, if your structures in

1492
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.729
your company aren't grounded in desire for the truth,

1493
01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:24.629
then, you know, maybe in the short term, you'll

1494
01:05:24.639 --> 01:05:26.639
get benefits. You know, people are sort of cutting

1495
01:05:26.649 --> 01:05:28.850
corners or whatever and getting results. But in the

1496
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.350
long term, it's gonna come back to haunt you,

1497
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.350
you know, you'll have people who are doing inappropriate

1498
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.860
things, you know, and so forth. Uh YOU need

1499
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:38.639
to a culture of can care for the truth.

1500
01:05:38.649 --> 01:05:40.399
It's actually ii I think is a, is a

1501
01:05:40.409 --> 01:05:42.600
way for us all to prosper, including I think

1502
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:44.409
even in the private industry case. Well, that's, that's

1503
01:05:44.419 --> 01:05:46.219
the whole other case. But you, you're absolutely right.

1504
01:05:46.229 --> 01:05:50.030
That context take someone with good character, force them

1505
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.560
to be in a social context where no one

1506
01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:54.040
cares about good character that you're making it hard

1507
01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.229
for them to manifest a good character. And um,

1508
01:05:57.719 --> 01:06:00.399
you know, you can, I think this gets depicted

1509
01:06:00.409 --> 01:06:02.610
quite vividly in novels. You know, there, there's a

1510
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.399
certain kind of novel, someone looking back on their

1511
01:06:04.409 --> 01:06:06.020
life and they start off, well, it all goes

1512
01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:08.360
wrong. It's cos they, they embedded themselves in the

1513
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:12.350
wrong kind of environment and they absorbed the, the

1514
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.600
values of that environment and in doing so it's

1515
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.260
like a tragic floor as it were in doing

1516
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:19.489
so, they, they cut themselves off from certain other

1517
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.780
kinds of goods, you know, you know, like the

1518
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.570
person who becomes career orientated in a way they

1519
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.580
never were. And then on their deathbed they realize

1520
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.780
they neglected the people they cared about, you know.

1521
01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:30.149
Mhm

1522
01:06:30.479 --> 01:06:33.260
Yeah. Uh uh I was just thinking also that

1523
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:39.250
perhaps sometimes in epistemology, philosophers also talk about the

1524
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:44.459
concept of uh epistemic responsibility and I would guess

1525
01:06:44.469 --> 01:06:49.219
that it's not circumscribed to individuals. I mean, of

1526
01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:54.469
course, individuals have their own uh epistemic responsibility, but

1527
01:06:54.479 --> 01:06:59.149
it's also a sort of shared responsibility. I mean,

1528
01:06:59.159 --> 01:07:05.439
our, there's a sort of broader social epistemic responsibility

1529
01:07:05.449 --> 01:07:08.270
that we should have, right? I mean, it's not

1530
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.870
just about the individual themselves but also about the

1531
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:17.429
broader social epistemic environment,

1532
01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.679
right? Yeah. And I think this is increasingly important

1533
01:07:20.689 --> 01:07:25.139
in the information age with the way like it's,

1534
01:07:25.149 --> 01:07:27.939
it's very hard and increasingly hard to insulate yourself

1535
01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:31.159
from the social world around you. And I mean,

1536
01:07:31.169 --> 01:07:34.020
think about the misinformation that occurs on the internet

1537
01:07:34.389 --> 01:07:36.520
and how harmful that is. I mean, I've, I've

1538
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.969
been reading some of these studies about like educational

1539
01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:41.709
performance in uh teenagers and it's dropping off the

1540
01:07:41.719 --> 01:07:44.389
cliff and they think it's, it's, it's phone use

1541
01:07:44.399 --> 01:07:48.560
and social media use. Um YOU know, the the,

1542
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.219
there's things you can do as an individual to

1543
01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:54.290
combat misinformation. But if you, if the structures around

1544
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.780
you are massively wedded to, to developing these, these,

1545
01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:02.020
this misinformation and, and, and leading you Australia and

1546
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:03.979
so on, there's limits to what you can do

1547
01:08:03.989 --> 01:08:05.739
as an individual. And I think then we need

1548
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:09.229
ways of, of controlling that, you know, how do

1549
01:08:09.239 --> 01:08:11.229
we, and, and it's a really hard question to

1550
01:08:11.239 --> 01:08:13.510
solve because we also believe in free expression. We

1551
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.129
don't want the state interfering overly in, in private

1552
01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.459
lives and so on. So there's a real trade

1553
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.410
off here. But I think, you know, I mean,

1554
01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:23.250
II, I, by the way, you know, like Twitter

1555
01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:24.680
X or what it was called, now, they'd have

1556
01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:27.140
these reader commentaries, you know, I think that's a

1557
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:29.660
really interesting development. You know, it's a kind of

1558
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:31.439
a, you know, it's not perfect, but it's a,

1559
01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:34.459
it's a good sort of democratic way of getting

1560
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.979
people to realize that the information they're being fed

1561
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.609
is at least suspect, you know, when you have

1562
01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.910
these reader comments and so on and then people

1563
01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:42.399
can rate them. So then you get a kind

1564
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.759
of, you know, feedback loops and so on. And

1565
01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.540
I think, you know, that there are ways to,

1566
01:08:46.549 --> 01:08:48.399
to mitigate this, but we, but we do that

1567
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.060
and these are basically their kind of their structural

1568
01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:53.470
ways of mitigating it. We, we can't put all

1569
01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:55.299
the emphasis on the individual because I think that's

1570
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.029
just too much of a demand. We have to

1571
01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.419
think of ways to make it easier for the

1572
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:02.488
individual to, to, to promote their, their character in

1573
01:09:02.499 --> 01:09:05.139
these epidemically and friendly environments.

1574
01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:09.979
Mhm. So since you mentioned social media there and

1575
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:13.209
misinformation, I guess that would make for a good

1576
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:17.740
segue into my last question then. So how do

1577
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:22.330
you look at the role of technology in education?

1578
01:09:22.379 --> 01:09:26.169
I mean, do you look at it mostly positively,

1579
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:32.370
mostly negatively and uh I mean, positively or negatively,

1580
01:09:32.379 --> 01:09:35.270
what do you think is the role that it

1581
01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:38.229
can and should play in education?

1582
01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.560
Well, I mean, one way I think about technology,

1583
01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:42.959
it's, you can think of it as like a

1584
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.270
tool and tools. Well, you know, they used, well,

1585
01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.549
they won't use badly and generally speaking, they're a

1586
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.459
good thing, but of course, they can, but with

1587
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.990
the provider, they can use badly. Um So, you

1588
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.259
know, like calculate, you know, with calculators come along

1589
01:09:57.270 --> 01:10:00.450
and then uh it used to be that people

1590
01:10:00.459 --> 01:10:03.770
could do certain kinds of rhythm, rhythmical calculations in

1591
01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:05.779
their head. People don't, didn't do it anymore. Cos

1592
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:07.350
what's the point? You know, we've got this. Uh

1593
01:10:07.549 --> 01:10:08.709
SO in one sense, you have a kind of

1594
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.020
degradation of uh onboard conti powers, but it, in

1595
01:10:12.029 --> 01:10:14.209
a sense it's kind of harmless because the tool

1596
01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.060
use, we're embedded in an environment where the tool

1597
01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:18.959
is available. So, you know, in a sense and

1598
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:21.200
I I would view that generally positive. I think

1599
01:10:21.209 --> 01:10:24.220
it's kind of, it kind of goes with the

1600
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:27.459
extended cognition that this way of thinking about the

1601
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:30.779
idea about the extended cognition is that we're kind

1602
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:33.509
of apt as the kind of subjects we are

1603
01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:38.379
to offload to our environment, um cognitive processes uh

1604
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:40.700
because that's the most efficient way to do things,

1605
01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.419
you know, you can even think of language as

1606
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.560
being a bit like this, You know, if you

1607
01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:45.040
try and do everything in your head, but then

1608
01:10:45.049 --> 01:10:46.799
you verbalize it and then you can write it

1609
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.850
down, you know, you know, writing something down is

1610
01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:50.750
a good way of thinking, you know, that, which

1611
01:10:50.759 --> 01:10:53.180
is kind of interesting, you know, like IIII I

1612
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:56.399
find, you know, typing is a way to, to

1613
01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:59.419
clarify my thoughts. It's like you externalize your thoughts

1614
01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.319
and through the technology and then that helps you

1615
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.109
to think, think more clearly about what I think,

1616
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.919
you know, if I try and do that in

1617
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:06.149
my head, it's harder and lots of things are

1618
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.009
like this. Um WE, we, we offload and the,

1619
01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.879
the cong and as it were, the technology becomes

1620
01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:14.689
part of the cognitive process and that's extended cognition.

1621
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.720
The thought is it, it's not just tool use,

1622
01:11:17.729 --> 01:11:19.890
it's more than just tool use there where the

1623
01:11:19.899 --> 01:11:22.430
tools were, become part of the technology becomes part

1624
01:11:22.439 --> 01:11:26.020
of the, the, the overall comp process. And, and

1625
01:11:26.029 --> 01:11:27.779
this has been going on for a long time.

1626
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:30.259
But what's interesting about the information age is that,

1627
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:33.490
uh, well, two things, I mean, one is massive,

1628
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.890
massive increase in techno in the way in which

1629
01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:38.529
we're embedded in technological environments. You know, it's not

1630
01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.810
just like pen and paper, you know. So it's,

1631
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:44.040
it's there but it, it's everywhere, you know, where,

1632
01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.839
you know, you think you walk through a shop,

1633
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:47.450
you know, you, you use the app and so

1634
01:11:47.459 --> 01:11:50.149
on and then you're looking up things and, uh,

1635
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.220
and so, you know, there's information on the boards

1636
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:53.830
and so on which is responsive to you. And

1637
01:11:53.839 --> 01:11:56.790
so, so it, it's a massive increase in that.

1638
01:11:56.799 --> 01:11:59.000
But the other thing is that as it were,

1639
01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:01.129
the, the, the, the, the technology which has become

1640
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:07.040
incorporated into your processes is information processing technology. So,

1641
01:12:07.049 --> 01:12:09.990
you know, like the pen isn't, that's not information

1642
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.839
pro it's just, it's just simply a me, it's

1643
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:14.120
like, it's a bit like, you know, the, uh,

1644
01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.180
a walking stick is a means to walking and

1645
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:18.720
a pen is like a means to writing. But

1646
01:12:18.729 --> 01:12:20.520
the phone, you know, your phone as it were,

1647
01:12:20.529 --> 01:12:22.899
which is that now like it's wedded to you,

1648
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:25.549
right? Most people, you know, they lose their phone,

1649
01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.299
they feel like this is an injury to themselves.

1650
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:28.620
And there's a reason for that. I think cos

1651
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:30.200
in a sense it is a bit like themselves.

1652
01:12:30.209 --> 01:12:32.299
It's like an extension of them, a lot of

1653
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:34.680
their thinking is done through their phone a lot

1654
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:36.910
of their cognition. You know, we used to memorize

1655
01:12:37.049 --> 01:12:39.200
phone numbers in our head. We talked about the

1656
01:12:39.209 --> 01:12:40.680
phone book earlier. You say you must be old

1657
01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.029
enough to. Are you old enough there? I remember

1658
01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.589
when I used to know, like, about a dozen

1659
01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.899
phone numbers. Yeah. Oh, I, I don't think, I

1660
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:49.259
didn't know, I think I know my own phone

1661
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:50.629
number. I maybe know what of it but I

1662
01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.279
don't know any others, but now they're all on

1663
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:54.569
the phone as it were. There's a lot of

1664
01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.290
that information that would have built in your head

1665
01:12:56.299 --> 01:12:58.310
is now on the phone. And so it's kind

1666
01:12:58.319 --> 01:13:00.279
of like an extension. It's like your, there's your

1667
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:04.100
onboard memory and then your, your technological memory and

1668
01:13:04.109 --> 01:13:06.180
so something very different is occurring. Now we've got

1669
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:09.549
information processing occurring, which is kind of like your

1670
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.149
information processing, but it's outside your, your head. Um,

1671
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.299
YOU know, like as long as do you know

1672
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:17.410
that phone number, do you know? So and sos

1673
01:13:17.419 --> 01:13:19.390
phone where you say yes and then you go

1674
01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:21.870
to your phone and that's kind of interesting, you

1675
01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:23.379
know, it's like, do you know it? Well, I

1676
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.160
know it cos me as it were is not

1677
01:13:25.169 --> 01:13:28.149
just me in my head, it's me and this,

1678
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.069
this thing attached to my body as well, you

1679
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.350
know. Um, SO I think this is the, the,

1680
01:13:33.359 --> 01:13:36.390
th this, this gets really interesting. Um And of

1681
01:13:36.399 --> 01:13:37.709
course, now, is this a good thing or a

1682
01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.649
bad thing. Well, I mean, generally speaking, it's a

1683
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.500
good thing if um the technology's reliable, you know,

1684
01:13:46.509 --> 01:13:48.279
it's a, and, and generally speaking, it's a bad

1685
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:50.330
thing if the technology is giving us bad answers.

1686
01:13:50.339 --> 01:13:54.180
So, you know, if, if, if it seems true

1687
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:56.490
that a lot of this social media is, um

1688
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:59.979
you know, it's, it's leading us into silos of

1689
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:03.000
thought, leading us into misinformation and so on. Well,

1690
01:14:03.009 --> 01:14:06.759
that's problematic. Uh It, it can also be problematic

1691
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:10.450
in another way, which is that um if, if

1692
01:14:10.459 --> 01:14:14.189
to use technology well means to be intellectually virtuous

1693
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.609
in your use of it. And this is something

1694
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.430
I've argued, you can't offload to technology, you know,

1695
01:14:19.439 --> 01:14:22.049
the intellectual character as it were, is, is about

1696
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.549
you, it's not about the techno. So what we

1697
01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.270
want to instill in people is good character so

1698
01:14:26.279 --> 01:14:28.910
that the way in which they incorporate the technology

1699
01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:32.200
is, is virtuous. And if you don't instill that

1700
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:34.370
good character, then I think what happens is that

1701
01:14:34.379 --> 01:14:38.009
the, the technology gets incorporated and it just amplifies

1702
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.959
the bad character. And I think we see this,

1703
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:43.319
you know, like people who have got intellectual vices

1704
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.990
who are prone to dogmatism, for example, you know,

1705
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.879
you get a dogmatic person and then now they,

1706
01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:51.279
they wed it to their phone and to the

1707
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:53.950
internet and the internet as it were confirms their

1708
01:14:53.959 --> 01:14:57.620
dogmatism makes them more dogmatic. Uh It makes them

1709
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:59.859
as l as lock would say an enthusiast, this

1710
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.870
is the worst kind of dogmatist. They, they have

1711
01:15:01.879 --> 01:15:05.560
full of passion and intensity to use the yeast,

1712
01:15:05.569 --> 01:15:07.580
his famous phrase, passionate tendency. But for all the

1713
01:15:07.589 --> 01:15:11.629
wrong things, you know. Um SO, you know, they

1714
01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.740
lack the humility as we were saying earlier, they

1715
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.529
don't know what they don't know and so forth.

1716
01:15:15.549 --> 01:15:20.020
Um So it's really important now, increasingly important, we,

1717
01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:22.709
we give people the intellectual virtues uh so that

1718
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.529
when they do make use of this technology, it

1719
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.790
we amplify the good traits in them and not

1720
01:15:27.819 --> 01:15:30.049
am don't amplify the bad traits. And of course,

1721
01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.450
it's also important that we have, as I mentioned

1722
01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:35.970
before, the structural uh constraints which help people to

1723
01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:37.600
be virtuous cos as you say, you know, you

1724
01:15:37.609 --> 01:15:40.529
put, put a virtuous person in an, an epidemically

1725
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.899
unfriendly environment over time, it's gonna be very hard

1726
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:44.390
for them to maintain their virtue. So you have

1727
01:15:44.399 --> 01:15:47.149
to make it so that it's not so unfriendly

1728
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.549
the environment that it does that

1729
01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:53.500
uh Great. So let's send on that note then

1730
01:15:53.509 --> 01:15:56.450
and Dr Pritchard just before we go, would you

1731
01:15:56.459 --> 01:15:59.140
like to tell people where they can find you

1732
01:15:59.149 --> 01:16:00.859
and your work on the internet?

1733
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.060
Uh Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm very lucky in

1734
01:16:04.069 --> 01:16:05.799
the internet age in that. My name is quite

1735
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:08.660
unusual. So it's funny like, you know, when we

1736
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:10.250
were growing up, it wouldn't matter what your name,

1737
01:16:10.259 --> 01:16:12.379
what you'd be Joe Bloggs or whatever And uh,

1738
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:15.500
so what? Right. But now it turns out having

1739
01:16:15.509 --> 01:16:17.490
a name that a lot of people don't have

1740
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.549
is a really useful thing. Cos then people can

1741
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.899
put your name into the internet. If you put

1742
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.189
Duncan Bridge Art Philosophy, I come up. Whereas if

1743
01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.049
my name was, you know, John Smith, it'd be

1744
01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.439
like a million things, you know, how would you

1745
01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.330
tell me apart? So, I'm very lucky on that

1746
01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:31.370
score You put Duncan Bri Philosophy come up. But

1747
01:16:31.379 --> 01:16:33.560
uh I have a web page which is again,

1748
01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.049
I think it's WW dot Duncan pritchard.org, which has

1749
01:16:37.169 --> 01:16:38.870
my papers on there and it has stuff it

1750
01:16:38.879 --> 01:16:40.700
has about my anti to Virtues project. If you're

1751
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:43.089
interested in that talks about the other things I've

1752
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.060
done like the prison work and so forth and

1753
01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.680
uh and my interest in education and so forth.

1754
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.629
So everything's there if you're interested uh by all

1755
01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.520
means, drop me a line.

1756
01:16:53.649 --> 01:16:56.299
Great. So I'm leaving links to all of that

1757
