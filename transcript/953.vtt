00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.719
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.850
joined by Doctor Kat Bohannon. She is a researcher

4
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.510
and author. And today we're going to talk about

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.789
her book Eve How the female body drove 200

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.889
million years of human evolution. So, Doctor Bohannon, welcome

7
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:21.549
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.469
Thanks for having me.

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.270
So tell us first, uh why 200 million years?

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.150
I mean, why do you go back to 200

11
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.270
million years ago? What happened back then? Exactly? And

12
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:39.849
why do you start the story you present in

13
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.709
the book 200 million years ago?

14
00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:46.939
Oh, because I obviously lack ambition and like to

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.680
tell small stories and like to make life simple

16
00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:52.290
for everyone in my life and for my readers,

17
00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.540
no, the reason um 200 million is because this

18
00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.979
is a critical moment in the evolution of mammals.

19
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.180
Um BECAUSE our bodies are well, they're just not

20
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.099
one thing any biologist will tell you, you contain

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.529
many different moments in time in many ways, the

22
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.410
body itself is a unit of time. And so

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.160
there are things in you that are fundamentally a

24
00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:19.870
part of your body plan and are very old.

25
00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:22.550
Yeah, your digestive system, there are features of it

26
00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.089
that are newer. Our intestines are shorter than they

27
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.680
used to be blah, blah, blah. But what it's

28
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.089
really doing, which is kind of squeezing stuff through

29
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.120
and digesting it and eventually shitting. This is very

30
00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:34.980
old. This is a very old thing that your

31
00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:38.029
body is doing. Um YOUR brain is very, very

32
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.319
recent. Now, parts of your brain are not so

33
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.430
recent, but a lot of what we think of

34
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.129
as characteristic of the human brain, the big frontal

35
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.760
cortex, all that fancy stuff that it does, we

36
00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.510
give it a little too much credit. The human

37
00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.069
brain is too impressed with itself, I would say

38
00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.650
uh but it is much newer, right? And so

39
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.629
when you understand that the body is not arriving

40
00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.239
all at once into this moment, we think of

41
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.230
as a moment in history, this body we live

42
00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.739
in that actually, it's a continuation of processes that

43
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.169
started a very long time ago. Well, then it

44
00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.039
really is a matter of picking a moment, picking

45
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.570
a point at which you say uh the things

46
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.770
I want to talk about kind of start here.

47
00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.789
Yeah. So what I wanted to do in looking

48
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.259
at the new biology of sex differences in mammals

49
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.000
and how they influence our lives as these very

50
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.220
mammalian homo sapiens we are today um was to

51
00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.270
go back to something around the dawn of mammals.

52
00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.710
Now, that too was tricky around 200 million years

53
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.779
ago because it's sort of like, well, there were

54
00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.380
harassments before that. And so why, why Amelia Forbes,

55
00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.220
why this moment would say a paleontologist might say.

56
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.410
And I would say, well, the funny thing about

57
00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.820
sex differences is while they are not only tied

58
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.690
to reproduction, they are often tied to reproduction. And

59
00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.850
in fact, a lot of the mammalian stories, what

60
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.789
a mammal really is, is actually very much tied

61
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.830
to how we make babies and how we keep

62
00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:06.779
them alive and of those traits, then probably the

63
00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.850
first thing to look at is lactation because that

64
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.309
arrives when we're still laying eggs, which is a

65
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.389
reasonable thing to do. Um But we start producing

66
00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.970
milk and that becomes part of how we bring

67
00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.000
the second generation after us into the world and

68
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.889
keep them alive.

69
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.660
So before we get into lactation and some of

70
00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.550
the other characteristically female traits that you explore in

71
00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:36.089
the book, um Do you distinguish here between sex

72
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.820
and gender? Because since we're talking about females, I

73
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.089
would imagine that by female, you're referring to sex

74
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.580
exclusively or not?

75
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.059
Yes. Yes. And thank you for clarifying. Um It's

76
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.619
good to do that right up front as you

77
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.160
know, I uh am very much of the camp

78
00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.389
that there's a strong difference between biological sex and

79
00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.460
human gender identity. That doesn't mean I don't think

80
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.279
there are uh physical or mechanistic drivers for what

81
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:07.130
would create a gender identity. I'm not saying it's

82
00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.059
um all in your head. You know what I

83
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.960
mean? I'm not saying that it's um and it

84
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.759
is by no means a mental illness, unless identifying

85
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.700
as a woman with this body is then also

86
00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.730
a mental illness. It's, we don't entirely know what

87
00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:22.940
mechanisms in the brain and in feedback from the

88
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.660
rest of the body, create this messy, complicated thing

89
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.000
we call gender identity. We don't actually know what

90
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.230
drives it, but we don't know what drives it

91
00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.649
for anyone so that it might be different in

92
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.660
some populations. Uh DIFFERENT, unexpected, I mean, um shouldn't

93
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.940
be surprising. The brain does weird stuff all the

94
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.630
time, right? Um And if I don't know what

95
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.540
it is that makes me identify as a woman,

96
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.989
uh you know, with these, this very feminine body

97
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.440
that I happen to have, you know, these uh

98
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.890
annoyingly large breasts and having given birth and all

99
00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.179
of these other things. No, it's true. I have

100
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.660
to put them in this like industrial garment just

101
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.119
to walk around. It's painful. Otherwise. Um That was

102
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.149
true of my mother too. You know, that's, that's

103
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.970
just the inheritance that I have. Thank you, biologist.

104
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.559
This is, this is just what I have to

105
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.679
deal with. You know, if I don't know, what

106
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.480
about that is making my me identify as a

107
00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:19.739
woman, then it doesn't seem strange to me to

108
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.940
say that Oh, yes. We also don't know what

109
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.859
a trans or a non binary person uh is

110
00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:28.579
doing mechanistically in the brain to create this gender

111
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.480
identity. But it certainly doesn't seem any less legitimate.

112
00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.600
But yes, yes. The short answer is yes, big

113
00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:37.010
difference between biological sex and human gender.

114
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.119
And by the way, since you mentioned it rends

115
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.679
women briefly there does what you explore in your

116
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.010
book also apply to them or exclusively to ses

117
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.459
women

118
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.049
depends what part of the body and experience we're

119
00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:56.149
talking about, right? And that's what's really interesting. So

120
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.010
we're hyper social primates, right? You and I and

121
00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:00.910
every other person we've ever met, that's just what

122
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.570
we are, which means that we are always situated

123
00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:09.089
in this social milieu. We're always coming into being

124
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.820
in our brains modeling because brains are so plastic

125
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.829
in our cultural environment and then constantly negotiating between

126
00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.010
how we identify versus how others identify us and

127
00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:22.309
how that maps onto how we live our lives.

128
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.529
We do this at every tier of our conscious

129
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.329
experience all the time, even while the brain is

130
00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.910
busy doing complicated invisible body mapping things to remember.

131
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.420
Yes, I have that peripheral nervous signal and I

132
00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:36.089
do have a hand still good. Just checking. We

133
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.079
don't pay attention to that us in the higher

134
00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.649
order conscious stuff, but it's going on as well.

135
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.010
So this idea that we would be um penetrated

136
00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:46.630
by it constantly. Uh Well, maybe that's the wrong

137
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.950
metaphor it's a bit of a masculine metaphor that

138
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.390
we're always in the web, always in the web

139
00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.609
of social influence is not surprising. And the reason

140
00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.470
I say all of that is that well, trans

141
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.010
and experience sexism too. Well, in fact, men experience

142
00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.880
sexism too. But what's interesting as a woman identified

143
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.619
person who's trans, right? Like as a trans woman

144
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.359
is that they have the experience of having this

145
00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:15.049
body that doesn't fit into how they understand themselves.

146
00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:18.790
Um And that understanding is perfectly legitimate. Your understanding

147
00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:21.269
of yourself is, is very individual. So is theirs,

148
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.450
you know, and, and, and yet they also then

149
00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:26.350
experience what it is to live in a world

150
00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:29.579
as a person who looks female, you know, because

151
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:33.089
of how they look. And so they experience sexism

152
00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:36.320
as a female person, you know, as a trans

153
00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:39.450
woman. So not a biologically female person. Uh BUT

154
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.309
they, they experience sexism in that way too. And

155
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.489
that's this interesting and tricky thing because of course,

156
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.290
they too experience the weird bullshit that every man

157
00:07:49.299 --> 00:07:51.165
has to deal with, which is whatever the hell

158
00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:52.885
manhood is supposed to be. And whether or not

159
00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:55.804
one measures up, right? Almost every culture has some

160
00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:58.804
very complicated set of rules that men are supposed

161
00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:01.834
to follow that are very poorly defined and constantly

162
00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:04.994
in flux, which are likewise shaped by sexism and

163
00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:08.649
that's built into the identity stuff too. So, right.

164
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.220
So which is to say when I talk about

165
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.579
sexism in the book. I think it very much

166
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:15.600
applies to trans women when I talk about what

167
00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:18.130
it is to give birth. Well, that doesn't apply

168
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.040
to people who don't have a uterus. But then

169
00:08:21.049 --> 00:08:24.320
again, there are biologically female people who are born

170
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:26.100
without a uterus or have had to have it

171
00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:28.459
taken out or who never give birth through one

172
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.170
despite having one. And so it doesn't, doesn't apply

173
00:08:31.179 --> 00:08:32.510
to them too. Right.

174
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.960
Mhm. Right. Right. I, I understand that and I

175
00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.250
guess that will come back to the sexism bit

176
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.799
toward the end of the interview because that's also

177
00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:45.710
one of the, I mean, not the trade. Exactly.

178
00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:49.799
But some part of the experience that women usually

179
00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:52.010
go through right in their lives. So we'll get

180
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.030
back to that towards the end of our conversation.

181
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.130
But one of the very interesting things that you

182
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.929
mentioned in the book and with, if I'm getting

183
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.690
this wrong, correct me is that one of the

184
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.580
motivations for you to write this book was that

185
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.690
you noticed and other people noticed as well that

186
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.580
the study of the female body is lagging behind

187
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.690
the study of the male body. And I guess

188
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.640
that is applies not only to biology, but also

189
00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:21.979
to medicine and in the specific case of medicine

190
00:09:21.989 --> 00:09:26.570
that might have some very negative implications, right.

191
00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:31.599
Radically negative. Um, ACTUALLY horrific implications. Yes. So I

192
00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:34.229
got, um, the deal to start writing eve back

193
00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:37.059
at the end of 2012. And at that point,

194
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.969
literally, no one had written for the public press,

195
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.729
anything about the male norm. And so I felt

196
00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:44.359
this incredible burden, you know, that I thought my

197
00:09:44.369 --> 00:09:45.969
book was somehow going to have to be this

198
00:09:45.979 --> 00:09:48.340
book and also a giant book about that because

199
00:09:48.349 --> 00:09:50.479
no one had ever heard of it. Um And

200
00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.530
no pressure because I was doing my phd on

201
00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:54.809
an unrelated topic at the same time. So I

202
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.909
was clearly not managing my life well, but I

203
00:09:56.919 --> 00:10:00.570
was so grateful when Caroline Criado Perez's book came

204
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.549
out that talked about invisible women that talk about

205
00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.450
this gap in data. Um BECAUSE it meant that

206
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.640
I was able to mention it briefly in the

207
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.809
intro to my book, not her book, but rather

208
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.299
all of the work that I had done about

209
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.140
it and then not have to have the entire

210
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.520
book be about it. Um It was a relief

211
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.530
for me and I'm so glad that more attention

212
00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:21.179
in other words has been paid to this simple

213
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.369
fact. But for those of your listeners who have

214
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.500
no idea what I'm talking about, we only study

215
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.090
males. Oh, for God's sake, we're only studying male

216
00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:31.979
bodies in biology. And that has only recently started

217
00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:34.549
to change, right? Because there is this thing called

218
00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:37.400
the male norm. Sometimes it's called male bias in

219
00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.549
biology. And what it is is that whether you're

220
00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:44.190
looking at rats or you're looking at um mice

221
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.859
or God up the chain, you know, to dogs

222
00:10:46.869 --> 00:10:49.280
and to pigs and to nonhuman primates and all

223
00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:51.750
the way up to clinical trials in biomedicine too.

224
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.960
We're only studying males and it's not believe it

225
00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:57.429
or not because of sexism. And as a woman,

226
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.419
I can tell you it's a relief to find

227
00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:01.609
something that isn't answered by. Oh, well, that's just

228
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.525
sexism again. Actually, in the case, it was a

229
00:11:04.534 --> 00:11:08.455
good scientists being good scientists because in science you

230
00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:10.854
want to control for your confounds, you want to

231
00:11:10.864 --> 00:11:14.645
make your experiment as clean as possible. You want

232
00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:16.945
to be able to interpret your data to know

233
00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:18.934
what these numbers mean. And if you have too

234
00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:22.984
many confounding factors, it makes your data largely uninterpretable.

235
00:11:23.044 --> 00:11:25.794
You can't do a statistical analysis if you don't

236
00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:28.119
know what the fuck you're looking at, right? So

237
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.219
that means if you have me sexed mammals and

238
00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:33.820
you know, one half of that group, you know,

239
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.609
the females has an estra cycle. Human beings call

240
00:11:36.619 --> 00:11:38.929
this the menstrual cycle. Yeah, that you have this

241
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.450
cascade of hormones that's specific to each species in

242
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.090
terms of the pattern. But you have this rise

243
00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:49.000
and fall of hormone changes that happens on a

244
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.690
semi regular basis, which influences by the way the

245
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.229
entire body. We're not just talking about the ovaries

246
00:11:55.239 --> 00:11:58.250
and the uterus. Almost every tissue in a mammal's

247
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.429
body from bone and out has sex hormone receptors

248
00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:05.929
uh and differing amounts and differing types and what

249
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.440
they do in any given body is variable, in

250
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.494
fact, but they are influencing it. They are changing

251
00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:15.155
how those tissues respond, they're changing how these body

252
00:12:15.164 --> 00:12:18.864
systems behave. And because it does that and because

253
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:21.094
we don't have a good understanding of how it

254
00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:22.965
does it or how it might be different in

255
00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:24.604
the male and the female. Well, that's a hell

256
00:12:24.614 --> 00:12:26.885
of a confounding factor. So it's not like there

257
00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:29.885
was this sexist cabal or people rubbing their hands

258
00:12:29.895 --> 00:12:31.734
in a back room going ha ha ha. We're

259
00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:34.340
not gonna study females. It's more like we're going

260
00:12:34.349 --> 00:12:37.760
to control for the confound of the feminine by

261
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.289
just not studying females, we're gonna study males and

262
00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:41.789
we're going to assume that as long as we're

263
00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:45.419
not asking questions specifically about reproduction in the females,

264
00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:47.210
like we're not trying to find things out about

265
00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:49.210
the damn uterus. We're just not going to have

266
00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:50.869
the uterus in the picture at all. That's how

267
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.349
we're going to make it happen. Now. That seems

268
00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:56.080
all well and good if you are not aware,

269
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.880
which in the very beginning, many were not that

270
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.570
actually simply having this different distribution of sex hormone

271
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.119
receptors across tissues that simply living a female life,

272
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.049
whether it's a mousy life or a dog life

273
00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:12.419
or a human life is in fact, very influenced

274
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:15.979
by being sexed. You won't realize that you're missing

275
00:13:15.989 --> 00:13:20.054
a very important of many different questions. So that's

276
00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.864
how it went for freaking decades. Um Unfortunately, basic

277
00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:28.034
science uh is precisely what leads to biomedical science.

278
00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:30.724
And so if you've never tested things on females,

279
00:13:30.734 --> 00:13:32.645
and then you arrive at a clinical trial for

280
00:13:32.655 --> 00:13:35.799
say a pharmaceutical intervention or what have you. And

281
00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:39.229
then likewise, in the biomedical spaces, you're not studying

282
00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:43.710
females uh for various reasons. Um Well, then you

283
00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:45.530
might have medicines arrive on the market that had

284
00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:47.989
never been tested on females at all. And that

285
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.849
has been in a word disastrous. Not every time,

286
00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:56.159
not every medication but of the medications where it

287
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.070
is mattered, which we're only finding out in retrospective

288
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.489
data. Uh It's, it's effectively been a femicide. It's

289
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.219
been, it's been horrible. It's been horrible in a

290
00:14:06.229 --> 00:14:09.440
word. Sometimes it's been funny and sometimes it's been

291
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.099
a matter of actual excess death and we're only

292
00:14:12.109 --> 00:14:13.840
just finally starting to catch up. But believe it

293
00:14:13.849 --> 00:14:16.210
or not, my book is optimistic and I am

294
00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:19.020
in fact a friendly and optimistic person. Um, EVEN

295
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.669
though I'm trying to rectify great wrongs. And so,

296
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.299
you know, um, we started to change the rules

297
00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:28.289
in science in the 19 nineties for uh medical

298
00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:31.090
trials, but then realizing that, oh crap, that doesn't

299
00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:34.609
help us enough even remotely without having the basic

300
00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:37.179
science also fill in the gap. Then the NIH

301
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.429
in the United States said, gave new rules and

302
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.859
said, ok, instead of justifying why you have females,

303
00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:44.510
now you must justify why you do not. These

304
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.289
are all good steps. And my book wouldn't exist

305
00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:49.159
with all the, without all the cool new science

306
00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:52.099
that has resulted inevitably in studying the biology of

307
00:14:52.109 --> 00:14:54.859
sex differences. But I will also say it is

308
00:14:54.869 --> 00:14:57.340
not enough and there are enough loopholes to drive

309
00:14:57.349 --> 00:15:02.039
whole truckloads of well medications through. So there's still

310
00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:02.799
work to be done.

311
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.469
I, I bet this is just women's. It is,

312
00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:10.359
it's women's fault. It's their own fault because they

313
00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:13.630
are them hormonal fluctuations and all of that.

314
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.940
Come on. We are just so messy and complicated,

315
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.190
aren't we? Um, WELL, male hormones fluctuate as well.

316
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.390
It's just, you're not quite so cyclical and that's

317
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.469
what's interesting about it. Um For example, we're more

318
00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:30.669
tied to the circadian rhythm, day and night um

319
00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:33.320
in our hormone fluctuations than you are. But you

320
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.599
also do have an andropause. You do have a

321
00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:38.270
decline in a number of different androgen signals as

322
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.270
you age. And that has been understudied too frankly,

323
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.320
which is part of why we don't have very

324
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.349
good treatments for aging males so we can fix

325
00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:48.830
this for everybody is the point.

326
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.729
Yeah. And uh just before we get into those

327
00:15:51.739 --> 00:15:55.210
pauses, the menopause, the andropause and all of that.

328
00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:59.130
Uh What about milk? I mean, how did, how

329
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.549
did it evolve? And what do we need milk

330
00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:04.989
for milk?

331
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.200
Oh, goodness. Um So like a lot of uh

332
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.460
traits in our evolutionary path. It has a long

333
00:16:11.469 --> 00:16:13.679
on ramp. There isn't a moment at which a

334
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.650
boob arrives like a holy descent from the heavens

335
00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:19.659
and then there is nursing. No, in fact, milk

336
00:16:19.669 --> 00:16:22.820
starts 200 million years ago, probably a bit more

337
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.239
actually. And it starts in this wonderfully gross and

338
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.859
weird way. So, milk is ok. What is milk?

339
00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:33.780
Well, early milk is probably a lot like what

340
00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.940
you see in monotreme now. So those are the

341
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.059
echidnas and the duck billed platypus. The weirdos hanging

342
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.640
out in Australia. Ok. Um So they still lay

343
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.099
eggs but they also lactate and have fur. They're

344
00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:49.320
actually little freak balls. We don't know how they

345
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.200
haven't evolved away from this, but that's what they

346
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.239
do. They are and are not like early mammals.

347
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.309
So this is before we split into marsupials and

348
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.950
placentals. Ok. This is really, really dawn of mammals

349
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.618
and the ancestors of marsupials and the ancestors of

350
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.500
placentals are just getting on board and every kind

351
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.680
of mammal is still laying eggs. And then however,

352
00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:15.180
they sweat out this fluid from their skin that

353
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:19.189
their pups lick from their bellies and abdominal wall.

354
00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:21.479
Now, they don't have nipples at this point either.

355
00:17:21.489 --> 00:17:23.910
They just have what are called Mammy patches, which

356
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.900
is true of the duckbill platypus too. So between

357
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.089
their adorable little bills, they lick and slurp milk

358
00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:34.229
from their mother's strange tummy after hatching from eggs

359
00:17:34.239 --> 00:17:37.339
that she's curled into her tail. Uh JUST before

360
00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:40.380
they give birth in this sort of damp burrow,

361
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.510
she's dug for herself. Usually by the side of

362
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.680
a stream. They're very strange animals. Ok. But as

363
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:49.750
monotreme, yes, they hatch and then they lick milk.

364
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.069
So the eve, which is the exemplar of the

365
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:56.310
last common species that had the trait. Uh, THE

366
00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:58.839
last common ancestor that I pick for the milk

367
00:17:58.849 --> 00:18:01.969
chapter is Morgana Don. She's actually a whole genus.

368
00:18:02.069 --> 00:18:06.920
Very, very common mammalia form, presumably laid eggs, presumably

369
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.300
lived in burrows, scuttling literally between the feet of

370
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.339
dinosaurs and she licked, you know, lactated her pups,

371
00:18:14.349 --> 00:18:17.189
licked milk from her. But what's interesting and gross

372
00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:21.239
about where milk comes from actually is um very

373
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.829
similar, presumably to well to sea turtles. Ok. So

374
00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:29.400
there are two different kinds of eggs fundamentally for

375
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.689
us land animals. All right, there are leathery eggs,

376
00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:35.689
you know, kind of soft squishy and there are

377
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:38.560
calcified or hard shelled eggs, which you would think

378
00:18:38.569 --> 00:18:40.319
when you crack an egg to make an omelet,

379
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.319
you're in Portugal, you seem to put eggs on

380
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.500
literally everything you eat. So you're very familiar with

381
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.109
eggs. Yes, you have a beautiful cuisine and I'm

382
00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:49.349
well familiar with it. So, um so when you

383
00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:52.920
crack an egg, you're cracking that um calcified shell,

384
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.540
that's what's happening when you put it into a

385
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.390
dish. OK? And that calcified shell is something that

386
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.280
has evolved in a few different lines in evolution.

387
00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:04.550
Mammals did not have that before they started what

388
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.609
we had were a bit like um a number

389
00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:10.459
of species that lay leathery eggs. Now, when you

390
00:19:10.469 --> 00:19:13.439
lay a leathery egg on land, the immediate problem

391
00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:17.130
you have besides that, it's more fragile. Right? Is

392
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.459
that it is more porous. You need to keep

393
00:19:20.469 --> 00:19:24.829
it damp. Right? Because remember that all bodies evolved

394
00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:27.079
in shallow oceans and we never got over it.

395
00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:30.760
We are very water based creatures. We earth animals.

396
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.260
Yeah. And so once we arrive on land when

397
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.640
we have these early moments when we're being laid

398
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.339
in eggs and we're not amphibians anymore. Ok. Well,

399
00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:42.900
you need to keep those damn things moist. Otherwise

400
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.390
the babies before they're done, you know, developing in

401
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.369
the eggs are going to desiccate, they're going to

402
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.290
dry out and they're gonna die. That's, this is

403
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.510
not a good idea. So, all leathery egged creatures

404
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.890
tend to secrete a kind of, um, well, it's

405
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.380
a bit like snot. It's a bit goo, ok.

406
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.219
It's, it's, it's like when you blow your nose,

407
00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:04.560
you know, it's a mucus. Yeah. Uh, FROM these

408
00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:07.430
specialized glands near where she lays her eggs, the

409
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.540
mother. Ok. So a sea turtle will do this

410
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.510
too. And it's a, it really is an incredibly

411
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.589
amount like blowing your nose. So there's this kind

412
00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:17.569
of mucousy thing that coats each of the eggs

413
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.869
and it primarily keeps the, uh, developing beings in

414
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.390
those eggs moist good. But it doesn't just do

415
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.500
that because, you know, if you've ever had anything

416
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.500
rot in your fridge, you may have noticed that

417
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:35.430
having things be moist and even remotely, not frozen.

418
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.209
Uh MEANS having things which are prone to growth,

419
00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:43.959
prone to fungus and bacterial invasion. Yeah. So if

420
00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:45.859
you want eggs to gestate for a certain amount

421
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.520
of time and be moist but not immediately be

422
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.359
covered in fungus and be infected with every terrible

423
00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:55.479
bacteria you can imagine. Well, this goo tends to

424
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:59.959
have a lot of um antifungal and antibacterial properties

425
00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:04.599
and this actually is the theorized origin of milk.

426
00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:07.770
Yeah, because when these creatures and they still do

427
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.760
it today, uh hatch from their leathery eggs, they

428
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.380
slurp up a little bit of this goo which

429
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.939
is still there. It's kind of their first meal.

430
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.219
Now, if the mother is there nursing, you know,

431
00:21:19.229 --> 00:21:21.920
uh kind of providing heat to the babies or

432
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.150
in the, in the den, as we assume morgue

433
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.699
was they too, would have slurped some of this

434
00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:28.775
stuff off of not only the eggs but probably

435
00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:31.064
off of where it came off her butt basically.

436
00:21:31.324 --> 00:21:34.744
So this actually is the dawn of the Madonna

437
00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:38.145
people. This is where the holy lactation actually comes

438
00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:40.875
from. It's from licking goo off of the mama

439
00:21:40.885 --> 00:21:43.785
and eventually in a long evolutionary chain, uh this

440
00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:47.515
goo turns into specialized stuff that glands evolve to

441
00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:50.864
produce and eventually it takes on some of the

442
00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:54.305
watery properties too and becomes what we now call

443
00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:54.984
milk.

444
00:21:55.829 --> 00:21:59.449
Well, I think it's just a beautiful story. So

445
00:21:59.459 --> 00:22:01.689
I don't see anything gross about it.

446
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.569
I love the idea. I love the idea that

447
00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:06.839
Eve and Bethlehem was sitting on a clutch of

448
00:22:06.849 --> 00:22:08.989
eggs. That would be wonderful and still a better

449
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.329
situation than we have now.

450
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.750
Oh, ok. So perhaps let's

451
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.020
just not uh that actually would be then. Of

452
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.140
course, Mary in Bethlehem. I take it back in

453
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.520
the Garden Mary in Bethlehem with her holy clutch

454
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.260
of eggs. Yes.

455
00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:25.369
Uh O ok. So let's trigger the conservatives a

456
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.489
little bit more here. Uh Can men and trans

457
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.260
women produce milk?

458
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:37.439
Yes. Yes. Now, if you aren't trying to, if

459
00:22:37.449 --> 00:22:40.609
your nipple starts leaking milk and you weren't trying

460
00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:43.410
to have that happen, go immediately to a doctor

461
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.209
because not only because of the obvious reasons that's

462
00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:48.479
not a normal thing to happen. Um BUT also

463
00:22:48.489 --> 00:22:51.500
because it probably means you have cancer, you very

464
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.790
probably have cancer. If you start lactating. Uh WHEN

465
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.390
you weren't actively trying to make that happen, there's,

466
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.020
you either have a tumor on your, you know,

467
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.359
pituitary gland or, or you're developing breast cancer. Uh

468
00:23:02.369 --> 00:23:04.989
Males can get breast cancer. You get it way

469
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.780
less than females do, but you do. So you

470
00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.089
know, pay attention to that stuff. However, if you

471
00:23:10.099 --> 00:23:12.729
mean to try to, if this is a goal

472
00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:14.750
that you have as a person who has a

473
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.000
Y chromosome, but means to lac Well, interestingly, I

474
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.920
found out writing this book, um trans women who

475
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.520
want to nurse their babies that they have had

476
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.579
born through surrogates or have adopted, take the exact

477
00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:33.680
same sequence of hormones that a si woman will

478
00:23:33.689 --> 00:23:36.109
do a person with two X chromosomes and breasts

479
00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:39.660
that grew normally in puberty. Um, WHO want to

480
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.800
nurse adopted babies. Ok. So if you're a person

481
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.810
who hasn't given birth for one reason or another,

482
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.989
you don't have a uterus or your uterus didn't

483
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.229
do the thing. Ok? You're going to take a

484
00:23:49.239 --> 00:23:53.040
sequence of hormones. It's a medical treatment um called

485
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.810
the Newman Goldfarb Protocol. I believe that effectively mimics

486
00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:00.640
the hormonal conditions of pregnancy and then birth. Yeah.

487
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.449
And in any given body, whether you are biologically

488
00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:07.589
male or female, it is very likely to work.

489
00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:11.280
You will very likely begin lactating if you experience

490
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.579
the sequence of hormones. Um AND you will produce

491
00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:18.189
biologically identical milk, whether you have a Y chromosome

492
00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:21.324
or not, it's been tested. Um Now you won't

493
00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:24.364
produce what's called early milk, which is colostrum, which

494
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.354
is just that happens in the first few days

495
00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:28.685
after one gives birth, it's kind of yellowy, it's

496
00:24:28.694 --> 00:24:30.525
thick and you don't make very much of it.

497
00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.564
All mammals do this in the first few days

498
00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:34.535
and then you have what's called mature milk as

499
00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:37.275
your milk glands develop. Uh YOU can't seem to

500
00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:38.734
do that with the protocol and it might be

501
00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:41.055
tied to something the placenta does. No one really

502
00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:45.420
knows. However, again, you will produce milk, you may

503
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.760
not produce as much of it as a person

504
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:52.500
who has given birth themselves. However, there are a

505
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.589
lot of people who give birth who have difficulty

506
00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:57.829
making milk. That's just a thing. It's wildly common.

507
00:24:58.369 --> 00:25:00.000
Um, NEVER mind whether or not the baby is

508
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.599
any good at getting it out of you. Mine

509
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:03.500
were very much not did horrific damage to my

510
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.479
nipples. I can report, I won't show you, but

511
00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:07.839
I can report, uh, it's healed, it's mostly healed.

512
00:25:07.849 --> 00:25:09.439
It was mostly bruising, but it was, you know,

513
00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:11.329
it was like, dear Lord, why is that? They

514
00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:13.439
are so bad at that. But no, um the

515
00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:15.280
milk that's made, I made plenty of it, but

516
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.760
there are many, many s women who do not.

517
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.329
Um So it's not actually, in other words, that

518
00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:22.560
far out of the curve, if you think statistically

519
00:25:22.849 --> 00:25:25.449
simply going through this protocol, no matter whether or

520
00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.319
not you are a trans person or non binary

521
00:25:27.329 --> 00:25:31.109
person, you will probably produce milk. Now, why you

522
00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:32.530
would want to do such a thing is a

523
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.810
totally separate question. Ok. I would say the same

524
00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:38.859
to any says women who want to, they're adopted

525
00:25:38.869 --> 00:25:42.770
babies having not given birth themselves. Um Wonderful that

526
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.030
you want to, I don't judge you for your

527
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.630
reasons. Um It is a difficult thing that you

528
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.290
are doing whether or not you have to do

529
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.060
it through hormones or not. Uh Lactation has a

530
00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:56.719
long evolved history but it is not, it is

531
00:25:56.729 --> 00:25:59.489
not the point of your being as a parent,

532
00:25:59.569 --> 00:26:02.119
you don't have to do this. But you could.

533
00:26:03.969 --> 00:26:09.729
So another thing that usually goes associated with, uh,

534
00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:13.790
I mean, organs that are capable of producing milk

535
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.719
is something that we, the guys and also a

536
00:26:17.729 --> 00:26:22.430
few females tend to be quite fond of these

537
00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:23.469
breasts.

538
00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:27.540
Yes. Yes. These big, like pendulous things full of

539
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.479
fat that just hang off the front of my

540
00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:32.900
chest wall. People are really into them. But,

541
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:36.140
but why are they there? I mean, is it

542
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.420
really just to please the guys or is there

543
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.099
any other reason behind it?

544
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.369
I think uh as of uh uh you know,

545
00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.420
I love this question and it's true. I've been

546
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.680
very curious. I would actually kind of love mine

547
00:26:49.689 --> 00:26:52.959
to be smaller. Frankly. They're annoying. Um But I

548
00:26:52.969 --> 00:26:55.030
just don't want to have elective surgery and they

549
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.849
haven't given me scoliosis. Some women have big enough

550
00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:00.770
breasts that it literally, you know, provides a kind

551
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.369
of horrible thing to their spine. And then surgically

552
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.079
it's very useful to just make them smaller. Some

553
00:27:06.089 --> 00:27:08.329
people like to modify their bodies because of fashion,

554
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:10.760
whatever. Um I've chosen not to, but it is

555
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.410
true that people are fascinated by these damn things.

556
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.979
Um So b is it for them, is it

557
00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:19.270
for men or not? Are they full of fat

558
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.750
and present in this very obvious physical way for

559
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.089
men or not? I think a first principle that

560
00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:27.560
is always useful in the evolution of traits like

561
00:27:27.569 --> 00:27:31.729
these is to assume functionality before attractiveness. There are

562
00:27:31.739 --> 00:27:37.150
actually very few runaway traits, um, that, uh, in

563
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.699
sexual selection. So a runaway sexually selected trait is

564
00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:44.239
something like, uh, the male Fiddler Fiddler crabs, giant

565
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.199
claw, you know, the one, that one crab that

566
00:27:46.209 --> 00:27:47.979
has the one giant claw and then the rest

567
00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:49.400
of his legs are just normal and it really

568
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.040
kind of sucks for him because he's like, what

569
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.050
the hell with this claw? Yeah. But he is

570
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.199
like, I got the claw though. And it's mostly

571
00:27:55.209 --> 00:27:57.739
because the females are attracted to the claw. And

572
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.880
this is the assumption, right? And so that does

573
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.400
seem to be a sexually selected runaway trait. But

574
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.239
the thing is in female traits, it's actually very

575
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.849
unusual, especially in mammals to have runaway, sexually selected

576
00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:15.260
traits. Precisely because our reproductive system is really, um,

577
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.839
costly. It's buggy, it's, um, complicated when things go

578
00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:23.430
wrong in the female mammals body, you know, in

579
00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:25.635
a mutation that, you know, has a thing, the

580
00:28:25.645 --> 00:28:27.925
costs tend to be quite a lot higher for

581
00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:31.915
the entire population. Precisely because we are the ones

582
00:28:31.925 --> 00:28:34.505
who make the next generation. So literally, if it

583
00:28:34.655 --> 00:28:38.344
makes us die or makes us worse at producing

584
00:28:38.354 --> 00:28:41.694
babies, then it's very likely that our species is

585
00:28:41.704 --> 00:28:43.814
not going to do well in terms of evolutionary

586
00:28:43.824 --> 00:28:47.800
fitness. Yeah. So the first of all the idea

587
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.750
that it would be a runaway trade is immediately

588
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.699
suspicious because it's like we have to lactate through

589
00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:54.930
these damn things. And we've already established in my

590
00:28:54.939 --> 00:28:57.089
conversation with you that we're, it's not a perfect

591
00:28:57.099 --> 00:29:01.130
system. Actually many, you know, these days I wonderfully

592
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.310
have the technological benefit of having had um you

593
00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:07.670
know, a breast pump to, you know, hoover Dyson,

594
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.430
like suck industrial material out of me, you know,

595
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.420
to then nurse my child, which is something I

596
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.380
chose to do. This is recently invented, this is

597
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.319
not. So in other words, if it is so

598
00:29:17.329 --> 00:29:19.969
common and it is for Children to have difficulty

599
00:29:19.979 --> 00:29:24.290
latching or for newborns to have difficulty accessing milk

600
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.770
because that breast isn't doing it as effectively as

601
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.500
it might have in, you know, among others. Well,

602
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.780
that child is going to be compromised, right? That

603
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.709
child is going to have problems. So if you

604
00:29:34.719 --> 00:29:37.670
think about messing with the boob just to make

605
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.250
it look hot, well, it better not get in

606
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.369
the way of the lactation because guys, you're really

607
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.790
going to screw up your whole species then. So

608
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.260
that's a good first principle functionality before attractiveness. The

609
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.660
best theory I've seen actually for why we have

610
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.739
the shape that we have this brush shape is

611
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.209
that it's really nice to not suffocate. Here's what

612
00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:01.699
I mean by that, the human face uh has

613
00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:03.780
a plane from the side. You know, uh if

614
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.949
you look at a human face from the side,

615
00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:08.150
you'll see it's relatively flat, right? That the jaw

616
00:30:08.199 --> 00:30:10.439
lines up pretty well, with the nose and the

617
00:30:10.449 --> 00:30:12.560
forehead, right. It's kind of like a, a semi

618
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.069
flat surface. And if you look at the profile

619
00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:19.050
of any given primate, including chimpanzees and Bonobos are

620
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.780
our local cousins, you know, you have actually the

621
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.329
position of the nose is a, is, is, there's

622
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:26.520
more of a jutting jaw. It's not as flat

623
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.579
a face, right? So when they suckle on this,

624
00:30:30.589 --> 00:30:33.449
you know, mammary mound that is pretty close to

625
00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:38.180
the chest wall, their noses are not squashed um

626
00:30:38.189 --> 00:30:40.369
against the chest wall. When they try to nurse,

627
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.810
they have no problem breathing and nursing at the

628
00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:47.199
same damn time, a human baby, if you were

629
00:30:47.209 --> 00:30:49.239
completely close to the chest wall, if you didn't

630
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:54.400
have a slightly pendulous, slightly manipulable, uh upturned nipple

631
00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.814
and a kind of swinging structure that can kind

632
00:30:56.824 --> 00:31:00.564
of move around, um would probably have to hold

633
00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:04.385
their breath while they nursed, which seems like a

634
00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:08.175
bad idea just as a design option, you know,

635
00:31:08.234 --> 00:31:09.785
that just doesn't seem like a good idea. So

636
00:31:09.795 --> 00:31:11.645
the best theory I've seen for why we have

637
00:31:11.655 --> 00:31:13.385
the shape we have is that it was easier

638
00:31:13.395 --> 00:31:14.584
for babies to nurse.

639
00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:20.300
And so when does the placenta come into the

640
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.180
picture? And why did females at a certain point

641
00:31:24.189 --> 00:31:27.880
just decide to abandon the egg because it seemed

642
00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.910
a little bit easier to just lay eggs?

643
00:31:32.209 --> 00:31:34.410
Right. Oh my God. It's so much better to

644
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.479
just lay eggs. Are you kidding this? Is obviously

645
00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:40.270
a better way of going about having babies. It's

646
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.839
actually kind of bat shit crazy that we placentals

647
00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:48.849
produce babies the way that we do because remember

648
00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:52.069
you're not simply like it's not. So what is

649
00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:53.790
it to have a placenta? What is it to

650
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.449
have live birth the way we do? Um And

651
00:31:56.459 --> 00:31:59.930
marsupials do. It means that you're not simply holding

652
00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:02.170
your clutch of eggs inside your body to keep

653
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.530
it warm. You actually have the damn thing docking

654
00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.459
onto you with a direct tissue contact, which we

655
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:11.500
call the placenta. So you've probably heard of the

656
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.859
umbilical cord, that's that tube that runs from the

657
00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:16.505
baby to the mother's body, but it docks, then

658
00:32:16.515 --> 00:32:18.385
there's a place where it kind of and it's

659
00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:21.114
very Guillermo del Toro. It's very sort of horror

660
00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:24.234
movie. If you've ever seen a picture of a

661
00:32:24.244 --> 00:32:26.954
placenta, it is, it is gnarly to look at.

662
00:32:26.964 --> 00:32:28.214
So I'll leave you to the internet to go

663
00:32:28.224 --> 00:32:32.744
look. But it's this fleshy thing that invades the

664
00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:36.344
wall of the uterus and you know, to varying

665
00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:39.984
degrees then interacts with the mother's bloodstream to draw

666
00:32:39.994 --> 00:32:43.969
material out. Um BLOOD and nutrients and building blocks.

667
00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:47.630
It's hard to build a body, right? So that

668
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.569
is um crazy for a number of reasons. It's

669
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:56.310
incredibly dangerous for the maternal body because now you're

670
00:32:56.319 --> 00:32:58.979
interacting with the maternal immune system so you can

671
00:32:58.989 --> 00:33:01.939
get runaway inflammation. Remember this is an invader, it's

672
00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:04.000
half of you. It's not all of you. It's

673
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.630
what's called a partial allo graft. Ok. So you're

674
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.670
somewhere between a baby and a tumor when you're

675
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.000
doing it this way. It's really, it's an invasive

676
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.750
process and of course, the embryo

677
00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:18.199
actually doctor House called it a parasite.

678
00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:23.170
It's not, you know, it's tricky. It's not only

679
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.130
a parasite, it's, it's fun to think of it

680
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.550
as a parasite. Fun because it's taboo and we

681
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.469
can make fun of how babies are. You know,

682
00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:31.829
I think I call them blood sucking demon fetuses,

683
00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:33.800
you know, in the human body. And it's true,

684
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.790
they're very, our, our embryos are very greedy and

685
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.550
our placentas are incredibly invasive. They penetrate the mother's

686
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.160
bloodstream in ways that uh is only true for

687
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:47.000
a handful of, of body types. Um WHICH is

688
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.400
why we menstruate the way we do. Uh So

689
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:54.510
no, the thing is um it's because it's a

690
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.000
partial all graft. There is some, you know, immunological

691
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.260
recognition. If you like it, it's made of half

692
00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.989
of our genetic material, but it is different enough

693
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.420
that it is also more like a parasite anyway.

694
00:34:05.579 --> 00:34:07.709
The point is is that to do that in

695
00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:11.090
deep evolutionary time and now we're moving more towards

696
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.120
the, the moment. So, so the placenta evolves before

697
00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:17.918
the asteroid comes down, knocks out all the dinosaurs

698
00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.409
except for a bunch of still unhappy birds, right?

699
00:34:20.418 --> 00:34:22.399
Like in that moment when the dinosaurs go and

700
00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.020
the mammals fill their niches, you know, um the

701
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:29.208
placenta had already evolved, but then it becomes more

702
00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.409
of a dominant thing, it becomes more of a

703
00:34:31.418 --> 00:34:34.188
dominant thing after in the conditions of the post

704
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.360
asteroid apocalypse, right? Where this, for some reason was

705
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.340
either advantageous or just not deleterious enough, right? And

706
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:45.418
for some reason, more of the marsupials ancestors died

707
00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:49.639
out because of that asteroid than the placental mammalian

708
00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:52.520
ancestors died out. We don't know exactly why. Now

709
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.850
kangaroos and all of those sorts of little creatures

710
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.320
are mostly isolated to Australia, except for some South

711
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.159
American places where they originally evolved and the rest

712
00:35:01.169 --> 00:35:04.409
of us mammals are, are doing live birth. Ok.

713
00:35:04.899 --> 00:35:07.729
The reason it's crazy, the reason it's a terrible

714
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:11.270
idea is that you have direct conflict, you have

715
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.810
maternal fetal conflict because you have one pool of

716
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.360
resources. And if you imagine that the uterus is

717
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.120
an environment, well, you have two beings effectively. Although

718
00:35:20.129 --> 00:35:22.909
it's a pro being when it's an embryo long

719
00:35:22.919 --> 00:35:25.979
evolve to both stay alive and compete for resources

720
00:35:25.989 --> 00:35:29.050
in that local environment. So, the embryo, because that's

721
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.949
what the placenta does has to somehow down regulate

722
00:35:31.959 --> 00:35:34.350
the maternal immune system to allow it to not

723
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.889
be treated like an invader. But the maternal body

724
00:35:37.899 --> 00:35:42.580
also somehow has to endure an incredible amount of

725
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.600
resources being sucked out of it on the regular

726
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:50.010
by a creature that's down regulating its immune system,

727
00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.399
which of course makes it more vulnerable to infection,

728
00:35:52.409 --> 00:35:56.030
which drives up its blood pressure Which, right. So,

729
00:35:56.149 --> 00:35:58.439
it's a problem. It is a problem to have

730
00:35:58.449 --> 00:36:00.780
live birth. It's not a great situation for us.

731
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.510
So, of course, we don't have time here unfortunately,

732
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.080
to a certain extent to get into all of

733
00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.229
the different steps of the evolution of the reproductive

734
00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:15.159
organs of the human female. But I mean, you

735
00:36:15.169 --> 00:36:17.909
know, something that the other day dawned on me

736
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:21.510
this f crossed my mind before was that I

737
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.689
was talking with a friend of mine about embryo

738
00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:28.989
development, about prenatal development. And suddenly it done done

739
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.120
me. Oh my God, we the guys are all

740
00:36:33.129 --> 00:36:36.659
trans people because we all started off

741
00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:42.429
inside a female body. Oh That's an interesting metaphor.

742
00:36:42.439 --> 00:36:44.649
That's an interesting metaphor. I can't speak to what

743
00:36:44.659 --> 00:36:46.320
it is to be a trans person and whether

744
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.139
or not that would resonate with such a person.

745
00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:51.929
Um It is true however, that there is in

746
00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:54.600
many ways, a mosaicism in many parts of the

747
00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.439
body where a thing you would expect to be,

748
00:36:57.449 --> 00:37:01.120
you know, statistically sex, typical one tissue to another

749
00:37:01.129 --> 00:37:04.429
doesn't always follow the rules. This is most obviously

750
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:06.820
true in the brain. Um But it seems to

751
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.879
be true in some other tissues as well. Um

752
00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:12.399
But we're only finally starting to get that picture

753
00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:15.439
because we're finally studying the biology of sex differences.

754
00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:17.719
We didn't know before we're only finding that out.

755
00:37:17.729 --> 00:37:18.080
Now.

756
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.649
Uh So another interesting thing here that you talk

757
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:26.719
about in the book is the female orgasm. So,

758
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.459
I mean, I guess that some pe some people

759
00:37:29.469 --> 00:37:33.439
would be wondering why do you need these orgasms

760
00:37:33.449 --> 00:37:35.239
for? Exactly. And

761
00:37:35.439 --> 00:37:36.429
how female are the ma

762
00:37:37.409 --> 00:37:38.580
uh the female?

763
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:44.330
Ah OK. OK. Well, I mean, on 1st, 1st

764
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.020
principle, the reason for the female orgasm is that

765
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:51.840
females uh have pleasure and uh that pleasure should

766
00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.774
be valued. Thank you very much. Um THAT I've

767
00:37:55.784 --> 00:37:58.024
heard of that, but just it's worth saying, I

768
00:37:58.034 --> 00:38:00.544
feel like it's worth saying anywhere because at some

769
00:38:00.554 --> 00:38:03.574
point, maybe we'll all finally believe it. OK. So

770
00:38:03.584 --> 00:38:05.584
there's that, but I think you were probably trying

771
00:38:05.594 --> 00:38:08.284
to ask me uh as someone representing the science

772
00:38:08.294 --> 00:38:13.074
behind it. Um Right. Yeah. So unfortunately, um female

773
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:17.814
typical orgasms there. This was a beautiful little paper

774
00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:21.385
um that came out some years ago seemed to

775
00:38:21.395 --> 00:38:26.350
be tied to ovulation. Um Once upon a time,

776
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.070
uh the female orgasm may well have triggered uh

777
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.050
the fo the egg follicle, you know, the developed

778
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.379
egg uh hatching as it were out of the

779
00:38:36.389 --> 00:38:38.870
ovary and making its way into the fallopian tube.

780
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.899
Um You can still see a little bit of

781
00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:43.770
this in the rabbit actually. So one of the

782
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.550
reasons that rabbits have so many babies, that's the

783
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.149
stereotype why we love to uh say the Easter

784
00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:53.169
bunny is a rabbit because of Ancient Roman fertility

785
00:38:53.409 --> 00:38:56.929
uh rights. And why we associate them with just,

786
00:38:56.939 --> 00:38:59.709
you know, sex and babies in general is because

787
00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:03.439
they ovulate in response to coitus, they get laid

788
00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:06.120
and they immediately ovulate. That's how it works in

789
00:39:06.129 --> 00:39:08.300
them. They don't have the estra cycle the way

790
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.770
we do in that they, you know, are only

791
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.820
fertile for a little bit. They uh could potentially

792
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.760
be fertile whenever they have sex. Ok. And so

793
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.476
the female orgasm uh seems in deep, deep time,

794
00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:22.355
not just because of rabbits. This is also true,

795
00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:25.006
I think, uh in a few other system, few

796
00:39:25.016 --> 00:39:28.976
other body plants um to release an egg. Now,

797
00:39:28.986 --> 00:39:33.075
thankfully, uh just birth control alone. Um That is

798
00:39:33.085 --> 00:39:35.275
no longer the case. These things have been decoupled.

799
00:39:35.486 --> 00:39:37.686
OK. And uh in the human body, the female

800
00:39:37.696 --> 00:39:41.781
orgasm is not at all time to ovulation. It

801
00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:45.632
is tied to our sense of satisfaction. It is

802
00:39:45.642 --> 00:39:49.471
tied to potentially bonding with our mates. Maybe sometimes

803
00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:53.001
it's tied to enjoying the very messy and often

804
00:39:53.011 --> 00:39:55.471
unpleasant process of living in a body and being

805
00:39:55.481 --> 00:39:57.951
mortal. It's tied to all those things, but it's

806
00:39:57.961 --> 00:39:59.912
not tied to ovulation anymore.

807
00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:03.879
So it's just for a pleasure then.

808
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.060
Yes.

809
00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:08.729
Oh my God. That's really.

810
00:40:09.459 --> 00:40:14.629
Now, now that said we often confusingly tie what

811
00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:17.530
we call the neurological condition of having an orgasm,

812
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.919
you know, getting past the breakers, the wave, the

813
00:40:19.929 --> 00:40:22.469
arriving at the moment and the trumpet sound, whatever

814
00:40:22.479 --> 00:40:25.500
your metaphor is fine, you know, we, we confuse

815
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:30.969
sexual arousal and orgasm in that um It is

816
00:40:30.979 --> 00:40:33.860
not the, it is not the case that a

817
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:38.439
woman cannot enjoy sex without having had an orgasm.

818
00:40:38.449 --> 00:40:41.159
In that classic sense. Lots of us do. And

819
00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:45.370
unfortunately, many of us won't even experience our first

820
00:40:45.379 --> 00:40:48.320
orgasm until later in life. In part, because we've

821
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.629
had many lousy lovers who have no idea what

822
00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:53.429
a clitoris is fine. Um But also, uh you

823
00:40:53.439 --> 00:40:56.229
know, there's, there's like sexism and there's just gender

824
00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:58.989
mess and there's just, and there's also the simple

825
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.909
fact from what studies have been done on it,

826
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.620
that the vast majority of women uh do not

827
00:41:03.629 --> 00:41:07.870
have orgasms uh without clitoral stimulation, simply penetration uh

828
00:41:07.879 --> 00:41:11.429
tends not to, in part because uh the vagina

829
00:41:11.439 --> 00:41:14.570
itself doesn't have as many nerves in it. Um

830
00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:17.290
So it's not, it's not as dense a signal

831
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.510
as, as you like as the, as the clitoris

832
00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.689
and its extended structure. Some women do have uh

833
00:41:22.699 --> 00:41:26.100
some people with vaginas do have orgasms from penetration,

834
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:32.239
but usually that's not uh sufficient. So anyway, now

835
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.510
you've had that little bit of uh public service

836
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.280
announcement for what female orgasms are for and how

837
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:37.810
they work.

838
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.100
But, but you know, this is highly controversial because

839
00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.330
I've heard that there's a book or several books

840
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.989
out there where s where people claim that uh

841
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.810
non reproductive sex is a sin. So that, that

842
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.239
should be a problem. No.

843
00:41:55.889 --> 00:41:58.810
Oh, well, you see, I thought it was a

844
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.110
sin to make people suffer unnecessarily. I thought the

845
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.439
greatest sin actually was to make other people's lives

846
00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:11.590
worse, uh in obvious and measurable ways, which is

847
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.500
to say, II I thought, um, devaluing the pleasure

848
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:18.610
of others lives and devaluing the existence of people

849
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.689
who are not like yourself was the greatest sin,

850
00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:22.510
but perhaps I'm confused.

851
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.820
Uh uh Yeah, perhaps you are a and, and

852
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.919
something that I would imagine is not exactly for

853
00:42:29.929 --> 00:42:33.479
the sake of your pleasure is menstruation. So

854
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.060
some people are into that me, not particularly, um

855
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.030
there is a whole subset of people who are

856
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.040
really, really into it. Um And uh and not

857
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.020
simply in kink space, but just in the experience

858
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.100
of having a body and I respect them personally.

859
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.810
Uh I, I, I'm happy to not have a

860
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.969
whole lot of it. I have an IUD and

861
00:42:52.979 --> 00:42:55.010
so that thins the lining of my uterus. And

862
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.540
that means that at this point, I I experience

863
00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:01.500
very little um externally obvious uh menstruation that is

864
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.360
different for every patient, of course. Um But no,

865
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:08.600
I um the point of menstruation actually uh is

866
00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.629
to build a barrier between the maternal body and

867
00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:15.090
the incoming fetus. The reason we build up the

868
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.639
lining of the uterus is precisely because we have

869
00:43:17.649 --> 00:43:21.810
a very, very invasive placenta in our species. And

870
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.510
so um if we didn't do that, we might

871
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.530
well die, you know, uh trying to become pregnant

872
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.850
if we do, hopefully choose, hopefully, it is a

873
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.409
choice uh become pregnant without having built up that

874
00:43:32.419 --> 00:43:34.229
lining. And it's just the, why we shed it

875
00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:37.840
externally, uh as opposed to reabsorb, it, most species

876
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.419
that do this reabsorb, it just so, you know,

877
00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:44.340
um, it just is probably more, uh, you know,

878
00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.300
it, it's a cost, uh, it's a cost analysis

879
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.929
for whatever reason, our bodies evolved in a way

880
00:43:49.939 --> 00:43:51.840
that it was less costly to just shed the

881
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.679
stuff than to just uh resorb it. Um, WHEN,

882
00:43:55.689 --> 00:43:58.370
when we're done using it, who knows why we're

883
00:43:58.379 --> 00:43:58.959
stuck with it.

884
00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:03.199
So, one of the things that really, I I

885
00:44:03.209 --> 00:44:05.810
mean, I wasn't expecting for you to cover in

886
00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.520
the book. It surprised me was primate perception and

887
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.439
female perception. So why is it that you also

888
00:44:14.449 --> 00:44:18.250
talk about that specifically? I mean, are there some

889
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:23.520
important ways by which uh female perception differs from

890
00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:24.760
male perception?

891
00:44:26.169 --> 00:44:28.989
Well, there were two, there were two reasons why

892
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.909
um the first and obvious reason is that um

893
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.770
I was interested in whether or not there was

894
00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.639
anything important in sex differences. Uh At that moment,

895
00:44:39.649 --> 00:44:43.810
we become primates when our ancestral line uh evolves

896
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.219
out of uh merely mammals and early primates arrive.

897
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.209
And what about the story of their evolution may

898
00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:55.310
or may not apply to sex differences? Um BECAUSE

899
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.939
you and I are equally primate. Um But we

900
00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:00.810
are also sex. So OK, so what was interesting

901
00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.520
about that moment to me um the arrival of

902
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:07.300
primates is that it's very much a perception story

903
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.060
now by perception, I mean, our sensory array. OK?

904
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:13.280
I don't just mean our cultural perception just to

905
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.659
clarify. I mean, you know, this thing we call

906
00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:18.139
a sensory array which is effectively your head, your

907
00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:21.520
face. You know, you, you hang your sensors, your

908
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.899
primary sensors on this very usefully swivel, you know,

909
00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:27.590
part of your body that you can turn in

910
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.540
one direction or another and has ears on either

911
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.439
side of it and eyes towards the front and,

912
00:45:31.449 --> 00:45:33.520
and the nose and the mouth right centrally and

913
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:36.179
there you are, that's your sensory array, perceiving the

914
00:45:36.189 --> 00:45:39.270
world around you in varying degrees specific to your

915
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.250
species. What's interesting about primates as this is a

916
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.189
moment where we really are evolving in the trees,

917
00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:50.989
specifically in angiosperm forest. So this is something that's

918
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.810
a bit new after the apocalypse uh that killed

919
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.870
off the dinosaurs in the smoking holes that were

920
00:45:56.879 --> 00:46:00.729
left. Um A bunch of fruiting trees uh took

921
00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:05.314
hold and created these incredible canopies uh full of

922
00:46:05.324 --> 00:46:09.004
delicious hanging fruit that of course many different species

923
00:46:09.014 --> 00:46:12.965
that evolve to um eat and then of course

924
00:46:12.975 --> 00:46:15.415
beneficial to the trees, uh poop out their seeds

925
00:46:15.425 --> 00:46:18.064
in various spots making hence new trees, right? So

926
00:46:18.074 --> 00:46:22.004
there's this long messy process of creatures taking advantage

927
00:46:22.014 --> 00:46:26.389
of this new environmental condition, this new ecosystem is

928
00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:30.080
growing and primates are very, very much a part

929
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.360
of it. So, one of the best theory goings

930
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.000
I think for why primates are the way they

931
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.659
are. Um MANY features of our bodies is that

932
00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:42.969
we evolved to eat fruit in angiosperms hanging on

933
00:46:42.979 --> 00:46:45.304
what's called the distal branch. The more the thinner

934
00:46:45.314 --> 00:46:47.514
branches where the fruit is, you know, out towards

935
00:46:47.524 --> 00:46:52.354
there. So our pro proprioception, our ability to move.

936
00:46:52.364 --> 00:46:54.614
Uh THAT so many of us have these grasping

937
00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:57.155
hands. Of course, most primates are still in the

938
00:46:57.165 --> 00:46:59.205
trees, not all but many, we still have that

939
00:46:59.284 --> 00:47:02.814
opposable thumb, that grasping thing that grabs on to

940
00:47:02.824 --> 00:47:06.195
a branch. Um And also our perception, however, because

941
00:47:06.205 --> 00:47:09.495
optimizing to eat, not just bugs anymore, which a

942
00:47:09.504 --> 00:47:11.824
lot of early mammals did. We were insectivores, but

943
00:47:11.834 --> 00:47:15.290
also fruit. Now means being able to tell when

944
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.419
tender leaves and ripe fruit are ripe, which means

945
00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:20.629
you have to see color in a certain way.

946
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:25.780
Um It means having to hear and see things

947
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.989
in this complicated environment that isn't just back and

948
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.229
forth, but up and down very 3d. Once you

949
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.000
live in the trees, that's a very different sensory

950
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.489
environment than when you're scuttling along the ground and

951
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.250
living in burrows, right? So, um so there, so

952
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.719
it seemed to me that the moment we become

953
00:47:42.729 --> 00:47:45.580
primates is really deeply about trees, it's really about

954
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.659
our sensory array. And because there are known sex

955
00:47:48.669 --> 00:47:54.020
differences in primates um for our sensory array, slight

956
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.899
differences in our visual perception, slight differences in our

957
00:47:56.909 --> 00:47:59.989
hearing and a little bit in our noses, olfaction

958
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.750
too. Um That seems like an important story to

959
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.139
tell

960
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.830
uh and I, I mean those stories that sometimes

961
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.370
we hear about women, uh when it comes to

962
00:48:12.379 --> 00:48:16.280
color vision, being able to distinguish between more colors

963
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.379
than men and seeing more colors. And when it

964
00:48:19.389 --> 00:48:23.649
comes to smell, being more sensitive to smell and

965
00:48:23.659 --> 00:48:28.000
being able to identify uh different uh more smells

966
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:32.189
than more odors than men. Is that true?

967
00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:37.250
Yes, actually, but not always in the ways you

968
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.550
might think and not always for the reasons you

969
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.419
might think. Now, when it comes to vision, when

970
00:48:42.429 --> 00:48:46.179
it comes to our eyeballs, there are certain kinds

971
00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:49.669
of color blindness that are X linked traits, which

972
00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:51.810
means that if you only have one X chromosome,

973
00:48:51.879 --> 00:48:54.669
you're more likely. So there is a male typical

974
00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:57.840
color blindness, not all males have it, but males

975
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:59.814
do have for the lack of the X chromosome.

976
00:48:59.824 --> 00:49:01.665
There are other kinds of color blindness but men

977
00:49:01.675 --> 00:49:03.695
are more likely to have this kind. So there's

978
00:49:03.705 --> 00:49:06.235
the most simple and obvious way that many men

979
00:49:06.245 --> 00:49:08.945
are less good at color because you have a

980
00:49:08.955 --> 00:49:11.574
hard time. If you have this distinguishing as my

981
00:49:11.584 --> 00:49:14.715
husband does between red and green, you know, he'll

982
00:49:14.725 --> 00:49:17.655
ask me to bring over the red blanket, which

983
00:49:17.665 --> 00:49:20.965
is very brown. It is a very, actually brown

984
00:49:20.975 --> 00:49:24.110
blanket. There is no mista it and I often

985
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.409
have to be like, do you mean the brown

986
00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:27.090
blanket? He's like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The blank. That

987
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.239
one, you know, because I'm cold, bring me the

988
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.899
thing that we both understand, why do you have

989
00:49:30.909 --> 00:49:33.850
to correct me. Um And likewise for green things

990
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.010
versus red things. So, um, in the ancestral condition,

991
00:49:38.149 --> 00:49:40.120
uh this may or may not have been a

992
00:49:40.129 --> 00:49:43.320
big problem. It's still so common that it clearly

993
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.919
wasn't so costly that anyone who had it would

994
00:49:45.929 --> 00:49:49.729
die. Let's put it that way. Um But when

995
00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:52.620
you eat certain kinds of fruit, when you are

996
00:49:52.629 --> 00:49:56.500
creatures that optimize for eating a tender green, you

997
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.330
know, reddish green sort of bud versus a more

998
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.939
mature leaf, which might be less nutritious for you

999
00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:05.209
or harder to digest. It can really be advantageous

1000
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:08.139
to have something like color vision if you are,

1001
00:50:08.149 --> 00:50:10.280
of course, creatures that are living in the daytime

1002
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.300
and not the night time, which was a big

1003
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.209
shift for a lot of primates. We began as

1004
00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:18.409
nocturnal creatures and then we shifted to day eaters

1005
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.889
and that, of course, totally changed our color vision.

1006
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.939
Yeah. So that's the thing now, whether or not

1007
00:50:24.949 --> 00:50:28.629
it's true that a typical si woman can look

1008
00:50:28.639 --> 00:50:32.000
out and understand fine differences between the colors of

1009
00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:37.209
a freaking shirt. Uh This feels cultural, this feels

1010
00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:40.080
maybe if you're not literally color blind, I think

1011
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.540
that's just how that brain evolved to pay attention

1012
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.820
to certain things, which is probably like a culturally

1013
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:47.959
situated, whatever, right? I don't know that it's actually

1014
00:50:47.969 --> 00:50:51.949
true that we are more aesthetically responsive as females

1015
00:50:51.959 --> 00:50:54.520
that seems like a weird, like gender story or

1016
00:50:54.614 --> 00:50:56.475
something. I think there are, there are many male

1017
00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:59.715
people who are perfectly excellent at being, for example,

1018
00:50:59.725 --> 00:51:03.334
fashion designers. Thank you very much. Um However, it

1019
00:51:03.344 --> 00:51:06.074
is true that there are a number of women

1020
00:51:06.084 --> 00:51:09.375
who are tetra chromat. There is this extra gene

1021
00:51:09.385 --> 00:51:12.794
that can produce extra um the ability to do.

1022
00:51:13.245 --> 00:51:15.870
Let me say that again, there are people who

1023
00:51:15.879 --> 00:51:19.919
because of having two X chromosomes may have extra

1024
00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:23.179
copies of things in their retinas that let them

1025
00:51:23.189 --> 00:51:25.780
see a more diverse array of color, something more

1026
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.949
akin. In fact to what birds do. They have

1027
00:51:28.959 --> 00:51:32.439
eyes or at least they have retinas like birds,

1028
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:35.340
but they don't know that they do. You have

1029
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.310
to do a genetic test for the damn thing.

1030
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.659
And then you have to see if they even

1031
00:51:38.669 --> 00:51:41.699
experience it because of course, when we grow up,

1032
00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:43.820
we live in a sensory world in which we

1033
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:47.209
live, which is optimized for trichromatism, which is what

1034
00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.625
you and I probably have, you know, picture a

1035
00:51:49.635 --> 00:51:53.284
stoplight, you, you, you you can see certain colors

1036
00:51:53.294 --> 00:51:55.084
and we live in a social environment in which

1037
00:51:55.094 --> 00:51:58.304
that sensory ability is rewarded, right? We don't need

1038
00:51:58.314 --> 00:52:01.175
to see things like birds. It's not useful to

1039
00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:03.925
see a weird shimmering rainbow coming off of every

1040
00:52:03.935 --> 00:52:06.044
single time you see a wave on the ocean,

1041
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.250
you know, um it it's not rewarded. So in

1042
00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.760
many cases, most of the genetically tetra chromat folk

1043
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.179
uh can't really say what they are seeing or

1044
00:52:18.189 --> 00:52:22.439
may not even consciously register that they're vaccinating millions

1045
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:26.040
more colors, distinguishable colors than we are. There's been,

1046
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.479
I think only a handful of people, maybe one

1047
00:52:28.489 --> 00:52:31.580
or two who are yes women who are tetra

1048
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:34.879
chromat who know that they are seeing this incredible

1049
00:52:34.889 --> 00:52:38.370
array of colors and can report it. So, really,

1050
00:52:38.419 --> 00:52:41.020
this weird number up to maybe a quarter of

1051
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.540
all women are like secret superheroes that just haven't

1052
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.520
trained their powers

1053
00:52:46.649 --> 00:52:50.090
but, but uh a about the smell bit. Uh

1054
00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:53.939
I mean, we're, we're being very feist here but,

1055
00:52:53.949 --> 00:52:55.760
but le let's try to be a little bit

1056
00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.850
more gender equal because what I'm about to ask

1057
00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.580
you is something that many times when women, for

1058
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:06.389
example, are pregnant, makes men who, who wake up

1059
00:53:06.399 --> 00:53:09.820
at 4 a.m. and go out to buy chocolate

1060
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.750
or whatever. So I, I

1061
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.655
remember just a partner being very nice. Ok? It's

1062
00:53:14.665 --> 00:53:16.475
not that we have to have a 4 a.m.

1063
00:53:16.485 --> 00:53:19.705
chocolate. It's just that um well, there's two levels

1064
00:53:19.715 --> 00:53:22.034
there now that isn't, well, that's part of olfaction

1065
00:53:22.044 --> 00:53:24.344
because to have a a craving for a food

1066
00:53:24.354 --> 00:53:27.084
is partially to desire, the taste and taste is

1067
00:53:27.094 --> 00:53:29.495
greatly a part of smell, but it's also very

1068
00:53:29.504 --> 00:53:32.334
much a brain based thing that somehow interacting with

1069
00:53:32.344 --> 00:53:35.584
your enteric nervous system, your guts uh that also

1070
00:53:35.594 --> 00:53:38.344
desire a food. So wanting a food is actually

1071
00:53:38.354 --> 00:53:41.439
kind of a whole body thing um which indeed

1072
00:53:41.449 --> 00:53:44.340
does go a little haywire when you're pregnant famously.

1073
00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:47.870
So, um, you also will experience more revulsion towards

1074
00:53:47.879 --> 00:53:50.610
certain tastes and smells that you didn't feel repulsed

1075
00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.949
by before at all. Um And that's what's interesting.

1076
00:53:53.959 --> 00:53:55.699
So two things are going on there or at

1077
00:53:55.709 --> 00:53:58.560
least that's the theory. There may be shifts in

1078
00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:02.500
raw olfaction, your ability to smell and taste, which

1079
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.739
may be heightened in other words, or changed in

1080
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:07.370
some deep way. You become better at smelling faint

1081
00:54:07.379 --> 00:54:10.120
things maybe when you're pregnant. So that's like a

1082
00:54:10.129 --> 00:54:13.110
nose based kind of thing. And then there's just

1083
00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.070
brain based stuff, which is your emotional response to

1084
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.699
this stuff, right? Because it's not simply when you

1085
00:54:18.709 --> 00:54:21.189
smell a thing, then you have an emotional response

1086
00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:23.120
to what you smell, not simply like in a

1087
00:54:23.129 --> 00:54:25.239
Proust Madeleine like, oh I have memories of my

1088
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.340
childhood and I like eating chocolate, you know, whatever,

1089
00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:30.760
right? You know, um it's more like a it's

1090
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.459
like uh we are always, our brains are always

1091
00:54:33.469 --> 00:54:35.969
already emotional. That's how we are as these social

1092
00:54:35.979 --> 00:54:38.100
primates, right? So there's literally never a moment. You're

1093
00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.050
not having some emotional response.

1094
00:54:40.229 --> 00:54:44.100
Wait a minute are men also emotional. That's another

1095
00:54:44.169 --> 00:54:44.199
one.

1096
00:54:44.209 --> 00:54:46.979
Very much. So you cannot have a brain and

1097
00:54:46.989 --> 00:54:50.830
not be emotional. OK? It's just Lisa Feldman Barrett

1098
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.530
has talked a lot about this. You know, there

1099
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.074
are many very excellent scientists who have been trying

1100
00:54:56.084 --> 00:54:58.784
to convince people that this thing we call emotion

1101
00:54:58.794 --> 00:55:01.415
is not so segregated you know, this is not

1102
00:55:01.445 --> 00:55:04.155
Antonio. Damasio also talks about this, you know, this

1103
00:55:04.274 --> 00:55:06.864
all of these categories of emotional response are very

1104
00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:10.155
much embedded in literally every thought that we have,

1105
00:55:10.225 --> 00:55:13.054
we just only register those very emotional things is

1106
00:55:13.064 --> 00:55:15.195
like, oh, well, that's emotion is like no, literally

1107
00:55:15.205 --> 00:55:18.415
everything you're doing with your brain involves emotion anyway,

1108
00:55:18.425 --> 00:55:22.310
moving on. So, ok, so emotional response then when

1109
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.209
you're pregnant may well be heightened to not only

1110
00:55:25.219 --> 00:55:28.229
olfactory signal but to many things. And that is

1111
00:55:28.239 --> 00:55:32.489
absolutely a response to the hormonal craziness that pregnancy

1112
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.389
involves. And so that's why disgusting things smell very

1113
00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:39.790
disgusting and things that normally don't smell disgusting may

1114
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.479
well for that person suddenly be disgusting. And that

1115
00:55:42.489 --> 00:55:44.479
other thing that they are normally not that into

1116
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.820
suddenly becomes the thing that you require at 4

1117
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.060
a.m. Some of that is your nose, some of

1118
00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:50.919
that is your nose, but not all of it.

1119
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.699
And, and is that in any way also a

1120
00:55:54.709 --> 00:56:00.780
mechanism to protect the fetus from potential uh bad

1121
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.830
foods, I mean infections or something like that,

1122
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.770
maybe, maybe. Um THAT'S one of the good theories

1123
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.360
going for it. Um And there are ways of

1124
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:12.110
testing it in ways not of testing it. And

1125
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.620
of course, we don't test it in pregnant human

1126
00:56:13.629 --> 00:56:16.260
beings. Um We do this more to pregnant rats

1127
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:18.560
and see, do they avoid the poison or not?

1128
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.860
You know. Um But when that, when pregnant, um

1129
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.679
the idea is that there are some tastes that

1130
00:56:24.689 --> 00:56:27.760
like bitter, bitter tastes are very commonly associated with

1131
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.270
many kinds of toxic things in the world. So

1132
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.030
we, uh tend to have a very negative response

1133
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.949
to things that taste bitter. We tend to have

1134
00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:38.560
more of a negative response when we're pregnant. And

1135
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:41.310
one assumes that that could have an evolved feature

1136
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:45.459
that this would be beneficial to avoid poisons. You

1137
00:56:45.469 --> 00:56:47.280
know, because the plant world turns out it's full

1138
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.260
of poison. Um YOU know, when you are a

1139
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.669
a pregnant body. So, um yes. So it may

1140
00:56:53.679 --> 00:56:56.669
well be that there is some avoidance that gets

1141
00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:59.030
heightened when you're pregnant and that your changes in

1142
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.780
your taste and your emotional response to taste and

1143
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:04.669
scent uh are sort of a built in evolved

1144
00:57:04.679 --> 00:57:08.110
and advantageous feature. You know, there may also be

1145
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.989
a nutrition seeking that happens because again, we've established

1146
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.659
that it's crazy not to lay eggs. So, you

1147
00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:17.830
know, you may well seek certain kinds of uh

1148
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.229
nutritive sources when you are pregnant that you wouldn't

1149
00:57:21.239 --> 00:57:25.629
normally be so desirous of. But let's not always

1150
00:57:25.639 --> 00:57:27.870
assume 1 to 1, not everything that happens in

1151
00:57:27.879 --> 00:57:31.010
pregnancy is an evolved thing that's advantageous. Some of

1152
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.949
it is very much accident. Some of it just

1153
00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:33.469
sucks.

1154
00:57:33.979 --> 00:57:36.110
But then you arrive at a point in our

1155
00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:40.770
revolutionary history where you have these new reproductive system,

1156
00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.290
you have pregnancy, you have birth, but then we

1157
00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:47.560
become bipedal. And I guess that to a certain

1158
00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.080
extent was not very pleasant,

1159
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.260
right? Some of it was great. Ok. Some of

1160
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:56.320
bipedalism is, which is walking on two legs. Uh

1161
00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:58.489
You know, because the assumption is before we were

1162
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.550
based largely in the trees and we did a

1163
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.489
little bit of walking around on two legs like

1164
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.649
tree based primates sometimes do. Uh, BUT it wasn't,

1165
00:58:05.659 --> 00:58:09.379
it wasn't our primary mode of locomotion. Yeah. Um,

1166
00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:12.139
WE were never knuckle walkers. That's uh a thing

1167
00:58:12.149 --> 00:58:14.810
that we've been correcting in the paleo record. And

1168
00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.510
you know, those little uh diagrams where you see

1169
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.350
the knuckle walker on the left and evolves up

1170
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.370
to a guy walking and then you see him

1171
00:58:21.379 --> 00:58:22.969
usually for a joke at the end sitting at

1172
00:58:22.979 --> 00:58:24.989
a computer typing and this is the evolution of

1173
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.120
man. Yeah. Well, um so it's actually the case

1174
00:58:29.129 --> 00:58:30.959
that no, we were more like these things with

1175
00:58:30.969 --> 00:58:33.020
our arms up up in the trees and then

1176
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:35.050
skip the knuckle walking all together because that's a

1177
00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:39.780
separate evolutionary path. OK. So anyway, walking upright, um

1178
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:43.429
means shifting the pelvis a bit in order to

1179
00:58:43.439 --> 00:58:47.550
have a better structure to anchor the buttocks. Actually,

1180
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.600
one of the big ways we walk actually is

1181
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:51.979
our butts. It's one, it is, in fact the

1182
00:58:51.989 --> 00:58:54.689
biggest single muscle, the gluteus maximus in the human

1183
00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:57.949
body. And it is incredibly important and it is

1184
00:58:57.959 --> 00:58:59.739
anchored in all kinds of ways. You actually have

1185
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:03.000
a number of butt muscles, gluteus, maximus, gluteus, medius,

1186
00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:06.300
gluteus, minimus exactly as it sounds anyway. So you

1187
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.129
have a number of butt muscles holding you up

1188
00:59:08.139 --> 00:59:10.429
there and then your spine forms a curve shape

1189
00:59:10.439 --> 00:59:13.310
to absorb, you know, impact because there's a lot

1190
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.810
of force now and what have you and suddenly

1191
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.060
you're an upright being. But of course, because we

1192
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.459
have long evolved to give birth through a birth

1193
00:59:20.469 --> 00:59:24.989
canal, which is situated down going between the hip

1194
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.399
bones, well, bringing the hip bones upright. Unfortunately, also

1195
00:59:29.409 --> 00:59:31.810
means closing the pelvic opening to make it a

1196
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.500
little bit smaller than it used to be. Yeah.

1197
00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:40.120
So um that has been ever since. Not great,

1198
00:59:40.129 --> 00:59:43.000
not great. I would say not wonderful at all

1199
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.399
because you see, we now have the condition of

1200
00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:49.110
very large babies and very small pelvic openings through

1201
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:53.139
which our birth canal passes. Ok. We have what's

1202
00:59:53.149 --> 00:59:57.020
called an obstetric dilemma. Um Now, it's been used

1203
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:59.199
to explain lots and lots of things. I think

1204
00:59:59.209 --> 01:00:01.949
the most compelling thing about the obstetric dilemma is

1205
01:00:01.959 --> 01:00:05.090
simply that it's dangerous. Um Not that it shaped

1206
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.120
everything in our path. Um The most dangerous feature

1207
01:00:08.129 --> 01:00:10.729
of our reproduction is our placenta actually, but still

1208
01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:13.729
getting them out of the body. Not great because

1209
01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:15.800
you're trying to take a watermelon size thing and

1210
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:18.439
squeeze it through a lemon sized hole. And if

1211
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:22.590
you've met fruit, you can understand that mechanistically, this

1212
01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.340
is a problem and we from uh pelvic analyses

1213
01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:29.800
and uh comparative uh morphologies and what have you

1214
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.489
we now have a general sense that starting at

1215
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.610
least by Lucy, uh the australopithecine 3.2 million years

1216
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.520
ago. Um We had this problem, we had a,

1217
01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.370
we had a too narrow opening in these bipedal

1218
01:00:43.379 --> 01:00:48.729
hominins and relatively large babies. And uh the assumption

1219
01:00:48.739 --> 01:00:51.149
then is that Lucy like us, probably had a

1220
01:00:51.159 --> 01:00:51.790
midwife.

1221
01:00:53.419 --> 01:00:55.560
Yeah, I, I mean, it would be very interesting

1222
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:59.280
to get into the midwife a bit, but unfortunately,

1223
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.800
taking into account our time limit. Uh AND because

1224
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:05.070
I mentioned at the beginning that I was going

1225
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.959
to ask you about this, let's move on to

1226
01:01:06.969 --> 01:01:11.830
another topic. What about menopause? I, I mean, why

1227
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.500
is it that at a certain point in the

1228
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.300
in the life of the life of females, they

1229
01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:21.500
reach a point where they are no longer able

1230
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:25.610
to reproduce, but they still live past them.

1231
01:01:26.219 --> 01:01:29.800
It is one of the great biological mysteries actually.

1232
01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.110
Now it is not a mystery why a person

1233
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.239
who no longer gives birth uh is valuable to

1234
01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:39.139
society and we often confuse those questions. Ok. Uh

1235
01:01:39.149 --> 01:01:41.800
The entire point of a woman's life uh is

1236
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.540
not simply to make babies. Thank you very much.

1237
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.489
But this is also true in the evolutionary sense,

1238
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.290
believe it or not. This is all so true

1239
01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:52.530
in the deep uh evolution of our body plans

1240
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:55.560
because what we fundamentally are, of course, is not

1241
01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:58.679
simply baby makers. What we fundamentally are again is

1242
01:01:58.689 --> 01:02:02.750
social primates and each member of our communities contributes

1243
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.459
equally to the success of our communities because we

1244
01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:11.729
are so interdependent, so communally bound. Yeah. So that

1245
01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:15.590
means of course, that our elderly should they survive

1246
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.030
to become elderly, are valuable to the community for

1247
01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.590
many reasons. But let me first say, getting back

1248
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.389
into the mechanisms of it. The reason it's a

1249
01:02:23.399 --> 01:02:26.939
mystery that menopause exists in part is because we

1250
01:02:26.949 --> 01:02:30.280
are one of the only species that has it.

1251
01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:34.429
OK. The only confirmed for sure, confirmed everyone in

1252
01:02:34.439 --> 01:02:39.580
the scientific community 100% agrees creatures that have menopause,

1253
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.679
which is to say we live a full third

1254
01:02:41.689 --> 01:02:45.679
of our lives after having stopped ovulating, after having

1255
01:02:45.689 --> 01:02:48.719
stopped, having had the ability to make babies are

1256
01:02:48.729 --> 01:02:52.979
human beings and a handful of toothed whales pretty

1257
01:02:52.989 --> 01:02:55.479
much that. Yep. Uh The ones we know most

1258
01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:58.750
about among the toothed whale are orca killer whales.

1259
01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.330
So basically, we have humans and we have killer

1260
01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.760
whales and that's what we're working with in terms

1261
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:06.600
of understanding menopause, which is not a great scientific

1262
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:08.889
situation to be in, in part because of course,

1263
01:03:08.959 --> 01:03:11.969
uh killer whales live in the damn ocean and

1264
01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:15.090
it is hard to study killer whales because boats

1265
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.389
and ocean anyway. So we finally did, however, figure

1266
01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:20.550
it out and we were able, we the scientific

1267
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.429
community, not me, I didn't do this research, but

1268
01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:25.120
the people who did are brilliant. So one of

1269
01:03:25.129 --> 01:03:27.620
the big theories for what you know, the evolutionary

1270
01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:30.909
conditions in which menopause was favored. In the rare

1271
01:03:30.919 --> 01:03:35.030
cases. It is, is that maybe menopausal females who

1272
01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.379
no longer have their own babies can then help

1273
01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:40.439
with the childcare for the third generation. They don't

1274
01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:43.199
have a competition for resources with their daughters to

1275
01:03:43.209 --> 01:03:46.639
provide for their offspring. Yeah. And they, uh, can

1276
01:03:46.649 --> 01:03:48.639
then, and they're free, they have more free time

1277
01:03:48.649 --> 01:03:50.750
as it were. It's kind of like the kindly

1278
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.459
grandmother is gonna help out with childcare while the

1279
01:03:53.469 --> 01:03:55.750
the, you know, the daughter, the mother of that

1280
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.340
grandchild can go do other things, right? So this

1281
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.475
was the idea for how menopause may be evolved.

1282
01:04:01.485 --> 01:04:04.915
It's called the grandmother hypothesis. OK. Cool. I loved

1283
01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:07.145
my grandmother too. She died before she was able

1284
01:04:07.155 --> 01:04:08.754
to help with childcare, but she, she was a

1285
01:04:08.764 --> 01:04:11.175
lovely woman. I remember her cookie jar. Um And

1286
01:04:11.185 --> 01:04:13.364
I would like that to be the story. However,

1287
01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.294
it does not seem to be the case that

1288
01:04:15.304 --> 01:04:17.854
at least among the only other known type of

1289
01:04:17.864 --> 01:04:20.764
creatures that have menopause that they help out with

1290
01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:25.375
the third generation more. Actually, in killer whales, they

1291
01:04:25.385 --> 01:04:30.489
don't help protect the grand babies more. They don't

1292
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.179
help get more food and do more food sharing

1293
01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:35.520
with that generation because they are, they have so

1294
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.370
much free time. No, actually the only thing they're

1295
01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:41.830
known for among these menopausal workers who are matriarchal.

1296
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.139
By the way, the grand menopausal grandmothers are very

1297
01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:47.280
much the grand dams in charge of the whole

1298
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:51.149
business for the whole pod in times of stress,

1299
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.110
they are good at leading the pod to good

1300
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.120
sources of food. Ok. So the local easy food

1301
01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:02.879
has run out. These menopausal grandmothers are good at

1302
01:05:02.889 --> 01:05:05.810
knowing where the hell the rarer sources that are

1303
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.739
reliable of food are located and they literally lead

1304
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:13.540
the dam pod there. They're also more involved in

1305
01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:17.989
teaching younger generations uh specialized hunting techniques like you

1306
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.739
know, that thing where you may have seen a

1307
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.659
video online where you see, uh orca, you know,

1308
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.550
killer whales lining up in a row and then

1309
01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.760
they bum rush an ice floe where a seal

1310
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.399
is sitting on top of the ice and the

1311
01:05:28.409 --> 01:05:31.389
bow wave of their movement knocks the seal off

1312
01:05:31.399 --> 01:05:33.340
the ice, which is a very good day for

1313
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.020
the killer whale is a very bad day for

1314
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:38.159
the seal, right? Yes. So that's a specialized hunting

1315
01:05:38.169 --> 01:05:41.040
technique that has to be taught. And the, uh,

1316
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:44.370
the matriarchs are very much involved in the teaching

1317
01:05:44.379 --> 01:05:47.699
of the young, which is to say what in

1318
01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:51.310
that situation, what the menopausal grandmothers are good for

1319
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.879
is simply still being alive and knowing stuff. Ok.

1320
01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:58.830
So let's think back to the human beings. What

1321
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.310
if all of humanity selected four traits that extended

1322
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.729
our lifespan? We know it did. We know for

1323
01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:09.080
a very long time, we died around 35. Ok.

1324
01:06:09.209 --> 01:06:11.250
But at some point, the assumption is it's many

1325
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.110
different traits in the body we evolved the ability

1326
01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.445
to live longer. We evolved the ability to live

1327
01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:20.225
into our freaking sixties, seventies God, eighties now, even

1328
01:06:20.235 --> 01:06:22.784
hundreds. That's a runaway train. But you know, we,

1329
01:06:22.794 --> 01:06:27.774
we have evolved longevity, human type, longevity. Ok, which

1330
01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:31.564
would be beneficial to everyone. Should you manage to

1331
01:06:31.574 --> 01:06:34.945
make it precisely because then you have generations that

1332
01:06:34.955 --> 01:06:39.225
remember how to survive difficult conditions that are rare,

1333
01:06:39.719 --> 01:06:44.050
right? So both grandmothers and grandfathers then would be

1334
01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.409
good at remembering how to survive the flood that

1335
01:06:47.419 --> 01:06:51.709
had happened 30 years ago because they were alive

1336
01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:53.379
at the moment that a lot of other people

1337
01:06:53.389 --> 01:06:57.290
were literally not yet born. Ok. In a social

1338
01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.570
environment before you have anything like God, the written

1339
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.729
word. Are you kidding? No, when all you have

1340
01:07:02.739 --> 01:07:04.510
is the ability to talk to one another. When

1341
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.389
all you have is the ability to, you know,

1342
01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:08.679
maybe a little bit better than monkey. See, monkey

1343
01:07:08.689 --> 01:07:11.620
do the elderly members of the group are very

1344
01:07:11.629 --> 01:07:16.179
good at helping an interdependent group survive a dangerous

1345
01:07:16.189 --> 01:07:19.600
world. And so the reason we have menopause in

1346
01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:23.080
that case is more that the ovaries never got

1347
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:26.149
the message. They're still running the old monkey plan.

1348
01:07:26.159 --> 01:07:28.449
And it turns out this is true. Our ovaries

1349
01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:32.209
are finessing at a very typical rate for a

1350
01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:34.919
primate. You know, there have been studies now that

1351
01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:38.135
look across species that indeed our ovaries are aging

1352
01:07:38.145 --> 01:07:40.685
at a sort of normal primate rate given an

1353
01:07:40.695 --> 01:07:44.225
expected lifespan. And it's just that they never got

1354
01:07:44.235 --> 01:07:46.405
the message that they were supposed to live longer.

1355
01:07:46.415 --> 01:07:48.945
Personally. I'm very glad for this because I don't

1356
01:07:48.955 --> 01:07:50.725
want to give birth in my seventies. I'm good.

1357
01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:53.074
I'm good. I'm happy in fact, to be done

1358
01:07:53.165 --> 01:07:54.935
with the two times I have given birth and

1359
01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:57.344
to literally never do that again, would be ideal.

1360
01:07:57.465 --> 01:07:59.760
Um BECAUSE the way we do it is again

1361
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:02.810
terrible, but it does mean that we have a

1362
01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.820
lot of knock on effects. Unfortunately, a lot of

1363
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.139
post menopausal conditions like osteoporosis and other things in

1364
01:08:08.149 --> 01:08:10.899
which there is a kind of mismatch between the

1365
01:08:10.909 --> 01:08:13.439
older body and the rest of our body systems

1366
01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:16.379
and the ovary, which had long been involved in

1367
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:20.850
this complex hormonal signaling system that, you know, keeps

1368
01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:23.979
everything in check, right, the endocrine system, in other

1369
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:27.029
words, that then changes and starts to screw things

1370
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:27.500
up a bit.

1371
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:32.029
So, uh ii, I mean, uh th this might

1372
01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.959
be a sort of very short uh psychoanalytic ses

1373
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.390
session. But uh I mean, since we're talking about

1374
01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:44.089
older women, I I'm very worried about uh this

1375
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.075
bit here. So because uh that there are some

1376
01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:50.145
older women that I find very attractive, but then

1377
01:08:50.154 --> 01:08:54.404
I tune into Mano Sphere podcasts and uh I

1378
01:08:54.415 --> 01:08:58.035
don't know, red Pill community forums and they basically

1379
01:08:58.044 --> 01:09:01.765
say that women have an expiration date. So, am

1380
01:09:01.774 --> 01:09:03.964
I a freak or what?

1381
01:09:05.259 --> 01:09:09.009
Well, um I mean, the short answer is yes

1382
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.459
and no uh you may be, you may be

1383
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.689
a freak in that you give a damn about

1384
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.569
women suffering that uh unfortunately may be more of

1385
01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.870
the signal given how much of the world seems

1386
01:09:20.879 --> 01:09:22.979
to. Not. So it's a, it's a good thing.

1387
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.830
It's a good thing in terms of whether you,

1388
01:09:24.839 --> 01:09:28.180
you're freaking kink space. Oh, actually, attraction to older

1389
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:30.680
bodies seems very common. You need only look at

1390
01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:33.700
the internet and porn for granny, porn, my God.

1391
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.580
Um It's everywhere. So no, that seems a very

1392
01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:39.240
common uh thing that many people are into and

1393
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:41.180
you need not get into the details about how

1394
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:46.100
into it you are. OK. Now, II I wouldn't

1395
01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:48.589
dream of asking. No. So I would say at

1396
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.540
least in the manoe. Um AND the idea of

1397
01:09:51.549 --> 01:09:54.930
women having an expiration date, well, you know, I'll

1398
01:09:54.939 --> 01:09:57.330
even have a little bit of sympathy here whenever

1399
01:09:57.339 --> 01:10:01.209
somebody needs to make the claim that somebody else

1400
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.229
has an expiration date. It's usually because they have

1401
01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:08.629
anxiety about their own. Ok? So usually a lot

1402
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.310
of this bigotry, a lot of this misogyny, a

1403
01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:14.910
lot of this crap is inevitably coming from um

1404
01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.229
somebody who doesn't know what to do with their

1405
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.470
own vulnerability, you know that something about their lives

1406
01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:23.339
really sucks and they don't know how to feel

1407
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:25.750
about it. And they live indeed in this case,

1408
01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:27.700
in a sexist world that is also hard on

1409
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:30.310
men in different ways and, and the way that

1410
01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:33.299
they are coping is by being assholes. So, you

1411
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.839
know, we're, we're not perfect beings. Ok. Many of

1412
01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:38.060
us cope by turning into assholes. It's just some

1413
01:10:38.069 --> 01:10:41.660
are worse than others about it. Scientifically though, I

1414
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:44.080
think you also mean to ask me, however you

1415
01:10:44.089 --> 01:10:46.229
may not know. Although having read my book, maybe

1416
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.419
you do that among other primates, actually, aged females

1417
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.759
are often the most attractive members of a group.

1418
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.790
So chimpanzees at the very least famously, so are

1419
01:10:57.799 --> 01:11:01.669
extremely attracted to the eldest females in their group.

1420
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.819
That chick is the sexiest thing to a chimp

1421
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:07.390
male and she will have her teeth falling out,

1422
01:11:07.399 --> 01:11:09.910
she will have patches falling out of her hair.

1423
01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:11.990
I mean, you know, there's granny porn and then

1424
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.370
there's what chimps are into. My God, they are

1425
01:11:14.379 --> 01:11:18.535
into very elderly females. Now, in part, it may

1426
01:11:18.544 --> 01:11:21.464
be because many chimpanzees indeed do give birth when

1427
01:11:21.475 --> 01:11:24.544
they're elderly. And so simply having signals that you

1428
01:11:24.555 --> 01:11:28.115
have survived that long and having well established social

1429
01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:30.254
hierarchies in this group where you may be an

1430
01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:32.884
alpha female at this point is a very sexy

1431
01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:35.895
thing to a chimp male, you know, so, um

1432
01:11:36.185 --> 01:11:38.495
you know, maybe your desires are a continuation of

1433
01:11:38.504 --> 01:11:41.560
older patterns, I couldn't say. Uh BUT I think

1434
01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:43.870
actually when it comes to when it comes to

1435
01:11:43.879 --> 01:11:48.910
human sexuality, though, assume diversity is the norm, we're

1436
01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:52.299
just really horny. We are horny creatures and we

1437
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:56.439
are often promiscuous creatures. And so that anyone would

1438
01:11:56.450 --> 01:12:00.330
have something they're into isn't surprising. It just shouldn't

1439
01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:03.080
be surprising. That's just how we are with sort

1440
01:12:03.089 --> 01:12:03.750
of everything.

1441
01:12:04.379 --> 01:12:06.740
But I guess that makes a very good segue

1442
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.359
to my last question and I hope this is

1443
01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:11.689
a quick one because I'm really getting mindful of

1444
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.479
your time here. But do we have any idea

1445
01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:18.770
where sexism comes from? I mean, because it's one

1446
01:12:18.779 --> 01:12:22.129
thing for it to exist, but where does it

1447
01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.060
stem from?

1448
01:12:23.069 --> 01:12:27.069
Exactly. Let me make sure I know what you

1449
01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.229
most want out of this question. Do you mean

1450
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.600
when did sex evolve? Males and females like way

1451
01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:36.029
the hell back, like, I mean, before fish or

1452
01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.970
do you mean, uh, sex in the human body

1453
01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:39.919
or what, what

1454
01:12:40.029 --> 01:12:43.524
I means to aspects to the question? First of

1455
01:12:43.535 --> 01:12:48.194
all, since we're talking here about evolutionary biology, if

1456
01:12:48.205 --> 01:12:53.314
you think there are any evolutionary basis for sexism,

1457
01:12:53.325 --> 01:12:57.794
that's the first one and the second sexism, sexism

1458
01:12:57.845 --> 01:13:02.479
and, and the second one, I mean, culturally speaking,

1459
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:07.089
when did things like the patriarchy started? And all

1460
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.279
of that?

1461
01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.850
You mean the final chapter of my book? Yes.

1462
01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:12.240
Let's see if I can do that chapter quickly.

1463
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:15.959
Um Let's see. Well, I can tell you a

1464
01:13:16.419 --> 01:13:20.299
few important, important features of that chapter. The first

1465
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.439
is that I have always found it very suspicious

1466
01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:31.379
when we see women reinforcing sexist rules, um, which

1467
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:34.259
is very, very common, very, very common. It's not

1468
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:37.779
rare even remotely, it is extremely common that and

1469
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:42.419
sometimes the most vocal, you know, advocates of uh

1470
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:46.359
gender norms and sexism in general, you know, things

1471
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:49.490
that would seem to not benefit them or any

1472
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.299
other female that they're advocating for um, is somehow

1473
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:57.279
what's called internalized sexism, which somehow, in other words

1474
01:13:57.290 --> 01:14:00.629
that they have taken sexist ideals, which must evolve

1475
01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.100
from the patriarchy and from men, that men would

1476
01:14:03.109 --> 01:14:05.379
be the origins of sexism and then they've taken

1477
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:08.049
it into themselves and they're just poor, pathetic little

1478
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.649
puppets. Yeah. Mouthing the uh the ideas of others.

1479
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:16.395
And you see similar ideas are equally um patronizing

1480
01:14:16.544 --> 01:14:20.325
about poor people, advocating for conservatism when it doesn't

1481
01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:23.944
benefit them. You know, economically in various countries. We,

1482
01:14:23.955 --> 01:14:27.225
in other words, we, we like to denigrate people

1483
01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:30.444
who seem to be making political and social choices

1484
01:14:30.455 --> 01:14:34.600
that don't obviously benefit themselves. So it's useful to

1485
01:14:34.609 --> 01:14:36.759
not be so patronizing. There's always that as a

1486
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:41.089
first principle. Um But in biology, it's also useful

1487
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.419
and this is something I do in the book

1488
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:46.540
to say. Well, no, we actually know that huge

1489
01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:50.819
numbers of women are advocates for very restrictive sex

1490
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:52.779
rules. And what I mean in here it's like

1491
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:55.509
a subset of sexism, which is what females can

1492
01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.009
wear, where they can go in a day, what

1493
01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:00.500
sort of jobs they can have, what who they

1494
01:15:00.509 --> 01:15:03.299
can interact with and definitely anything around anyone they

1495
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:05.410
might have sex with. And then then on into

1496
01:15:05.419 --> 01:15:07.149
the baby making and the norms for all of

1497
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.819
that. Right? You know that they're very vocal advocates

1498
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:13.220
for this kind of stuff. It seems to me

1499
01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:15.870
a bit foolish to think that this is simply

1500
01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:19.229
internalized sexism that no, there must be something driving

1501
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.779
this because we are, of course, any good behaviorist

1502
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:26.169
will tell you in biology that we are social

1503
01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:29.229
beings, we are all equal participants in our social

1504
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.240
rules. We generate them, we reinforce them, we we

1505
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.950
push against them. We're all doing this together. None

1506
01:15:34.959 --> 01:15:37.490
of us is in control of the rules, right?

1507
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
We're all building them and making them and reinforcing

1508
01:15:39.509 --> 01:15:42.790
them all the time throughout our lives. Women too.

1509
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:46.250
And I, so I thought, well, OK, I've just

1510
01:15:46.259 --> 01:15:48.390
spent a decade of my life thinking about deep,

1511
01:15:48.399 --> 01:15:51.220
deep time and body plans and evolution. And what

1512
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:53.930
would an evolutionary biologist say about all of this?

1513
01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.720
Um Well, a lot of these sex rules are

1514
01:15:57.729 --> 01:16:03.140
directly tied to the levers of reproduction. Ok. So

1515
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:07.299
they have to do with access to female bodies,

1516
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:10.080
how much of that body can be seen in

1517
01:16:10.089 --> 01:16:12.859
what context and by whom, how much of that

1518
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:15.479
body can be approached in what context and by

1519
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:17.700
whom? And God, by the time you get to

1520
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:21.069
anything directly involving sex, there are many, many, many

1521
01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.459
rules, right? And of course around baby making too,

1522
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:27.529
which is to say all of these, this constellation

1523
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.240
of sex rules together are manipulating culture by culture,

1524
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:36.100
the fertility of the females in that culture, when

1525
01:16:36.109 --> 01:16:39.040
she has babies and under what conditions and with

1526
01:16:39.049 --> 01:16:42.950
whom right now, if you think back to an

1527
01:16:42.959 --> 01:16:48.359
ancestral state where again, female birth is incredibly dangerous

1528
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:52.149
uh female, right? You know that sorry by female

1529
01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.200
birth, I simply mean giving birth is dangerous being

1530
01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.490
pregnant, giving birth and the postpartum recovery period and

1531
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.549
then lactation and everything. This is a vulnerable, dangerous

1532
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.649
period that is hard to do. Ok. So controlling

1533
01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.169
when and how you get pregnant. Culture by culture,

1534
01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.250
the rules are different but every single one has

1535
01:17:08.259 --> 01:17:11.689
rules, access to female bodies, every culture is different,

1536
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.750
but we all have strong rules and we feel

1537
01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:17.649
strongly about them. This is manipulating fertility patterns. That's

1538
01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:21.160
the biological perspective. And in deep time culture by

1539
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:24.529
culture, in various environments that may well have been

1540
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:28.399
biologically beneficial. It may have helped more females survive

1541
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:31.160
and thrive in their babies too, right? Because in

1542
01:17:31.169 --> 01:17:33.279
some environments, it might be good to have cultural

1543
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:36.180
rules that effectively cluster your births that at the

1544
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:38.060
start of your reproductive life, you have a bunch

1545
01:17:38.069 --> 01:17:40.939
of babies and then you just raise those babies

1546
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:42.890
and that's how you do it. Now. That's going

1547
01:17:42.899 --> 01:17:45.700
to be differently. Rewarding depending how much food is

1548
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:48.200
available. If it's seasonal, et cetera, et ce, right?

1549
01:17:48.439 --> 01:17:50.529
In other environments, it might be better to space

1550
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.089
out. Your birds might be better to start later

1551
01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:56.189
and have a later cluster right after you have

1552
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.120
arrived at a certain point in a social milieu

1553
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.830
arrived at a certain point with a certain social

1554
01:18:01.839 --> 01:18:04.259
status, right, that the birds come later after you've

1555
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:06.629
achieved it. Anyway, the point is is that every

1556
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.629
human culture seems to have something like a drive.

1557
01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.660
I know scientifically, the word drive is complicated, but

1558
01:18:13.169 --> 01:18:16.040
we seem driven nonetheless, not only to create culture

1559
01:18:16.049 --> 01:18:19.479
but to create sex rules within our many cultures

1560
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:22.549
and then strongly reinforce them and when we change

1561
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.279
them, then strongly reinforce the change. And we always

1562
01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:28.290
feel very passionately about it. And it seemed to

1563
01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:31.560
me that that's simply something that human beings may

1564
01:18:31.569 --> 01:18:34.149
well do precisely because we're so bad at giving

1565
01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.049
birth. But the thing is is that we also

1566
01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.299
evolved this beautiful thing called human type gynecology. We

1567
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:42.859
have an incredible tool set that comes from the

1568
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:45.810
dawn of midwifery back in the australopithecines and all

1569
01:18:45.819 --> 01:18:47.729
the way forward. We're much better at it now

1570
01:18:48.029 --> 01:18:50.850
that also intervenes on human fertility. And it is

1571
01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.620
actually a hell of a lot better at keeping

1572
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:55.810
women and girls alive and thriving and surviving through

1573
01:18:55.819 --> 01:18:58.669
the messy process of having a female body. So

1574
01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.250
maybe just now we arrive at a moment in

1575
01:19:01.259 --> 01:19:03.419
human evolution where we can get our heads above

1576
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:05.810
water and um choose.

1577
01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.259
And I mean, if people want to learn more

1578
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:13.859
about that and other aspects of our sociality, they

1579
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:16.330
can of course read your book if how the

1580
01:19:16.339 --> 01:19:19.700
female body drove 200 million years of human evolution.
