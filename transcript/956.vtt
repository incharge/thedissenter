00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.099
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.860
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Wat. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:09.310
joined for a third time by Dr Edward Watts.

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.399
He is the Vasilia, this Professor of Greek Byzantine

5
00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.789
Greek History at the University of California, San Diego.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.770
In our two previous conversations, we talked about two

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.860
of his books, namely Mortal Republic and The Eternal

8
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.799
Decline and Fall Of Rome. And today we're talking

9
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.479
about another one of his books, IPA, The Life

10
00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.509
and Legend of an ancient philosopher. So, Doctor Watts,

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.729
welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.330
to everyone.

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.169
Thank you. I'm really glad to be back.

14
00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:45.979
So perhaps to contextualize things a little bit here

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.759
for people who might not be familiar with Hype

16
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.729
and where she lived in, where she came from.

17
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:55.340
So could you tell us a little bit about

18
00:00:55.349 --> 00:01:01.139
the social, political and historical context where Hype lived

19
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.020
back in Alexandria?

20
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.690
Sure. Um So our patient is born around 355

21
00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.330
ad. And uh this is a moment in the

22
00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:12.849
Roman Empire where there's a really significant transition going

23
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.669
on. The Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity in 3313,

24
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.629
3, 12, 313 ad and initiated this process through

25
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.569
which the Roman Empire was shifting towards a Christian

26
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.010
majority state. So when Constantine converted, the empire was

27
00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:34.099
about 10% Christian. Um Constantine died in 337. It

28
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.169
seems like the um empire tipped to be more

29
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.580
than 50% Christian, maybe around the year 400. So

30
00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:46.250
during hype's lifetime, you have this process unfolding in,

31
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.410
in Rome or in the larger empire where you're

32
00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:54.449
going from a very large majority pagan empire to

33
00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.209
a majority Christian empire. And this happens during her

34
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.720
lifetime. But what's interesting in 355 is Ipe is

35
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.720
born in the city of Alexandria in Egypt. And

36
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.599
Alexandria has probably the largest Christian community in, you

37
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.220
know, maybe the world um for any city at

38
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.550
that moment when she's born, it hadn't yet become

39
00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.440
a majority Christian city. And so the pagans in

40
00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.100
that city are imagining that, you know, Christianity is

41
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.250
a sort of nuisance and it's, it's like large

42
00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.970
and they're loud, but they don't really matter. And

43
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.289
uh it becomes very clear that Alexandria has probably

44
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.089
tipped to a Christian majority city when hype is

45
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.320
a child. Uh And so she belongs to um

46
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.839
a, a generation that actually is the first um

47
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.869
urban generation to deal with living in a Christian

48
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.479
majority city. Uh And so that's a really crucial,

49
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.440
it's a really crucial element of her background, right?

50
00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.009
Because nobody knows how to do this. I mean,

51
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.229
Christians don't know how to live as a majority

52
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.800
in a major city. And pagans don't know what

53
00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.199
to do with a, you know, with a major

54
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.729
city in which they're no longer in the majority.

55
00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.979
And this is where she's growing up. She's growing

56
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.710
up as a pagan in this city that like

57
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.080
during her childhood, flipped from majority pagan to majority

58
00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.570
Christian

59
00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.509
and she remained the pagan through all to her

60
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.139
life, or did she change her religion?

61
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.199
So hype remains a pagan for her entire life.

62
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.279
Um And I think what's important for us and

63
00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.259
challenging for us to understand is that paganism in

64
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.539
the fourth century isn't a religion of identity, like

65
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.229
we think of religions now, right? Nobody walked around

66
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.490
and said, I'm a pagan because paganism is in

67
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.860
essence a default religion. Um It's a default religious

68
00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.820
category. So everybody who is not a Christian or

69
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.910
a Jew is a pagan. And so there's lots

70
00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.500
and lots and lots of different beliefs and practices

71
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.059
that constitute paganism in the fourth century. So for

72
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.899
hypatia paganism is about practice. You know, it's about

73
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.880
what do you do and it's about um what

74
00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.759
ways do you live your life so that you're

75
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.130
being consistent with what you think the gods want

76
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.830
and what you believe is going to lead to,

77
00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.330
you know, a better outcome spiritually for you and

78
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.699
the people around you. And so I patient very

79
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.660
much is committed to this idea. Um But paganism

80
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.339
for her is a belief system and a set

81
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.540
of practices that ultimately um helps construct the world

82
00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:27.640
in a better way. Uh And so she's very

83
00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.880
firmly committed to this. Um And, you know, and

84
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.959
she's very firmly committed to this as a set

85
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.209
of ideas and actions, but it's not for her

86
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.470
an identity, it's really instead something that's part of

87
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.410
a larger embrace of a, of a fashion of,

88
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.589
um living in the world around her. And so

89
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.989
there's no way that she would ever imagine that

90
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.130
this is something that she should turn away from.

91
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.459
But then you mentioned there that the city became

92
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.489
a Christian majority city. And uh I would like

93
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.170
to understand uh I mean, if you, if you

94
00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:07.000
know about that specifically in what ways did the

95
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.579
social dynamics change when it became a Christian majority

96
00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:19.445
city? And was, were the pagans treated differently by

97
00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:23.364
the Christians when they became the majority or not?

98
00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:26.045
I mean, basically, I'm trying to understand if her

99
00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:29.684
being a pagan or remaining a pagan really had

100
00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:34.565
much influence in her than living in a Christian

101
00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:38.975
majority city in terms of how she was treated

102
00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:39.644
and so on.

103
00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:42.149
Yeah. So I think one of the things that

104
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.570
um is a challenge for everybody in the fourth

105
00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:46.070
century is what does it mean to live in

106
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.959
a city where there's a Christian majority? So Alexander

107
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.649
is a very dense city, you know, it's, it

108
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.989
has probably 500,000 people. It's a very small space,

109
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.589
it's more or less an island. Um, AND so

110
00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.820
it is a very difficult place for people to,

111
00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:04.910
um, get along without violence erupting. And Alexander had

112
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.790
a history of violence. Um, AND what tended to

113
00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:11.109
happen in these violent confrontations is groups who basically

114
00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.079
jostle for dominance in the city. So if you're

115
00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:16.640
the biggest group, you expect that when things reserve

116
00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:19.079
to violence you're gonna win and you're going to

117
00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.000
be able to exert your um vision of what

118
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.600
the city should be like in a fashion that

119
00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:27.149
the other side might not like. And what ends

120
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.239
up happening in the middle part of the three

121
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.470
fifties is there is a violent confrontation that pagans

122
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.809
expect they're going to win and they lose and

123
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.399
it becomes clear to them and this is how

124
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.130
we, we can see that it's probably Christian majority.

125
00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:42.049
Um, YOU know, they thought they had a majority

126
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.070
of people and they didn't. Uh And so what

127
00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.510
unfolds across the rest of the fourth century and

128
00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:51.100
into the fifth century are these periodic outbursts of

129
00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:55.230
violence where now pagans are fighting as the minority

130
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.910
and Christians are fighting from a position of majority

131
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.269
and the Christian majority is growing um much more

132
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.190
significantly. Um, OVER time. And so by the time

133
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.519
violent outbreaks are happening in the three eighties, there's

134
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.910
no doubt in anybody's mind that, uh you know,

135
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.859
there's a Christian majority and by the time of

136
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.380
apes death in 415, it's a very large Christian

137
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.950
majority. Um And so the so I think the

138
00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.679
dynamic in Alexandria that we have to understand is

139
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.700
it's a communal, it's a city in which communal

140
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:32.679
differences are resolved violently when they can't be resolved

141
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.359
peacefully anymore. And frequently the leaders of those communities

142
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:40.890
try to diffuse situations so that they don't become

143
00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.119
violent, but they also are fully aware that they

144
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.679
can become violent and they are prepared when they

145
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.720
become violent to be able to win when the

146
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.619
violence erupts. Uh And so this is a climate

147
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.619
in which Hypatia is growing up. Um The rules

148
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.690
in Alexandria have been very clear for a very

149
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.309
long time that uh if you cannot resolve things

150
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.619
peacefully, it's within the realm of possibility that you

151
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.549
will resolve things violently. Um And everybody knows this,

152
00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:10.850
but everybody also has an incentive to try to

153
00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.329
keep things peaceful for as long as they can

154
00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:15.269
and to prevent things from getting to the point

155
00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:17.829
where violence is going to be necessary. And so

156
00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:20.130
this is the kind of dynamic in which she's

157
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.089
growing up. Um It's a city that has demographic

158
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.609
instability because you have now um rules that have

159
00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:32.570
long been established about settling confrontations violently if you

160
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.239
can't negotiate your way out of them. But nobody

161
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.549
quite knows how large each side is if the

162
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:40.049
violence is going to come about.

163
00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:44.450
So before we get a little bit more into

164
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.090
her life? Uh What about the intellectual life of

165
00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:53.599
Alexandria back then? What characterized it since we're talking

166
00:08:53.609 --> 00:08:58.080
here about uh woman uh intellectual. So,

167
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:02.700
yeah, so uh Alexandria in uh the fourth century

168
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.760
ad has, you know, for almost 700 years been

169
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.289
the leading center of um Greek scientific and mathematical

170
00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.849
thought and, you know, and medical thought. Um There

171
00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:18.390
is a long standing rivalry between Alexandria and Athens.

172
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.429
Athens, of course, is, is older. Uh And so

173
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.869
Athens has this claim as the center where philosophy

174
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.150
was developed and to a degree where like rhetoric

175
00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:30.020
was developed. But in Alexandria, they really have a

176
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.474
very strong claim to um having invented the most

177
00:09:34.484 --> 00:09:38.405
sophisticated mathematics in the ancient world um to have

178
00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:43.364
invented the most sophisticated scientific um techniques and you

179
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:47.875
know, to have really advanced um mechanical engineering and

180
00:09:47.885 --> 00:09:52.664
medical um research being done. So there's a rivalry

181
00:09:52.674 --> 00:09:55.515
between Athens and Alexandria that you might wanna think

182
00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:58.025
in, in like an American context would be like

183
00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:02.835
the rivalry between, I don't know, mit and um

184
00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:06.359
a school that, you know, is really, really good

185
00:10:06.369 --> 00:10:11.900
in teaching philosophy and the humanities. Um Alexandria is

186
00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:16.479
the stem school and Athens is the humanities school.

187
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.030
And so by the time you get into the

188
00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:20.419
fourth century, this is the long standing way to

189
00:10:20.429 --> 00:10:24.150
see things, but it isn't exclusive. Alexandria has a

190
00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:29.650
strong tradition of teaching philosophy in a way that

191
00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:34.659
um embeds mathematics in it. So the Alexandrian idea

192
00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:38.820
for a long time had been. Well, yes, philosophy

193
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.159
is very important. Um BUT philosophy is imprecise, you

194
00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:45.390
know, you talk about something like Plato's idea of,

195
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.219
of justice. And Plato says, well, there's a basic

196
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:51.219
idea of justice that you can encapsulate in this

197
00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:54.500
concept that is a form. Well, Alexander and say,

198
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.700
you know, like what is that? That's totally abstract.

199
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.710
Who knows what a form is? Nobody's ever seen

200
00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:03.090
one we can say though that justice can be

201
00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:06.090
understood as a number. And if you understand it

202
00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:09.289
as a number, then you can explore the elements

203
00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:13.809
of that numbers use um and its characteristics and

204
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.250
how it works in a mathematical system. And that

205
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.169
allows us better to understand how concepts fit together

206
00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.489
with each other in a larger world. And so

207
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.559
the Alexandrian idea um was for a very long

208
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.380
time to say, in essence, you wanna know about

209
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.559
virtue, learn math. Um You wanna learn about, you

210
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.020
wanna learn about how to live your life, learn

211
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.250
math, because math is more precise, the relationships are

212
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.880
clearer and they're more defined and you can actually

213
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.309
understand how these concepts work together when you use

214
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.469
them through a sort of mathematical symbolism. Um And

215
00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:50.719
so what Alexandria has done leading up to um

216
00:11:50.729 --> 00:11:53.440
the moment of hype's birth is it's created a

217
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.640
very distinctive brand of um intellectual life that combines

218
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.559
this very long standing tradition of uh mathematical and

219
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.429
engineering and technical learning with a, a sort of

220
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.869
structure that allows you to apply it to more

221
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.900
humanistic um pursuits as well. So this is the

222
00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:15.580
kind of world that hype is born into. Uh

223
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.250
AND she's actually born to the guy who is

224
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.270
the leader of this, this intellectual movement um in

225
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.179
the three fifties.

226
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.059
So now that we so to speak, set up

227
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:34.359
the stage who was IPA. And exactly what do

228
00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:38.559
we know about her origins, how she grew up,

229
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.880
the kind of education she received and so on.

230
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.640
So I am one of the world's biggest like

231
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.080
Hypatia fans. I love Hypatia. Um And I think

232
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.799
what, what we have to understand with hype is

233
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.140
there's really sort of two versions of her, there's

234
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.809
the version that everybody knows about that's in, you

235
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.539
know, that's most famously celebrated in um the movie

236
00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:02.919
Gara, you know, she's a martyr, she's somebody who

237
00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:06.940
dies for her principles and dies for her philosophical

238
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.640
um practices. And that's true. She does. But I

239
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.309
think when we, when we allow somebody to become

240
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.770
a caricature and we allow them to just be

241
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.669
distilled down into this like one moment where we

242
00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:22.929
define their entire life, we miss who the person

243
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.840
is. And I actually think the person is way

244
00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:28.130
more interesting than the martyr. Um BECAUSE what Hacia

245
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.479
represents uh is, you know, a symbol of rationalism

246
00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:35.210
in a moment of extremism. But what hype actually

247
00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:38.890
was is a woman who was brilliant and had

248
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.760
a vision for how she wanted to change this

249
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.510
Alexandrian philosophical environment and this Alexandrian intellectual environment, um

250
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.409
she understood full uh and completely that as a

251
00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:51.270
woman, this would be a difficult thing to do.

252
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:56.669
And yet she very actively, very openly and very,

253
00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:01.210
very compellingly presented a vision of philosophy that upset

254
00:14:01.219 --> 00:14:04.539
the entire way that Alexandria thought about philosophy. And

255
00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:07.380
then she applied this to trying to regulate the

256
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.140
public life in this city that of course, is

257
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.830
prone to violence. Um And so what she was

258
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.070
trying to do is to take her philosophical understanding,

259
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.195
make her city better. Um And do it in

260
00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:22.664
a way that was consistent with the philosophical ideals

261
00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:24.955
that she embodied and she brought to, brought to

262
00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.215
bear in the way that she lived in the

263
00:14:26.224 --> 00:14:28.994
world. And so I think for the six years

264
00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:31.364
that she's alive, what you see is somebody who

265
00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.994
understood full well, the risks that she was taking,

266
00:14:34.044 --> 00:14:38.294
she understood completely the kinds of um challenges she

267
00:14:38.304 --> 00:14:40.255
would face as a woman trying to do this

268
00:14:40.265 --> 00:14:43.174
work and she did it very eagerly because she

269
00:14:43.184 --> 00:14:45.039
thought it was the right thing to do. Um

270
00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:47.880
And you know, and she did it understanding completely

271
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.080
that there would be personal sacrifices that she would

272
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.299
have to make to have the impact on the

273
00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:54.729
world that she wanted to. She did it anyway.

274
00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:57.010
And so I think that that's, that's a different

275
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.809
type of heroism than being a martyr for a

276
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.090
cause um what, what that represents is somebody who

277
00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:08.010
is really driven by a set of ideals um

278
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.789
and understands completely that there will be personal consequences

279
00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:14.650
but assumes those consequences anyway.

280
00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:19.669
Mhm Yes. We'll come back to this uh to

281
00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.780
people thinking about type patient as a symbol or

282
00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:26.270
a my even, let's say then uh really as

283
00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.390
a person, but then how much do we know

284
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.630
about her life? Exactly.

285
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.719
So, um the sources that we have for a

286
00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:39.799
patient's life are much less robust than we would

287
00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:44.630
like. Um WE have a set of biographies or

288
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.669
a set of biographical treatments of her written by

289
00:15:47.979 --> 00:15:51.710
a male pagan philosopher in the sixth century ad.

290
00:15:51.979 --> 00:15:55.260
Um And he's writing at a moment where basically

291
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.549
he's in a persecuted community and he loves the

292
00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.789
idea of martyrs. And so when he's talking about

293
00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:04.239
Aesha, he leans into the martyrdom story, but he

294
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.250
had actually studied in Alexandria. And so he had

295
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.280
access to um substantial materials about what Aesha had

296
00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:14.289
done based on, you know, the time that he

297
00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:16.479
had spent in the city, we have a lot

298
00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:20.200
of historical narratives that talk about her murder. Um

299
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.530
And some of them do it in a way

300
00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:24.440
that contextualizes the murder to explain to an audience

301
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.419
why we should pay attention to this. Um These

302
00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:30.919
sources are really important for reconstructing what we know

303
00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:33.840
about her life. But we actually do have sources

304
00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:37.140
that were written by or about or to her,

305
00:16:37.219 --> 00:16:39.960
um, in the period before she died and those

306
00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:41.989
I think are much more valuable because that's where

307
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.760
you get out who she was as a person.

308
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.359
So we have the equivalent of her doctoral dissertation,

309
00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:51.669
um, which is a mathematical text. Uh, IT'S very

310
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.799
hard to read. Um, Greek mathematics are, you know,

311
00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.630
really tricky because for example, uh the numbers, the

312
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.940
whole numbers are done on a base 100 system,

313
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.550
the decimals are done on a base 60 system.

314
00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.810
And like Roman numerals, they're all letters. And so

315
00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.949
you'll be reading a text and there'll be mathematical

316
00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:15.510
things in there. And honestly, it's really hard to

317
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.420
even know when you're dealing with a whole number

318
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.069
in a decimal and what you do with it.

319
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.229
Um And so it is not a very accessible

320
00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:25.089
text, but it is hers. She did write it.

321
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.030
Um You know, we do have her work and

322
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.569
people smarter than me who know about how to

323
00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:33.949
read this, this numerical stuff, say that her um

324
00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:38.410
mathematics is pretty elegant. Um And uh the contribution

325
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.650
that she makes is in taking some very unwieldy

326
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.739
material and making it much more um sim much

327
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.390
simpler and much more um clear than what had

328
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.550
been done before. So I think we can say

329
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.310
from that, that she's a very gifted mathematician, but

330
00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:58.339
much more interesting for someone like me is uh

331
00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:00.239
we have a set of letters written by one

332
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.189
of her students. Um INCLUDING five letters written by

333
00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:07.030
Asia herself and then a couple of other, a

334
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.550
few other letters that mention life at her school.

335
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.160
Um And so for these, we have a document,

336
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.219
a set of documents that allow us to see

337
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:20.300
what it was like around her when she was

338
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.630
alive without this kind of filter of, we're setting

339
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.369
up a story to talk about how she dies.

340
00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.739
Um And so when we're, when we're reconstructing her

341
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.579
life, this is the kind of stuff we have

342
00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:34.239
to deal with. We're always struggling to distill out

343
00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:37.119
the person from the myth, but we do have

344
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.359
some things that relate to the person before there

345
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:43.439
even was the myth. Um And those are invaluable

346
00:18:43.449 --> 00:18:46.040
because you, it allows you to see this person

347
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.260
as she actually was and, you know, on the

348
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.510
terms that she sat while she was alive.

349
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.250
Mhm A and I guess that this is uh

350
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.949
an illustrative example of, mm I mean, a lot

351
00:18:57.959 --> 00:19:00.500
of the work that historians do, right? When it

352
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:05.819
comes to studying the life of historical figures many

353
00:19:05.829 --> 00:19:10.380
times, it's not that we have very well preserved

354
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.810
documents written by the person themselves, but we have

355
00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:20.479
to reserve to secondary tertiary sources, what other people

356
00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:24.359
said about them, wrote about them, what other people

357
00:19:24.369 --> 00:19:27.239
thought about them and so on. That's basically the

358
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.869
way we try to bring the pieces together,

359
00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:34.560
right? Yeah, I think um I think that that

360
00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:36.599
is a perfect summation of it. I think what

361
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:40.489
we're always doing as people um is trying to

362
00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:44.040
get through the filters that people create to understand

363
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.030
who the individual is. Um So, you know, in

364
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.329
a modern context, what you see on somebody's Instagram

365
00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:52.770
or what you see on their um youtube channel,

366
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.599
that's not who they are, that's who they want

367
00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:56.609
you to think they are. Maybe. Um IT'S the

368
00:19:56.619 --> 00:19:59.089
stories that they want you to, to read about

369
00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:02.390
them. It's, you know, it's a curated vision of

370
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.550
who that person is. Um We know that um

371
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.420
but in 100 years, I mean, assuming any of

372
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.380
this stuff is still around, um if you wanted

373
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.910
to reconstruct your life or my life using uh

374
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.180
you know, using the media that's out there about

375
00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:19.660
us, you would have a vision of us, but

376
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.599
it would be a vision that is curated and

377
00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:24.010
maybe it's very well curated and maybe it's very

378
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.359
sloppy, but it's a vision that doesn't relate to

379
00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:28.219
who we are so much as who we want

380
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.540
to be seen to be. And so historians are

381
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.650
always dealing with this problem as well. Um It

382
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.859
just, we have a lot less when we're dealing

383
00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:39.939
with somebody from the fourth century ad than when

384
00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:43.010
we're going through somebody's Instagram posts now. But this

385
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.229
is always the challenge. And so um when you

386
00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:51.099
have something that is transparently about creating a story

387
00:20:51.109 --> 00:20:54.275
that symbolizes somebody in some ways, it makes it

388
00:20:54.285 --> 00:20:57.194
easier because you know this person, you know what

389
00:20:57.204 --> 00:20:59.344
they're trying to do in telling the story this

390
00:20:59.354 --> 00:21:02.055
way. Um And so you're able to go through

391
00:21:02.084 --> 00:21:06.625
find the details that are legitimate details that this

392
00:21:06.635 --> 00:21:10.064
person has then transformed into an element of a

393
00:21:10.074 --> 00:21:12.564
story in the way they wanna tell. And you

394
00:21:12.574 --> 00:21:14.435
can take these details out and you can start

395
00:21:14.444 --> 00:21:18.040
building a picture um from the details that are

396
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.530
clearly facts um that the person telling the story

397
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.680
is using to support their larger argument. Those facts

398
00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:30.459
are still facts. And when you assemble enough of

399
00:21:30.469 --> 00:21:33.530
them, you have a set of ideas that are

400
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.489
grounded in something like reality. You can use to

401
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.189
talk about who the person was and what they're

402
00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:41.290
doing. Um And you know, and it's, it's the

403
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.040
work of a historian, but it's also the work

404
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.609
of, of everybody. You know, we are very well

405
00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:48.800
trained now in doing this um in a 21st

406
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.849
century environment. It's just we have a lot less

407
00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:54.569
when we're working with the fourth century,

408
00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:59.510
right? And do we know how exactly high Paia

409
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:05.020
got interested in philosophy, how she got into philosophy

410
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.079
and then how she eventually rose to prominence as

411
00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:11.030
a philosopher?

412
00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:15.060
Yeah, it's actually, it's a really fascinating story because

413
00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:18.750
um in antiquity, especially in, you know, the 4th

414
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.020
and 5th centuries, there's a real tendency among intellectuals

415
00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:28.290
to try to um keep the intellectual traditions in

416
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.859
the family. So a lot of intellectuals when they

417
00:22:31.869 --> 00:22:34.060
have Children. Um, IF they have a male child

418
00:22:34.069 --> 00:22:36.300
they want to train them in the ideas and

419
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.739
the traditions of the intellectual, um, intellectual pursuits that

420
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.050
the father specializes in. If they have a female

421
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.880
dog, a female child, they like to train their

422
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.800
daughter in these pursuits as well for a couple

423
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.800
reasons. I mean, the first is, it's great if

424
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.880
you own a school to marry your daughter to

425
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.060
like your top student. And we see a number

426
00:22:59.069 --> 00:23:01.920
of examples of this. Um, THE reason that they

427
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.880
like to do this is, of course, it keeps

428
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.489
the school in the family. Um, AND so, you

429
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.270
know, so you have your intellectual descendant and in

430
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.069
antiquity, if you studied under somebody, you were, you

431
00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:17.079
were called the son or daughter of the person

432
00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:20.589
that you studied under. Um, AND so you have

433
00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:24.930
your intellectual son marrying your biological daughter. That's great.

434
00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:28.250
Uh, BUT another thing that happens frequently is, you

435
00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.160
know, the daughters get married in their teens and

436
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.780
the sons can get married in their thirties or

437
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.310
forties. So it is very common for, um, for

438
00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:42.069
a husband in these relationships to be even a

439
00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:46.170
generation older than his wife. And he very frequently

440
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.500
will die before his wife. Um, SOMETIMES he'll die

441
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.040
before his wife. Um, AND before his child is

442
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.040
even old enough to go to school. And so

443
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:59.010
it's a tradition in these, um, intellectual families to

444
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.729
train their daughters in rhetoric. And philosophy and mathematics

445
00:24:04.939 --> 00:24:08.780
so that the daughters are capable of maintaining control

446
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.640
and, and supervising the education of the Children. So,

447
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.540
um so you have a lot of examples of

448
00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:19.270
women from intellectual families getting the equivalent of, um,

449
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.540
you know, almost a graduate degree. You know, they,

450
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.699
they go through a very significant course of study

451
00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:28.520
because it's their patrimony in a sense. Um And

452
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.790
they're going to be responsible for making sure that

453
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.709
the next generation of intellectuals in this family are

454
00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:38.000
trained uh appropriately and have, you know, the right

455
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.579
teachers and the right background and the right skills

456
00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:44.589
to succeed in this intellectual endeavor. And so this

457
00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:46.109
is how a patient was brought up, you know,

458
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:50.500
she, she's the daughter of the top um mathematician

459
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.140
and philosopher in the city of Alexandria. And it's

460
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.569
expected that she's gonna have that training. Um And

461
00:24:55.579 --> 00:24:58.719
I'm sure that what her father is anticipating is

462
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.739
she'll be trained in his school and in his

463
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.170
methods and, you know, and she'll be perfectly sufficient

464
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.689
in this and that will be great and she'll

465
00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:08.680
marry somebody um who will then probably leave the

466
00:25:08.689 --> 00:25:10.780
school and they'll have Children and she'll train the

467
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.619
Children and, you know, and that will be her

468
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.170
role. Um And what happens instead is Hypatia is

469
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.729
spectacular. I mean, she comes into the classroom and

470
00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:24.150
not, she's not gonna be, it becomes very clear,

471
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.180
she's not gonna be the wife of the successor.

472
00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:28.949
She's gonna be the successor uh because she is

473
00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:32.770
far better than anybody else, including her father. Uh

474
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.880
And so what hype begins doing is, you know,

475
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.650
she, she's learning the mathematics in the Alexandrian way.

476
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.839
This idea that mathematics um correlates to philosophical truth

477
00:25:43.849 --> 00:25:46.349
and the highest philosophical truth is actually understood through

478
00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:50.010
mathematics. And she starts reading the works of philosophers

479
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.719
like Plains and porphyry. And she realizes that's not

480
00:25:54.729 --> 00:25:58.229
true. She doesn't accept that, you know, she doesn't

481
00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:01.660
believe that mathematics is a higher level way to

482
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.119
understand philosophy. Actually, she thinks it's the reverse. Um

483
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:08.270
And so she wants to follow Plato and this

484
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.859
idea that yeah, math is helpful because it gives

485
00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:16.199
you very fixed ways to work with concepts. But

486
00:26:16.209 --> 00:26:20.290
the forms are actually superior to numbers. Numbers are

487
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.760
in numbers are precise but inaccurate and they don't

488
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.050
give you a full picture of the larger um

489
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.380
philosophical concepts. And I Pish reads this and she

490
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.640
says, you know what this is right? Um And

491
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.280
she's an exceptional mathematician, but she ultimately goes to

492
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.060
her father and convinces him, you know, what you've

493
00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:43.880
been doing this wrong. Um What, what you really

494
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.890
need to understand is concepts are more important than

495
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.069
numbers and concepts are where the higher level understanding

496
00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:54.829
of the universe lives, not in numbers, but in

497
00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:58.579
these ideas. Um And so we need to change

498
00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:01.030
the way we teach. And her father who is

499
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.699
a member of the, the Museum in Alexandria, um

500
00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:08.310
The top intellectual in the city. He not only

501
00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:12.189
agrees to this, he retires and lets her take

502
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.119
over the school while he's still alive because he

503
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.479
basically says, yeah, she's better than me. You know,

504
00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:21.000
she, she knows more than me. Um, SHE has

505
00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.469
a better vision for what this philosophy should do

506
00:27:23.699 --> 00:27:25.739
and she's a better teacher than me and a

507
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.349
better scholar than me. So why would I want

508
00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:32.359
to stand in her way? Like, let's let philosophy

509
00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:34.780
become better than I'm able to make it. Uh

510
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.199
And so he steps down and lets her take

511
00:27:37.209 --> 00:27:40.229
over the school. Um, YOU know, probably when she's

512
00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:41.160
in her thirties.

513
00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.599
Mhm. A and back then what was basically the

514
00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:51.650
social status of women? I mean, did people accept

515
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:57.060
that a woman herself would be the head of

516
00:27:57.069 --> 00:27:59.829
a philosophy school or not?

517
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.250
Uh So it was possible but it wasn't easy.

518
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.400
So, the, the um understanding is that um women

519
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:15.709
can lead intellectual institutions but they're always going to

520
00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:20.739
be facing, um, you know, people making jokes at

521
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.250
their expense, people discounting their expertise. Um, YOU know,

522
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.969
people making fun of the fact that they wear,

523
00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:31.650
when a philosopher um in antiquity would go out

524
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.709
in public, they would wear a specific robe called

525
00:28:34.729 --> 00:28:38.229
a Tron. Um It's kind of like when somebody

526
00:28:38.239 --> 00:28:41.030
gets their, their doctoral degree and they get these

527
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.910
robes from the university that are really like grandiose

528
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.689
and floppy hats and all of this kind of

529
00:28:46.699 --> 00:28:49.290
stuff. Um Yeah, I mean, there was the same

530
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.030
thing in antiquity, but you were expected actually to

531
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.449
wear that stuff around the city, um, especially in,

532
00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:57.969
you know, any kind of ceremonial occasion. And so

533
00:28:57.979 --> 00:29:01.040
she's wearing the philosopher's cloak and people joke. Well,

534
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.280
you know, it's a woman wearing the philosopher's cloak.

535
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.939
Like, isn't that funny? Um And in Greek, you

536
00:29:06.949 --> 00:29:09.989
actually can do something with the language where you

537
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.130
talk about, um, the act of wearing a tree

538
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.270
bone and it can have a masculine or feminine

539
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.089
ending and it always has a masculine ending except

540
00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:23.650
when they talk about Hypatia. Uh And so there

541
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.489
are authors that make a joke about like the

542
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.969
feminine ending of wearing a true bone and how

543
00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:30.640
funny it is that, you know, she's doing that.

544
00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:34.400
So her whole life she's dealing with this um

545
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.890
this understanding that yeah, it's possible for her to

546
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.270
run a school but also this kind of like

547
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.189
people giggling and joking and laughing about her and,

548
00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:48.079
and also more malicious things like people saying, well,

549
00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:50.579
she is a woman leading a philosophical school and

550
00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:53.449
all of the students are men and um a

551
00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:56.229
lot of philosophical teaching is done in public, but

552
00:29:56.239 --> 00:29:58.239
some of it is done in private, especially the

553
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:02.119
graduate level work where it's just the teacher and

554
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.680
the graduate students. And so that's maybe 1015 people

555
00:30:05.689 --> 00:30:08.300
at most. Um And so you have this environment

556
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.900
where you have Apacia and then 15 young men.

557
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.000
And so there are stories that start circulating about,

558
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.859
well, this is really like a sex cult or

559
00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:20.979
something. Um And Hypatia has to diffuse those stories

560
00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:24.650
too. So it is possible for a woman to

561
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.109
lead a school. It is there are other women

562
00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:30.150
who led schools, but it's much harder for a

563
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.380
woman to do that work than for a man

564
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.079
to do the same thing. Um And I think

565
00:30:35.089 --> 00:30:37.859
that's, that's what we have to acknowledge is uh

566
00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:42.290
Roman society is the sort of place that makes

567
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.500
it easier for men to do a lot of

568
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.900
things, but it doesn't wholly preclude women from doing

569
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.790
them. But if a woman chooses to do it,

570
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.439
um you know, something like teach philosophy, she chooses

571
00:30:54.449 --> 00:30:56.650
it, understanding full well that it is going to

572
00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.489
be much harder for her to do this work

573
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.430
than for a man to do it. And she's

574
00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:04.479
going to assume a lot of uh public scrutiny

575
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.089
that a man wouldn't get and she's going to

576
00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.030
have to deal with a lot of stuff that,

577
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.550
you know, a regular person probably doesn't want to

578
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.130
deal with. And so while women can do this

579
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.790
work, a lot of them say, you know what?

580
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.750
Yeah, I don't really want to run my own

581
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.650
school because I don't wanna be in, I don't

582
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.439
wanna have this kind of scrutiny and I don't

583
00:31:21.449 --> 00:31:26.079
wanna have this kind of um rumor mongering and,

584
00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:29.390
and public, you know, hostility. So a lot of

585
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.170
women in antiquity who teach philosophy, actually do it

586
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.140
as a kind of subordinate teacher in a school

587
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.479
that is run by a man that's much more

588
00:31:37.489 --> 00:31:40.670
common than a woman running her own school. Um

589
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.109
Mainly I think because, well, why do you want

590
00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:48.319
the extra hassles and scrutiny and trouble of running

591
00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:50.109
your own school when you can more or less

592
00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.800
do the same thing and you don't have to

593
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.239
deal with any of that. Um And so what

594
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.760
ape is choosing to do by taking over for

595
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.589
her father, um, is I think a very conscious

596
00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:06.520
choice uh to assume, to assume a lot of

597
00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.060
burdens that she didn't need to assume. I mean,

598
00:32:09.069 --> 00:32:12.109
she could have very happily continued teaching under her

599
00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:16.189
father and not dealt with any of this stuff.

600
00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:20.760
Right. So, I, I mean, this is very interesting

601
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.900
and I guess that will probably come back to

602
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.969
this point when, later on we talk about her

603
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.939
legacy. Uh BECAUSE, I mean, in that particular case,

604
00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:37.579
perhaps, even if there weren't really actual institutional and

605
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.680
legal, I guess barriers to her be a leading,

606
00:32:41.689 --> 00:32:47.170
uh, philosophy school, there were certain, certainly some social

607
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.979
and cultural barriers that she had to deal with.

608
00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:53.280
Uh, I guess that we can even call it

609
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.250
discrimination in a sense. Right.

610
00:32:56.459 --> 00:32:58.609
Yeah, I think that that's, I think that, um,

611
00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:02.109
I think one of the challenges that, that I

612
00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:04.660
had and I, and I, I still think I

613
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:10.209
have in conceptualizing the career of Hypatia is um

614
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.170
importing a kind of modern idea of what should

615
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.089
be fair um on an ancient context where I

616
00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:21.839
don't think she thought that way. Like I, I

617
00:33:21.849 --> 00:33:24.479
don't think she thought, well, it's unfair that I

618
00:33:24.489 --> 00:33:27.400
have to do these things, I think instead she

619
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.319
thought, well, this is my burden. Um This is

620
00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:33.589
how it is. And um you know, if I

621
00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:35.839
need to do this work, well, that's my path

622
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.079
and I choose this path. Um And so there

623
00:33:40.089 --> 00:33:43.880
wasn't any point in her saying something like this

624
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.760
is uh unequal treatment or this is um discrimination

625
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.920
against me. It wouldn't have made any difference to

626
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.329
the people listening. Um And she couldn't have changed

627
00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:56.260
that and I think she understood that. Um And

628
00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:00.319
so it's not that she's um leading a good,

629
00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:03.599
you know, 19th century struggle for women's suffrage or

630
00:34:03.609 --> 00:34:06.260
something. She doesn't expect that she's going to change

631
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.228
these conditions. Every woman is going to face these

632
00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.010
conditions if they wanna do what she's doing. Um

633
00:34:12.129 --> 00:34:14.810
She doesn't get into this to change those conditions.

634
00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.600
She gets into, she gets into teaching philosophy because

635
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.649
that's her mission. And if it means she has

636
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.389
to endure things that her male colleagues don't, well,

637
00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.120
then she has to endure things that her male

638
00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:30.810
colleagues don't. She's not in this to make things

639
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.600
more fair for women. She doesn't, I think, imagine

640
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.080
that that's possible. Um BUT it's certainly not what

641
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.000
she is aiming to do, even if she thought

642
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.399
it could be possible. Um, SHE is fully accepting

643
00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:47.840
the fact that for her entire life to perform

644
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.280
the mission that she believes she has to perform,

645
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.330
she is going to have to deal with um

646
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.489
much harsher conditions than she would face if she

647
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.629
was a man. Uh And so I think that

648
00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:01.330
that's one of the things that we struggle with

649
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:07.070
because we, we assume that um in a modern

650
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.510
context, if you take an action like that, it

651
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.389
might get better. You know, if, if you are

652
00:35:12.399 --> 00:35:14.669
a woman philosopher and you, you go into an

653
00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:18.530
environment that is hostile to female philosophers, we imagine

654
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.159
that the example of that woman philosopher might make

655
00:35:21.169 --> 00:35:25.370
that environment less hostile um Because she will, by

656
00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:29.489
her example, change perceptions. That is not, I think

657
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.250
what Hypatia is doing. I don't think she imagines

658
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.129
for, for a moment that she's gonna change perceptions

659
00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:37.729
or make things easier for the next female philosopher

660
00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:40.090
in the future. I think she understands that the

661
00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.889
conditions are going to remain bad for her for

662
00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:47.520
her entire life and she does it anyway. Um

663
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:52.530
And there's a particular um a particular kind of

664
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.050
a set of assumptions there that I don't think

665
00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.340
many people in the modern world really share.

666
00:35:58.419 --> 00:36:06.479
Mhm So what were her main intellectual contributions? What

667
00:36:06.489 --> 00:36:10.159
was she known for and is known for?

668
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.739
Uh SO I think one of the biggest things

669
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:16.100
that Iesha does of course, is is flipping Alexandria

670
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.540
from this strange way of thinking about philosophy to

671
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.989
this more conventional way of thinking about philosophy as

672
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.760
something guided by concepts, um larger concepts and larger

673
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.669
constructions of how the world should work. Uh I

674
00:36:30.679 --> 00:36:33.409
think we can't undersell that, right. This is taking,

675
00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:37.419
this is changing the entire intellectual identity of a

676
00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:41.550
city um and changing its way of functioning and

677
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.709
teaching uh and doing it very quickly and doing

678
00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:46.620
it as someone who is, you know, of course,

679
00:36:46.629 --> 00:36:50.389
something of an outsider because um there aren't many

680
00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:51.939
women who try to even do this and there

681
00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:54.290
are very, very few who actually succeed in doing

682
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.929
this. Um But then I think the other contribution

683
00:36:56.939 --> 00:36:59.120
that she makes is she understands how to take

684
00:36:59.129 --> 00:37:03.899
this tradition of um philosophical thought that she's inherited

685
00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:07.979
from thinkers like plains and porphyry and make it

686
00:37:07.989 --> 00:37:12.850
something that is nondenominational in a religious context. Um

687
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.379
What basically this philosophy said is there is a

688
00:37:16.389 --> 00:37:19.969
higher power, a a sort of unified divine entity

689
00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:22.169
and all of the world flows out of this

690
00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:25.729
um higher power. But it is possible if you

691
00:37:25.739 --> 00:37:30.810
really um distill down the essence of truth and

692
00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:34.669
focus your intellectual energies, it is possible for you

693
00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:37.300
as a human to ascend from this sort of

694
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:41.199
messy world of matter to this higher sort of

695
00:37:41.209 --> 00:37:44.820
spiritual plane and interact directly with the sort of

696
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:49.080
pure unfiltered wisdom that comes from this supreme entity.

697
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.330
What a patient realizes is this particular structure doesn't

698
00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.560
define who that supreme entity is. It doesn't say

699
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.439
this is a pagan supreme entity and Christians are

700
00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:02.780
wrong. What a basically says is, you know what,

701
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.850
this is a way of thinking about truth and

702
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.169
knowledge and I'm not gonna put a label on

703
00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:09.810
it. You know, um if you are a Christian

704
00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.260
and you believe that that supreme entity is a,

705
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.830
is a Christian God. Well, OK, you know, I

706
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.780
mean that, that great, you know, you do, you,

707
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.790
I do me as long as we believe in

708
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.699
this philosophical system and this, this contemplative approach. Um

709
00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:28.209
You don't need to put a label on what

710
00:38:28.219 --> 00:38:32.389
that divinity is to benefit from that particular approach.

711
00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:35.169
You as a person can reach a higher spiritual

712
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.790
plane. And you know, if you are a Christian,

713
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.110
you come from a Christian tradition, this is a

714
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.149
contemplative activity. And so you, you can still go

715
00:38:44.159 --> 00:38:46.659
to church, right? I'm not requiring you to do

716
00:38:46.669 --> 00:38:49.530
pagan sacrifices to reach this Supreme God. And if

717
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.199
you're a pagan, um I'm not requiring you to

718
00:38:52.209 --> 00:38:54.770
do pagan sacrifices to reach the Supreme God. Either

719
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.449
you can be in the same room with this

720
00:38:56.459 --> 00:39:00.209
Christian thinking these same ideas, interacting with these same

721
00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:03.760
concepts and having the same benefits that come from

722
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.409
being a philosopher. Um WHETHER you're pagan or Christian

723
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.370
and no one was doing this in the war

724
00:39:12.379 --> 00:39:13.979
in the Roman world at the later part of

725
00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:16.949
the fourth century. Um, WHAT I think she realized

726
00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:19.810
is she lives in a Christian majority city. She

727
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.570
lives in a city where, um, pagans and Christians

728
00:39:22.929 --> 00:39:26.939
disagree about a lot of things sometimes violently and

729
00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:31.570
yet, um, there is a way philosophically to make

730
00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.689
everybody better in a way that doesn't require you

731
00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:38.889
to be pagan or Christian. Um, THERE is instead

732
00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:42.379
a common path that everybody can follow that is

733
00:39:42.389 --> 00:39:46.330
open to both pagans and Christians, but is philosophical

734
00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.729
and is firmly grounded in, you know, 700 years

735
00:39:50.739 --> 00:39:54.090
of thinking by people like Socrates and Plato and

736
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.639
Aristotle. And so the contribution that Ape makes is,

737
00:39:57.649 --> 00:40:00.949
is to create a way for philosophy to function

738
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.179
in a Christian majority environment. Um And to function

739
00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:09.159
well and meaningfully for both Christians and pagans without

740
00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:12.780
requiring them to compromise their religious beliefs or to

741
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.389
do things that might run afoul of um the

742
00:40:15.399 --> 00:40:17.419
religious practices of their communities.

743
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:24.000
So she was a philosopher, but she also participated

744
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:28.340
in the politics of Alexandria, right? Uh If and

745
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.159
if so, in what ways did she do it?

746
00:40:31.169 --> 00:40:35.959
And uh also how did that tie to her

747
00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:38.840
ideas about public service?

748
00:40:39.629 --> 00:40:43.239
Yeah, I think that um this is a key

749
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.020
part of what it meant to be a philosopher

750
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.449
in antiquity, this idea of public service. Um One

751
00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:51.370
of the, the key obligations that people from the

752
00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:55.250
philosophical tradition that I belong to uh believe they

753
00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.649
assumed was this responsibility to instruct everybody. You know,

754
00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:03.280
this goes back to Socrates, right? And this, this,

755
00:41:03.379 --> 00:41:07.610
this responsibility to instruct everybody to the degree that

756
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:12.389
a person is capable of understanding um the political

757
00:41:12.459 --> 00:41:16.439
and ethical concepts that made society better. And so

758
00:41:16.449 --> 00:41:18.800
it was the obligation of a of a practicing

759
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:22.419
philosopher to speak to everyone in their city. And

760
00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:26.709
if they are intelligent and um well read and

761
00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:30.459
interested, you can train them in highest level philosophy

762
00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:33.709
so that they can ascend to this intellectual level

763
00:41:33.719 --> 00:41:36.669
and interact with the supreme divinity. That's great. But

764
00:41:36.679 --> 00:41:39.790
that's not everybody that's actually not most people. Um

765
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.449
Instead your obligation is to figure out, ok, I'm

766
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:46.550
talking to this person, their intellectual level is, is

767
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.820
here. How do I make them better? How do

768
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.590
I make them more philosophical? They're never gonna understand

769
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.110
the supreme divinity. They're not capable of doing that,

770
00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:58.639
but maybe they are capable of understanding justice in

771
00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.139
a, in a more rudimentary way. Well, then my

772
00:42:01.149 --> 00:42:03.540
job is to instruct them in how to behave

773
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.580
more justly towards their fellow citizens. Um And so,

774
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.090
Hypatia, it was her um obligation as a philosopher

775
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.800
to interact politically with the people around her and

776
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.639
to train them to behave better in a way

777
00:42:19.649 --> 00:42:23.979
that was consistent with philosophical practice, but also was

778
00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:28.050
um calibrated so that it was consistent with their

779
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.840
ability to implement those, those teachings. Um And so

780
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.000
our patient, very much believed that in the city

781
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.050
of Alexandria, she needed to be available to anybody,

782
00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:42.860
anybody who wanted to receive her guidance. Uh So

783
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.840
that meant that she kept her house more or

784
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.639
less open to anybody who wanted to come in

785
00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:50.760
and get help. Uh And sometimes that meant she

786
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.550
would help them in a lawsuit. Sometimes that meant

787
00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.989
they were new to the city and she would

788
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.209
help them find an apartment or a job. Uh

789
00:42:57.229 --> 00:42:59.270
And sometimes that meant she would talk to them

790
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.260
about God, but she made sure that she was

791
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:08.139
available to everybody um to help them in whatever

792
00:43:08.149 --> 00:43:11.010
way was most appropriate to their needs so that

793
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.850
she could make her city more broadly, um a

794
00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.199
better, more philosophical place. Uh And she would do

795
00:43:17.209 --> 00:43:20.709
this individually, she would also do this collectively. She

796
00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:24.629
would give speeches, she would um meet with governors,

797
00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:28.419
she would interact with the city council. Um You

798
00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:31.449
know, she, she saw it as her obligation to

799
00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:38.010
do political activities in every context um to make

800
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.010
philosophy felt in the public life of her city.

801
00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.020
And so with the events then led to her

802
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.020
death, what happened? Exactly.

803
00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:52.699
Yeah. So this is uh this is one of

804
00:43:52.709 --> 00:43:57.629
those particularly Alexandrian tragedies. Um When we talk, when

805
00:43:57.639 --> 00:44:00.020
we talked earlier about what is the dynamic like

806
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.139
in this city? You know, we talked about how

807
00:44:02.149 --> 00:44:04.389
this is a very dense city. Um There are

808
00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:10.020
a lot of people and uh these conflicts between

809
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.949
these people frequently became violent. Uh And so what

810
00:44:13.959 --> 00:44:17.810
happened in the year 412 was you, you had

811
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.389
the death of the leader of the Christian community

812
00:44:20.399 --> 00:44:24.149
in the city of Alexandria. Um MAN named Theophilus

813
00:44:24.389 --> 00:44:28.340
and Theophilus had presided over a real significant outbreak

814
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.979
of violence in the early three nineties. But for

815
00:44:30.989 --> 00:44:32.929
the next generation, I mean, for the next like

816
00:44:32.939 --> 00:44:36.800
20 years, he and hypatia and people like hype

817
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.060
had um created a kind of common understanding that

818
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.879
this level of violence was, was a real problem

819
00:44:44.889 --> 00:44:47.159
and they wanted to tone it down. Um And

820
00:44:47.169 --> 00:44:50.060
so they had built a kind of way for

821
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.260
the leading members of the Christian community and people

822
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:56.669
like, aha and the leading sort of civic officials

823
00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:59.580
to coexist, you know, and, and to let their

824
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:05.370
differences be resolved through communication and um conversation rather

825
00:45:05.379 --> 00:45:09.510
than violence. Uh But in 412, Theophilus died and

826
00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.790
there was a contested um election about who should

827
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.949
succeed him as the bishop of Alexandria. Uh THAT,

828
00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:19.149
you know, because it's Alexandria resulted in violence. Um

829
00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:22.510
And the person who, who came out on top

830
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.120
in the violence was um Theophilus nephew Cyril. Uh

831
00:45:27.129 --> 00:45:29.800
The problem that Sil had is the violence had

832
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.929
been significant enough that there were communities in Alexandria

833
00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:34.750
that actually weren't Christian that had weighed in on

834
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.689
this, including the city's very large Jewish community. Um

835
00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:42.209
So Alexandria is maybe 10 to 20% Jewish where

836
00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:45.159
the numbers vary. Um They're never a majority, they

837
00:45:45.169 --> 00:45:46.760
know they're never going to be a majority, but

838
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.689
there are significant enough community uh that you do

839
00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:51.760
have to pay attention to them if you're an

840
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:55.659
official in Alexandria. Uh And so, so Cyril starts

841
00:45:55.669 --> 00:46:00.000
taking action against Christian communities that opposed him, um

842
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:03.320
administrators that opposed him and Jewish people who opposed

843
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.510
him. Uh And eventually the governor of Alexandria has

844
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.260
to step in and try to calm things down.

845
00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:13.149
And what he decides to do is build a

846
00:46:13.159 --> 00:46:16.350
coalition of people who are not supporters of Cyril

847
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.489
to try to rein the bishop in and he

848
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.800
more or less elects hype to build this co

849
00:46:21.919 --> 00:46:26.929
this um coalition. So Hypatia do does what she's

850
00:46:26.939 --> 00:46:30.250
supposed to do. She's a philosopher, she's been called

851
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.929
by a leader in her city to um step

852
00:46:32.939 --> 00:46:35.570
in and try to make the city calmer and

853
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.280
more philosophical and she has succeeded in doing this

854
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:44.550
in the past. Um So she starts working with

855
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.629
the governor to try to create political conditions in

856
00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:49.909
the city that are calmer and, you know, and

857
00:46:49.919 --> 00:46:54.469
marginalize Cyril at the same time. Uh Cyril knows

858
00:46:54.479 --> 00:46:58.590
that he would be hard pressed to actually go

859
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.540
after the governor. And so he starts making noises

860
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.459
about is this is IPA fault. You know, she's

861
00:47:06.469 --> 00:47:08.739
the reason that we aren't, we aren't getting along.

862
00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:11.530
Um There is a riot in which some of

863
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.600
serial supporters attack the governor. They throw a rock

864
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.419
at his head, um the person who did this

865
00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:20.090
is arrested and executed. And at this point, the

866
00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.570
rhetoric against hype becomes more aggressive. So we see

867
00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.050
in our sources, um so very clear indications that

868
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.750
people around Cyril were saying things like Ape is

869
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.719
a witch. She's a magician, you know, she is

870
00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:36.860
using magic to um make the governor not like

871
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:40.439
Cyril. And you know, and for this reason, um

872
00:47:40.449 --> 00:47:42.919
something needs to be done. Now, we don't know

873
00:47:42.929 --> 00:47:45.649
that Cyril himself said this. Um BUT there are

874
00:47:45.659 --> 00:47:50.389
supporters of Cyril who decide that this, this uh

875
00:47:50.399 --> 00:47:54.290
gives them grounds to attack Apacia. Um And so

876
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.800
this is kind of the lead up to her

877
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:59.050
murder. There is this, this growing tension in Alexandria,

878
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:04.620
it is this sort of periodic um move from

879
00:48:04.629 --> 00:48:07.719
conversation to violence that happens every generation or so

880
00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:10.179
in Alexandria. Uh And this is how she gets

881
00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:13.389
caught up in it. And

882
00:48:13.399 --> 00:48:17.929
so what was then the aftermath of her death?

883
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.770
How did people respond to it?

884
00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.030
So the murder of Hypatia happens in Lent. Um

885
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.879
It doesn't seem that Cyril spoke directly to. This

886
00:48:30.889 --> 00:48:34.290
doesn't seem that Cyril said go kill hype. Um

887
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.219
It doesn't even seem that Cyril endorsed it after

888
00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:41.030
the fact. Uh But what you, what you have

889
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.659
are uh sit you have a situation where because

890
00:48:43.669 --> 00:48:48.000
hype is so publicly available, it's actually easy to

891
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.260
grab her. What happens frequently in the Roman world

892
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:56.889
is mobs get angry at elites and most frequently,

893
00:48:56.899 --> 00:48:59.260
what happens is the elites lived in these houses

894
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.580
that are very well fortified. You know, they have

895
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.020
a big gate. If you've been to the Mediterranean,

896
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.429
you've been to the city of Rome even, you

897
00:49:05.439 --> 00:49:09.580
know, like the houses have very strong out facing

898
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.979
walls, very big doors, very strong gates. There's a

899
00:49:11.989 --> 00:49:14.689
reason for that, right? Uh Mobs might come to

900
00:49:14.699 --> 00:49:16.159
try to get you. And most of the time

901
00:49:16.169 --> 00:49:18.850
what happens is they come, the gate is there.

902
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.040
You have um, bodyguards, they yell, they scream, maybe

903
00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.810
if they're really mad, um, they might throw something

904
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.760
to try to burn your house down. But most

905
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.550
of the time you're not there at that point.

906
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.110
And, you know, and it's a ritual almost where

907
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.189
if you are um expressing your discontent about the

908
00:49:38.199 --> 00:49:40.989
behavior of a leading person in a Roman city,

909
00:49:41.689 --> 00:49:43.810
most of the time, it actually doesn't become violent.

910
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:46.149
They are intending to scare you, you know what's

911
00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:48.409
going on and you moderate your behavior if, if

912
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.030
it bothers you and a lot of the time,

913
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.899
everybody knows that this is the, this is the

914
00:49:52.909 --> 00:49:55.520
game, but her patient doesn't live that way. You

915
00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.389
know, she doesn't live behind walls with shut doors

916
00:49:58.399 --> 00:50:01.030
and, and closed gates. Um, WHEN she travels in

917
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.820
the city, she doesn't do it with bodyguards and,

918
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:06.989
you know, carried in a litter and protected. She

919
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.780
walks like a normal person. She behaves like a

920
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.020
normal person. Her door is open. And so if

921
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.750
you're angry at Hypatia, um you might have expected

922
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.750
that you left that day to go and yell

923
00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.629
outside of her door to intimidate her. But suddenly

924
00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:23.840
you find her in the street and she's not

925
00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.719
protected and there's nobody preventing you from doing anything.

926
00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.600
The mob loses control and it seizes Hypatia and

927
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.280
it kills her and it kills her very brutally.

928
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.040
Um They take her to a public square. Um

929
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.909
They take broken roof tiles and they tear her

930
00:50:38.919 --> 00:50:42.479
body apart and then they burn her body um

931
00:50:42.489 --> 00:50:45.199
in public as a way to purify the city

932
00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:49.040
from the um wickedness that's supposedly attached to her.

933
00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:52.439
Um I don't think Cyril knew this was gonna

934
00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:55.379
happen. I don't think Cyril was particularly thrilled that

935
00:50:55.389 --> 00:50:59.139
it did happen. Um And the outcry that you

936
00:50:59.149 --> 00:51:02.209
see in sources suggests that there is almost nobody

937
00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:05.419
in the entire Roman Empire, Christian or Pagan who

938
00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:09.510
thinks this was justified. Um There's an imperial commission

939
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.429
that's sent to investigate this. Cyril escapes punishment um

940
00:51:13.439 --> 00:51:18.429
for instigating this, this riot by basically bribing the

941
00:51:18.439 --> 00:51:22.419
commissioners so that um he doesn't get found, you

942
00:51:22.429 --> 00:51:26.639
know, responsible. Uh ONE of the organizations that Cyril

943
00:51:26.649 --> 00:51:29.429
and the Alexandrian church had used as a kind

944
00:51:29.439 --> 00:51:34.340
of um way to mobilize supporters and pressure opponents.

945
00:51:34.489 --> 00:51:38.750
Uh This is disbanded by imperial officials despite Cyril's

946
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:43.530
bribes and all of our sources um written in

947
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.419
the immediate aftermath of Isac death. Talk about this

948
00:51:47.429 --> 00:51:50.889
like it is an extremely serious breach in the

949
00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:53.469
social fabric of the Roman Empire. Uh One of

950
00:51:53.479 --> 00:51:55.120
these sources that I think is, is one of

951
00:51:55.129 --> 00:51:57.969
the most interesting, has a, an entire to the

952
00:51:57.979 --> 00:52:00.090
end of his history. And he has an entire

953
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.449
narrative where he's talking about how Roman society is

954
00:52:03.459 --> 00:52:05.919
coming apart. And he gives a set of examples

955
00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:09.350
from the four tens. Um The, you know, the

956
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.350
first one is a set of um violent confrontations

957
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.520
of constantinople that are, that are diffused more or

958
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.449
less because he thinks the bishop did a good

959
00:52:17.459 --> 00:52:20.659
job. The next one is the sack of Rome

960
00:52:20.669 --> 00:52:23.399
by Alaric in 410. You know, the event that

961
00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:27.899
like beyond everything else in our imagination, um symbolizes

962
00:52:27.909 --> 00:52:30.929
the decline of Roman, you know, Roman power and

963
00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:34.050
Roman virtue and, and Roman um integrity in the

964
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.750
fifth century. For him, the murder of Hypatia is

965
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.239
an even more powerful symbol of the decline of

966
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.790
the Roman Empire than the sack of Rome. The

967
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.429
sack of Rome is, you know, the lead up

968
00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:51.479
to what he sees as indicative of Roman society

969
00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:53.550
is coming apart and it's the murder of Apacia

970
00:52:53.719 --> 00:52:58.219
because for him, she is a person who is

971
00:52:58.229 --> 00:53:03.620
just and true and behaving in a fashion that

972
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:07.800
um you cannot attack as partisan. What she's trying

973
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.830
to do is make her society better in the

974
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.479
purest way imaginable, not for material benefit, not because

975
00:53:14.489 --> 00:53:17.510
she can like get an office out of it.

976
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.560
Not because she can seize imperial power. She's trying

977
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.580
to make her city better and, and her world

978
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.800
better because she believes it is her job to

979
00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:27.300
make her city and her world better and she

980
00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:30.590
dies for it. And so for Socrates Scholastics and

981
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.540
a lot of people like him, this is a

982
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.989
symbol of a sort of rip in the fabric

983
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.250
of the Roman world. Um THAT is incomprehensible. You

984
00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.959
know, this is a person who is acting with

985
00:53:40.969 --> 00:53:43.979
pure and true motives, who's killed because of those

986
00:53:43.989 --> 00:53:47.159
actions. And he doesn't see how society comes back

987
00:53:47.169 --> 00:53:47.600
from that.

988
00:53:49.389 --> 00:53:54.439
And so in the centuries following her death, um

989
00:53:54.969 --> 00:53:59.850
looking at, I don't know, other uh intellectuals and

990
00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:04.010
even artists the way they have portrayed their reacted

991
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.010
to her. I mean, first of all, how common

992
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:11.379
is it across the history of philosophy for other

993
00:54:11.389 --> 00:54:15.280
philosophers to actually get in touch with her work

994
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.409
or even become aware of her?

995
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.290
Um Nobody reads her work now that that commentary

996
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.860
is, you know, nobody really works on that material.

997
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:30.590
There's maybe 10 people in the world who work

998
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.459
on that material and the people who work in

999
00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:34.989
it don't read her commentary. Um You know, so

1000
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.919
I think in terms of her actual work, her

1001
00:54:37.929 --> 00:54:43.280
published work, um it's basically forgotten in terms of

1002
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.689
the imp the impact of her actions that is

1003
00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:49.909
not forgotten at all. Um I think if you,

1004
00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:53.550
at one point, I looked at um how, how

1005
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.870
many philosophers from antiquity, you know, who are the

1006
00:54:55.879 --> 00:54:58.989
most common philosophers in antiquity? Uh If you do

1007
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.030
Google searches for their mentions and it's, you know,

1008
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:07.699
it's the big three. So Plato Aristotle IPAC number

1009
00:55:07.709 --> 00:55:10.389
four. And so what is it that actually matters

1010
00:55:10.399 --> 00:55:14.550
about Apacia? It's actually, I think these, the deeds,

1011
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.629
it's what she did. Um And this is something

1012
00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:20.929
that I think a lot of philosophers until very

1013
00:55:20.939 --> 00:55:24.979
recently downplayed philosophy is about thought and it's about

1014
00:55:24.989 --> 00:55:29.110
concepts, but it's about actions also. And so in

1015
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.560
antiquity, um as you know, the, the French philosopher

1016
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.850
Pierre do says, you know, actually philosophy is about

1017
00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.500
what you do. It's a way of life. And

1018
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.540
what I think you get from hypia is not

1019
00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:46.699
so much. There's this particular doctrine that Apacia pioneered

1020
00:55:46.709 --> 00:55:49.600
or this particular way of, of solving a philosophical

1021
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.340
problem that Apacia um discovered what you have is

1022
00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.530
somebody who in a most pure way embodies a

1023
00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.280
way of life, a philosophical way of life um

1024
00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:03.860
in a fashion that was consistent across her entire

1025
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:07.550
life and also um led to her death. And

1026
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.330
so I think when philosophers consider the influence of

1027
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.350
a way of life, this too is why Socrates

1028
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.209
matters to us. There's no writings from Socrates, but

1029
00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:21.260
we remember Socrates, because what Socrates did is embodied

1030
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.649
a way of life in a fashion that was

1031
00:56:23.659 --> 00:56:27.459
particularly memorable and true and uncompromising. That's what Apea

1032
00:56:27.659 --> 00:56:30.250
did as well. Um YOU know, it's a different

1033
00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.969
moment than Socrates. She's a different person than Socrates.

1034
00:56:34.469 --> 00:56:38.250
But her legacy is as important uh or is,

1035
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.790
is important like Socrates because like Socrates, she embodied

1036
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.350
a way of life that philosophers believe to be

1037
00:56:45.429 --> 00:56:49.100
admirable. Um And a way of life that philosophers

1038
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:53.560
believe should be emulated if one actually lives according

1039
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.379
to the philosophical principles that one expounds.

1040
00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:03.040
So, uh could we say that she has been

1041
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:08.770
influential as a philosopher or not?

1042
00:57:09.479 --> 00:57:12.429
Uh You know, again, I think um a lot

1043
00:57:12.439 --> 00:57:14.699
of philosophers would say she has no influence on

1044
00:57:14.709 --> 00:57:19.489
modern philosophy. Uh I would say that what I

1045
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.189
would say, actually the opposite. I think she has

1046
00:57:22.199 --> 00:57:27.750
tremendous influence as um as a philosopher in the

1047
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.189
way that most people think about philosophy. You know,

1048
00:57:31.199 --> 00:57:33.750
I, I think most of us agree that philosophy

1049
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:38.870
is something that um should not be just an

1050
00:57:38.879 --> 00:57:42.659
abstract thing about concepts that have no bearing on

1051
00:57:42.669 --> 00:57:45.659
the world around us. Who cares about that? You

1052
00:57:45.669 --> 00:57:47.709
know, it, it, it's not why most of us

1053
00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:50.149
are interested in philosophy. It's not why lots and

1054
00:57:50.159 --> 00:57:52.949
lots and lots of people read stoicism. Now nobody's

1055
00:57:52.959 --> 00:57:55.110
reading Stoicism because they want to think more deeply

1056
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.439
about, I don't know the, the end of the,

1057
00:57:57.469 --> 00:58:00.060
you know, the end of the universe or something.

1058
00:58:00.219 --> 00:58:02.590
Um They're thinking about stoicism because what it does

1059
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.479
is it offers a very clear way to function

1060
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:09.649
practically in the world. It offers practical ethics and,

1061
00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:12.449
and a way for us to um come up

1062
00:58:12.459 --> 00:58:14.889
with a way of life that makes our ability

1063
00:58:14.899 --> 00:58:17.570
to function in this environment that we inhabit better.

1064
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:20.909
That's what philosophy ultimately does for most people who

1065
00:58:20.919 --> 00:58:24.270
are interested in philosophy. That's what Hypatia does. You

1066
00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.590
know, that's where she contributes to philosophy is. She

1067
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.919
gives us in its almost purest form. Somebody who

1068
00:58:30.929 --> 00:58:33.320
is devoted to this idea that there is an

1069
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:36.989
ethical way to behave, that's guided by higher principles

1070
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.270
that can be organized systematically. And it is possible

1071
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.659
to live your life consistently with that. And it

1072
00:58:44.669 --> 00:58:47.179
is possible to do it in a fashion that

1073
00:58:47.189 --> 00:58:51.500
is so uncompromising that you, you even give your

1074
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:54.409
life to the principles that your um manner of

1075
00:58:54.419 --> 00:58:56.949
behaving in bodies. That's where I think her legacy

1076
00:58:56.959 --> 00:58:58.610
is most strong and that's why we still talk

1077
00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.030
about her, you know, because for most people, philosophy

1078
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.979
isn't about like a particular doctrine of the soul

1079
00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.419
or a particular like way of approaching, I don't

1080
00:59:09.429 --> 00:59:12.209
know, atomic particles or something. Philosophy is about how

1081
00:59:12.219 --> 00:59:13.770
do you live better in the world around you?

1082
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.030
That's what she was, that's what she did, you

1083
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.620
know, and that's what her example allows us to

1084
00:59:17.629 --> 00:59:17.959
see.

1085
00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:23.320
But then, uh I mean, when it comes to

1086
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:28.139
uh the history of philosophy itself and uh how

1087
00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:32.979
we she might or might not have influenced other

1088
00:59:32.989 --> 00:59:37.850
philosophers and the way philosophy developed in the West,

1089
00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:42.270
particularly, uh I'm asking you this because many times

1090
00:59:42.479 --> 00:59:48.379
we hear about Apacia and other female historical female

1091
00:59:48.389 --> 00:59:54.340
philosophers when there's, for example, some feminist philosophers talking

1092
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:58.995
about them and even mentioning also some other contemporary

1093
00:59:59.004 --> 01:00:03.344
female philosophers that because they are women, they say

1094
01:00:03.354 --> 01:00:07.385
that's one of the main reasons why they haven't

1095
01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:11.645
played really a prominent role in the history of

1096
01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:17.435
philosophy or been very intellectually influential or something like

1097
01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:21.225
that. What do you think about that? Do you

1098
01:00:21.235 --> 01:00:24.379
think that that might have played a role there?

1099
01:00:24.389 --> 01:00:28.129
The fact that she was a woman compared to,

1100
01:00:28.139 --> 01:00:34.770
for example, prominent figures like Aristotle later and others

1101
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.459
after them,

1102
01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:39.199
I think that the biggest reason we don't have

1103
01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:42.649
philosophical works by Hypatia um actually is because of

1104
01:00:42.659 --> 01:00:45.209
her murder. Um BECAUSE what her murder does is

1105
01:00:45.219 --> 01:00:48.810
it destroys this philosophical tradition in Alexandria that she

1106
01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:53.219
was building um the Athenian, the rivalry between Athens

1107
01:00:53.229 --> 01:00:56.750
and Alexandria was very real during Ab's life. But

1108
01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.979
in Athens, there was a tradition that was exclusively

1109
01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.919
pagan and actually involved pagan sacrifices as part of

1110
01:01:03.929 --> 01:01:06.719
your philosophical practice. So for a pia, the idea

1111
01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:10.919
of unifying with this spiritual realm was contemplative. You

1112
01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:14.540
know, you would um focus your life on philosophical

1113
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.800
principles, you would eventually come to a point where

1114
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:20.600
your mind was so undisturbed that it could ascend

1115
01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.879
to this level where you interacted with the divine.

1116
01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.159
And that was something that both Christians and pagans

1117
01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:28.199
could do in the same room in Athens. The

1118
01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:30.590
tradition was well, OK. Yeah, I mean, in theory,

1119
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.320
you can do that but you can actually um

1120
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.149
you can't do it that often and it's really

1121
01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:37.250
hard to do. And so you can move to

1122
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.729
this level by doing certain rituals that help you

1123
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.530
move to this level. And those rituals are of

1124
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.639
course, pagan rituals because these philosophers are pagan. Um

1125
01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:50.479
WHEN Hypatia is killed, her version of that philosophy

1126
01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:53.270
is killed with her. Um And so the, the

1127
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.209
tradition that she embodies it, it gets snuffed. And

1128
01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:01.370
so the texts that were consistent with that tradition,

1129
01:02:01.389 --> 01:02:04.320
once you know, the Athenian tradition develops out of

1130
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.330
the ideas of a, a teacher named the Omics

1131
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.870
in the fourth century. Plains and porphyry were texts

1132
01:02:09.879 --> 01:02:12.879
that both the Omics and Hypatia read. Hypia, didn't

1133
01:02:12.889 --> 01:02:15.439
interact with the Omics at all. And so the

1134
01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:18.659
Athenian tradition uses Plains and porphyry just as Hypatia

1135
01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.729
would have. But Apacia interaction with them is not

1136
01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:25.219
something that they are interested in. So, um this

1137
01:02:25.229 --> 01:02:29.290
Athenian tradition then becomes the dominant force in philosophy

1138
01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.649
in the fifth century because Hypatia has been killed.

1139
01:02:32.179 --> 01:02:35.169
Um And the, the reason that we don't talk

1140
01:02:35.179 --> 01:02:38.919
about Hypatia is because that Athenian tradition is the

1141
01:02:38.929 --> 01:02:43.399
tradition, ultimately that moves into Arab philosophy and it

1142
01:02:43.409 --> 01:02:47.110
moves into Byzantine philosophy. And so when Byzantine philosophers

1143
01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.840
are interacting with philosophy from the 4th and 5th

1144
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.280
centuries, they're interacting with the Athenian philosophy, not the

1145
01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:56.530
Hyatt philosophy. And so um what it it is

1146
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.370
an accident in a sense of his, of history

1147
01:02:59.379 --> 01:03:03.209
that a conflict between one set of approaches to

1148
01:03:03.219 --> 01:03:05.790
philosophy based in Athens and another set based in

1149
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.989
Alexandria didn't happen because Hypatia was killed and when

1150
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.280
she's killed, the school ends. Um And so her

1151
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:18.070
intellectual legacy is snuffed out because of the murder.

1152
01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:21.459
So the, the, the texts and the um the

1153
01:03:21.469 --> 01:03:25.080
system, all of this stuff is destroyed because there

1154
01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.780
is no one to pick it up. So it

1155
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:30.580
doesn't make it out of antiquity and into Byzantium.

1156
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.629
And then this Byzantine tradition is what fino and

1157
01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:37.060
the Florentines. And um and ultimately, you know, our

1158
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:40.889
entire structure of Western philosophy, that's where it comes

1159
01:03:40.899 --> 01:03:44.459
from. Um And so it is really in a

1160
01:03:44.469 --> 01:03:48.429
weird way, you know, her murder leaves this legacy

1161
01:03:48.439 --> 01:03:51.889
of practical philosophy that is unmatched by anybody from

1162
01:03:51.899 --> 01:03:56.550
that Athenian tradition, but it destroys the textual tradition

1163
01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.189
and the, the systematic sort of evolution of her

1164
01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:02.979
ideas um in a fashion that is unrecoverable. So

1165
01:04:02.989 --> 01:04:04.350
I think that, you know, I think that there

1166
01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.379
is a, a really, it's a really unfortunate situation

1167
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:13.699
because it is possible that that Athenian tradition would

1168
01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:17.659
have been defeated by a Hyatt Alexandrian tradition. And

1169
01:04:17.669 --> 01:04:21.919
our philosophical tradition would actually now not be Elis

1170
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.909
and all of the things that we see coming

1171
01:04:23.919 --> 01:04:26.830
out of 5th and 6th century Athens, it would

1172
01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.199
instead be Hypatia and a bunch of things that

1173
01:04:30.209 --> 01:04:32.840
would then come out of the descendants from her

1174
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:35.520
line in Alexandria. And that's what was destroyed in

1175
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:36.139
415.

1176
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:40.830
So, at least in this particular case of Hypatia,

1177
01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.580
you don't think there's good enough evidence to suppose

1178
01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:50.290
that one of the reasons she's been mostly uh

1179
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:56.169
ignored in the more, let's say, textual, actual philosophical

1180
01:04:56.179 --> 01:05:01.310
tradition in the West is much more accidental than

1181
01:05:01.639 --> 01:05:05.689
for uh than because of her being a woman.

1182
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.060
I think so. Um You know, I just, I

1183
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:13.840
think it, it is certainly possible that if in

1184
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.739
the 17th century we had texts by hype, someone

1185
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.159
would have made the decision to read other things

1186
01:05:20.169 --> 01:05:22.939
instead because she was a woman. Um And there

1187
01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:26.010
is actually, there's a really interesting example of a

1188
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.600
female mathematician named PDR who um we know about,

1189
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:34.909
she ran her own school and um and she,

1190
01:05:34.919 --> 01:05:37.969
you know, because of hypatia sort of work in

1191
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:42.310
destroying this mathematical consensus, um her work and the

1192
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.429
work of the people engaging with her is not

1193
01:05:44.439 --> 01:05:47.510
very well preserved either. But it's interesting that the

1194
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.879
people who edited the text that mentions Pedroia's work

1195
01:05:51.969 --> 01:05:56.139
actually just there was a, a feminine article that,

1196
01:05:56.149 --> 01:06:00.790
you know, like she's marked as erosion. And the

1197
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.500
person editing the text said, well, that must be

1198
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:04.689
an error because it says she's a woman. So

1199
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:08.110
they changed the text to say whole Pandian to

1200
01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.760
say she's a man and people went back and

1201
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.540
said, wait a second. No, I mean, she's a

1202
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:15.080
woman it's clear she's a woman, you know. So

1203
01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:19.629
there, there are definitely possibilities that had IPAs work

1204
01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:22.870
survived into the 17th or 18th century. Somebody would

1205
01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:26.459
have said exactly, you know, exactly this. Right. Well,

1206
01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:28.459
maybe she's not a woman or, you know, or

1207
01:06:28.469 --> 01:06:30.189
this work is not as good because she's a

1208
01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:33.580
woman. Nobody even had the chance. I think that's,

1209
01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:37.260
that's the thing, right? Like we can correct for

1210
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.780
that, we can go back and say, here is

1211
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:43.189
a voice that is underrepresented, but here's the voice

1212
01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:47.350
and like, let's rebuild um the tradition and say

1213
01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.050
that this voice has been underrepresented, but her voice

1214
01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.830
was destroyed. It never even got to the modern

1215
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.050
period. And I think that's the, um that's the

1216
01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:59.139
great tragedy here. Uh You know, we don't even

1217
01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:02.389
have the opportunity to go back and do that

1218
01:07:02.399 --> 01:07:05.520
work um because of the destruction done in the

1219
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:06.330
fifth century.

1220
01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:11.830
So I have one final question then in modern

1221
01:07:11.919 --> 01:07:17.659
times, in contemporary times, uh how do people look

1222
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.229
at, at high pressure? Because earlier you mentioned people

1223
01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:25.810
looking at her mostly as a symbol and not

1224
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:30.429
so much as the person she effectively was. So

1225
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:34.959
uh but there's a symbol of what exactly, what

1226
01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:39.070
does IPA symbolize for modern people.

1227
01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.979
Yeah, this is, this is one of the most

1228
01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:45.030
interesting things about um reading about hy patient. I

1229
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.699
mean, I for the, the book I went back

1230
01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.310
and I looked at all of these moments where

1231
01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.899
you see her from the 15th century to now.

1232
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:56.669
And because she is understood as a symbol of

1233
01:07:56.699 --> 01:08:00.780
um a pure and total commitment to rationality and

1234
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:06.280
intellectual pursuit, people put whatever they believe, the most

1235
01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:10.340
purest form of intellectual pursuit and, you know, commitment

1236
01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:13.350
should look like. So at various moments, you have

1237
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.419
her as, you know, a symbol of um absolute

1238
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.919
commitment to um stem, right? So Ara has her

1239
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.430
as like a, you know, Copernican, which is totally

1240
01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:26.770
made up. I mean, it's like ridiculous. Um HYPE

1241
01:08:27.049 --> 01:08:30.278
was a lifelong virgin, but you actually have somebody

1242
01:08:30.288 --> 01:08:33.519
who writes a thing about Apacia that commits her

1243
01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:40.528
to um a lifestyle of like uh hedonism and

1244
01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:42.608
like, you know, lots and lots and lots of

1245
01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.758
sexual partners which I would have looked at and

1246
01:08:44.769 --> 01:08:47.188
said, like, she would have been horrified that, that,

1247
01:08:47.198 --> 01:08:50.519
that anybody would think that's her legacy. Um But,

1248
01:08:50.528 --> 01:08:53.479
you know, you, you, it becomes something where whatever

1249
01:08:53.488 --> 01:08:58.430
ideas you particularly think are the purest, you can

1250
01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:01.450
make Hypatia a symbol of those ideas and you

1251
01:09:01.459 --> 01:09:06.180
can talk about irrationality and intolerance, destroying those ideas

1252
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:09.410
that you think ought to be preserved and supported.

1253
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:12.120
Um And hypia becomes a sort of stand in

1254
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:17.700
for, for that. Um And II, I think that's

1255
01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:20.350
um something we have to be very aware of

1256
01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:23.990
any time IP is introduced in a conversation. She

1257
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.100
is a symbol and it's a symbol that is

1258
01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:30.180
extremely resonant because the purity is absolute you know,

1259
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:33.640
this is somebody who truly lived according to a

1260
01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:37.640
set of principles that she understood very deeply. Um

1261
01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.859
She thought very hard about how those principles should

1262
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:43.220
guide her behavior. She behaved completely in accordance with,

1263
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:45.935
you know, the system that she developed and she

1264
01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:49.165
died because of it. And there's something really admirable

1265
01:09:49.174 --> 01:09:52.205
about a story like that, but there's also something

1266
01:09:52.214 --> 01:09:55.134
very malleable about a story like that. And you

1267
01:09:55.145 --> 01:09:58.285
can take that and take whatever principles you want

1268
01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:01.834
and use her as a metaphor to illustrate complete

1269
01:10:01.845 --> 01:10:04.875
commitment to whatever principles you think are most important.

1270
01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.484
Um And it's a very dangerous thing because in

1271
01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:10.645
a lot of those cases, I just would not

1272
01:10:10.654 --> 01:10:13.839
have agreed with you. The hypatia that you create

1273
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.439
was not a hypatia that ever existed. Um And

1274
01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:20.959
I think there is uh an obligation that we

1275
01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:23.149
have to the people in the past to be

1276
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.959
true to their memory. You know, if we can

1277
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.629
understand what somebody was about, we can't understand all

1278
01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.589
of what somebody was about. We can't understand all

1279
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.180
of what their concerns and ideas were. But if

1280
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:35.620
we can understand to some degree what they were

1281
01:10:35.629 --> 01:10:38.279
like and what was important to them, we should

1282
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:41.370
try to be true to, to those ideals. Um

1283
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.919
And putting her patient in a situation that she

1284
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.089
would not be at all comfortable with is I

1285
01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.240
think doing some measure of injustice to an actual

1286
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.520
person who actually did live actually did um feel

1287
01:10:54.529 --> 01:10:57.919
things and, you know, have emotions and have reactions

1288
01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.479
and feel tension and feel pressure and, you know,

1289
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.520
and made choices. We should be true to that

1290
01:11:03.529 --> 01:11:06.220
because we would want someone to do that for

1291
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.720
us too.

1292
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:10.839
Well, I would imagine that Taipei would not be

1293
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.220
alone when it comes to historical figures that are

1294
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:19.209
commonly who or whose ideas are commonly misrepresented.

1295
01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:20.930
Yes, absolutely.

1296
01:11:22.509 --> 01:11:26.319
OK. Great. So, the book is again, Hypatia, the

1297
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:29.660
life and legend of an ancient philosopher. And of

1298
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:31.609
course, I'm leaving a link to it in the

1299
01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.060
description of the interview and also links to our

1300
01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:38.790
two previous interviews and Doctor Watts just before we

1301
01:11:38.799 --> 01:11:41.660
go. Would you like to tell people again where

1302
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:44.069
they can find you and your work on the

1303
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.629
internet?

1304
01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.439
Sure. Uh I have a youtube channel that's called

1305
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.680
Eternal Decline of Rome. Um And we post on

1306
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:52.919
there, um all sorts of things about Rome and

1307
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.149
it is also the place where I, as I

1308
01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.430
say it, it's where I put my outtake. So

1309
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.939
I'm doing research and I find something that's interesting

1310
01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.779
that is never gonna make a book. Um You

1311
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.279
know, I'll do a little videos on those. So

1312
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:07.060
if you're interested in Roman stuff, big or small,

1313
01:12:07.069 --> 01:12:08.140
that's a good place to go.

1314
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:13.009
Great. So, Doctor Watts, thank you again, so much

1315
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.279
for taking the time to come on the show.

1316
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:17.890
And as I said, at the beginning, it's always

1317
01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:20.990
fun and a real pleasure to talk to you.

1318
01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.930
Absolutely. Well, I love it and I, I look

1319
01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.009
