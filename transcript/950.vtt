00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.730
Center. I'm your host as always Ricard Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.069
today I'm joined by Dr Zachary Garfield. He's assistant

4
00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.710
professor at Mohammed, the sixth Polytechnic University in the

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.270
Faculty of Governance, Economics and Social Sciences and co-director

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.530
of the Omo Valley Research project. His research program

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.360
focuses on relationships between individual behavioral strategies and group

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.950
dynamics in the context of cultural transitions. And today

9
00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:33.930
we're focusing mostly on leadership from an evolutionary perspective,

10
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:38.040
conflict resolution and other related topics. So Dr Garfield,

11
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.020
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to

12
00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.490
everyone.

13
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.500
Thank you, Ricardo. It's great to be here. I'm

14
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.319
looking forward to it.

15
00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:47.380
So perhaps let's start with a bit of uh

16
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:52.979
background here. So, um how do you approach leadership

17
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.549
from an evolutionary perspective? And in this case, particularly

18
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.060
from the perspective of evolutionary anthropology?

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.819
Yeah, that's a, that's a great place to start.

20
00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.459
So leadership studies is obviously this, this huge field,

21
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
you have a lot of work by scientists, economists,

22
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.540
um the whole field of management. Um And so

23
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.839
approaching it from an evolutionary perspective is a bit

24
00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:18.319
of a unique take. Uh And we attempt to

25
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.059
really integrate all these diverse findings, all these diverse

26
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.889
perspectives. Um Evolutionary anthropology as a sort of sub

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.339
discipline of anthropology is in and of itself very

28
00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.699
multifaceted and interdisciplinary. So we're trying to integrate theories

29
00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.059
and perspectives from across the social sciences within a

30
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.110
nat natural science framework. Um TAKING this comparative perspective,

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.540
this cross cultural perspective. And so when it comes

32
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.489
to thinking about leadership, um evolutionary anthropology thinks about

33
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.819
how leadership is really, what's its adaptive role, what's

34
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.379
the sort of cultural evolutionary dynamics underlying it? Um

35
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:58.089
We were thinking about how leadership processes vary across

36
00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.790
different types of communities based on their economic or

37
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.139
other cultural features. Um And it really suggests that

38
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.649
leadership is this product of human evolutionary history. So

39
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.449
we have some, some history that is, that is

40
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.529
driving the processes and the variation that we see

41
00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.690
today. Uh And so what, what we use and

42
00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.779
exhibit today as a species is based on this

43
00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.360
evolutionary history. And so this is really um we

44
00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.789
see leadership as a tool and it's a tool

45
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.380
that has an evolutionary history and it's a tool

46
00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.369
that's used to solve a particular problem. Uh And

47
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.399
in most cases, that problem is the problem of

48
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.600
group living or, or being in groups, existing in

49
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.300
groups. And it might seem kind of obvious to

50
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:43.350
us that, you know, we, we live in groups,

51
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.899
that's just how life goes for a social species

52
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.570
like us. Um And we humans like almost all

53
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.690
primates who are obligated to social life. So we

54
00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.759
can't survive or thrive in isolation. Um But actually

55
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.119
most mammals, about 70% of mammals do not live

56
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.539
in groups, presumably because the cost of group living

57
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.860
are, are so high. Um You know, in groups,

58
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.610
we more easily spread disease, we can more easily

59
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.089
get into conflicts over territory or mates for other

60
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.699
resources. Um We might consume resources at a higher

61
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.500
rate. And so if groups are going to persist,

62
00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.070
we need to overcome and offset these costs. And

63
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.020
so leadership is one way we can organize and

64
00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.320
resolve a lot of these costs of group living

65
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.429
and really, you know, gain the benefits from being

66
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.660
in a group because it can be very advantageous.

67
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.809
Uh And we're um you know, there are a

68
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.740
lot of ways being in a group can really

69
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.350
facilitate our individual survival in the production. We're obviously

70
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.169
we're better protected. Uh We have helpers nearby, we

71
00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.789
have an easier time finding mates and we can

72
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.720
work together to accomplish things that we couldn't on

73
00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.669
our own. So, effective leadership is a solution to

74
00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.600
this coordinate and motivation problem uh that groups face.

75
00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.289
And so um this perspective really emphasizes the importance

76
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.529
of understanding leadership in the context of human adaptability

77
00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.169
and survival and across different domains of social interaction

78
00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.210
across different ecological settings.

79
00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.800
Mhm But just to make one point clear because

80
00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.699
I think that is at a certain point there

81
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.329
you mentioned uh a cultural evolutionary perspective. So when

82
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.450
it comes to leadership, at least you in in

83
00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:26.380
your work approach, it not only from, let's say,

84
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.880
uh more genetic slash biological evolutionary perspective, but you

85
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.350
also include uh uh cultural evolutionary framework to, right.

86
00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:40.320
It's, I mean, it's not just about biology or

87
00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:44.190
perhaps some of the ways by which leadership might

88
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.130
have evolved as an adaptation and we'll get into

89
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.950
that later, but also about uh cultural evolutionary dynamics.

90
00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:54.660
Correct. Yes, definitely. And you know, even a lot

91
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.559
of the, the management field is kind of found

92
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.730
or come to this question, uh independent of any

93
00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:02.079
evolutionary perspective as well, the sort of question are

94
00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.250
leaders born or are leaders made. Um But clearly,

95
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.350
it's, it's an interaction and it's a product of,

96
00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:11.130
of both processes. So, you know, there are physiological

97
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.529
components that facilitates social influence. Um And, you know,

98
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.070
some of the heritability studies have found that leadership

99
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.220
traits, like basically every trait are heritable, you know,

100
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.500
maybe between 40 60%. Um But yes, I am

101
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.820
thinking about uh you know, physiological or psychological traits

102
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.209
that facilitates influence, which could include things like physical

103
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.980
formidability um or good decision making capacities. But also

104
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.609
it depends on the, the social and the cultural

105
00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:45.239
environment that individuals are embedded within. Um And so,

106
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.609
you know, who has uh knowledge or expertise within

107
00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.899
particular domains. Um And also the, the context in

108
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.809
which the problems individuals are trying to solve um

109
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.130
whether it has to do with intergroup conflict or

110
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.989
within group operation. Um If there is some sort

111
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.779
of um information that needs to be transmitted from

112
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.730
one generation to the next. And so, yeah, you

113
00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:09.010
really need, and this is another big benefit of

114
00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:12.559
taking this evolutionary anthropological perspective. You need to think

115
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.980
about both the cultural and the biological dynamics and

116
00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:18.820
how they're interrelated to really understand human leadership.

117
00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.500
Mhm So I, I mean, this might sound like

118
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.070
a sort of uh naive question, but I think

119
00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:28.269
it's an important one to address here. So when

120
00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.029
you look across different human societies and even if

121
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.750
you're looking into other animals as models, how do

122
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.010
you identify a leader? I mean, how do you

123
00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:45.109
say so that particular individual in that particular society

124
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.890
plays a role as a leader?

125
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.549
Yeah, that's an important point. And so operational leadership

126
00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:54.730
is really where we, we have to start. And

127
00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.769
so most of my colleagues and I think about

128
00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.000
leadership broadly and so we're defining leaders as individuals

129
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.609
who have some disproportionate influence within a, within a

130
00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:08.529
group. And that's pretty basic, pretty broad definition. What

131
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.070
we have to do then is to find the

132
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.200
group. And so when you define the group, then

133
00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:17.029
you can think about is influence completely uniform or

134
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.829
is there some variability? And if there's some variability,

135
00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.380
then you basically can identify individual leaders. And this

136
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.200
definition is very useful because it allows us to

137
00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:29.320
think about the psychological, the behavioral dimensions of leadership

138
00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:31.709
in a very broad way. So a lot of

139
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.220
my colleagues, maybe, for example, in, let's say, political

140
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.809
science, if you talk about leadership, they might be

141
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.230
thinking about people like heads of state. Um And

142
00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:44.019
that might be the sort of first uh uh

143
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:47.339
idea that many individuals have in thinking about leaders.

144
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.510
But from a behavioral perspective, from a psychological perspective,

145
00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.549
leadership is going on in so many different domains,

146
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:55.070
not just, you know, at, at the nation level

147
00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.429
or at the group level, but anytime you have

148
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.040
some individuals who are coming together and, and interacting

149
00:08:01.049 --> 00:08:05.630
together, there's likely to be variable social influence. And

150
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.859
so this allows us to think about any type

151
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:10.130
of group, um you know, a political group, a

152
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.369
work group, um a religious group or ritual group,

153
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.559
but also various social groups, you know, groups of

154
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.440
kids playing are probably going to exhibit some leadership

155
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.869
dynamics. Uh And families are probably going to exhibit

156
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.149
some, some very obvious leadership dynamics, but probably some

157
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.820
leadership dynamics that are central to human leadership interactions.

158
00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:30.899
And this is where a lot of our work

159
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.789
has, has gone to and thinking about how leadership

160
00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.919
within the family might be shaping or have shaped

161
00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:40.710
the evolutionary history of our leadership psychology. So, yeah,

162
00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:43.010
when we think about a group of individuals, we

163
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.520
can identify who has influence and we can do

164
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.340
this in a variety of ways it could be,

165
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.349
maybe based on some, some observational data it could

166
00:08:51.359 --> 00:08:53.750
be raised on, on peer ratings or there are

167
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.119
a variety of ways we could get at that.

168
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.619
Um But really in, in any group of individuals

169
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.599
we can think about who has influence and, and

170
00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:01.619
that then is how we would define leadership.

171
00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:07.809
Mhm. So what would be the main hypothesis out

172
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.169
there in the particular context of evolutionary anthropology? But

173
00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:15.320
if you want, you can expand to other disciplines

174
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.799
who also deal with leadership, who what that also

175
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:22.650
deal with leadership? Uh What are the main hypothesis

176
00:09:22.659 --> 00:09:26.840
there in terms of evolutionary models to explaining the

177
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:29.159
evolution of leadership?

178
00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:31.679
Well, there would be a few, I mean, I

179
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.000
think at the foundation, we can, we would predict

180
00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:38.770
that leadership is going to provide some benefits to

181
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.880
individuals and also to groups. And so the process

182
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.909
of leadership and followership should be beneficial for both

183
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.270
leaders and followers, at least on average over the

184
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.369
long term. Um Now it's a difficult task for

185
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.190
leaders to really optimize outcomes for many diverse followers.

186
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.250
So not every follower based on every leadership interaction

187
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.890
is going to going to benefit necessarily. Um BUT

188
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.049
over the long term, it should be a benefit

189
00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:07.270
for individuals and for groups. So that would be

190
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.750
one hypothesis that we would predict. Um WE could

191
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.719
also make some predictions about the traits of leaders.

192
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:15.799
Um YOU know, they should be individuals who are

193
00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.039
able to solve the problems that that particular leadership

194
00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:21.719
is, is trying to accomplish. So it, it might

195
00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:26.080
include um physical formidability. If, if that's important, it

196
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.440
might include intelligence, if that's important or special knowledge.

197
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.520
And we can also make some predictions about the

198
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.619
functions of leadership. So if leadership is this tool

199
00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:37.700
to solve the problem of the group living, we

200
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.919
can sort of retrofit and think about, you know,

201
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:41.820
what are the problems groups are going to face?

202
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.030
And obviously, that's going to include a lot of

203
00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:48.080
potential conflicts, uh coordinate problems. So we could predict

204
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.440
that leaders will be, you know, resolving conflicts and

205
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.679
trying to, to manage coordinations and so forth. So

206
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.130
those would be a few sort of key predictions

207
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.489
and what many of the theories have kind of

208
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.109
focused on?

209
00:10:57.849 --> 00:11:02.390
Mhm And is it that one hypothesis has more

210
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.469
support than the others or not?

211
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.820
Well, as I mentioned at the beginning of this

212
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.900
conversation, leadership is so diverse. So it really depends

213
00:11:12.909 --> 00:11:15.859
on the context in which you're, you're you're thinking

214
00:11:15.869 --> 00:11:19.280
about. So I wouldn't necessarily suggest that any hypothesis

215
00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:22.320
or theory has more support, but each sort of

216
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.510
partitioning leadership in a in some, in some way

217
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.320
and focusing on it in a, in a more

218
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.099
specific uh approach. Um So all the theories that

219
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:35.010
I've worked with have have some support um but

220
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.349
they all have shortcomings as well. And so a

221
00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:41.409
real challenge of the field is to uh integrate

222
00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:44.409
and sort of synthesize and, and reshape these theories

223
00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:47.219
as we get more and more empirical evidence. And

224
00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:49.270
so that's a problem that I think, you know,

225
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.409
just traditional management studies has faced and that all

226
00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:57.450
the disciplines face in that day discipline, the sort

227
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.989
of focus of a particular discipline constrains that maybe

228
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.299
the methodologies also the sort of the data they

229
00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:05.919
look at and we need many different diverse sorts

230
00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:09.299
of data to really understand human leadership if, if

231
00:12:09.309 --> 00:12:12.429
that's the goal. Um And so the evolutionary approach,

232
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.640
I think has been somewhat successful to this point,

233
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.500
there's still obviously much work to be done. Um

234
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.960
But we have begun to integrate fields, you know,

235
00:12:19.969 --> 00:12:23.669
insights from biology and political science and psychology and

236
00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:26.159
so forth. So I think all of these theories

237
00:12:26.169 --> 00:12:29.099
have important strengths but they don't have shortcomings. And

238
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.700
that's what some of my work has been focused

239
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.539
on, is trying to, trying to synthesize and trying

240
00:12:33.549 --> 00:12:37.080
to um make some contributions by connecting some dots.

241
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.880
And, and a lot of my colleagues in the

242
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.179
evolutionary social sciences are doing much of the same

243
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.440
thing.

244
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.460
Is there good enough evidence to support the idea

245
00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:51.479
that leadership might have evolved as an adaptation for

246
00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:54.309
an an evolutionary adaptation, of course.

247
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.950
Um Yeah, I think there are, there is so

248
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.390
well for one, we, we see leadership in every

249
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.309
human society um and many social animals, although they

250
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.169
are, you know, like I said before, they're a

251
00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:13.260
minority of social species. Um But a number of

252
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.739
biologists have suggested that all social species have some

253
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.750
sort of leadership that doesn't necessarily mean that it's

254
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.719
an adaptation. But it, it could be uh when

255
00:13:21.729 --> 00:13:24.340
it comes to human or maybe even like primates

256
00:13:24.349 --> 00:13:28.429
leadership. Uh There are some, some cues and some

257
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.250
hints that there might be some sort of adaptive

258
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.659
psychology underlying it. Uh For one is the sort

259
00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:37.859
of dominant style of leadership where individuals have influence

260
00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:41.820
based on capacities to instill fear in followers or

261
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.979
to coerce or control um individuals physically based on

262
00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:49.960
physical strength. Um Although it could also be social

263
00:13:49.969 --> 00:13:54.979
strength um based on social capacities, and we do

264
00:13:54.989 --> 00:13:57.849
see, you know, there's some, there's a variety of

265
00:13:57.859 --> 00:14:00.650
findings that suggest that, you know, even when physical

266
00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:04.659
formidability should be uh should not be relevant for

267
00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:07.979
leadership dynamics. We still see people like who are

268
00:14:07.989 --> 00:14:11.979
taller, having social influence or who are stronger um

269
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.989
being chosen or preferred as leaders. So that's a

270
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.619
hint that our psychology has this sort of uh

271
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.349
you know, this history of this primate heritage that's

272
00:14:22.359 --> 00:14:25.109
shaping who we prefer as leaders. Um So yeah,

273
00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:28.059
if you look at different heads of states, sometimes

274
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.020
they're, they're taller than, than, than the average height.

275
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.890
And you, you see a variety of, there's a

276
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.409
variety of studies that show that um physical formidability

277
00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:39.859
is preferred in certain contexts as well. And so

278
00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:42.070
that kind of suggests that, you know, we have

279
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.979
this, this, this evolutionary history where individuals who were

280
00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:49.700
physically formidable, were good leaders. That could be because

281
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.820
they were um coercive, it could be because they

282
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.239
were good at deterring free riders. It could be

283
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.549
because they were good in between group competition. Um

284
00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:01.080
But something about those traits were probably useful over

285
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.520
a long period of evolutionary history. And it seems

286
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.479
that our psychology today um also has those biases.

287
00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:09.469
So that's, that's a hint that there might be

288
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.539
a sort of adaptive leader follower psychology underlying a

289
00:15:13.609 --> 00:15:16.099
lot of the sort of sociopolitical processes that we

290
00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:16.950
exhibit today.

291
00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:20.539
So as you mentioned, at a certain point there,

292
00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:24.119
when people think about leadership and leaders, we tend

293
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.380
to think about heads of state, political leaders, reps

294
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.479
leaders in companies and so on. But as an

295
00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:35.940
anthropologist, of course, uh you're also interested in looking

296
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.750
across different uh human societies. And also I would

297
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.520
guess from an evolutionary perspective, the more traditional ones

298
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.469
are very important to look into because uh both

299
00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:51.869
the contemporary ones and the historical ones serve at

300
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.710
least to some extent as good models to the

301
00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:57.780
kinds of societies we might have evolved in during

302
00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:02.739
our evolutionary history. So how does the leadership look

303
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.799
like in more traditional societies? Like for example, hunter

304
00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:09.840
gatherers, horticulturalists and so on?

305
00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:14.349
Yeah. So we evolutionary anthropologists, you know, we do

306
00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:18.349
uh tend to focus on rural, more subsistence based

307
00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:22.070
societies. And yeah, like you pointed out they do

308
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.809
have many characteristics in common that we tend to

309
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.460
associate with our long term evolutionary history. Uh It's

310
00:16:28.469 --> 00:16:29.989
of course important to point out that, you know,

311
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.039
none of the ethnographically observed societies or contemporary hunter

312
00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:37.590
gatherers or small scale societies are, are perfect um

313
00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:41.114
replicas of our ancient evolutionary history. Uh But they

314
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:45.635
are oftentimes in some cases, they're, they're living relatively

315
00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:49.294
independent of state level influences. Um They may be

316
00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:51.955
less market integrated as well. And so that is

317
00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:54.775
a very unique uh circumstance and the circumstance we

318
00:16:54.784 --> 00:16:57.854
think does apply to our long evolutionary history. And

319
00:16:57.864 --> 00:17:00.434
it basically means that individuals have to, you know,

320
00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:04.665
the communities have to, you know, solve the problem

321
00:17:04.675 --> 00:17:07.074
of groups living on their own with different systems

322
00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:10.739
of leadership. And so you don't necessarily have uh

323
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:15.010
you know, state uh processes and influences, identifying or,

324
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.650
or mandating certain individuals be leaders or not. And

325
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.390
so that is a very unique opportunity. And so

326
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.530
then, yes, we can think about in more egalitarian

327
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.290
societies. What are the contexts of leadership? Now? It

328
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.310
tends to be a much more nuanced and context

329
00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:32.310
specific. And that's important to emphasize that even in

330
00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:35.560
all egalitarian societies, it seems that there are individuals

331
00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:38.400
who emerge as leaders in some context and they

332
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.209
may not have uh strong institutional control or course

333
00:17:42.219 --> 00:17:46.869
of authority. Um But leadership does emerge and it

334
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.349
also typically is not based on some inherited status

335
00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:54.040
or, or wealth distinctions, there's a strong cultural ethos

336
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.969
of sharing. Um And so leadership is really fluid

337
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.530
in these social contexts, it tends to be based

338
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.050
on individual skills. So, you know, what are your

339
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.060
individual capacities? How can you best benefit the group?

340
00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:09.890
How can you solve the problems the group is

341
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.109
facing? And then it's often linked to very specific

342
00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:17.130
context or needs. Um So it might depend on

343
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.270
um culturally valued skills uh or whatever the group

344
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.650
is particularly facing that in that exact context.

345
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.069
Mhm uh And so you've already mentioned that in

346
00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:32.160
an earlier question, but just to recap and also

347
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.430
for people to get a better understanding of how

348
00:18:34.439 --> 00:18:39.500
things work in these more egalitarian societies. So what

349
00:18:39.569 --> 00:18:44.625
exactly are the functions of leaders in these societies?

350
00:18:44.635 --> 00:18:47.505
Because people might just think, oh, I mean, if

351
00:18:47.515 --> 00:18:51.405
they are all cooperating, if the society is egalitarian,

352
00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:54.844
then what do they need leaders for?

353
00:18:54.854 --> 00:18:58.795
Exactly. Yeah, I think a key function that leaders

354
00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:02.324
in egalitarian societies are providing uh this really broad

355
00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:05.655
and, and probably universal is conflict resolution. Uh So

356
00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:08.400
you have lots of conflicts of interest. Uh And

357
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.900
this occurs at every level of social organization, you

358
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.359
know, you have conflicts within families, anyone who has

359
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:17.449
been in a family or has kids or has

360
00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:21.540
partners knows that conflicts can emerge, regardless of how

361
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.469
well integrated and cohesive. You are as a, as

362
00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.079
a sort of social unit and the same applies

363
00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:29.939
as you sort of scale up um in social

364
00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:32.930
groups, in ritual groups and, and then in larger

365
00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:36.380
scale kin groups, conflicts are just ubiquitous. And so

366
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.839
you need individuals who can solve conflicts. And doing

367
00:19:39.849 --> 00:19:42.910
so requires having a sort of a good model

368
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.680
of a mental model of all the individuals involved.

369
00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:47.939
You know, what is going to be uh an

370
00:19:47.949 --> 00:19:51.680
outcome that will most likely resolve this particular conflict.

371
00:19:51.689 --> 00:19:53.819
And that's very, it can be very difficult. It

372
00:19:53.829 --> 00:19:59.369
requires probably a lot of experience, knowledge, intelligence. Um

373
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.829
And it seems that this sort of demand for

374
00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:05.260
conflict resolution has probably driven a lot of the

375
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.099
other sort of status differentiation or hierarchies that we

376
00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:12.050
might see across the broadway societies. And we also

377
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.569
see this function of conflict resolution in different nonhuman

378
00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:18.130
species as well. So there's probably a long evolutionary

379
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.400
history of the need to resolve conflicts in social

380
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.280
groups. So I think that's a really broad function

381
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.689
that leaders are going to be serving. But then

382
00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:30.329
within different uh sort of social groups or economic

383
00:20:30.339 --> 00:20:32.209
groups, there's a lot of other functions as well.

384
00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:35.109
Um A key function from hunter gatherers has to

385
00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:38.199
do with subsistence. So um leading in, in hunting,

386
00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:41.369
for example, or in foraging, uh you know, individuals

387
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.000
have there's informational asymmetry in the group. This is

388
00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.520
also another another phenomenon that will drive leadership emergence.

389
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:54.150
So an individuals either know how to build tools

390
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.459
or know how to hunt or know where to

391
00:20:56.469 --> 00:20:59.180
go to forge or to find and very important

392
00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:02.489
resources that's going to lead to some sort of

393
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:06.170
leader follower dynamics. So yeah, things related to subsistence

394
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.420
and resolving conflicts, I think would be what I

395
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.000
would point to as being some of the most

396
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.660
critical domains and where leadership emerges in egalitarian societies.

397
00:21:14.349 --> 00:21:17.469
And so associated with that, what are then the

398
00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:21.510
kinds of uh psychological traits that people tend to

399
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.719
prefer in leaders uh in this particular case, in

400
00:21:24.729 --> 00:21:27.619
more traditional societies. And then we can also talk

401
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.849
about the more modern uh bigger scale societies. Of

402
00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:32.250
course.

403
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.640
Well, we have found um in both cross cultural

404
00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.319
studies and also in some of my field work.

405
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.680
Um THERE are a few traits that really seem

406
00:21:41.689 --> 00:21:44.770
to emerge as being preferred or at least common

407
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.479
across a broad range of social contexts. And so

408
00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:50.390
one key trait that tends to emerge across a

409
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.099
lot of different studies is having special knowledge or

410
00:21:53.109 --> 00:21:56.099
being intelligence now. And I'm kind of, I'm not

411
00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:57.969
gonna kind of put aside how to unpack the

412
00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:00.329
definition of intelligence and what that really means. Um

413
00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:01.750
But it seems that, you know, a lot of

414
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.369
it's a lot of individuals, a lot of societies

415
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.060
have some sort of endogenous cultural model that there

416
00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:10.979
are people who are good at making decisions that

417
00:22:10.989 --> 00:22:15.619
have special knowledge and that are effective at um

418
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.329
you know, managing conversations about different topics and coming

419
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:24.250
to solutions. So having this sort of cognitive capacity

420
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.780
is seems to be really important and associated with

421
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.969
leadership um being generous is also very important. So

422
00:22:30.979 --> 00:22:33.020
a lot of egalitarian societies, like I mentioned, have

423
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:37.199
this strong ethos of, of sharing and individuals who

424
00:22:37.209 --> 00:22:40.569
are, are very prosocial uh are, are valued and

425
00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:43.069
respected and that sort of is a sort of

426
00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:45.959
feedback loop that's going to also be associated with

427
00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:51.119
social influence. Um The leadership isn't necessarily just this,

428
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.150
you know, very altruistic behavior. So it can be

429
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.270
mutually beneficial. And there are a lot of important

430
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.130
theories to think about how, you know, leadership behavior

431
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.079
and fellowship outcomes are should be and are mutually

432
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:06.910
beneficial. But nonetheless, leaders are often also strategically nepotistic.

433
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.369
So while they are offering some some policies or

434
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.290
some outcomes for the group, they're able to shape

435
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.729
those outcomes still in some way that's going to

436
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.199
preferentially benefit themselves um or their kin. And so

437
00:23:21.209 --> 00:23:23.689
we have found evidence that leaders are tend to

438
00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:27.479
be strategically nepotistic across a wide variety of cultures.

439
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.859
And that makes sense, you know, you are paying

440
00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:32.530
some cost to offer this service to the group.

441
00:23:32.719 --> 00:23:36.000
Um It's, it's an opportunity cost, it can be,

442
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.079
it can be socially costly as well. And so

443
00:23:39.089 --> 00:23:42.140
individual leaders also need to reap some benefits uh

444
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.410
from those investments. And we also see, not only

445
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.079
do leaders get this sort of special status, often

446
00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:51.199
case is the case from prestige or other special

447
00:23:51.209 --> 00:23:54.890
positions, they're often getting a lot of material resources,

448
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.619
um, and other, other, other resources that sort of

449
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.939
offset the cost that they're, they're paying.

450
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.479
Mhm. By the way, in these more traditional societies,

451
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.510
do you find, do you usually find one single

452
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.290
leader or could there be multiple leaders? Like, I

453
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.949
don't know, I'm just guessing. But for example, a

454
00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:20.900
top hunter and a shaman, for example, could they

455
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.430
both be leaders because they have different competences or

456
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.000
not?

457
00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:29.510
Yes. That's exactly the case. So across a wide

458
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.550
range of the ethnographic record, you see these sort

459
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.579
of specialized leadership roles, um There tends to be

460
00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:38.670
sort of a maybe a community leader, a headman.

461
00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:41.640
Um There's often a term that's used or a

462
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.650
big man and this individual tends to be someone

463
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.260
who's sort of good at a lot of things

464
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.599
uh widely respected probably in their sort of prime

465
00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:52.910
of their sort of adult years. Um BUT not

466
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.329
necessarily an expert at any one particular thing. And

467
00:24:56.339 --> 00:24:58.560
they might be sort of a, a group representative.

468
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.400
Um You know, sort of the first among equals

469
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.489
is the phrase that's been used to apply to

470
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.319
this position. But then you might have a military

471
00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:09.780
specialist if there is intergroup conflict. Um You might

472
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.910
have a shaman as you mentioned, who is a

473
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.310
sort of repository of, of ritual knowledge and provides

474
00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:17.969
a lot of other supernatural functions for the group.

475
00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:21.939
Um And you could have other leaders in particular

476
00:25:21.949 --> 00:25:26.420
domains, you could have um sort of um religious

477
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.359
leaders or individuals who sort of are managing sort

478
00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:31.890
of cosmology that's passed on from one generation to

479
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.400
the next. And in many societies and particularly more

480
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.369
egalitarian um societies, you do have these being distinct

481
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.479
roles where individuals, you know, different individuals are exhibiting

482
00:25:43.489 --> 00:25:46.640
leadership in these different domains. Um And they can

483
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.920
be flexible too. So as maybe intergroup conflict um

484
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.449
rises and falls, let's say over a period of

485
00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:56.780
time, the individual who might be this military leader,

486
00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.660
their influence will rise and fall as well. So

487
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.219
the demands of the group will track um who

488
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.729
has influence and to what degree. Now, what I

489
00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:08.319
find really interesting is that at some point, um

490
00:26:08.329 --> 00:26:13.219
certain societies, these different roles tend to tend to

491
00:26:13.229 --> 00:26:16.300
coalesce. And so if you think about like um

492
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.920
Aztec and other uh early state level societies, you

493
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.630
have these leaders who are the supernatural leader, also

494
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.030
the, the military leader and the sort of sociopolitical

495
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.109
leader as well. And so I think that's kind

496
00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:33.650
of an open question right now is when and

497
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.250
how different individuals, these to be leaders and one

498
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.729
individual sort of monopolizes these different domains. And there's

499
00:26:42.739 --> 00:26:45.300
some interesting work on um you know how chiefdoms

500
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:50.750
emerge from a history of more, more hunter gatherer

501
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.270
or horticultural type uh sociopolitical dynamics. Because in chiefdoms,

502
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.430
you often do have um supernatural and economic and

503
00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:03.660
military force all being combined into a central role

504
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.849
and then then really limits followers ability to sort

505
00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:10.560
of push back and have some bargaining power with

506
00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:12.910
their leader. And that seems to be an important

507
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.739
dynamic that breaks a lot of the egalitarian dynamics

508
00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:20.719
and allows those, those leaders who re monopolize military,

509
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:26.560
supernatural and political force to have that coercive authority

510
00:27:26.989 --> 00:27:30.119
that is otherwise often absent when those are distinct

511
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.790
roles and when followers maintain a lot of, um,

512
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.939
yeah, a lot of, um, sort of what's called

513
00:27:35.949 --> 00:27:39.810
reverse dominance or the ability to really push back

514
00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:41.300
against aggressive leadership.

515
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:44.469
Mhm uh Actually, I was also going to ask

516
00:27:44.479 --> 00:27:47.660
you about that specifically. So earlier, for example, when

517
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.170
you also mentioned that leadership dynamics tend to be

518
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.819
very fluid in more egalitarian societies, that also includes

519
00:27:55.829 --> 00:28:01.375
the possibility of particular leaders being replaced or even

520
00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:04.785
people just getting rid of them if for some

521
00:28:04.795 --> 00:28:08.385
reason, they're, they're not fulfilling their role or they

522
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:12.005
try to curse or oppress people in their society,

523
00:28:12.084 --> 00:28:12.824
for example.

524
00:28:13.385 --> 00:28:15.494
Yes, exactly. And so, you know, a lot of

525
00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:18.864
egalitarian societies especially over, you know, across the ethnographic

526
00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:21.805
record have been highly mobile and they rely on

527
00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:25.630
a stochastic resource base. So, you know, whether it's

528
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.430
hunted game or seasonal forged foods, um they could,

529
00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:32.699
they move around a lot and that mobility gives

530
00:28:32.709 --> 00:28:34.969
them a lot of freedom. And so if there

531
00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.310
is a particular, you know, up and coming domineering

532
00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:40.699
leader who's really trying to, to push their weights

533
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.130
uh and getting a bit overboard individuals can break

534
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.829
off and they can, the groups can vision and

535
00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:50.060
people can sort of go their own way. Um

536
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.369
And yet in these more egalitarian societies, individuals have

537
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.530
a lot of mechanisms to push back against, against,

538
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.959
over really dominant leaders. And Christoph Bom, for example,

539
00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.459
has done a lot of work on this looking

540
00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:05.209
at uh actually evidence of what you would just

541
00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:08.430
what you could call assassinations effectively. Um If, if

542
00:29:08.439 --> 00:29:11.930
individuals are becoming too forceful, if not adhering to

543
00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:15.229
the sort of prosocial norms and offering benefits to

544
00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:18.810
followers, you know, people have access to, to spears

545
00:29:18.819 --> 00:29:21.630
to, to other weapons. Uh There's not a monopoly

546
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.750
on military sort of control. So, yeah, people can,

547
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.189
first of all usually push back. Uh OFTENTIMES they'll,

548
00:29:30.199 --> 00:29:33.369
you know, get elders involved, try and advise and

549
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.900
get this individual to, you know, exhibit leadership and,

550
00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:40.689
you know, offer the services of leadership. But in

551
00:29:40.699 --> 00:29:45.719
a more prosocial, culturally um consistent way, if that

552
00:29:45.729 --> 00:29:48.300
doesn't work, then they can be ostracized and be

553
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.959
punished, you know, worst case scenario, they can be

554
00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:54.709
uh deserted uh or in the extreme, they can

555
00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:59.550
be, yeah, they can be assassinated. Um So, yeah,

556
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.930
this really holds leaders in check. Um And that

557
00:30:02.939 --> 00:30:06.329
is a sort of important component of leadership in

558
00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:09.089
these more egalitarian societies, the ability to really push

559
00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:10.969
back and control leaders if need be.

560
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:16.479
Do we have a good idea of how societies

561
00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:22.189
go past the threshold where leadership can accumulate so

562
00:30:22.199 --> 00:30:26.520
much power that it can become more coercive and

563
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.520
hold more control over the re uh for example,

564
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.040
a particular leader over the rest of the individuals

565
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.829
of a particular society. Does that have anything to

566
00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:41.280
do with being able to accumulate more resources or

567
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.479
some other thing?

568
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:44.880
Well, I think it has to do partly with,

569
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.290
there's a few things going on but it has

570
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.010
to do partly with the resource control. So when

571
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:54.910
resources then can become monopolized, um property becomes demarcated

572
00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.140
territory, becomes more individually owned, this all helps facilitate.

573
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.319
Um YEAH, course of the emergence of coercive influence.

574
00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:08.739
Um And then another important component is intergroup interactions.

575
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:15.390
So when there's a strong threats of intergroup violence

576
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.689
or intergroup attacks, individuals tend to prefer a more

577
00:31:18.699 --> 00:31:21.050
aggressive leader. And so, you know, we can think

578
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.010
about variety of um outcomes in, in contemporary international

579
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.369
politics. When intergroup threat is high, people tend to

580
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.770
prefer a more dominant leader or they're willing to

581
00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:36.930
sacrifice certain individual liberties for the sake of being

582
00:31:36.939 --> 00:31:39.489
protected. Uh And we see that in across the

583
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.359
ethnographic record as well, um as intergroup violence may

584
00:31:43.369 --> 00:31:45.869
go up or down, uh individuals are willing to

585
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.989
relinquish some of that autonomy that is so essential

586
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.290
to egalitarian societies. Um So, yeah, I think economic

587
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.310
specialization or development or uh the ability to monopolize

588
00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:02.219
resources and intergroup threats, both play a role in

589
00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:05.709
this emergence of more social stratification of leadership.

590
00:32:06.819 --> 00:32:09.359
A and also you were mentioning there are more

591
00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:14.040
modern industrialized or post industrial societies, I guess. And

592
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.520
i it, it's also the case that when there's,

593
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.619
for example, social and economic instability, people tend to

594
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.250
prefer more authoritarian leaders, for example.

595
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.140
Right. Yeah, exactly. Um You know, we can think

596
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.680
about, you know, after 911 in the US, we

597
00:32:30.689 --> 00:32:33.619
have these shifts in policies that people are more

598
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.339
willing to subscribe to. You can sort of pick

599
00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:38.689
your favorite historical example. Um There, there are countless

600
00:32:38.719 --> 00:32:42.469
examples. And so um this shows that leadership is,

601
00:32:42.479 --> 00:32:44.670
is an important function and one of those functions

602
00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.359
is protection. Um But there's sort of a sort

603
00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:51.089
of a double sided coin here and that there's

604
00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:54.140
uh relinquishing autonomy for protection also then can lead

605
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.619
to, to costs as those, those those leaders then

606
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:02.579
have the ability to be more exploitative and um

607
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.719
channel more resources to their own outcomes. And there's

608
00:33:06.729 --> 00:33:10.010
less than sort of recourse for followers to keep

609
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.800
them in check.

610
00:33:11.329 --> 00:33:15.900
Mhm So at this point, can we say exactly

611
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:21.079
what are the universal and variable dimensions of leadership

612
00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:22.770
across societies?

613
00:33:23.959 --> 00:33:26.859
Yeah. So, you know, in my research, I've done

614
00:33:26.869 --> 00:33:29.219
a lot of cross cultural work where I I

615
00:33:29.229 --> 00:33:32.900
leverage the ethnographic record. So the ethnographic, the ethnographic

616
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.920
record is just the, the collection of documents that

617
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.719
anthropologists mostly have produced over the past maybe 200

618
00:33:39.729 --> 00:33:42.750
years or so. Um And so we can access

619
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.010
this record in a very user friendly way from

620
00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.060
a researcher perspective, we can review lots of different

621
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:53.280
paragraphs and texts about leadership, for example. And so

622
00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:57.939
I've built databases that uses this very diverse ethnographic

623
00:33:57.949 --> 00:34:01.839
record of, of human societies. And with my colleagues,

624
00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:04.310
we've, you know, coded these paragraphs and we do

625
00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:07.579
the statistics and um inner reliability and all these

626
00:34:07.589 --> 00:34:10.550
things. And so this allows us to investigate the

627
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.080
qualities of leaders, the functions. And we've also looked

628
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.168
at the costs and benefits of leadership for both

629
00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.050
leaders and followers. And so with this methodology, we

630
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.659
can offer some perspective on what traits seem to

631
00:34:22.668 --> 00:34:25.929
be universal, meaning they, they don't vary really across

632
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:29.530
different societies based on their subsistence strategy. So let's

633
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.489
say 100 Gers compared to agriculturists or based on

634
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.750
the sort of social context in which leadership is

635
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.958
emerging, maybe, for example, a political leader versus a

636
00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:42.010
kin group leader. Uh We also look at region,

637
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.770
you know, these societies are distributed around the globe.

638
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.149
And we also think about um leadership, gender. There's

639
00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.310
a big bias in the epigraphic record of leadership.

640
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.989
It's heavily male bias, but we nonetheless do have

641
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.449
some evidence on women's leadership. And when we've done

642
00:34:58.459 --> 00:34:59.729
all this, we found that there are a few

643
00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:02.419
traits that do seem to emerge as not really

644
00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:05.629
varying systematically along these lines. And so I've mentioned

645
00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:08.129
a few of these before, but the key is

646
00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:12.010
um having special knowledge, being intelligent, this is widespread

647
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:17.649
across societies across different contexts, uh resolving conflicts and

648
00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:20.760
providing various sort of social functions seems to be

649
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.060
the key job the leaders are doing. Um And

650
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.570
then, you know, leaders are often wealthy, which that

651
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.929
could be, that's obviously culturally determined what that wealth

652
00:35:30.939 --> 00:35:32.840
is. It's not necessarily, you know, having money in

653
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.629
the bank, but uh you know, whatever the material,

654
00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:39.149
uh whatever material wealth there is in the particular

655
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:43.199
community, leaders seem to be high on that. Um

656
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.159
And then they're really benefiting their family and they're

657
00:35:46.169 --> 00:35:48.500
being generous. So these are some of the qualities

658
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.399
that we see that um don't systematically vary across

659
00:35:52.409 --> 00:35:55.919
group type uh across the system type. Um ET

660
00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:57.649
cetera. Mhm

661
00:35:58.169 --> 00:36:01.399
So you mentioned one specific thing there that I

662
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:04.110
would like to ask you more about. So you

663
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.030
mentioned that uh in the ethnographic record, uh it

664
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.919
seems that uh the overwhelming evidence is that across

665
00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:16.919
most societies that we know of at least uh

666
00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:21.239
the leaders tend to be uh men. Uh But

667
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.080
uh I, I mean, uh be because this gets

668
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.350
us into very contentious discussions and questions, some of

669
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.419
them perhaps sometimes point to some sex or gender

670
00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:37.020
differences that might be or might not be e

671
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.419
evolved between men and women. So, um I, I

672
00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:45.780
mean, do you know if that really points to

673
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:52.770
some evolved biological differences between men and women or

674
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.120
not? Or that it could be more culture uh

675
00:36:56.129 --> 00:36:59.290
a more culturally based uh thing?

676
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.409
Yeah. So there's a lot we could unpack here

677
00:37:02.419 --> 00:37:05.360
and there's at least, you know, two important things

678
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.780
I would want to think about. Ok, first of

679
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:10.379
all, yes, you're exactly right. You know, we, when,

680
00:37:10.389 --> 00:37:14.870
when we talk about community level leaders or sort

681
00:37:14.879 --> 00:37:17.750
of like the political leader of a group, there

682
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.510
is a huge male bias and that seems to

683
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.840
be the case for, um, most societies, even including

684
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:29.570
highly egalitarian societies. Um, NOW, in egalitarian societies, there

685
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.870
is more gender equality, there is more opportunity for

686
00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:36.929
women to have sociopolitical influence. But nonetheless, it is

687
00:37:36.939 --> 00:37:39.370
still biased towards men. And there's been a number

688
00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:43.000
of cross cultural reports um and other empirical studies

689
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.419
that have kind of consistently found this this result.

690
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.219
Um However, if we go back to our conversations

691
00:37:50.229 --> 00:37:53.510
about how we define leadership, it depends on how

692
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.340
you define leadership to get this result. If you're

693
00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:00.870
talking about community level, sociopolitical leaders, that's one thing.

694
00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:04.449
Um But one thing that's, you know, my colleagues

695
00:38:04.459 --> 00:38:07.370
and I have tried to emphasize is that leadership

696
00:38:07.379 --> 00:38:11.459
is occurring within any social group. And so if

697
00:38:11.469 --> 00:38:13.820
we think about leadership within kin groups or within

698
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.889
families, um it might be the case that women

699
00:38:16.899 --> 00:38:20.239
are, are exhibiting much more leadership in these types

700
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.969
of social groups. So it could be that there's

701
00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:26.260
um specializations in leadership based on sort of a

702
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.199
division of labor or a gender or a sexual

703
00:38:29.209 --> 00:38:32.820
division. And that maybe men are offering more leadership

704
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.729
at the group level, uh this sort of sociopolitical,

705
00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:38.889
higher level and women are often offering more leadership

706
00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:42.010
uh within smaller groups or within family groups. That's

707
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.929
as a hypothesis. But I think there's some evidence

708
00:38:43.939 --> 00:38:46.760
that has led us to, to think this way.

709
00:38:47.389 --> 00:38:51.580
Um Yeah, so that's, that's one component. Another thing

710
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.550
would be that now, what are the traits of

711
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.629
leadership or is there some, you know, physiological or

712
00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:02.870
biological structure or, or, or traits driving men to

713
00:39:02.879 --> 00:39:07.100
be sociopolitical leaders or not? Well, I think what

714
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.129
the evidence has suggested in, in my work and

715
00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:10.760
some of the work of my colleagues is that

716
00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:13.010
it's, it's not so much that it's gender or

717
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.219
sex is a strong predictor of leadership, but it's

718
00:39:16.229 --> 00:39:20.850
that uh there seems to be specializations in, in

719
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.760
behaviors and traits and the way, the way that

720
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.560
men and women tend to um behave in an

721
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.179
economic system and that seems to be driving the

722
00:39:31.189 --> 00:39:33.620
differences that we see. So for example, when we

723
00:39:33.629 --> 00:39:37.590
consider gender or sex in these statistical models, we

724
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.679
often don't find that it's a strong predictor of

725
00:39:39.689 --> 00:39:43.229
differences in leadership. It seems more that there's a

726
00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:46.739
gender division, there's a sexual division of labor and

727
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.550
that tends to be associated with leadership at the

728
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.399
community level. Whereas women are more often engaging in,

729
00:39:53.409 --> 00:39:56.929
in household economic demands and working within smaller groups.

730
00:39:56.979 --> 00:39:59.820
There's a few men who then are offering more

731
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.629
of these leadership services at the group level. And

732
00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:04.939
so it seems to be that this bias in

733
00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:08.300
male leadership at the community level might just be

734
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.399
an effect or consequence of the sexual division of

735
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:13.909
labor, which might be related to a variety of

736
00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:17.639
other things. But, you know, economic demand, um childcare

737
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.179
and the way our societies are, are structured as

738
00:40:20.189 --> 00:40:22.679
a whole. So that wouldn't suggest that there's any

739
00:40:22.689 --> 00:40:26.600
that suggests that there isn't any, you know, physiological

740
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:30.409
or psychological differences that favor male or female leaders

741
00:40:30.419 --> 00:40:32.540
at the, at the community level. But there's a

742
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.899
variety of other economic and social structures that are

743
00:40:35.909 --> 00:40:38.520
facilitating that, that gender bias. Um

744
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.250
So I I have two more questions about that

745
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.570
specifically about uh differences in leadership between men and

746
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:52.729
women. So when we have women leaders uh do,

747
00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:56.669
do their traits tend to follow along the ones

748
00:40:56.679 --> 00:41:00.909
that characterize uh male leaders or do they tend

749
00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:03.370
to be slightly different?

750
00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:07.310
Well, it's, it depends, but there is some evidence

751
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.699
that it does tend to be slightly different. Um

752
00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:13.500
There's also some interesting work in interest in psychology

753
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.929
and management. There's been a lot of work on

754
00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:17.770
this. Uh So women leaders, but it depends on

755
00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.110
the study. So there's basically results aren't mixed. Um

756
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.090
But there is some evidence that women leaders do

757
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.379
tend to be more cooper and emphasize more participatory

758
00:41:27.389 --> 00:41:31.790
approaches. Um But this is obviously highly variable. Um

759
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.760
So basically, what I take from this literature is

760
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:40.260
that the sort of social and cultural context really

761
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.100
plays an important role. Um But it does seem

762
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.379
like that men are more prone to a certain

763
00:41:47.389 --> 00:41:51.260
style of leadership, particularly more aggressive leadership. Um Women

764
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.879
do tend to be more um yeah, participatory and

765
00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:56.270
inclusive. And you see some evidence of this even

766
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.050
among Children. Uh THERE'S not a lot of great

767
00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.909
work on social influence and leadership among Children. There

768
00:42:02.919 --> 00:42:05.510
is some uh and some of this work has

769
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.149
found that uh younger girls tend to be more

770
00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:10.800
prosocial or tend to use more of these mixed

771
00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:14.379
strategies of getting social influence. Whereas young boys tend

772
00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:18.629
to be a bit more uh coercive. Um So,

773
00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:21.600
yeah, there is some evidence that there's sort of

774
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.409
uh different profiles of leadership based on, based on

775
00:42:24.419 --> 00:42:27.110
gender. Um There's also a lot of work that

776
00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.979
suggests that women do tend to be more effective

777
00:42:29.989 --> 00:42:34.459
in conflict resolution in different cultural contexts. Um I've

778
00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:37.209
done some work among the chau, they're a relatively

779
00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:41.679
egalitarian border horticultural group. Uh And in the chau,

780
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.989
their cultural model is really that women are good

781
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.290
at resolving conflicts because uh men tend to be

782
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:51.389
more aggressive, tend to be more hothead. And if

783
00:42:51.399 --> 00:42:54.320
there's a conflict between men or between anyone and

784
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.399
a man gets involved to try and resolve it,

785
00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.439
he's gonna bring these, these biases and this sort

786
00:42:59.449 --> 00:43:03.100
of uh quick, quick temper and that's going to

787
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.969
escalate the conflict. Whereas women on the other hand,

788
00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:11.229
are more, more reserved or at least more, less

789
00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:15.610
quick to be aggressive and um that's going to

790
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.830
be more effective at resolving inter individual conflicts. So,

791
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.229
in, in the childhood cultural model, women are much

792
00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:25.510
more skilled at providing leadership services and conflict resolution.

793
00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:29.399
Um I I recently did a study on conflict

794
00:43:29.409 --> 00:43:33.219
resolution with my colleague, Luke Glowacki among Hammer, this

795
00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:37.260
is a rural paulist community, very patriarchal, so very

796
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.550
different than the chau it's not an egalitarian society.

797
00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:45.399
Uh It's, it's very socially stratified and biased towards

798
00:43:45.479 --> 00:43:50.649
um basically preferring um male influence and male ownership

799
00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:53.439
of property and so forth. But one interesting finding

800
00:43:53.449 --> 00:43:55.840
from the study was we found that in inter

801
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.750
individual conflicts between men and women, women often do

802
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.560
emerge as conflict mediators as well. So this is

803
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.679
sort of one signal that in this very patriarchal

804
00:44:06.689 --> 00:44:11.360
society where women have less sociopolitical influence and less

805
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:15.899
leadership opportunities uh offering conflict resolution services was an

806
00:44:15.909 --> 00:44:19.820
interesting opportunity for female leadership. And so this really

807
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:24.510
also suggest that conflict resolution is probably a uh

808
00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.290
an important feature of women's leadership across a wide

809
00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.290
range of societies and something we wanna look more

810
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:30.729
into.

811
00:44:31.709 --> 00:44:33.899
Great. By, by the way, let me just mention

812
00:44:33.909 --> 00:44:36.110
that I have an interview with Dr Luke Lo

813
00:44:36.409 --> 00:44:38.139
Ai on the show for people who might be

814
00:44:38.149 --> 00:44:42.530
interested. We talked about human warfare. Uh So one

815
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.810
more question before we move on to another topic

816
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.929
about uh men and women leaders. So uh do

817
00:44:48.939 --> 00:44:51.050
you think that it would be fair to say,

818
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:56.379
then that if uh human leadership and these differences

819
00:44:56.389 --> 00:44:59.939
between men and women is based or stems from

820
00:44:59.969 --> 00:45:03.669
the sexual division of labor and the sexual division

821
00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:05.810
of labor itself, at least as far as I

822
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.820
understand, it depends a lot on ecological factors, on

823
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:15.090
how the society is structured uh on economic factors

824
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.260
and even to some extent, sometimes uh cultural factors,

825
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:22.209
because of course, there's also uh gender roles and

826
00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:25.620
gender expectations. And we know even in our more

827
00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:29.360
modern industrialized societies, just over the past few decades,

828
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.050
that we have certain expectations as to the roles

829
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.120
that women could fulfill and now those have changed.

830
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.939
So, um I mean, is that all correct? And

831
00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:44.399
if so then would it be fair to say

832
00:45:44.409 --> 00:45:48.610
that? I mean, those sort of more uh simplistic

833
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.840
ideas that people sometimes have that men are more

834
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:58.270
fit to be leaders or to fulfill leadership roles

835
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.320
are just because they are biologically one way and

836
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.830
women biologically another way. And of course, I'm not

837
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.899
dismissing here evolved differences because that might also play

838
00:46:12.909 --> 00:46:16.340
a role in terms of the kinds of roles

839
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.820
that men and women tend to fulfill in different

840
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.100
societies. But that, that idea that it's just about

841
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.879
men and women being biologically different. And that would

842
00:46:27.889 --> 00:46:32.379
explain why supposedly men are better leaders is too

843
00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.500
simplistic.

844
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:38.239
Right. Well, yes, I think that is too simplistic.

845
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.959
I think you're, you're right in that, you know,

846
00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:43.800
the gender, gender divisions of labor are playing an

847
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.370
important role and those are like you said, it's

848
00:46:46.379 --> 00:46:50.750
gonna be culturally and economically constructed. So it's gonna

849
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.719
do, it's gonna vary greatly based on socio-economic context.

850
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.649
Um But I do think there, well, we have

851
00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:02.330
found widespread evidence of this sort of pushback effect

852
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.250
that has been documented by management scholars and comes,

853
00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.810
comes from psychology. This is the idea that when

854
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:13.689
women exhibit this more coercive uh uh as assertive

855
00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:18.280
leadership, they would otherwise be lauded as strong leadership.

856
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.810
If it was a man, uh tend to receive,

857
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.520
you know, pushback uh their, their bossy, you know,

858
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:28.520
a whole number of negative uh affect of labels,

859
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.770
get, get applied to women when they exhibit the

860
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.330
exact same leadership characteristics that would otherwise be respected

861
00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.409
if they were to be a man. And so

862
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:40.209
we might think that that is a product of

863
00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:43.830
um you know, a patriarchal system or the social

864
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.169
stratification system. But surprisingly, we found evidence of a

865
00:47:47.179 --> 00:47:50.169
similar effect even in the chau community I mentioned

866
00:47:50.179 --> 00:47:52.530
earlier, uh you know, in chau, it is very

867
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:55.489
gender egalitarian. Um WHEN you, if you talk to

868
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.120
people, you know, they, there's no evidence of really

869
00:47:58.129 --> 00:48:01.689
a male or female bias. Um But when we

870
00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:04.560
did the sort of systematic data collection on a

871
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.949
sample of individuals who were some were leaders, some

872
00:48:06.959 --> 00:48:09.409
are not, we collected data on a wide range

873
00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:13.629
of traits, including things like being respected, being prosocial,

874
00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:17.199
um being aggressive, getting in fights. We found that

875
00:48:17.399 --> 00:48:19.370
many of the men who were in these leadership

876
00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:23.860
positions were, were respected but were also feared and

877
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.000
also were known for getting invites. And it displayed

878
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.969
a lot of qualities of both, what we might

879
00:48:28.979 --> 00:48:34.030
call prestige and dominance. Um Their counterparts, their female

880
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.879
counterparts. On the other hand, uh the women were

881
00:48:36.889 --> 00:48:40.600
also intelligent and respected and prosocial and all these

882
00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:44.149
things, but they systematically were not, uh described as

883
00:48:44.159 --> 00:48:46.719
being feared or getting in fights. So it seemed

884
00:48:46.729 --> 00:48:49.010
that even among the chau, you know, the women

885
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.870
who were, um, a bit more aggressive were not

886
00:48:52.879 --> 00:48:54.919
in these elected leadership positions. So that was some

887
00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:58.010
evidence that there's a, a sort of pushback against

888
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.360
women when they're trying, when they use these more

889
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:06.939
assertive social strategies. Um Now what that means for,

890
00:49:06.949 --> 00:49:09.709
uh, our, our deep psychological biases. I, I'm, I'm

891
00:49:09.719 --> 00:49:12.719
less, I'm less sure. Um, BUT it does seem

892
00:49:12.729 --> 00:49:16.330
that there's, there's evidence that there's this sort of

893
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.590
pushback against this aggressive female leadership in, in different

894
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.330
contexts.

895
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.510
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's also very complicated

896
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.159
to disentangle all of these things, biology and culture.

897
00:49:29.169 --> 00:49:33.429
And, uh, I mean, we have these average evolved

898
00:49:33.439 --> 00:49:37.070
sex differences and, uh o of course, people in

899
00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.689
human societies also take notice of that and that's

900
00:49:40.699 --> 00:49:45.639
perhaps one of the places where uh gender stereotypes

901
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:49.419
stem from. But then, I mean, sometimes they get,

902
00:49:49.429 --> 00:49:52.409
uh they become part of culture and they get

903
00:49:52.419 --> 00:49:55.610
transmitted as such and then they can change over

904
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.649
time in different conditions. But it's really, I guess

905
00:49:59.659 --> 00:50:01.929
it would be fair to say that it's really

906
00:50:01.939 --> 00:50:07.850
hard to disentangle many times what's bio, what's more

907
00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.669
biologically based or more culturally based or, or contextually

908
00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:16.250
based, even based on, for example, ecological factors and

909
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:16.689
so on.

910
00:50:17.179 --> 00:50:20.760
Yes. Exactly. They're, they're very endogenous. They're strongly interrelated.

911
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:24.040
There's lots of interaction effects. And so yeah, disentangling

912
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.750
them is even um not even always necessarily the

913
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.080
best question to be asking too. We can think

914
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.239
about how and why different contexts are supporting different

915
00:50:32.419 --> 00:50:35.580
uh preferences in leadership and how that relates to

916
00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.620
gender. Um But yeah, it's very difficult to, to

917
00:50:38.629 --> 00:50:39.800
disentangle effectively.

918
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.949
And so another uh topic that I would like

919
00:50:43.959 --> 00:50:47.699
to explore with you here today is reputation and

920
00:50:47.709 --> 00:50:50.179
I guess that will also tie to some extent

921
00:50:50.189 --> 00:50:55.739
to leadership. So what is reputation in human societies?

922
00:50:56.679 --> 00:51:00.399
Yeah. So reputation, especially in egalitarian societies is sort

923
00:51:00.409 --> 00:51:03.159
of essential for becoming a leader. So it's, it

924
00:51:03.169 --> 00:51:05.669
was interesting to think about how that ties in

925
00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:11.179
the social influence. Um We typically define reputation as

926
00:51:11.189 --> 00:51:14.659
the sort of collective judgments of an individual social

927
00:51:14.669 --> 00:51:17.760
value um which is gonna be shaped by their

928
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:22.159
behavior, their achievements and their contributions to their communities.

929
00:51:22.169 --> 00:51:25.270
And so it's not just the measure of what

930
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.479
people think about an individual, but it's this sort

931
00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:32.540
of aggregation of beliefs and opinions and perceptions that

932
00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.719
define how an individual is viewed in terms of

933
00:51:34.729 --> 00:51:37.879
their, their character and their abilities and their overall

934
00:51:37.889 --> 00:51:41.169
worth to the group. Um So like we've been

935
00:51:41.179 --> 00:51:45.010
talking about it's gonna be very uh driven by

936
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.810
social context, cultural context. So at its core reputation

937
00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.050
reflects how an individual's actions are aligning with the

938
00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.129
cultural norms and values of their society. So it

939
00:51:57.139 --> 00:52:00.669
could include domains like your moral character, but also

940
00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:04.909
things like competence and social skills, specific talents. Um

941
00:52:04.919 --> 00:52:07.179
You know, maybe being an adept hunter or skilled

942
00:52:07.189 --> 00:52:10.659
mediator might be important domains of reputation, thinking about

943
00:52:10.669 --> 00:52:13.239
what we've talked about so far. Um But the

944
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.419
diversity in all these domains really highlights the fact

945
00:52:16.429 --> 00:52:20.560
that reputation isn't just a sort of monolithic construct,

946
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.879
but it, it really varies depending upon um, the

947
00:52:23.889 --> 00:52:26.439
cultural context and societal structure.

948
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.379
And are there different domains of reputation?

949
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.870
Yeah. So that's an interesting question. I think, I

950
00:52:35.879 --> 00:52:37.879
mean, the obvious answer is yes, you know, we

951
00:52:37.889 --> 00:52:40.340
can have domains and we can have reputation in

952
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:43.510
many different domains as, as a, as a parents,

953
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.800
as a sibling. Um, IN your line of work

954
00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:49.000
in your hobbies and so forth. Uh But I

955
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.760
think the, the interesting question though, is how many

956
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.169
domains are there or when are there more or

957
00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:57.949
when are there less domains? Um And this, we

958
00:52:57.959 --> 00:53:00.040
can think about personality in a, in a similar

959
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.209
way, for example, um Ricardo, you have a great

960
00:53:04.219 --> 00:53:08.699
reputation as being this exceptional podcast host. Um But

961
00:53:08.709 --> 00:53:12.879
to have that reputation, obviously, your social and economic

962
00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:16.020
context has to have podcasts. You can't have a

963
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.129
reputation as being a great podcast host if you

964
00:53:18.139 --> 00:53:22.939
don't have podcasts. And so the opportunity for reputation

965
00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:26.179
is partly driven by, you know, the socio-economic context

966
00:53:26.189 --> 00:53:30.489
in which you are embedded in. Um, AND there's

967
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.989
a, there's a line of thinking that suggests that

968
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.300
as sort of our social and political systems are

969
00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:42.679
expanding in um in their component parts that creates

970
00:53:42.689 --> 00:53:47.280
more opportunity for reputations um to be uh to,

971
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.429
to emerge. And so it can include a wide

972
00:53:49.439 --> 00:53:52.719
range of different sort of professional specializations, economic and

973
00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:55.879
political specializations and these are gonna be influenced and,

974
00:53:55.889 --> 00:53:57.879
and change over time. And so we can think

975
00:53:57.889 --> 00:54:00.870
about, we might think that, you know, the agricultural

976
00:54:00.879 --> 00:54:03.899
societies, for example, might value different qualities compared to

977
00:54:03.909 --> 00:54:07.560
hunter gatherer societies. Um SOCIETIES that engage in intergroup

978
00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:11.129
conflict might value different qualities than those which have

979
00:54:11.139 --> 00:54:15.310
less uh experience with intergroup conflict. So we really

980
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.040
think about how uh cultural ecology is shaping the

981
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:22.060
the range of reputations that are in a society.

982
00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.030
And if we go back to the the gender

983
00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.879
roles, we've been talking about um you know, different

984
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.699
individuals based on gender might have different tasks or

985
00:54:30.709 --> 00:54:33.199
different challenges that they need to meet and therefore

986
00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:38.540
have different reputation domains. Um A key reputation, a

987
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.590
key domain of reputation for women is often motherhood.

988
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.800
Um Sarah H he's talked a lot about this.

989
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:44.870
You see it in a lot of the work

990
00:54:44.879 --> 00:54:47.909
on female leadership. Um BEING a good mother, having

991
00:54:47.919 --> 00:54:51.669
successfully raised Children who, you know, have made it

992
00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:54.870
and sort of are successful members of the community

993
00:54:54.909 --> 00:54:57.790
that is usually a huge component of a female

994
00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.149
reputation in more subsistence based societies.

995
00:55:02.409 --> 00:55:06.110
And so if there are different domains of reputation

996
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:10.340
and some of those domains are highly specialized, particularly

997
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.669
in our more bigger scale societies. Uh Does that

998
00:55:14.679 --> 00:55:20.580
point to um uh a bigger number of human

999
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.959
hierarchies? I mean, what I mean by this is

1000
00:55:22.969 --> 00:55:26.679
so you can be, for example, the best footballer

1001
00:55:26.689 --> 00:55:30.429
in the world but but not the best at

1002
00:55:30.439 --> 00:55:33.649
uh anything else or you might be the richest

1003
00:55:33.659 --> 00:55:36.889
man in the world but not really competent in

1004
00:55:36.899 --> 00:55:40.320
this or that different domain or the more competent

1005
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:44.810
political leader, the more competent podcast or whatever. So

1006
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:47.709
uh I I mean, o of course, then you

1007
00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:51.919
might be the more competent uh something but not

1008
00:55:51.979 --> 00:55:54.850
uh the people at the top in terms of

1009
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.889
the socio-economic hierarchy. But what I'm trying to ask

1010
00:55:58.899 --> 00:56:03.909
you basically is uh does that uh complicate the

1011
00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:07.770
way we understand the hierarchy in human societies? Because

1012
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:11.360
I guess that there are different in issues of

1013
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:12.060
hierarchy,

1014
00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:15.399
right? Yeah, it very much does complicate. I think

1015
00:56:15.409 --> 00:56:17.060
the way we can think about hierarchy, you know,

1016
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:19.280
we want to, you know, just even from a

1017
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:22.300
scientific or empirical perspective, have sort of a, a

1018
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.350
linear hierarchy where we can sort of think about

1019
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.850
and maybe a two dimensional framework, individuals are high

1020
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.260
or low and some metric, maybe we want to

1021
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:32.280
call it status. Um But like you point out

1022
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.629
that there are many different niches and groups that

1023
00:56:35.639 --> 00:56:38.820
individuals are embedded in. So while it might be

1024
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:40.590
useful to think about sort of a, a sort

1025
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.090
of pyramid as the way to represent hierarchy, there's

1026
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.530
there's less space at the top. A few individuals

1027
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.959
are at the top. Most individuals are in the

1028
00:56:48.969 --> 00:56:52.250
middle, at the bottom. I think we can think

1029
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.850
about this in the maybe like a three dimensional

1030
00:56:55.139 --> 00:56:58.300
way where there are many different pyramids at many

1031
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:01.050
different axes. And like you pointed out, you might

1032
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.580
be high on one or a few but low

1033
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:07.209
on others. And we, I think we probably have

1034
00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:11.169
some sort of uh psychology helping us decide how

1035
00:57:11.179 --> 00:57:13.590
we are going to pursue status and what sort

1036
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.530
of reputations we are going to invest in pursuing.

1037
00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:18.449
We all have to make these decisions. Some are

1038
00:57:18.459 --> 00:57:22.840
probably made consciously so probably made subconsciously. But over

1039
00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:25.239
the course of our development, we're I think all

1040
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.360
searching for domains in which we can compete for

1041
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:30.399
status and where we can develop strong reputations. But

1042
00:57:30.409 --> 00:57:32.199
we have to make trade offs, you know, you

1043
00:57:32.209 --> 00:57:35.820
can pursue academics and that might, you know, trade

1044
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.399
off uh with you know, maybe your, your uh

1045
00:57:38.409 --> 00:57:41.870
physical fitness if you need to invest your time

1046
00:57:41.879 --> 00:57:45.360
in only one domain or another. Um And so

1047
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:48.620
we are embedded in all these different social groups

1048
00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:52.550
and we have higher and lower status and reputations

1049
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.149
and all these different domains. Um And then individuals

1050
00:57:55.159 --> 00:57:58.229
who are exceptionally high status tend to probably be

1051
00:57:58.239 --> 00:58:00.614
high on a few of them. Um And so,

1052
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.215
yeah, we can think about these different sort of

1053
00:58:02.225 --> 00:58:04.864
pyramids at all, these different axes in which we

1054
00:58:04.875 --> 00:58:07.145
are, we are constantly um embedded in our, in

1055
00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:09.114
our status is also dynamic. It's not just fixed

1056
00:58:09.125 --> 00:58:12.574
over time. So it is very complicated. And that's

1057
00:58:12.584 --> 00:58:14.754
uh yes, that's why it's a really interesting topic

1058
00:58:14.764 --> 00:58:15.215
to study.

1059
00:58:15.969 --> 00:58:19.429
And also to some extent, it provides you with

1060
00:58:19.439 --> 00:58:23.070
many different avenues for you to acquire a social

1061
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:27.260
reputation and be successful, right? Because you might be,

1062
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.989
I don't know, one of the best academics in

1063
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.870
your particular field, but not be necessarily rich or

1064
00:58:36.879 --> 00:58:42.310
have very high socio-economic status. But that's particularly from

1065
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.989
an evolutionary perspective, good enough because it grants you

1066
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.870
access to good enough social reputation to do good

1067
00:58:50.879 --> 00:58:54.870
enough resources and so on for you to be

1068
00:58:54.879 --> 00:59:00.080
evolutionarily successful and perhaps successful in some other regards.

1069
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.429
Right. Exactly. And I think it also has a

1070
00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:05.379
lot of implications in terms of how we structure

1071
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.310
our social networks. Um INDIVIDUALS who are, you know,

1072
00:59:09.429 --> 00:59:12.739
high in social status often are associated with other

1073
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.010
high status individuals, but it can be good to

1074
00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.479
have a diverse social network. Um So we all

1075
00:59:18.489 --> 00:59:19.919
kind of can understand this in your, in your

1076
00:59:19.929 --> 00:59:23.350
social groups or your um professional groups. It's going

1077
00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.219
to have a diversity of individuals who you can

1078
00:59:25.229 --> 00:59:28.540
rely on, who can help you buffer risk, who

1079
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.949
can help you solve problems. And so you want

1080
00:59:30.959 --> 00:59:33.550
to have a variety of, of high status individuals,

1081
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.570
but basically that, that diversity offers you a benefit

1082
00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:39.449
because it allows you to buffer different, different costs

1083
00:59:39.459 --> 00:59:40.439
that you're going to incur.

1084
00:59:40.969 --> 00:59:43.729
Mhm. And so to get into the last topic

1085
00:59:43.739 --> 00:59:46.889
of our conversation today, let's talk a little bit

1086
00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:50.379
more about conflict resolution. You've already mentioned that when

1087
00:59:50.389 --> 00:59:53.750
we talked about it being one of the functions

1088
00:59:53.879 --> 00:59:57.449
of leaders in smaller scale societies, but I guess

1089
00:59:57.459 --> 01:00:00.899
in our and also bigger scale society. So, but

1090
01:00:00.909 --> 01:00:05.479
what is conflict resolution more generally? And when we

1091
01:00:05.489 --> 01:00:09.800
talk about conflict resolution, what different kinds of conflict

1092
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:13.689
uh might we need to resolve in human societies?

1093
01:00:14.229 --> 01:00:17.969
Yeah, that's an interesting question. I mean, conflict resolution

1094
01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:21.419
is effectively, you know, these, these methods, these processes

1095
01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:25.709
that individuals use to facilitate the peaceful ending of

1096
01:00:25.719 --> 01:00:28.439
of some conflict. Um We can think about all

1097
01:00:28.449 --> 01:00:31.959
different types of conflict. You know, evolutionary scientists are

1098
01:00:31.969 --> 01:00:33.820
gonna be well aware of things like parent offspring

1099
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.449
conflict. Um So that shows that, you know, from

1100
01:00:37.459 --> 01:00:40.429
day one, there's conflict even not necessarily at a,

1101
01:00:40.439 --> 01:00:43.949
at a conscious level, but just uh uh preferences

1102
01:00:43.959 --> 01:00:50.050
for resources or for, for, for status. Um And

1103
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.100
then, yeah, we are gonna have conflicts with everyone.

1104
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:54.370
We're involved with our, our siblings, our parents, our

1105
01:00:54.379 --> 01:00:57.030
friends. Uh THIS involves this is gonna emerge when

1106
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.879
there's any sort of um disputes. Um And so

1107
01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:02.629
I think, yeah, effective conflict resolution is going to

1108
01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:06.719
involve some sort of process of negotiation or mediation

1109
01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:12.000
or dialogue um to achieve these mutual acceptable agreements.

1110
01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.639
Now, that's in a more informal context. Now, of

1111
01:01:15.649 --> 01:01:18.750
course, there's conflict resolution can also take the form

1112
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.709
of a police officer coming to a scene and,

1113
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:24.020
and you know, giving a ticket and saying, ok,

1114
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.070
you're at fault here, you're the one that ran

1115
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.479
the red lights in this traffic accident. So you

1116
01:01:29.489 --> 01:01:33.689
are going to have to, to pay for the

1117
01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:37.830
the solution. Um But on a more inter individual

1118
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.679
level, uh it's gonna be much more, more nuanced

1119
01:01:40.689 --> 01:01:43.659
and difficult and that's when this sort of conflict

1120
01:01:43.669 --> 01:01:46.439
resolution service is gonna become much more important to,

1121
01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:50.179
to solve these disputes. And that's going to involve

1122
01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:54.139
understanding the root cause of the conflict probably and

1123
01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:56.919
finding some way to resolve them that are acceptable

1124
01:01:56.929 --> 01:02:01.010
to both parties and in more smaller scale social

1125
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.500
context, which could be uh you know, it could

1126
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.389
be a small scale society or it could be

1127
01:02:05.399 --> 01:02:08.739
a smaller scale, you know, maybe professional group. It's

1128
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.560
very important that the individuals who are in conflict

1129
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.750
come back together and maintain some sort of social

1130
01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.949
relationship because uh our social groups, our, our communities,

1131
01:02:18.959 --> 01:02:22.550
our family groups are really dependent upon that interdependence.

1132
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.370
Um And if conflicts stand to break down that

1133
01:02:26.379 --> 01:02:29.399
interdependence, that's a problem, not just for the individuals

1134
01:02:29.409 --> 01:02:31.010
who are in conflict, but for everyone in that

1135
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.889
social group. And so it seems like leadership in

1136
01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:38.590
more smaller scale, more face to face context is

1137
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.739
really focused on, you're not identifying someone who is

1138
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.479
at fault and someone needs to pay a fine

1139
01:02:44.489 --> 01:02:46.290
or someone should say I'm sorry or something like

1140
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.840
that. But the key outcome is that the individuals

1141
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:53.090
who are in conflict uh resolve that conflict and

1142
01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:57.459
restore uh their die cooper operation and basically find

1143
01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:59.179
a way to move forward in a way that

1144
01:02:59.189 --> 01:03:01.969
is gonna allow them to be good cooper partners.

1145
01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.800
So that seems to be a sort of key

1146
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:08.040
outcome of conflict resolution uh either in small scale

1147
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:11.070
societies or in just more face to face social

1148
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.790
dynamics.

1149
01:03:12.469 --> 01:03:14.929
A and the very important thing here for people

1150
01:03:14.939 --> 01:03:18.449
to understand is that we are basically participating in

1151
01:03:18.459 --> 01:03:21.840
conflict resolution all the time. I mean, in our

1152
01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:27.409
own families, our own communities and other smaller scale

1153
01:03:27.419 --> 01:03:31.540
contexts, right? Because since we live now in societies

1154
01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:34.709
where we are used to having, for example, legal

1155
01:03:34.719 --> 01:03:38.250
systems in place and police to come um and

1156
01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.729
resolve particular kinds of conflicts. Because of course, we

1157
01:03:41.739 --> 01:03:45.489
don't know uh everyone around us and so we

1158
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.889
can't really keep everyone in check or negotiate with

1159
01:03:49.899 --> 01:03:52.850
them. So we need something like police in our

1160
01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.590
bigger scale societies. But it's something that is pretty

1161
01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.330
much ubiquitous across societies and across different social contexts.

1162
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.459
Right? And now it's important to point out too,

1163
01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:09.639
there are other, more, let's say institutional mechanisms to

1164
01:04:09.649 --> 01:04:12.270
resolve conflicts as well. Um And that can be

1165
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.699
really useful to sort of detach the conflict resolution

1166
01:04:16.709 --> 01:04:19.360
from a particular individual. So you have things like

1167
01:04:19.729 --> 01:04:23.489
um different sort of supernatural mechanisms to identify who

1168
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.169
is at fault and who's not even in hunter

1169
01:04:25.199 --> 01:04:27.699
gatherer societies. Um But then those become, I think

1170
01:04:27.709 --> 01:04:32.100
much more elaborated uh as societies become larger and

1171
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.979
have more interconnected parts. But so when we have

1172
01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:38.600
individuals resolving conflicts and when we have more institutional

1173
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:42.340
conflict resolution is an interesting question. But then the

1174
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.679
individuals who typically are able to offer these conflict

1175
01:04:45.689 --> 01:04:49.250
resolution services tend to be people who have good

1176
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.719
social supports, uh who are known for their decision

1177
01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:57.100
making capacities. Um I'm reanalyzing some of my data

1178
01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:00.590
from uh the child right now. And one thing

1179
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.510
I found is that a good predictor of conflict

1180
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.300
resolution is not necessarily being high on dominance or

1181
01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:11.060
high on prestige, these other important dimensions of leadership,

1182
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:15.040
it's really being high on good decision making capacities

1183
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:20.239
um and intelligence. So that suggests that conflict resolution

1184
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.479
is really, it's a, it's a difficult, it's a

1185
01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:27.020
cognitively demanding task to analyze a conflict, understand the

1186
01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:29.760
individuals involved and propose some outcome that's going to

1187
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.159
be mutually acceptable by both individuals. So it's not

1188
01:05:33.169 --> 01:05:35.500
so much just being respected or being feared, but

1189
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:39.830
it's this important sort of socio cognitive capacity that

1190
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.969
I think really allows conflict resolution by individuals to

1191
01:05:42.979 --> 01:05:43.659
be effective,

1192
01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:47.070
but for it to be effective, I mean, those

1193
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.000
threats have to be recognized in the particular individual

1194
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.570
that's going to play a role in conflict resolution

1195
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.280
by both parties that are part of the conflict,

1196
01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.500
right? I mean, it has to be someone that

1197
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:05.010
people know as those traits and that they respect

1198
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:08.159
as someone that will be able to play a

1199
01:06:08.169 --> 01:06:12.270
role in resolving that particular kind of conflict.

1200
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.800
Right. Exactly. And this is where reputation plays an

1201
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:19.689
important role in helping broadcast and identify individuals who

1202
01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:21.080
possess those capacities.

1203
01:06:21.719 --> 01:06:25.280
Mhm. Uh, AND so, uh, I mean, are there

1204
01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:30.679
different ways of resolving conflict and do they vary

1205
01:06:30.689 --> 01:06:32.159
across societies?

1206
01:06:33.169 --> 01:06:35.100
Um, YEAH, there are. So we kind of touch

1207
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.250
on this a little bit. Um, YOU know, it

1208
01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:41.790
can involve discussion. Um, THERE'S a lot of consensus

1209
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.719
decision making that happens a lot of conflict resolution

1210
01:06:45.739 --> 01:06:49.110
in 100 gatherers, but also in pastoralists based on

1211
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.179
my experiences and ethnography. I've read will involve a

1212
01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:56.260
sort of gathering of respected individuals for a council

1213
01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:00.739
and they'll resolve and that they'll discuss and debate

1214
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.889
and eventually come to some, they'll determine, you know,

1215
01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:06.570
who is at fault and what should happen. And,

1216
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.340
you know, maybe one individual who was in dispute

1217
01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.939
might not be super happy with the outcome, but

1218
01:07:15.159 --> 01:07:18.330
it's a consensus, it's a large number of individuals

1219
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.199
and there's really no choice but for them to

1220
01:07:20.209 --> 01:07:22.590
accept it. And so they basically have to accept

1221
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.090
that outcome to, to move forward and to basically,

1222
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.899
to continue to get along with other people in

1223
01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:30.909
their society. So it can be basically this system.

1224
01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:34.719
Um uh So that's kind of one way sort

1225
01:07:34.729 --> 01:07:37.679
of council of elders or council of respective individuals.

1226
01:07:37.689 --> 01:07:40.360
It can also be just one individual who might

1227
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.479
come, who might be around to resolve the conflict.

1228
01:07:43.489 --> 01:07:47.889
Uh Also, uh the individuals in conflict might nominate

1229
01:07:47.899 --> 01:07:51.159
or find an individual to advocate on their behalf,

1230
01:07:51.679 --> 01:07:53.620
that sort of evokes a sort of sort of

1231
01:07:53.629 --> 01:07:56.979
court of law type of system. Um But we

1232
01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:59.860
see this in the pastor, this context, individuals might

1233
01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:03.729
nominate their bond friend, which is someone who has

1234
01:08:03.739 --> 01:08:07.189
a special sort of formalized social connection to them.

1235
01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:11.620
And then these two individuals who are not unbiased

1236
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.489
because they are socially connected to the person in

1237
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.319
conflict but not directly involved in the conflict, they

1238
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:21.330
might then discuss and negotiate and, and find some

1239
01:08:21.339 --> 01:08:24.500
system of some resolution. So those are ways in

1240
01:08:24.509 --> 01:08:27.859
which individuals can resolve conflicts. Uh But we also

1241
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:32.160
talked about other more institutional systems as well. Uh

1242
01:08:32.339 --> 01:08:35.120
The oracle bones is one sort of famous example

1243
01:08:35.129 --> 01:08:38.759
from, from history from Ancient China, uh where there's

1244
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:41.669
these bones um that are, that are used in

1245
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.120
different um different contexts, sometimes they're burnt or, or

1246
01:08:45.129 --> 01:08:48.919
other, other processes are applied to them. And then

1247
01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:51.899
based on the, the cracks or the the patterns

1248
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:54.560
in the bones, someone who has expertise to do

1249
01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:58.649
this can sort of uh um sort of discern

1250
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.430
some outcome based on, based on the social context.

1251
01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:06.930
So it disassociates the decision from an individual and

1252
01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:08.899
it makes the individuals in conflict more sort of

1253
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:12.089
bound to accept the outcome. And we see other

1254
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.970
examples of this across a wide range of societies.

1255
01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.439
Um THE poison oracles. Another example from many hunter

1256
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:22.290
gatherer societies that typically involves uh either an individual

1257
01:09:22.299 --> 01:09:24.779
or a chicken taking some poison and then whether

1258
01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:27.169
it survives or dies is gonna be associated with

1259
01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.149
a particular outcome. And then that's going to be

1260
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.379
sort of uh the final word when it comes

1261
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:36.499
to this particular outcome. So these are sort of

1262
01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:40.068
social technologies that are going to, yeah, allow an

1263
01:09:40.078 --> 01:09:45.618
individual practitioner to intervene, who's ideally un unbiased and

1264
01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:48.457
to use this sort of external system that is

1265
01:09:48.548 --> 01:09:52.337
maybe relatively random or in many cases uh to

1266
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:56.709
then apply some outcome. And on the whole over

1267
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.359
time, it should hopefully resolve conflicts in the interests

1268
01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:02.189
of most individuals or at least allow individuals to

1269
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:06.279
come back and restore that cooper relationship and accept

1270
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:10.000
whatever some other uh outcome has has been.

1271
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.709
Mhm. And so I guess that you've already touched

1272
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.359
more or less directly on this point. But I

1273
01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:20.580
guess that one of the things that whenever people

1274
01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:24.080
are resolving conflicts appeal to or rely on a

1275
01:10:24.089 --> 01:10:27.910
lot would be social norms. Right. I mean, whether

1276
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:32.629
it's a particular individual, a high status individual with

1277
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.629
high reputation that comes in and tries to mediate

1278
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.509
the conflict resolution between both parties or if more

1279
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.560
or if it's of a collective decision and it's

1280
01:10:43.569 --> 01:10:47.640
basically the entire community coming together to resolve the

1281
01:10:47.649 --> 01:10:51.250
conflict. One of the things that people usually appeal

1282
01:10:51.259 --> 01:10:56.240
to is social norms, uh shared values. Uh uh

1283
01:10:56.250 --> 01:11:00.720
BECAUSE many times the way people resolve conflict is

1284
01:11:00.729 --> 01:11:07.189
trying to decide who among both parties perhaps violated

1285
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.439
a particular social norm or something like that.

1286
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:14.870
Right. Yes, exactly. So if there's a norm that

1287
01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:18.560
should identify, you know, who has transgressed that norm

1288
01:11:18.569 --> 01:11:22.479
and, and who is responsible, um because it gets

1289
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:25.089
muddy when there are, you know, one conflict may

1290
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.600
lead to another and then sort of disentangling fault

1291
01:11:27.609 --> 01:11:29.959
can be quite challenging. And so, and some of

1292
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:33.160
the reports I got collecting data from the hammer

1293
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:35.479
on conflict resolution. You know, there might be, you

1294
01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:40.540
know, someone didn't keep their fence quite secure, so

1295
01:11:40.549 --> 01:11:43.339
someone else's goat got in the field. Um BUT

1296
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:46.939
then maybe someone else like got upset at that

1297
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.339
person's goat and then maybe you violated some other

1298
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:52.930
social norm by you slandering them or saying things

1299
01:11:52.939 --> 01:11:55.080
they shouldn't have said. So then it just becomes

1300
01:11:55.089 --> 01:11:58.220
this, this mess. Um, BECAUSE there's lots of different,

1301
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.569
there's many different causes of fault all embedded in,

1302
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.794
in really what you, I think it was one

1303
01:12:02.805 --> 01:12:06.375
conflict. Um, AND so that's when someone who really,

1304
01:12:06.495 --> 01:12:11.654
uh, can peacefully and calmly understand both individuals perspectives

1305
01:12:11.665 --> 01:12:13.365
and the norms that may or may not have

1306
01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:16.194
been violated, uh, can help resolve that conflict. But,

1307
01:12:16.205 --> 01:12:19.865
yeah, you're exactly right that um conflicts are often

1308
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:22.535
driven by social norms because there are violations of

1309
01:12:22.544 --> 01:12:23.154
norms.

1310
01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:25.709
Yeah, I, I wanted to touch on that point

1311
01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.970
because, uh I mean, I guess that when it

1312
01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:31.410
comes to conflict resolution and als also many other

1313
01:12:31.419 --> 01:12:36.299
ways we establish relationships with other people, we most

1314
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:40.830
of the time rely on arguments on things that

1315
01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:45.069
are convincing to other people and in this particular

1316
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.180
case, social norm, shared values and so on, it

1317
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:50.470
tend to be very convincing.

1318
01:12:50.819 --> 01:12:54.740
Right. Yes, exactly. So, um this is the sort

1319
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.740
of the, the law of the land, so to

1320
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.740
speak in any particular community. What is it that

1321
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.270
we, we agree on? And, and those are really

1322
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:06.870
indisputable. Now, there's variation in interpretation and individuals are

1323
01:13:06.879 --> 01:13:10.520
trying to manipulate or, you know, use those norms

1324
01:13:10.529 --> 01:13:14.259
to their advantage. Uh But ultimately, there's a, something

1325
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:16.479
is a norm was violated or not or this

1326
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.220
is a norm or it isn't. And when it

1327
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:21.680
comes to that interpretation, it's typically relying on, you

1328
01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:24.540
know, the the body of the collective body of

1329
01:13:24.549 --> 01:13:26.540
knowledge, you know, in the, in this case, it's

1330
01:13:26.549 --> 01:13:29.680
usually elders who are the sort of authorities on

1331
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:32.879
what is the right way. Um And yeah, so

1332
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:34.680
by being a member of that social group, you're

1333
01:13:34.689 --> 01:13:39.200
sort of uh consenting to comply with a set

1334
01:13:39.209 --> 01:13:42.229
of social norms and those norms are often very

1335
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.299
difficult. And so some other work of mine is

1336
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:47.770
looking at how those norms are transmitted from one

1337
01:13:47.779 --> 01:13:50.100
generation to the next. And it seems like these,

1338
01:13:50.109 --> 01:13:52.979
you know, really opaque social norms for how to

1339
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:56.200
behave, you know, when should you defer to an

1340
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:58.250
elder or not or you know, what are the,

1341
01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:01.265
the sort of way to behave in very nuanced

1342
01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:05.095
situations? Um Even if you think about greetings, you

1343
01:14:05.104 --> 01:14:07.274
know, greetings are sometimes ambiguous and hard, you know,

1344
01:14:07.285 --> 01:14:09.225
should I, should I stand up and meet, talk

1345
01:14:09.234 --> 01:14:10.725
to this person? Should I shake your hand? Should

1346
01:14:10.734 --> 01:14:12.814
I not? Should we hug? Should we not? There's

1347
01:14:12.825 --> 01:14:14.464
a lot of variation in what is the, the

1348
01:14:14.475 --> 01:14:17.115
best in the appropriate social norm in a particular

1349
01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:20.845
context. And it seems like, you know, particular leaders

1350
01:14:20.854 --> 01:14:24.044
who are informed and have the opportunity and platform

1351
01:14:24.055 --> 01:14:27.145
to, to teach these norms are very active in

1352
01:14:27.154 --> 01:14:31.870
their teaching. And so in order to be successful

1353
01:14:31.879 --> 01:14:33.520
in a cultural context, you have to learn these

1354
01:14:33.529 --> 01:14:36.419
norms and learning these norms requires teaching. So I

1355
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.529
think this is a good example of how you

1356
01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:43.149
know, individual capacities and social norms uh work together

1357
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.089
in a sort of cultural evolutionary process to allow

1358
01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.759
individuals to exhibit proper behavior and, and be successful

1359
01:14:50.279 --> 01:14:51.720
in their social groups.

1360
01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.229
By the way, when it comes to leaders, and

1361
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.580
this will be my last question. Uh EARLIER, we've

1362
01:14:58.589 --> 01:15:01.370
talked about men and women, but there's perhaps one

1363
01:15:01.379 --> 01:15:04.580
more demographic aspect that I would like to ask

1364
01:15:04.589 --> 01:15:08.919
you about. So those leadership tend to correlate with

1365
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:13.180
age. So, I mean, I would imagine that people

1366
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:17.353
need enough time to become leaders to acquire the

1367
01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:21.373
necessary competences. Uh I mean, I, I if it's,

1368
01:15:21.382 --> 01:15:24.462
for example, becoming the best hunter, they need enough

1369
01:15:24.473 --> 01:15:27.632
time to develop their hunting skills if it's becoming

1370
01:15:27.652 --> 01:15:31.073
a sham and they need to acquire enough knowledge

1371
01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.453
to get to that point and so on. But

1372
01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.502
then I would imagine that after a certain point

1373
01:15:36.513 --> 01:15:39.893
as they get older, as they become, as they

1374
01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:44.096
become weaker, as their bodies become frail and as

1375
01:15:44.186 --> 01:15:49.545
they experience cognitive decline as well, that perhaps, uh

1376
01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:53.215
uh I mean, their leadership or the, uh they

1377
01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:56.855
would be put out of their leadership positions because

1378
01:15:56.866 --> 01:16:00.545
they are no longer respected as such or something

1379
01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.945
like that, right? I, I mean, is, is this

1380
01:16:02.956 --> 01:16:04.965
a correct view of things or?

1381
01:16:05.779 --> 01:16:07.959
Yeah, that's a, that's a great point. And so

1382
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:10.509
this kind of comes back to what are more

1383
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.930
of the, the variable dimensions of leadership because uh

1384
01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.439
age is one of the measures that we found

1385
01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:19.759
in the cross cultural data that was variable. And

1386
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:22.720
we did find that age was more associated with

1387
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:25.649
being a leader of kin groups. And that probably

1388
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.609
is because in kin groups, a lot of the

1389
01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.529
conflict resolute, a lot of the leadership is conflict

1390
01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.419
resolution. And it's these old individuals who really know

1391
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:37.540
everyone and understand different individuals, states of mind and

1392
01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:42.390
priorities um and biases and are able to offer

1393
01:16:42.399 --> 01:16:46.819
either counsel or advice, um resolve conflicts and so

1394
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.540
forth. So I think age plays an important role

1395
01:16:49.549 --> 01:16:52.819
in, in that ty that type of leadership. Um

1396
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.500
Yeah, I think you're right in that it requires

1397
01:16:55.509 --> 01:17:00.029
some expertise and there's a expertise and age and

1398
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.609
experience are endogenous. So whether it's experience or age,

1399
01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.109
it's obviously a little, it's obviously a mix of

1400
01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.180
both. Um So age is often playing a role

1401
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:10.979
in that regard. It requires time to develop the

1402
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:14.700
capacities and the knowledge. Um But yeah, it does

1403
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:17.100
decline, but it's interesting. It, it does and it

1404
01:17:17.109 --> 01:17:18.689
doesn't, I, I think of one example when I

1405
01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.839
was working with the chau, there was the the

1406
01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:25.819
oldest man. He was probably in his early nineties

1407
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:27.259
when I was doing some of my field work.

1408
01:17:27.339 --> 01:17:29.740
And he had been, you know, this legendary guy.

1409
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.689
He had been an amazing hunter when he was

1410
01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.410
younger. He had been captured by slave Raiders and

1411
01:17:34.419 --> 01:17:36.959
had escapes. Uh YOU know, all of his sons

1412
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:39.339
were the high set guys in the group and

1413
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.319
he was just revered and respected. He was obviously

1414
01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:44.669
way past his prime. He could barely see anymore.

1415
01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.330
You know, he walked around, he got around quite

1416
01:17:47.339 --> 01:17:48.680
well, but it still was a bit of a

1417
01:17:48.689 --> 01:17:52.399
challenge and he had these, this way of telling

1418
01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:55.160
stories that was really kind of comical and funny

1419
01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:57.580
because he was from a different generation, a different

1420
01:17:57.589 --> 01:18:00.600
era. And so the younger people really kind of

1421
01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.479
saw him in a kind of a comical way.

1422
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:04.799
Um But at the same time, they respected him.

1423
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:09.060
So he had certainly lost uh sort of social

1424
01:18:09.069 --> 01:18:12.830
influence. He wasn't involved in resolving conflicts or organizing

1425
01:18:12.959 --> 01:18:16.439
uh collective actions or really doing anything related to

1426
01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:20.140
leadership at all, even though let's say maybe 2030

1427
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:22.410
40 years ago, he would have been, but he

1428
01:18:22.419 --> 01:18:25.870
was still very respected. So I think he certainly

1429
01:18:25.879 --> 01:18:28.120
had lost some component of that sort of day

1430
01:18:28.129 --> 01:18:31.979
to day leadership behaviors, but he still had a

1431
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:35.779
very important place in society. So I think this

1432
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:37.689
kind of gets back to something we mentioned earlier

1433
01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.250
in that there are all these different sort of

1434
01:18:39.259 --> 01:18:42.689
axes of social status or social influence and some

1435
01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.459
are gonna decline and, and limit your ability to

1436
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.509
be a leader or have influence. Uh But some

1437
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.700
might be more robust. Uh AND they might just

1438
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:53.790
change over time. And there's a very important developmental

1439
01:18:53.799 --> 01:18:56.580
process of leadership which I think you, you touched

1440
01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:58.600
on quite well. Uh SOME of this based on

1441
01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.720
capacities and skills as those decline, that influence will

1442
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:04.890
decline as well. But other is based on social

1443
01:19:04.899 --> 01:19:07.459
value that, that may not decline. And um I

1444
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:10.100
think some of that is gonna be robust to

1445
01:19:10.109 --> 01:19:12.479
the, you know, the process of senescence while others

1446
01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:13.020
are not.

1447
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.850
Mhm. So would you like to tell us what

1448
01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:20.459
kind of things you're working on at the moment

1449
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.799
and you will be working on in the near

1450
01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:23.350
future?

1451
01:19:24.049 --> 01:19:27.509
Yeah, thanks. I mean, I'm working really heavily with

1452
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.830
my colleague, Lolo Ay, who we might talk about

1453
01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:33.350
earlier. We're collecting data from a number of different

1454
01:19:33.359 --> 01:19:37.589
pastoral communities in Southwest Ethiopia to really track how

1455
01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.430
transitions in their economic and political structures are related

1456
01:19:42.439 --> 01:19:45.399
to other features of their culture and health outcomes.

1457
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:47.189
So, we've been doing a lot of field work

1458
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.870
among among hammer communities and other pastoralist communities in

1459
01:19:50.879 --> 01:19:53.970
Southwest Ethiopia. Um And then sort of on a

1460
01:19:53.979 --> 01:19:56.689
more theoretical level. I'm working on a few different

1461
01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:01.439
ideas about how um teaching and leadership are co

1462
01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:05.870
evolving and driving human co-operation. That's one project. Another

1463
01:20:05.879 --> 01:20:08.399
project I'm working on is looking at the different

1464
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:11.950
forms of capital that are associated with leadership. Um

1465
01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:13.390
We've kind of touched on some of this, that's

1466
01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:17.049
something I'm working on now. And um we're also

1467
01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.270
working on a long term social networks project where

1468
01:20:20.279 --> 01:20:23.680
we're looking at between group, social relationships between group

1469
01:20:23.689 --> 01:20:27.500
friendships in the OMO Valley in Ethiopia and how

1470
01:20:27.509 --> 01:20:31.290
uh these relationships across cultural groups are being used

1471
01:20:31.299 --> 01:20:33.879
to buffer risk or not and sort of how

1472
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:37.009
they're, how they're driving uh the sort of social,

1473
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.750
social structures of different societies. Um So those are

1474
01:20:40.759 --> 01:20:42.020
a few things. I'm, I'm working on at the

1475
01:20:42.029 --> 01:20:42.370
moment

1476
01:20:43.319 --> 01:20:46.520
and if people are interested, where can they find

1477
01:20:46.529 --> 01:20:48.419
you when you work on the internet?

1478
01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.790
Yeah. So you can find me on math on

1479
01:20:51.799 --> 01:20:55.240
Twitter blue sky there. Um You can also check

1480
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:59.160
out our website uh the Omo Valley research project.org.

1481
01:20:59.509 --> 01:21:04.089
So in addition to doing our, our anthropological scientific

1482
01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.919
work, uh Luke and I are also heavily active

1483
01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:09.850
in a sort of a philanthropic component. So we're

1484
01:21:09.859 --> 01:21:13.240
always looking for um individual donations. We're able to

1485
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:16.930
use this money to support the education of rural

1486
01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:20.169
students. So there are a few individuals who have

1487
01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.680
come from these rural pastoralist villages who have finished

1488
01:21:22.689 --> 01:21:25.620
high school and they're often really interested in going

1489
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:29.459
to university to often study things like be science

1490
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:32.740
or, or medicine or business. Um You know, they

1491
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.899
want to help their communities in any way they

1492
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:38.250
can. And so we identify these individuals, we have

1493
01:21:38.259 --> 01:21:40.459
a grants committee. Um AND then we're able to

1494
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:43.870
fund their education. So that's been really rewarding and

1495
01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:46.160
exciting to, you know, see these kids who have

1496
01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:49.540
come from, you know, rural villages, uh kind of

1497
01:21:49.549 --> 01:21:52.439
progress and, and go through and pursue education. So,

1498
01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:54.879
yeah, you can check us out um on the

1499
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.700
oval research project.org to, to learn more about that.

1500
01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:00.459
So I will be leaving links to all of

1501
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:03.089
that in the description box of this interview. And

1502
01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.750
