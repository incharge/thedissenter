00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.059
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.960
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.500
today I'm joined by Doctor Ioanna Malinovsky. She's assistant

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.159
professor of Philosophy at Adam Mitski Aic University in

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.809
Posen Poland. The subject of her research is a

6
00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:20.434
broadly understood philosophy of science with particular emphasis on

7
00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:24.194
philosophy of medicine, philosophy of neuroscience and philosophy of

8
00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:28.385
psychology. She explores connections between these areas and questions

9
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:33.435
in bioethics, epistemology, ontology and methodology. Her current focus

10
00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:36.264
is on the conceptualization and the use of ethno

11
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:40.875
racial categories in medicine. So, Johanna, welcome to the

12
00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:42.455
show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.380
Thank you. Thank you for having me. It's a

14
00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:47.060
great pleasure for me to be here.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770
OK, great. So let's start reps to introduce the

16
00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:56.069
topic. Let me ask you what is cultural neuroscience

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.580
and what does it focus on exactly?

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.330
Mhm. So culture and neuroscience is a scientific program

19
00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.699
that was introduced at the beginning of uh 20th

20
00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.949
century by few researchers from the field field of

21
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:25.220
neuroscience. And the their um biggest concern was that

22
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.209
neuroscience usually treat culture to um in a, in

23
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.790
a too reductionist way. So it, it doesn't really

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.940
bother about it. They, they, that they treat human

25
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:43.040
beings and human brains in a sort of universal

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.819
stick way. And they started to insist that and

27
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.400
argue that um neuroscience should pay more attention to

28
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.610
the cultural factors uh that are involved into development

29
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.660
of human brain and human cognitive structures, as well

30
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:13.479
as the interaction between brain uh genes uh like

31
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.100
the, the, the, you know, epigenetic stuff and so

32
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.559
on and the environment of the individuals. So, mm

33
00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:29.009
cultural neuroscience in, in is interested in those interactions

34
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.559
between those three major uh categories or entities. However,

35
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:44.410
I really believe that this term cultural neuroscience is

36
00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.889
a bit um over it already because I want

37
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.529
to believe that most neuroscientists uh agree uh in,

38
00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:01.279
in 2020 23 that our brains are plastic and

39
00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.899
now that our genome is somehow plastic to a

40
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.529
point of course, and that we are uh bios,

41
00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.350
social beings like bios, social animals. So we are

42
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.809
developing uh and, and uh while we are doing

43
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.850
so we are somehow embedding the cultural uh the

44
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.339
cultural factors and the, the, the cultural aspects of

45
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.669
our living and the, the uh cultural, socio, cultural

46
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:37.759
aspects of our environment. So the, the culture and

47
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.210
the society is a part of our cognitive um

48
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.110
of our cognitive uh structure itself. Um And just

49
00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:55.199
to finish when the culture of the, the neuroscience

50
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.960
started to develop, there was this huge um the

51
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.800
biggest thing in neuroscience was probably the it was

52
00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:14.720
probably the whole bunch of researchers uh interested in

53
00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.760
evolutionary psychology and things like that. Right? So the

54
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.880
very, again, very universal perspective and very red reductionist

55
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.730
perspective uh when it comes to our minds and,

56
00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:33.929
and our functioning like epistemic and cognitive functioning. While

57
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.779
mm at the moment, we already know that many

58
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.559
of those ideas. For example, the the thing that

59
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.410
there is some kind of no normal brain and

60
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.130
that each brain should look the same. Uh And

61
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.950
that the same structures should be in the same

62
00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:58.220
place, have the same um should be um in

63
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.260
the same size and things like that. It is

64
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.260
uh it is some kind of idealization that is

65
00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:09.940
totally wrong because our, our brains are developing through

66
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.980
all our lives and the way how they are

67
00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:15.399
shaped depends on our experiences.

68
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.440
Mhm uh And so uh one of the topics

69
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.390
you've been interested in recently or in recent times

70
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:30.720
is uh race and ethno racial categories in medicine.

71
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.410
But in science more broadly, I guess. So what

72
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.079
do you think about the use of the category

73
00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.959
of race in science more generally before we get

74
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.290
into medicine itself? Do you think it is scientific

75
00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:47.359
at all to use it?

76
00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.459
So this, this is actually the problem with the

77
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.369
category of race and ethnicity, but especially with the

78
00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.329
category of race. Um So for me, it's uh

79
00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.950
the, the great analogy is to think about this

80
00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.989
this term, this notion of race as it was

81
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.549
some kind of mythical creature creature. So everyone knows

82
00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.390
something about it, but no one actually knows what

83
00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:20.880
it is. And this is what actually is happening

84
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.619
when people are talking about race and science, especially.

85
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.010
So, first of all, it is a highly contextual

86
00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:36.600
category. So each community is actually understanding and interpreting

87
00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:42.049
um it in their own way. Also each community

88
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:47.239
is actually trying to somehow set or negotiate their

89
00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.410
racial hierarchies in their own way. So even if

90
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.899
there are no people of color in that community,

91
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:03.470
they will probably try to somehow develop. Uh Norac

92
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:06.609
Karch is based on other criteria than just skin

93
00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:13.510
color. Uh TO be honest, uh racism itself uh

94
00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:18.019
may be interpreted as a phenomena that started uh

95
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:23.079
as something that was not only um associated with

96
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:28.329
the skin color, but also uh was based on

97
00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:32.929
criteria such as uh nationality or religion. Uh For

98
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.010
example, in the peninsula in like 15 century where

99
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.279
people who weren't, uh Catholics were uh yeah, were

100
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.179
sent off uh because they had a different religion

101
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.940
and they were treated differently. Also, there was this

102
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.160
uh at that time, the i the idea that

103
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.380
there might be some kind of pure blood and

104
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.260
the blood that isn't pure uh was developed and

105
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:06.779
it was also related to the religion at first.

106
00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:11.529
So, um so as I said, first of all,

107
00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:16.309
race means something else in different context in different

108
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.119
cultures, in different regions uh on our planet. And

109
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.839
this is the the first uh difficulty when we

110
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.980
talk about it because we all think that we

111
00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:31.959
are talking about the same phenomena, but maybe and

112
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.890
the same classifications. And this is especially important for

113
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:41.640
science because usually, mm when we think about about

114
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.809
race, we have this strong intuition that there are

115
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.729
some kind of universal classic racial classifications, right? Like

116
00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:54.400
uh people uh can be divided into blacks and

117
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:59.369
whites or yellows or um like this uh we

118
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.890
we think about this historical classifications that there are

119
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.559
like caucasians and, and negroids or something like that,

120
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.619
you know, uh while this is just one nara

121
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:17.789
one narration about class narration, classifications and in some

122
00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:22.000
other like some places, there are other classifications. Another

123
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.630
thing is that when thinking about race, we have

124
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:35.179
so many stereotypes that are related to racist beliefs

125
00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:41.539
in races that it's difficult to somehow abstract from

126
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:45.380
them. So even when research, like scientists are saying,

127
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.289
OK, race is just a social construct, there are

128
00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:56.869
no biological human races. Uh BIO um biologists agrees

129
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.909
like population biologists agrees that there are no human

130
00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.500
races. Um But maybe we will use some kind

131
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.359
of uh Norac classifications in, for example, in forensic

132
00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:12.630
anthropology, but this is not a a biological race.

133
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.609
We try to somehow relate, for example, to ancestry.

134
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:21.950
But then what this ancestry means to people, especially

135
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.750
if it's somehow related to this very universal uh

136
00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:31.119
classification that we all heard about like African Americans

137
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.640
and whites, for example, those are those two major

138
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.940
categories there, right? Or Asians as well. And um,

139
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.479
so if we, if we read a, a study

140
00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:49.909
and people are writing about someone's ancestry and this,

141
00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:54.869
um, this, this person or, or mm, those, those

142
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.960
reminds that are, that the researchers are trying to

143
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:04.690
identify, are assigned to African Americans or whites. So

144
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.150
what does it tell you even if they will

145
00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:12.109
later say that this is not a biological uh

146
00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:15.929
race, it is more of an ancestry and race

147
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.890
is just a social cultural project like a construct,

148
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.489
right? You will still probably have this feeling that

149
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.950
there is something biological there, right? And uh yeah,

150
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.510
and then finally, um we have this problem that

151
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.299
there are still some people who really believe in

152
00:11:38.309 --> 00:11:44.989
some kind of, so say the scientifical um theories

153
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.380
or some kind of very politically motivated. Uh So

154
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:59.150
the scientifical, hm hypothesis and beliefs about races and

155
00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:03.650
about some kind of differences between populations that are

156
00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:09.429
called races um that are used but for political

157
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.549
reasons and for ideological reasons to somehow shape our

158
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.789
social reality, right? So uh to, to divide people

159
00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:25.960
to, you know, we see there that, that kind

160
00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:34.390
of um racist narration about different uh cultures about

161
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.479
the different um nations that they are worse than

162
00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:41.750
others. Uh ESPECIALLY now when we have a war

163
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.820
in Ukraine uh which was strongly um related to

164
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:53.119
some kind of nationalist beliefs of presented uh in,

165
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.640
in Russia. At the same time, it was justified

166
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.190
by Russia that they are fighting nationalism, right? And

167
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.020
at the same time, there is like a huge

168
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.150
tension between Poland and Ukraine and all of those

169
00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:12.919
countries that have their own historical um issues that

170
00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:18.900
somehow rem that are somehow uh remaining racial or

171
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:26.429
racial uh Karch and racist narrations. So, um yeah,

172
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.229
there is a huge cause and a huge mess

173
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.109
and I really believe that um maybe there is

174
00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:40.340
a good think to, to start like revising this

175
00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:44.520
concept and you ask if I believe that the

176
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.429
race is a scientifical concept. So, so making, I

177
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.260
already said a lot but trying to somehow um

178
00:13:55.809 --> 00:14:00.229
briefly present my perspective here, I would say that

179
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.190
definitely it does not because as long as it

180
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.630
is not strictly or somehow precisely defined in each

181
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.520
study, we really don't know what that means in

182
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.280
particular. Um CON without the context especially, but even

183
00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:21.030
in a particular context, it is hard to uh

184
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:28.140
somehow infer what researchers or just uh normally people

185
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.750
think when they refer to race, what, what they

186
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:39.609
would like to refer to actually. Um And trying

187
00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:44.429
to like fro from the philosophical perspective, I really

188
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.059
do believe like, I, I find the arguments uh

189
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.429
very persuasive the, the arguments that are saying that

190
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.700
maybe there are no races and no um like

191
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:04.760
the category of race as some kind of empty,

192
00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:10.869
empty notion that is referring to many different phenomena.

193
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.080
At the same time, we could say that it

194
00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.489
is very like we, we can understand it in

195
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.929
a very pluralist way, right? Uh But maybe it

196
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.770
would be more precise to talk about racialized individuals

197
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:29.179
and racialized groups because only by changing the the

198
00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.880
language here to more process one to more contextual

199
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.309
one because we are rationalizing others or we are

200
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.070
racialized ourselves in some moment, right? And we can

201
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.909
change it. It's something that is a very dynamic

202
00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:49.760
and not that static category. Race. OK. I am

203
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.359
that race or he is this race. But what

204
00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:58.390
about the fact that people are changing their racial

205
00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:02.419
identities? For example, what about the fact that they

206
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:06.640
are, they would be uh identified as having a

207
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.119
different race just by changing their uh their country

208
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.130
or something like that because in that country there

209
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.210
is a different a classification recognized by government, for

210
00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:24.549
example. So yeah, II I would say that it

211
00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:30.280
is not the scientifical category and um and probably

212
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.700
uh racialization is a much better concept.

213
00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:38.630
Oh OK. So let's put a pin on that

214
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.940
racialization idea and also some of the other perhaps

215
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.820
consequences that it might have in the domain of

216
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.989
medicine. We'll come back to that later on. I

217
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.840
have a few other questions before we get to

218
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:56.330
that. But let me just ask you a follow

219
00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.010
up to what you said because there are many

220
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.119
points that you mentioned there and many things that

221
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.819
I could touch on. But let me just say

222
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:10.949
that, uh, so on my show, at least since

223
00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:16.510
2019, possibly 2020 I've had on the show, many

224
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:23.500
anthropologists, geneticists and biologists, uh, with whom I talked

225
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.310
about race, what were their ideas about race and

226
00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:30.400
so on. And I mean, at least people that

227
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:36.689
come from those three disciplines, anthropology, genetics and anthropology,

228
00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:40.380
genetics and biology that I think are the most,

229
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.890
the most well equipped to deal with these questions

230
00:17:43.944 --> 00:17:47.444
and not a single one said that he, that

231
00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:50.594
he or she fought that race at any sort

232
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:54.535
of scientific validity as a concept of it. So,

233
00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:56.834
but, but uh uh uh on the other hand,

234
00:17:56.844 --> 00:18:00.319
I guess that at least from uh let's say

235
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:05.310
sociological perspective, we have to take the category of

236
00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:10.199
race as a social construct or less seriously because

237
00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:15.290
it still has consequences in terms of social dynamics,

238
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.880
how people think about people from other racial groups

239
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.839
and me some medical consequences as we're going to

240
00:18:24.849 --> 00:18:27.739
talk about later. Right? So, but basically I'm asking

241
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:33.589
you if, even though scientifically speaking, I guess that

242
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:39.930
very, very few people take race seriously. Um IN

243
00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:45.280
terms of uh how uh people establish relationships in

244
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.979
our societies, how they think about other groups of

245
00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:52.130
people and, and how certain groups of people are

246
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.979
treated and so on. We should take it seriously.

247
00:18:56.989 --> 00:19:00.849
It has some sort of social reality to it.

248
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.849
Right.

249
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:09.430
Um So basically, yes, like making things short. Um

250
00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:13.719
Yes, of course. I didn't want to say that

251
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.729
there is nothing like, um, a construct that is,

252
00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:25.160
that is cultural, that can be ascribed to people

253
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.060
and just by doing so it can change, like,

254
00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:34.099
shape their lives, for example, and shape their attitudes

255
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.760
to themselves and to others. Of course. um IT,

256
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.040
it has a lot of meaning to be a

257
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:47.680
racialized person. Like we have those arac identities. Uh

258
00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:53.500
And I really believe that in a racist world,

259
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.060
each person has some kind of a racial identity,

260
00:19:57.069 --> 00:20:00.750
of course, each grown up uh uh person because

261
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.400
as a Children, we, we don't think about that

262
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.719
kind of uh factors like that kind of problems.

263
00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:15.020
Uh So ethno racial identities, as well as the

264
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:21.140
whole racist structure of our rewards. So uh sys

265
00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:26.219
systemic racism and interpersonal racism. So all the interactions

266
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:29.099
with other people who have some kind of racist,

267
00:20:29.109 --> 00:20:32.270
who probably have some kind of racist beliefs and

268
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.030
racist biases even if they don't want to because,

269
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.130
you know, uh we all believe in some kind

270
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:46.250
of stereotypes, for example, that, that, that govern our

271
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.670
uh way of thinking and, and behaviors, even if

272
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.489
we want to be 100% an anti racist and,

273
00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:02.060
and very inclusive. Yet there are some kind of

274
00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:11.739
um culturally acquired uh and embodied uh stereotypes and

275
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:17.609
beliefs that, that may somehow came up and affect

276
00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:19.660
us even if we don't know, even if we

277
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.560
don't want to. Uh So when the category of

278
00:21:23.569 --> 00:21:30.180
race is used in, for example, um sociology or

279
00:21:30.189 --> 00:21:34.609
uh I don't know, like some kind of cultural

280
00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:47.130
studies, it, it is meaningful and also it usually

281
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.109
refer to something that does exist that exists and

282
00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:57.810
that really is important to, to investigate, uh especially

283
00:21:57.819 --> 00:22:01.250
when it comes to cultural studies. It's very important

284
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:08.449
to learn how racism and racial hierarchies uh shape

285
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:14.339
human lives and all of that uh like the

286
00:22:14.349 --> 00:22:17.739
uh the social structure, the, the social reality of

287
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:25.880
our, of our world. But still, when we think

288
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:31.050
about them as about some kind of universal and

289
00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.030
objective categories, even if socially constructed, then we have

290
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.050
a problem because we are forgetting that cultures differ.

291
00:22:41.219 --> 00:22:46.170
And this is the problem. I believe that because

292
00:22:46.979 --> 00:22:54.290
we hear this very common uh in philosophy would

293
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.979
say like racial talk, um us, racial talk uh

294
00:22:58.989 --> 00:23:04.410
that is based on us ethno racial classification and

295
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.849
their uh social situ situation, social context and economical

296
00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:15.089
context and all the historical context and geographical context

297
00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:18.930
that shaped the, the situation in us and how

298
00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:26.859
race is interpreted there. Uh Then is it is

299
00:23:26.869 --> 00:23:32.459
very easy for, for older people to somehow um

300
00:23:34.829 --> 00:23:37.989
I don't know um somehow believe that this is

301
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:46.339
the, the way that like racial um divisions are

302
00:23:46.349 --> 00:23:52.140
shaped generally and that's it. But no it's not

303
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:57.780
true. Like this is a very complex uh problem

304
00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:04.819
that may uh differ different communities in a way

305
00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:08.400
that they shaped their uh as I already said,

306
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.630
um how they shape their admiration uh Karch or

307
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.959
uh you know, the privileges uh that are given

308
00:24:18.969 --> 00:24:22.930
to, to different populations and different uh diff different

309
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:27.199
members of the those populations. So the problem is

310
00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:31.150
not the concept itself may, maybe the problem is

311
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.589
not the concept itself but the fact that we

312
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.869
think about it in a very, so I I

313
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:45.750
will probably um mm sorry, iii I will say

314
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.750
the same thing as I said before. So we

315
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.869
think about it in a very static and very

316
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:59.449
uh universal and, and so essentialist way and when

317
00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:06.449
we think about essentialist category, but about the category

318
00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:09.910
in a socialist way and that category itself is

319
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:17.189
somehow associated with essentialist beliefs about the race, then

320
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.310
it's very easy to, to, you know, to, to

321
00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:24.800
skip from this point when we remember that we

322
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.589
are talking about very contextual and very processable and

323
00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:34.599
very dynamic and diverse category that is uh sour

324
00:25:35.859 --> 00:25:42.290
um uh category construct took place when we go

325
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.780
back to this uh essentialist belief that there are

326
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.050
some kind of biological races. And yeah, and the,

327
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.619
the way we talk about it about race, the,

328
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.760
the way how we describe it using certain words

329
00:26:02.219 --> 00:26:06.760
is is problematic and this is where uh racialization

330
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:13.500
probably works better again because it is a, it

331
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.949
is not uh like an object, you know, a,

332
00:26:17.959 --> 00:26:19.380
a verb, right?

333
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.369
No, I'm not very

334
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.140
familiar with English grammar. Sorry.

335
00:26:26.689 --> 00:26:28.719
So I think it's a noun, right?

336
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.750
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, um it is something

337
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.619
that is happening, someone can do that. It's not,

338
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:41.939
you know, this um this thing that is stable,

339
00:26:41.949 --> 00:26:44.170
that the thing, that thing that has some kind

340
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.689
of ideal uh shape or form that we can

341
00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:52.020
you know, check if, if you have this and

342
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.920
this and that then OK, you, you are uh

343
00:26:55.939 --> 00:26:58.209
white or black. OK. But, but

344
00:26:58.219 --> 00:27:01.829
then le let's get into that already since you're

345
00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:06.219
mentioning it again. So what does racialization mean exactly?

346
00:27:06.229 --> 00:27:10.349
And how does would it differ exactly from the

347
00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.810
concept of race?

348
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.380
So the concept of radicalization it it, of course,

349
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:23.250
it differs uh from philosopher to philosopher, from social

350
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.119
scientist to social scientist. So there are many different

351
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.949
definitions of radicalization. Um The way I understand it

352
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:42.250
is um is related to um very like evolutionary

353
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:50.270
uh interpretation of metaphysics I would say. So it

354
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.270
is it is uh related to um systems theory

355
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.349
and systems biology. And the the process all metaphysics

356
00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:06.349
that usually comes with this evolutionary biological, like this

357
00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:13.699
evolutionary metaphysics. And mhm And the fact that that

358
00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:21.209
kind of ontology which is multileveled or multisystem or

359
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:30.000
that may be understood as somehow emergent. So uh

360
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:38.040
not in that strictly reductionist way. Hm from that

361
00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:44.489
kind of perspective, radicalization is a process or um

362
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:51.199
many processes that produce or that lead to um

363
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:58.239
the belief that some person is uh representative of

364
00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.290
some kind of entity uh of, of some kind

365
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:08.119
of group. Mm That is a major biological entity

366
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.270
or human lineage uh that was formed due to

367
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.989
reproductive isolation. Uh And that the membership in this

368
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.930
group is transmitted through some kind of biological uh

369
00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:32.609
processes. So, um racialization, it's not about a question.

370
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.479
Are races real do races exist? But this this

371
00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:45.329
about question, do we believe that they exist? And

372
00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:49.829
do we believe that someone is uh has a

373
00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:53.760
race? Mhm And this is the the uh the

374
00:29:53.770 --> 00:30:00.430
most important difference between uh race and racialization from

375
00:30:00.439 --> 00:30:04.329
my point of view, of course. So we don't

376
00:30:04.339 --> 00:30:09.229
need to answer to this question anymore. Like am

377
00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:13.250
I talking about only cultural construct or maybe political

378
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.619
construct? Because we also have that kind of conversations

379
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.859
uh discussions and philosophy of race, right? So some

380
00:30:19.869 --> 00:30:22.680
people are saying this is only political construct and

381
00:30:22.689 --> 00:30:25.310
others are saying this is maybe only social and

382
00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:29.650
what are differences between political and social contract constructs

383
00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:32.709
when it comes to the development of the idea

384
00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:35.920
of race? So I don't need to answer to

385
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.780
this question because for me, what is important is

386
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:45.719
that some people identify with some construct, have those

387
00:30:45.729 --> 00:30:52.270
identities and what is the uh characterization of those

388
00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.939
identities? So here most important mo most important thing

389
00:30:57.949 --> 00:31:05.369
is that it is processable. So I may have

390
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.369
some kind of ad no racial identity in time.

391
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.369
T but in different contexts, I may change it

392
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:20.130
or I may uh experience different aspects of racialization

393
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:27.630
in different contexts. For example, I may feel like

394
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:34.949
a person which is racialized uh as white when

395
00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:39.729
I'm like a privileged white person when I am

396
00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:45.369
in my country, uh like in Poland. Uh AND

397
00:31:45.689 --> 00:31:51.459
when I help uh people who are so called

398
00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:56.479
illegal migrants in Poland. So, so people who are

399
00:31:56.489 --> 00:32:01.530
racialized as Muslims, for example, they may have even

400
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.410
light skin, but if they are racialized as Muslims,

401
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.030
they may face a lot of racism in Poland,

402
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.390
right? A lot of racist aggression uh and discrimination.

403
00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:18.010
So in that particular context, I may feel like

404
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:23.560
a very privileged person. But if I just go

405
00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:29.109
to Britain, for example, and I will move from

406
00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:32.739
Poland to Britain or to France or to other

407
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:41.540
country, which is um more um which, which racialize

408
00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:49.050
Eastern Europeans as that lower race historically. Uh Then

409
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.479
I may face some kind of some kind of

410
00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:57.010
a no racial aggression and discrimination and I may

411
00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:02.790
lose this white privilege. Uh This identity that makes

412
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:09.060
me uh more white. Uh W when I may

413
00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:12.150
help someone else in my country who is racialized,

414
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.290
right? I know that it sounds a bit chaotic

415
00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:23.540
but uh what I mean is we can change

416
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:29.660
those identities, but also we can this racial identity

417
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.560
and the, the fact that someone is somehow racialized,

418
00:33:34.569 --> 00:33:37.439
it has some kind of state of racialization, I

419
00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:42.800
would say uh it occurs on many different levels.

420
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:50.930
So you may be racialized on the level of

421
00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:57.160
enviro environment differently than racialized on the level of

422
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:06.650
some kind of a sociopolitical mm Processes that, mm

423
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.860
I don't know, recognize your uh identity uh as

424
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.370
something else because I don't know, some law changed

425
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.560
and now you are uh you are not a

426
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.560
white but you are now a Latina, right? That

427
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.080
kind of changes happened in our cultures a lot

428
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.080
of time, many times. Sorry. Um You may also

429
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:34.020
feel differently than how people see you, right? So

430
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.949
it's also something else to be rationalized by others

431
00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:41.458
and to have this admiration, identity and to rationalize

432
00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:47.418
yourself. Uh AND in all of those uh context

433
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.478
um that kind of um the, the the organization

434
00:34:55.489 --> 00:35:00.080
is something that is happening and is changing. So,

435
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.949
um I'm not sure if I explained it enough,

436
00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:09.330
but um this is something that from my point

437
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.929
of view uh really differs this static category of

438
00:35:13.939 --> 00:35:17.199
race and racialization. Hm.

439
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.500
Yeah. Yeah, I, I mean, I guess that uh

440
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:25.070
if we approach it on theologically, I guess that

441
00:35:25.129 --> 00:35:29.270
uh race would be more of like a based

442
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.929
on a substance ontology. There is a more essentialist

443
00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:39.580
category and racialization would be more based on uh

444
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.770
on a process on.

445
00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:46.469
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, you see, I, I

446
00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:48.330
do research on it but, but you explained it

447
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.699
better than me. It's, it's probably because my English

448
00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:53.739
and the fact that I was teaching all day,

449
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.810
all day long.

450
00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:57.879
No, no, no, no worries about that. But le

451
00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:00.129
let me ask you now. And do you think

452
00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:03.439
that the category or the concept, the concept of

453
00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:09.209
ethnicity fares any better scientifically speaking? Because, uh, I

454
00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:13.070
mean, as we'd raise, I guess that when people

455
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.459
use the term ethnicity, not necessarily in science specifically,

456
00:36:17.469 --> 00:36:23.879
but just in society, they might mean different things

457
00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:26.389
in different contexts, right?

458
00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:34.909
So ethnicity is another problematic term because again, people

459
00:36:34.919 --> 00:36:38.070
are using it in as a very different notions.

460
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.689
So before you said that most genetics, like all

461
00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:48.760
people who work on genetics, uh and biology generally

462
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:54.120
said that races, human races like biologically uh understood

463
00:36:54.129 --> 00:37:00.590
they don't exist. OK. But still race and ethnicity

464
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.689
are categories that are used in biomedical research and

465
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:09.570
genetic research, genomic research, et cetera, right? And similarly

466
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:15.800
ethnicity and this is the funniest thing. So basically

467
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.189
the the my first understanding of ethnicity is that

468
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:27.449
it is more uh it is more cultural phenomena

469
00:37:27.939 --> 00:37:35.469
because usually we talk about ethnicity um in relation

470
00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:43.560
to language, culture, nationality, right? However, it it's not

471
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:49.459
always happening, especially when we look more closely to

472
00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:55.389
to science. So OK, maybe in soc sociology or

473
00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:59.199
something like that, it would be understood as strictly

474
00:37:59.209 --> 00:38:03.110
social phenomena. But at the same time there was

475
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.189
this uh study in 2021 I suppose, or maybe

476
00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:13.419
22 uh about how the usage of uh categories

477
00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:19.610
such as race, ethnicity and ancestry changed or developed

478
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:26.520
in genetics. Um So in that study, it was

479
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:33.409
shown that researchers use ethnicity much more than race

480
00:38:33.419 --> 00:38:38.909
at the moment. Mm For many reasons, for example,

481
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:44.419
um they want to avoid this very controversial uh

482
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:48.629
category of race. So they prefer to uh use

483
00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:53.719
ethnicity instead of it or maybe they are from

484
00:38:53.729 --> 00:38:59.969
UK. So they uh the term ray or ethnicity

485
00:38:59.979 --> 00:39:05.459
is, is uh very often replaced with. Um uh

486
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:08.810
SO, so the term race is replaced with ethnicity

487
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:13.270
even if in their like uh caucus, right? So,

488
00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.070
so they don't gather racial data, they just gather

489
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:24.570
and, and use eth ethnicity data. Um And uh

490
00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:32.159
in such a situation, we have this, those re

491
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:38.629
those studies are in biomedicine, like in genetics, genomics

492
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:47.790
that still recognize uh hm population like uh differences

493
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.600
between populations on the basis of a, a category

494
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:56.570
of race and ethnicity or only ethnicity even. So,

495
00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:04.100
then if ethnicity has something in common with some

496
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:11.500
kind of biological differences between people. And additionally, and

497
00:40:12.709 --> 00:40:18.429
it was also um researched like it, it, I

498
00:40:18.439 --> 00:40:21.439
even described this um such situations in one of

499
00:40:21.449 --> 00:40:27.719
my papers. I if additionally, we apply uh th

500
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:32.000
that uh us racial talk to, to that to

501
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:37.179
those uh uh this term ethnicity. So if we

502
00:40:37.189 --> 00:40:43.219
will understand ethnicity as some kind of proxy for

503
00:40:43.229 --> 00:40:47.179
racial classifications. Then there is a huge mess here

504
00:40:47.189 --> 00:40:54.739
because instead of trying to the biologist or the

505
00:40:54.750 --> 00:41:01.610
centralized race, we are doing completely opposite. So we

506
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.520
biologist and centralize ethnicity. There is a lot of

507
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:14.040
papers where you can find information about um genetical

508
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.010
differences, like in some kind of um some kind

509
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:23.110
of gene gene polymorphisms, for example, uh between populations

510
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.179
and those populations are uh described uh with the

511
00:41:30.189 --> 00:41:36.610
relation to us uh Arac classifications. So as African

512
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:44.760
Americans, white, um native Americans, uh Asians, etcetera. So

513
00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:50.139
what then what that kind of ethnicity mean? Of

514
00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:52.860
course, in other studies, it would be much more

515
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.850
precise because for example, they will use more demograph

516
00:41:57.989 --> 00:42:01.909
understanding of ethnicity. So it will be uh closely

517
00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:08.260
related to people, people's uh place of living or

518
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:12.489
something like that. And they would say not whites,

519
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.209
but for example, poles uh instead of whites. Mhm.

520
00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.030
Um Yet still, what does it mean when it

521
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.179
comes to my genes? Right? That I, when, when

522
00:42:28.189 --> 00:42:30.780
they call me just a poll we also have

523
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:36.120
now I I saw a discussion uh about a

524
00:42:36.129 --> 00:42:41.050
new proposition for FDA at no racial classification in

525
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.610
USA uh or O MD at no racial classifications

526
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.600
like some changes and revisions and that they are

527
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:54.679
proposing and if you answer the questions uh uh

528
00:42:54.689 --> 00:42:59.699
to in their mm in their new forms, then

529
00:42:59.709 --> 00:43:02.000
you, for example, if you are white so called

530
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.639
white, then you can choose, for example, white pole

531
00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.909
or uh I don't know white German. But if

532
00:43:10.919 --> 00:43:13.679
you are pole and not white, there is no

533
00:43:13.689 --> 00:43:16.419
category for you. But I know that there are

534
00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:19.469
some poles that are not white like they have,

535
00:43:19.479 --> 00:43:21.969
they don't have a white skin, right? So, yeah,

536
00:43:21.979 --> 00:43:28.149
so this is another problem here. Uh Yeah. Yeah.

537
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:34.139
So perhaps let me ask you a somewhat broader

538
00:43:34.149 --> 00:43:38.719
question because uh we've already seen here and also

539
00:43:38.729 --> 00:43:42.179
again mentioning some other interviews that I've had over

540
00:43:42.189 --> 00:43:45.909
the course of the last few years with geneticists,

541
00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:49.090
anthropologists and biologists on the show and people can

542
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.260
go back and check them out. Some of them

543
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.699
have even raised on the title so you can,

544
00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:59.350
you can get there easily. Um uh There are

545
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:04.379
so race and ethnicity are very messy concepts and

546
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.570
when people try to study, for example, differences between

547
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.879
human populations, sometimes they use those concepts, other times

548
00:44:15.889 --> 00:44:19.030
they do not use them. But still do, do

549
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.030
you think that there might be some issues associated

550
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.909
with assuming differences between human populations when studying them?

551
00:44:30.169 --> 00:44:34.370
I mean, expecting there to be uh differences between

552
00:44:34.379 --> 00:44:35.389
human population.

553
00:44:36.729 --> 00:44:39.669
I believe that there are human differences between human

554
00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:45.909
populations. Um LIKE our populations are very variant, like

555
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:53.270
there is a huge variety between people, right? Um

556
00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.229
And of course, it would be silly to say

557
00:44:56.239 --> 00:45:02.449
that there are no genetical differences between people or

558
00:45:02.459 --> 00:45:04.850
there are no I don't know, like other differences

559
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:10.840
between people. There are those differences but race and

560
00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:15.669
ethnicity are a very shitty categories to, to be

561
00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:21.659
used to, to study those differences. Um For all

562
00:45:21.669 --> 00:45:25.820
of those reasons I talked about also like usually

563
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:30.060
race and ethnicity, like ethno racial data in, in,

564
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:38.219
in us are gathered um by uh information about

565
00:45:38.229 --> 00:45:43.260
people's um self ID, ID, identification, right? So their

566
00:45:43.399 --> 00:45:51.500
self identity, but what does self identity, what, what

567
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:55.550
it tells us about their genes? It is difficult

568
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.649
to say, right? And again, what the fact that

569
00:45:58.659 --> 00:46:03.270
I live in Poland. Uh So I am appalled,

570
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:11.600
say about my genes, something probably. But we know

571
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.729
that our researchers uh our research, our studies, our

572
00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:18.820
science may can be and should be much more

573
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:24.090
precise. And this is something that may sound funny.

574
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.739
But um like in this part, like in my

575
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.909
part of the world. So, so Eastern Europe, uh

576
00:46:31.949 --> 00:46:35.419
people moved a lot because for example, because of

577
00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:37.889
World War Two, right? And a part of my

578
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:42.000
family is uh from via, so a place in

579
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:46.879
uh contemporary Ukraine and they had to, most of

580
00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:50.570
them were killed uh by nationalists and some of

581
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:55.989
them escaped to Poland, other parts from my family,

582
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.449
like other ancestors uh in my family could come

583
00:47:01.459 --> 00:47:05.830
from some kind of um eee even more, more

584
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.040
from the west and from east. Sorry. So uh

585
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:17.040
my genetic, my, my DNA and my genome is

586
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.080
a bit mixed. So why it matters and why,

587
00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:27.050
why I am talking about it first. Um Because

588
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:32.439
for example, when I was visiting a surgeon um

589
00:47:32.639 --> 00:47:36.449
because I had some problems with my jaw. He

590
00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:41.110
said that I have a mongoloid skull. Uh AND

591
00:47:41.969 --> 00:47:46.149
it sounds a bit weird. Uh The the the

592
00:47:46.159 --> 00:47:48.909
surgeon said, like look at my head scans, right?

593
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:55.340
RT G scans. Mm He, he, he said, OK,

594
00:47:55.929 --> 00:47:58.709
you cannot spot it when you, when you see

595
00:47:58.719 --> 00:48:01.899
your face, your skin. But when I see your

596
00:48:01.909 --> 00:48:08.659
skull, yeah, it's definitely Mongoloid said. All right. Um

597
00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:11.260
Yeah, and that's true. I have probably we have

598
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:14.770
some kind of Asian ancestors and sometimes it really

599
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:19.189
doesn't matter but sometimes it does. And for example,

600
00:48:19.199 --> 00:48:22.320
if we, if we think about medicine and biomedical

601
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:27.879
research, it is very important. And uh and in

602
00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:33.199
this context, I usually uh talk about uh one

603
00:48:33.209 --> 00:48:35.850
situation from my life again, like especially from my

604
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.209
mother's life to be honest. Um So she had

605
00:48:39.219 --> 00:48:44.050
some kind of um um some something grow on

606
00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.929
her jaw again and her dentist uh sent her

607
00:48:48.939 --> 00:48:53.030
to a surgeon. Uh THEY did some kind of

608
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.389
uh tests and said that probably it is a

609
00:48:57.399 --> 00:49:00.870
cancer like a serious cancer. Uh BUT they have

610
00:49:00.879 --> 00:49:03.110
to do a biopsy because they are not sure

611
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.939
they cannot recognize it. And she was like, afraid

612
00:49:06.949 --> 00:49:10.780
she's dying for about three months. Uh Everyone was

613
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:15.300
saying we are not sure we cannot interpret your

614
00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:20.949
uh results. Uh WE have some doubts but probably

615
00:49:20.959 --> 00:49:24.290
this serious and she didn't know what's happening with

616
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.979
her. As long as one of her doctors sent

617
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:31.919
her uh medical data, health data to some kind

618
00:49:31.929 --> 00:49:35.889
of international conference. And in Poland, we don't gather

619
00:49:35.899 --> 00:49:39.129
and use erac categories when it comes to uh

620
00:49:39.149 --> 00:49:43.080
health data. So there was no information about her,

621
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:49.020
the color of her skin. Uh AND as, as

622
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.679
fast as her skin was invisible to those people,

623
00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:55.840
they only had her scans and the information like

624
00:49:55.850 --> 00:50:00.399
the data, someone quickly said, OK, this is nothing,

625
00:50:00.649 --> 00:50:03.560
this is nothing serious. This is just this uh

626
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:07.399
uh Asian thing that many Asians has, but it's,

627
00:50:07.409 --> 00:50:10.040
it's not serious. Uh So, so she should, she

628
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:14.020
should be fine. So she had to lose her

629
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:19.270
skin like metaphorically and lose her race to be

630
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:26.270
di di diagnosed, right? And that kind of mistakes

631
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:34.429
in diagnosis may happen uh repeatedly when we believe

632
00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:41.820
that race, especially someone's skin color and someone's identity

633
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.570
may be a good proxy uh for some kind

634
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:51.280
of genetical polymorphisms. Sorry in our like there is

635
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:52.949
no gene for race.

636
00:50:53.689 --> 00:50:56.790
Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's the thing, right? Because

637
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.629
I was just going to ask you about that,

638
00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:03.199
what in terms of health information, what are some

639
00:51:03.209 --> 00:51:08.120
of the consequences that we having or we, I

640
00:51:08.129 --> 00:51:11.370
mean, I'm saying that in particular countries it works

641
00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:16.790
like that people have uh racialized health information and

642
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.639
what, what are some of the biggest consequences of

643
00:51:21.649 --> 00:51:24.810
the the the negative consequences. Of course. So

644
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.239
again, this is a very problematic issue like a

645
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:34.360
very problematic uh question because from the one side,

646
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.469
there is a huge gap in knowledge about the

647
00:51:38.479 --> 00:51:44.479
whole minorities, right? And in the history of science,

648
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:51.820
most research was done on white privilege, middle class

649
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:57.290
and young men uh because they studied in those

650
00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:03.070
universities, universities where the research was done. Of course.

651
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.850
So for example, in neuroscience, until the beginning of

652
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:17.219
uh 21st century, hm most scans like uh F

653
00:52:17.229 --> 00:52:20.020
MRI s and everything was done on, on, on

654
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:26.939
white uh middle class men around 2022 or something

655
00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:31.939
like that. And it was, it was a huge

656
00:52:31.949 --> 00:52:38.219
issue. So we started to gather a data about

657
00:52:38.229 --> 00:52:44.340
other populations, about other cultures, like pe representatives from

658
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.649
other cultures uh about representatives of groups that were

659
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:54.750
um um were excluded from, from uh research before.

660
00:52:55.989 --> 00:52:59.409
And this is great because we need to know

661
00:52:59.419 --> 00:53:08.770
more about uh body uh woman bodies about um

662
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:14.270
bodies of people who experienced racism, uh bodies of

663
00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.510
people who, who have totally different experiences than ours,

664
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:23.699
how it affects them, uh how different geographical um

665
00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:30.100
um environment or economical environment changes and affects us.

666
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:33.669
Uh We, we need that knowledge, right? We also

667
00:53:33.679 --> 00:53:36.520
need the knowledge about how we respond to different

668
00:53:36.639 --> 00:53:42.899
psychological environments or how we should design cars for,

669
00:53:42.909 --> 00:53:46.790
for people who are not a standard person, right?

670
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.739
And the standard person is always white. So um

671
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.219
in the mail, of course, so this is great

672
00:53:55.229 --> 00:53:59.060
that we started to, to somehow worked with this

673
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:04.830
problem of a huge knowledge gap about other others,

674
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:15.419
generally. However, um when we are understanding those differences

675
00:54:15.429 --> 00:54:20.050
through those categories of race and ethnicity, um again,

676
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:25.360
we are doing this mistake that we keep thinking

677
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:30.159
with essentialist and racist classes, I would say. Um

678
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:36.090
SO why it is important for uh uh to,

679
00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.239
to talk about those issues uh when it comes

680
00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:42.610
to health care and biomedical research, especially healthcare, because

681
00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:46.199
you asked me about medical care, right? It's uh

682
00:54:47.169 --> 00:54:54.969
it is because first um this is uh something

683
00:54:54.979 --> 00:55:02.389
that is uh making racist beliefs stronger. So for

684
00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:06.149
example, if we, even if we have a very

685
00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:11.110
good uh intuition, like very good motivations, we want

686
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.219
to, we don't want to be color blind, right?

687
00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:20.500
Uh And we want to um fully acknowledge that

688
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:26.459
we have uh patients that are from minorities and

689
00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:31.479
that may have some kind of medical issues because

690
00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:34.699
of that, for example, because of the effect of

691
00:55:34.709 --> 00:55:40.469
um uh racist discrimination on their health. Um If

692
00:55:40.479 --> 00:55:47.120
we just in fear that it is possible from

693
00:55:47.129 --> 00:55:53.810
the color of their skin, then we are usually

694
00:55:54.219 --> 00:56:00.229
um as uh thinking about it in a way

695
00:56:00.239 --> 00:56:05.919
that is somehow racist just because we applied it

696
00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:13.770
all this framework or connected with racial um discrimination

697
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.729
and it includes uh worse access to education and

698
00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:25.290
living in poverty and maybe some totally racist stuff

699
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:31.409
like lower IQ um and things like that. But

700
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:35.909
why, like, maybe this is a person who is

701
00:56:35.919 --> 00:56:41.030
twice as rich and uh you know, like wealthy

702
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:47.500
and economically privileged um than 20% of white people

703
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:49.489
in states or something like that, who of course

704
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:54.030
have their privilege as well. But we need to

705
00:56:55.330 --> 00:57:01.449
learn how to uh recognize those aspects of our

706
00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:07.649
identity that tell us something about the discrimination that

707
00:57:07.659 --> 00:57:12.429
we could um experience. So when we try to

708
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:18.870
um research do research about the impact of racism

709
00:57:18.879 --> 00:57:23.149
and racialization on, on people's health, we need to

710
00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:26.909
be able to recognize on about which level of

711
00:57:26.919 --> 00:57:30.229
racialization we are talking about. Are we talking about

712
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:35.459
lower access to health care in terms of um

713
00:57:36.649 --> 00:57:42.250
like space that divides people from hospitals, like geographically

714
00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:46.419
speaking, like very, very material thing or are we

715
00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:53.020
talking about some kind of uh epigen uh historical

716
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:58.770
problems that the members of certain communities faced their,

717
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:03.520
their ancestors? Um So some kind of traumas could

718
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:07.320
be passed through generations or maybe we are talking

719
00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:13.600
about the fact that uh someone uh won't get

720
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:17.360
some kind of, I don't know uh uh won't

721
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:21.129
get a scholarship or won't be published in the

722
00:58:21.139 --> 00:58:24.699
scientific journal because he or she is from, I

723
00:58:24.709 --> 00:58:30.479
don't know, Mongolia and people usually don't treat scientists

724
00:58:30.489 --> 00:58:33.070
who are not from core countries as seriously as

725
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.050
others. So, Yeah, we, we just need to recognize

726
00:58:37.399 --> 00:58:40.790
about what we are talking about, right? And when

727
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.409
we just use race and ethnicity, there are just

728
00:58:44.419 --> 00:58:49.360
two broad concepts. They, they re relate to so

729
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.889
many different ways of discrimination, to so many different

730
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:57.479
experiences, to so many different things that, that no

731
00:58:57.489 --> 00:59:00.969
one knows about what they are talking.

732
00:59:02.219 --> 00:59:04.479
Right? And let, let me ask you a very

733
00:59:04.489 --> 00:59:09.669
specific uh related question to medicine and health care

734
00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:14.189
because I mean, by using categories like race and

735
00:59:14.199 --> 00:59:17.399
ethnicity. But I guess even more so race and

736
00:59:17.409 --> 00:59:20.629
medicine, one thing that people do is that they

737
00:59:20.639 --> 00:59:26.310
study the prevalence of certain diseases across different races,

738
00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:31.169
right? And uh together with that, usually I'm not,

739
00:59:31.179 --> 00:59:33.739
I'm not saying that always, but usually comes the

740
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.100
assumption that because they find uh there, that there's

741
00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:41.810
a difference in prevalence of certain diseases across races,

742
00:59:41.909 --> 00:59:46.830
there must be a genetic basis to, to those

743
00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:52.429
differences, right? And but isn't that also somewhat problematic?

744
00:59:52.439 --> 00:59:54.750
Uh I, I don't know if you agree with

745
00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.699
what I'm about to say or not, but I've

746
00:59:56.709 --> 01:00:00.080
also talked with a few sociologists on the show.

747
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:03.790
And actually, for example, in the US, uh they

748
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.159
criticize some of the ways that people in medicine

749
01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:13.489
deal with health information, racialized health information because uh

750
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.409
they say that uh perhaps there are some diseases

751
01:00:18.419 --> 01:00:22.760
that have higher prevalence in uh black people. Uh

752
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:28.709
Black Americans, not because of their race or anything

753
01:00:28.719 --> 01:00:32.639
genetic, but because, uh, I mean, if you look

754
01:00:32.649 --> 01:00:42.320
at the socio-economic data, usually, uh, african-americans fare worse

755
01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:47.050
in terms of their socio-economic status than, uh, whites

756
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.000
in America. And so some of that might be

757
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:55.469
explained not by genes or genetics, but by the,

758
01:00:55.479 --> 01:01:00.169
by them being poor, their socio-economic status and all

759
01:01:00.179 --> 01:01:04.459
of the things they are exposed to while poor

760
01:01:04.534 --> 01:01:09.784
that perhaps other, uh, o, other groups in America

761
01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:13.695
are not as exposed to as they are. And

762
01:01:13.705 --> 01:01:15.534
I mean, I'm not saying with all of these

763
01:01:15.544 --> 01:01:20.155
deaths, some diseases uh do not have any genetic

764
01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:22.955
basis at all. Of course, some of them have.

765
01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:26.260
But still, I mean, there are, there are these

766
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:30.989
complications that derived from the fact that uh there

767
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.139
are certain instances where we use racialized information in

768
01:01:36.149 --> 01:01:36.810
medicine.

769
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.399
Yes. So yeah, I I was talking about it

770
01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:45.620
actually, like there are some kind of differences that

771
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:52.020
uh are caused by social, cultural or economic and

772
01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:59.129
environmental factors generally uh that may be spotted and

773
01:01:59.139 --> 01:02:05.830
recognized as racial differences. But they um are there,

774
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.889
there was this uh great sentence that I really

775
01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:13.689
loved uh uh And that was pretty popular during

776
01:02:13.699 --> 01:02:21.159
COVID pandemic. Uh WHEN researchers try to criticize the

777
01:02:21.169 --> 01:02:26.250
biolog organization of uh differences when it comes to

778
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:33.159
deaths uh of COVID between different communities. And they

779
01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:36.550
use this uh a phrase that it's not a

780
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.989
matter of race, it is a matter of racism.

781
01:02:40.239 --> 01:02:44.649
So, yeah, there are many differences between com like

782
01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:49.709
many health differences in between communities and populations that

783
01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:57.800
are caused by uh racism and social inequalities. However,

784
01:02:57.810 --> 01:03:00.790
there are also some kind of differences between populations

785
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.610
that are caused by our genes. But yet, as

786
01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.030
I said before, category of race and ethnicity are

787
01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.340
not perfect categories to be used as a proxy

788
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:15.620
for those differences as well as our features such

789
01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:19.899
as skin color, right? Like our skin color may

790
01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:24.189
be important if we want to study how we

791
01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:32.520
uh actually mm gain vitamin D, right? Because this

792
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:32.810
is or

793
01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:38.669
perhaps for example, differences in uh in, in developing

794
01:03:38.679 --> 01:03:39.729
skin cancer.

795
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:46.860
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let's use a skin color

796
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.620
when we are researching something that is connected to

797
01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:53.120
skin color, right? But even then the category of

798
01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:56.399
race and ethnicity say us nothing. We just need

799
01:03:56.409 --> 01:04:01.810
to use, you know, some kind of uh gradient

800
01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:07.360
that is related to colors because I'm not sure

801
01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.550
if uh if I'm right, but I would say

802
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.340
that many people who are white have a lighter

803
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:18.409
skin and darker skin, like my skin may get

804
01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:22.100
very dark uh during summer. But I know some

805
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:26.850
people who just go outside and get burned in

806
01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.729
like 10 seconds, right? And there probably is some

807
01:04:29.739 --> 01:04:33.739
difference here as well that should be researched. So,

808
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:39.580
so yeah, if we, if we think that our

809
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:43.340
patient, for example, or or if we think that

810
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:49.350
in our study, something may be uh caused by

811
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.459
a difference in skin color, then focus on that.

812
01:04:53.919 --> 01:04:57.860
If we think that some kind of differences between

813
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:02.229
populations or, or communities may be caused by socio

814
01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.639
economic factors, then we should use some kind of

815
01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:16.800
uh measures like frameworks that measure uh socioeconomical uh

816
01:05:17.489 --> 01:05:23.000
mm differences and vulnerability, vulnerability. I'm sorry, I cannot

817
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:29.629
pronounce this word. Vulnerability. Yeah. Yeah. This one. So

818
01:05:29.639 --> 01:05:32.229
if, if we think that some differences may be

819
01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:37.360
caused by uh some kind of differences in health

820
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:43.520
literacy or diet, we should look at those but

821
01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:47.760
not race in general because all whites don't eat

822
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.679
the same food and all blacks don't eat the

823
01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:53.649
same food, right? So uh we just need to

824
01:05:53.659 --> 01:05:57.270
be more precise about what we are researching. And

825
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.889
this is what I'm trying to say that in

826
01:05:58.899 --> 01:06:03.199
some cases, a no racial identity may be very

827
01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:06.389
important if we want to me, like if we

828
01:06:06.399 --> 01:06:12.870
want to investigate, for example, how people experience stress

829
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:18.209
caused by their identity or how they, how does

830
01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:23.129
the level of stress differs between them and between

831
01:06:23.139 --> 01:06:28.129
people who self-identity differently? Like as a minority, for

832
01:06:28.139 --> 01:06:32.479
example, when they face uh police uh policemen, a

833
01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:36.110
police. Uh Yeah, just a police. Uh AND it

834
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.340
is um uh it is uh it was studied

835
01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:45.040
by many researchers that usually people who are um

836
01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:49.620
representatives of minorities. Of course, usually in those, in

837
01:06:49.629 --> 01:06:54.600
those studies, it is written that black communities and

838
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.800
African Americans have a higher level of stress w

839
01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:01.459
while facing police than whites. And this is totally

840
01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:04.719
normal because of course they are discriminated and they

841
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.939
have to face this violence um on a day

842
01:07:07.949 --> 01:07:14.729
or daily basis. But then, um, so, so then,

843
01:07:15.169 --> 01:07:19.689
um their, their identity is important, it is relevant

844
01:07:19.699 --> 01:07:23.699
in this particular context, but it's not relevant in

845
01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:26.649
a, in a context of our genome. Right.

846
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.800
Right. A and so, I mean, basically these ideas

847
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:35.300
that you're putting on the table now about looking

848
01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:39.909
at what's relevant in each particular case is what

849
01:07:39.919 --> 01:07:44.790
perhaps a post racial kind of medicine would look

850
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.080
like. Right.

851
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:49.459
Um Maybe, yes, like we, we just need to

852
01:07:50.419 --> 01:07:55.209
be, I, I love precision. Probably, maybe because uh

853
01:07:55.219 --> 01:07:58.800
I'm a philosopher. Uh AND I wonder what concept

854
01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:03.189
means? Maybe because I'm autistic and I love precision

855
01:08:03.199 --> 01:08:08.870
even more. Uh But hm I think that in

856
01:08:08.879 --> 01:08:12.739
science to make it functional and to, to, to

857
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:17.299
functionally communicate with other scientists, not to, not to

858
01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:21.029
just create a huge mess like conceptual mess as

859
01:08:21.379 --> 01:08:24.740
um as it is with, with the case of

860
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:28.419
race and ethnicity and their use in biomedical research,

861
01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:31.660
we need to be precise but to do so,

862
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:36.798
we need to be aware that each of us

863
01:08:36.858 --> 01:08:40.849
has a lot of beliefs that are sometimes even

864
01:08:40.858 --> 01:08:46.028
unconscious. Uh A lot of ontological methodological beliefs that

865
01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:52.310
we just acquired through our cultural training, education from

866
01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:57.350
our scientific community even. And we usually don't question

867
01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:02.788
them. But if we, if we just use some

868
01:09:02.798 --> 01:09:07.950
kind of categories without any asking any questions, especially

869
01:09:07.959 --> 01:09:11.430
if they are those such a controversial and, and

870
01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:19.310
so powerful categories. Um Then it is, it is

871
01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.500
um we need to, we need to ask those

872
01:09:21.509 --> 01:09:25.339
questions, what are we, what kind of differences we

873
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:29.959
are looking for? Um What we are researching, what

874
01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:35.719
do we want to say? Because even by like

875
01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:40.957
the only by designing our research in one way

876
01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:46.069
or another, uh we change our results and and

877
01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.810
we we can affect it. So there is this

878
01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:56.899
uh um this quote that what we put into

879
01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:00.140
our, you know, research data, for example, it is

880
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:05.580
what we get in our results. So do we

881
01:10:05.589 --> 01:10:08.660
need to put a racial data everywhere or those

882
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:12.649
categories everywhere. This is another question that from my

883
01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.870
perspective is very important like in in USA uh

884
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.899
some institutions that finance uh biomedical research require scientists

885
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:26.930
to use gutter and use erac categories in their

886
01:10:26.939 --> 01:10:33.000
studies. So they actually need to use race and

887
01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:37.649
ethnicity as one uh of reference classes or subgroups

888
01:10:37.899 --> 01:10:41.509
in their research, right? But it it is not

889
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.540
a neutral, it is somehow it may affect what

890
01:10:47.549 --> 01:10:50.279
they are researching, how they are doing it and

891
01:10:50.290 --> 01:10:52.890
what kind of results they are getting out of

892
01:10:52.899 --> 01:10:56.810
the the research. So yeah, the the awareness of

893
01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:01.279
like methodological and conceptual awareness in science is very

894
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.729
important from my point of view.

895
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:10.200
So let's change topics completely now, and getting into

896
01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:13.620
the last part of our interview, let's talk about

897
01:11:13.629 --> 01:11:18.000
a completely different topic that is human robot interaction

898
01:11:18.009 --> 01:11:21.669
because you also have some interesting work on that.

899
01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.930
I read a few papers of yours on that.

900
01:11:23.939 --> 01:11:26.540
And uh I would like to ask you because

901
01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:29.020
when it comes to human robot interaction, I mean,

902
01:11:29.029 --> 01:11:31.600
there are many different aspects of it that we

903
01:11:31.609 --> 01:11:34.299
could talk about here. But I would actually like

904
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:39.689
to ask you about empathy specifically. So uh this

905
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.339
empathy apply in this context of human robot interaction.

906
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:46.959
I mean, is it even possible for humans to

907
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.899
feel empathy for robots?

908
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.740
So yeah, I think so. Um THERE is uh

909
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:59.939
there are some kind of studies showing that those

910
01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:04.509
uh areas of our brains are similarly activated when

911
01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.189
we also report feeling empathy toward robots. As when

912
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:16.759
we report feeling empathy with people, uh people, people

913
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:20.850
feel that empathy like they, they can describe it

914
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:25.810
as similarly to a situation when we feel empathy

915
01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:30.520
to some kind of cartoons. Uh WHEN we, while

916
01:12:30.529 --> 01:12:34.629
we are watching movies or you know, when you

917
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.089
have uh plaques in your wall for electricity, electricity,

918
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.819
sometimes they look so sad or so happy like

919
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.660
when they looks like they have eyes and a

920
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:49.549
face. So we have, we are those weird animals

921
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:56.049
uh that have this tendency to anthropomorphize other beings

922
01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:03.250
and other entities. Uh uh And if those entities

923
01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:07.009
have some kind of features that makes it easier

924
01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.890
for us to anthropomorphize them then, yeah, we easily

925
01:13:10.899 --> 01:13:11.439
do so.

926
01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.879
A a and, but what would be perhaps from

927
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:19.029
the perspective of philosophy of science? And I guess

928
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.479
that in this particular case, the specific areas of

929
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:25.939
philosophy of science that would apply here would be

930
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:30.680
something like philosophy of cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, uh

931
01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:35.879
disciplines like that. What are some of the explanations

932
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:40.080
out there for why we might feel empathy for

933
01:13:40.089 --> 01:13:41.040
robots?

934
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:47.180
Ok. So, hm, this is a problem that I

935
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:53.790
investigated um as a result of my previous research

936
01:13:53.799 --> 01:13:58.229
on other uh race effect uh and using category

937
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.799
of race in neuroscience because I had to write

938
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:06.890
something about robot be robots being uh a part

939
01:14:06.899 --> 01:14:08.859
of the team where the P I asked me,

940
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:11.279
OK, you should do so. So, you know, you

941
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:13.899
don't have a job, you have to, you have

942
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:18.450
to uh take what they give you. So, so

943
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:23.680
yeah, uh I had to switch and after reading

944
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:27.740
a lot of papers about um uh human robot

945
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:31.649
interactions, I just spotted that in many cases they

946
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.439
refer to empathy. Um And as I already told

947
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:38.220
you, I love precision, but I saw that this

948
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:41.680
term, this notion empathy is used differently and understood

949
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:46.160
differently in almost every, every study. And that's OK.

950
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:49.600
We can agree that sometimes when some kind of

951
01:14:49.609 --> 01:14:53.750
concepts uh even if they are, even if no

952
01:14:53.759 --> 01:14:55.720
one knows what they mean, they are used, but

953
01:14:55.729 --> 01:15:00.689
they works, that's fine. That's fair enough. But at

954
01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:05.609
the same time, I put it that first, those

955
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:11.660
interactions uh and our ability to empathize with um

956
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:18.029
robotic agents depends on factors that are very similar

957
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:26.529
to those that shape um inter uh like intergroup

958
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:32.330
um relations between, for example, the representatives of different

959
01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:40.890
um ethno racial groups. So um that many different

960
01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.060
factors may shape our attitudes towards robots and uh

961
01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:50.939
they may affect the, the way we empathize with

962
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:53.490
them or if we empathize with them or how

963
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.060
much, how is the level of this empathy? Uh

964
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:02.200
And the third thing was that I also a

965
01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:07.330
as a philosopher, I know that many, many of

966
01:16:07.339 --> 01:16:12.930
us are very conservative in a way. Um We

967
01:16:12.939 --> 01:16:18.299
understand such a basic uh concept such as society.

968
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.620
So for example, when I start, uh when I

969
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:25.669
wrote my first uh paper about empathy in human

970
01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:29.540
interactions, and I send it to some Polish journal.

971
01:16:29.959 --> 01:16:33.310
Uh I get a review that it is uh

972
01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:37.450
nonsense to talk about any kind of social relations

973
01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:41.419
with robots because robots cannot be social agents, right?

974
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:45.689
Because social agents need to be conscious. Uh AND

975
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.899
they need to have some kind of social intentions,

976
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:51.729
et cetera. But yeah, but at the same time,

977
01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.770
our social ontology is changing when, when our culture

978
01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.339
is changing and it is shaped by technology, right?

979
01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:03.299
And we are thinking about animals in terms of

980
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:08.580
personhood. So why not to think about robots as

981
01:17:08.589 --> 01:17:13.399
some kind of partners in our social reality, especially

982
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.810
that it is more about how we interpret them

983
01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.870
uh than if they like if robots feel empathy

984
01:17:21.879 --> 01:17:25.529
because of course, at this stage of our technology,

985
01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:30.490
it's, yeah, it's a very abstract question. Um My

986
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:36.990
question was more about is it um useful or

987
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.830
is it justified to use the term from methodological

988
01:17:41.839 --> 01:17:44.629
point of view to use the term empathy while

989
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:51.350
studying interaction between people and robots. But and yes,

990
01:17:51.359 --> 01:17:53.350
it is from my point of view, it is,

991
01:17:53.359 --> 01:17:59.919
it is uh it is very um it there

992
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:03.390
are many arguments supporting the the thesis that that

993
01:18:03.399 --> 01:18:09.839
empathy is something that that can be uh successfully

994
01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:15.160
used uh in human robot interaction studies. Uh First

995
01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:20.509
of all, as I already said, people report feeling

996
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:25.709
empathy, then neuro head scans and F MRI studies

997
01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:31.259
show similar levels of activity in similar brain areas

998
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:36.350
that uh yeah, then like the most important thing

999
01:18:36.359 --> 01:18:42.140
is that s the function of social robots is

1000
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:47.129
to somehow get into social interaction with their users,

1001
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:53.100
right? For example, to become a substitute of human

1002
01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:59.299
relations when it comes to other people in houses,

1003
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:04.640
when they feel very lonely. Uh It's it's getting

1004
01:19:04.649 --> 01:19:06.870
more and more popular even here in my city

1005
01:19:06.879 --> 01:19:11.669
in Pozna uh in in some uh hospitals or

1006
01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.529
uh places where, where with many elder people and

1007
01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.910
we have those uh small um se not Sequels

1008
01:19:21.919 --> 01:19:28.419
but um some white like sea creature, which is

1009
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:34.850
super sweet and cool. Like, like the one that

1010
01:19:34.859 --> 01:19:37.770
is playing in a ball in a circus, like

1011
01:19:37.779 --> 01:19:38.589
in a very stereotype,

1012
01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:41.109
stereotypical uh dolphins,

1013
01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:50.209
not dolphins. Um, NEVER mind. Sorry. Uh In po

1014
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.819
it's Foer.

1015
01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:55.580
00, yeah. Oh my God. I, I'm missing the

1016
01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:55.790
name.

1017
01:19:57.370 --> 01:19:57.970
I'm also

1018
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.089
missing. Uh IT'S, it's a sea, it's not sea

1019
01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.569
lion or is it?

1020
01:20:07.109 --> 01:20:09.209
Yeah, I don't know why.

1021
01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.009
Look, I'm also not sure, at least at the

1022
01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:14.229
moment, I'm not sure if it's sea lion

1023
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:18.580
or not. So sorry people uh excuse us. We

1024
01:20:18.589 --> 01:20:18.930
are.

1025
01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.890
Yeah, I, I usually, I usually do not talk,

1026
01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.220
I usually do not talk about these animals in

1027
01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.209
this. Yeah,

1028
01:20:28.770 --> 01:20:31.830
me neither. So, so yeah. Uh THEY are used

1029
01:20:31.839 --> 01:20:34.310
in many that kind of situations where as a

1030
01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:39.799
substitute of, of human interactions like social interactions and

1031
01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:45.319
it is totally relevant because our societies are getting

1032
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:49.000
older and, and we have to do something about

1033
01:20:49.009 --> 01:20:52.470
it right? There is more and more older people

1034
01:20:52.479 --> 01:20:55.560
in our communities that, that feel this loneliness and

1035
01:20:55.569 --> 01:21:00.910
it affects their mental and physical health. So um

1036
01:21:03.049 --> 01:21:07.589
yeah, why um why this is a question? Like

1037
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.939
why bother? OK. There are those studies that use

1038
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:16.419
this term empathy, people report it. So why, why

1039
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:21.529
it's, it's something to, to, to talk about, right?

1040
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.299
Even if some philosopher said it's no, it's a

1041
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:27.819
nonsense because robots cannot be social. It is just

1042
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:33.189
one person in Poland, right? Uh uh Yeah, but,

1043
01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.359
but I thought that maybe um again, it would

1044
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:43.689
be much um more functional and much more useful

1045
01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:48.959
if we try to somehow recognize how this empathy

1046
01:21:49.319 --> 01:21:53.660
thing is understood in that kind of research. And

1047
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:56.600
what does it really mean? And is it the

1048
01:21:56.609 --> 01:22:01.799
same empathy as we feel uh when we have

1049
01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:06.720
a contact with people or not, usually empathy is

1050
01:22:06.729 --> 01:22:11.290
understood as some kind of relation, like something that

1051
01:22:11.299 --> 01:22:16.069
you feel because someone else felt right is like

1052
01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.879
a coil, right? Like uh like some kind of

1053
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:25.189
effect because someone else felt something there are those

1054
01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:31.029
um theories about mirror neurons and things like that.

1055
01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:35.049
It's not that important in this context, but what

1056
01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.609
is important is all right. So how can we

1057
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.990
empathize with some something that doesn't even feel right?

1058
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:51.819
Um Why, why should we research something like this?

1059
01:22:52.339 --> 01:22:55.850
Uh First as I said, because this is the

1060
01:22:55.859 --> 01:23:00.680
function of those mechanisms, they sh in some cases,

1061
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:04.859
they should make us feel empathy, empathetic. But in

1062
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:09.140
other cases, in other situations, we should also know

1063
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:15.319
how to stop this. Um THIS uh some kind

1064
01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:20.450
of uh empathic relation because it might be uh

1065
01:23:21.479 --> 01:23:26.740
unfunctional or unuseful. For example, as in the case

1066
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:33.819
of military robots, when they should just b um

1067
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:37.709
some kind of like they just support human operators

1068
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:44.879
and and uh human um forces on a on

1069
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:49.799
the front line. But if those people who work

1070
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:53.459
with those robots feel empathy towards them, then their

1071
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:56.379
life may be endangered and there are some cases

1072
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:59.759
of such situations, right? So we have to know,

1073
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:04.649
we, first of all, we can learn a lot

1074
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:09.060
about ourselves about our ability to empathize with others

1075
01:24:09.209 --> 01:24:13.560
by studying human robot interactions. Because it's much easier

1076
01:24:13.569 --> 01:24:18.020
for example, to, to repeat some kind of experiments

1077
01:24:18.029 --> 01:24:21.410
with robots than to repeat them with people to

1078
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:26.250
somehow I don't know, to check how we uh

1079
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:32.209
uh rep replay or like how we um react

1080
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:39.250
to uh when we see robots being heard, then

1081
01:24:39.259 --> 01:24:43.310
how we react, seeing people being hurt, right? So

1082
01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:47.240
yeah, we can learn a lot about empathy in

1083
01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:51.560
people like, you know, uh by, by that kind

1084
01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:54.500
of research. And I think it's fascinating also, I

1085
01:24:54.509 --> 01:24:59.009
think it's fascinating how we understand empathy. Maybe it's

1086
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:03.640
not something very like substantial, maybe there is a,

1087
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:11.470
it is more uh moral relational thing. And there

1088
01:25:11.479 --> 01:25:16.979
are that kind of interpretations of relations between robots

1089
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:20.540
and people that this is a matter of relation.

1090
01:25:20.879 --> 01:25:25.049
And it doesn't really matter if robot answer to

1091
01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.020
us with the real feelings, it's more a matter

1092
01:25:28.029 --> 01:25:33.529
of what is happening, which was between human, like

1093
01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:37.910
uh be between human and robotic agent. And I

1094
01:25:37.919 --> 01:25:41.509
think when it comes to social robots, especially the

1095
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.140
uh to the, when it comes to those who,

1096
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:48.700
who could work in health care, for example, um

1097
01:25:50.069 --> 01:25:53.450
the this question about this relation and how to

1098
01:25:53.459 --> 01:25:58.669
design this relation, how we should design the the

1099
01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.049
look of the robot, its name its uh its

1100
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:06.049
voice because all of the those little details matter

1101
01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:09.879
when it comes to interactions with others because we

1102
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:12.600
may feel more familiar with them or less familiar,

1103
01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:17.290
we may feel endangered or, or, or not by

1104
01:26:17.299 --> 01:26:21.879
someone who, who is so different than us or,

1105
01:26:21.959 --> 01:26:28.709
or, or too, too alike as us. So trying

1106
01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:32.790
to, to answer to the question is the real

1107
01:26:32.799 --> 01:26:39.450
empathy between in those interactions? Mm I understood that.

1108
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:42.779
OK. It's there are there are there are really

1109
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.490
more interesting questions there, like what kind of factors

1110
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.729
shape this relation, how we can change it in

1111
01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:56.770
which situations it is good to somehow heighten this

1112
01:26:56.779 --> 01:27:00.919
level of empathy towards robots in which we should

1113
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:04.810
somehow lower it and how it can change our

1114
01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:10.729
society as a whole. Mm If we will use

1115
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:14.919
that kind of manipulations also, what kind of dangerous

1116
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:21.740
comes with a manipulation uh with our empathetic reactions

1117
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:25.709
to robots? We can easily imagine that some kind

1118
01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.899
of very cute puppy like robots will ask us

1119
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:33.759
to for example, will be will be sold as

1120
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:38.319
the toys and ask our Children to to buy

1121
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:43.359
them more um more I don't know to like

1122
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.750
toys or clothes or other kind of stuff uh

1123
01:27:48.759 --> 01:27:52.149
or some kind of applications. And by doing those

1124
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.490
cute faces like from uh Pixar movies, they will

1125
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:02.100
just manipulate our reactions and make us feel uh

1126
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:06.330
pretty, you know, vulnerable to, to, to what they

1127
01:28:06.339 --> 01:28:11.790
ask for, especially if they will create relations with

1128
01:28:11.799 --> 01:28:15.310
the the youngest Children, for example, right. So yeah,

1129
01:28:15.319 --> 01:28:17.479
there, there are a lot of questions here that

1130
01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:21.080
are very interesting from my point of view and

1131
01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:25.859
and empathy is just a yeah, the question about

1132
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:28.859
empathy is just a starting question here. Probably.

1133
01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.149
No, that that is all very interesting and I

1134
01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.629
guess uh just uh and this probably will be

1135
01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.319
my last question. But uh you mentioned something at

1136
01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:43.540
a certain point there, you mentioned uh the relational

1137
01:28:43.549 --> 01:28:47.529
aspect that perhaps many people question that we are

1138
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.359
really able to establish some sort of relationship with

1139
01:28:52.569 --> 01:28:57.830
robots. But actually, I mean, there are people out

1140
01:28:57.839 --> 01:29:04.779
there that report uh experiencing a sort of relational

1141
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:09.299
thing, right? With uh with robots, like for example,

1142
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:13.069
social robots and now and then you hear it

1143
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:17.439
also applied to sex robots, for example, so that

1144
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:21.259
that's something that we also have to consider. It's

1145
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:26.310
not just because robots might not be able at

1146
01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:29.200
least at this stage. And I'm not sure if

1147
01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:31.600
they ever will be able to do that, to

1148
01:29:31.779 --> 01:29:36.240
feel something about us to have for there to

1149
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:39.904
be some sort of let's say emotional reciprocity or

1150
01:29:39.915 --> 01:29:44.544
something along those lines that people uh do not

1151
01:29:44.555 --> 01:29:49.705
sometimes think about uh or uh think about the

1152
01:29:49.714 --> 01:29:54.544
their robots, the robots they use or interact with

1153
01:29:54.555 --> 01:30:01.399
certain ways as having a relationship with them, right?

1154
01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.160
Um Yeah, like this is happening all the time

1155
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:10.160
when people fall, fell in love with uh robots,

1156
01:30:10.169 --> 01:30:15.259
for example, or robotic dolls. Uh THOSE sexual robots,

1157
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:23.609
uh There is maybe more um radical form uh

1158
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:30.500
of such a situation when people suffer from something

1159
01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:33.180
called object ofilia and they fell in love in

1160
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:36.020
objects. So for example, there's this story about women

1161
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:39.620
who fell in love with Eiffel Tower, right? Or,

1162
01:30:39.919 --> 01:30:43.259
or things like that. Uh But when it comes

1163
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:50.870
to, to social robots, uh mm The question is

1164
01:30:50.879 --> 01:30:54.350
how we define emotions and how we define relations

1165
01:30:54.359 --> 01:30:58.370
and what really matters to us, right? Can we

1166
01:30:58.379 --> 01:31:03.729
say that we feel sad because something happened to

1167
01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:09.160
Robert? Um Yes, of course, we can feel sad

1168
01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.700
in such a situation. There are examples of those

1169
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:16.640
uh movies from Boston dynamics, right? When where people

1170
01:31:16.649 --> 01:31:20.660
kick robots that are, are very, that move in

1171
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:24.350
a very biological way and have this animal like

1172
01:31:24.359 --> 01:31:29.370
shape. So many people report that uh feeling empathy

1173
01:31:29.379 --> 01:31:34.379
those to those to those creatures, creatures mechanisms. And

1174
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:38.270
they even um there was even this website with

1175
01:31:38.279 --> 01:31:41.279
the petition stop uh robot abuse and things like

1176
01:31:41.290 --> 01:31:45.200
that. So yes, of course, it is similar to

1177
01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:48.640
our human interaction from my perspective, like I don't

1178
01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:56.750
know if people who I know who I trust

1179
01:31:56.759 --> 01:32:00.669
and who I take care for are not, for

1180
01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.830
example, psychopaths and just don't manipulate me, right? Um

1181
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:09.390
I don't know if people who pretend to be

1182
01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:15.229
interested in my, uh, well, being really are, um,

1183
01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:18.330
if I go to a shop, people are nice

1184
01:32:18.339 --> 01:32:23.430
and they are smiling, smiling. Uh, AND I usually

1185
01:32:23.439 --> 01:32:26.080
reply with a smile. Right. But is it a

1186
01:32:26.089 --> 01:32:29.589
true relation? They are getting money for it and

1187
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:33.250
maybe they are frustrating and thinking about, I don't

1188
01:32:33.259 --> 01:32:35.910
know, putting a knife in my back. Right. How

1189
01:32:35.919 --> 01:32:36.990
can I know?

1190
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:40.609
Yeah, I guess, I guess that, I guess, I

1191
01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.000
guess that what you're alluding to there is the

1192
01:32:43.009 --> 01:32:46.029
fact that, ok, so when it comes to robots,

1193
01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.810
perhaps there's nothing there, at least on their side

1194
01:32:49.819 --> 01:32:53.959
psychologically, but sometimes when it comes to humans themselves,

1195
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:57.979
uh there can be something there but it might

1196
01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:01.850
be deceitful sometimes. And so, I mean, the things

1197
01:33:01.859 --> 01:33:05.930
we attribute to other people uh might not correspond

1198
01:33:05.939 --> 01:33:07.259
to. Um,

1199
01:33:07.799 --> 01:33:12.919
NO, I, I wanted to say that, um, does

1200
01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:17.209
it really matter if robots are responding with the

1201
01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:23.450
same kind of like something similar um for us,

1202
01:33:23.459 --> 01:33:26.029
for our society at this stage, right, at the

1203
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:30.470
stage of uh of uh development, technical development and

1204
01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:34.910
social development. Of course, we can theorize about feeling

1205
01:33:34.919 --> 01:33:42.470
robots in the future, but we know so little

1206
01:33:42.479 --> 01:33:49.379
about our own reactions and emotions and we have

1207
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:54.750
so many issues with peoples and their relations the

1208
01:33:54.759 --> 01:34:03.520
to that having those robots and being able to

1209
01:34:03.529 --> 01:34:07.549
investigate some of those questions by looking at them

1210
01:34:07.649 --> 01:34:10.919
and maybe also to co shape and, and answer

1211
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:14.399
to some of the needs of people with the

1212
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:18.839
use of robots. Uh THIS is relevant and, and

1213
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:23.000
how we can do it by looking at those

1214
01:34:23.009 --> 01:34:29.370
um at those relations. Yeah, in a relational way

1215
01:34:29.379 --> 01:34:34.209
understood as a, in a, in a way as

1216
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:39.319
proposed by um Damiano and Da Michel, for example.

1217
01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:45.020
So in terms of some kind of emergent um

1218
01:34:45.259 --> 01:34:51.009
phenomena, we have action and reaction and, and the

1219
01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.799
direction of the robot is affecting us. And it

1220
01:34:54.810 --> 01:35:01.279
is a complex way of, you know, like um

1221
01:35:02.299 --> 01:35:09.140
some kind of uh biological uh behaviors, something new

1222
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:12.959
is emerging. And this uh this, this new thing

1223
01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:19.220
is uh probably mo and 100% more important to

1224
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:24.310
us because we are this conscious uh and intentional

1225
01:35:24.319 --> 01:35:30.100
uh partner of this, this interaction. And, and yeah,

1226
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:32.689
and this is, this is what is crucial here

1227
01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:39.970
that whatever robot do and can I I'm not

1228
01:35:39.979 --> 01:35:42.009
gonna say feel because of course, it is a

1229
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:51.870
nonsense but whatever it the robot and process maybe

1230
01:35:51.899 --> 01:35:55.520
uh it is not that important at this moment,

1231
01:35:55.529 --> 01:36:00.419
right? When, when we think about human robot interactions,

1232
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:03.600
it is important when we think about robot rights

1233
01:36:03.609 --> 01:36:08.910
and like question like that kind of questions. But

1234
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.740
but when we think about the development of our

1235
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:17.529
society and our knowledge about ourselves and our society,

1236
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:24.430
I believe that um there are concepts of empathy

1237
01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:27.750
and emotions that are much more interesting than just

1238
01:36:27.759 --> 01:36:33.209
saying robots cannot empathize, they cannot feel. So we

1239
01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.759
cannot empathize with them because this won't be a

1240
01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:40.089
real empathy. So you are, you are all diseased

1241
01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:44.399
like you are all lying to yourself. You cannot

1242
01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:46.990
have those feelings and if you think you have

1243
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.379
those feelings, yeah, it is not true, right? This

1244
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:56.799
is very uncreative way of, of talking about the

1245
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:59.580
that that kind of problems from my perspective. It's,

1246
01:36:59.589 --> 01:37:02.299
it's easy to say you are lying to yourself.

1247
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:06.399
It's much more interesting to say maybe there is

1248
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:09.060
something here that is happening and we have to

1249
01:37:09.069 --> 01:37:13.770
investigate this again process, right? Um Yeah, I love

1250
01:37:13.779 --> 01:37:18.560
the process while thinking about relations and entities and

1251
01:37:18.939 --> 01:37:23.529
uh about our environment and, and I think it,

1252
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:29.149
it makes um my life as a researcher mu

1253
01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.220
much more exciting than if I would just stuck

1254
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:36.339
with those conservative uh and very again, very stable

1255
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:41.140
and essentialist categories. Uh Because probably as you see

1256
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:45.850
that um my way of thinking about using category

1257
01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:49.609
of race in biomedical research and empathy here is

1258
01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:54.459
somehow similar like how to maybe revise it, understand

1259
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:58.379
it and precise it to make it more useful

1260
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:04.660
and and more appropriate, maybe. Mhm For scientifical use.

1261
01:38:04.939 --> 01:38:07.750
No. Yeah, that, that makes for a very interesting

1262
01:38:07.759 --> 01:38:11.060
parallel here. Uh AND connects very well. I guess

1263
01:38:11.069 --> 01:38:15.870
our prior discussion about race and ethnicity with these

1264
01:38:15.879 --> 01:38:21.629
discussion about empathy applied to human robot interaction. So

1265
01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.830
Johan uh I think that perhaps this is a

1266
01:38:23.839 --> 01:38:26.979
good point to end on to wrap up our

1267
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:29.890
interview on. So just before we go, would you

1268
01:38:29.899 --> 01:38:32.390
like to tell people where they can find you

1269
01:38:32.399 --> 01:38:34.060
and your work on the internet?

1270
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:38.089
Oh, yeah, of course, I'm not prepared for that.

1271
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.850
But, um, it's very easy to find me on

1272
01:38:40.859 --> 01:38:46.200
Twitter or Research Gate or uh other sources. I

1273
01:38:46.209 --> 01:38:50.629
also have my website. Uh I don't remember the

1274
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.319
address right now. Uh However, if you look for

1275
01:38:54.379 --> 01:38:57.819
Yona Carolina Malinovsky on the Twitter or research guide

1276
01:38:57.979 --> 01:39:02.049
or uh my university uh website, there is a

1277
01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:06.350
link to, to, to my uh site as well.

1278
01:39:06.359 --> 01:39:09.850
So, yeah, if you are interested in anything I

1279
01:39:09.859 --> 01:39:12.669
do, you can always email me or uh yeah,

1280
01:39:13.209 --> 01:39:15.620
I will be very happy to answer to any

1281
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:20.049
question. And thank you one more time for um

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:24.200
your invitation, Ricardo. And it was a huge pleasure

1283
01:39:24.209 --> 01:39:26.770
and a huge honor for me to be here.

1284
01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:30.660
Uh Sorry for being so chaotic and sorry for

1285
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:36.040
my uh language problems. Uh But I hope it

1286
01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:40.000
was a pleasure uh somehow interesting for, for you.

1287
01:39:40.089 --> 01:39:41.939
Thank you for all of those who listened to

1288
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:42.970
it in the end.

1289
01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:46.330
No, really? No. Look, it was great. I had

1290
01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:48.729
lots of fun talking to you. So thank you

again somewhere in the future because I bet that

1294
01:39:58.799 --> 01:40:01.589
we will have some other very interesting things to

1295
01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.470
talk about. And Thank you for your kind words

1296
01:40:04.479 --> 01:40:06.750
