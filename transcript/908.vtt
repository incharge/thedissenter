00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.859
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.629
the Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs

3
00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.439
. And today I'm joined by Doctor Ioanna Malinovsky.

4
00:00:08.478 --> 00:00:13.108
She's assistant professor of Philosophy at Adam Mitski Aic University

5
00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:16.789
in Posen Poland. The subject of her research is

6
00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:20.434
a broadly understood philosophy of science with particular emphasis on

7
00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:24.193
philosophy of medicine, philosophy of neuroscience and philosophy of

8
00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:28.385
psychology. She explores connections between these areas and questions

9
00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.514
in bioethics, epistemology, ontology and methodology. Her

10
00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:35.973
current focus is on the conceptualization and the use of

11
00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.154
ethno racial categories in medicine. So, Johanna,

12
00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:42.454
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.039
. Thank you. Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:47.060
It's a great pleasure for me to be here.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.618
OK, great. So let's start reps to introduce

16
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.658
the topic. Let me ask you what is cultural

17
00:00:55.668 --> 00:01:00.810
neuroscience and what does it focus on exactly? Mhm

18
00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.819
. So culture and neuroscience is a scientific program that

19
00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:11.730
was introduced at the beginning of uh 20th century by

20
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:18.319
few researchers from the field field of neuroscience. And

21
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:26.409
the their um biggest concern was that neuroscience usually treat

22
00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:32.319
culture to um in a, in a too reductionist

23
00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.588
way. So it, it doesn't really bother about

24
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.939
it. They, they, that they treat human

25
00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:42.909
beings and human brains in a sort of universal stick

26
00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:49.329
way. And they started to insist that and argue

27
00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:57.719
that um neuroscience should pay more attention to the cultural

28
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.000
factors uh that are involved into development of human brain

29
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.740
and human cognitive structures, as well as the interaction

30
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.909
between brain uh genes uh like the, the,

31
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.520
the, you know, epigenetic stuff and so on

32
00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:22.558
and the environment of the individuals. So, mm

33
00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:29.008
cultural neuroscience in, in is interested in those interactions

34
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.558
between those three major uh categories or entities. However

35
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:44.409
, I really believe that this term cultural neuroscience is

36
00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.960
a bit um over it already because I want to

37
00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.710
believe that most neuroscientists uh agree uh in, in

38
00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.740
2020 23 that our brains are plastic and now that

39
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.000
our genome is somehow plastic to a point of course

40
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.460
, and that we are uh bios, social beings

41
00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.460
like bios, social animals. So we are developing

42
00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:17.088
uh and, and uh while we are doing so

43
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.399
we are somehow embedding the cultural uh the cultural factors

44
00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.008
and the, the, the cultural aspects of our

45
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.099
living and the, the uh cultural, socio,

46
00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.808
cultural aspects of our environment. So the, the

47
00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.288
culture and the society is a part of our cognitive

48
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.669
um of our cognitive uh structure itself. Um And

49
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.740
just to finish when the culture of the, the

50
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.338
neuroscience started to develop, there was this huge um

51
00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:06.800
the biggest thing in neuroscience was probably the it was

52
00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:15.460
probably the whole bunch of researchers uh interested in evolutionary

53
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.759
psychology and things like that. Right? So the

54
00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.500
very, again, very universal perspective and very red

55
00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:28.730
reductionist perspective uh when it comes to our minds and

56
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:31.319
, and our functioning like epistemic and cognitive functioning.

57
00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:38.230
While mm at the moment, we already know that

58
00:04:38.238 --> 00:04:42.980
many of those ideas. For example, the the

59
00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:46.230
thing that there is some kind of no normal brain

60
00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:48.420
and that each brain should look the same. Uh

61
00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:53.949
And that the same structures should be in the same

62
00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:58.220
place, have the same um should be um in

63
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.259
the same size and things like that. It is

64
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:03.699
uh it is some kind of idealization that is totally

65
00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:10.220
wrong because our, our brains are developing through all

66
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.959
our lives and the way how they are shaped depends

67
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.709
on our experiences. Mhm uh And so uh one

68
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.439
of the topics you've been interested in recently or in

69
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.509
recent times is uh race and ethno racial categories in

70
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.358
medicine. But in science more broadly, I guess

71
00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.160
. So what do you think about the use of

72
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:41.759
the category of race in science more generally before we

73
00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.040
get into medicine itself? Do you think it is

74
00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:48.069
scientific at all to use it? So this,

75
00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:50.399
this is actually the problem with the category of race

76
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.790
and ethnicity, but especially with the category of race

77
00:05:55.338 --> 00:06:00.750
. Um So for me, it's uh the,

78
00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.619
the great analogy is to think about this this term

79
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.428
, this notion of race as it was some kind

80
00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.399
of mythical creature creature. So everyone knows something about

81
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.889
it, but no one actually knows what it is

82
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.829
. And this is what actually is happening when people

83
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:25.959
are talking about race and science, especially. So

84
00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.009
, first of all, it is a highly contextual

85
00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.600
category. So each community is actually understanding and interpreting

86
00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:42.048
um it in their own way. Also each community

87
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:47.559
is actually trying to somehow set or negotiate their racial

88
00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.569
hierarchies in their own way. So even if there

89
00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:56.040
are no people of color in that community, they

90
00:06:56.048 --> 00:07:02.798
will probably try to somehow develop. Uh Norac Karch

91
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.199
is based on other criteria than just skin color.

92
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:14.298
Uh to be honest, uh racism itself uh may

93
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:18.230
be interpreted as a phenomena that started uh as something

94
00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:24.160
that was not only um associated with the skin color

95
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.928
, but also uh was based on criteria such as

96
00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:33.329
uh nationality or religion. Uh For example, in

97
00:07:33.338 --> 00:07:39.910
the peninsula in like 15 century where people who weren't

98
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.278
, uh Catholics were uh yeah, were sent off

99
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.619
uh because they had a different religion and they were

100
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:51.119
treated differently. Also, there was this uh at

101
00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:56.129
that time, the i the idea that there might

102
00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:00.040
be some kind of pure blood and the blood that

103
00:08:00.048 --> 00:08:03.639
isn't pure uh was developed and it was also related

104
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:09.920
to the religion at first. So, um so

105
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:13.230
as I said, first of all, race means

106
00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:16.048
something else in different context in different cultures, in

107
00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:20.410
different regions uh on our planet. And this is

108
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.649
the the first uh difficulty when we talk about it

109
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.528
because we all think that we are talking about the

110
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.279
same phenomena, but maybe and the same classifications.

111
00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:35.450
And this is especially important for science because usually,

112
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:43.190
mm when we think about about race, we have

113
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.168
this strong intuition that there are some kind of universal

114
00:08:48.178 --> 00:08:50.960
classic racial classifications, right? Like uh people uh

115
00:08:50.969 --> 00:08:56.529
can be divided into blacks and whites or yellows or

116
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.139
um like this uh we we think about this historical

117
00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:05.288
classifications that there are like caucasians and, and negroids

118
00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:09.178
or something like that, you know, uh while

119
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:15.649
this is just one nara one narration about class narration

120
00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:18.250
, classifications and in some other like some places,

121
00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:22.788
there are other classifications. Another thing is that when

122
00:09:22.798 --> 00:09:28.558
thinking about race, we have so many stereotypes that

123
00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:39.500
are related to racist beliefs in races that it's difficult

124
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:43.808
to somehow abstract from them. So even when research

125
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.219
, like scientists are saying, OK, race is

126
00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:50.250
just a social construct, there are no biological human

127
00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:58.250
races. Uh bio um biologists agrees like population biologists

128
00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:01.678
agrees that there are no human races. Um But

129
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.389
maybe we will use some kind of uh Norac classifications

130
00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:09.090
in, for example, in forensic anthropology, but

131
00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:13.619
this is not a a biological race. We try

132
00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:16.609
to somehow relate, for example, to ancestry.

133
00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:20.950
But then what this ancestry means to people, especially

134
00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:26.469
if it's somehow related to this very universal uh classification

135
00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:31.639
that we all heard about like African Americans and whites

136
00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:33.250
, for example, those are those two major categories

137
00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:35.739
there, right? Or Asians as well. And

138
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:41.489
um, so if we, if we read a

139
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.950
, a study and people are writing about someone's ancestry

140
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.029
and this, um, this, this person or

141
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:56.029
, or mm, those, those reminds that are

142
00:10:56.038 --> 00:11:00.029
, that the researchers are trying to identify, are

143
00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:05.408
assigned to African Americans or whites. So what does

144
00:11:05.418 --> 00:11:09.529
it tell you even if they will later say that

145
00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:13.509
this is not a biological uh race, it is

146
00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.979
more of an ancestry and race is just a social

147
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.038
cultural project like a construct, right? You will

148
00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:24.989
still probably have this feeling that there is something biological

149
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.070
there, right? And uh yeah, and then

150
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.080
finally, um we have this problem that there are

151
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:39.038
still some people who really believe in some kind of

152
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:46.779
, so say the scientifical um theories or some kind

153
00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:54.750
of very politically motivated. Uh So the scientifical,

154
00:11:54.759 --> 00:12:00.729
hm hypothesis and beliefs about races and about some kind

155
00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:05.629
of differences between populations that are called races um that

156
00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:11.200
are used but for political reasons and for ideological reasons

157
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:18.359
to somehow shape our social reality, right? So

158
00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:24.119
uh to, to divide people to, you know

159
00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:28.058
, we see there that, that kind of um

160
00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:35.298
racist narration about different uh cultures about the different um

161
00:12:35.308 --> 00:12:39.399
nations that they are worse than others. Uh especially

162
00:12:39.408 --> 00:12:43.269
now when we have a war in Ukraine uh which

163
00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:50.058
was strongly um related to some kind of nationalist beliefs

164
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.840
of presented uh in, in Russia. At the

165
00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:58.229
same time, it was justified by Russia that they

166
00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:01.840
are fighting nationalism, right? And at the same

167
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:05.229
time, there is like a huge tension between Poland

168
00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:07.989
and Ukraine and all of those countries that have their

169
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.788
own historical um issues that somehow rem that are somehow

170
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.668
uh remaining racial or racial uh Karch and racist narrations

171
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.519
. So, um yeah, there is a huge

172
00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:31.349
cause and a huge mess and I really believe that

173
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.109
um maybe there is a good think to, to

174
00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:43.788
start like revising this concept and you ask if I

175
00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:46.979
believe that the race is a scientifical concept. So

176
00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:50.808
, so making, I already said a lot but

177
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:58.849
trying to somehow um briefly present my perspective here,

178
00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:03.750
I would say that definitely it does not because as

179
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:09.298
long as it is not strictly or somehow precisely defined

180
00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:11.428
in each study, we really don't know what that

181
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.750
means in particular. Um con without the context especially

182
00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:18.849
, but even in a particular context, it is

183
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:26.649
hard to uh somehow infer what researchers or just uh

184
00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:31.288
normally people think when they refer to race, what

185
00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:33.700
, what they would like to refer to actually.

186
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:43.009
Um And trying to like fro from the philosophical perspective

187
00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:46.109
, I really do believe like, I, I

188
00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:50.928
find the arguments uh very persuasive the, the arguments

189
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.580
that are saying that maybe there are no races and

190
00:14:54.590 --> 00:15:01.609
no um like the category of race as some kind

191
00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:09.529
of empty, empty notion that is referring to many

192
00:15:09.538 --> 00:15:11.619
different phenomena. At the same time, we could

193
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:13.519
say that it is very like we, we can

194
00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:16.320
understand it in a very pluralist way, right?

195
00:15:16.678 --> 00:15:20.320
Uh But maybe it would be more precise to talk

196
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:28.298
about racialized individuals and racialized groups because only by changing

197
00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:31.048
the the language here to more process one to more

198
00:15:31.058 --> 00:15:35.308
contextual one because we are rationalizing others or we are

199
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.889
racialized ourselves in some moment, right? And we

200
00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:43.779
can change it. It's something that is a very

201
00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:48.178
dynamic and not that static category. Race. OK

202
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.658
. I am that race or he is this race

203
00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:56.109
. But what about the fact that people are changing

204
00:15:56.119 --> 00:16:00.408
their racial identities? For example, what about the

205
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:04.690
fact that they are, they would be uh identified

206
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:11.308
as having a different race just by changing their uh

207
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.349
their country or something like that because in that country

208
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.029
there is a different a classification recognized by government,

209
00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:23.178
for example. So yeah, II I would say

210
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.969
that it is not the scientifical category and um and

211
00:16:27.979 --> 00:16:36.259
probably uh racialization is a much better concept. Oh

212
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:40.058
OK. So let's put a pin on that racialization

213
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.298
idea and also some of the other perhaps consequences that

214
00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:48.320
it might have in the domain of medicine. We'll

215
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.450
come back to that later on. I have a

216
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.298
few other questions before we get to that. But

217
00:16:53.308 --> 00:16:56.460
let me just ask you a follow up to what

218
00:16:56.469 --> 00:17:00.548
you said because there are many points that you mentioned

219
00:17:00.558 --> 00:17:03.039
there and many things that I could touch on.

220
00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:07.098
But let me just say that, uh, so

221
00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:12.130
on my show, at least since 2019, possibly

222
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.838
2020 I've had on the show, many anthropologists,

223
00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:22.500
geneticists and biologists, uh, with whom I talked

224
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:26.309
about race, what were their ideas about race and

225
00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:30.250
so on. And I mean, at least people

226
00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:33.779
that come from those three disciplines, anthropology, genetics

227
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:37.789
and anthropology, genetics and biology that I think are

228
00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:42.289
the most, the most well equipped to deal with

229
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:45.755
these questions and not a single one said that he

230
00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:49.334
, that he or she fought that race at any

231
00:17:49.344 --> 00:17:53.144
sort of scientific validity as a concept of it.

232
00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:56.295
So, but, but uh uh uh on the

233
00:17:56.305 --> 00:17:59.305
other hand, I guess that at least from uh

234
00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:03.910
let's say sociological perspective, we have to take the

235
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.799
category of race as a social construct or less seriously

236
00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:15.289
because it still has consequences in terms of social dynamics

237
00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:19.880
, how people think about people from other racial groups

238
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:25.098
and me some medical consequences as we're going to talk

239
00:18:25.108 --> 00:18:26.318
about later. Right? So, but basically I'm

240
00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:32.709
asking you if, even though scientifically speaking, I

241
00:18:32.719 --> 00:18:37.559
guess that very, very few people take race seriously

242
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:44.130
. Um in terms of uh how uh people establish

243
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.430
relationships in our societies, how they think about other

244
00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:51.189
groups of people and, and how certain groups of

245
00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:53.969
people are treated and so on. We should take

246
00:18:53.979 --> 00:19:00.390
it seriously. It has some sort of social reality

247
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.979
to it. Right. Um So basically, yes

248
00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:08.939
, like making things short. Um Yes, of

249
00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:14.630
course. I didn't want to say that there is

250
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.729
nothing like, um, a construct that is,

251
00:19:18.739 --> 00:19:25.160
that is cultural, that can be ascribed to people

252
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.059
and just by doing so it can change, like

253
00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:32.858
, shape their lives, for example, and shape

254
00:19:32.868 --> 00:19:37.539
their attitudes to themselves and to others. Of course

255
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.130
. um it, it has a lot of meaning

256
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.979
to be a racialized person. Like we have those

257
00:19:44.989 --> 00:19:51.650
arac identities. Uh And I really believe that in

258
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.449
a racist world, each person has some kind of

259
00:19:55.459 --> 00:19:59.289
a racial identity, of course, each grown up

260
00:19:59.328 --> 00:20:02.259
uh uh person because as a Children, we,

261
00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:07.578
we don't think about that kind of uh factors like

262
00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:12.390
that kind of problems. Uh So ethno racial identities

263
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.680
, as well as the whole racist structure of our

264
00:20:18.689 --> 00:20:23.848
rewards. So uh sys systemic racism and interpersonal racism

265
00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:26.390
. So all the interactions with other people who have

266
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.368
some kind of racist, who probably have some kind

267
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.068
of racist beliefs and racist biases even if they don't

268
00:20:34.078 --> 00:20:38.009
want to because, you know, uh we all

269
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:41.049
believe in some kind of stereotypes, for example,

270
00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:47.400
that, that, that govern our uh way of

271
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.150
thinking and, and behaviors, even if we want

272
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:59.209
to be 100% an anti racist and, and very

273
00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:04.789
inclusive. Yet there are some kind of um culturally

274
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:14.509
acquired uh and embodied uh stereotypes and beliefs that,

275
00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:18.229
that may somehow came up and affect us even if

276
00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:19.459
we don't know, even if we don't want to

277
00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:25.140
. Uh So when the category of race is used

278
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:32.338
in, for example, um sociology or uh I

279
00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:34.390
don't know, like some kind of cultural studies,

280
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:48.029
it, it is meaningful and also it usually refer

281
00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:52.199
to something that does exist that exists and that really

282
00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:56.989
is important to, to investigate, uh especially when

283
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.549
it comes to cultural studies. It's very important to

284
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:08.328
learn how racism and racial hierarchies uh shape human lives

285
00:22:08.338 --> 00:22:15.660
and all of that uh like the uh the social

286
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.180
structure, the, the social reality of our,

287
00:22:18.189 --> 00:22:25.880
of our world. But still, when we think

288
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.670
about them as about some kind of universal and objective

289
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.029
categories, even if socially constructed, then we have

290
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:40.049
a problem because we are forgetting that cultures differ.

291
00:22:41.219 --> 00:22:45.170
And this is the problem. I believe that because

292
00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:53.439
we hear this very common uh in philosophy would say

293
00:22:53.449 --> 00:22:57.979
like racial talk, um us, racial talk uh

294
00:22:57.989 --> 00:23:04.108
that is based on us ethno racial classification and their

295
00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:10.588
uh social situ situation, social context and economical context

296
00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:15.660
and all the historical context and geographical context that shaped

297
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.949
the, the situation in us and how race is

298
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.739
interpreted there. Uh Then is it is very easy

299
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:34.150
for, for older people to somehow um I don't

300
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.209
know um somehow believe that this is the, the

301
00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:48.588
way that like racial um divisions are shaped generally and

302
00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:52.140
that's it. But no it's not true. Like

303
00:23:52.479 --> 00:24:00.489
this is a very complex uh problem that may uh

304
00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:06.670
differ different communities in a way that they shaped their

305
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.838
uh as I already said, um how they shape

306
00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:14.049
their admiration uh Karch or uh you know, the

307
00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:19.430
privileges uh that are given to, to different populations

308
00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:23.858
and different uh diff different members of the those populations

309
00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:30.259
. So the problem is not the concept itself may

310
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:33.588
, maybe the problem is not the concept itself but

311
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.568
the fact that we think about it in a very

312
00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:44.108
, so I I will probably um mm sorry,

313
00:24:44.118 --> 00:24:47.108
iii I will say the same thing as I said

314
00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:48.989
before. So we think about it in a very

315
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.880
static and very uh universal and, and so essentialist

316
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:03.939
way and when we think about essentialist category, but

317
00:25:04.009 --> 00:25:07.890
about the category in a socialist way and that category

318
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:15.729
itself is somehow associated with essentialist beliefs about the race

319
00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:18.858
, then it's very easy to, to, you

320
00:25:18.868 --> 00:25:22.838
know, to, to skip from this point when

321
00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:27.229
we remember that we are talking about very contextual and

322
00:25:27.239 --> 00:25:33.709
very processable and very dynamic and diverse category that is

323
00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:41.029
uh sour um uh category construct took place when we

324
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:45.779
go back to this uh essentialist belief that there are

325
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:51.309
some kind of biological races. And yeah, and

326
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:56.969
the, the way we talk about it about race

327
00:25:56.368 --> 00:26:00.479
, the, the way how we describe it using

328
00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:04.858
certain words is is problematic and this is where uh

329
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:11.430
racialization probably works better again because it is a,

330
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:17.930
it is not uh like an object, you know

331
00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:22.640
, a, a verb, right? No,

332
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.140
I'm not very familiar with English grammar. Sorry.

333
00:26:26.689 --> 00:26:30.338
So I think it's a noun, right? Yeah

334
00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:33.939
. Yeah. So, yeah. So, um

335
00:26:33.949 --> 00:26:36.578
it is something that is happening, someone can do

336
00:26:36.588 --> 00:26:38.650
that. It's not, you know, this um

337
00:26:40.289 --> 00:26:41.519
this thing that is stable, that the thing,

338
00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:45.949
that thing that has some kind of ideal uh shape

339
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:49.509
or form that we can you know, check if

340
00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:52.199
, if you have this and this and that then

341
00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:56.250
OK, you, you are uh white or black

342
00:26:56.259 --> 00:27:00.318
. OK. But, but then le let's get

343
00:27:00.328 --> 00:27:03.098
into that already since you're mentioning it again. So

344
00:27:03.108 --> 00:27:07.588
what does racialization mean exactly? And how does would

345
00:27:07.598 --> 00:27:12.640
it differ exactly from the concept of race? So

346
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.380
the concept of radicalization it it, of course,

347
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:22.250
it differs uh from philosopher to philosopher, from social

348
00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:26.118
scientist to social scientist. So there are many different

349
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.949
definitions of radicalization. Um The way I understand it

350
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:42.259
is um is related to um very like evolutionary uh

351
00:27:44.348 --> 00:27:49.568
interpretation of metaphysics I would say. So it is

352
00:27:49.578 --> 00:27:56.809
it is uh related to um systems theory and systems

353
00:27:56.818 --> 00:28:03.088
biology. And the the process all metaphysics that usually

354
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:07.759
comes with this evolutionary biological, like this evolutionary metaphysics

355
00:28:07.769 --> 00:28:14.588
. And mhm And the fact that that kind of

356
00:28:14.598 --> 00:28:22.209
ontology which is multileveled or multisystem or that may be

357
00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:30.799
understood as somehow emergent. So uh not in that

358
00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:38.439
strictly reductionist way. Hm from that kind of perspective

359
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:45.868
, radicalization is a process or um many processes that

360
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:53.130
produce or that lead to um the belief that some

361
00:28:53.140 --> 00:29:00.529
person is uh representative of some kind of entity uh

362
00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:04.449
of, of some kind of group. Mm That

363
00:29:04.459 --> 00:29:11.189
is a major biological entity or human lineage uh that

364
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:15.469
was formed due to reproductive isolation. Uh And that

365
00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:19.789
the membership in this group is transmitted through some kind

366
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:29.009
of biological uh processes. So, um racialization,

367
00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:37.309
it's not about a question. Are races real do

368
00:29:37.318 --> 00:29:41.299
races exist? But this this about question, do

369
00:29:41.309 --> 00:29:45.318
we believe that they exist? And do we believe

370
00:29:45.328 --> 00:29:52.289
that someone is uh has a race? Mhm And

371
00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:56.199
this is the the uh the most important difference between

372
00:29:56.479 --> 00:30:00.039
uh race and racialization from my point of view,

373
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:04.239
of course. So we don't need to answer to

374
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:10.959
this question anymore. Like am I talking about only

375
00:30:10.969 --> 00:30:14.838
cultural construct or maybe political construct? Because we also

376
00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:18.539
have that kind of conversations uh discussions and philosophy of

377
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:21.049
race, right? So some people are saying this

378
00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:22.750
is only political construct and others are saying this is

379
00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:26.630
maybe only social and what are differences between political and

380
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:32.029
social contract constructs when it comes to the development of

381
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:34.509
the idea of race? So I don't need to

382
00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:37.098
answer to this question because for me, what is

383
00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:45.059
important is that some people identify with some construct,

384
00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:51.989
have those identities and what is the uh characterization of

385
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.640
those identities? So here most important mo most important

386
00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:03.848
thing is that it is processable. So I may

387
00:31:03.858 --> 00:31:08.368
have some kind of ad no racial identity in time

388
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.049
. T but in different contexts, I may change

389
00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:19.130
it or I may uh experience different aspects of racialization

390
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:26.130
in different contexts. For example, I may feel

391
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:33.949
like a person which is racialized uh as white when

392
00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:38.828
I'm like a privileged white person when I am in

393
00:31:38.838 --> 00:31:45.368
my country, uh like in Poland. Uh and

394
00:31:45.689 --> 00:31:52.848
when I help uh people who are so called illegal

395
00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:56.479
migrants in Poland. So, so people who are

396
00:31:56.489 --> 00:32:00.269
racialized as Muslims, for example, they may have

397
00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:02.588
even light skin, but if they are racialized as

398
00:32:02.598 --> 00:32:07.519
Muslims, they may face a lot of racism in

399
00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:10.390
Poland, right? A lot of racist aggression uh

400
00:32:10.989 --> 00:32:15.588
and discrimination. So in that particular context, I

401
00:32:15.598 --> 00:32:22.250
may feel like a very privileged person. But if

402
00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:28.140
I just go to Britain, for example, and

403
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.180
I will move from Poland to Britain or to France

404
00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:38.170
or to other country, which is um more um

405
00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:45.170
which, which racialize Eastern Europeans as that lower race

406
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:51.358
historically. Uh Then I may face some kind of

407
00:32:51.368 --> 00:32:55.229
some kind of a no racial aggression and discrimination and

408
00:32:55.239 --> 00:33:01.219
I may lose this white privilege. Uh This identity

409
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:07.430
that makes me uh more white. Uh w when

410
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.459
I may help someone else in my country who is

411
00:33:10.469 --> 00:33:14.939
racialized, right? I know that it sounds a

412
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:22.838
bit chaotic but uh what I mean is we can

413
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:28.680
change those identities, but also we can this racial

414
00:33:28.689 --> 00:33:32.420
identity and the, the fact that someone is somehow

415
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:37.368
racialized, it has some kind of state of racialization

416
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.019
, I would say uh it occurs on many different

417
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:49.759
levels. So you may be racialized on the level

418
00:33:49.769 --> 00:33:57.160
of enviro environment differently than racialized on the level of

419
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:06.650
some kind of a sociopolitical mm Processes that, mm

420
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.860
I don't know, recognize your uh identity uh as

421
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:14.369
something else because I don't know, some law changed

422
00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:17.059
and now you are uh you are not a white

423
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.559
but you are now a Latina, right? That

424
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.199
kind of changes happened in our cultures a lot of

425
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:27.699
time, many times. Sorry. Um You may

426
00:34:27.708 --> 00:34:31.458
also feel differently than how people see you, right

427
00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:37.340
? So it's also something else to be rationalized by

428
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:39.659
others and to have this admiration, identity and to

429
00:34:39.668 --> 00:34:45.699
rationalize yourself. Uh and in all of those uh

430
00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:53.570
context um that kind of um the, the the

431
00:34:53.878 --> 00:34:59.099
organization is something that is happening and is changing.

432
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:05.099
So, um I'm not sure if I explained it

433
00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:08.070
enough, but um this is something that from my

434
00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:13.929
point of view uh really differs this static category of

435
00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:19.239
race and racialization. Hm. Yeah. Yeah,

436
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.309
I, I mean, I guess that uh if

437
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.159
we approach it on theologically, I guess that uh

438
00:35:24.168 --> 00:35:29.579
race would be more of like a based on a

439
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:35.329
substance ontology. There is a more essentialist category and

440
00:35:35.628 --> 00:35:40.599
racialization would be more based on uh on a process

441
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:44.869
on. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah

442
00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.110
, you see, I, I do research on

443
00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:49.269
it but, but you explained it better than me

444
00:35:49.429 --> 00:35:51.889
. It's, it's probably because my English and the

445
00:35:51.898 --> 00:35:53.289
fact that I was teaching all day, all day

446
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.039
long. No, no, no, no worries

447
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.269
about that. But le let me ask you now

448
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.719
. And do you think that the category or the

449
00:36:00.728 --> 00:36:07.148
concept, the concept of ethnicity fares any better scientifically

450
00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:09.030
speaking? Because, uh, I mean, as

451
00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:13.378
we'd raise, I guess that when people use the

452
00:36:13.389 --> 00:36:16.809
term ethnicity, not necessarily in science specifically, but

453
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:22.978
just in society, they might mean different things in

454
00:36:22.989 --> 00:36:30.869
different contexts, right? So ethnicity is another problematic

455
00:36:30.878 --> 00:36:36.320
term because again, people are using it in as

456
00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:40.619
a very different notions. So before you said that

457
00:36:40.628 --> 00:36:45.139
most genetics, like all people who work on genetics

458
00:36:45.148 --> 00:36:50.860
, uh and biology generally said that races, human

459
00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:57.059
races like biologically uh understood they don't exist. OK

460
00:36:57.228 --> 00:37:00.869
. But still race and ethnicity are categories that are

461
00:37:00.878 --> 00:37:05.878
used in biomedical research and genetic research, genomic research

462
00:37:05.889 --> 00:37:10.619
, et cetera, right? And similarly ethnicity and

463
00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:17.958
this is the funniest thing. So basically the the

464
00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:22.228
my first understanding of ethnicity is that it is more

465
00:37:22.668 --> 00:37:30.699
uh it is more cultural phenomena because usually we talk

466
00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:37.909
about ethnicity um in relation to language, culture,

467
00:37:37.918 --> 00:37:43.949
nationality, right? However, it it's not always

468
00:37:43.958 --> 00:37:49.659
happening, especially when we look more closely to to

469
00:37:49.668 --> 00:37:54.389
science. So OK, maybe in soc sociology or

470
00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:59.199
something like that, it would be understood as strictly

471
00:37:59.208 --> 00:38:02.110
social phenomena. But at the same time there was

472
00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:07.188
this uh study in 2021 I suppose, or maybe

473
00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:13.889
22 uh about how the usage of uh categories such

474
00:38:13.898 --> 00:38:19.969
as race, ethnicity and ancestry changed or developed in

475
00:38:19.978 --> 00:38:25.519
genetics. Um So in that study, it was

476
00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:32.530
shown that researchers use ethnicity much more than race at

477
00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:37.909
the moment. Mm For many reasons, for example

478
00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:44.418
, um they want to avoid this very controversial uh

479
00:38:44.429 --> 00:38:47.628
category of race. So they prefer to uh use

480
00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:53.409
ethnicity instead of it or maybe they are from UK

481
00:38:53.599 --> 00:39:00.329
. So they uh the term ray or ethnicity is

482
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.458
, is uh very often replaced with. Um uh

483
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.809
so, so the term race is replaced with ethnicity

484
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:12.909
even if in their like uh caucus, right?

485
00:39:12.918 --> 00:39:16.128
So, so they don't gather racial data, they

486
00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:21.110
just gather and, and use eth ethnicity data.

487
00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:29.409
Um And uh in such a situation, we have

488
00:39:29.418 --> 00:39:36.760
this, those re those studies are in biomedicine,

489
00:39:36.769 --> 00:39:44.070
like in genetics, genomics that still recognize uh hm

490
00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:50.938
population like uh differences between populations on the basis of

491
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.550
a, a category of race and ethnicity or only

492
00:39:53.559 --> 00:40:01.378
ethnicity even. So, then if ethnicity has something

493
00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:07.199
in common with some kind of biological differences between people

494
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:16.188
. And additionally, and it was also um researched

495
00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:19.929
like it, it, I even described this um

496
00:40:19.938 --> 00:40:22.898
such situations in one of my papers. I if

497
00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:30.260
additionally, we apply uh th that uh us racial

498
00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:34.938
talk to, to that to those uh uh this

499
00:40:34.949 --> 00:40:38.389
term ethnicity. So if we will understand ethnicity as

500
00:40:38.398 --> 00:40:45.010
some kind of proxy for racial classifications. Then there

501
00:40:45.019 --> 00:40:50.878
is a huge mess here because instead of trying to

502
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.989
the biologist or the centralized race, we are doing

503
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.760
completely opposite. So we biologist and centralize ethnicity.

504
00:41:05.168 --> 00:41:08.418
There is a lot of papers where you can find

505
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:15.929
information about um genetical differences, like in some kind

506
00:41:15.938 --> 00:41:19.800
of um some kind of gene gene polymorphisms, for

507
00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:24.570
example, uh between populations and those populations are uh

508
00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:34.878
described uh with the relation to us uh Arac classifications

509
00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:40.369
. So as African Americans, white, um native

510
00:41:40.378 --> 00:41:45.820
Americans, uh Asians, etcetera. So what then

511
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:50.898
what that kind of ethnicity mean? Of course,

512
00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:52.469
in other studies, it would be much more precise

513
00:41:52.478 --> 00:41:58.719
because for example, they will use more demograph understanding

514
00:41:58.728 --> 00:42:01.579
of ethnicity. So it will be uh closely related

515
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:07.648
to people, people's uh place of living or something

516
00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:12.489
like that. And they would say not whites,

517
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:16.250
but for example, poles uh instead of whites.

518
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:22.708
Mhm. Um Yet still, what does it mean

519
00:42:22.719 --> 00:42:25.668
when it comes to my genes? Right? That

520
00:42:25.708 --> 00:42:28.938
I, when, when they call me just a

521
00:42:28.949 --> 00:42:32.869
poll we also have now I I saw a discussion

522
00:42:34.199 --> 00:42:38.909
uh about a new proposition for FDA at no racial

523
00:42:38.918 --> 00:42:44.918
classification in USA uh or O MD at no racial

524
00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:47.599
classifications like some changes and revisions and that they are

525
00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:54.489
proposing and if you answer the questions uh uh to

526
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.989
in their mm in their new forms, then you

527
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
, for example, if you are white so called

528
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.128
white, then you can choose, for example,

529
00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:08.809
white pole or uh I don't know white German.

530
00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:13.228
But if you are pole and not white, there

531
00:43:13.239 --> 00:43:15.110
is no category for you. But I know that

532
00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:17.978
there are some poles that are not white like they

533
00:43:17.989 --> 00:43:21.208
have, they don't have a white skin, right

534
00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:22.550
? So, yeah, so this is another problem

535
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:30.280
here. Uh Yeah. Yeah. So perhaps let

536
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:36.320
me ask you a somewhat broader question because uh we've

537
00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:40.079
already seen here and also again mentioning some other interviews

538
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.860
that I've had over the course of the last few

539
00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:47.179
years with geneticists, anthropologists and biologists on the show

540
00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:50.539
and people can go back and check them out.

541
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.019
Some of them have even raised on the title so

542
00:43:53.139 --> 00:43:57.059
you can, you can get there easily. Um

543
00:43:57.918 --> 00:44:01.938
uh There are so race and ethnicity are very messy

544
00:44:01.949 --> 00:44:08.300
concepts and when people try to study, for example

545
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:14.148
, differences between human populations, sometimes they use those

546
00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:16.409
concepts, other times they do not use them.

547
00:44:16.418 --> 00:44:20.269
But still do, do you think that there might

548
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:28.809
be some issues associated with assuming differences between human populations

549
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.969
when studying them? I mean, expecting there to

550
00:44:30.978 --> 00:44:37.550
be uh differences between human population. I believe that

551
00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:42.918
there are human differences between human populations. Um like

552
00:44:42.929 --> 00:44:45.769
our populations are very variant, like there is a

553
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:53.349
huge variety between people, right? Um And of

554
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.760
course, it would be silly to say that there

555
00:44:55.769 --> 00:45:02.119
are no genetical differences between people or there are no

556
00:45:02.128 --> 00:45:05.688
I don't know, like other differences between people.

557
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.849
There are those differences but race and ethnicity are a

558
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:15.260
very shitty categories to, to be used to,

559
00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:22.010
to study those differences. Um For all of those

560
00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:27.619
reasons I talked about also like usually race and ethnicity

561
00:45:27.628 --> 00:45:30.239
, like ethno racial data in, in, in

562
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:38.909
us are gathered um by uh information about people's um

563
00:45:38.918 --> 00:45:42.679
self ID, ID, identification, right? So

564
00:45:42.688 --> 00:45:49.378
their self identity, but what does self identity,

565
00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:52.458
what, what it tells us about their genes?

566
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.659
It is difficult to say, right? And again

567
00:45:57.668 --> 00:45:59.708
, what the fact that I live in Poland.

568
00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:05.349
Uh So I am appalled, say about my genes

569
00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:13.889
, something probably. But we know that our researchers

570
00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:15.539
uh our research, our studies, our science may

571
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:20.500
can be and should be much more precise. And

572
00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:24.510
this is something that may sound funny. But um

573
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.168
like in this part, like in my part of

574
00:46:29.179 --> 00:46:30.909
the world. So, so Eastern Europe, uh

575
00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:35.418
people moved a lot because for example, because of

576
00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:37.610
World War Two, right? And a part of

577
00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:40.750
my family is uh from via, so a place

578
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.780
in uh contemporary Ukraine and they had to, most

579
00:46:45.789 --> 00:46:50.570
of them were killed uh by nationalists and some of

580
00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:54.989
them escaped to Poland, other parts from my family

581
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.449
, like other ancestors uh in my family could come

582
00:47:00.458 --> 00:47:05.829
from some kind of um eee even more, more

583
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.849
from the west and from east. Sorry. So

584
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.478
uh my genetic, my, my DNA and my

585
00:47:15.489 --> 00:47:21.708
genome is a bit mixed. So why it matters

586
00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:24.369
and why, why I am talking about it first

587
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:30.188
. Um Because for example, when I was visiting

588
00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:35.239
a surgeon um because I had some problems with my

589
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.719
jaw. He said that I have a mongoloid skull

590
00:47:38.849 --> 00:47:44.309
. Uh and it sounds a bit weird. Uh

591
00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:46.780
The the the surgeon said, like look at my

592
00:47:46.789 --> 00:47:51.840
head scans, right? RT G scans. Mm

593
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.208
He, he, he said, OK, you

594
00:47:55.219 --> 00:47:59.168
cannot spot it when you, when you see your

595
00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:00.898
face, your skin. But when I see your

596
00:48:00.909 --> 00:48:06.878
skull, yeah, it's definitely Mongoloid said. All

597
00:48:06.889 --> 00:48:08.918
right. Um Yeah, and that's true. I

598
00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:13.699
have probably we have some kind of Asian ancestors and

599
00:48:13.708 --> 00:48:16.708
sometimes it really doesn't matter but sometimes it does.

600
00:48:17.139 --> 00:48:20.438
And for example, if we, if we think

601
00:48:20.449 --> 00:48:23.619
about medicine and biomedical research, it is very important

602
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.760
. And uh and in this context, I usually

603
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:34.898
uh talk about uh one situation from my life again

604
00:48:34.909 --> 00:48:37.438
, like especially from my mother's life to be honest

605
00:48:37.728 --> 00:48:42.228
. Um So she had some kind of um um

606
00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:47.110
some something grow on her jaw again and her dentist

607
00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:51.590
uh sent her to a surgeon. Uh they did

608
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:57.208
some kind of uh tests and said that probably it

609
00:48:57.219 --> 00:49:00.409
is a cancer like a serious cancer. Uh but

610
00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:01.750
they have to do a biopsy because they are not

611
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.449
sure they cannot recognize it. And she was like

612
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:08.579
, afraid she's dying for about three months. Uh

613
00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:14.889
Everyone was saying we are not sure we cannot interpret

614
00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:20.360
your uh results. Uh we have some doubts but

615
00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:23.289
probably this serious and she didn't know what's happening with

616
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.978
her. As long as one of her doctors sent

617
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:30.918
her uh medical data, health data to some kind

618
00:49:30.929 --> 00:49:35.398
of international conference. And in Poland, we don't

619
00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:38.128
gather and use erac categories when it comes to uh

620
00:49:38.148 --> 00:49:43.079
health data. So there was no information about her

621
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:47.599
, the color of her skin. Uh and as

622
00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:52.050
, as fast as her skin was invisible to those

623
00:49:52.059 --> 00:49:54.559
people, they only had her scans and the information

624
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:59.559
like the data, someone quickly said, OK,

625
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.219
this is nothing, this is nothing serious. This

626
00:50:01.228 --> 00:50:06.500
is just this uh uh Asian thing that many Asians

627
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.978
has, but it's, it's not serious. Uh

628
00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:10.079
So, so she should, she should be fine

629
00:50:10.739 --> 00:50:15.320
. So she had to lose her skin like metaphorically

630
00:50:15.878 --> 00:50:20.869
and lose her race to be di di diagnosed,

631
00:50:20.878 --> 00:50:28.128
right? And that kind of mistakes in diagnosis may

632
00:50:28.139 --> 00:50:37.958
happen uh repeatedly when we believe that race, especially

633
00:50:37.969 --> 00:50:42.559
someone's skin color and someone's identity may be a good

634
00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:49.519
proxy uh for some kind of genetical polymorphisms. Sorry

635
00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.949
in our like there is no gene for race.

636
00:50:52.688 --> 00:50:55.188
Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's the thing

637
00:50:55.199 --> 00:50:57.869
, right? Because I was just going to ask

638
00:50:57.878 --> 00:51:01.110
you about that, what in terms of health information

639
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:07.148
, what are some of the consequences that we having

640
00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:08.320
or we, I mean, I'm saying that in

641
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:14.938
particular countries it works like that people have uh racialized

642
00:51:14.949 --> 00:51:19.039
health information and what, what are some of the

643
00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:22.760
biggest consequences of the the the negative consequences. Of

644
00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:27.438
course. So again, this is a very problematic

645
00:51:27.449 --> 00:51:32.519
issue like a very problematic uh question because from the

646
00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:37.869
one side, there is a huge gap in knowledge

647
00:51:37.878 --> 00:51:42.329
about the whole minorities, right? And in the

648
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:49.639
history of science, most research was done on white

649
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:55.239
privilege, middle class and young men uh because they

650
00:51:55.250 --> 00:52:00.969
studied in those universities, universities where the research was

651
00:52:00.978 --> 00:52:05.510
done. Of course. So for example, in

652
00:52:05.519 --> 00:52:10.869
neuroscience, until the beginning of uh 21st century,

653
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.489
hm most scans like uh F MRI s and everything

654
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:22.369
was done on, on, on white uh middle

655
00:52:22.378 --> 00:52:28.159
class men around 2022 or something like that. And

656
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.898
it was, it was a huge issue. So

657
00:52:32.909 --> 00:52:38.458
we started to gather a data about other populations,

658
00:52:38.469 --> 00:52:45.340
about other cultures, like pe representatives from other cultures

659
00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:51.280
uh about representatives of groups that were um um were

660
00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:55.628
excluded from, from uh research before. And this

661
00:52:55.639 --> 00:53:01.208
is great because we need to know more about uh

662
00:53:02.648 --> 00:53:09.119
body uh woman bodies about um bodies of people who

663
00:53:09.128 --> 00:53:15.159
experienced racism, uh bodies of people who, who

664
00:53:15.168 --> 00:53:17.628
have totally different experiences than ours, how it affects

665
00:53:17.639 --> 00:53:25.699
them, uh how different geographical um um environment or

666
00:53:25.708 --> 00:53:30.369
economical environment changes and affects us. Uh We,

667
00:53:30.378 --> 00:53:32.889
we need that knowledge, right? We also need

668
00:53:32.898 --> 00:53:38.139
the knowledge about how we respond to different psychological environments

669
00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:44.099
or how we should design cars for, for people

670
00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:45.938
who are not a standard person, right? And

671
00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:51.829
the standard person is always white. So um in

672
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.219
the mail, of course, so this is great

673
00:53:54.228 --> 00:53:59.059
that we started to, to somehow worked with this

674
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:04.829
problem of a huge knowledge gap about other others,

675
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:14.340
generally. However, um when we are understanding those

676
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:19.679
differences through those categories of race and ethnicity, um

677
00:54:19.688 --> 00:54:23.320
again, we are doing this mistake that we keep

678
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:29.280
thinking with essentialist and racist classes, I would say

679
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:35.949
. Um so why it is important for uh uh

680
00:54:35.978 --> 00:54:37.978
to, to talk about those issues uh when it

681
00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:42.300
comes to health care and biomedical research, especially healthcare

682
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:45.079
, because you asked me about medical care, right

683
00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:52.969
? It's uh it is because first um this is

684
00:54:52.978 --> 00:55:00.409
uh something that is uh making racist beliefs stronger.

685
00:55:00.469 --> 00:55:05.409
So for example, if we, even if we

686
00:55:05.418 --> 00:55:07.898
have a very good uh intuition, like very good

687
00:55:07.909 --> 00:55:13.199
motivations, we want to, we don't want to

688
00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:15.429
be color blind, right? Uh And we want

689
00:55:15.438 --> 00:55:22.369
to um fully acknowledge that we have uh patients that

690
00:55:22.378 --> 00:55:30.458
are from minorities and that may have some kind of

691
00:55:30.469 --> 00:55:32.320
medical issues because of that, for example, because

692
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:37.320
of the effect of um uh racist discrimination on their

693
00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:44.099
health. Um If we just in fear that it

694
00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:50.458
is possible from the color of their skin, then

695
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:59.688
we are usually um as uh thinking about it in

696
00:55:59.699 --> 00:56:05.820
a way that is somehow racist just because we applied

697
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:13.769
it all this framework or connected with racial um discrimination

698
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.679
and it includes uh worse access to education and living

699
00:56:17.688 --> 00:56:25.168
in poverty and maybe some totally racist stuff like lower

700
00:56:25.179 --> 00:56:31.429
IQ um and things like that. But why,

701
00:56:31.438 --> 00:56:36.500
like, maybe this is a person who is twice

702
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.429
as rich and uh you know, like wealthy and

703
00:56:40.438 --> 00:56:46.989
economically privileged um than 20% of white people in states

704
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.869
or something like that, who of course have their

705
00:56:49.878 --> 00:56:55.708
privilege as well. But we need to learn how

706
00:56:55.719 --> 00:57:02.739
to uh recognize those aspects of our identity that tell

707
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:08.969
us something about the discrimination that we could um experience

708
00:57:08.978 --> 00:57:15.909
. So when we try to um research do research

709
00:57:15.918 --> 00:57:21.070
about the impact of racism and racialization on, on

710
00:57:21.079 --> 00:57:23.510
people's health, we need to be able to recognize

711
00:57:23.519 --> 00:57:29.079
on about which level of racialization we are talking about

712
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.840
. Are we talking about lower access to health care

713
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:39.369
in terms of um like space that divides people from

714
00:57:39.378 --> 00:57:43.789
hospitals, like geographically speaking, like very, very

715
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.519
material thing or are we talking about some kind of

716
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:55.699
uh epigen uh historical problems that the members of certain

717
00:57:55.949 --> 00:58:01.239
communities faced their, their ancestors? Um So some

718
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:06.478
kind of traumas could be passed through generations or maybe

719
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:12.269
we are talking about the fact that uh someone uh

720
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:15.530
won't get some kind of, I don't know uh

721
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:21.039
uh won't get a scholarship or won't be published in

722
00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:23.668
the scientific journal because he or she is from,

723
00:58:23.679 --> 00:58:29.610
I don't know, Mongolia and people usually don't treat

724
00:58:29.628 --> 00:58:32.070
scientists who are not from core countries as seriously as

725
00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:35.530
others. So, Yeah, we, we just

726
00:58:35.539 --> 00:58:37.878
need to recognize about what we are talking about,

727
00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:43.208
right? And when we just use race and ethnicity

728
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:45.579
, there are just two broad concepts. They,

729
00:58:45.869 --> 00:58:51.559
they re relate to so many different ways of discrimination

730
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.769
, to so many different experiences, to so many

731
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.969
different things that, that no one knows about what

732
00:58:59.989 --> 00:59:02.389
they are talking. Right? And let, let

733
00:59:02.398 --> 00:59:07.969
me ask you a very specific uh related question to

734
00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:12.579
medicine and health care because I mean, by using

735
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:15.250
categories like race and ethnicity. But I guess even

736
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.780
more so race and medicine, one thing that people

737
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:23.619
do is that they study the prevalence of certain diseases

738
00:59:23.628 --> 00:59:29.139
across different races, right? And uh together with

739
00:59:29.148 --> 00:59:31.019
that, usually I'm not, I'm not saying that

740
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:36.099
always, but usually comes the assumption that because they

741
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.550
find uh there, that there's a difference in prevalence

742
00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:43.260
of certain diseases across races, there must be a

743
00:59:43.269 --> 00:59:46.909
genetic basis to, to those differences, right?

744
00:59:46.918 --> 00:59:52.789
And but isn't that also somewhat problematic? Uh I

745
00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.059
, I don't know if you agree with what I'm

746
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:57.668
about to say or not, but I've also talked

747
00:59:57.679 --> 00:60:00.969
with a few sociologists on the show. And actually

748
00:60:00.978 --> 00:60:02.789
, for example, in the US, uh they

749
00:60:02.800 --> 00:60:07.489
criticize some of the ways that people in medicine deal

750
00:60:07.500 --> 00:60:14.239
with health information, racialized health information because uh they

751
00:60:14.250 --> 00:60:17.949
say that uh perhaps there are some diseases that have

752
00:60:17.958 --> 00:60:23.280
higher prevalence in uh black people. Uh Black Americans

753
00:60:23.289 --> 00:60:29.728
, not because of their race or anything genetic,

754
00:60:29.898 --> 00:60:31.269
but because, uh, I mean, if you

755
00:60:31.280 --> 00:60:37.929
look at the socio-economic data, usually, uh,

756
00:60:37.978 --> 00:60:45.219
african-americans fare worse in terms of their socio-economic status than

757
00:60:45.599 --> 00:60:47.949
, uh, whites in America. And so some

758
00:60:47.958 --> 00:60:52.619
of that might be explained not by genes or genetics

759
00:60:52.628 --> 00:60:57.418
, but by the, by them being poor,

760
00:60:57.429 --> 00:61:00.329
their socio-economic status and all of the things they are

761
00:61:00.340 --> 00:61:07.094
exposed to while poor that perhaps other, uh,

762
00:61:07.103 --> 00:61:12.375
o, other groups in America are not as exposed

763
00:61:12.385 --> 00:61:14.135
to as they are. And I mean, I'm

764
00:61:14.144 --> 00:61:16.965
not saying with all of these deaths, some diseases

765
00:61:16.974 --> 00:61:20.914
uh do not have any genetic basis at all.

766
00:61:20.925 --> 00:61:23.750
Of course, some of them have. But still

767
00:61:23.760 --> 00:61:25.260
, I mean, there are, there are these

768
00:61:25.269 --> 00:61:30.219
complications that derived from the fact that uh there are

769
00:61:30.228 --> 00:61:36.809
certain instances where we use racialized information in medicine.

770
00:61:37.090 --> 00:61:39.260
Yes. So yeah, I I was talking about

771
00:61:39.269 --> 00:61:44.958
it actually, like there are some kind of differences

772
00:61:44.969 --> 00:61:51.878
that uh are caused by social, cultural or economic

773
00:61:51.889 --> 00:61:59.128
and environmental factors generally uh that may be spotted and

774
00:61:59.139 --> 00:62:05.829
recognized as racial differences. But they um are there

775
00:62:05.840 --> 00:62:07.889
, there was this uh great sentence that I really

776
00:62:07.898 --> 00:62:14.148
loved uh uh And that was pretty popular during COVID

777
00:62:14.159 --> 00:62:21.570
pandemic. Uh when researchers try to criticize the biolog

778
00:62:21.579 --> 00:62:27.570
organization of uh differences when it comes to deaths uh

779
00:62:28.329 --> 00:62:34.030
of COVID between different communities. And they use this

780
00:62:34.039 --> 00:62:37.590
uh a phrase that it's not a matter of race

781
00:62:37.599 --> 00:62:39.809
, it is a matter of racism. So,

782
00:62:40.110 --> 00:62:45.280
yeah, there are many differences between com like many

783
00:62:45.289 --> 00:62:50.708
health differences in between communities and populations that are caused

784
00:62:50.719 --> 00:62:57.958
by uh racism and social inequalities. However, there

785
00:62:57.969 --> 00:63:00.168
are also some kind of differences between populations that are

786
00:63:00.179 --> 00:63:02.628
caused by our genes. But yet, as I

787
00:63:02.639 --> 00:63:07.148
said before, category of race and ethnicity are not

788
00:63:07.159 --> 00:63:10.728
perfect categories to be used as a proxy for those

789
00:63:10.739 --> 00:63:15.668
differences as well as our features such as skin color

790
00:63:15.679 --> 00:63:20.478
, right? Like our skin color may be important

791
00:63:20.489 --> 00:63:25.929
if we want to study how we uh actually mm

792
00:63:27.878 --> 00:63:31.809
gain vitamin D, right? Because this is or

793
00:63:31.909 --> 00:63:37.369
perhaps for example, differences in uh in, in

794
00:63:37.378 --> 00:63:40.929
developing skin cancer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:63:40.938 --> 00:63:47.199
So let's use a skin color when we are researching

796
00:63:47.208 --> 00:63:50.878
something that is connected to skin color, right?

797
00:63:51.398 --> 00:63:54.139
But even then the category of race and ethnicity say

798
00:63:54.148 --> 00:63:57.820
us nothing. We just need to use, you

799
00:63:57.829 --> 00:64:01.780
know, some kind of uh gradient that is related

800
00:64:01.789 --> 00:64:10.139
to colors because I'm not sure if uh if I'm

801
00:64:10.148 --> 00:64:13.039
right, but I would say that many people who

802
00:64:13.050 --> 00:64:15.659
are white have a lighter skin and darker skin,

803
00:64:15.668 --> 00:64:20.168
like my skin may get very dark uh during summer

804
00:64:20.320 --> 00:64:24.648
. But I know some people who just go outside

805
00:64:24.659 --> 00:64:28.208
and get burned in like 10 seconds, right?

806
00:64:28.219 --> 00:64:31.389
And there probably is some difference here as well that

807
00:64:31.398 --> 00:64:35.228
should be researched. So, so yeah, if

808
00:64:35.239 --> 00:64:40.458
we, if we think that our patient, for

809
00:64:40.469 --> 00:64:44.019
example, or or if we think that in our

810
00:64:44.030 --> 00:64:49.179
study, something may be uh caused by a difference

811
00:64:49.188 --> 00:64:54.309
in skin color, then focus on that. If

812
00:64:54.320 --> 00:64:59.019
we think that some kind of differences between populations or

813
00:64:59.030 --> 00:65:02.739
, or communities may be caused by socio economic factors

814
00:65:03.110 --> 00:65:10.199
, then we should use some kind of uh measures

815
00:65:10.820 --> 00:65:18.719
like frameworks that measure uh socioeconomical uh mm differences and

816
00:65:18.728 --> 00:65:23.378
vulnerability, vulnerability. I'm sorry, I cannot pronounce

817
00:65:23.389 --> 00:65:27.059
this word. Vulnerability. Yeah. Yeah. This

818
00:65:27.070 --> 00:65:30.300
one. So if, if we think that some

819
00:65:30.309 --> 00:65:35.969
differences may be caused by uh some kind of differences

820
00:65:35.978 --> 00:65:41.539
in health literacy or diet, we should look at

821
00:65:41.550 --> 00:65:46.510
those but not race in general because all whites don't

822
00:65:46.519 --> 00:65:48.679
eat the same food and all blacks don't eat the

823
00:65:48.688 --> 00:65:53.570
same food, right? So uh we just need

824
00:65:53.579 --> 00:65:56.809
to be more precise about what we are researching.

825
00:65:57.039 --> 00:65:58.889
And this is what I'm trying to say that in

826
00:65:58.898 --> 00:66:02.199
some cases, a no racial identity may be very

827
00:66:02.208 --> 00:66:05.389
important if we want to me, like if we

828
00:66:05.398 --> 00:66:12.010
want to investigate, for example, how people experience

829
00:66:12.019 --> 00:66:17.010
stress caused by their identity or how they, how

830
00:66:17.019 --> 00:66:23.128
does the level of stress differs between them and between

831
00:66:23.139 --> 00:66:27.530
people who self-identity differently? Like as a minority,

832
00:66:27.889 --> 00:66:31.360
for example, when they face uh police uh policemen

833
00:66:31.469 --> 00:66:34.228
, a police. Uh Yeah, just a police

834
00:66:34.458 --> 00:66:39.398
. Uh and it is um uh it is uh

835
00:66:39.409 --> 00:66:43.409
it was studied by many researchers that usually people who

836
00:66:43.418 --> 00:66:48.019
are um representatives of minorities. Of course, usually

837
00:66:48.030 --> 00:66:51.000
in those, in those studies, it is written

838
00:66:51.010 --> 00:66:56.510
that black communities and African Americans have a higher level

839
00:66:56.519 --> 00:67:00.780
of stress w while facing police than whites. And

840
00:67:00.789 --> 00:67:03.378
this is totally normal because of course they are discriminated

841
00:67:03.389 --> 00:67:06.719
and they have to face this violence um on a

842
00:67:06.728 --> 00:67:13.530
day or daily basis. But then, um,

843
00:67:13.539 --> 00:67:16.679
so, so then, um their, their identity

844
00:67:16.688 --> 00:67:20.699
is important, it is relevant in this particular context

845
00:67:20.929 --> 00:67:23.898
, but it's not relevant in a, in a

846
00:67:23.909 --> 00:67:28.769
context of our genome. Right. Right. A

847
00:67:28.780 --> 00:67:30.978
and so, I mean, basically these ideas that

848
00:67:30.989 --> 00:67:34.978
you're putting on the table now about looking at what's

849
00:67:34.989 --> 00:67:41.929
relevant in each particular case is what perhaps a post

850
00:67:42.050 --> 00:67:45.079
racial kind of medicine would look like. Right.

851
00:67:45.090 --> 00:67:47.869
Um Maybe, yes, like we, we just

852
00:67:47.878 --> 00:67:51.860
need to be, I, I love precision.

853
00:67:51.989 --> 00:67:56.639
Probably, maybe because uh I'm a philosopher. Uh

854
00:67:56.648 --> 00:68:00.599
and I wonder what concept means? Maybe because I'm

855
00:68:00.610 --> 00:68:04.478
autistic and I love precision even more. Uh But

856
00:68:05.030 --> 00:68:11.599
hm I think that in science to make it functional

857
00:68:11.610 --> 00:68:15.289
and to, to, to functionally communicate with other

858
00:68:15.300 --> 00:68:17.079
scientists, not to, not to just create a

859
00:68:17.088 --> 00:68:21.899
huge mess like conceptual mess as um as it is

860
00:68:21.909 --> 00:68:26.569
with, with the case of race and ethnicity and

861
00:68:26.579 --> 00:68:29.289
their use in biomedical research, we need to be

862
00:68:29.298 --> 00:68:31.338
precise but to do so, we need to be

863
00:68:31.350 --> 00:68:38.349
aware that each of us has a lot of beliefs

864
00:68:38.358 --> 00:68:43.389
that are sometimes even unconscious. Uh a lot of

865
00:68:43.398 --> 00:68:48.369
ontological methodological beliefs that we just acquired through our cultural

866
00:68:48.378 --> 00:68:55.500
training, education from our scientific community even. And

867
00:68:55.838 --> 00:69:00.278
we usually don't question them. But if we,

868
00:69:00.288 --> 00:69:03.957
if we just use some kind of categories without any

869
00:69:05.069 --> 00:69:09.359
asking any questions, especially if they are those such

870
00:69:09.369 --> 00:69:15.619
a controversial and, and so powerful categories. Um

871
00:69:15.939 --> 00:69:19.628
Then it is, it is um we need to

872
00:69:19.640 --> 00:69:23.659
, we need to ask those questions, what are

873
00:69:23.750 --> 00:69:26.229
we, what kind of differences we are looking for

874
00:69:27.140 --> 00:69:30.199
? Um What we are researching, what do we

875
00:69:30.208 --> 00:69:36.007
want to say? Because even by like the only

876
00:69:36.019 --> 00:69:41.797
by designing our research in one way or another,

877
00:69:42.479 --> 00:69:46.298
uh we change our results and and we we can

878
00:69:46.310 --> 00:69:51.390
affect it. So there is this uh um this

879
00:69:51.399 --> 00:69:57.458
quote that what we put into our, you know

880
00:69:57.470 --> 00:70:00.338
, research data, for example, it is what

881
00:70:00.350 --> 00:70:04.819
we get in our results. So do we need

882
00:70:04.829 --> 00:70:09.930
to put a racial data everywhere or those categories everywhere

883
00:70:09.939 --> 00:70:13.298
. This is another question that from my perspective is

884
00:70:13.310 --> 00:70:18.500
very important like in in USA uh some institutions that

885
00:70:18.509 --> 00:70:25.220
finance uh biomedical research require scientists to use gutter and

886
00:70:25.229 --> 00:70:29.939
use erac categories in their studies. So they actually

887
00:70:29.949 --> 00:70:34.750
need to use race and ethnicity as one uh of

888
00:70:34.759 --> 00:70:39.270
reference classes or subgroups in their research, right?

889
00:70:39.560 --> 00:70:44.199
But it it is not a neutral, it is

890
00:70:44.208 --> 00:70:48.369
somehow it may affect what they are researching, how

891
00:70:48.378 --> 00:70:50.390
they are doing it and what kind of results they

892
00:70:50.399 --> 00:70:54.930
are getting out of the the research. So yeah

893
00:70:54.939 --> 00:71:00.239
, the the awareness of like methodological and conceptual awareness

894
00:71:00.250 --> 00:71:01.729
in science is very important from my point of view

895
00:71:03.699 --> 00:71:09.850
. So let's change topics completely now, and getting

896
00:71:09.859 --> 00:71:13.350
into the last part of our interview, let's talk

897
00:71:13.359 --> 00:71:17.000
about a completely different topic that is human robot interaction

898
00:71:17.009 --> 00:71:20.668
because you also have some interesting work on that.

899
00:71:20.680 --> 00:71:23.930
I read a few papers of yours on that.

900
00:71:23.939 --> 00:71:26.720
And uh I would like to ask you because when

901
00:71:26.729 --> 00:71:29.020
it comes to human robot interaction, I mean,

902
00:71:29.029 --> 00:71:30.759
there are many different aspects of it that we could

903
00:71:30.770 --> 00:71:33.439
talk about here. But I would actually like to

904
00:71:33.449 --> 00:71:40.359
ask you about empathy specifically. So uh this empathy

905
00:71:40.369 --> 00:71:44.359
apply in this context of human robot interaction. I

906
00:71:44.369 --> 00:71:46.458
mean, is it even possible for humans to feel

907
00:71:46.470 --> 00:71:53.529
empathy for robots? So yeah, I think so

908
00:71:54.048 --> 00:71:56.878
. Um there is uh there are some kind of

909
00:71:56.890 --> 00:72:01.500
studies showing that those uh areas of our brains are

910
00:72:01.509 --> 00:72:09.048
similarly activated when we also report feeling empathy toward robots

911
00:72:09.588 --> 00:72:12.930
. As when we report feeling empathy with people,

912
00:72:13.458 --> 00:72:18.088
uh people, people feel that empathy like they,

913
00:72:18.100 --> 00:72:24.270
they can describe it as similarly to a situation when

914
00:72:24.279 --> 00:72:29.180
we feel empathy to some kind of cartoons. Uh

915
00:72:29.189 --> 00:72:33.109
when we, while we are watching movies or you

916
00:72:33.119 --> 00:72:36.319
know, when you have uh plaques in your wall

917
00:72:36.329 --> 00:72:40.458
for electricity, electricity, sometimes they look so sad

918
00:72:40.470 --> 00:72:43.789
or so happy like when they looks like they have

919
00:72:43.798 --> 00:72:45.548
eyes and a face. So we have, we

920
00:72:45.560 --> 00:72:53.649
are those weird animals uh that have this tendency to

921
00:72:53.659 --> 00:72:59.439
anthropomorphize other beings and other entities. Uh uh And

922
00:72:59.779 --> 00:73:05.369
if those entities have some kind of features that makes

923
00:73:05.378 --> 00:73:10.208
it easier for us to anthropomorphize them then, yeah

924
00:73:10.220 --> 00:73:13.739
, we easily do so. A a and,

925
00:73:13.750 --> 00:73:16.759
but what would be perhaps from the perspective of philosophy

926
00:73:16.770 --> 00:73:19.180
of science? And I guess that in this particular

927
00:73:19.189 --> 00:73:24.579
case, the specific areas of philosophy of science that

928
00:73:24.588 --> 00:73:28.298
would apply here would be something like philosophy of cognitive

929
00:73:28.310 --> 00:73:31.250
science, neuroscience, psychology, uh disciplines like that

930
00:73:31.708 --> 00:73:36.039
. What are some of the explanations out there for

931
00:73:36.048 --> 00:73:42.569
why we might feel empathy for robots? Ok.

932
00:73:42.579 --> 00:73:46.180
So, hm, this is a problem that I

933
00:73:46.500 --> 00:73:54.369
investigated um as a result of my previous research on

934
00:73:54.378 --> 00:73:58.628
other uh race effect uh and using category of race

935
00:73:58.640 --> 00:74:02.958
in neuroscience because I had to write something about robot

936
00:74:02.970 --> 00:74:06.878
be robots being uh a part of the team where

937
00:74:06.890 --> 00:74:09.548
the P I asked me, OK, you should

938
00:74:09.560 --> 00:74:11.509
do so. So, you know, you don't

939
00:74:11.520 --> 00:74:13.899
have a job, you have to, you have

940
00:74:13.909 --> 00:74:16.628
to uh take what they give you. So,

941
00:74:16.640 --> 00:74:23.298
so yeah, uh I had to switch and after

942
00:74:23.310 --> 00:74:27.739
reading a lot of papers about um uh human robot

943
00:74:27.750 --> 00:74:30.649
interactions, I just spotted that in many cases they

944
00:74:30.659 --> 00:74:34.439
refer to empathy. Um And as I already told

945
00:74:34.449 --> 00:74:36.918
you, I love precision, but I saw that

946
00:74:36.930 --> 00:74:41.199
this term, this notion empathy is used differently and

947
00:74:41.208 --> 00:74:45.159
understood differently in almost every, every study. And

948
00:74:45.168 --> 00:74:48.199
that's OK. We can agree that sometimes when some

949
00:74:48.208 --> 00:74:53.489
kind of concepts uh even if they are, even

950
00:74:53.500 --> 00:74:55.338
if no one knows what they mean, they are

951
00:74:55.350 --> 00:74:58.449
used, but they works, that's fine. That's

952
00:74:58.458 --> 00:75:02.259
fair enough. But at the same time, I

953
00:75:02.270 --> 00:75:09.259
put it that first, those interactions uh and our

954
00:75:09.270 --> 00:75:15.588
ability to empathize with um robotic agents depends on factors

955
00:75:15.600 --> 00:75:21.909
that are very similar to those that shape um inter

956
00:75:21.918 --> 00:75:30.529
uh like intergroup um relations between, for example,

957
00:75:30.539 --> 00:75:34.970
the representatives of different um ethno racial groups. So

958
00:75:35.369 --> 00:75:45.659
um that many different factors may shape our attitudes towards

959
00:75:45.668 --> 00:75:49.000
robots and uh they may affect the, the way

960
00:75:49.009 --> 00:75:51.979
we empathize with them or if we empathize with them

961
00:75:51.989 --> 00:75:55.509
or how much, how is the level of this

962
00:75:55.520 --> 00:76:00.989
empathy? Uh And the third thing was that I

963
00:76:00.000 --> 00:76:05.140
also a as a philosopher, I know that many

964
00:76:05.609 --> 00:76:11.430
, many of us are very conservative in a way

965
00:76:11.989 --> 00:76:16.149
. Um We understand such a basic uh concept such

966
00:76:16.159 --> 00:76:19.958
as society. So for example, when I start

967
00:76:19.970 --> 00:76:24.560
, uh when I wrote my first uh paper about

968
00:76:24.569 --> 00:76:28.500
empathy in human interactions, and I send it to

969
00:76:28.509 --> 00:76:31.779
some Polish journal. Uh I get a review that

970
00:76:31.789 --> 00:76:35.298
it is uh nonsense to talk about any kind of

971
00:76:35.310 --> 00:76:40.909
social relations with robots because robots cannot be social agents

972
00:76:40.918 --> 00:76:44.899
, right? Because social agents need to be conscious

973
00:76:44.909 --> 00:76:46.259
. Uh and they need to have some kind of

974
00:76:46.270 --> 00:76:49.970
social intentions, et cetera. But yeah, but

975
00:76:49.979 --> 00:76:53.819
at the same time, our social ontology is changing

976
00:76:54.168 --> 00:76:56.850
when, when our culture is changing and it is

977
00:76:56.859 --> 00:77:00.338
shaped by technology, right? And we are thinking

978
00:77:00.350 --> 00:77:05.458
about animals in terms of personhood. So why not

979
00:77:05.470 --> 00:77:10.079
to think about robots as some kind of partners in

980
00:77:10.088 --> 00:77:14.739
our social reality, especially that it is more about

981
00:77:14.810 --> 00:77:19.619
how we interpret them uh than if they like if

982
00:77:19.628 --> 00:77:23.779
robots feel empathy because of course, at this stage

983
00:77:23.789 --> 00:77:27.609
of our technology, it's, yeah, it's a

984
00:77:27.619 --> 00:77:30.850
very abstract question. Um My question was more about

985
00:77:31.750 --> 00:77:39.859
is it um useful or is it justified to use

986
00:77:39.869 --> 00:77:42.729
the term from methodological point of view to use the

987
00:77:42.739 --> 00:77:48.039
term empathy while studying interaction between people and robots.

988
00:77:48.619 --> 00:77:51.899
But and yes, it is from my point of

989
00:77:51.909 --> 00:77:56.720
view, it is, it is uh it is

990
00:77:56.729 --> 00:78:01.509
very um it there are many arguments supporting the the

991
00:78:01.520 --> 00:78:05.909
thesis that that empathy is something that that can be

992
00:78:05.949 --> 00:78:13.949
uh successfully used uh in human robot interaction studies.

993
00:78:14.409 --> 00:78:15.430
Uh First of all, as I already said,

994
00:78:16.640 --> 00:78:24.390
people report feeling empathy, then neuro head scans and

995
00:78:24.399 --> 00:78:29.159
F MRI studies show similar levels of activity in similar

996
00:78:29.539 --> 00:78:34.399
brain areas that uh yeah, then like the most

997
00:78:34.409 --> 00:78:41.759
important thing is that s the function of social robots

998
00:78:41.770 --> 00:78:46.128
is to somehow get into social interaction with their users

999
00:78:46.140 --> 00:78:51.259
, right? For example, to become a substitute

1000
00:78:51.270 --> 00:78:58.409
of human relations when it comes to other people in

1001
00:78:58.418 --> 00:79:03.069
houses, when they feel very lonely. Uh It's

1002
00:79:03.079 --> 00:79:05.600
it's getting more and more popular even here in my

1003
00:79:05.609 --> 00:79:11.668
city in Pozna uh in in some uh hospitals or

1004
00:79:11.680 --> 00:79:16.529
uh places where, where with many elder people and

1005
00:79:16.539 --> 00:79:21.458
we have those uh small um se not Sequels but

1006
00:79:23.029 --> 00:79:28.970
um some white like sea creature, which is super

1007
00:79:28.979 --> 00:79:33.850
sweet and cool. Like, like the one that

1008
00:79:33.859 --> 00:79:36.770
is playing in a ball in a circus, like

1009
00:79:36.779 --> 00:79:42.418
in a very stereotype, stereotypical uh dolphins, not

1010
00:79:42.430 --> 00:79:46.918
dolphins. Um, never mind. Sorry. Uh

1011
00:79:48.918 --> 00:79:53.600
In po it's Foer. 00, yeah. Oh

1012
00:79:53.609 --> 00:79:55.789
my God. I, I'm missing the name.

1013
00:79:57.369 --> 00:80:02.048
I'm also missing. Uh it's, it's a sea

1014
00:80:02.109 --> 00:80:06.409
, it's not sea lion or is it? Yeah

1015
00:80:08.310 --> 00:80:10.759
, I don't know why. Look, I'm also

1016
00:80:10.770 --> 00:80:12.649
not sure, at least at the moment, I'm

1017
00:80:12.659 --> 00:80:15.418
not sure if it's sea lion or not. So

1018
00:80:15.470 --> 00:80:20.039
sorry people uh excuse us. We are. Yeah

1019
00:80:20.048 --> 00:80:23.609
, I, I usually, I usually do not

1020
00:80:23.819 --> 00:80:27.079
talk, I usually do not talk about these animals

1021
00:80:27.088 --> 00:80:30.060
in this. Yeah, me neither. So,

1022
00:80:30.100 --> 00:80:31.458
so yeah. Uh they are used in many that

1023
00:80:31.470 --> 00:80:34.588
kind of situations where as a substitute of, of

1024
00:80:34.600 --> 00:80:43.199
human interactions like social interactions and it is totally relevant

1025
00:80:43.208 --> 00:80:46.479
because our societies are getting older and, and we

1026
00:80:46.489 --> 00:80:49.279
have to do something about it right? There is

1027
00:80:49.289 --> 00:80:53.979
more and more older people in our communities that,

1028
00:80:53.989 --> 00:80:56.878
that feel this loneliness and it affects their mental and

1029
00:80:56.890 --> 00:81:04.810
physical health. So um yeah, why um why

1030
00:81:04.819 --> 00:81:10.208
this is a question? Like why bother? OK

1031
00:81:10.220 --> 00:81:13.239
. There are those studies that use this term empathy

1032
00:81:13.250 --> 00:81:15.668
, people report it. So why, why it's

1033
00:81:15.680 --> 00:81:19.779
, it's something to, to, to talk about

1034
00:81:20.088 --> 00:81:24.000
, right? Even if some philosopher said it's no

1035
00:81:24.009 --> 00:81:26.989
, it's a nonsense because robots cannot be social.

1036
00:81:27.180 --> 00:81:29.338
It is just one person in Poland, right?

1037
00:81:29.750 --> 00:81:33.060
Uh uh Yeah, but, but I thought that

1038
00:81:33.069 --> 00:81:41.338
maybe um again, it would be much um more

1039
00:81:41.350 --> 00:81:45.470
functional and much more useful if we try to somehow

1040
00:81:45.479 --> 00:81:51.529
recognize how this empathy thing is understood in that kind

1041
00:81:51.539 --> 00:81:55.088
of research. And what does it really mean?

1042
00:81:55.100 --> 00:82:00.708
And is it the same empathy as we feel uh

1043
00:82:00.720 --> 00:82:03.310
when we have a contact with people or not,

1044
00:82:03.619 --> 00:82:09.199
usually empathy is understood as some kind of relation,

1045
00:82:09.208 --> 00:82:14.789
like something that you feel because someone else felt right

1046
00:82:15.039 --> 00:82:18.220
is like a coil, right? Like uh like

1047
00:82:18.229 --> 00:82:24.699
some kind of effect because someone else felt something there

1048
00:82:24.708 --> 00:82:30.588
are those um theories about mirror neurons and things like

1049
00:82:30.600 --> 00:82:33.250
that. It's not that important in this context,

1050
00:82:33.548 --> 00:82:38.229
but what is important is all right. So how

1051
00:82:38.239 --> 00:82:43.470
can we empathize with some something that doesn't even feel

1052
00:82:43.479 --> 00:82:50.119
right? Um Why, why should we research something

1053
00:82:50.128 --> 00:82:54.359
like this? Uh First as I said, because

1054
00:82:54.859 --> 00:82:59.128
this is the function of those mechanisms, they sh

1055
00:82:59.140 --> 00:83:02.180
in some cases, they should make us feel empathy

1056
00:83:02.229 --> 00:83:05.520
, empathetic. But in other cases, in other

1057
00:83:05.529 --> 00:83:10.579
situations, we should also know how to stop this

1058
00:83:11.640 --> 00:83:17.020
. Um this uh some kind of uh empathic relation

1059
00:83:17.100 --> 00:83:25.259
because it might be uh unfunctional or unuseful. For

1060
00:83:25.270 --> 00:83:28.298
example, as in the case of military robots,

1061
00:83:28.588 --> 00:83:33.949
when they should just b um some kind of like

1062
00:83:33.958 --> 00:83:41.899
they just support human operators and and uh human um

1063
00:83:43.449 --> 00:83:46.859
forces on a on the front line. But if

1064
00:83:46.869 --> 00:83:50.890
those people who work with those robots feel empathy towards

1065
00:83:50.899 --> 00:83:55.640
them, then their life may be endangered and there

1066
00:83:55.649 --> 00:83:58.500
are some cases of such situations, right? So

1067
00:83:58.588 --> 00:84:01.439
we have to know, we, first of all

1068
00:84:01.449 --> 00:84:05.930
, we can learn a lot about ourselves about our

1069
00:84:05.939 --> 00:84:12.140
ability to empathize with others by studying human robot interactions

1070
00:84:12.439 --> 00:84:14.668
. Because it's much easier for example, to,

1071
00:84:15.329 --> 00:84:17.979
to repeat some kind of experiments with robots than to

1072
00:84:17.989 --> 00:84:21.930
repeat them with people to somehow I don't know,

1073
00:84:23.298 --> 00:84:29.479
to check how we uh uh rep replay or like

1074
00:84:29.489 --> 00:84:36.489
how we um react to uh when we see robots

1075
00:84:36.500 --> 00:84:41.310
being heard, then how we react, seeing people

1076
00:84:41.319 --> 00:84:44.168
being hurt, right? So yeah, we can

1077
00:84:44.180 --> 00:84:47.529
learn a lot about empathy in people like, you

1078
00:84:47.539 --> 00:84:51.229
know, uh by, by that kind of research

1079
00:84:51.239 --> 00:84:54.798
. And I think it's fascinating also, I think

1080
00:84:54.810 --> 00:84:59.298
it's fascinating how we understand empathy. Maybe it's not

1081
00:84:59.310 --> 00:85:02.640
something very like substantial, maybe there is a,

1082
00:85:03.489 --> 00:85:11.470
it is more uh moral relational thing. And there

1083
00:85:11.479 --> 00:85:16.470
are that kind of interpretations of relations between robots and

1084
00:85:16.479 --> 00:85:20.338
people that this is a matter of relation. And

1085
00:85:20.350 --> 00:85:25.489
it doesn't really matter if robot answer to us with

1086
00:85:25.500 --> 00:85:28.789
the real feelings, it's more a matter of what

1087
00:85:28.798 --> 00:85:32.548
is happening, which was between human, like uh

1088
00:85:32.560 --> 00:85:38.548
be between human and robotic agent. And I think

1089
00:85:38.560 --> 00:85:41.789
when it comes to social robots, especially the uh

1090
00:85:41.798 --> 00:85:44.140
to the, when it comes to those who,

1091
00:85:44.208 --> 00:85:46.569
who could work in health care, for example,

1092
00:85:47.168 --> 00:85:53.449
um the this question about this relation and how to

1093
00:85:53.458 --> 00:85:58.668
design this relation, how we should design the the

1094
00:85:58.680 --> 00:86:01.048
look of the robot, its name its uh its

1095
00:86:01.060 --> 00:86:05.208
voice because all of the those little details matter when

1096
00:86:05.220 --> 00:86:10.329
it comes to interactions with others because we may feel

1097
00:86:10.338 --> 00:86:12.949
more familiar with them or less familiar, we may

1098
00:86:12.958 --> 00:86:16.708
feel endangered or, or, or not by someone

1099
00:86:16.720 --> 00:86:20.878
who, who is so different than us or,

1100
00:86:20.958 --> 00:86:25.289
or, or too, too alike as us.

1101
00:86:26.140 --> 00:86:30.890
So trying to, to answer to the question is

1102
00:86:30.899 --> 00:86:38.329
the real empathy between in those interactions? Mm I

1103
00:86:38.338 --> 00:86:41.708
understood that. OK. It's there are there are

1104
00:86:41.720 --> 00:86:45.338
there are really more interesting questions there, like what

1105
00:86:45.350 --> 00:86:48.859
kind of factors shape this relation, how we can

1106
00:86:48.869 --> 00:86:55.529
change it in which situations it is good to somehow

1107
00:86:55.600 --> 00:87:00.699
heighten this level of empathy towards robots in which we

1108
00:87:00.708 --> 00:87:03.810
should somehow lower it and how it can change our

1109
00:87:03.819 --> 00:87:10.729
society as a whole. Mm If we will use

1110
00:87:10.739 --> 00:87:14.918
that kind of manipulations also, what kind of dangerous

1111
00:87:14.930 --> 00:87:20.878
comes with a manipulation uh with our empathetic reactions to

1112
00:87:20.890 --> 00:87:25.759
robots? We can easily imagine that some kind of

1113
00:87:25.770 --> 00:87:30.168
very cute puppy like robots will ask us to for

1114
00:87:30.180 --> 00:87:33.418
example, will be will be sold as the toys

1115
00:87:33.430 --> 00:87:40.689
and ask our Children to to buy them more um

1116
00:87:41.048 --> 00:87:45.899
more I don't know to like toys or clothes or

1117
00:87:45.909 --> 00:87:49.750
other kind of stuff uh or some kind of applications

1118
00:87:49.939 --> 00:87:54.369
. And by doing those cute faces like from uh

1119
00:87:54.600 --> 00:87:59.759
Pixar movies, they will just manipulate our reactions and

1120
00:87:59.770 --> 00:88:04.039
make us feel uh pretty, you know, vulnerable

1121
00:88:04.048 --> 00:88:06.140
to, to, to what they ask for,

1122
00:88:06.149 --> 00:88:12.640
especially if they will create relations with the the youngest

1123
00:88:12.649 --> 00:88:15.310
Children, for example, right. So yeah,

1124
00:88:15.319 --> 00:88:16.479
there, there are a lot of questions here that

1125
00:88:16.489 --> 00:88:20.520
are very interesting from my point of view and and

1126
00:88:20.529 --> 00:88:26.189
empathy is just a yeah, the question about empathy

1127
00:88:26.199 --> 00:88:30.009
is just a starting question here. Probably. No

1128
00:88:30.020 --> 00:88:31.588
, that that is all very interesting and I guess

1129
00:88:31.600 --> 00:88:35.189
uh just uh and this probably will be my last

1130
00:88:35.199 --> 00:88:39.770
question. But uh you mentioned something at a certain

1131
00:88:39.779 --> 00:88:44.640
point there, you mentioned uh the relational aspect that

1132
00:88:44.649 --> 00:88:47.798
perhaps many people question that we are really able to

1133
00:88:47.810 --> 00:88:55.180
establish some sort of relationship with robots. But actually

1134
00:88:56.079 --> 00:88:58.378
, I mean, there are people out there that

1135
00:88:58.390 --> 00:89:05.259
report uh experiencing a sort of relational thing, right

1136
00:89:05.270 --> 00:89:09.298
? With uh with robots, like for example,

1137
00:89:09.310 --> 00:89:13.458
social robots and now and then you hear it also

1138
00:89:13.470 --> 00:89:16.439
applied to sex robots, for example, so that

1139
00:89:16.449 --> 00:89:20.259
that's something that we also have to consider. It's

1140
00:89:20.270 --> 00:89:26.789
not just because robots might not be able at least

1141
00:89:26.798 --> 00:89:29.390
at this stage. And I'm not sure if they

1142
00:89:29.399 --> 00:89:31.859
ever will be able to do that, to feel

1143
00:89:31.979 --> 00:89:35.659
something about us to have for there to be some

1144
00:89:35.668 --> 00:89:40.895
sort of let's say emotional reciprocity or something along those

1145
00:89:40.904 --> 00:89:46.043
lines that people uh do not sometimes think about uh

1146
00:89:46.055 --> 00:89:51.345
or uh think about the their robots, the robots

1147
00:89:51.354 --> 00:89:57.145
they use or interact with certain ways as having a

1148
00:89:57.154 --> 00:90:02.458
relationship with them, right? Um Yeah, like

1149
00:90:02.470 --> 00:90:06.060
this is happening all the time when people fall,

1150
00:90:06.069 --> 00:90:11.329
fell in love with uh robots, for example,

1151
00:90:11.350 --> 00:90:15.378
or robotic dolls. Uh those sexual robots, uh

1152
00:90:15.430 --> 00:90:25.458
There is maybe more um radical form uh of such

1153
00:90:25.659 --> 00:90:31.020
a situation when people suffer from something called object ofilia

1154
00:90:31.029 --> 00:90:33.449
and they fell in love in objects. So for

1155
00:90:33.458 --> 00:90:36.140
example, there's this story about women who fell in

1156
00:90:36.149 --> 00:90:40.239
love with Eiffel Tower, right? Or, or

1157
00:90:40.250 --> 00:90:43.689
things like that. Uh But when it comes to

1158
00:90:43.699 --> 00:90:49.869
, to social robots, uh mm The question is

1159
00:90:49.878 --> 00:90:54.729
how we define emotions and how we define relations and

1160
00:90:54.859 --> 00:90:58.369
what really matters to us, right? Can we

1161
00:90:58.378 --> 00:91:03.399
say that we feel sad because something happened to Robert

1162
00:91:04.338 --> 00:91:08.509
? Um Yes, of course, we can feel

1163
00:91:08.520 --> 00:91:12.229
sad in such a situation. There are examples of

1164
00:91:12.239 --> 00:91:15.619
those uh movies from Boston dynamics, right? When

1165
00:91:15.869 --> 00:91:18.539
where people kick robots that are, are very,

1166
00:91:18.789 --> 00:91:23.220
that move in a very biological way and have this

1167
00:91:23.229 --> 00:91:28.048
animal like shape. So many people report that uh

1168
00:91:28.060 --> 00:91:31.479
feeling empathy those to those to those creatures, creatures

1169
00:91:31.489 --> 00:91:35.759
mechanisms. And they even um there was even this

1170
00:91:35.770 --> 00:91:41.088
website with the petition stop uh robot abuse and things

1171
00:91:41.100 --> 00:91:44.140
like that. So yes, of course, it

1172
00:91:44.149 --> 00:91:46.319
is similar to our human interaction from my perspective,

1173
00:91:46.329 --> 00:91:55.430
like I don't know if people who I know who

1174
00:91:55.439 --> 00:92:00.350
I trust and who I take care for are not

1175
00:92:00.359 --> 00:92:03.020
, for example, psychopaths and just don't manipulate me

1176
00:92:03.029 --> 00:92:08.399
, right? Um I don't know if people who

1177
00:92:08.409 --> 00:92:12.338
pretend to be interested in my, uh, well

1178
00:92:12.350 --> 00:92:15.069
, being really are, um, if I go

1179
00:92:15.079 --> 00:92:17.859
to a shop, people are nice and they are

1180
00:92:17.869 --> 00:92:23.810
smiling, smiling. Uh, and I usually reply

1181
00:92:23.819 --> 00:92:26.079
with a smile. Right. But is it a

1182
00:92:26.088 --> 00:92:29.588
true relation? They are getting money for it and

1183
00:92:29.600 --> 00:92:32.250
maybe they are frustrating and thinking about, I don't

1184
00:92:32.259 --> 00:92:34.378
know, putting a knife in my back. Right

1185
00:92:34.399 --> 00:92:38.430
. How can I know? Yeah, I guess

1186
00:92:38.439 --> 00:92:40.970
, I guess that, I guess, I guess

1187
00:92:40.979 --> 00:92:43.729
that what you're alluding to there is the fact that

1188
00:92:43.739 --> 00:92:45.029
, ok, so when it comes to robots,

1189
00:92:45.039 --> 00:92:48.810
perhaps there's nothing there, at least on their side

1190
00:92:48.819 --> 00:92:53.958
psychologically, but sometimes when it comes to humans themselves

1191
00:92:54.350 --> 00:92:57.979
, uh there can be something there but it might

1192
00:92:57.989 --> 00:93:00.319
be deceitful sometimes. And so, I mean,

1193
00:93:00.329 --> 00:93:04.189
the things we attribute to other people uh might not

1194
00:93:04.199 --> 00:93:08.640
correspond to. Um, no, I, I

1195
00:93:08.649 --> 00:93:13.520
wanted to say that, um, does it really

1196
00:93:13.529 --> 00:93:17.500
matter if robots are responding with the same kind of

1197
00:93:17.509 --> 00:93:24.609
like something similar um for us, for our society

1198
00:93:24.619 --> 00:93:27.009
at this stage, right, at the stage of

1199
00:93:27.020 --> 00:93:30.588
uh of uh development, technical development and social development

1200
00:93:31.088 --> 00:93:34.619
. Of course, we can theorize about feeling robots

1201
00:93:34.628 --> 00:93:43.470
in the future, but we know so little about

1202
00:93:44.208 --> 00:93:48.890
our own reactions and emotions and we have so many

1203
00:93:48.899 --> 00:94:00.479
issues with peoples and their relations the to that having

1204
00:94:00.489 --> 00:94:03.958
those robots and being able to investigate some of those

1205
00:94:03.970 --> 00:94:09.159
questions by looking at them and maybe also to co

1206
00:94:09.298 --> 00:94:11.970
shape and, and answer to some of the needs

1207
00:94:11.979 --> 00:94:16.319
of people with the use of robots. Uh this

1208
00:94:16.329 --> 00:94:19.009
is relevant and, and how we can do it

1209
00:94:19.298 --> 00:94:27.958
by looking at those um at those relations. Yeah

1210
00:94:27.970 --> 00:94:30.798
, in a relational way understood as a, in

1211
00:94:30.819 --> 00:94:36.199
a, in a way as proposed by um Damiano

1212
00:94:36.489 --> 00:94:40.128
and Da Michel, for example. So in terms

1213
00:94:40.140 --> 00:94:46.399
of some kind of emergent um phenomena, we have

1214
00:94:46.409 --> 00:94:50.739
action and reaction and, and the direction of the

1215
00:94:50.750 --> 00:94:57.319
robot is affecting us. And it is a complex

1216
00:94:57.329 --> 00:95:01.939
way of, you know, like um some kind

1217
00:95:01.949 --> 00:95:10.069
of uh biological uh behaviors, something new is emerging

1218
00:95:10.079 --> 00:95:13.810
. And this uh this, this new thing is

1219
00:95:13.819 --> 00:95:18.958
uh probably mo and 100% more important to us because

1220
00:95:18.970 --> 00:95:25.539
we are this conscious uh and intentional uh partner of

1221
00:95:25.548 --> 00:95:30.100
this, this interaction. And, and yeah,

1222
00:95:30.109 --> 00:95:31.689
and this is, this is what is crucial here

1223
00:95:32.100 --> 00:95:40.208
that whatever robot do and can I I'm not gonna

1224
00:95:40.220 --> 00:95:42.619
say feel because of course, it is a nonsense

1225
00:95:42.628 --> 00:95:53.079
but whatever it the robot and process maybe uh it

1226
00:95:53.088 --> 00:95:56.100
is not that important at this moment, right?

1227
00:95:56.338 --> 00:96:00.418
When, when we think about human robot interactions,

1228
00:96:00.430 --> 00:96:02.829
it is important when we think about robot rights and

1229
00:96:02.838 --> 00:96:09.279
like question like that kind of questions. But but

1230
00:96:09.289 --> 00:96:14.149
when we think about the development of our society and

1231
00:96:14.159 --> 00:96:17.449
our knowledge about ourselves and our society, I believe

1232
00:96:17.458 --> 00:96:25.088
that um there are concepts of empathy and emotions that

1233
00:96:25.100 --> 00:96:30.869
are much more interesting than just saying robots cannot empathize

1234
00:96:30.939 --> 00:96:33.109
, they cannot feel. So we cannot empathize with

1235
00:96:33.119 --> 00:96:38.128
them because this won't be a real empathy. So

1236
00:96:38.140 --> 00:96:41.259
you are, you are all diseased like you are

1237
00:96:41.270 --> 00:96:45.458
all lying to yourself. You cannot have those feelings

1238
00:96:45.470 --> 00:96:47.509
and if you think you have those feelings, yeah

1239
00:96:47.520 --> 00:96:50.588
, it is not true, right? This is

1240
00:96:50.600 --> 00:96:57.039
very uncreative way of, of talking about the that

1241
00:96:57.048 --> 00:96:59.579
that kind of problems from my perspective. It's,

1242
00:96:59.588 --> 00:97:01.298
it's easy to say you are lying to yourself.

1243
00:97:01.789 --> 00:97:05.890
It's much more interesting to say maybe there is something

1244
00:97:05.899 --> 00:97:10.128
here that is happening and we have to investigate this

1245
00:97:10.500 --> 00:97:13.770
again process, right? Um Yeah, I love

1246
00:97:13.779 --> 00:97:18.649
the process while thinking about relations and entities and uh

1247
00:97:18.918 --> 00:97:23.529
about our environment and, and I think it,

1248
00:97:23.539 --> 00:97:29.548
it makes um my life as a researcher mu much

1249
00:97:29.560 --> 00:97:31.628
more exciting than if I would just stuck with those

1250
00:97:31.640 --> 00:97:36.270
conservative uh and very again, very stable and essentialist

1251
00:97:36.279 --> 00:97:43.048
categories. Uh Because probably as you see that um

1252
00:97:43.489 --> 00:97:46.319
my way of thinking about using category of race in

1253
00:97:46.329 --> 00:97:51.270
biomedical research and empathy here is somehow similar like how

1254
00:97:51.279 --> 00:97:55.850
to maybe revise it, understand it and precise it

1255
00:97:55.859 --> 00:98:00.850
to make it more useful and and more appropriate,

1256
00:98:00.859 --> 00:98:04.350
maybe. Mhm For scientifical use. No. Yeah

1257
00:98:04.359 --> 00:98:08.600
, that, that makes for a very interesting parallel

1258
00:98:08.609 --> 00:98:11.060
here. Uh and connects very well. I guess

1259
00:98:11.069 --> 00:98:15.470
our prior discussion about race and ethnicity with these discussion

1260
00:98:15.479 --> 00:98:20.989
about empathy applied to human robot interaction. So Johan

1261
00:98:21.000 --> 00:98:25.109
uh I think that perhaps this is a good point

1262
00:98:25.149 --> 00:98:27.759
to end on to wrap up our interview on.

1263
00:98:27.770 --> 00:98:30.539
So just before we go, would you like to

1264
00:98:30.548 --> 00:98:32.140
tell people where they can find you and your work

1265
00:98:32.149 --> 00:98:35.829
on the internet? Oh, yeah, of course

1266
00:98:35.970 --> 00:98:38.850
, I'm not prepared for that. But, um

1267
00:98:38.859 --> 00:98:42.079
, it's very easy to find me on Twitter or

1268
00:98:42.088 --> 00:98:45.628
Research Gate or uh other sources. I also have

1269
00:98:45.640 --> 00:98:50.229
my website. Uh I don't remember the address right

1270
00:98:50.239 --> 00:98:54.560
now. Uh However, if you look for Yona

1271
00:98:54.569 --> 00:98:58.520
Carolina Malinovsky on the Twitter or research guide or uh

1272
00:98:58.529 --> 00:99:01.759
my university uh website, there is a link to

1273
00:99:01.770 --> 00:99:05.350
, to, to my uh site as well.

1274
00:99:05.359 --> 00:99:09.810
So, yeah, if you are interested in anything

1275
00:99:09.819 --> 00:99:12.399
I do, you can always email me or uh

1276
00:99:12.409 --> 00:99:15.418
yeah, I will be very happy to answer to

huge pleasure and a huge honor for me to be

1280
00:99:26.189 --> 00:99:30.489

for my uh language problems. Uh But I hope

1282
00:99:34.930 --> 00:99:39.600
it was a pleasure uh somehow interesting for, for

1283
00:99:39.609 --> 00:99:41.759
you. Thank you for all of those who listened

1284
00:99:41.770 --> 00:99:44.399
to it in the end. No, really?

1285
00:99:44.409 --> 00:99:45.329
