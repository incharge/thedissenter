00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.710
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:09.489
joined by Doctor Zen Pellegrini and J Sat Toulou.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.770
Uh Dr Pellegrini is a professor of performance studies

5
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.350
and Social and cultural analysis at New York University

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.540
and also a psychoanalyst in private practice in New

7
00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:24.149
York City. And Doctor Sato is uh also a

8
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.670
psychoanalyst in New York City and a member of

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.500
the faculty at the NYU postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.180
and Psychoanalysis. And today we're talking about their book

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.659
Gender Without Identity. So, and every welcome to the

12
00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:43.380
show, it's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.080
Thank you. Thank you so much for this invitation.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.599
So uh before we get into the specific content

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.060
of your book, would you like to start by

16
00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.569
telling us? And this is particularly for the audience,

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.659
what motivated you to write this book? And I

18
00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:03.319
mean, because I know that and you describe that

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.199
in the book precisely, uh I know that there's

20
00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.989
a bit of a history behind the book. So

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.260
could you tell us about that?

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.830
Yeah, very storied history. Um I mean, I can

23
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:20.360
say something really quickly about it and maybe Anne

24
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.669
if you wanna like just uh flesh it out

25
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.730
more. Uh THE very short version of it is

26
00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.629
that um uh before we wrote a book, um

27
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.309
we had received a very prestigious award which we

28
00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.379
were very excited about and then faced a lot

29
00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.779
of suppression regarding this work. Uh And I hope

30
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.059
we'll talk a little bit about why today. Um

31
00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.809
And um in facing that suppression, we were left

32
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.709
with having to decide what we were going to

33
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.099
do with that material. And um I will say

34
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.550
more about the details, but we ended up taking

35
00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:56.919
a sharp turn away from publishing in an academic

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.330
journal. Um AND uh deciding that we could approach

37
00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:04.059
a press. We are really enamored by and which

38
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.650
ended up publishing uh this work. So it was

39
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.059
not kind of like how we started out out,

40
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.039
we didn't intend to write this book. This book

41
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.929
is almost, it's, it's strange to say this. Um

42
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.740
And it, it may sound fake but it actually,

43
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.130
it feels very true to us um that the

44
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.460
book was kind of an accident. OK.

45
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.490
Yeah, this, this accidental book is the result of

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.169
um actually a very unhappy experience with the international

47
00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.330
journal of psychoanalysis. Um WHICH is the I JP.

48
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.320
The I GP is the oldest journal in the

49
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.210
field of psychoanalysis. It was founded by Freud himself.

50
00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.520
So it has a very August history. Um We

51
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.050
avi and I wrote a paper together which we

52
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:50.410
submitted for consideration for the first ever Tus paper

53
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.770
award. With this was being given by the Sexual

54
00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.389
and Gender Diversity Studies Committee of the International Psychoanalytical

55
00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:59.949
Association or IP A. The IP A is also,

56
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.899
it's the oldest psychoanalytic organization in the world and

57
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.490
the um Sexual and gender Diversity studies committee. He

58
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.779
started with surprise to actually start to solicit work

59
00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.199
that could sort of push psychoanalysis forward in terms

60
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.630
of thinking about sexual and gender diversities to increase

61
00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.509
um both both psychoanalytic thinking about how to work

62
00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.110
with um LGBT Q people, but also to um

63
00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.240
basically have a more um let's say um affirmative

64
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.229
clinical practices. So we said we wrote a paper

65
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.429
together which was organized around a beautiful case study

66
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.009
of Avi's work with a young gender non conforming

67
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.809
child. We submitted that paper in 2021 and to

68
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.750
our delight, we were awarded the first Tarius Paper

69
00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.800
award and one of the outcomes of this award

70
00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.380
was the possibility of having our um paper published

71
00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.100
in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis. So we submitted

72
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.779
our paper and this, the editors had to read

73
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.699
it and agree that in fact um met their

74
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.360
publication standards and they decided it did. They gave

75
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.279
us some suggestions for revision which we took up.

76
00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.009
We spent a year working on our revisions. During

77
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.770
the course of that, there was a change in

78
00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:11.929
the editorial leadership of the journal. The next um

79
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.250
editor also read the essay also confirmed it was

80
00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.309
going to be published. Also gave us some actually

81
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.970
quite helpful feedback. We made some additional revisions, everything

82
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.299
was on track or so we thought for publication

83
00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.920
we handed in what we thought was our last

84
00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:30.089
version of the article on in June of 2021.

85
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.239
We included in that last version, something that's quite

86
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.489
standard in academic publications. We included the set of

87
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.510
Acknowledgments. That was the first footnote of our essay.

88
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.649
Again, this is completely standard in academic publications that

89
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.880
you would have Acknowledgments. Um You know, thanking people

90
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.420
who had helped you along the way, you know,

91
00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:50.399
sort of and, and um we sent in the

92
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.980
essay, we'd also added a few paragraphs giving more

93
00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:57.179
of the social context for arguments. We didn't hear

94
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.859
back for a week for, for a week. And

95
00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:01.679
then when we heard back everything had changed, we

96
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.709
were kindly, that was the word used, kindly asked

97
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.119
to remove certain sentences from our Acknowledgments. So they

98
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.279
actually highlighted the sentences we wanted removed. We were

99
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.290
told to remove the additional paragraphs we'd added in

100
00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:16.869
the main text giving some of the historical context

101
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.220
for our argument. And we were utterly befuddled. We

102
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.529
were given no reasons for these removals. And when

103
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.760
we asked, um we were actually not told directly,

104
00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.359
um and it became clear quite suddenly that the

105
00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:37.640
publication of our essay which had already been accepted

106
00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:41.420
for publication twice and in writing, but our publication

107
00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.440
was now newly contingent on our willingness to take

108
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.359
out the sentences they demanded we remove. And maybe

109
00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:49.579
a, you can say a little bit about these

110
00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.119
sentences because they actually are connected to the heart

111
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.500
of our books of, of our now books argument.

112
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.000
Yeah. I mean, the, the sentences that we were

113
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.799
asked to remove were doing two things. They were

114
00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.809
welcoming uh trans and queer subjects into psychoanalysis, people

115
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.000
that psychoanalysis is usually treated as problems. Um And

116
00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:14.470
in fact, we were welcoming them. Um Certainly we're

117
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.190
not the first to welcome trans subjects in psychoanalysis.

118
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.429
So it shouldn't become as such a surprise, but

119
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.399
it was very particular to this award which was

120
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.029
put together to actually fight institutional homo transphobia in

121
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.989
psychoanalysis, which is a field with a very bad

122
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.679
history in its treatment of uh of gay and

123
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.109
trans subjects. So we want to make that explicit.

124
00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.140
And we also welcomed uh our trans and queer

125
00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.609
colleagues, not just as patients, but also our colleagues,

126
00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:45.079
our peers, our teachers, our students uh as people

127
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.390
in the field with equitable power rather than as

128
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.250
just subjects of the analytic gaze and of therapeutic

129
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.100
attention. Um And back then, we were at some

130
00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:58.079
point when we really press for what is going

131
00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:00.519
on, we're told this is too political. It's, it's

132
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.600
we, we were told actually that it wasn't good

133
00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.309
for us to include it. And they were trying

134
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.390
to protect us and asking to remove it. And

135
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:11.079
um we, we thought that that was quite absurd.

136
00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.579
Like we, we've both published quite extensively in queer

137
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:18.470
and trans studies. Uh In fact, there's nothing uh

138
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.750
undermining of one's work in acknowledging that um a

139
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.299
field has harmed people. Um I think that the

140
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:30.839
worry probably was more that the field was going

141
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.010
to look bad in some of these things being

142
00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:37.220
named in the journals pages. So we went back

143
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.019
and forth a lot. Um Con fact, there were

144
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.160
um at some point like we, we really protested

145
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.959
the retraction of the publication commitment. Uh We really

146
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.829
um uh expressed our concern about the suppression of

147
00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.709
queerness and that kind of approach to queerness. Um

148
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.670
The journal responded with legal sounding language that generated

149
00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:01.450
a lot of concerns and the people receiving those

150
00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:03.589
emails about whether there was going to be, I

151
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.230
mean, we were told that what we were saying

152
00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:09.299
was a calumny and um slanderous. I think slanderous

153
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:12.880
was a word that was used and correctly. We

154
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.829
came to understand that there were concerns that we

155
00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.519
were going to be sued for libel that he

156
00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:20.130
could be sued for libel just for saying that

157
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.959
suppression was happening, which was quite bizarre because you

158
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.440
know, anybody who has published in a psych Analytic

159
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.070
in a, in a journal, like in the academy

160
00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:32.229
knows that, you know, like Acknowledgments are never kind

161
00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:37.349
of like subjected to this kind of um kind

162
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:41.719
of like constrained. Um THEY are completely separate from

163
00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.969
what one writes in the text itself. It's not

164
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.090
subject to editorial revision. And it's, it's kind of

165
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.530
unheard of for a journal to say we publish

166
00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.700
this and then say, actually we want, unless you

167
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.289
do this or that, um, that we're asking you

168
00:08:57.299 --> 00:08:59.919
to do. Usually that happens during the editorial process

169
00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:03.440
by the time something is accepted, it's accepted. So,

170
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.869
um, you know, there was a lot of back

171
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.119
and forth, eventually became very clear to us that

172
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.020
they were not going to publish it. They told

173
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.380
us we either will publish the previous version or

174
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.119
this one. And we said, no, um they said

175
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.979
you can make your decisions. So with a lot

176
00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:21.750
of anguish because the journal does reach parts of

177
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.780
the world that um are not easily reached, especially

178
00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:26.929
for these kinds of issues. And we didn't want

179
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.330
that kind of reach for the first to prize.

180
00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:33.719
We, we eventually said, ok, we'll, we'll go elsewhere,

181
00:09:33.729 --> 00:09:37.599
we'll take this work elsewhere and then something really

182
00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:41.440
um both um upsetting and also in retrospect, quite

183
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.989
amusing happened. Uh WHICH is that the journal changed

184
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.469
its tune and addressed um the committee to say,

185
00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:50.830
uh some version of like, we don't know these

186
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.580
people, like we don't have an agreement with them.

187
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.429
Our agreement is with you. If your first series

188
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.590
CS prize paper appears elsewhere, you will be in

189
00:09:58.599 --> 00:10:02.099
breach of our agreement, you know, like in breach

190
00:10:02.109 --> 00:10:04.650
of agreement is legal language. So now, of course,

191
00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:07.469
the committee now is also like kind of like

192
00:10:07.479 --> 00:10:10.030
scurrying around trying to figure out is this a

193
00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.260
threat of a lawsuit, like what is going on

194
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.469
here? And if you, you know, in real time,

195
00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:15.869
I have to say I'm laughing now, but in

196
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.489
real time, this was all very upsetting, uh incredibly

197
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.270
stressful. But when you look back on it, it's,

198
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.309
it's kind of like kind of both predictable and

199
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.880
um uh kind of the problem that the committee

200
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.880
was trying to address through the Tus Prize. Um

201
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.289
THAT the first, the first time that the International

202
00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.950
Economic Association is awarding a paper specifically on uh

203
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.599
LGBT Q issues is also met with such resistance

204
00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:50.559
and met with such um like suppression. So kind

205
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.409
of like, so we wanted to, to, to see

206
00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.530
what could happen with this material, we had to

207
00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:58.260
decide what to do with it. And as I

208
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.900
said, at the beginning, we approached a press, we

209
00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:03.719
really love the unconscious in translation. We approached Jonathan

210
00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:08.890
House. Um The press's um editor explained the situation

211
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.909
and asked if he would be willing to publish

212
00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:14.140
it into a kind of like expanded version. And

213
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.880
so we added some material um and a chapter

214
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.520
from a theorist we're working with and the book

215
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.780
came out as gender without identity um in June

216
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:29.549
2023. Um So we're very happy to have a

217
00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:32.799
book now, despite all the back and forth uh

218
00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:36.080
which taught us so much about where psychoanalysis continues

219
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.440
to be.

220
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.000
I mean, we, we wrote, you know, we wrote

221
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.059
the article, uh you know, the paper and then

222
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.340
the article and now the book in part to

223
00:11:43.349 --> 00:11:48.140
flag the, it turns out ongoing difficulties psychoanalysis has

224
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.080
had thinking complexly about diverse genders and sexualities and

225
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.039
not just in thinking but in actually, in its

226
00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:58.690
work with people who present non normative genders or

227
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.630
people who have queer sexualities. So we got an

228
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.929
incredible lesson in real time of precisely those struggles,

229
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.580
those ongoing struggles and psychoanalysis. And they're not just

230
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:13.150
struggles, the actual ways in which psychoanalysis treats queer

231
00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:15.450
and trans people. It has treated and continues to

232
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.169
treat queer and trans people actually despicably, right. Um

233
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.849
There are things changing but um there are, there

234
00:12:23.859 --> 00:12:28.049
are still huge um challenges within psychoanalysis over these

235
00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:28.890
issues.

236
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.010
So let's get into that before we get into

237
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.049
the main argument of your book. Uh IN what

238
00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:42.869
ways uh the psychoanalysis traditionally tend to approach LGBT

239
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.640
Q plus people. I mean, what are some of

240
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.679
the main things they say about uh these people

241
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.049
to put it? That's a great, sorry, go ahead

242
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.780
um to put it a bit in a historical

243
00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:02.380
context. Uh This is no longer the case in

244
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.340
the US, even though it continues to be the

245
00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:06.979
case in other countries in the world. Like if

246
00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:09.200
you're out and gay, it used to be that

247
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.700
you couldn't train, you were explicitly seen as being

248
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.929
pathological and you would be excluded, such as gay

249
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.450
people were advised in the eighties to not disclose

250
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.580
their homosexuality in order to not be disqualified from

251
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.330
being considered to train as psychoanalysts.

252
00:13:28.729 --> 00:13:30.320
But but, but why,

253
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.200
because, because homosexuality was seen as pathology, it was

254
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.919
seen as kind of not having met the developmental

255
00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:44.799
milestones and not having gone through normal development in

256
00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:47.020
the way that a psychoanalyst who should be the

257
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.020
epitome of mental health. Like if you're going to

258
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.750
be treating other people, you should be healthy yourself.

259
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.440
And if you're gay, you're not healthy. And that,

260
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.309
you know, used to be very explicitly the case,

261
00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.179
of course, it would be legal today. But, you

262
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.979
know, it continued to happen um in ways that

263
00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:08.580
are more covert. So nobody would say anymore, like

264
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.340
um that it's because of somebody's homosexuality. But with

265
00:14:13.349 --> 00:14:16.190
time as it became more illegal, people would find

266
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.719
other reasons to reject candidates who were candidates for

267
00:14:19.729 --> 00:14:22.700
training, who were gay. Um AS I said, this

268
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.179
doesn't happen anymore in the United States explicitly. Um

269
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.510
Even though of course, it's always better if you're

270
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.859
gay, if you're also married and perhaps have kids

271
00:14:31.869 --> 00:14:35.020
that really situates you as the safer gay person,

272
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.590
um kind of like common activities alive and well

273
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.979
in, in economic training. But, but in Europe, like,

274
00:14:41.989 --> 00:14:43.659
you know, I was there a few years ago

275
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:46.609
giving a talk actually at that committee's first Study

276
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.979
day, first International Study Day. And a lot of

277
00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:53.409
colleagues from Europe came out as being gay or

278
00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:56.270
queer in that space and expressed their fear of

279
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.989
telling their institutes or express their fears of speaking

280
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.109
up about these kinds of issues for fear of

281
00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:06.080
retribution. Um And this is not to even get

282
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.909
into how psychoanalysis has treated gay patients um or

283
00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:14.059
trans patients. Um I mean, in um in analytic

284
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.960
institutes up until recently, even having uh a training

285
00:15:17.969 --> 00:15:20.179
case when you're trained to be an analyst, you

286
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.000
usually have a case that is very closely supervised

287
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.619
by a colleague. As you're learning how to tran

288
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.200
to transition from doing therapeutic work to analytic work.

289
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.369
And um those cases have to be approved, they

290
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.020
have to meet certain criteria so that they meet

291
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.969
the criteria for your training. They would not approve

292
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:41.549
trans patients as training cases because kind of like

293
00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:44.289
they were too much fringe um kind of like

294
00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:46.239
they were too much out of the norm. So

295
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.159
you see there's like so many levels on which

296
00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:52.400
psychoanalysis has historically failed. Um And as it's been

297
00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:56.070
making changes and trying to make improvements, you see

298
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.739
like the proliferation of these committees. But you also

299
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.659
see kind of like in the experience that we

300
00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:04.520
were describing earlier, how quickly it generates tremendous kind

301
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.510
of resistance.

302
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.580
But let me ask you perhaps a more specific

303
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.299
question also for the audience to have a better

304
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:15.619
understanding of what where those ideas come from. I

305
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.140
mean, perhaps theoretically speaking, why is it that in

306
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:26.989
psychoanalysis, let's say developmentally people would consider a gay

307
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.849
people or trans people to be uh abnormal if

308
00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:33.419
we can use that word here.

309
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.510
I, I think this is a actually a really

310
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.270
important question. And you know, if we go back

311
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.840
to the historical origins of psychoanalysis, which is in

312
00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:46.500
actually Freud's own theory, his body of work, he

313
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.549
was profoundly ambivalent about what we might call today.

314
00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:53.809
Homosexuality. This isn't always the language he used. But

315
00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:55.979
you know, in some of his earliest work and

316
00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:59.580
maybe the famous important text here is his 1905

317
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.119
3 essays and the Theory of sexuality. In the

318
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.050
first edition of that, we see him. Um Actually,

319
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.060
at least in the first two essays is three

320
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.160
essays presenting, you know, saying of sexuality something quite

321
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.089
radical that it could develop in any direction. And

322
00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:17.689
sometimes he's saying there's no such thing as normal

323
00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:21.489
sexuality, right? It it that it could take any

324
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.319
number of forms, any number of object choices, any

325
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:28.150
number of sexual acts can result in pleasure, right?

326
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.109
And so he's really pulled the rug out from

327
00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:34.910
under the normative picture of sexuality as being heterosexuality.

328
00:17:35.719 --> 00:17:37.569
Um That's the first two essays. By the time

329
00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:39.390
you though you get to the third essay of

330
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.479
that text in 1905, he reasserts um the normative

331
00:17:43.489 --> 00:17:46.750
picture of human development. You have to move through

332
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:52.359
these stages towards becoming heterosexual. And that movement towards

333
00:17:52.369 --> 00:17:56.199
becoming heterosexual, a kind of secure heterosexuality includes also

334
00:17:56.209 --> 00:18:01.400
normative gender positions. The boy becomes masculine, the girl

335
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:06.030
becomes feminine. And so this again, this radical that's

336
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.040
there. At the beginning of this text starts to

337
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.900
be gradually pulled back. And you know, this is

338
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.689
this is so even as Freud for example, um

339
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.839
you know said in publicly that um homosexuality should

340
00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:23.050
not be uh illegal, it should, it is not

341
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.910
something that requires institutionalization, which were actually important things

342
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.930
and radical things to say in his day. But

343
00:18:28.939 --> 00:18:31.979
he, he, he really was of two minds um

344
00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:35.560
both in his moment historically and ahead of it

345
00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:38.060
at the same time. It's, you know, um so

346
00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:41.040
there's a conservatism, a kind of tension within psychoanalysis

347
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.280
from the beginning. But the thing, one of the

348
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.780
things that gets picked up from Freud's early thinking

349
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.689
and elaborated by colleagues who are actually perhaps even

350
00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:54.390
more conservative than he ultimately was is that homosexuality

351
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.530
represents a kind of regression. You're supposed to keep

352
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.520
moving forward. There's this picture of a normative development,

353
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.199
you move across time in one direction only. So

354
00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:08.060
if someone gets stuck or fixated on a homosexual

355
00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:11.390
object choice, then this is because you've either again

356
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.209
gotten stuck, you haven't kept progressing in the right

357
00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:17.380
direction or you've fallen backwards, you've had a regression.

358
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.689
It's a kind of, you know, it's like you've

359
00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:22.339
become primitive again in your sexuality. And I use

360
00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:26.030
the term primitive, quite aware of its racial connotations

361
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.770
because that's there too. There's this notion of, you

362
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.829
know, that what does it mean to have a

363
00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:33.910
civilized sexuality which is connected also to projects of

364
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.660
whiteness and colonialism. And that's unfortunately baked into psychoanalysis

365
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.650
because this is also the historical context within which

366
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.329
it emerges.

367
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.530
Uh And, and about that historical context, I mean,

368
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.520
I guess we will come back to that idea

369
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.290
when we talk about in a bit the, the

370
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.000
approach you have to gender identity in the book.

371
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.439
But that's a very important element here, right? In

372
00:19:58.449 --> 00:20:02.469
terms of the development of psychoanalysis as a discipline

373
00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:05.630
and even more more broadly in our society in

374
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.449
general, how we think about gender identity and even

375
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:14.255
how people develop their own gender identities, history and

376
00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:17.625
social context is very important here.

377
00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:20.584
Absolutely. And you know, again, I, I think there's

378
00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:24.175
so many radical openings in Freud and in other

379
00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:29.015
psychoanalytic thinkers, but there's a whole conservative plot around

380
00:20:29.025 --> 00:20:30.354
them, so to speak, it's sort of like it

381
00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:33.844
gets slowed down. And certainly, you know, A and

382
00:20:33.854 --> 00:20:36.285
II, I um it is fair to say this

383
00:20:36.295 --> 00:20:38.839
and both of us, we love psychoanalysis and we

384
00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:41.660
love its possibilities, what it can actually offer for

385
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.920
queer and trans life. We actually think it can

386
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.000
offer us different ways to think about our, about

387
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.219
ourselves, our interactions with others and to promote flourishing

388
00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:54.349
for all sorts of diversities. But we're also aware

389
00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:56.160
that some of the ways in which it got

390
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.030
again, ST psychoanalysis has gotten stuck in certain ways,

391
00:21:00.069 --> 00:21:03.010
these are ongoing problems. And we really would like

392
00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.199
to, you know, we, we offer this book and

393
00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:07.020
arguments as a way to sort of try to

394
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.119
loosen up some of these impasses within psychoanalysis because

395
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.770
we think it is actually can offer very supple

396
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.369
ways to think about how anyone becomes and changes

397
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.339
over time because we are actually interested in our

398
00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:23.920
book in the question of development. But what's very

399
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.760
distinctive about the argument we're offering is we would

400
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.219
distinguish development actually charting how things change over time

401
00:21:31.229 --> 00:21:35.739
from the developmental is which actually states you can

402
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.339
only develop in one direction only. And any departure

403
00:21:39.349 --> 00:21:42.579
from this linear chronology of A to B this

404
00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:46.439
again, teleological linear chronology, any departure from that means

405
00:21:46.449 --> 00:21:49.390
that you've been warped, means that you're pathological means

406
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.180
that something in you has gone wrong.

407
00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:55.900
So tell us then about the sort of uh

408
00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.959
argument regarding gender identity that you present in the

409
00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:03.420
book. I mean, tell us about the main argument

410
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.869
and then we can break it down and go

411
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.819
through some of its details.

412
00:22:08.199 --> 00:22:12.160
Yeah, I mean, there's two main threads to the

413
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.239
argument in the book and both of them have

414
00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.689
to do with what Anne was saying earlier. Uh

415
00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:20.089
ABOUT how much we love psychoanalysis. Like, you know,

416
00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:21.819
with everything that we've said so far, it would

417
00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:23.859
be easy to say. So why bother? And many

418
00:22:23.869 --> 00:22:25.979
people have said like in the academy and in

419
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:28.739
the clinic in clinical settings have said, why bother

420
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.069
with psychoanalysis? It's outdated, it's homophobic, it's transphobic, let's

421
00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:34.790
just throw it out. But the reason why we

422
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.949
persist is because we think that there are so

423
00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:42.780
many um so many concepts in psychoanalysis about which

424
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.890
I'll speak in a moment that offer us ways

425
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.729
of thinking and understanding human experience and psychic life

426
00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:52.699
that are not available in any other therapeutic or

427
00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:58.699
psychological theory. So, psychoanalysis has a deep appreciation for

428
00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:02.449
the strangeness of the unconscious and for things that

429
00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.319
are outside our awareness and nevertheless exert an influence

430
00:23:06.329 --> 00:23:10.530
on us and our every day uh producing like

431
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.650
say symptoms or errors that we think are dismissible,

432
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.609
but nevertheless, an important turn out to be important

433
00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:23.829
dreams. Um But also for thinking about the other

434
00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:25.790
way of thinking about the unconscious, which is also

435
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.670
very important is as something that is always that

436
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.079
has to do with something that we will never

437
00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:33.280
fully be able to know about ourselves, that we're

438
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.530
always foreign to ourselves, to some degree and that

439
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.609
we stand to be surprised by ourselves. However well,

440
00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:42.199
we may think we know ourselves. Psych analysis is

441
00:23:42.209 --> 00:23:46.739
like really remarkable in that respect. So it is

442
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.119
based on some of these ideas that we make

443
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.849
two main arguments in the book. The one is

444
00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:56.020
that this notion of gender identity, which in fact

445
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.140
started from psychoanalysis and has spread in many other

446
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.199
types of discourses and conversations. It was proposed by

447
00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:07.609
Robert Soler in 1964. This notion of gender identity

448
00:24:07.949 --> 00:24:10.619
that presumes that there is something true about one's

449
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.089
own experience of one's gender at the core of

450
00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:17.209
the self. Um The first argument in the book

451
00:24:17.219 --> 00:24:19.180
is to say that this is fictional, it's made

452
00:24:19.189 --> 00:24:22.689
up uh which may sound very surprising to some

453
00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:26.280
people because that, that language has really taken and

454
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.140
not only is it um a fictionalized concept, it's

455
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.160
also not a concept that serves as well. Um

456
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.329
It's a concept that does a lot of damage

457
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:39.520
and we can talk about this more uh through

458
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.400
our conversation. The second argument is to say that

459
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.469
nobody kind of like is it follows from this

460
00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:48.650
notion that gender identity is a fiction but nobody

461
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.650
is born into their gender. Nobody has a gender

462
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.599
that is correct or incorrect about them. Like we

463
00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:57.239
may feel that our gender is right or not,

464
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.650
but there's no gender in the core of the

465
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.150
self that can be confirmed or discon confirmed our

466
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.589
genders come again. This is true for cis people,

467
00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:08.839
for trans people, for gender queer people. It's true

468
00:25:08.849 --> 00:25:10.979
for everyone. It's not just an argument for trans

469
00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:16.209
nest. Um And that psychic processes including trauma may

470
00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:18.619
have something to do with how somebody comes into

471
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.680
their gender, how somebody acquires a gender so that

472
00:25:22.689 --> 00:25:25.750
we want to be able to start conversations about

473
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.469
what it means to not have been feeling like

474
00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:33.020
you're trans from however young, like, you know, people

475
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.920
say, like ever since I was two years old,

476
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.650
I was dressing and kind of like, I always

477
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.420
wanted to wearing dresses. Like, certainly some people have

478
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.920
that experience. But we believe that it is also

479
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.020
important to have ways of thinking about how people

480
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:49.250
become trans or become queer or become sis, which

481
00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.500
is language that we have generally associated with conversion

482
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.030
practices. Um And perhaps I will say a little

483
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.469
bit more about that. Um But we need to

484
00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:06.609
bring that language into our, into affirming thinking for

485
00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:08.979
queer and trans life. And psychoanalysis gives us a

486
00:26:08.989 --> 00:26:09.890
way to do that.

487
00:26:10.739 --> 00:26:14.739
Uh So you're certainly making here an argument against

488
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.420
the idea of gender identity being in some way

489
00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:23.010
innate, right? And being the result of certain, for

490
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:28.829
example, biological predispositions, like for example, uh brain wiring

491
00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:31.920
or a set of hormones that you have in

492
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.280
your body or a certain set of genes or

493
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.439
something like that.

494
00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:40.479
Right. Absolutely. Um And, and, and I know that

495
00:26:40.489 --> 00:26:42.630
kind of like you have some things that you

496
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.099
might want to say about how we came to

497
00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:47.959
put so much weight on those ideas.

498
00:26:48.869 --> 00:26:51.670
Yes. Yeah, we're definitely arguing against the idea that

499
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.319
either gender or sexuality is inborn. Um And to

500
00:26:56.329 --> 00:26:59.489
that degree immutable because of some sort of biological

501
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.729
basis, whether that biological basis be located in hormones

502
00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:05.680
and DNA um in some, in some region of

503
00:27:05.689 --> 00:27:08.869
the hypothalamus. This was one speculated in respect to

504
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.770
the homosexuality. Um And one of our, we, we

505
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.989
make this observation right, that we, that we do

506
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.819
not think that gender or sexuality is inborn. We

507
00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:23.439
make this observation as clinicians. We also make this

508
00:27:23.449 --> 00:27:26.020
observation on the basis of, you know, I think

509
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.839
we're both persuaded by um years now of work

510
00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:34.349
by historians of gender and sexuality who are pointing

511
00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:37.800
to its social construction, its variability uh and how

512
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.800
in systems that try to organize gender and sexuality,

513
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:44.910
its variability across cultures. Um But we're also, we're

514
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.300
also aware and this, we, we see that part

515
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.439
of our argument is actually quite um I, I

516
00:27:50.449 --> 00:27:54.229
suppose it could be controversial that we are in

517
00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:57.630
a moment when L GB Q, LGBT Q people

518
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.329
are under attack in numerous national contacts. I'll just

519
00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:04.089
speak about the United States right now. Um As

520
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:06.920
of early April, I haven't checked since April 2nd,

521
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.290
but as of April 2nd, 484 bills have been

522
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.979
introduced into state legislatures across the United States to

523
00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:18.750
restrict in some way LGBT Q rights and access

524
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.910
to health care. A lot of these bills have

525
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.170
focused on blocking access to gender affirmative care for

526
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.900
trans youth and also for trans adults. So there

527
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.459
is kind of there's a huge not just public

528
00:28:29.469 --> 00:28:31.260
debate, but we could even say a kind of

529
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.050
war on trans people in particular. And it's not

530
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.540
just happening in the United States. I just know

531
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.150
the the statistics about films in the United States,

532
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.689
right? And in the face of such open opposition

533
00:28:42.699 --> 00:28:46.489
to the very possibility of there being trans people.

534
00:28:47.219 --> 00:28:49.949
It just seemed as if the only argument we

535
00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:52.619
who would advocate for trans and queer life would

536
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.510
make. It seemed as if the only argument we

537
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.430
can make is to say that we were born

538
00:28:56.439 --> 00:29:00.790
that way we can't change. Therefore, we deserve equal

539
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.359
rights on the basis of who we are immutably.

540
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.800
Right? So one of the reasons I think born

541
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.140
that way and arguments for mutability have gained traction

542
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.459
is it seemed like that's the only thing we

543
00:29:11.469 --> 00:29:14.449
can say to protect us from discrimination. But it

544
00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:16.780
actually hasn't worked. I mean, it actually hasn't worked

545
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.170
legally, it hasn't worked politically to secure these rights.

546
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.939
It hasn't defeated attempts to roll back rights that

547
00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:25.859
have already been extended. We also think it's ethically

548
00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:29.089
short sighted because the reason not to discriminate against

549
00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:31.959
queer and trans and gender queer people is not

550
00:29:31.969 --> 00:29:33.800
because we were born that way. It's because it's

551
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.430
wrong to discriminate against queer and trans people. It's

552
00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:40.599
just wrong, right. That's so we don't, to me,

553
00:29:40.609 --> 00:29:42.859
you don't need to like an argument from immutability

554
00:29:42.869 --> 00:29:46.319
to make that case. And then as clinicians, it

555
00:29:46.329 --> 00:29:49.319
doesn't square with what we're hearing from the people

556
00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:52.369
we sit with once a week, twice a week,

557
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.579
three times a week, four times a week, we

558
00:29:54.589 --> 00:29:58.079
are hearing much more complex stories about people's genders

559
00:29:58.089 --> 00:30:00.449
and people's sexualities when we sit with them and

560
00:30:00.459 --> 00:30:02.329
when they have the freedom and under and believe

561
00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:04.770
themselves to be in a space that they can

562
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.469
trust when people have the freedom to start talking

563
00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:10.270
about how their own gender, for example, has changed

564
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.780
across their lifetime or how indeed that gender may

565
00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.430
have shifted. They've experienced a shift in the wake

566
00:30:16.439 --> 00:30:19.439
of some traumatic event or maybe their sexuality has

567
00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:21.760
shifted in the wake of some traumatic event when

568
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.410
there's the freedom for people to talk about it.

569
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.689
You start hearing how gender and sexuality are not

570
00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:30.079
so immutable are not. So, you know, as it

571
00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:33.380
were stuck for any of us, that their change

572
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.770
does indeed happen. That doesn't this is not a

573
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.500
romance for change because change can also feel scary,

574
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.739
it can feel disorienting. But we, you know, we

575
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.050
think that for all sorts of reasons, again, clinical,

576
00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:51.619
ethical, political legal, the born that way argument just

577
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.010
we actually think it's wrong, it's incorrect, it's not

578
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.810
accurate to the complexity of people's lives.

579
00:31:01.369 --> 00:31:04.270
Uh So before we break down a little bit,

580
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.349
what you just mentioned there, and uh let me

581
00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:11.140
just ask you this. So within your argument uh

582
00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:17.089
about gender identity, would there still be space for

583
00:31:17.099 --> 00:31:21.425
uh certain people who say that they feel that

584
00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:25.724
in their own experience, they were born this or

585
00:31:25.734 --> 00:31:28.584
that way? I mean, is there still space for

586
00:31:28.635 --> 00:31:34.515
accommodating uh those kinds of experiences that people report

587
00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:35.234
or not?

588
00:31:35.244 --> 00:31:38.594
Absolutely. And I really appreciate you saying that we

589
00:31:38.604 --> 00:31:42.505
are in no way legislating how any queer, trans

590
00:31:42.515 --> 00:31:47.415
bisexual gender, non conforming person would describe their relationship

591
00:31:47.425 --> 00:31:51.280
to their gender or their sexuality and especially in

592
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.239
a world where unfortunately, in so many national contexts,

593
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.089
there are laws that would restrict LGBT Q life.

594
00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:02.619
So for someone who is minoritized, marginalized, even oppressed

595
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.500
because of their gender and sexuality, for such a

596
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.300
person to give any account of themselves is an

597
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.459
act actually of, of I think of courage and

598
00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:11.770
is to be commended and affirmed. So we're not

599
00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.310
telling those queer and trans people who would save

600
00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.219
themselves, they're born that way. Oh, you're so foolish.

601
00:32:16.229 --> 00:32:18.239
We're not saying that at all with this. We're,

602
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.849
we're not in that respect. We would not be

603
00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:23.359
so condescending and arrogant as to presume to tell,

604
00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:25.819
to tell anyone how they're supposed to tell the

605
00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:30.060
story themselves. But because so many queer and trans

606
00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:34.540
people would not describe their genders or their sexuality

607
00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.589
in the language of born. That way, we need

608
00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:39.349
to provide more space for the much more complex

609
00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:42.630
stories. People in fact do tell about themselves, but

610
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.099
which, but which some people are being told. Don't

611
00:32:45.109 --> 00:32:46.790
say that in public, it's gonna hurt the movement.

612
00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.500
Don't say that in public is going to make

613
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.339
it harder to pass um anti discs laws because

614
00:32:52.349 --> 00:32:56.170
you're, you're basically giving, you're, you're basically in giving

615
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.359
comfort to those who say that trans and queerness

616
00:32:58.369 --> 00:32:59.890
are a matter of being warped. And, you know,

617
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.780
obviously you can say something about the warped that

618
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.599
way, argument. Uh We, we want to create more

619
00:33:04.609 --> 00:33:11.329
expansive um conversation that really holds open the complexities

620
00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:14.339
of how anyone becomes who and how they are.

621
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.069
You know, this is very interesting to me because

622
00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:22.030
uh and this is probably the main reason why

623
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.329
I really loved your book is because even before

624
00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:28.729
I read it, uh for a few years, I've

625
00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:32.060
been having this fought and I, I mean, I'm

626
00:33:32.069 --> 00:33:36.310
not gay, I'm not a ransom or anything like

627
00:33:36.319 --> 00:33:39.589
that. I, I mean, I'm a see straight man.

628
00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:43.170
So people might say, oh, you have no saying

629
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.280
on this matter and that's fair enough. But still

630
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:50.449
when it comes to protecting LGBT Q plus rights,

631
00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.209
yes, that it's still fair to have this sort

632
00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:57.729
of discussion where whatever kind of gender identity or

633
00:33:57.739 --> 00:34:01.089
sexual orientation you might have because I think that

634
00:34:01.099 --> 00:34:04.829
when it comes to relying too much on this

635
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:08.010
kind of born this way type of argument, uh

636
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.168
I agree with you when you say that it

637
00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:14.168
might be harmful even for advancing LGBT Q plus

638
00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:18.110
rights. Because first of all, the argument, as you

639
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.860
said should be, uh it's, there's nothing wrong with

640
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:29.969
being gay, lesbian, trans person because that's not wrong.

641
00:34:29.978 --> 00:34:32.938
There's nothing wrong with that. And that should be

642
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:36.513
the argument and not, oh, it's not wrong because

643
00:34:36.523 --> 00:34:39.634
people can't change it. It's not wrong because they

644
00:34:39.643 --> 00:34:42.224
were born that way. So there's nothing we can

645
00:34:42.233 --> 00:34:45.634
do about it. It's just their nature or something

646
00:34:45.643 --> 00:34:49.143
along those lines. But then the second way by

647
00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:52.360
which it can be harmful is that what if

648
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.458
people find out that that's not true and that

649
00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:01.699
people can actually change their gender identity or even

650
00:35:01.709 --> 00:35:05.479
through unconscious processes or something like that through their

651
00:35:05.489 --> 00:35:09.850
own history experience. And even I, I mean, I'm

652
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.050
not sure if that would be true in any

653
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.229
way or not, but, but even through their own

654
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:18.530
choice because even if this was a choice, I

655
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.550
don't think there would be anything wrong with that

656
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.310
again. So I, I mean, what are your thoughts

657
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.810
on all of what I just said here?

658
00:35:27.989 --> 00:35:30.290
I mean, it's so interesting to hear you say,

659
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.929
look, I'm not gay or trans myself, but this

660
00:35:32.939 --> 00:35:36.169
idea of like gender is immutable and it's in

661
00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:37.929
you and you have it from the beginning doesn't

662
00:35:37.939 --> 00:35:41.090
make sense. Um Kind of like you don't have

663
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.850
to be gay or trans to see that there's

664
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.770
nothing that adds up about that kind of narrative.

665
00:35:46.939 --> 00:35:49.010
Now, as Anne was saying, kind of like our

666
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.689
argument is pitched to clinicians and it's pitched to

667
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:56.239
people who think about gender and to politicians who

668
00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.689
kind of like want to see some notion and

669
00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.699
you know, when we say that like, gender is

670
00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:04.699
not immutable, we don't just mean biologically that, you

671
00:36:04.709 --> 00:36:07.679
know, there's no chromosome or hormone or whatever. We

672
00:36:07.689 --> 00:36:10.290
also mean that this notion, this psychologize notion of

673
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.620
like your internal sense of who you are is

674
00:36:13.629 --> 00:36:16.919
something true that that too is an argument of

675
00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:20.459
immutability and an argument of innateness, even as that

676
00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:24.159
is not hinged on biology, but hinged on psychological

677
00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:28.370
truth. Right. So, um, you know, like when you

678
00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:30.620
say, and I really, like when you said, like,

679
00:36:30.629 --> 00:36:32.639
you know, what if it were a choice, um

680
00:36:32.649 --> 00:36:34.679
you know, like what would be wrong with that?

681
00:36:34.689 --> 00:36:36.929
It's only if you start with the premise that

682
00:36:36.939 --> 00:36:40.189
being trans or queer is a bad outcome that

683
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:42.550
having it be a choice becomes a problem. And

684
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.939
I think kind of like you don't have to

685
00:36:43.949 --> 00:36:46.020
be queer or trans to see that uh you

686
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.629
just have to be a thinking person. Um But

687
00:36:49.639 --> 00:36:52.949
you know, but, but here's where psychoanalysis offers us

688
00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:56.610
a different kind of resource, um which is kind

689
00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.560
of both paradoxical and we think very expensive and

690
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.879
hopeful, which is to say that kind of like,

691
00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:05.379
even as there's nothing wrong with people making a

692
00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:08.760
choice, there's also ways in which kind of like

693
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:14.120
we, things appeal to us, our bodies are experienced

694
00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:17.969
by us in certain ways, our attractions, our relations,

695
00:37:17.979 --> 00:37:22.649
our understandings of ourselves come to us, not always

696
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:26.629
as a result of a choice. Um But not

697
00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:32.540
neither as imposed necessarily that sometimes of like very

698
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.270
complex psychic processes, some of which have to do

699
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.679
with unconscious life and like synergize, kind of like

700
00:37:40.689 --> 00:37:44.120
come together to make us who we are. So

701
00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:49.479
one of the most forceful and formidable, I think

702
00:37:49.719 --> 00:37:51.949
uh formidable in the sense of pushing back against

703
00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:54.800
received wisdom, arguments that we make in the book

704
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.560
is this idea that even trauma may have something

705
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.399
to do with how somebody becomes the gender that

706
00:38:01.409 --> 00:38:05.040
they understand themselves to be. And this takes us

707
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.629
back to what Anne referenced as a war this

708
00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:09.909
way. So on the one hand, we have born

709
00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:12.040
this way as like that's how you were born

710
00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:14.600
with this kind of gender identity or these genes.

711
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.199
On the other hand, you have this idea that

712
00:38:16.209 --> 00:38:19.689
everybody should be cis or trans cis or binary

713
00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:23.679
gendered from the beginning. And if you mistakenly think

714
00:38:23.689 --> 00:38:27.310
mistakenly in quotes that you're uh trans or non

715
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.270
binary or gender queer, that's because something bad must

716
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.070
have happened to you that kind of derailed you

717
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.709
from your normal and healthy course. And I put

718
00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:39.110
normal and healthy in quotes, um normal and healthy

719
00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.820
course that would have made you kind of like

720
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:46.530
normative gendered. That argument has been very much weaponized

721
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.600
and used against queer and trans people um in

722
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:54.360
including by queer and trans people themselves who find

723
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.330
who, who we see the clinic being very worried

724
00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:01.350
that if something about their sexuality may have a

725
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.760
little bit to do with, or a lot to

726
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.659
do with trauma or if something about their gender

727
00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:12.770
shifts after a traumatic experience, then maybe they're not

728
00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.729
truly trans or truly queer, maybe they're just bent

729
00:39:16.739 --> 00:39:19.199
out of shape or derailed. And I, I was

730
00:39:19.209 --> 00:39:21.469
thinking, I don't know if, uh, if you or

731
00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:23.810
any of our listeners have had a chance to

732
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:28.169
see Baby Reindeer the, the Netflix series, um, that

733
00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:31.639
is now kind of like, actually quite everybody's talking

734
00:39:31.649 --> 00:39:35.479
about. It's a really interesting Netflix series because it

735
00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:39.570
is, it portrays the true story of a man

736
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.750
who begins to who has kind of like an

737
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.120
experience of sexual assault, which it takes him some

738
00:39:47.129 --> 00:39:49.810
time to understand it as a sexual assault. And

739
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.790
it raises questions about whether it inflects sexual orientation,

740
00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.689
whether his desires uh that begin to deviate from

741
00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:06.070
being just straight desires are somehow impacted by this

742
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.540
trauma. Now, the usual response to that the affirmative

743
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.949
response, the non homophobic response is absolutely not. Maybe

744
00:40:13.959 --> 00:40:16.899
this just helped him understand that he was gay

745
00:40:16.969 --> 00:40:19.770
or this is a homophobic argument to make. But

746
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.274
part of what we want to do and what

747
00:40:21.284 --> 00:40:24.695
we do through psychoanalysis and gender without identity is

748
00:40:24.705 --> 00:40:28.485
to say that of course, trauma can have a

749
00:40:28.495 --> 00:40:32.745
share in. So how somebody acquires their gender, how

750
00:40:32.754 --> 00:40:36.415
somebody acquires their sexuality without that having to mean

751
00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:42.169
that it's delegitimizing of somebody's trans. If, if trauma

752
00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:44.459
has something to do with your queerness that does

753
00:40:44.469 --> 00:40:47.449
not make you less queer or not truly queer

754
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.639
because that's also how heterosexuality and and normative gender

755
00:40:52.649 --> 00:40:55.469
are also constituted. They're also constituted through trauma. We're

756
00:40:55.479 --> 00:40:57.770
just not used to seeing them as constituted. We

757
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.229
see them as just having been there always. Um

758
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.570
And we can say more about how that happens

759
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.090
for heterosexuality and cis gender too. But like what

760
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.050
we want to do is help both our colleagues

761
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.580
in our field. But also uh larger conversations that

762
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.030
are happening around g we want to help people

763
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.760
build a tolerance for thinking about how trauma does

764
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.649
not just break you or warp you or uh

765
00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:27.169
disfigure your psychic life. But it can also put

766
00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:30.530
emotional processes that take you in different directions that

767
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.409
people do not just do things about their trauma,

768
00:41:34.419 --> 00:41:37.290
they also do things with their trauma. And those

769
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.330
things that we do with trauma are as much

770
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.340
part of psychic autonomy, as conscious choices that we

771
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.409
make even as they may not be as conscious

772
00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.050
um as the decision to do this or that.

773
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.409
Um

774
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.959
mhm uh So, but just for this point to

775
00:41:54.969 --> 00:41:58.139
be clear because um I, I mean, o of

776
00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:02.699
course, I'm not very much into psychoanalytic theory. So

777
00:42:02.709 --> 00:42:06.419
you will have to explain, explain this bit here.

778
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.969
So when it comes to trauma, because of course,

779
00:42:09.979 --> 00:42:12.620
I would imagine that the sort of ways people

780
00:42:12.629 --> 00:42:16.520
approach trauma, for example, in social psychology or in

781
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.780
sociology would differ from the ways U psycho analysts

782
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:26.600
approach trauma. So for the audience, how do psychoanalysts

783
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:32.209
usually approach trauma? What the stra mean for psycho

784
00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:34.060
for psychoanalysis?

785
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.209
I I'll begin and then I want, I'll hand

786
00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:38.209
the VP as well. I mean, I guess one

787
00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:39.709
thing to say is that there is no one

788
00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:42.919
way in which trauma is theorized and thought about

789
00:42:42.929 --> 00:42:48.070
within even psychoanalysis. Um SO, and, and one, um

790
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.139
let's say particular way in which even psychoanalysis has

791
00:42:51.149 --> 00:42:52.760
struggled over the question of trauma. And this is

792
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.350
something ay has talked about at length in her

793
00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.719
solo book, Sexuality Beyond Consent is that psychoanalysis, numerous

794
00:43:00.729 --> 00:43:05.879
psychological practices, psychotherapies often speak of trauma as something

795
00:43:05.889 --> 00:43:10.489
that is can be cured or healed, that it's

796
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.120
something that broke into and broke apart and otherwise

797
00:43:15.129 --> 00:43:18.370
intact subject, right? And so then the, so the

798
00:43:18.379 --> 00:43:21.770
task of a therapeutic treatment, the task of clinical

799
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.120
work would be to help put the pieces back

800
00:43:24.129 --> 00:43:26.199
together to, we can use the language of heal

801
00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:30.129
or cure this despite the fact that when pushed

802
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:34.489
pretty much every psychoanalyst would say you can't actually

803
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.320
heal or cure trauma. So then what is it,

804
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:41.719
is trauma, something that is a matter of breaking

805
00:43:41.729 --> 00:43:43.500
us apart and that we're trying to put back

806
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.580
together or is it, does it do a different

807
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.189
kind of work? So we are in our book

808
00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:53.129
and our thinking, drawing on a particular psychoanalytic way

809
00:43:53.139 --> 00:43:54.800
of thinking about trauma. We're drawing on the work

810
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:58.060
of Jean Laplanche, she was a deep um reader

811
00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.159
of Freud. Um BUT he um makes some really

812
00:44:02.169 --> 00:44:05.560
interesting points about trauma as being normative to the

813
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.929
generation, the production of any self that there's something

814
00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:12.330
about the way in which we're all set into

815
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.620
motion. And La Planche even thinks about the constitution

816
00:44:15.629 --> 00:44:17.129
of what we could call the ego and the

817
00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:21.659
constitution of what psychoanalysis calls the unconscious. Out of

818
00:44:21.899 --> 00:44:25.500
the the ne the infants struggle to make sense

819
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.370
of materials that have come into the infant body

820
00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:32.409
from the other, from the parental other quite often

821
00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:35.949
from caretakers material that the infant has to make

822
00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:39.939
sense of. Um AND has to make sense of

823
00:44:39.949 --> 00:44:42.780
in part because even the adult doesn't even know

824
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.669
the particular kinds of messages or communications they're making

825
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.159
and just these ordinary acts of care of holding

826
00:44:50.169 --> 00:44:51.780
the infant, of cleaning the infant of feeding the

827
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:55.020
infant. We're not talking about an adult who's making

828
00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:57.709
as it were traumatic incursions into the infant through

829
00:44:57.719 --> 00:45:01.939
sexual abuse. We're talking about everyday interactions between the

830
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:06.090
adult and the infant. Laplanche says become the occasions

831
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:11.000
for a certain kind of implantation of of adult

832
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.860
material which is unconscious to the adult into the

833
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:17.360
infant. This is what La Planche thinks of as

834
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.149
a kind of normative trauma that set something in

835
00:45:20.159 --> 00:45:23.120
motion. And this is and what is set into

836
00:45:23.129 --> 00:45:25.919
motion is the effort the infant then must make

837
00:45:25.929 --> 00:45:29.429
the the infant becoming human, right? Um The effort

838
00:45:29.439 --> 00:45:32.520
the infant must make to as it were translate

839
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:38.449
those strange intrusions from the the adult unconscious to

840
00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:41.899
translate a content that actually has no content. And

841
00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:44.949
here's some, here's a space for psychic freedom. That

842
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:48.560
translation has is a space of psychic freedom. Why?

843
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.330
Because there's no actual content that even the adult

844
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.169
doesn't know the content of those communications and the

845
00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:59.469
infant translates will come to language as it were

846
00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:03.129
or represent things that have happened by drawing on

847
00:46:03.139 --> 00:46:05.909
material from the Laplanche uses the language of the

848
00:46:05.919 --> 00:46:09.360
myth of symbolic. Basically drawing on the vernaculars, the

849
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.389
categories made available in the culture of the family

850
00:46:12.399 --> 00:46:15.989
and in the wider culture and these categories, these

851
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.760
concepts, these vernaculars include the vernaculars of gender, include

852
00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.840
the vernaculars of sexuality. So we draw on these

853
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.300
categories outside ourselves to make sense of something that's

854
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.000
come into ourselves. Laplanche would say, and again, that's

855
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.350
normative trauma. It happens to all of us. He

856
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.850
even argues it's necessary that it happens to all

857
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.649
of us to set us in motion to become

858
00:46:37.659 --> 00:46:40.879
a particular kind of human. This we could distinguish

859
00:46:40.889 --> 00:46:44.729
this normative trauma from, we could say uppercase t

860
00:46:44.739 --> 00:46:48.510
trauma which are events that not everyone experiences. It

861
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.810
could be the, the the trauma of um a

862
00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.850
sexual assault, the trauma of um the experience of

863
00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.280
genocide, the trauma of even everyday racism we could

864
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.040
think of as a kind of trauma that accumulates

865
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.909
on top of the normative trauma of being, you

866
00:47:06.919 --> 00:47:11.929
know, called into subjectivity. But this is we're drawing

867
00:47:11.939 --> 00:47:13.649
in the plan and we're also drawing on it

868
00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:16.189
through work has done uh on her own as

869
00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:16.520
well.

870
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:19.649
So let me ask you about this since we're

871
00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:24.429
talking here about gender identity and also more specifically

872
00:47:24.439 --> 00:47:28.620
about trends, people. What do you think about the

873
00:47:28.629 --> 00:47:32.959
diagnosis of gender dysphoria? I mean, how would you

874
00:47:32.969 --> 00:47:36.139
approach that through this perspective?

875
00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:39.830
Yeah, this is a really important question because gender

876
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.989
dysphoria is the catchphrase right now on how uh

877
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.629
trans people are being seen as kind of like

878
00:47:48.639 --> 00:47:53.379
abnormalize and pathological. Um Let me actually loop to

879
00:47:53.389 --> 00:47:55.679
your question through something that Ann said, you know,

880
00:47:55.689 --> 00:47:58.959
when you were asking about trauma. Um YOU know,

881
00:47:58.969 --> 00:48:00.649
another way to say some of the things that

882
00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:04.919
Ann was describing is that no, usually in popular

883
00:48:04.929 --> 00:48:07.610
culture and in some therapeutic models, we think of

884
00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.840
trauma as you have an organized self, you have,

885
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.540
you are who you are and then you have

886
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:15.070
something from the outside, either overwhelming you or trying

887
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.050
to damage you and then you have to protect

888
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.770
against it. And if you can protect against its

889
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.760
success and if you can't, you can get traumatized.

890
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.199
So trauma is usually seen as kind of like

891
00:48:25.209 --> 00:48:28.739
a trespass from the outside, right? And it is

892
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.340
in that model that the idea is that if

893
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:33.550
you have been broken by trauma, then the point

894
00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.459
is to be repaired to return to some intact.

895
00:48:37.149 --> 00:48:41.270
But the, the particular offering of psychoanalysis that we're

896
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.280
working with here is this idea that of like

897
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.969
that we are broken through by things all the

898
00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:49.669
time, from the beginning of our lives, through the

899
00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:52.840
through our experiences. In fact, people who imagine that

900
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:57.439
they are unbreakable or deserve to be unbroken are

901
00:48:57.449 --> 00:49:00.270
people with kind of like social privilege with certain

902
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.709
kinds of entitlements. Uh Whiteness works very much like

903
00:49:03.719 --> 00:49:05.629
that. It's entitled to be unbroken. And if it's

904
00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:07.790
broken, then kind of like somebody has to be

905
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.250
harmed uh over it. Um So kind of like

906
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.149
the model that we're working with is the idea

907
00:49:14.159 --> 00:49:18.219
that trauma is actually everywhere in psychic life and

908
00:49:18.229 --> 00:49:20.000
that it is in response to trauma that the

909
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.590
psyche is forced to, to invent to do something

910
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.909
with what you do with that breach from what

911
00:49:26.919 --> 00:49:29.860
can be experienced from the outside. Once it's inside

912
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.629
you, it's too late like it's already inside you.

913
00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:33.189
Another question is what do you do with it?

914
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.899
You can try to evict it. But sometimes, I

915
00:49:36.909 --> 00:49:40.040
mean, like there's certainly many models through for thinking

916
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.560
about how some organisms take that thing from the

917
00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.830
uh from what feels like the outside and do

918
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.639
something with it and make it part of the

919
00:49:47.649 --> 00:49:52.139
self and may make something, sometimes that thing become

920
00:49:52.149 --> 00:49:57.239
works and sometimes it doesn't. Um So when, when

921
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.560
you're talking about gender dysphoria to come back to,

922
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:03.800
to your specific question, the term gender dysphoria presumes

923
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:07.719
that this psychic, this, this person should have stayed

924
00:50:07.729 --> 00:50:12.750
intact in there, presumably original. And I'll put this

925
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.800
in air, quote, healthy gender of being and binary,

926
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.239
but something has invaded them and it causes them

927
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.010
like in the world this way, uh reference that

928
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.090
we're making earlier and it has caused them to

929
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.070
be dysphoric. When in fact, if it had not

930
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.629
invaded them, they would have been at peace with

931
00:50:32.639 --> 00:50:40.209
their normative cisgender. Um This of course, doesn't permit

932
00:50:40.219 --> 00:50:43.709
for the possibility that kind of like, first of

933
00:50:43.719 --> 00:50:45.929
all, you kind of like not, we don't start

934
00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:49.419
out sis or binary and it does permit for

935
00:50:49.429 --> 00:50:53.080
the fact that people do with trauma, all kinds

936
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:57.199
of things including kind of like pro uh coming,

937
00:50:57.209 --> 00:51:00.929
coming to different kinds of genders. Um So gender

938
00:51:00.939 --> 00:51:07.479
dysphoria is a very anthologizing way of talking about

939
00:51:07.489 --> 00:51:11.500
trans because it presumes that you are, I was

940
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.810
like it, it used to be, I mean, I

941
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.850
should, I should finish this thought first because it

942
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.709
presumes that there's something pathological about being trans. Now,

943
00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:22.090
historically, it used to be a way that people

944
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.350
were talking, trying to describe their relationship with their

945
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.969
body that they were feeling dysphoria between how they

946
00:51:27.979 --> 00:51:31.050
were assigned, how people saw their gender, how they

947
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.489
experienced it and what they felt in their body.

948
00:51:34.379 --> 00:51:39.959
But increasingly so, um dysphoria is the word that

949
00:51:39.969 --> 00:51:47.520
is being um instrumental um utilized um misused in

950
00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:51.159
order to argue that there's something off about people

951
00:51:51.169 --> 00:51:53.620
who want to transition or to say that only

952
00:51:53.629 --> 00:51:56.280
people who have a certain degree of dysphoria should

953
00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:00.639
have access to um to gender affirming care. So

954
00:52:00.649 --> 00:52:02.320
you see, like, it's interesting to see how kind

955
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.520
of like those arguments kind of like, cut both

956
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:08.040
ways. Like, if you have too much dysphoria, it's

957
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.719
a problem and if you have too little, it's

958
00:52:09.729 --> 00:52:12.360
a problem. And that begins to, to point as

959
00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:14.600
to how dysphoria is a problematic term in that

960
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.520
context.

961
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.810
And I'll just add that. I, I think, you

962
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:23.100
know, dysphoria, either way, dysphoria includes a model. It

963
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:26.850
takes for granted a model of immutability. The anti

964
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.649
trans version of dysphoria is that a someone who

965
00:52:29.659 --> 00:52:33.030
should have been cysts because everyone is actually cysts,

966
00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.300
something has warped them such that they mistakenly think

967
00:52:37.449 --> 00:52:39.770
they're a different gender. So there's some so that,

968
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.129
but that mistake is itself a symptom. There's some

969
00:52:42.139 --> 00:52:45.830
so that um but here, dysphoria presumes the core,

970
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.129
the immutable core would be cyst. That is normative

971
00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:53.530
gendered. The, the transformative model is that dysphoria um

972
00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:56.850
indicates actually the difficulties and in fact, there are

973
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.860
real difficulties in living in the world as someone

974
00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.260
who's trans because we live in a transphobic world.

975
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:05.320
But dysphoria would then name like this discordance between

976
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.050
the, again the sex assigned at birth and the

977
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.145
gender one feels oneself to be um usually articulated

978
00:53:11.155 --> 00:53:13.264
through a born that way model, I've always been

979
00:53:13.274 --> 00:53:17.185
this way, we have to now fix this incongruity.

980
00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:19.014
So as to get rid of the dysphoria. But

981
00:53:19.024 --> 00:53:21.854
again, dysphoria, I think is built on a premise

982
00:53:21.864 --> 00:53:25.995
of immutability, whether an anti transversion or transforming version.

983
00:53:26.514 --> 00:53:28.344
So le let me ask you this and I

984
00:53:28.354 --> 00:53:31.655
know this is a very sensitive question. But since

985
00:53:31.665 --> 00:53:33.965
that idea is out there, I guess we also

986
00:53:33.975 --> 00:53:36.165
have to address it because when it comes to

987
00:53:36.175 --> 00:53:41.040
trans people nowadays, particularly from uh the American right,

988
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:44.520
and also the right wing in other countries, we

989
00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:49.510
have this very uh common idea that when it

990
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.709
comes to certain people and particularly when it comes

991
00:53:53.719 --> 00:53:57.895
to Children, identifying us rounds that there would be

992
00:53:57.905 --> 00:54:02.955
an element of social contagion to it. So according

993
00:54:02.965 --> 00:54:06.834
to the framework you bring into your book, would

994
00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:11.995
there be space for that kind of phenomenon or

995
00:54:12.004 --> 00:54:12.584
not?

996
00:54:12.844 --> 00:54:17.574
You know, this idea of contagion that somehow kids

997
00:54:17.584 --> 00:54:20.665
are catching transnet there, you know, because they're, they're

998
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:23.550
on, you know, basically a contagion by internet, a

999
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.879
contagion by again, a bad teacher, a contagion by,

1000
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:29.570
oh this other kid is trans. So maybe I

1001
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.800
am too, this is actually relying on what is

1002
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:36.260
a now discredited study um which causes this notion

1003
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:40.379
of rapid onset gender dysphoria. This this the paper

1004
00:54:40.389 --> 00:54:42.620
promoting that actually had to be retracted. It was

1005
00:54:42.629 --> 00:54:45.909
its methods were so um dubious and yet the

1006
00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:48.489
term has gained traction and it circulates with a

1007
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.419
kind of medical panache to it. See, even the

1008
00:54:51.429 --> 00:54:55.530
experts say um it's a contagion. Um We think

1009
00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.500
that also we, we would absolutely reject the notion

1010
00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:01.610
of contagion. Um But we do want to note

1011
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:05.219
the following. There may well be an increase in

1012
00:55:05.229 --> 00:55:08.239
the number of young people identifying as gender, non

1013
00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:11.830
conforming and identifying as trans. But we should not

1014
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.790
be surprised at that increase. Why the the psychotic

1015
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.209
model we're using um involves the idea that as

1016
00:55:21.219 --> 00:55:24.479
we make, we make sense of ourselves, we elaborate

1017
00:55:24.489 --> 00:55:27.929
ourselves. This is not a fully volitional process, but

1018
00:55:27.939 --> 00:55:30.860
we elaborate ourselves. We come to give names to

1019
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.770
ourselves, sometimes not the names our parents gave us,

1020
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.439
not the names society wants to assign to us,

1021
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.169
but we come to self theorize and self elaborate

1022
00:55:40.179 --> 00:55:46.439
drawing on existing cultural categories. And because there are

1023
00:55:46.449 --> 00:55:51.350
now in numerous cultural contexts, more categories, more names

1024
00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.189
for the ways we can do our gender, including

1025
00:55:54.199 --> 00:55:57.949
the name trans, including the name, gender, non binary.

1026
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:01.610
It of course makes sense that more Children having

1027
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.419
available those new or newly emergent vernaculars would use

1028
00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:10.290
those names to describe their experiences of embodiment, their

1029
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:14.020
experiences of themselves. But this is not a contagion.

1030
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:18.229
This is about the ongoing transformation of culture that

1031
00:56:18.239 --> 00:56:20.939
has come about in part through political struggle. It's

1032
00:56:20.949 --> 00:56:25.110
also about ongoing possibilities of self transformation in light

1033
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.520
of social changes. This isn't a 1 to 1

1034
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.719
thing. Oh you learned about trans. Now you think

1035
00:56:29.729 --> 00:56:32.830
you are, it's a much more complex interaction, right?

1036
00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.100
The contagion model assumes that something comes into you

1037
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.379
and Voila. There you are, you just think this

1038
00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:39.979
you are this, we, we're actually talking about a

1039
00:56:39.989 --> 00:56:43.949
much more complex interaction and the social matters, but

1040
00:56:43.959 --> 00:56:46.629
it doesn't matter in this again, 1 to 1

1041
00:56:46.639 --> 00:56:48.030
mono causal way.

1042
00:56:48.949 --> 00:56:52.689
Mhm I get it. Uh So let me ask

1043
00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:55.699
you now another kind of question. So when it

1044
00:56:55.709 --> 00:57:00.500
comes to the way you approach gender identity here

1045
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:04.729
and particularly the bit about trauma, uh I, I

1046
00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:08.889
wanted to ask you whatever way people deal with

1047
00:57:08.899 --> 00:57:13.850
their specific traumas, whether they are single events or

1048
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.350
whether they are ongoing experiences that they have throughout

1049
00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:21.399
their lives, whatever way they deal with it in

1050
00:57:21.409 --> 00:57:25.159
terms of, of how they express themselves uh on

1051
00:57:25.169 --> 00:57:28.870
the level of their gender identity, for example, is

1052
00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:32.899
there any one correct way of doing that? I

1053
00:57:32.909 --> 00:57:37.929
mean, uh if uh different people through their own

1054
00:57:37.939 --> 00:57:43.600
particular experiences get at different or develop different sorts

1055
00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:47.949
of gender identity? I mean, is there uh are

1056
00:57:47.959 --> 00:57:53.350
anyone doing anything wrong with their own gender identity?

1057
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.719
I guess that's what I'm asking you. I mean,

1058
00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:59.649
from a more uh let's say clinical perspective, I

1059
00:57:59.659 --> 00:58:00.159
guess.

1060
00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:03.040
Yeah, I, I think that's part of the implication

1061
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.870
as you're picking up on with where we're heading

1062
00:58:05.879 --> 00:58:07.610
and we talk about this in, in our, in

1063
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.909
our book quite a bit that if we go

1064
00:58:10.919 --> 00:58:13.639
with what one who's ex and was explaining earlier,

1065
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.040
there is no way to get your gender right.

1066
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.040
And there's no way to get your gender wrong.

1067
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.479
Like there's rightness and wrongness have nothing to do

1068
00:58:21.489 --> 00:58:25.649
with gender. There's no way to assess if somebody

1069
00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:27.699
is truly trans or if somebody is really a

1070
00:58:27.709 --> 00:58:31.580
woman sis or otherwise, like there's no way to

1071
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.919
pin gender to precision or actuality, in fact, if

1072
00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:40.149
anything. Um AND this is kind of like the

1073
00:58:40.159 --> 00:58:43.510
the really expansive and more radical proposition that we

1074
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.610
offer in our volume is that gender is a

1075
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.750
wildly improvisational process. And this is why actually, even

1076
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.290
though people stand under categories, like some people might

1077
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.899
say, I identify as a woman or identify as

1078
00:58:55.909 --> 00:59:00.060
a trans mask, uh non-binary person, like none of

1079
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:04.070
these categories includes in them kind of like homogeneous

1080
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:07.830
subjects. Like all women are women differently, all cis

1081
00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.860
women or trans women or kind of like non

1082
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.179
binary people. That's why you see so much variation

1083
00:59:14.189 --> 00:59:17.209
in gender, like they share some things but really

1084
00:59:17.219 --> 00:59:21.010
like every gender, there's, there's as many genders as

1085
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.429
there are people, even as we try to group

1086
00:59:23.439 --> 00:59:26.270
them in different categories to make this distinction. So

1087
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.290
obviously, I'm not saying that these distinctions are meaningless,

1088
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.459
but they are not as decisive or firm or

1089
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.709
tight as we imagine them to be.

1090
00:59:35.909 --> 00:59:37.729
And you know, in the very fact that these

1091
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:40.919
distinctions are not so tight, in fact, they're porous.

1092
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.169
I think this is part of what feeds the

1093
00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:47.120
current moral panic over trans kids and, and trans

1094
00:59:47.209 --> 00:59:51.010
adults as well. Because I think that for, for

1095
00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.090
many people, the prospect that, that there I'll say

1096
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.290
for many cis people, right? For many people who

1097
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.790
are normative gendered have experienced their gender as unchanging

1098
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.639
across their lifetime. I think that a trans person,

1099
01:00:03.649 --> 01:00:06.429
a non binary person could challenge some of their

1100
01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:09.149
own settled assumptions about their gender. I'm not saying

1101
01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:11.149
that suddenly someone who's normally gender is like, oh

1102
01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:13.080
my God, what if I'm trans too? Although people

1103
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.570
might, their trans panic might take the form of,

1104
01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.830
well, this person could change, maybe I could as

1105
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.850
well. But I think it, I think part of

1106
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.120
the panic is that it, it does something to

1107
01:00:23.129 --> 01:00:25.510
you to realize that, oh, what are all the

1108
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.610
ways in which I'm not exactly how I think

1109
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:31.699
I am like, what does it mean to, you

1110
01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:35.300
know, come reckon with all the ways in which

1111
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.739
even for someone who was assigned female at birth,

1112
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.780
who identifies comfortably or? So it feels to her

1113
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.949
with the category girl and then woman, right? Even

1114
01:00:44.959 --> 01:00:48.100
that person has undergone changes in her gender across

1115
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:52.129
her lifetime changes that also might be connected to

1116
01:00:52.189 --> 01:00:55.969
physiological changes of puberty. Maybe there was a pregnancy

1117
01:00:55.979 --> 01:00:58.520
then menopause, right? So we're not saying the body

1118
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.479
doesn't matter. We're not saying biology doesn't matter, but

1119
01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:03.500
it's not 1 to 1 in the ways it

1120
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:06.850
matters but I think that it's very scary to

1121
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.479
a lot of people to encounter the ways in

1122
01:01:08.489 --> 01:01:11.379
which not just the world is changing around them,

1123
01:01:11.409 --> 01:01:15.060
like, politically, socially, the world is changing around them.

1124
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:18.889
But actually they may not be exactly who and

1125
01:01:18.899 --> 01:01:21.159
how they think they are. That's can be frightening

1126
01:01:21.169 --> 01:01:22.600
for many people to encounter.

1127
01:01:23.149 --> 01:01:26.139
So let me ask you one last question. Then

1128
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:30.810
when it comes to reps, the hopes you would

1129
01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.469
have for your book. I mean, when it comes

1130
01:01:33.479 --> 01:01:37.300
to, I, if you were to decide in an

1131
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.699
ideal world, what sort of influence would the book

1132
01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:43.989
like this have on your uh psycho uh uh

1133
01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:49.439
psychoanalytic colleagues? Uh AND people like that, what would

1134
01:01:49.449 --> 01:01:53.520
you like basically for other psychoanalysts to take from

1135
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.600
this book? And in what ways would you love

1136
01:01:56.705 --> 01:02:01.824
for it to have an impact on how psychoanalytic

1137
01:02:01.834 --> 01:02:06.975
theory and psychoanalysts approach, the topics like gender identity?

1138
01:02:07.495 --> 01:02:10.534
Um I really appreciate this question and, and I

1139
01:02:10.544 --> 01:02:13.314
also appreciate that the vision and the hopefulness of

1140
01:02:13.324 --> 01:02:15.074
this question that our book could have that kind

1141
01:02:15.084 --> 01:02:17.084
of an impact, which of course we would love

1142
01:02:17.094 --> 01:02:20.379
for each case. Uh I mean, I think I

1143
01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:22.699
can think of three things at the moment and

1144
01:02:22.709 --> 01:02:24.649
I'm sure that Ann may have things to add

1145
01:02:24.659 --> 01:02:27.500
to that the first would be to begin to

1146
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:31.100
move away from this notion of gender identity. Um

1147
01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:34.280
And to become smarter and able to think more

1148
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:41.260
complexly about how people acquire their gender. Um PSYCHOANALYSIS

1149
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:44.580
has always had very, very elaborate theories about how

1150
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.520
CIS people become cis. I mean, it, it, it

1151
01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.760
has not seen itself as doing that. But, you

1152
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.639
know, we actually have a lot of theories about

1153
01:02:51.649 --> 01:02:54.719
how boys become boys and girls become girls and,

1154
01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:57.199
and was talking about that a little bit earlier.

1155
01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:00.010
So we want to extend that resource that of

1156
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:04.449
complexity to queer and trans people. The second is

1157
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:08.169
to begin to take seriously the ways in which

1158
01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:11.639
trauma is actually part of life and not the

1159
01:03:11.649 --> 01:03:14.870
thing that interrupts it. And this is not to

1160
01:03:14.879 --> 01:03:18.810
minimize that trauma is difficult or, or to say

1161
01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.590
that we should pull back from social justice movements.

1162
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.250
That's not what we're saying at all. It is

1163
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.959
to say that since trauma is inevitable, thinking in

1164
01:03:27.969 --> 01:03:30.870
ways that are more trauma, ahi rather than trauma,

1165
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.169
phobic thinking with ways about that have to do

1166
01:03:34.179 --> 01:03:36.909
more with what people do with their trauma and

1167
01:03:36.919 --> 01:03:40.229
how different kinds of self configurations arise out of

1168
01:03:40.239 --> 01:03:45.520
trauma without invalidating them without treating them as um

1169
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:50.219
as being uh illegitimate uh is very important. And

1170
01:03:50.229 --> 01:03:53.139
the third is to to begin to take more

1171
01:03:53.149 --> 01:03:55.939
seriously kind of like how much more brutal and

1172
01:03:55.949 --> 01:03:59.889
strange gender is than we realize. But gender is

1173
01:03:59.899 --> 01:04:02.800
very strange and all of our efforts to understand

1174
01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:05.979
it, to master it, to have some Dominion over

1175
01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:08.300
it, to control it, whether people try to control

1176
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:11.870
it through words or through categorization or through who

1177
01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:15.979
gets access or not. This is that gender as,

1178
01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:19.479
as uh Paulo Preciado says is always going to

1179
01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:23.169
mutate, you know, even when you feel you're kind

1180
01:04:23.179 --> 01:04:24.889
of like at the at the leading edge of

1181
01:04:24.899 --> 01:04:27.719
trying to understand something, it will always slip away

1182
01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:29.510
and that's not a bad thing. That's not a

1183
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.300
failure that has to do with the kind of

1184
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:35.169
like how with the mortality and the energy of

1185
01:04:35.179 --> 01:04:37.060
psychic life and of what it means to be

1186
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:37.870
alive.

1187
01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.870
I mean, I think this is also about flagging

1188
01:04:39.879 --> 01:04:41.010
and this is one of the things we hope

1189
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.120
it will do in the book, it flag the

1190
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:48.570
Experimentalism of gender. Um And that, that experimentalism um

1191
01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.830
is to be validated and given and given space

1192
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.739
for for however long that particular experiment lasts such

1193
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:58.040
that people are also allowed to change. If it's

1194
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.270
an experiment, one can change and change again. Um

1195
01:05:01.479 --> 01:05:04.080
We would say it's gender transition all the way

1196
01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:06.879
down, right? Um One thing that I want to

1197
01:05:06.889 --> 01:05:08.489
go back to something we talked about earlier is

1198
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.310
that um one of the strongest claims our book

1199
01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.760
makes and we make it over and over and

1200
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.229
over again in different kinds of language is that

1201
01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:18.330
there is nothing wrong with being queer or trans

1202
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.610
or gender non-binary. But even more importantly, there is

1203
01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.649
no wrong way to become queer or trans or

1204
01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:27.840
gender, non binary. That's we want this this is

1205
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.959
a really big takeaway. We want our book to

1206
01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:32.719
have and you know, I, I know you've raised

1207
01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.510
and we really appreciate this question. What would you

1208
01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.340
want? How would we wish psychoanalysts maybe put this

1209
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.129
book to work? You know, this is our book

1210
01:05:40.139 --> 01:05:43.040
also is standing on the shoulders of other psychoanalytic

1211
01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:46.669
thinkers who are trying to do queer and trans

1212
01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:49.239
affirmative work, right? So we're really grateful for that

1213
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.179
work. We also could not have written this book

1214
01:05:51.189 --> 01:05:54.139
without the resources of queer and trans studies. And,

1215
01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:57.040
and, and very importantly, queer and trans of color

1216
01:05:57.050 --> 01:06:01.000
critique. We needed these resources from outside psychoanalysis to

1217
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:04.209
help shake psychoanalysis up and make it more rethink

1218
01:06:04.219 --> 01:06:08.050
supple more accountable, right? Um But some of your,

1219
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.979
of your viewers might think well. Ok, great. This

1220
01:06:10.989 --> 01:06:13.429
is actually a book for psychoanalysts. We don't really,

1221
01:06:13.439 --> 01:06:14.629
at the end of the day, we don't kind

1222
01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:16.959
of care about psychoanalysis. We'll let them have this

1223
01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:21.189
conversation. Here's why your viewers should care about psychoanalysis

1224
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:25.649
because psychoanalysis cares about queer and trans people. Although

1225
01:06:25.659 --> 01:06:27.899
the way that psychoanalysis cares about queer and trans

1226
01:06:27.929 --> 01:06:31.179
people isn't so caring. What do I mean by

1227
01:06:31.189 --> 01:06:34.330
that, that in I'll speak about the United States,

1228
01:06:34.929 --> 01:06:39.459
anti trans, especially anti trans legislation and anti trans

1229
01:06:39.469 --> 01:06:42.860
policies that would bar access to gender affirmative care

1230
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:46.510
and in particular bar children's access to gender affirmative

1231
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.520
care. Much of this legal language, these bills, these

1232
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.409
proposed bills and even some legal opinions are undergirded

1233
01:06:54.419 --> 01:06:58.860
by, they refer to medical research. Much of this

1234
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:02.860
medical research is being done by psychoanalytic activists by

1235
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:08.060
psychoanalysts who oppose we would say oppose trans life,

1236
01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:12.770
especially um um have difficulties even acknowledging the reality

1237
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.879
of trans Children. So, um psychoanalysts are doing a

1238
01:07:17.889 --> 01:07:20.110
lot of mischief in the world right now in

1239
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.070
the United States, in Britain and Australia in other

1240
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.129
contexts too. I know better the English language publications

1241
01:07:26.139 --> 01:07:28.969
on this. But so unfortunately, psychoanalysis is being put

1242
01:07:28.979 --> 01:07:31.600
to use and weaponized against queer and trans people

1243
01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:34.610
and especially trans people right now. That's another reason

1244
01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.000
why we think we hope our book will do

1245
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.870
some work in the world was to show that

1246
01:07:38.879 --> 01:07:40.939
there are other kinds of psychoanalytic arguments that can

1247
01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:44.300
be made to promote queer and trans flourishing and

1248
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:49.330
arguments. We think that could maybe not get stuck

1249
01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.330
in the dead end of born that way, warped

1250
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.260
that way, right? We think that these particular debates

1251
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.780
are not happening, he helping queer and trans people

1252
01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:58.820
and are flourishing.

1253
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.169
So I think that's a great message to end

1254
01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:05.860
our conversation on and the book is again, gender

1255
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:08.870
without identity. I'm leaving a link to it in
