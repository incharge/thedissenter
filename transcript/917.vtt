00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.629
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.198
the Decent. I'm your host, Ricard Loops.

3
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.198
And today I'm joined by Doctor Dale Greenwald. He's

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.778
research associate in the laboratory of Dr Conrad La Bandera

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.059
, creator of fossil anthropoids in the Paleobiology department at

6
00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:20.750
the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. And today

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.859
we're focusing on his book, Remnants of Ancient Life

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.789
, The New Science of Old Fossils. So,

9
00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:29.850
Doctor Greenwald, welcome to the show. It's a

10
00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.179
pleasure to everyone. Thank you, Ricardo. Thank

11
00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:36.750
you for inviting me. So, before we get

12
00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:41.750
into the biomolecules, we go through in the book

13
00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.279
that uh can be preserved in or as fossils,

14
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.289
I guess we're, we're, we're going to get

15
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:52.380
into that just to introduce the topic. I mean

16
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.819
, when you find a fossil, first of all

17
00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.469
, what are the most common kinds of fossils that

18
00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:02.969
we expect to find? And when we do find

19
00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:07.338
them, what kinds of information can we usually expect

20
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:14.230
to gather from them? The classical definition of a

21
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.849
fossil, of course, is either an impression or

22
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.760
a compression of a uh organism that that died millions

23
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:30.079
of years ago. And uh from that fossil,

24
00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:33.959
we can gain a lot of information about the organism's

25
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:44.730
structure. And um if we can study similar fossils

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.808
, we can compare them and we can construct a

27
00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.150
phylogeny based simply on structure, which can give us

28
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.588
a lot of information about the evolution of those organisms

29
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.900
. But it, it's all based on, on

30
00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.980
what we can see visually the, the, the

31
00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.980
structure of the fossil itself. And that for hundreds

32
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.508
of years has defined what the science of paleobiology is

33
00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:15.169
. It's changing now. However, with the advent

34
00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:22.949
of ancient biomolecules. Mhm And I mean, how

35
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.479
are biomolecules reserved in fossils? Because I would imagine

36
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.618
that there are limits to this, correct? Absolutely

37
00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.439
. Yes, there are uh uh limits. For

38
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.770
example, DNA uh originally was, it was thought

39
00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:42.800
that it would be impossible for it to be preserved

40
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.960
. Um simply because it's a very um sensitive uh

41
00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.689
molecule and it, it's easily degraded. But now

42
00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:59.058
we have ancient DNA that's uh about 2 million years

43
00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:07.639
old. Proteins similarly are uh easily degraded. But

44
00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.719
in fact, um just this year, a new

45
00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.508
paper came out and now we have a protein that

46
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.219
is, I think 11 or 12 subunits long,

47
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.110
that is 6.3 million years old. This is relatively

48
00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:28.528
young, of course, uh compared to fossils that

49
00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.960
are hundreds of millions of years old. Uh And

50
00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:39.159
the methods by which ancient biome biomolecules are preserved is

51
00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:46.189
as varied as the uh fossils themselves. There isn't

52
00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:52.080
one particular mechanism for preservation. There are many um

53
00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:53.969
and we are simply lucky that uh a number of

54
00:03:53.979 --> 00:04:00.319
them work and provide us with uh these amazing fossil

55
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.270
records. But, uh, I mean, when

56
00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:09.919
it comes to the oldest biomolecules we found uh preserved

57
00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.710
, we're talking about at best units of millions of

58
00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.040
years. Right. That's what we're talking about here

59
00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:21.319
for, for DNA. And protein is relatively young

60
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.988
. But there are other um biomolecules, for example

61
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.108
, a chemical, uh broad category of chemicals called

62
00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:35.259
porphyrins. One of which is heme, the molecule

63
00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:41.209
in uh hemoglobin that, that binds and releases oxygen

64
00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.899
, that is a very important biomolecule. And it

65
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.548
is uh potentially um you know, hundreds of millions

66
00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:56.108
of years old. And in fact, uh the

67
00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:59.428
uh the people who are exploring Mars right now have

68
00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.858
instruments on the surface of MARS. And one of

69
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.988
the things they will do is to try to identify

70
00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:12.298
the molecule uh the porphyrin molecule. And so some

71
00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:15.949
biomolecules uh can in theory, perhaps be as much

72
00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.579
as a billion years old. Mhm. And to

73
00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:24.959
what extent would it be possible for us to get

74
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.879
a better understanding of the origins of life on earth

75
00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:36.939
by studying some of these preserved biomolecules. That's uh

76
00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:46.509
uh uh AAA difficult um project because life originated billions

77
00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.040
of years ago. Uh There, there is one

78
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:56.290
very interesting aspect of, of ancient biomolecules which involves

79
00:05:56.298 --> 00:06:02.298
something called ancient sequence reconstruction where we use computers,

80
00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.660
artificial intelligence. If you will to try to predict

81
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.778
what the sequence of DNA and proteins were hundreds of

82
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.899
millions, perhaps even billions of years ago. In

83
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:24.480
one study actually um came up with evidence that supported

84
00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:30.939
the origin of life at mid oceanic ridges where we

85
00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.488
have these structures called black smokers where very hot water

86
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.778
is being released from uh the uh inner portions of

87
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.048
the earth. And because of the warm temperatures uh

88
00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:50.250
there and because of all the nutrients that accumulate around

89
00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.269
those sites, there's al always been a theory that

90
00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:57.819
that in fact is where life originated. It did

91
00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.528
not originate on land, but rather at the mid

92
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.639
oceanic ridges and, and laboratories have used this technique

93
00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:15.088
of ancient ancestral reconstruction to show that um proteins that

94
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.100
may have existed at those sites functioned at very high

95
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:27.488
temperatures unlike the proteins we have today. And so

96
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.608
, one of the illustrative examples you explore in your

97
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:36.238
book about how uh biomolecules get preserved and some of

98
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.459
the fossils associated with them. And then of course

99
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.689
, the information you can gather by studying these biomolecules

100
00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.420
is the fossil of a blood enlarged mosquito. So

101
00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:50.100
, could you tell us a little bit about the

102
00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:58.600
story behind that fossil? We're all familiar with blood

103
00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:01.540
and gorge mosquitoes, right? We uh have watched

104
00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:05.509
them as they feel full of blood uh on our

105
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.858
arm or our hand, they're very, very delicate

106
00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:13.389
, delicate and uh one would never expect that such

107
00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:20.809
an organism would be preserved. But um the uh

108
00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.660
conditions under which the, the fossil insects were preserved

109
00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.540
at this site in Northwestern Montana were very, very

110
00:08:28.548 --> 00:08:37.210
unique in that the uh fossil insects uh were blown

111
00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.509
over or flew over the surface of a lake,

112
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:43.450
but they didn't simply fall into the water and sink

113
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.440
to the bottom of the lake. What we think

114
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.609
happened in, in many cases, perhaps not all

115
00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:52.918
, but in many cases, the surface of the

116
00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.678
water at that period of time was covered with a

117
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.678
layer of cyanobacteria. Uh an algal mat, some

118
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.710
people call it green slime and this material is very

119
00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:09.418
sticky. And so when a tiny insect would fall

120
00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:15.808
onto it, the insect would be trapped and the

121
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.210
algae or the cyanobacteria is uh photosynthetic. And so

122
00:09:20.219 --> 00:09:24.519
it grows towards the sun and as it continues to

123
00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:30.739
grow, it would surround and envelop the tiny insect

124
00:09:31.418 --> 00:09:35.070
and it would protect it uh from many of the

125
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.038
things that might otherwise destroy the insect. And once

126
00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:43.570
uh the temperature is cooled a little bit, that

127
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.090
layer of algae would sink to the bottom of the

128
00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:56.840
lake with the entombed insect and would continue to protect

129
00:09:56.849 --> 00:10:00.450
it. It it was very unique preservation conditions.

130
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.629
And so, um it in fact was able to

131
00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:09.279
preserve uh these blood and gorge mosquitoes. And it

132
00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:11.479
, in fact is the only place in the world

133
00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.210
where uh we have fossils of, of blood and

134
00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:20.678
gorge mosquitoes. When I first saw this fossil,

135
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.960
the first thing that came to mind was this in

136
00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:30.330
uh enlarged and very dark abdomen? And I thought

137
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.690
to myself, wow, might that be blood?

138
00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:39.769
And uh of course, thinking that it might be

139
00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:43.950
blood is very different than proving that it is blood

140
00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:48.769
. And uh we were very lucky in being able

141
00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:52.298
to uh be able to use modern technology to in

142
00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:56.119
fact prove that that fossil mosquito which was 46 million

143
00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:03.379
years old contained uh uh remnants of uh hemoglobin.

144
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.969
A. And so for the audience to get,

145
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:11.678
let's say, a better understanding of how you go

146
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.960
about studying these biomolecules. Could you tell us a

147
00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:20.259
little bit more about the sort of techniques that you

148
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:24.065
and your colleagues used in the particular case of the

149
00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:26.705
mosquito fossil? But we can also talk a little

150
00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:28.533
bit about that when it comes to other kinds of

151
00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:35.413
biomolecules and particularly when you studied the he molecule in

152
00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:41.369
this case, yes, the technology is very important

153
00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:48.989
. Uh One of the things that paleobiologist dislike are

154
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.639
techniques that require the destruction of the fossil in order

155
00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.960
to analyze it, right. And so we had

156
00:11:56.969 --> 00:12:03.119
two techniques available to us. Uh The first was

157
00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:07.989
called energy dispersive spectroscopy or E DS. And we

158
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.509
use that to demonstrate that there were very high levels

159
00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:20.080
of the metal iron in the abdomen of the mosquito

160
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.009
. It was absent from other parts of the mosquito

161
00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:26.428
or the surrounding rock. And, and the heme

162
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:31.129
molecule contains iron at its center and in fact,

163
00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:35.369
it's the iron molecule that attaches to and releases oxygen

164
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.820
. And so it's an integral part of the heme

165
00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:43.690
molecule. So knowing that there were large amounts of

166
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.658
iron there, we suspected that the heat molecule might

167
00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:52.109
also be there. And so we use a technique

168
00:12:52.119 --> 00:13:00.500
called uh um secondary secondary ion mass spectrometry, which

169
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:03.408
is non destructive. Uh It doesn't harm the fossil

170
00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:11.129
, but it um breaks uh tiny molecules into fragments

171
00:13:11.808 --> 00:13:18.190
and creates fingerprint patterns of, of fragments that we

172
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.399
can use to definitively identify the presence of small molecules

173
00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:26.269
. So those two techniques, both of them non

174
00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:31.090
destructive uh showed us that uh in fact, uh

175
00:13:31.099 --> 00:13:37.700
the porphyrin molecule, he was still there. And

176
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.779
so uh another kind of uh molecules uh that you

177
00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:46.158
talk about in the book uh are related to ancient

178
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.450
pigments. So, could you tell us how ancient

179
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:56.200
pigments are studied and by studying them, what can

180
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.918
we learn about a particular species? I think pigments

181
00:14:01.928 --> 00:14:07.038
probably are the most common of all ancient biomolecules that

182
00:14:07.048 --> 00:14:11.690
extend really into deep time, hundreds of millions of

183
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.869
years old. Yeah. Um They uh you have

184
00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:20.469
to be a a serious uh organic chemist in order

185
00:14:20.479 --> 00:14:24.399
to study them because you use um you know,

186
00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:31.769
very high tech instrumentation like infrared spectroscopy um and,

187
00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:37.129
and, and other techniques. But um if you

188
00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:43.658
have a specimen that uh is large enough and it

189
00:14:43.668 --> 00:14:48.210
is a destructive technology because you have to scrape off

190
00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:50.899
a bit of the uh molecule. In order to

191
00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:56.259
isolate the pigment. Uh using this these techniques,

192
00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:03.840
you can um um determine the the the exact structure

193
00:15:03.849 --> 00:15:07.019
, the organic structure of of these pigments. Some

194
00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:11.580
pigments, however, frustratingly are difficult to analyze.

195
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.899
For example, probably the most common pigment that we

196
00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:18.469
think about, especially when we think about what color

197
00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:24.519
the feathers of of T rex were um is melanin

198
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.759
and of course, melanin is, is responsible for

199
00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:35.048
all kinds of different uh pigmentation in many different animals

200
00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:37.719
, but melanin, despite the fact that it's very

201
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:43.719
common, it is very difficult to identify. It

202
00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:48.649
comes in a variety of structures and those structures are

203
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:56.269
really exceedingly large. And um in fact, a

204
00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:03.000
number of papers have been published where uh scientists attempt

205
00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:07.668
to uh identify melanin. But in fact, uh

206
00:16:07.678 --> 00:16:11.340
using, for example, mass spectrometry, they can

207
00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:17.538
only say that their data is suggestive of the presence

208
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.349
. Um So what scientists have turned to is a

209
00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:30.019
proxy, they are unable to identify the pigment itself

210
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.808
. And so they have used the shape and size

211
00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:41.489
of the tiny Granules that store melanin as a proxy

212
00:16:41.178 --> 00:16:45.548
. If a uh if one of the storage Granules

213
00:16:45.558 --> 00:16:48.830
is long and thin, as opposed to oval,

214
00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:53.489
they assign colors to it. And uh it's a

215
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.928
bit controversial. Um We're still not sure if that

216
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.139
is entirely accurate. A lot of pictures have been

217
00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:07.390
published of beautiful dinosaurs with green and orange and red

218
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:15.420
feathers but right now, um those are colors that

219
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.519
we think might have occurred. We, we don't

220
00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:23.729
have any definitive proof yet and we are also not

221
00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:27.628
sure about the degree of certainty we have when it

222
00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:33.178
comes to the color of their feathers and skin.

223
00:17:33.188 --> 00:17:34.108
Right? I mean, in the particular case of

224
00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:37.778
dinosaurs, people, people generally seem to be very

225
00:17:37.788 --> 00:17:41.489
fascinated by them and we see all of those depictions

226
00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:45.198
of dinosaurs with those bright colors. But we are

227
00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:51.667
not sure that they really add those sorts of colors

228
00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:55.049
that we see, right? That is absolutely correct

229
00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:56.759
. It is a very dino centric world that we

230
00:17:56.769 --> 00:18:00.729
live in. Everyone wants to know what the the

231
00:18:00.739 --> 00:18:03.529
dinosaurs look like and perhaps at some point in the

232
00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:07.608
future, we will. Mhm But when it comes

233
00:18:07.618 --> 00:18:12.910
to studying ancient pigments and uh perhaps gathering more information

234
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.858
about particular ex uh species that already went extinct?

235
00:18:18.108 --> 00:18:22.029
Uh Is it possible for us to perhaps learn a

236
00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:26.500
little bit more about what would have been their behavior

237
00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:30.088
through color patterns? For example. Yeah. Thank

238
00:18:30.098 --> 00:18:33.559
you Ricardo for, for, for asking that question

239
00:18:33.568 --> 00:18:41.199
because the whole reason we study ancient molecules is to

240
00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:48.098
try to learn not just about their evolution, that

241
00:18:48.108 --> 00:18:49.920
is the evolution of the organisms and their phylogeny,

242
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.000
but things like behavior and physiology. Uh it's very

243
00:18:56.009 --> 00:19:02.979
difficult to study these phenomena from uh simple rock structures

244
00:19:03.989 --> 00:19:10.318
. So for example, um um clinoids that lived

245
00:19:10.328 --> 00:19:11.799
in the ocean, hundreds of millions of years ago

246
00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:18.858
, like today's relatives of crinoids are often brightly colored

247
00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:22.449
, bright red. And, um, we have

248
00:19:22.459 --> 00:19:26.239
been able to show that, uh, these crinoids

249
00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:29.729
were in fact pigmented hundreds of millions of years ago

250
00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:33.969
and they probably served the same function that they serve

251
00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:38.289
today. And that is that many crinoids contain a

252
00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:45.979
poisonous molecule. And, um, which in some

253
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:48.848
cases is the pigment itself, but the pigment also

254
00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:53.910
serves as a warning sign and tells potential predators to

255
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.539
stay away, you know, don't eat me,

256
00:19:56.549 --> 00:20:03.529
I'm poisonous. And um it is that type of

257
00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:07.630
behavior that we could never be able to learn about

258
00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:11.269
if we were simply looking at the structure of the

259
00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:17.318
, of the organism. And a wonderful example of

260
00:20:17.328 --> 00:20:23.489
um learning about the physiology of an organism through study

261
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:30.250
of its pigments. Although in this case, uh

262
00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:34.618
the pigment is not something that um uh is displayed

263
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.838
on in, in, in the uh the skin

264
00:20:37.848 --> 00:20:40.358
of the organism. The, the porphyrins, the

265
00:20:40.368 --> 00:20:44.739
he molecule are also color, they are pigments.

266
00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:51.279
Uh the green color of, of leaves is due

267
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:56.130
to chlorophyll. Uh uh and and the uh porphyrin

268
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.078
molecule inside of, of uh of chlorophyll. And

269
00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.670
uh it's a pigment, it's green. So blood

270
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.059
is red, it's a pigment. And um scientists

271
00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:14.130
were able to actually isolate purified. Actually, they

272
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.309
were able to synthesize pure, pure hemoglobin from mammoth

273
00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:22.049
, 40,000 year old mammoth. And they were able

274
00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:27.170
to show that the hemoglobin in the mammoth 40,000 years

275
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.598
ago, functioned very differently from the way it functions

276
00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:37.608
today. It um is more able to release its

277
00:21:37.618 --> 00:21:44.039
oxygen at cold temperatures. And by so doing it

278
00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:48.009
, it keeps the peripheral uh uh structures of the

279
00:21:48.019 --> 00:21:52.209
mammoth warm, which it had to do back 40,000

280
00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:55.750
years ago when uh everything was in the middle of

281
00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:59.279
the ice ages. Whereas today's, for example,

282
00:21:59.289 --> 00:22:04.140
the Asian or African elephant, um the hemoglobin doesn't

283
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.608
like cold temperatures and refuses to release its oxygen at

284
00:22:07.618 --> 00:22:11.920
cold temperatures. So we, we have been able

285
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:18.588
to, to identify the biochemical basis for some physiology

286
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.880
of some albeit shallow time uh fossils, the the

287
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:30.608
mammoth and uh still on the topic of pigmentation in

288
00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:33.880
what ways can it be related to a mechanism like

289
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:42.750
sexual selection? Um I'm glad you asked that question

290
00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:45.660
because in fact, uh II I, I'm in

291
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:52.489
the process of doing some, some interesting um research

292
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.650
on some, this is not in the book Ricardo

293
00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.328
, this is new work um on something called female

294
00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:06.568
sexual display. And I think we all know it's

295
00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:07.880
I I in in, in the natural world,

296
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.239
it's almost always the males that have sexual displays.

297
00:23:14.098 --> 00:23:18.910
Um you know, the the bright colors and and

298
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.789
and the strutting around, you know, that kind

299
00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:25.108
of thing. And so the the existence of female

300
00:23:25.118 --> 00:23:30.789
sexual display is very interesting to behaviorists, scientists who

301
00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:36.068
study behavior, right? And in this particular case

302
00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:41.400
, we have um a type of fly where the

303
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:48.390
, the females have enlarged and very darkly pigmented wings

304
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.059
, which um, attracts the males, which is

305
00:23:53.068 --> 00:23:56.299
very important because the females do not feed. The

306
00:23:56.309 --> 00:24:02.098
only nutrition they get is when the male brings them

307
00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:04.568
, uh, some prey to feed on. And

308
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:07.920
while the female feeds on that prey, the,

309
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.250
the, the male mates with the female fly.

310
00:24:11.828 --> 00:24:17.578
And so here's a case where uh uh we have

311
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.189
in, in this work that I'm doing now,

312
00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:27.338
the first example, um uh in the fossil record

313
00:24:27.348 --> 00:24:33.500
of female sexual display. And it's based totally on

314
00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:37.229
the presence of pigments in the wings of those female

315
00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:41.380
flies. So here we can, we can trace

316
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.588
perhaps the evolution of that behavior as well as the

317
00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:52.420
presence of that uh um display behavior in, in

318
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.910
the fossil record. Does that, does that come

319
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.118
close to answering your, your question? Mhm Yes

320
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.799
, it does. And I have just one more

321
00:25:02.809 --> 00:25:07.180
question about pigments before we move on to other biomolecules

322
00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:08.189
that you also explore in the book. So,

323
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:14.618
uh can we study the evolution of color vision through

324
00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:22.209
pigmentation? Uh That's an interesting question. And given

325
00:25:22.219 --> 00:25:27.670
that um color vision is thought to have evolved hundreds

326
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.989
of millions of years ago. It is um it

327
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.130
, it's difficult. Um What we can do is

328
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:45.279
simply make the assumption that if there were colors hundreds

329
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:48.189
of millions of years ago, there must have been

330
00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:53.818
color vision, right? One way that we can

331
00:25:53.828 --> 00:26:00.348
try to estimate the age of color vision is by

332
00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:04.390
use, excuse me, of, of something called

333
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.309
the molecular clock, which was in invented by a

334
00:26:08.318 --> 00:26:14.289
very famous chemist polling uh you know, 60 years

335
00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:18.358
ago. And that is we can study the sequence

336
00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:23.910
of different species of organisms and we can use that

337
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:33.078
protein sequence to predict how those proteins changed back in

338
00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:36.630
time. And we can go hundreds of millions of

339
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.279
years back in time. And we can make predictions

340
00:26:41.078 --> 00:26:47.818
of when the molecules that are responsible for color visions

341
00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:52.449
, they're called options. We can make predictions about

342
00:26:52.459 --> 00:26:56.140
when they first occurred. Uh So on that level

343
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.910
, the answer to your question is, is,

344
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.299
is yes, we can make predictions about the evolution

345
00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:06.779
of color vision. But in terms of using the

346
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:10.199
actual fossil pigments, uh we have not made it

347
00:27:10.209 --> 00:27:14.400
there yet. And so now I would like to

348
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.430
move on to bio meals. And I have two

349
00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:22.430
big questions about the that kind of mole biomolecule.

350
00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:25.140
So first of all, what is the importance of

351
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:30.618
biomet for life itself? What kind of roles do

352
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.459
they play? I I think it's important that we

353
00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:41.848
all understand that uh metals uh those that are present

354
00:27:41.858 --> 00:27:45.618
in life forms, that is the biomeds are essential

355
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.449
for life without them. There would be no life

356
00:27:48.439 --> 00:27:57.039
and um metals can occur in elemental form that is

357
00:27:57.049 --> 00:28:00.650
a, a big nodule of pure iron or,

358
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.140
or pure copper, but usually they occur as metal

359
00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:11.039
salts. So for example, um bone is uh

360
00:28:11.088 --> 00:28:14.529
has calcium, which of course is a metal,

361
00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:18.049
but it's not elemental metal. It is a metal

362
00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:23.689
salt, uh calcium carbonate, calcium appetite. And

363
00:28:23.699 --> 00:28:30.779
in fact, most metals in living organisms are salts

364
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:34.289
of those metals. Um In some cases, we're

365
00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:40.318
not sure exactly what the structure of the metals were

366
00:28:40.328 --> 00:28:44.250
in some organisms. Uh For example, uh in

367
00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:48.989
the book, we talk about the discovery of ancient

368
00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:55.588
metals that strengthen and reinforce the jaws of, of

369
00:28:55.598 --> 00:29:00.199
insects and even the insects that live today, which

370
00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:03.338
still reinforce their jaws with metals. We still don't

371
00:29:03.348 --> 00:29:08.078
know what the structure of those metals is in those

372
00:29:08.088 --> 00:29:11.939
organisms. There's there's much yet to be to be

373
00:29:11.949 --> 00:29:18.229
learned. Um And because metals can be detected fairly

374
00:29:18.239 --> 00:29:22.430
easily and at very low levels and in non destructive

375
00:29:22.439 --> 00:29:27.689
uh ways, um biomeds is becoming a very important

376
00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:32.680
part of ancient biomolecule research. And I think we're

377
00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:36.880
gonna see more and more papers um about it.

378
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.578
And so, of course, uh again, I

379
00:29:40.588 --> 00:29:44.368
have to repeat this kind of question for biomet because

380
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.660
I think it's one of the most interesting parts of

381
00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.209
what you explore in the book when it comes to

382
00:29:49.219 --> 00:29:53.539
the different biomolecules. But what kinds of information can

383
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:56.868
we get from them? So for example, when

384
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.459
we talked about pigmentation, we've mentioned phylogenetic information,

385
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.959
behavioral information as well. In this case of biomedicals

386
00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:08.989
, I would imagine that physiological information is a very

387
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.180
evident uh sort of thing that we can get from

388
00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:15.459
them. So, but generally speaking, what can

389
00:30:15.469 --> 00:30:26.150
we learn by studying ancient biomeds? I would have

390
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:37.199
to um preface any answer with the observation that we

391
00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:41.578
really need to know more about biomeds in living organisms

392
00:30:41.809 --> 00:30:45.799
. OK. Um Before we can go on to

393
00:30:47.338 --> 00:30:52.299
uh ask intelligent questions about ancient organisms, the science

394
00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:56.449
is very new and uh very little work has been

395
00:30:56.459 --> 00:31:00.049
done actually on, on uh ancient biomeds. Other

396
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:07.309
than for example, he and um um other porphyrin

397
00:31:07.318 --> 00:31:17.459
metals um laboratories are investigating uh the structure of biomeds

398
00:31:17.469 --> 00:31:21.680
in living organisms. And they're discovering that mother nature

399
00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:25.009
is much more complicated than we ever thought it was

400
00:31:25.598 --> 00:31:30.539
and produces structures that we have uh as scientists have

401
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:33.269
, have never even dreamed about. So there's a

402
00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:37.568
lot to learn about biomeds and I think we have

403
00:31:37.578 --> 00:31:41.029
to uh do more work on, on living organisms

404
00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:45.459
before we can uh uh answer your question, Ricardo

405
00:31:47.848 --> 00:31:48.410
. OK. So, I mean, when it

406
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.269
comes to the several different possible things we could learn

407
00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:59.328
from biomedicals like for example, phylogenetic information, anatomical

408
00:31:59.338 --> 00:32:01.650
information, physiological, information, behavioral, and so

409
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.160
on. It's still very limited at this point,

410
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.939
at least. Yes. Uh I'm not sure to

411
00:32:08.949 --> 00:32:14.219
what degree we can learn very much about phylogeny,

412
00:32:14.229 --> 00:32:17.779
but we can definitely learn a lot about uh the

413
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:22.219
physiology of, of, of organisms based on the

414
00:32:22.229 --> 00:32:27.789
study of biomeds. Mhm. And so let's talk

415
00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:30.449
a little bit about proteins. Here. So what

416
00:32:30.459 --> 00:32:37.108
kinds of proteins get preserved in fossils? That's a

417
00:32:37.118 --> 00:32:42.598
great question. Um The um paper that just came

418
00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:49.108
out by a uh a scientist from the University of

419
00:32:49.118 --> 00:32:52.709
Turin in, in Italy. Uh De Marchi was

420
00:32:52.719 --> 00:32:58.519
the senior author of this paper uh extends uh the

421
00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:02.039
age of ancient biomolecules to uh over 6 million years

422
00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:09.568
. And the sequence they found had a very unique

423
00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:21.338
sequence of four negatively charged subunits. And um that

424
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.088
protein was isolated from the shell of a bird.

425
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:35.250
Almost all proteins are isolated are isolated either from bones

426
00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:40.880
, from teeth, from egg shells or from the

427
00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:50.068
shells of uh snails and gastropods. And um all

428
00:33:50.078 --> 00:34:00.338
of those environment have a calcium carbonate or calcium appetite

429
00:34:00.979 --> 00:34:06.449
, which is positively charged or has positive charges.

430
00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:10.280
And so proteins that are negative, that can bind

431
00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:14.000
to the positive charges in the bone, the teeth

432
00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.958
, the shells are those that are most likely to

433
00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:22.407
be preserved. And um now that's for deep time

434
00:34:22.418 --> 00:34:28.978
, fossils for shallow time and let's define shallow time

435
00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:34.280
as something like around uh maybe several million years old

436
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.688
. Um uh we can get uh more proteins and

437
00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:44.599
different types of proteins simply because they are young and

438
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.447
haven't degraded yet. And so our studies, for

439
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:53.259
example of um uh the ancestors of human, which

440
00:34:53.268 --> 00:34:59.039
rely on um fossil skeletons, uh we can get

441
00:34:59.048 --> 00:35:02.768
entire proteome. And by the di the definition of

442
00:35:02.778 --> 00:35:06.717
a proteome, of course, is the sequences of

443
00:35:06.728 --> 00:35:10.358
every protein in an organism. And so what we

444
00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:15.157
can learn from those is, is almost limitless.

445
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:19.750
And um so the answer to your question, Ricardo

446
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.369
uh very much depends on how old the specimen is

447
00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:31.510
. Um I think one of the uh directions where

448
00:35:31.648 --> 00:35:37.708
ancient uh biomolecule research will expand is in the area

449
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:45.168
of um uh marine mollusc shells, uh shells of

450
00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:50.389
gastropods and clams go back hundreds of millions of years

451
00:35:50.889 --> 00:35:52.139
. Most of them have been replaced. The,

452
00:35:52.148 --> 00:35:55.039
the shell material has been replaced with other type of

453
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:59.050
rock. But in many cases, they're still the

454
00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.519
same chemicals that, that made up the original shell

455
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:07.159
of the living organism. And those shells contain proteins

456
00:36:07.969 --> 00:36:09.389
and we just have to be able to work with

457
00:36:09.398 --> 00:36:13.119
them more. And I think what we will find

458
00:36:13.128 --> 00:36:15.659
uh are, are we're gonna find thousands of new

459
00:36:15.668 --> 00:36:22.369
sequences from, from that source. And OK,

460
00:36:22.378 --> 00:36:24.978
so let me ask you perhaps a few more questions

461
00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:29.628
about proteins because I think that there are many interesting

462
00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:31.628
things here that we could explore. But to what

463
00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:37.320
extent can we learn more about if the physiology of

464
00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:42.969
particular organisms by studying these preserved proteins? And,

465
00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.869
and I know that this is a very broad question

466
00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:49.478
because proteins are everywhere. I mean, they play

467
00:36:49.489 --> 00:36:52.869
all sorts of different roles and there's, I don't

468
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:57.128
know how many proteins out there in uh in biological

469
00:36:57.139 --> 00:36:59.708
, in organisms. Uh I mean, they're everywhere

470
00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:05.208
basically. But uh ca can we learn uh more

471
00:37:05.219 --> 00:37:09.610
about their physiology by studying these proteins. And perhaps

472
00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:12.510
, I don't know if you want to illustrate that

473
00:37:12.519 --> 00:37:15.519
with uh perhaps a few examples or not. Sure

474
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:20.918
the answer to your question. Caro is a uh

475
00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:24.918
yes with an exclamation point. Um And given that

476
00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:31.719
um most ancient proteins are isolated from uh shallow time

477
00:37:31.728 --> 00:37:36.780
fossils, those that are tens of thousands or hundreds

478
00:37:36.789 --> 00:37:39.168
of thousands of years old. And we can get

479
00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:46.188
their entire protium, the sequence of every protein in

480
00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:52.938
the organism. We can learn everything about their physiology

481
00:37:54.168 --> 00:38:00.389
. Um We can um determine, for example,

482
00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:10.429
that uh um some ancient humans or neanderthals, um

483
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.010
we um had an allergy to milk. Hm.

484
00:38:19.409 --> 00:38:22.769
That's, that's one tiny example. Um Their immune

485
00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.599
system was different. And in fact, uh uh

486
00:38:29.699 --> 00:38:35.719
all of us contain a little bit of uh DNA

487
00:38:35.728 --> 00:38:40.739
and proteins that we inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors,

488
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:46.800
right? And some of those proteins um affect our

489
00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:52.668
immune system and some of us are in fact more

490
00:38:52.679 --> 00:39:02.090
susceptible to catching the COVID virus. Mhm. Because

491
00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:07.010
of the presence of Neanderthal proteins in our bodies.

492
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.199
So, because we can, we can, we

493
00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:15.110
can uh isolate the entire protium of, of uh

494
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:22.478
many organisms of the answer to your question is that

495
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.469
it's, it's, it's a gold mine of,

496
00:39:27.478 --> 00:39:29.820
of, of work that we can do relative to

497
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:36.628
how the physiology of ancient humans and ancient organisms differed

498
00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:39.958
from from modern day humans and, and uh and

499
00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:45.110
other animals. Um you know, our studies of

500
00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:53.619
human evolution, homo sapiens migration from Africa, our

501
00:39:53.628 --> 00:39:59.199
studies of the genetics of the neanderthals. We've learned

502
00:39:59.208 --> 00:40:00.978
so much about that and yet we've just scratched the

503
00:40:00.989 --> 00:40:05.519
surface. Uh the future is going to be very

504
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.478
, very exciting um relative to our understanding of,

505
00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:15.929
of human evolution because of what we can learn about

506
00:40:15.128 --> 00:40:20.010
um or from proteins, about our behavior and,

507
00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:25.938
and physiology. And can we learn more about phylogenetics

508
00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:30.329
from ancient proteins? And I mean, uh uh

509
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.139
I, while I'm asking you this, I'm probably

510
00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:37.019
asking you two different types of questions. I mean

511
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.329
, if we can learn about phylogenetics directly from ancient

512
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:47.820
proteins or also indirectly uh uh learning more about genetics

513
00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:54.418
from proteins. The older the specimen is, the

514
00:40:54.429 --> 00:40:58.958
older the protein is, the more we can learn

515
00:40:59.438 --> 00:41:02.478
, it's all dependent on how far back we can

516
00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:09.599
isolate uh proteins and, and DNA from um the

517
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:16.929
construction of phylogeny and phylogenetics is, is um something

518
00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:27.320
that is um dependent. Mhm um um um having

519
00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:30.280
a lot of specimens from a lot of different periods

520
00:41:30.289 --> 00:41:32.559
of time, right? And the further back in

521
00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:37.458
time, the more phylogenetics we can do. Um

522
00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:43.128
and and right now, we're kind of limited by

523
00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:49.458
uh the fact that uh um ancient DNA and ancient

524
00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:52.878
ancient proteins don't go very far back in time.

525
00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:57.708
And this and this might be uh an appropriate time

526
00:41:57.719 --> 00:42:00.530
to bring up the work of Dr Mary Schweitzer who

527
00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:07.050
has uh uh published about the sequences from uh dinosaurs

528
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:08.349
that are hundreds of millions of years old or,

529
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.159
or hundreds of million years old. This work is

530
00:42:12.168 --> 00:42:16.239
, is very controversial. Um uh her work um

531
00:42:16.809 --> 00:42:22.280
is uh can't be reproduced by some of the laboratories

532
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.389
. Yeah. And so I think the consensus is

533
00:42:24.398 --> 00:42:29.559
that the oldest DNA is only about 2 million years

534
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.019
old. The oldest proteins are about 4 million years

535
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.639
old. Now, 6 million years old with the

536
00:42:35.648 --> 00:42:38.978
work from Italy, I think we all hope the

537
00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:43.458
doctors Switzer is correct. And that in fact,

538
00:42:43.469 --> 00:42:49.789
we can isolate proteins from dinosaurs because it would be

539
00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.438
wonderful to be able to do uh phylogenetics, reconstruct

540
00:42:54.449 --> 00:43:00.320
the phylogeny of dinosaurs and compare that work to the

541
00:43:00.329 --> 00:43:02.989
phylogeny we have made that are based simply on,

542
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.168
on structure. Mhm uh And so just before we

543
00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:14.699
get directly into ancient DNA, since you mentioned dinosaurs

544
00:43:14.708 --> 00:43:17.309
there briefly again. So uh one interesting thing that

545
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.168
I read about in your book is uh when we

546
00:43:21.179 --> 00:43:25.610
find dinosaur bones, sometimes it's not just the bones

547
00:43:25.619 --> 00:43:30.780
themselves that we can study, but also ancient blood

548
00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:34.059
vessels within them, right? So could, could

549
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.250
you tell us a little bit about that? Yes

550
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.619
, that, that is the work uh of,

551
00:43:38.628 --> 00:43:44.019
of Doctor Schweitzer. And she's very famous for uh

552
00:43:44.128 --> 00:43:46.280
showing all of us that you can take a dinosaur

553
00:43:46.289 --> 00:43:51.219
bone. And when you dissolve all the minerals you

554
00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:55.668
are left over with this uh soft tissue, it

555
00:43:55.679 --> 00:44:00.039
almost looks like uh a tiny little piece of,

556
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:04.570
of, of, of meat. And uh within

557
00:44:04.579 --> 00:44:07.699
that material, you can isolate structures that very much

558
00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:14.458
look like blood vessels. OK. And um this

559
00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:19.050
work uh has been repeated by many, many different

560
00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:22.699
laboratories. Um I have been able to repeat this

561
00:44:22.708 --> 00:44:29.059
work myself in the lab. And um the,

562
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.320
the, the problem is what is that material made

563
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:36.800
of? And if in fact, it is made

564
00:44:36.809 --> 00:44:40.199
of, of protein and DNA can we isolate it

565
00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:45.699
intact. And that is the big controversy. Some

566
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:51.610
people say no, some people say yes. So

567
00:44:51.619 --> 00:44:57.010
talking then about ancient DNA, how well does it

568
00:44:57.019 --> 00:45:02.409
get preserved? And in what kinds of structures again

569
00:45:02.478 --> 00:45:07.550
, uh almost all ancient DNA comes from bones or

570
00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:14.239
teeth. Mhm. Um There is something called environmental

571
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.449
DNA. OK, where people would just take a

572
00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:21.458
shovel full of dirt from the bottom of a cave

573
00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:25.728
and they can isolate DNA, which is very surprising

574
00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:30.199
given given how, how fragile a molecule it is

575
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.719
. But most ancient DNA is isolated from, from

576
00:45:34.728 --> 00:45:40.679
bones and teeth. And um in some cases,

577
00:45:40.688 --> 00:45:45.860
if the uh specimen is young enough, we can

578
00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:50.969
get the entire genome. Uh the genome being all

579
00:45:50.978 --> 00:45:57.090
of the uh DNA from a particular organism. And

580
00:45:57.099 --> 00:46:00.750
uh again, I if we have that kind of

581
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:08.228
information, um we can determine a great deal of

582
00:46:08.239 --> 00:46:13.340
, of, of uh things about the behavior physiology

583
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:16.530
, phylogeny of that organism. It all depends on

584
00:46:16.539 --> 00:46:27.010
, on its age. Um the um oldest DNA

585
00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:30.329
, I think is about 2 million years old and

586
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.579
it's only fragmentary and it's uh it's uh fairly difficult

587
00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.340
to do uh any uh in depth uh work on

588
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:44.849
phylogenetics with something that is that fragmentary. Um I'm

589
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.969
not sure I answered your question, Ricardo. Uh

590
00:46:45.978 --> 00:46:49.148
Please restate the question if, if, if I

591
00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:52.500
didn't uh yes. One part of the question that

592
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.280
perhaps uh you didn't answer directly, I think is

593
00:46:57.289 --> 00:47:00.219
how well it gets uh preserved. I mean,

594
00:47:00.228 --> 00:47:05.119
is it easy for it to get preserved in ancient

595
00:47:05.128 --> 00:47:08.728
DNA or not? Yeah. So, uh uh

596
00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:13.869
again, it's dependent on the age of the specimen

597
00:47:14.378 --> 00:47:19.070
and the younger the age, um it can be

598
00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:23.309
preserved entirely intact, beautifully preserved and, and the

599
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:30.679
older we go, the less uh uh there is

600
00:47:30.978 --> 00:47:32.878
and the more fragmentary it is. So, everything

601
00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:37.639
depends on age. I think ancient DNA, depending

602
00:47:37.648 --> 00:47:44.079
on how we define ancient, has drastically changed.

603
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:50.478
Uh the sciences of anthropology and archaeology because those,

604
00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:53.989
those two sciences work in the realm of, of

605
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.260
um shallow time specimens that are 1000 years old or

606
00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:06.449
5000, 10,000, 100,000 years old. And DNA

607
00:48:06.639 --> 00:48:15.208
uh is beautifully preserved uh under many conditions um in

608
00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:17.438
specimens that are just uh you know, tens of

609
00:48:17.449 --> 00:48:21.918
thousands of years old. And, and, and

610
00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:25.599
uh i it's a near infinite amount of information that

611
00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:30.909
we can obtain from uh from those specimens. But

612
00:48:30.918 --> 00:48:32.148
, but again, that's not in the field of

613
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:37.559
, of paleobiology. That's more anthropology and, and

614
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:42.820
uh and archaeology. A good example is our understanding

615
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:49.949
of the evolution of the um uh the Black death

616
00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:57.938
or the um um bubonic plague which first appeared in

617
00:48:57.949 --> 00:49:01.250
the early 13 hundreds. And we were able to

618
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:07.099
isolate DNA from uh people who, who the skeletons

619
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:09.269
of people who died from the Black death. And

620
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.648
we were able to uh study the uh evolution of

621
00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:21.978
that virus and even determine when in fact, uh

622
00:49:21.989 --> 00:49:27.820
it underwent a mutation to become uh terribly pathogenic.

623
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.599
So, yeah, it's a the the the future

624
00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:37.438
of of shallow time DNA is uh um you know

625
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.199
, it's gonna be very exciting to see what,

626
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:44.728
what happens here in the future. So if I

627
00:49:44.739 --> 00:49:49.128
understand it correctly, the amount of information that we

628
00:49:49.139 --> 00:49:53.809
can potentially get from ancient DNA is so much and

629
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.280
so varied, that's probably one of the reasons why

630
00:49:58.289 --> 00:50:02.438
many people usually refer to ancient DNA as the holy

631
00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:07.478
grail of ancient biomolecules, right. Yeah. Yeah

632
00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:14.510
. Um DNA, of course, um encodes proteins

633
00:50:15.449 --> 00:50:19.668
and so much of the genetic information from DNA is

634
00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:22.869
present in proteins, but there is a lot of

635
00:50:22.878 --> 00:50:28.289
genetic information that is in DNA only. Um And

636
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.869
it is uh I think uh easier to do phylogenetic

637
00:50:32.878 --> 00:50:38.208
reconstruction using DNA than it is uh protein. So

638
00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:44.510
, there are distinct advantages to using DNA. Um

639
00:50:44.869 --> 00:50:46.969
We just have to figure out how to uh uh

640
00:50:46.978 --> 00:50:51.878
extract it more effectively and, and more efficiently from

641
00:50:51.889 --> 00:50:55.938
older specimens. And at this point in time,

642
00:50:55.949 --> 00:51:00.889
do we have any idea at all about when DNA

643
00:51:00.898 --> 00:51:05.728
might have first originated on earth? At least?

644
00:51:07.918 --> 00:51:13.829
No, that, uh it's a sh a short

645
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.478
question or a short answer to a very complicated question

646
00:51:16.809 --> 00:51:22.949
. Um People think it may, uh, well

647
00:51:22.958 --> 00:51:28.679
, in fact, we have fossils of single celled

648
00:51:28.688 --> 00:51:34.119
organisms that are over a billion years old. Billion

649
00:51:34.128 --> 00:51:36.918
with A B. And so we know there was

650
00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:39.668
life on earth that is a, a billion,

651
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:45.519
perhaps 2 billion years old. And we have to

652
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:51.869
assume that because life was able to reproduce even back

653
00:51:51.878 --> 00:51:57.809
then, that there is a uh DNA based mechanism

654
00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.989
for reproduction. Uh So we have to assume that

655
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.250
DNA evolved at least 2 billion years ago, probably

656
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:15.079
longer. Um But we don't know how and we

657
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:19.550
don't know exactly when there are some, a scientist

658
00:52:19.978 --> 00:52:24.309
who believed that it was not DNA, that was

659
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.128
the basis of original life forms, but in fact

660
00:52:29.139 --> 00:52:30.889
RN A, right. Uh But again, there

661
00:52:30.898 --> 00:52:34.760
, there's no way to uh no way to prove

662
00:52:34.769 --> 00:52:37.648
that RN A is, in fact, even more

663
00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:44.128
fragile than, than DNA. And it's very unlikely

664
00:52:44.139 --> 00:52:47.309
that we will ever be able to recover ancient RN

665
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.030
A. Uh So at least at this point in

666
00:52:52.039 --> 00:52:55.978
time, it's not possible to get RN A from

667
00:52:55.989 --> 00:53:02.070
fossils, right? Oh, ok. Uh And

668
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:05.519
uh I mean, before we get into other topics

669
00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.309
, let me just ask you one more question.

670
00:53:07.728 --> 00:53:13.309
Um How much can we learn about the ancestry of

671
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.309
our own species through ancient DNA? Because, you

672
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.208
know, there's always this sort of very interesting questions

673
00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:25.159
or questions that people are usually very interested about particularly

674
00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:30.324
paleoanthropology and people like that about, for example,

675
00:53:30.333 --> 00:53:36.175
our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and Bonobos and the

676
00:53:36.184 --> 00:53:39.675
, our exact monin lineage and all of that.

677
00:53:39.684 --> 00:53:45.034
So can we can ancient DNA help us answer those

678
00:53:45.043 --> 00:53:47.579
kinds of questions? Yeah, I'm looking for uh

679
00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:51.360
a book up on my bookshelf here. Uh uh

680
00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:57.438
Robert Reich uh wrote a book about that. And

681
00:53:57.449 --> 00:54:00.250
in fact, many books have been written uh about

682
00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:05.809
the uh phylogeny, the evolution of not just Homo

683
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.260
sapiens but our ancestors and not just our most recent

684
00:54:09.269 --> 00:54:15.250
ancestors, the Neanderthal, but the homo erectus and

685
00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.539
uh you know, way back uh uh to uh

686
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:24.918
over a million years old. Um The amount of

687
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:32.849
information that we can obtain from our studies of um

688
00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:39.228
ancient DNA, from the genus Homo. It is

689
00:54:39.239 --> 00:54:44.628
mind boggling. There is so much we can learn

690
00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.889
. And again, it's not just phylogenetics, it's

691
00:54:46.898 --> 00:54:52.389
behavioral, it's physiological. Um As I mentioned,

692
00:54:52.398 --> 00:54:57.750
there are many books written about this already. Uh

693
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.969
and there will be many more, we've barely scratched

694
00:55:00.978 --> 00:55:05.909
the surface. Uh There are so many different questions

695
00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:12.090
. Um It is an area that um I did

696
00:55:12.099 --> 00:55:15.550
not cover to any great extent in the book because

697
00:55:15.559 --> 00:55:19.849
I am not an expert on, on, on

698
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.570
DNA. And so uh I'm proud of the fact

699
00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:27.579
that I know what I don't know. And uh

700
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.648
so II I leave it to, to other experts

701
00:55:30.989 --> 00:55:36.110
uh to tell you about um the uh the work

702
00:55:36.119 --> 00:55:39.809
with ancient DNA. But uh it will revolutionize science

703
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:45.260
and it will revolutionize our understanding of, of the

704
00:55:45.269 --> 00:55:49.648
evolution of, of our own species. So,

705
00:55:49.659 --> 00:55:52.530
uh I mean, throughout the entire interview, we've

706
00:55:52.539 --> 00:55:57.090
been focusing a lot on animals. But what about

707
00:55:57.099 --> 00:56:00.449
plants, what have we learned about, for example

708
00:56:00.458 --> 00:56:04.918
, early plant life and the evolution of plants through

709
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:12.579
an ancient biomolecules. Unfortunately, the answer is almost

710
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:17.208
nothing and the reason uh that we have learned so

711
00:56:17.219 --> 00:56:23.708
little from plants and II I, I'm not trying

712
00:56:23.719 --> 00:56:29.949
to be um uh facetious or, or comical here

713
00:56:30.389 --> 00:56:36.110
is that plants don't have bones and that's where we

714
00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:37.570
get all of our ancient DNA and all of our

715
00:56:37.579 --> 00:56:44.860
ancient protein plants are made of soft tissue, which

716
00:56:44.869 --> 00:56:50.090
is very easily degraded. Uh There is almost nothing

717
00:56:50.769 --> 00:56:55.800
in the scientic scientific literature on plant DNA because it

718
00:56:55.809 --> 00:57:00.059
just degrades so very, very quickly. There is

719
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:05.329
a little bit about um uh plant protein, but

720
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:09.878
it's uh only a few 1000 years old. The

721
00:57:09.889 --> 00:57:16.260
most we know about ancient biomolecules from plants is based

722
00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:23.128
on uh what we call small molecules. Uh And

723
00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.958
even that doesn't go very far back in time,

724
00:57:25.969 --> 00:57:30.739
let me define small molecules by giving some examples.

725
00:57:31.188 --> 00:57:39.809
Um We have all made extracts of plants usually using

726
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:47.250
hot water uh that contain small molecules like uh caffeine

727
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:51.909
, for example, from the coffee bean and from

728
00:57:51.918 --> 00:57:57.780
tea leaves, there are literally tens of thousands of

729
00:57:57.789 --> 00:58:01.989
small molecules that are unique to plants. Uh think

730
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.789
of all the uh hallucis hallucinogenic uh drugs, for

731
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:13.530
example, um Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid is uh a

732
00:58:13.539 --> 00:58:16.449
small molecule that you can isolate from plants. All

733
00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:20.309
of these are unique to plants. They're not present

734
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:25.090
in animals and they can be preserved in, in

735
00:58:25.099 --> 00:58:30.409
plants that go back uh many millions of years.

736
00:58:30.219 --> 00:58:34.519
And in fact, uh at one point in time

737
00:58:35.139 --> 00:58:39.570
, some scientists proposed that we study phylogenetics based on

738
00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:45.639
the presence of those small molecules. So I guess

739
00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:50.280
the term phylogenetics wouldn't be the the appropriate term.

740
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.039
Um but it would be AAA way to study the

741
00:58:55.050 --> 00:59:02.438
evolution of plants based on their small molecules. And

742
00:59:02.449 --> 00:59:07.800
um so you would take a fossil leaf and you

743
00:59:07.809 --> 00:59:10.239
would scrape it off of a rock and you would

744
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:14.360
extract it just like you would extract a tea leaf

745
00:59:15.119 --> 00:59:16.510
and from that extract, you would be able to

746
00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:21.889
isolate tiny molecules, some of which may be unique

747
00:59:21.898 --> 00:59:25.458
to that particular plant. And so you could differentiate

748
00:59:25.469 --> 00:59:30.250
one plant from another. Uh You could actually do

749
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:37.378
taxonomy based on the presence of uh small molecules that

750
00:59:37.389 --> 00:59:44.750
are unique to individual plants. That chemo taxonomy,

751
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.418
let's call it that, let's give it that name

752
00:59:46.429 --> 00:59:51.860
chemo taxonomy. Uh never caught on it, it

753
00:59:51.869 --> 00:59:54.010
is not really used at all in, in modern

754
00:59:54.019 --> 00:60:01.228
plant taxonomy, but um it does uh exist simply

755
00:60:01.239 --> 00:60:07.789
because of the presence of um these small molecules and

756
00:60:07.800 --> 00:60:10.188
plants for, for literally tens of millions of years

757
00:60:12.989 --> 00:60:16.829
. So I have two final general questions, let's

758
00:60:16.840 --> 00:60:22.449
say to ask you. So, potentially how much

759
00:60:22.458 --> 00:60:28.789
of the phylogeny and ancient physio of the total biomass

760
00:60:28.800 --> 00:60:31.159
of the earth? Can we or could we get

761
00:60:31.168 --> 00:60:37.250
a good understanding of through ancient genomes, proteins?

762
00:60:37.260 --> 00:60:44.929
And of course, other biomolecules, we don't know

763
00:60:45.760 --> 00:60:50.260
. Um I think it's um uh most of us

764
00:60:50.800 --> 00:60:55.898
should appreciate that 90% of all the species of organisms

765
00:60:55.909 --> 00:61:00.369
that have ever lived on earth are now extinct.

766
00:61:01.739 --> 00:61:06.840
And so that means that 90% of everything we have

767
00:61:06.849 --> 00:61:12.469
to we have uh to learn from is in the

768
00:61:12.478 --> 00:61:15.188
fossil record, right? And so potentially there's a

769
00:61:15.199 --> 00:61:21.639
huge amount we can learn. We're limited only by

770
00:61:21.648 --> 00:61:27.989
the uh preservation or the lack of preservation of the

771
00:61:28.000 --> 00:61:30.769
uh chemicals, whether they're DNA or protein pigments or

772
00:61:30.780 --> 00:61:42.010
small molecules. I think paleobiology will change over the

773
00:61:42.019 --> 00:61:46.159
next uh few years. And uh uh they will

774
00:61:46.168 --> 00:61:53.110
take ancient biomolecules research to heart and more young people

775
00:61:53.119 --> 00:61:57.849
, I think uh are becoming very interested in ancient

776
00:61:57.860 --> 00:62:00.119
biomolecule research and I think it will, it,

777
00:62:00.128 --> 00:62:05.079
it is a new and, and rapidly growing field

778
00:62:05.590 --> 00:62:07.289
. Um, there's a huge amount of potential.

779
00:62:07.780 --> 00:62:12.070
Um, but II, I certainly can't put a

780
00:62:12.079 --> 00:62:15.050
uh a number on it right now, Ricardo,

781
00:62:15.059 --> 00:62:16.320
I wish I could. But, uh, uh

782
00:62:16.898 --> 00:62:21.659
, again, we're, uh, um, despite

783
00:62:21.668 --> 00:62:23.809
the fact that we might, um, publish a

784
00:62:23.820 --> 00:62:25.809
lot and think we know a lot. Uh,

785
00:62:25.820 --> 00:62:30.619
we're, we're, we're pretty ignorant about the evolution

786
00:62:30.628 --> 00:62:32.909
of life on earth. That's fair enough. And

787
00:62:32.918 --> 00:62:36.168
, uh, that also makes for a good segue

788
00:62:36.239 --> 00:62:38.418
to my last question. And you've already talked a

789
00:62:38.429 --> 00:62:42.280
little bit about this. But how do you look

790
00:62:42.289 --> 00:62:45.889
at the future of the study of ancient biomolecules and

791
00:62:45.898 --> 00:62:49.780
the information we can potentially get from them? I

792
00:62:49.789 --> 00:62:52.360
mean, are there any predictions you would make?

793
00:62:52.369 --> 00:62:57.938
Are there for example, any exciting new developments that

794
00:62:57.949 --> 00:63:02.398
you're seeing? I think the the the most exciting

795
00:63:02.409 --> 00:63:08.750
development uh in the field of ancient biomolecular research has

796
00:63:08.760 --> 00:63:14.849
nothing to do with fossils. And that's because it

797
00:63:14.860 --> 00:63:21.590
is a science called ancient sequence reconstruction where we use

798
00:63:21.599 --> 00:63:28.958
um computers to predict the sequence of ancient proteins or

799
00:63:28.969 --> 00:63:35.208
ancient DNA. Mhm. And this interestingly and perhaps

800
00:63:35.219 --> 00:63:43.519
surprisingly is most commonly used in uh drug discovery in

801
00:63:43.530 --> 00:63:47.260
uh by, by pharmaceutical companies because they want to

802
00:63:47.269 --> 00:63:53.300
understand the evolution of disease. They want to understand

803
00:63:53.309 --> 00:64:01.789
the evolution of proteins that uh cause various diseases.

804
00:64:01.918 --> 00:64:08.628
And we can try to predict using this computer based

805
00:64:09.188 --> 00:64:13.610
uh science of ancient sequence construction, we can try

806
00:64:13.619 --> 00:64:21.619
to uh determine how proteins that cause disease differed back

807
00:64:21.628 --> 00:64:25.849
in time and what happened to them to make them

808
00:64:25.949 --> 00:64:29.750
uh cause disease. And this will give us a

809
00:64:29.760 --> 00:64:32.458
basis for developing drugs that will help us to,

810
00:64:32.469 --> 00:64:34.978
to treat those diseases. So, in a way

811
00:64:34.989 --> 00:64:39.019
here, we're talking about drug discovery and we're supposed

812
00:64:39.030 --> 00:64:41.820
to be talking about ancient proteins. But I think

813
00:64:41.829 --> 00:64:45.090
believe it or not, the two are related that

814
00:64:45.099 --> 00:64:48.168
that's amazing. Uh And so let's perhaps end on

815
00:64:48.179 --> 00:64:50.949
that note then. And the book is again,

816
00:64:50.958 --> 00:64:55.188
Remnants of Ancient life, the New Science of old

817
00:64:55.199 --> 00:64:57.869
fossils. I'm leaving a link to it in the

818
00:64:57.878 --> 00:65:00.869
description of the interview. And Doctor Greenwald just before

819
00:65:00.878 --> 00:65:03.128
we go apart from your book, would you like

820
00:65:03.139 --> 00:65:06.409
to tell people where they can find your work on

821
00:65:06.418 --> 00:65:11.250
the internet? Yes. The, the, the

822
00:65:11.260 --> 00:65:15.418
book is published by uh Princeton University Press and they

823
00:65:15.429 --> 00:65:20.550
can be purchased at their website. And um one

824
00:65:20.559 --> 00:65:24.889
thing I would like to say is that uh all

825
00:65:24.898 --> 00:65:29.539
of uh my profits such as they are uh go

826
00:65:29.550 --> 00:65:33.769
directly to the uh the Library of the Natural History

827
00:65:33.780 --> 00:65:39.090
Museum in uh at the Smithsonian. And so,

828
00:65:39.099 --> 00:65:41.978
uh if anyone in fact does purchase a book,

829
00:65:42.239 --> 00:65:45.579
uh uh they will be able to in doing so

830
00:65:45.590 --> 00:65:49.978
contribute to the libraries. Um So, yeah,

831
00:65:49.989 --> 00:65:58.208
II, I wish um um that um I could

832
00:65:58.228 --> 00:66:03.199
uh uh sign everyone's book uh based uh through the

833
00:66:03.208 --> 00:66:06.010
zoom session. But uh I guess that's not technically

834
00:66:06.019 --> 00:66:10.989
possible yet. But uh yeah, I, I

835
00:66:11.000 --> 00:66:14.809
uh I hope that uh uh people would find that

836
00:66:14.820 --> 00:66:17.329
it is an enjoyable read. No, let me

837
00:66:17.340 --> 00:66:23.000
just say myself that I found it uh really fascinating

838
00:66:23.010 --> 00:66:25.329
read. I really love the book and I hope

839
00:66:25.340 --> 00:66:29.449
that everyone in my audience runs and buys it.

840
00:66:29.458 --> 00:66:30.989
It's very interesting. So, thank you so much

841
00:66:31.000 --> 00:66:33.820
