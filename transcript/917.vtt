00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.809
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.809
Decent. I'm your host, Ricard Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.470
joined by Doctor Dale Greenwald. He's research associate in

4
00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.970
the laboratory of Dr Conrad La Bandera, creator of

5
00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:17.270
fossil anthropoids in the Paleobiology department at the Smithsonian's

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.559
National Museum of Natural History. And today we're focusing

7
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.290
on his book, Remnants of Ancient Life, The New

8
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:29.329
Science of Old Fossils. So, Doctor Greenwald, welcome to

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.969
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.109
Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you for inviting me.

11
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:40.349
So, before we get into the biomolecules, we go

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.509
through in the book that uh can be preserved

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.659
in or as fossils, I guess we're, we're, we're

14
00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:50.549
going to get into that just to introduce the

15
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.409
topic. I mean, when you find a fossil, first

16
00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:58.419
of all, what are the most common kinds of

17
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.259
fossils that we expect to find? And when we

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.779
do find them, what kinds of information can we

19
00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:09.900
usually expect to gather from them?

20
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.900
The classical definition of a fossil, of course, is

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.279
either an impression or a compression of a uh

22
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.680
organism that that died millions of years ago. And

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.980
uh from that fossil, we can gain a lot

24
00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:38.569
of information about the organism's structure. And um if

25
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.489
we can study similar fossils, we can compare them

26
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.830
and we can construct a phylogeny based simply on

27
00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:54.199
structure, which can give us a lot of information

28
00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.830
about the evolution of those organisms. But it, it's

29
00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:00.519
all based on, on what we can see visually

30
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.959
the, the, the structure of the fossil itself. And

31
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.270
that for hundreds of years has defined what the

32
00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:14.369
science of paleobiology is. It's changing now. However, with

33
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.139
the advent of ancient biomolecules. Mhm

34
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.389
And I mean, how are biomolecules reserved in fossils?

35
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.300
Because I would imagine that there are limits to

36
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.759
this, correct?

37
00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.320
Absolutely. Yes, there are uh uh limits. For example,

38
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.919
DNA uh originally was, it was thought that it

39
00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:43.940
would be impossible for it to be preserved. Um

40
00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:51.190
SIMPLY because it's a very um sensitive uh molecule

41
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.630
and it, it's easily degraded. But now we have

42
00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.570
ancient DNA that's uh about 2 million years old.

43
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.800
Proteins similarly are uh easily degraded. But in fact,

44
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.720
um just this year, a new paper came out

45
00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:14.910
and now we have a protein that is, I

46
00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:21.300
think 11 or 12 subunits long, that is 6.3

47
00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:26.399
million years old. This is relatively young, of course,

48
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.080
uh compared to fossils that are hundreds of millions

49
00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:35.389
of years old. Uh And the methods by which

50
00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:41.820
ancient biome biomolecules are preserved is as varied as

51
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.850
the uh fossils themselves. There isn't one particular mechanism

52
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.759
for preservation. There are many um and we are

53
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.990
simply lucky that uh a number of them work

54
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and provide us with uh these amazing fossil records.

55
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.199
But, uh, I mean, when it comes to the

56
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.330
oldest biomolecules we found uh preserved, we're talking about

57
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.350
at best units of millions of years. Right. That's

58
00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.040
what we're talking about here

59
00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:22.498
for, for DNA. And protein is relatively young. But

60
00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:29.309
there are other um biomolecules, for example, a chemical,

61
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.010
uh broad category of chemicals called porphyrins. One of

62
00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:38.559
which is heme, the molecule in uh hemoglobin that,

63
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.010
that binds and releases oxygen, that is a very

64
00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:50.410
important biomolecule. And it is uh potentially um you

65
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.350
know, hundreds of millions of years old. And in

66
00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.769
fact, uh the uh the people who are exploring

67
00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.170
Mars right now have instruments on the surface of

68
00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:03.910
MARS. And one of the things they will do

69
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.399
is to try to identify the molecule uh the

70
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.309
porphyrin molecule. And so some biomolecules uh can in

71
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.799
theory, perhaps be as much as a billion years

72
00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.820
old. Mhm.

73
00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:23.489
And to what extent would it be possible for

74
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.510
us to get a better understanding of the origins

75
00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:31.079
of life on earth by studying some of these

76
00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.799
preserved biomolecules.

77
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.519
That's uh uh uh AAA difficult um project because

78
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:49.140
life originated billions of years ago. Uh There, there

79
00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:55.359
is one very interesting aspect of, of ancient biomolecules

80
00:05:55.369 --> 00:06:01.570
which involves something called ancient sequence reconstruction where we

81
00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:06.640
use computers, artificial intelligence. If you will to try

82
00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.910
to predict what the sequence of DNA and proteins

83
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.230
were hundreds of millions, perhaps even billions of years

84
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:22.609
ago. In one study actually um came up with

85
00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:29.869
evidence that supported the origin of life at mid

86
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.790
oceanic ridges where we have these structures called black

87
00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:38.190
smokers where very hot water is being released from

88
00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:42.190
uh the uh inner portions of the earth. And

89
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.769
because of the warm temperatures uh there and because

90
00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:52.059
of all the nutrients that accumulate around those sites,

91
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.799
there's al always been a theory that that in

92
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:58.850
fact is where life originated. It did not originate

93
00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.890
on land, but rather at the mid oceanic ridges

94
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.880
and, and laboratories have used this technique of ancient

95
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:16.380
ancestral reconstruction to show that um proteins that may

96
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.100
have existed at those sites functioned at very high

97
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.859
temperatures unlike the proteins we have today.

98
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:31.220
And so, one of the illustrative examples you explore

99
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.579
in your book about how uh biomolecules get preserved

100
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.649
and some of the fossils associated with them. And

101
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.980
then of course, the information you can gather by

102
00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:47.200
studying these biomolecules is the fossil of a blood

103
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.420
enlarged mosquito. So, could you tell us a little

104
00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:53.200
bit about the story behind that fossil?

105
00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:00.299
We're all familiar with blood and gorge mosquitoes, right?

106
00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:04.260
We uh have watched them as they feel full

107
00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:06.869
of blood uh on our arm or our hand,

108
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.540
they're very, very delicate, delicate and uh one would

109
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:15.309
never expect that such an organism would be preserved.

110
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.420
But um the uh conditions under which the, the

111
00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:27.880
fossil insects were preserved at this site in Northwestern

112
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.530
Montana were very, very unique in that the uh

113
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.969
fossil insects uh were blown over or flew over

114
00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:41.849
the surface of a lake, but they didn't simply

115
00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:45.070
fall into the water and sink to the bottom

116
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.739
of the lake. What we think happened in, in

117
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.919
many cases, perhaps not all, but in many cases,

118
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.400
the surface of the water at that period of

119
00:08:55.409 --> 00:09:00.270
time was covered with a layer of cyanobacteria. Uh

120
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.710
AN algal mat, some people call it green slime

121
00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:08.750
and this material is very sticky. And so when

122
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.609
a tiny insect would fall onto it, the insect

123
00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:18.049
would be trapped and the algae or the cyanobacteria

124
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:22.609
is uh photosynthetic. And so it grows towards the

125
00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:26.909
sun and as it continues to grow, it would

126
00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:32.000
surround and envelop the tiny insect and it would

127
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.640
protect it uh from many of the things that

128
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.320
might otherwise destroy the insect. And once uh the

129
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.570
temperature is cooled a little bit, that layer of

130
00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:48.510
algae would sink to the bottom of the lake

131
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:56.840
with the entombed insect and would continue to protect

132
00:09:56.849 --> 00:10:01.640
it. It it was very unique preservation conditions. And

133
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.500
so, um it in fact was able to preserve

134
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.349
uh these blood and gorge mosquitoes. And it, in

135
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:13.820
fact is the only place in the world where

136
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.549
uh we have fossils of, of blood and gorge

137
00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:21.760
mosquitoes. When I first saw this fossil, the first

138
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.119
thing that came to mind was this in uh

139
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.429
enlarged and very dark abdomen? And I thought to

140
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:37.140
myself, wow, might that be blood? And uh of

141
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.770
course, thinking that it might be blood is very

142
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.840
different than proving that it is blood. And uh

143
00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:49.229
we were very lucky in being able to uh

144
00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:52.729
be able to use modern technology to in fact

145
00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:57.119
prove that that fossil mosquito which was 46 million

146
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:03.380
years old contained uh uh remnants of uh hemoglobin.

147
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.719
A. And so for the audience to get, let's

148
00:11:08.729 --> 00:11:12.510
say, a better understanding of how you go about

149
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.359
studying these biomolecules. Could you tell us a little

150
00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:20.260
bit more about the sort of techniques that you

151
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.905
and your colleagues used in the particular case of

152
00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:26.405
the mosquito fossil? But we can also talk a

153
00:11:26.414 --> 00:11:28.804
little bit about that when it comes to other

154
00:11:28.835 --> 00:11:34.375
kinds of biomolecules and particularly when you studied the

155
00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:37.184
he molecule in this case,

156
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.119
yes, the technology is very important. Uh One of

157
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:50.520
the things that paleobiologist dislike are techniques that require

158
00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.349
the destruction of the fossil in order to analyze

159
00:11:54.359 --> 00:12:00.000
it, right. And so we had two techniques available

160
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.119
to us. Uh The first was called energy dispersive

161
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:10.919
spectroscopy or E DS. And we use that to

162
00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:14.919
demonstrate that there were very high levels of the

163
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:20.659
metal iron in the abdomen of the mosquito. It

164
00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:23.320
was absent from other parts of the mosquito or

165
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:28.929
the surrounding rock. And, and the heme molecule contains

166
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.609
iron at its center and in fact, it's the

167
00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:36.989
iron molecule that attaches to and releases oxygen. And

168
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.289
so it's an integral part of the heme molecule.

169
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.330
So knowing that there were large amounts of iron

170
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.150
there, we suspected that the heat molecule might also

171
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:54.130
be there. And so we use a technique called

172
00:12:54.140 --> 00:13:00.669
uh um secondary secondary ion mass spectrometry, which is

173
00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:05.309
non destructive. Uh It doesn't harm the fossil, but

174
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:13.030
it um breaks uh tiny molecules into fragments and

175
00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:18.380
creates fingerprint patterns of, of fragments that we can

176
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.400
use to definitively identify the presence of small molecules.

177
00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:28.309
So those two techniques, both of them non destructive

178
00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:32.289
uh showed us that uh in fact, uh the

179
00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:34.590
porphyrin molecule, he was still there.

180
00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:42.280
And so uh another kind of uh molecules uh

181
00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:45.559
that you talk about in the book uh are

182
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:50.000
related to ancient pigments. So, could you tell us

183
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.479
how ancient pigments are studied and by studying them,

184
00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:59.880
what can we learn about a particular species?

185
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.419
I think pigments probably are the most common of

186
00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:10.619
all ancient biomolecules that extend really into deep time,

187
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.840
hundreds of millions of years old. Yeah. Um They

188
00:14:14.849 --> 00:14:19.380
uh you have to be a a serious uh

189
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.809
organic chemist in order to study them because you

190
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:28.450
use um you know, very high tech instrumentation like

191
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:34.859
infrared spectroscopy um and, and, and other techniques. But

192
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:41.119
um if you have a specimen that uh is

193
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.849
large enough and it is a destructive technology because

194
00:14:46.859 --> 00:14:49.260
you have to scrape off a bit of the

195
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.280
uh molecule. In order to isolate the pigment. Uh

196
00:14:53.289 --> 00:15:02.250
USING this these techniques, you can um um determine

197
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.200
the the the exact structure, the organic structure of

198
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.750
of these pigments. Some pigments, however, frustratingly are difficult

199
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.619
to analyze. For example, probably the most common pigment

200
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.219
that we think about, especially when we think about

201
00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:22.799
what color the feathers of of T rex were

202
00:15:23.309 --> 00:15:28.349
um is melanin and of course, melanin is, is

203
00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:33.489
responsible for all kinds of different uh pigmentation in

204
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.130
many different animals, but melanin, despite the fact that

205
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.739
it's very common, it is very difficult to identify.

206
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.359
It comes in a variety of structures and those

207
00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:57.250
structures are really exceedingly large. And um in fact,

208
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.799
a number of papers have been published where uh

209
00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:06.929
scientists attempt to uh identify melanin. But in fact,

210
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.760
uh using, for example, mass spectrometry, they can only

211
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:17.539
say that their data is suggestive of the presence.

212
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.349
Um So what scientists have turned to is a

213
00:16:22.359 --> 00:16:30.020
proxy, they are unable to identify the pigment itself.

214
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:35.809
And so they have used the shape and size

215
00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:40.510
of the tiny Granules that store melanin as a

216
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.760
proxy. If a uh if one of the storage

217
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.830
Granules is long and thin, as opposed to oval,

218
00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:54.489
they assign colors to it. And uh it's a

219
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.929
bit controversial. Um We're still not sure if that

220
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.140
is entirely accurate. A lot of pictures have been

221
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.858
published of beautiful dinosaurs with green and orange and

222
00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:15.160
red feathers but right now, um those are colors

223
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.520
that we think might have occurred. We, we don't

224
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.060
have any definitive proof yet

225
00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:26.167
and we are also not sure about the degree

226
00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:29.838
of certainty we have when it comes to the

227
00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:33.989
color of their feathers and skin. Right? I mean,

228
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:37.869
in the particular case of dinosaurs, people, people generally

229
00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:40.389
seem to be very fascinated by them and we

230
00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:44.149
see all of those depictions of dinosaurs with those

231
00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:48.609
bright colors. But we are not sure that they

232
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:52.249
really add those sorts of colors that we see,

233
00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:56.060
right? That is absolutely correct. It is a very

234
00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:59.619
dino centric world that we live in. Everyone wants

235
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.040
to know what the the dinosaurs look like and

236
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.400
perhaps at some point in the future, we will.

237
00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:10.589
Mhm But when it comes to studying ancient pigments

238
00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:16.160
and uh perhaps gathering more information about particular ex

239
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.790
uh species that already went extinct? Uh Is it

240
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.670
possible for us to perhaps learn a little bit

241
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.069
more about what would have been their behavior through

242
00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:29.150
color patterns? For example.

243
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.010
Yeah. Thank you Ricardo for, for, for asking that

244
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:41.790
question because the whole reason we study ancient molecules

245
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.369
is to try to learn not just about their

246
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.900
evolution, that is the evolution of the organisms and

247
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:56.160
their phylogeny, but things like behavior and physiology. Uh

248
00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.760
IT'S very difficult to study these phenomena from uh

249
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:09.479
simple rock structures. So for example, um um clinoids

250
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.060
that lived in the ocean, hundreds of millions of

251
00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:17.680
years ago, like today's relatives of crinoids are often

252
00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:22.609
brightly colored, bright red. And, um, we have been

253
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:26.839
able to show that, uh, these crinoids were in

254
00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:30.719
fact pigmented hundreds of millions of years ago and

255
00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:34.969
they probably served the same function that they serve

256
00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:39.290
today. And that is that many crinoids contain a

257
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:46.670
poisonous molecule. And, um, which in some cases is

258
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.469
the pigment itself, but the pigment also serves as

259
00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:55.209
a warning sign and tells potential predators to stay

260
00:19:55.219 --> 00:20:00.040
away, you know, don't eat me, I'm poisonous. And

261
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.819
um it is that type of behavior that we

262
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:08.410
could never be able to learn about if we

263
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.469
were simply looking at the structure of the, of

264
00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:19.349
the organism. And a wonderful example of um learning

265
00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:25.079
about the physiology of an organism through study of

266
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:31.020
its pigments. Although in this case, uh the pigment

267
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:36.180
is not something that um uh is displayed on

268
00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:38.060
in, in, in the uh the skin of the

269
00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:42.420
organism. The, the porphyrins, the he molecule are also

270
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:49.140
color, they are pigments. Uh THE green color of,

271
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.729
of leaves is due to chlorophyll. Uh uh AND

272
00:20:54.739 --> 00:20:59.260
and the uh porphyrin molecule inside of, of uh

273
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.959
of chlorophyll. And uh it's a pigment, it's green.

274
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.260
So blood is red, it's a pigment. And um

275
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:14.130
scientists were able to actually isolate purified. Actually, they

276
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:19.310
were able to synthesize pure, pure hemoglobin from mammoth,

277
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.170
40,000 year old mammoth. And they were able to

278
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.170
show that the hemoglobin in the mammoth 40,000 years

279
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.599
ago, functioned very differently from the way it functions

280
00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:38.609
today. It um is more able to release its

281
00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:44.040
oxygen at cold temperatures. And by so doing it,

282
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.010
it keeps the peripheral uh uh structures of the

283
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:53.209
mammoth warm, which it had to do back 40,000

284
00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:55.660
years ago when uh everything was in the middle

285
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.400
of the ice ages. Whereas today's, for example, the

286
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:05.550
Asian or African elephant, um the hemoglobin doesn't like

287
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.609
cold temperatures and refuses to release its oxygen at

288
00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:12.319
cold temperatures. So we, we have been able to,

289
00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:19.400
to identify the biochemical basis for some physiology of

290
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.530
some albeit shallow time uh fossils, the the mammoth

291
00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:30.609
and uh still on the topic of pigmentation in

292
00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:34.459
what ways can it be related to a mechanism

293
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:36.660
like sexual selection?

294
00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:44.479
Um I'm glad you asked that question because in

295
00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:48.060
fact, uh II I, I'm in the process of

296
00:22:48.069 --> 00:22:54.050
doing some, some interesting um research on some, this

297
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.209
is not in the book Ricardo, this is new

298
00:22:56.219 --> 00:23:03.390
work um on something called female sexual display. And

299
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.650
I think we all know it's I I in

300
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.140
in, in the natural world, it's almost always the

301
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:16.849
males that have sexual displays. Um YOU know, the

302
00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:20.130
the bright colors and and and the strutting around,

303
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.880
you know, that kind of thing. And so the

304
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:28.329
the existence of female sexual display is very interesting

305
00:23:28.339 --> 00:23:34.540
to behaviorists, scientists who study behavior, right? And in

306
00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:39.310
this particular case, we have um a type of

307
00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:46.339
fly where the, the females have enlarged and very

308
00:23:46.349 --> 00:23:53.930
darkly pigmented wings, which um, attracts the males, which

309
00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:57.099
is very important because the females do not feed.

310
00:23:57.109 --> 00:24:01.180
The only nutrition they get is when the male

311
00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:05.569
brings them, uh, some prey to feed on. And

312
00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:08.959
while the female feeds on that prey, the, the,

313
00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:13.170
the male mates with the female fly. And so

314
00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:19.170
here's a case where uh uh we have in,

315
00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.239
in this work that I'm doing now, the first

316
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:29.510
example, um uh in the fossil record of female

317
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.560
sexual display. And it's based totally on the presence

318
00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:39.010
of pigments in the wings of those female flies.

319
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.560
So here we can, we can trace perhaps the

320
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:48.540
evolution of that behavior as well as the presence

321
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:53.550
of that uh um display behavior in, in the

322
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.359
fossil record. Does that, does that come close to

323
00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:59.150
answering your, your question?

324
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.569
Mhm Yes, it does. And I have just one

325
00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:05.619
more question about pigments before we move on to

326
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.800
other biomolecules that you also explore in the book.

327
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.060
So, uh can we study the evolution of color

328
00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:15.739
vision through pigmentation?

329
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.959
Uh That's an interesting question. And given that um

330
00:25:23.969 --> 00:25:28.800
color vision is thought to have evolved hundreds of

331
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:34.250
millions of years ago. It is um it, it's

332
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:40.040
difficult. Um What we can do is simply make

333
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:46.420
the assumption that if there were colors hundreds of

334
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.780
millions of years ago, there must have been color

335
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:55.619
vision, right? One way that we can try to

336
00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:01.160
estimate the age of color vision is by use,

337
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:07.060
excuse me, of, of something called the molecular clock,

338
00:26:07.209 --> 00:26:11.329
which was in invented by a very famous chemist

339
00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:16.520
polling uh you know, 60 years ago. And that

340
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:21.510
is we can study the sequence of different species

341
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.510
of organisms and we can use that protein sequence

342
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:33.670
to predict how those proteins changed back in time.

343
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.969
And we can go hundreds of millions of years

344
00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:42.430
back in time. And we can make predictions of

345
00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:47.819
when the molecules that are responsible for color visions,

346
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.780
they're called options. We can make predictions about when

347
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.319
they first occurred. Uh So on that level, the

348
00:26:57.329 --> 00:26:59.900
answer to your question is, is, is yes, we

349
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.420
can make predictions about the evolution of color vision.

350
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:08.500
But in terms of using the actual fossil pigments,

351
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.760
uh we have not made it there yet.

352
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.000
And so now I would like to move on

353
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.640
to bio meals. And I have two big questions

354
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.359
about the that kind of mole biomolecule. So first

355
00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:26.760
of all, what is the importance of biomet for

356
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.359
life itself? What kind of roles do they play?

357
00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:36.780
I I think it's important that we all understand

358
00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:42.060
that uh metals uh those that are present in

359
00:27:42.069 --> 00:27:45.819
life forms, that is the biomeds are essential for

360
00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:50.140
life without them. There would be no life and

361
00:27:50.349 --> 00:27:58.040
um metals can occur in elemental form that is

362
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.800
a, a big nodule of pure iron or, or

363
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.920
pure copper, but usually they occur as metal salts.

364
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.750
So for example, um bone is uh has calcium,

365
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.790
which of course is a metal, but it's not

366
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.290
elemental metal. It is a metal salt, uh calcium

367
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:28.319
carbonate, calcium appetite. And in fact, most metals in

368
00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:34.089
living organisms are salts of those metals. Um In

369
00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:37.790
some cases, we're not sure exactly what the structure

370
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.969
of the metals were in some organisms. Uh For

371
00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:47.030
example, uh in the book, we talk about the

372
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.410
discovery of ancient metals that strengthen and reinforce the

373
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:59.050
jaws of, of insects and even the insects that

374
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.579
live today, which still reinforce their jaws with metals.

375
00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:05.930
We still don't know what the structure of those

376
00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:11.020
metals is in those organisms. There's there's much yet

377
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.770
to be to be learned. Um And because metals

378
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.260
can be detected fairly easily and at very low

379
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:26.410
levels and in non destructive uh ways, um biomeds

380
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.589
is becoming a very important part of ancient biomolecule

381
00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:33.430
research. And I think we're gonna see more and

382
00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:36.880
more papers um about it.

383
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.099
And so, of course, uh again, I have to

384
00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:44.390
repeat this kind of question for biomet because I

385
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.660
think it's one of the most interesting parts of

386
00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:50.069
what you explore in the book when it comes

387
00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:54.239
to the different biomolecules. But what kinds of information

388
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.869
can we get from them? So for example, when

389
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.219
we talked about pigmentation, we've mentioned phylogenetic information, behavioral

390
00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:05.979
information as well. In this case of biomedicals, I

391
00:30:05.989 --> 00:30:10.979
would imagine that physiological information is a very evident

392
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.180
uh sort of thing that we can get from

393
00:30:13.189 --> 00:30:17.420
them. So, but generally speaking, what can we learn

394
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.689
by studying ancient biomeds?

395
00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:34.010
I would have to um preface any answer with

396
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.680
the observation that we really need to know more

397
00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:45.290
about biomeds in living organisms. OK. Um Before we

398
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.239
can go on to uh ask intelligent questions about

399
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:55.729
ancient organisms, the science is very new and uh

400
00:30:55.739 --> 00:30:59.569
very little work has been done actually on, on

401
00:30:59.579 --> 00:31:04.260
uh ancient biomeds. Other than for example, he and

402
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:12.819
um um other porphyrin metals um laboratories are investigating

403
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:19.689
uh the structure of biomeds in living organisms. And

404
00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:23.290
they're discovering that mother nature is much more complicated

405
00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.459
than we ever thought it was and produces structures

406
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.099
that we have uh as scientists have, have never

407
00:31:31.109 --> 00:31:34.459
even dreamed about. So there's a lot to learn

408
00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:39.099
about biomeds and I think we have to uh

409
00:31:39.109 --> 00:31:42.959
do more work on, on living organisms before we

410
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:46.459
can uh uh answer your question, Ricardo.

411
00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:50.180
OK. So, I mean, when it comes to the

412
00:31:50.189 --> 00:31:55.609
several different possible things we could learn from biomedicals

413
00:31:55.619 --> 00:32:01.589
like for example, phylogenetic information, anatomical information, physiological, information,

414
00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:05.550
behavioral, and so on. It's still very limited at

415
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.630
this point, at least.

416
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.160
Yes. Uh I'm not sure to what degree we

417
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.810
can learn very much about phylogeny, but we can

418
00:32:14.819 --> 00:32:21.290
definitely learn a lot about uh the physiology of,

419
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.239
of, of organisms based on the study of biomeds.

420
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.479
Mhm.

421
00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:30.150
And so let's talk a little bit about proteins.

422
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.969
Here. So what kinds of proteins get preserved in

423
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:41.819
fossils? That's a great question. Um The um paper

424
00:32:41.829 --> 00:32:47.040
that just came out by a uh a scientist

425
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.400
from the University of Turin in, in Italy. Uh

426
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.439
De Marchi was the senior author of this paper

427
00:32:54.959 --> 00:33:01.030
uh extends uh the age of ancient biomolecules to

428
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.920
uh over 6 million years. And the sequence they

429
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:14.689
found had a very unique sequence of four negatively

430
00:33:14.699 --> 00:33:24.079
charged subunits. And um that protein was isolated from

431
00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:31.900
the shell of a bird. Almost all proteins are

432
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:38.599
isolated are isolated either from bones, from teeth, from

433
00:33:38.609 --> 00:33:45.280
egg shells or from the shells of uh snails

434
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:57.189
and gastropods. And um all of those environment have

435
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:03.500
a calcium carbonate or calcium appetite, which is positively

436
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:08.399
charged or has positive charges. And so proteins that

437
00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:12.909
are negative, that can bind to the positive charges

438
00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:15.750
in the bone, the teeth, the shells are those

439
00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.049
that are most likely to be preserved. And um

440
00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:26.649
now that's for deep time, fossils for shallow time

441
00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:31.909
and let's define shallow time as something like around

442
00:34:31.918 --> 00:34:37.370
uh maybe several million years old. Um uh WE

443
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:41.458
can get uh more proteins and different types of

444
00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:45.489
proteins simply because they are young and haven't degraded

445
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:51.079
yet. And so our studies, for example of um

446
00:34:51.128 --> 00:34:55.998
uh the ancestors of human, which rely on um

447
00:34:56.009 --> 00:35:01.599
fossil skeletons, uh we can get entire proteome. And

448
00:35:01.608 --> 00:35:04.438
by the di the definition of a proteome, of

449
00:35:04.448 --> 00:35:08.239
course, is the sequences of every protein in an

450
00:35:08.249 --> 00:35:12.799
organism. And so what we can learn from those

451
00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:18.330
is, is almost limitless. And um so the answer

452
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.689
to your question, Ricardo uh very much depends on

453
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:28.000
how old the specimen is. Um I think one

454
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:34.909
of the uh directions where ancient uh biomolecule research

455
00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:39.520
will expand is in the area of um uh

456
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:48.000
marine mollusc shells, uh shells of gastropods and clams

457
00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.459
go back hundreds of millions of years. Most of

458
00:35:51.469 --> 00:35:54.560
them have been replaced. The, the shell material has

459
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.260
been replaced with other type of rock. But in

460
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.120
many cases, they're still the same chemicals that, that

461
00:36:01.129 --> 00:36:04.840
made up the original shell of the living organism.

462
00:36:04.989 --> 00:36:08.969
And those shells contain proteins and we just have

463
00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:11.610
to be able to work with them more. And

464
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.949
I think what we will find uh are, are

465
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.560
we're gonna find thousands of new sequences from, from

466
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.590
that source.

467
00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.719
And OK, so let me ask you perhaps a

468
00:36:24.729 --> 00:36:28.000
few more questions about proteins because I think that

469
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.929
there are many interesting things here that we could

470
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:34.590
explore. But to what extent can we learn more

471
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.520
about if the physiology of particular organisms by studying

472
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.919
these preserved proteins? And, and I know that this

473
00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:48.459
is a very broad question because proteins are everywhere.

474
00:36:48.469 --> 00:36:51.330
I mean, they play all sorts of different roles

475
00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.530
and there's, I don't know how many proteins out

476
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.550
there in uh in biological, in organisms. Uh I

477
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.080
mean, they're everywhere basically. But uh ca can we

478
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:08.969
learn uh more about their physiology by studying these

479
00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:11.429
proteins. And perhaps, I don't know if you want

480
00:37:11.439 --> 00:37:14.959
to illustrate that with uh perhaps a few examples

481
00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:15.520
or not.

482
00:37:16.419 --> 00:37:20.320
Sure the answer to your question. Caro is a

483
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:25.399
uh yes with an exclamation point. Um And given

484
00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:31.439
that um most ancient proteins are isolated from uh

485
00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:36.199
shallow time fossils, those that are tens of thousands

486
00:37:36.209 --> 00:37:39.760
or hundreds of thousands of years old. And we

487
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:45.510
can get their entire protium, the sequence of every

488
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:52.689
protein in the organism. We can learn everything about

489
00:37:52.709 --> 00:38:01.389
their physiology. Um We can um determine, for example,

490
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:11.429
that uh um some ancient humans or neanderthals, um

491
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:19.669
we um had an allergy to milk. Hm. That's,

492
00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:25.100
that's one tiny example. Um Their immune system was

493
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:31.310
different. And in fact, uh uh all of us

494
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.780
contain a little bit of uh DNA and proteins

495
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:43.189
that we inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors, right? And

496
00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:48.780
some of those proteins um affect our immune system

497
00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:54.810
and some of us are in fact more susceptible

498
00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:03.409
to catching the COVID virus. Mhm. Because of the

499
00:39:03.419 --> 00:39:10.030
presence of Neanderthal proteins in our bodies. So, because

500
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.090
we can, we can, we can uh isolate the

501
00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:21.699
entire protium of, of uh many organisms of the

502
00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:24.620
answer to your question is that it's, it's, it's

503
00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:28.350
a gold mine of, of, of work that we

504
00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.899
can do relative to how the physiology of ancient

505
00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:38.600
humans and ancient organisms differed from from modern day

506
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:44.100
humans and, and uh and other animals. Um YOU

507
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:52.000
know, our studies of human evolution, homo sapiens migration

508
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.260
from Africa, our studies of the genetics of the

509
00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.750
neanderthals. We've learned so much about that and yet

510
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.489
we've just scratched the surface. Uh THE future is

511
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.939
going to be very, very exciting um relative to

512
00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:13.840
our understanding of, of human evolution because of what

513
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.770
we can learn about um or from proteins, about

514
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.010
our behavior and, and physiology.

515
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.580
And can we learn more about phylogenetics from ancient

516
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:31.870
proteins? And I mean, uh uh I, while I'm

517
00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:35.709
asking you this, I'm probably asking you two different

518
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:38.100
types of questions. I mean, if we can learn

519
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:44.780
about phylogenetics directly from ancient proteins or also indirectly

520
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:50.659
uh uh learning more about genetics from proteins.

521
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.620
The older the specimen is, the older the protein

522
00:40:56.629 --> 00:41:00.719
is, the more we can learn, it's all dependent

523
00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:05.510
on how far back we can isolate uh proteins

524
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:12.469
and, and DNA from um the construction of phylogeny

525
00:41:12.479 --> 00:41:21.419
and phylogenetics is, is um something that is um

526
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:27.800
dependent. Mhm um um um HAVING a lot of

527
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.840
specimens from a lot of different periods of time,

528
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.350
right? And the further back in time, the more

529
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.189
phylogenetics we can do. Um AND and right now,

530
00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:45.620
we're kind of limited by uh the fact that

531
00:41:45.629 --> 00:41:50.639
uh um ancient DNA and ancient ancient proteins don't

532
00:41:50.649 --> 00:41:54.800
go very far back in time. And this and

533
00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:58.199
this might be uh an appropriate time to bring

534
00:41:58.209 --> 00:42:02.600
up the work of Dr Mary Schweitzer who has

535
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:07.050
uh uh published about the sequences from uh dinosaurs

536
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.350
that are hundreds of millions of years old or,

537
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.159
or hundreds of million years old. This work is,

538
00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:18.949
is very controversial. Um uh HER work um is

539
00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:22.280
uh can't be reproduced by some of the laboratories.

540
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.620
Yeah. And so I think the consensus is that

541
00:42:25.629 --> 00:42:29.560
the oldest DNA is only about 2 million years

542
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.020
old. The oldest proteins are about 4 million years

543
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.929
old. Now, 6 million years old with the work

544
00:42:35.939 --> 00:42:40.409
from Italy, I think we all hope the doctors

545
00:42:40.419 --> 00:42:44.409
Switzer is correct. And that in fact, we can

546
00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:50.389
isolate proteins from dinosaurs because it would be wonderful

547
00:42:50.399 --> 00:42:55.520
to be able to do uh phylogenetics, reconstruct the

548
00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:00.320
phylogeny of dinosaurs and compare that work to the

549
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.989
phylogeny we have made that are based simply on,

550
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.929
on structure. Mhm

551
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.229
uh And so just before we get directly into

552
00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:16.050
ancient DNA, since you mentioned dinosaurs there briefly again.

553
00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:18.919
So uh one interesting thing that I read about

554
00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:22.659
in your book is uh when we find dinosaur

555
00:43:22.669 --> 00:43:27.399
bones, sometimes it's not just the bones themselves that

556
00:43:27.409 --> 00:43:32.439
we can study, but also ancient blood vessels within

557
00:43:32.449 --> 00:43:34.699
them, right? So could, could you tell us a

558
00:43:34.709 --> 00:43:35.810
little bit about that?

559
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.780
Yes, that, that is the work uh of, of

560
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:45.090
Doctor Schweitzer. And she's very famous for uh showing

561
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.280
all of us that you can take a dinosaur

562
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:51.219
bone. And when you dissolve all the minerals you

563
00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:56.669
are left over with this uh soft tissue, it

564
00:43:56.679 --> 00:44:00.040
almost looks like uh a tiny little piece of,

565
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:05.669
of, of, of meat. And uh within that material,

566
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.510
you can isolate structures that very much look like

567
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:16.929
blood vessels. OK. And um this work uh has

568
00:44:16.939 --> 00:44:21.300
been repeated by many, many different laboratories. Um I

569
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.139
have been able to repeat this work myself in

570
00:44:24.149 --> 00:44:31.530
the lab. And um the, the, the problem is

571
00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:35.350
what is that material made of? And if in

572
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.879
fact, it is made of, of protein and DNA

573
00:44:39.889 --> 00:44:44.209
can we isolate it intact. And that is the

574
00:44:44.219 --> 00:44:48.169
big controversy. Some people say no, some people say

575
00:44:48.179 --> 00:44:48.570
yes.

576
00:44:50.949 --> 00:44:56.860
So talking then about ancient DNA, how well does

577
00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:01.290
it get preserved? And in what kinds of structures

578
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.370
again, uh almost all ancient DNA comes from bones

579
00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:14.239
or teeth. Mhm. Um There is something called environmental

580
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.989
DNA. OK, where people would just take a shovel

581
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.459
full of dirt from the bottom of a cave

582
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.729
and they can isolate DNA, which is very surprising

583
00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:30.199
given given how, how fragile a molecule it is.

584
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.290
But most ancient DNA is isolated from, from bones

585
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:43.379
and teeth. And um in some cases, if the

586
00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:46.419
uh specimen is young enough, we can get the

587
00:45:46.429 --> 00:45:51.699
entire genome. Uh THE genome being all of the

588
00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:59.229
uh DNA from a particular organism. And uh again,

589
00:45:59.239 --> 00:46:03.070
I if we have that kind of information, um

590
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:10.090
we can determine a great deal of, of, of

591
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.739
uh things about the behavior physiology, phylogeny of that

592
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:20.610
organism. It all depends on, on its age. Um

593
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:28.659
THE um oldest DNA, I think is about 2

594
00:46:28.669 --> 00:46:33.350
million years old and it's only fragmentary and it's

595
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.590
uh it's uh fairly difficult to do uh any

596
00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.870
uh in depth uh work on phylogenetics with something

597
00:46:41.879 --> 00:46:45.310
that is that fragmentary. Um I'm not sure I

598
00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.479
answered your question, Ricardo. Uh Please restate the question

599
00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:49.649
if, if, if I didn't

600
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.080
uh yes. One part of the question that perhaps

601
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:57.959
uh you didn't answer directly, I think is how

602
00:46:57.969 --> 00:47:01.739
well it gets uh preserved. I mean, is it

603
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:05.520
easy for it to get preserved in ancient DNA

604
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.239
or not?

605
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.379
Yeah. So, uh uh again, it's dependent on the

606
00:47:12.389 --> 00:47:16.489
age of the specimen and the younger the age,

607
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:23.120
um it can be preserved entirely intact, beautifully preserved

608
00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:29.060
and, and the older we go, the less uh

609
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:33.179
uh there is and the more fragmentary it is.

610
00:47:33.189 --> 00:47:37.520
So, everything depends on age. I think ancient DNA,

611
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:44.080
depending on how we define ancient, has drastically changed.

612
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:50.479
Uh THE sciences of anthropology and archaeology because those,

613
00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:54.989
those two sciences work in the realm of, of

614
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.139
um shallow time specimens that are 1000 years old

615
00:48:00.149 --> 00:48:06.929
or 5000, 10,000, 100,000 years old. And DNA uh

616
00:48:06.939 --> 00:48:15.209
is beautifully preserved uh under many conditions um in

617
00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:18.439
specimens that are just uh you know, tens of

618
00:48:18.449 --> 00:48:22.090
thousands of years old. And, and, and uh i

619
00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:26.830
it's a near infinite amount of information that we

620
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.199
can obtain from uh from those specimens. But, but

621
00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:34.580
again, that's not in the field of, of paleobiology.

622
00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.399
That's more anthropology and, and uh and archaeology. A

623
00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:45.219
good example is our understanding of the evolution of

624
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.590
the um uh the Black death or the um

625
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:58.399
um bubonic plague which first appeared in the early

626
00:48:58.409 --> 00:49:03.409
13 hundreds. And we were able to isolate DNA

627
00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:07.540
from uh people who, who the skeletons of people

628
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.649
who died from the Black death. And we were

629
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:16.070
able to uh study the uh evolution of that

630
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:22.459
virus and even determine when in fact, uh it

631
00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:28.969
underwent a mutation to become uh terribly pathogenic. So,

632
00:49:28.979 --> 00:49:33.120
yeah, it's a the the the future of of

633
00:49:33.129 --> 00:49:39.520
shallow time DNA is uh um you know, it's

634
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.780
gonna be very exciting to see what, what happens

635
00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.639
here in the future.

636
00:49:43.699 --> 00:49:47.719
So if I understand it correctly, the amount of

637
00:49:47.729 --> 00:49:52.479
information that we can potentially get from ancient DNA

638
00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:57.330
is so much and so varied, that's probably one

639
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.050
of the reasons why many people usually refer to

640
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:06.750
ancient DNA as the holy grail of ancient biomolecules,

641
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.889
right. Yeah.

642
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:15.800
Yeah. Um DNA, of course, um encodes proteins and

643
00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:19.669
so much of the genetic information from DNA is

644
00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:22.870
present in proteins, but there is a lot of

645
00:50:22.879 --> 00:50:28.290
genetic information that is in DNA only. Um And

646
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:32.659
it is uh I think uh easier to do

647
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:38.429
phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA than it is uh protein.

648
00:50:38.899 --> 00:50:44.510
So, there are distinct advantages to using DNA. Um

649
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.260
We just have to figure out how to uh

650
00:50:47.939 --> 00:50:51.689
uh extract it more effectively and, and more efficiently

651
00:50:51.699 --> 00:50:53.260
from older specimens.

652
00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:57.969
And at this point in time, do we have

653
00:50:57.979 --> 00:51:02.629
any idea at all about when DNA might have

654
00:51:02.639 --> 00:51:05.729
first originated on earth? At least?

655
00:51:08.919 --> 00:51:14.649
No, that, uh it's a sh a short question

656
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.479
or a short answer to a very complicated question.

657
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:24.590
Um People think it may, uh, well, in fact,

658
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:30.620
we have fossils of single celled organisms that are

659
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:35.050
over a billion years old. Billion with A B.

660
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.909
And so we know there was life on earth

661
00:51:38.639 --> 00:51:43.030
that is a, a billion, perhaps 2 billion years

662
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.669
old. And we have to assume that because life

663
00:51:49.679 --> 00:51:53.729
was able to reproduce even back then, that there

664
00:51:53.739 --> 00:52:01.229
is a uh DNA based mechanism for reproduction. Uh

665
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.919
So we have to assume that DNA evolved at

666
00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:12.590
least 2 billion years ago, probably longer. Um But

667
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.120
we don't know how and we don't know exactly

668
00:52:16.129 --> 00:52:21.199
when there are some, a scientist who believed that

669
00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:26.729
it was not DNA, that was the basis of

670
00:52:26.739 --> 00:52:30.750
original life forms, but in fact RN A, right.

671
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.729
Uh But again, there, there's no way to uh

672
00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:37.500
no way to prove that RN A is, in

673
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:42.959
fact, even more fragile than, than DNA. And it's

674
00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:45.580
very unlikely that we will ever be able to

675
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:48.560
recover ancient RN A.

676
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.510
Uh So at least at this point in time,

677
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.939
it's not possible to get RN A from fossils,

678
00:52:58.689 --> 00:53:01.250
right? Oh, ok.

679
00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:04.560
Uh And uh I mean, before we get into

680
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.340
other topics, let me just ask you one more

681
00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:12.020
question. Um How much can we learn about the

682
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:18.129
ancestry of our own species through ancient DNA? Because,

683
00:53:18.139 --> 00:53:21.709
you know, there's always this sort of very interesting

684
00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:25.129
questions or questions that people are usually very interested

685
00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:29.774
about particularly paleoanthropology and people like that about, for

686
00:53:29.784 --> 00:53:34.985
example, our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and Bonobos

687
00:53:34.995 --> 00:53:40.364
and the, our exact monin lineage and all of

688
00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:44.135
that. So can we can ancient DNA help us

689
00:53:44.145 --> 00:53:46.094
answer those kinds of questions?

690
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.419
Yeah, I'm looking for uh a book up on

691
00:53:49.429 --> 00:53:55.229
my bookshelf here. Uh uh Robert Reich uh wrote

692
00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:58.800
a book about that. And in fact, many books

693
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:03.929
have been written uh about the uh phylogeny, the

694
00:54:03.939 --> 00:54:08.020
evolution of not just Homo sapiens but our ancestors

695
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:12.270
and not just our most recent ancestors, the Neanderthal,

696
00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:15.850
but the homo erectus and uh you know, way

697
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:19.889
back uh uh to uh over a million years

698
00:54:19.899 --> 00:54:28.739
old. Um The amount of information that we can

699
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:36.459
obtain from our studies of um ancient DNA, from

700
00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:42.989
the genus Homo. It is mind boggling. There is

701
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.360
so much we can learn. And again, it's not

702
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:52.830
just phylogenetics, it's behavioral, it's physiological. Um As I

703
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.870
mentioned, there are many books written about this already.

704
00:54:57.409 --> 00:55:00.389
Uh AND there will be many more, we've barely

705
00:55:00.399 --> 00:55:04.959
scratched the surface. Uh There are so many different

706
00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:11.719
questions. Um It is an area that um I

707
00:55:11.729 --> 00:55:15.719
did not cover to any great extent in the

708
00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:19.610
book because I am not an expert on, on,

709
00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:24.219
on DNA. And so uh I'm proud of the

710
00:55:24.229 --> 00:55:27.250
fact that I know what I don't know. And

711
00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:30.739
uh so II I leave it to, to other

712
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:35.649
experts uh to tell you about um the uh

713
00:55:35.659 --> 00:55:38.850
the work with ancient DNA. But uh it will

714
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:44.530
revolutionize science and it will revolutionize our understanding of,

715
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.679
of the evolution of, of our own species.

716
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:52.530
So, uh I mean, throughout the entire interview, we've

717
00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:57.090
been focusing a lot on animals. But what about

718
00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:00.949
plants, what have we learned about, for example, early

719
00:56:00.959 --> 00:56:05.389
plant life and the evolution of plants through an

720
00:56:05.399 --> 00:56:07.120
ancient biomolecules.

721
00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:15.689
Unfortunately, the answer is almost nothing and the reason

722
00:56:15.699 --> 00:56:21.540
uh that we have learned so little from plants

723
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:26.110
and II I, I'm not trying to be um

724
00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:31.750
uh facetious or, or comical here is that plants

725
00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:36.600
don't have bones and that's where we get all

726
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.989
of our ancient DNA and all of our ancient

727
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.010
protein plants are made of soft tissue, which is

728
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:50.899
very easily degraded. Uh There is almost nothing in

729
00:56:50.909 --> 00:56:56.800
the scientic scientific literature on plant DNA because it

730
00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:01.080
just degrades so very, very quickly. There is a

731
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:05.850
little bit about um uh plant protein, but it's

732
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:11.719
uh only a few 1000 years old. The most

733
00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:17.260
we know about ancient biomolecules from plants is based

734
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:24.129
on uh what we call small molecules. Uh And

735
00:57:24.139 --> 00:57:26.959
even that doesn't go very far back in time,

736
00:57:26.969 --> 00:57:31.739
let me define small molecules by giving some examples.

737
00:57:32.189 --> 00:57:40.429
Um We have all made extracts of plants usually

738
00:57:40.439 --> 00:57:46.979
using hot water uh that contain small molecules like

739
00:57:46.989 --> 00:57:51.629
uh caffeine, for example, from the coffee bean and

740
00:57:51.639 --> 00:57:56.489
from tea leaves, there are literally tens of thousands

741
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.070
of small molecules that are unique to plants. Uh

742
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.610
THINK of all the uh hallucis hallucinogenic uh drugs,

743
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:13.530
for example, um Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid is uh a

744
00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.449
small molecule that you can isolate from plants. All

745
00:58:17.459 --> 00:58:20.310
of these are unique to plants. They're not present

746
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:26.090
in animals and they can be preserved in, in

747
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:30.409
plants that go back uh many millions of years.

748
00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:34.520
And in fact, uh at one point in time,

749
00:58:35.139 --> 00:58:40.570
some scientists proposed that we study phylogenetics based on

750
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:46.639
the presence of those small molecules. So I guess

751
00:58:46.649 --> 00:58:50.280
the term phylogenetics wouldn't be the the appropriate term.

752
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.909
Um BUT it would be AAA way to study

753
00:58:55.919 --> 00:59:01.840
the evolution of plants based on their small molecules.

754
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.360
And um so you would take a fossil leaf

755
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:10.419
and you would scrape it off of a rock

756
00:59:10.639 --> 00:59:12.959
and you would extract it just like you would

757
00:59:12.969 --> 00:59:16.780
extract a tea leaf and from that extract, you

758
00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:20.500
would be able to isolate tiny molecules, some of

759
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:24.699
which may be unique to that particular plant. And

760
00:59:24.709 --> 00:59:29.850
so you could differentiate one plant from another. Uh

761
00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:35.590
You could actually do taxonomy based on the presence

762
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.850
of uh small molecules that are unique to individual

763
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:46.469
plants. That chemo taxonomy, let's call it that, let's

764
00:59:46.479 --> 00:59:50.370
give it that name chemo taxonomy. Uh NEVER caught

765
00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:54.100
on it, it is not really used at all

766
00:59:54.110 --> 01:00:00.110
in, in modern plant taxonomy, but um it does

767
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.719
uh exist simply because of the presence of um

768
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.110
these small molecules and plants for, for literally tens

769
01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.189
of millions of years.

770
01:00:12.989 --> 01:00:17.860
So I have two final general questions, let's say

771
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:23.050
to ask you. So, potentially how much of the

772
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:29.010
phylogeny and ancient physio of the total biomass of

773
01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.179
the earth? Can we or could we get a

774
01:00:32.189 --> 01:00:38.649
good understanding of through ancient genomes, proteins? And of

775
01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:41.360
course, other biomolecules,

776
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:48.830
we don't know. Um I think it's um uh

777
01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:55.050
most of us should appreciate that 90% of all

778
01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.070
the species of organisms that have ever lived on

779
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:04.290
earth are now extinct. And so that means that

780
01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:09.040
90% of everything we have to we have uh

781
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:14.629
to learn from is in the fossil record, right?

782
01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.649
And so potentially there's a huge amount we can

783
01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:24.310
learn. We're limited only by the uh preservation or

784
01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.070
the lack of preservation of the uh chemicals, whether

785
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.580
they're DNA or protein pigments or small molecules. I

786
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:43.000
think paleobiology will change over the next uh few

787
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:50.560
years. And uh uh they will take ancient biomolecules

788
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.879
research to heart and more young people, I think

789
01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:59.439
uh are becoming very interested in ancient biomolecule research

790
01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.010
and I think it will, it, it is a

791
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:06.669
new and, and rapidly growing field. Um, THERE'S a

792
01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:11.100
huge amount of potential. Um, BUT II, I certainly

793
01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:14.169
can't put a uh a number on it right

794
01:02:14.179 --> 01:02:17.320
now, Ricardo, I wish I could. But, uh, uh,

795
01:02:17.899 --> 01:02:22.399
again, we're, uh, um, despite the fact that we

796
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:26.159
might, um, publish a lot and think we know

797
01:02:26.169 --> 01:02:29.889
a lot. Uh, WE'RE, we're, we're pretty ignorant about

798
01:02:29.899 --> 01:02:31.489
the evolution of life on earth.

799
01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:35.439
That's fair enough. And, uh, that also makes for

800
01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:38.629
a good segue to my last question. And you've

801
01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:41.689
already talked a little bit about this. But how

802
01:02:41.699 --> 01:02:44.800
do you look at the future of the study

803
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.830
of ancient biomolecules and the information we can potentially

804
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.429
get from them? I mean, are there any predictions

805
01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:56.169
you would make? Are there for example, any exciting

806
01:02:56.179 --> 01:02:58.979
new developments that you're seeing?

807
01:03:01.179 --> 01:03:05.659
I think the the the most exciting development uh

808
01:03:05.669 --> 01:03:10.120
in the field of ancient biomolecular research has nothing

809
01:03:10.129 --> 01:03:15.639
to do with fossils. And that's because it is

810
01:03:15.649 --> 01:03:21.590
a science called ancient sequence reconstruction where we use

811
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:28.659
um computers to predict the sequence of ancient proteins

812
01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:35.209
or ancient DNA. Mhm. And this interestingly and perhaps

813
01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:42.540
surprisingly is most commonly used in uh drug discovery

814
01:03:43.129 --> 01:03:48.030
in uh by, by pharmaceutical companies because they want

815
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.510
to understand the evolution of disease. They want to

816
01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:01.229
understand the evolution of proteins that uh cause various

817
01:04:01.239 --> 01:04:07.510
diseases. And we can try to predict using this

818
01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.909
computer based uh science of ancient sequence construction, we

819
01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:19.929
can try to uh determine how proteins that cause

820
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:24.199
disease differed back in time and what happened to

821
01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:29.159
them to make them uh cause disease. And this

822
01:04:29.169 --> 01:04:32.560
will give us a basis for developing drugs that

823
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:35.330
will help us to, to treat those diseases. So,

824
01:04:35.419 --> 01:04:38.270
in a way here, we're talking about drug discovery

825
01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:41.159
and we're supposed to be talking about ancient proteins.

826
01:04:41.189 --> 01:04:42.889
But I think believe it or not, the two

827
01:04:42.899 --> 01:04:43.540
are related

828
01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:48.949
that that's amazing. Uh And so let's perhaps end

829
01:04:48.959 --> 01:04:51.949
on that note then. And the book is again,

830
01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:55.189
Remnants of Ancient life, the New Science of old

831
01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:57.870
fossils. I'm leaving a link to it in the

832
01:04:57.879 --> 01:05:00.870
description of the interview. And Doctor Greenwald just before

833
01:05:00.879 --> 01:05:04.129
we go apart from your book, would you like

834
01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:07.110
to tell people where they can find your work

835
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.110
on the internet?

836
01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.040
Yes. The, the, the book is published by uh

837
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:18.000
Princeton University Press and they can be purchased at

838
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.179
their website. And um one thing I would like

839
01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:26.379
to say is that uh all of uh my

840
01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:30.780
profits such as they are uh go directly to

841
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:35.639
the uh the Library of the Natural History Museum

842
01:05:35.649 --> 01:05:39.489
in uh at the Smithsonian. And so, uh if

843
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.899
anyone in fact does purchase a book, uh uh

844
01:05:42.909 --> 01:05:46.500
they will be able to in doing so contribute

845
01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:52.510
to the libraries. Um So, yeah, II, I wish

846
01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:00.810
um um that um I could uh uh sign

847
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.939
everyone's book uh based uh through the zoom session.

848
01:06:04.949 --> 01:06:08.060
But uh I guess that's not technically possible yet.

849
01:06:08.479 --> 01:06:12.250
But uh yeah, I, I uh I hope that

850
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.530
uh uh people would find that it is an

851
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:16.489
enjoyable read.

852
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:20.729
No, let me just say myself that I found

853
01:06:20.739 --> 01:06:24.439
it uh really fascinating read. I really love the

854
01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:27.360
book and I hope that everyone in my audience

855
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:31.429
runs and buys it. It's very interesting. So, thank

856
01:06:31.439 --> 01:06:33.729
you so much for writing the book. And also

857
01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:36.270
of course for coming on the show, it's been

858
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.770
a real pleasure to talk to you.

859
01:06:38.629 --> 01:06:41.770
Thank you, Ricardo. I, I appreciate the opportunity to

860
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.489
speak with you.

861
01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:46.469
