00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.670
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:08.560
today I'm joined by Doctor Matty Hero. He is

4
00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.579
Professor of Philosophy at Alto University School of Business

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.409
in Finland. He is the co-author of anti natal

6
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:21.059
extinction and the end of procreative self corruption, which

7
00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:23.829
we're going to talk about today. So Matty, welcome

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.530
to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.319
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure being here.

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.889
So I've already had a few conversations on the

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.270
show with other authors about anti natal is like

12
00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:39.450
for example, David Benatar, but I, I would like

13
00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.880
to start by asking you what is anti natal

14
00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:46.404
is and perhaps looking back in history and into

15
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:50.145
the contemporary formulations of antenatal is that we have,

16
00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.525
is there one single kind of antenatal is out

17
00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:57.654
there? Multiple kinds? And if there are multiple kinds,

18
00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:59.424
what do they have in common?

19
00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.860
Yes, there are multiple kinds or at least multiple

20
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.089
understandings of Antenatal. And they all the common feature

21
00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.150
is that they all question reproduction in, in one

22
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.879
way or another. But when it comes to specifying

23
00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:21.169
whose reproduction should be questioned and what means, what

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.480
that means in practice. There are differences. So some

25
00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.180
say that we should only be talking about human

26
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.599
procreation. Others would like to include other sentient or,

27
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.819
or living beings. Some say that education and persuasion

28
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.379
are all that we can do or should do

29
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.419
and others might condone more drastic or coercive methods

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.500
of preventing people from having Children.

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.290
And do we know how old anti natal is

32
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.339
in our Western tradition?

33
00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.750
Mm. Well, they are the same as anti natal

34
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.239
is, is, is as old as the Western culture

35
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.470
and, and perhaps older now, Karim Aer uh Antenatal

36
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.570
is quote philosopher and historian has recently drawn our

37
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.149
attention to an ancient Egyptian document. The Iu Papyrus

38
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.100
from the second millennia p ce. So that's long

39
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.259
before any of the Greek stuff started. And that,

40
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.460
that Pap Papyrus is saying, would that there be

41
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.820
an end of men without conception without birth? Then

42
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.699
would the land be quiet from noise and tumult

43
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.360
be no more. So as Erma points out, this

44
00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.910
indicates that anti natal sentiments were expressed even in

45
00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:48.119
writing already centuries before European civilization so called started

46
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.089
with the Greeks.

47
00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.740
And since you mentioned the Greeks, they're going all

48
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.070
the way back to them. What expressions of anti

49
00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.050
natal can we find in their philosophy?

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.009
Well, in Sophocles sixth century BC, we find the

51
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.880
figure of Silenus. Silenus was a mentor and companion

52
00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.490
of Dionysus, the God of wine and cus had

53
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.050
prophetic skills and King Midas, the one who turned

54
00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.050
everything to gold by his touch. Uh He asked

55
00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:27.520
uh um Silenus, what the best human lot would

56
00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.000
be. And the response known as the wisdom of

57
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.339
Silenus was that it would be best not to

58
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.130
be born at all. And if you are uh

59
00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.300
are lucky enough to be b and the second

60
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:42.880
best is to live life as soon as possible,

61
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.940
no one knows for sure what Syle was or

62
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.729
what Sofala was trying to say. But present day

63
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.080
anti Natal Iss hailed this as an early expression

64
00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.199
of the creed.

65
00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.779
Uh AND what would be some of the other

66
00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:03.860
most prominent thinkers back then? Who argued for some

67
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.190
form of anti Natal is or some of its

68
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.190
other related ISMs? And we're going to talk about

69
00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.149
some of those other iss iss later on in

70
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.488
our conversation. But what were some of the other

71
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.420
prominent uh thinkers?

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.609
Yes. First of all, it's not well formed. Anti

73
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.609
Natal is back then during the 6th and 5th

74
00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:31.209
centuries. BCE. But apart from Sophocles, other poets mentioned

75
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.809
the wisdom of, of Silenus, the tags of Megara

76
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.010
in his allergies and those he repeats in his

77
00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:44.109
tragedies and Pre Socratic philosophers also joined the party,

78
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.190
Alex Agora was questioning any higher meaning or purpose

79
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.369
in life. And tales of Miletus was saying that

80
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.989
to love one's Children means not having them. Now

81
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.250
that's pretty anti anti Natal and there are others,

82
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.359
but it's quite scattered and the context and meaning

83
00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.899
of the preserved fragments is often unclear.

84
00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.160
So, something that you also go through in your

85
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.600
book is what you call antenatal list alarms. And

86
00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:18.339
could you tell us about the first one? What

87
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.230
is it that you call the first antenatal alarm?

88
00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:26.049
Yes, the, the alarms. Uh Amanda Zoe and I,

89
00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.790
I identify two main points in the, in the

90
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.070
intellectual history of Europe that this play. Well, shall

91
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:37.359
we say stronger than usual manifestations of antenatal ideas.

92
00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:41.450
The first took place in ancient Greece during the

93
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:45.049
5th and 4th centuries BC. And one of the

94
00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.720
distinctive voices back then was Democritus, uh the founder

95
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.390
of the Atomic school in philosophy. And he thought

96
00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:57.239
that the world is composed of matter of small

97
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.769
uh invisible indivisible particles that come together to form

98
00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.850
the visible and divisible object that we can see

99
00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:10.250
and hear and touch. And this is the scientific

100
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.690
worldview that we still more or less accept. But

101
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.820
Democrats also held the view that people, he and

102
00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:20.829
his peers presumably should not have Children of their

103
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.079
own because bringing them up is difficult and the

104
00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:28.450
results are uncertain, anything can happen. So he said

105
00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.190
that if people must have Children, then they should

106
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.730
adopt Children from their friends. And this way, they

107
00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:37.799
could see the qualities of the new individuals uh

108
00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:41.820
before they, they take on the task of, of

109
00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:42.559
raising them.

110
00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:48.929
And so you mentioned uh a scientific worldview there,

111
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.329
then the sort of first antenatal is alarm relates

112
00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.179
to that and perhaps in a way, also gets

113
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.119
amplified by a scientific worldview.

114
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.359
Mm I mean, and I believe that the wisdom

115
00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.450
of silenus and, and other similar fragments are, are

116
00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:10.089
based on a, on a revelation. Uh SORT of

117
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.459
the revelation is that human life has no cosmic

118
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.890
meaning and silenus control his sorrows in endless orgies.

119
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.339
But in the harsh light of the morning, he

120
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.720
will always confront an empty universe devoid of purpose

121
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.329
if I am being poetic here. Uh And now

122
00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.040
the scientific worldview suggested by critics amplified this lack

123
00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.989
of meaning by saying that they are only atoms

124
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.140
and and their movement in, in the world. And

125
00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:44.070
there are no caring gods who would take care

126
00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:48.399
of people and make their lives worthwhile. Uh Democritus,

127
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.200
no one at that time uh denied the existence

128
00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.429
of God, but he that God is not just

129
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.200
another bunch of atoms living somewhere somewhere in a

130
00:07:57.209 --> 00:08:01.029
different place and not caring about humans at all.

131
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.149
So variations of this revelation that life has no

132
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.040
meaning have surfaced from time to time uh in

133
00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:09.950
the ensuing civilization.

134
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.950
So in the book, you argue for a view

135
00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:18.910
that quote the history of Western philosophy as a

136
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.709
2.5 millennia reaction to anti natal sentiments. And that

137
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.070
quote again, human life has no obvious meaning. And

138
00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:31.350
philosophers have been forced to build elaborate theories to

139
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:35.219
invent imaginary purposes. So could you give us perhaps

140
00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:38.869
a broad explanation for these and then maybe later

141
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.590
we can go through some of the history and

142
00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.349
get into more detail here.

143
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.760
Yes, sure. Uh THE work of Plato uh marks

144
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.619
both the first reaction to an anti natal alarm

145
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.690
and the birth of European philosophy. And please note

146
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.570
that this is interpretation and strong and unusual interpretation

147
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.260
of that. The the standard view is that philosophy

148
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.039
has to gradually liberated revolutionary ideas like anti natal

149
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.659
from authoritarian tradition. But Amanda and I go tentatively

150
00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:17.559
against this view and say that since Plato, most

151
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.190
Western philosophy has been a part of the problem

152
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:24.510
rather than a part of the solution. And, and

153
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.880
here here goes, our our story. Now, Plato presented

154
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.500
against the atoms of democritus, a story of how

155
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.159
the world has come about uh and how there

156
00:09:36.169 --> 00:09:40.030
is cosmic meaning in it after all. Now, according

157
00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:43.729
to Plato, and he is using a myth or

158
00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:46.090
a couple of myths but myths in, in, in

159
00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:50.650
his time, we understood a sort of scientific theories.

160
00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.989
So if you cannot uh explain it by your

161
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.830
eyes and ears, then, then you can, if there's

162
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.630
a suitable myth that could be the truth. Now,

163
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.929
anyway, the method is that the earth and the

164
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.280
planets and the stars and all living beings have

165
00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:08.599
been made uh by an artisan, God. Not exactly

166
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:13.200
a creator, not creating anything from, from nothing but

167
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.919
a composer of things from already existing stuff now

168
00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:21.340
this artisan God started the work from the stars

169
00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:24.479
and the planets and used all the good materials

170
00:10:24.489 --> 00:10:27.429
in shaping them. And when it came to producing

171
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.429
people, only inferior stuff was available and therefore we

172
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.159
are imperfect. So now you know why, why you

173
00:10:34.169 --> 00:10:36.640
are imperfect if you are? I don't know. Uh

174
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.390
ANYWAY, there is a cosmic plan for our perfection.

175
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.010
Uh Originally in our d deficient form, we all

176
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.099
live on our own home stars, everybody has their

177
00:10:47.109 --> 00:10:49.840
own home style and we live in there. But

178
00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:52.570
in birth, we are transferred on earth to become

179
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.140
better. Uh And if our lives go well, then

180
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.940
we can complete the unity of our body, soul

181
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.119
and spirit that's called justice. And then we become

182
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.690
perfect. And when we die, we then go back

183
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.489
to our home stuff. Wow. And we live in

184
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.099
bliss forever contemplating the world of ideas by about

185
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:15.950
this value of the, the shadows quite a story

186
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.969
then. But it does, it comes from Plato. It

187
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.969
comes from uh his uh work at and it

188
00:11:22.979 --> 00:11:25.690
gives meaning both to our lives and to having

189
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.039
Children. So we cannot leave people hanging in the

190
00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:33.059
stars in the imperfect forms. We have to bring

191
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.450
them down here to complete their creation left half

192
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.130
halfway by the artisan God. And that completion that

193
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.460
striving towards justice. That's the cosmic purpose of our

194
00:11:45.469 --> 00:11:50.469
lives. So here uh well done Plato anti Natal

195
00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:54.250
is rejected. A mission accomplished Godless atomist sent back

196
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.479
to the dark corners.

197
00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:00.030
So and do we know what were the first

198
00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:03.510
reactions to anti natal is or at least two

199
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.349
ideas associated with anti natal is in the Western

200
00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:10.000
tradition and who voiced them?

201
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.229
Yes. Atomist soon recovered and came back. Epicurus was

202
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.450
the main figure in the renewal and continued to

203
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.929
argue that life and death have no particular meaning.

204
00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:25.700
The only only thing we can do is to

205
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.849
avoid pain and try to enjoy moderate pleasures to

206
00:12:28.859 --> 00:12:31.690
be in harmony with ourselves or in other words,

207
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.530
to be happy. Uh Epicurean is has in a

208
00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:38.619
sense lived uh to this day, but it has

209
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.330
a bad name in, in many circles. The idea

210
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.200
of seeking pleasure has been interpreted as living in

211
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.450
lust and debauchery and generally being a an immoral

212
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.159
and nasty and detestable person. So traces of epicurean

213
00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:57.539
is survive in utilitarian theories, but those have similar

214
00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:58.849
images problems.

215
00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:05.619
Uh So epicurean is, it could have been something,

216
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.440
I mean, a position in philosophy that could have

217
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.700
carried Greek pessimism forward.

218
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.859
Uh It could have it, it, it's uh i

219
00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:21.049
it's not impossible, but as we'll see, there were

220
00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:22.659
other disruptions in the way.

221
00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:27.309
Mhm uh And talking about those disruptions, uh I

222
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.289
mean, getting into the second anti natal alarm, you

223
00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:36.940
focus on virtue and Christianity. What kind of virtue

224
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.789
are you referring to here? Exactly. And how does

225
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.700
it relate to anti natal then?

226
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.599
Well, in our modern terms, of victorian virtue or,

227
00:13:47.609 --> 00:13:51.000
or sexual virtue, we mean virtue in its carnal

228
00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:56.260
sexual sense. Some people thought 2000 years ago and

229
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.729
many people still believe so, sex is sinful and

230
00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:03.200
vicious and to be avoided by people of virtue,

231
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.630
that's, that's our sense.

232
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:11.400
And do you look at Christianity as also constituting

233
00:14:11.409 --> 00:14:15.219
a reaction to anti natal? And if so in

234
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:15.520
what

235
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:20.450
waves? Well, that's the interesting bit because Christianity in

236
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.530
the beginning constitute uh constituted an anti anti natal

237
00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:28.890
uh reaction. The second anti natal alarm, in fact,

238
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.559
and there were two main elements uh in this

239
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.070
one, uh anything that has to do with flesh

240
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.630
or material being is bad or it's evil and

241
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.330
only the soul or the spirit uh can be

242
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.750
pure and good. So having Children require sex, sex

243
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.510
is flesh, flesh is evil, therefore, don't have them.

244
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.679
And two early Christian teaching was that the second

245
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.989
coming of Jesus is near, it will happen, happen

246
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.099
during the lifetime of his contemporaries. So the teaching

247
00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:06.340
also was that the the end times will be

248
00:15:06.349 --> 00:15:11.659
terrible, much persecution and suffering. Now, bringing Children to

249
00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:14.599
that kind of world would have been all kind

250
00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:16.580
and and in a word insane.

251
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.849
But these were ideas that we can find among

252
00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:24.520
the early Christians, right?

253
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.359
Mm In, in early Christianity, the the gnostics and

254
00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:35.570
the manics uh advocated anti natal is quite strongly

255
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.400
for, for the reasons that I mentioned and some

256
00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:42.780
fragments of those sects are still ongoing, but they

257
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:45.799
are rather secretive and, and their current views on

258
00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:49.510
reproduction are not well known, at least to me

259
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.210
now, there's always been something moving during the 19th

260
00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:58.869
century. Some Christian philosophers, notably the Danish existentialist, sir

261
00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:04.090
and Kirkegaard held distinctly anti natal views uh which

262
00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:08.500
is something that not everybody knows. Uh ANYWAYS. And

263
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.679
as for modern development, there were for a while,

264
00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:17.609
internet groups advocating Christian anti natal, but they were

265
00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:23.190
small and they seem to have disappeared now. And

266
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.690
of course, official churches uh all take a very

267
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.330
dim view on any such views arguing that anti

268
00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:34.070
natal is, is a godless doctrine that rejects God's

269
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.669
greatest gift to humankind, to gift of life.

270
00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:41.260
So still on the topic of Christianity in the

271
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.960
book, you will also talk about the process of

272
00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:48.580
philosophizing Christianity. Uh TELL us about that and what

273
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.440
were some of the main reactions to both pro

274
00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:56.400
Natal and a anti Natal in that process?

275
00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:00.000
Yeah, it's quite an interesting story. The Nordics and

276
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.479
the manic and irritated official states who supported Christianity.

277
00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.550
And so something needed to be done about the

278
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.118
challenge. Now, Augustine of Hippo produced a philosophical response

279
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.199
that was loosely based on Plato's worldview, Amanda. And

280
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:17.420
I are not claiming that, that the church uh

281
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.040
actually uh ordered this, this philosophy from Augustin. But

282
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.030
but there is a, there is a connection in

283
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.489
there. Now, this time, the meaning of human life

284
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.890
was to complete the work of the Christian God.

285
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.089
Remember that it was the artisan God whose work

286
00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:35.209
needed completion the last time around now, it's the

287
00:17:35.219 --> 00:17:37.930
work of the Christian God. So not an almighty

288
00:17:37.939 --> 00:17:41.709
thing then, but whatever we live our lives in

289
00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:45.229
whatever tedium or misery that we may face. But

290
00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:48.930
if we abide by the Christian God's rules, then

291
00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:52.810
after our death, we get to enjoy everlasting bliss

292
00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:55.579
in heaven or as Augustine called it the city

293
00:17:55.589 --> 00:17:59.579
of God. Now, Augustin struggled a little with the

294
00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:03.420
teaching of Paul the apostle uh who had very

295
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.800
critical views on, on sex, but so sex flesh,

296
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.989
blah, blah, blah. But in the end, uh Augustin

297
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.369
took refutes in Paul's dictum. It is better to

298
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.160
marry than to burn uh and justified reproduction by

299
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.489
that. Now, the entire passage in the letter to

300
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.699
the Corinthians says, but if they do not have

301
00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:29.670
sufficient self control, they should marry for, it's better

302
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.810
to marry than to burn with passion. So Paul

303
00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:37.410
was pretty clearly uh frowning upon Caro relations. But

304
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.930
somehow the Christian churches starting with Augustine of Hippo

305
00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:46.040
had been able to turn the fire on extramarital

306
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.770
affairs only and not, not all sex and reproduction.

307
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.339
But so then there was a persecution of the

308
00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:56.609
mannequins and other

309
00:18:56.619 --> 00:19:03.020
agnostics, right? Yes. Coincidentally with the philosophizing of Christianity

310
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.199
after Augustine's work, all heretic sects were more or

311
00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:11.160
less persecuted to death. The methods including genocide were

312
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.680
needed. Antenatal is, was a really dangerous thing to

313
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:15.359
believe in.

314
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.170
So continuing on this history that we are exploring

315
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.839
here, then you talk about a more recent reaction

316
00:19:24.849 --> 00:19:29.270
to unquestioned pro natal that have occurred for the

317
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.989
past 300 years or so. What characterizes this reaction

318
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.329
that is based as you say in the book

319
00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:39.660
on happiness and freedom? And how does it relate

320
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.729
to Antenatal?

321
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.229
Yes, the the pendulum of, of anti natal alarms

322
00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:49.569
or challenges and pro natal reactions to them. They

323
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:53.160
are still still in motion and yes, freedom and

324
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.550
happiness and all that. I, I think that we'll

325
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.699
return to all this later if you don't mind.

326
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.640
Sure. Uh In the book, you also say that

327
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.910
uh and this is going back to an earlier

328
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.420
question related to the other ISMs that were associated

329
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.609
with Antenatal is that it can be conceptually morally,

330
00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:15.920
ideologically and politically connected to these other ISMs and

331
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.000
practices. Uh I mean, uh perhaps uh let's go

332
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:25.069
through the list here. So starting with the abortion.

333
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:27.479
Uh COULD you explain what's obvious,

334
00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:29.030
obvious prevents a birth?

335
00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:31.800
Uh And altruism

336
00:20:32.949 --> 00:20:35.150
if you believe that life is suffering, you don't

337
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.609
bring new life lives into existence

338
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.459
uh and animal rights

339
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.849
and you can extend your altruism to nonhumans by

340
00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:47.739
um by not bringing them into existence either.

341
00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.290
So, another one atheism.

342
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.680
Uh No, God, no meaning why have Children? Ecology,

343
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.760
uh ecology and environmentalism. No more Children, no more

344
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:07.319
increased environmental decay, uh egoism or do you like

345
00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:09.599
Democrat who just want to avoid the burden of

346
00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:12.290
raising your Children and be egoistic about it.

347
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.579
And

348
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:17.339
euthanasia, if life is suffering, why continue it?

349
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.349
Extinction is

350
00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:23.650
if no one has Children, humankind will eventually cease

351
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.290
to exist. So antenatal will lead to lead to

352
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.540
it according to most antenatal

353
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.189
lists. So uh I guess an unexpected one here,

354
00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:34.060
machine consciousness.

355
00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:38.530
Well, if we produce sentient machines and we are

356
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.489
dangerously close to doing that. I mean, intelligence or

357
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.050
artificial intelligence already says intelligent now sentience to that.

358
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.290
And then, well, it's a kind of reproduction. We

359
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.410
are making machine babies at that point.

360
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.050
Uh In Natal.

361
00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:58.890
Well, Natal and pro Natal, they are opposites of

362
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.469
anti Natal. So obviously, mhm

363
00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:03.459
neocolonialism,

364
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.880
if only certain people should stop having Children, the

365
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.630
likely candidates in our current world will be the

366
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.640
inhabitants of the global South. So neo colonialism. Yes.

367
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.719
Uh Nihilism.

368
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.479
If there is no meaning, can there be any

369
00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:20.170
values

370
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.369
uh pessimism.

371
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.760
Uh The starting point of anti Natal is life

372
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.329
is evil.

373
00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:29.119
Uh PRO moralism,

374
00:22:30.229 --> 00:22:34.439
uh pro moralism and connected to that suicide. Some

375
00:22:34.449 --> 00:22:38.040
anti natal take the symmetrical view that if life

376
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.890
should not be initiated, they should not be perpetuated

377
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.050
either. It's a, it's a contested thing.

378
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.270
And the final one that I guess would also

379
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.010
be connected to animal rights veganism.

380
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.150
Yes, if you are an Antenatal because because you

381
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.400
want to avoid bringing about lives with suffering, then

382
00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.689
the idea of not exploiting nonhumans in factory farming

383
00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:04.839
or in any way for your own ends might,

384
00:23:04.979 --> 00:23:06.770
might appeal to you as well.

385
00:23:07.689 --> 00:23:11.469
So, and among all of those in the book,

386
00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:14.839
in section two, you decide to focus on extinction

387
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.949
is why did you decide to focus on this

388
00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:20.250
is specific, specific,

389
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.869
if uh so to speak, the, it's the elephant

390
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.699
in the room of uh contemporary antenatal. Um We

391
00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:30.569
know that it's there but, but no one wants

392
00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:33.020
to talk about it. If, if no one has

393
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.910
Children, then humankind will cease to exist. In fact,

394
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.290
uh but many people who call themselves anti Natal

395
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.949
lists either deny this or try not to talk

396
00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:46.250
about it. And the idea seems to be too

397
00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.579
frightening somehow. So, Amanda and I go through different

398
00:23:49.589 --> 00:23:52.770
scenarios and try to demonstrate that the idea is

399
00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:56.530
not that frightening. All things considered if all human

400
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.939
beings one day want to end reproduction, if big,

401
00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:02.060
if, but if, if they want to do this,

402
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.729
knowing that the species will a few decades later

403
00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:09.459
go extinct, then what's the problem? Of course, some

404
00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:11.859
people say that life is sacred and so on

405
00:24:11.869 --> 00:24:14.520
and so forth, but that's already covered. They, they

406
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.160
will not agree to become Antenatal lists in the,

407
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.369
in the first place. That's bad for Antenatal but

408
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.040
has no effect on the original idea that universally

409
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:30.739
voluntary human extinction if you think about it. And,

410
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.479
and if you get the idea, it, it's, well,

411
00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:36.130
it's very unlikely but it's nothing to be scared

412
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:36.339
of.

413
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.119
So in order to uh explore more, the idea

414
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.819
of extinction is anti Natal is more generally, let's

415
00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:50.260
talk about some common ideas in anti natal is

416
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.709
here. So what constitutes a good life and a

417
00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:58.150
bad life? And what why does that matter for

418
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.260
anti natal lists?

419
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.469
Good question and hotly debate. I am, I am

420
00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:08.050
myself on record saying that everybody should be allowed

421
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.800
to determine the goodness or badness of their own

422
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.930
lives for themselves. I have been a why is

423
00:25:15.939 --> 00:25:19.540
early because that's in a 1990 publication on the

424
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.189
quality of life. So I'm well covered here. So

425
00:25:23.199 --> 00:25:26.630
uh some antenatal lists believe that all human authentic

426
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.000
lives lives are bad in an objective sense and,

427
00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:33.410
and for them, this is a natural justification for

428
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.670
the abuse lives are bad, don't create them.

429
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.300
And when it comes to being against reproduction through

430
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.609
which process do anti natal anti natal lists arrive

431
00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:50.420
at that position. What philosophical path do you think?

432
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.560
Do you think? Exactly.

433
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.050
Hm. There is the all lives are bad approach.

434
00:25:58.469 --> 00:26:02.069
Uh I have my doubts about that one simply

435
00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:05.390
because people are not buying it. They say nonsense.

436
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.739
My life is good and so is my neighbor's

437
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.670
life no use trying to convince them once they

438
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.390
have made up their minds on that one, then

439
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.510
there's the Children have not given the permission to

440
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.569
be brought into existence. T again, I have my

441
00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:24.430
practical doubts. People are not getting that they say.

442
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.109
But I'm happy and grateful that I was brought

443
00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:30.569
into existence. Why wouldn't my Children be end of,

444
00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:34.069
end of discussion? And finally, there is the so

445
00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:38.530
called frik argument. The, the word industry seems to

446
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.349
be that I presented its first formulation in 2004.

447
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.319
I doubt that I was the first, but I'll,

448
00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:49.449
I'll take it, I'll take the accolade anyway. My

449
00:26:49.459 --> 00:26:52.170
point was that wildlife can be good or they

450
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.989
can be bad. You cannot know what, what your

451
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.569
child's life would be like. Therefore, if you are

452
00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:02.790
risk averse person, decision maker, then you don't have

453
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.119
that child. And the usual objections to this are

454
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.400
that a bit of badness is not what life

455
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.349
is all about. Stop mourning and that the probability

456
00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:16.829
of a truly horrible life is very, very small.

457
00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:19.500
We take risks like that every day crossing the

458
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:23.410
streets. People say, well, your question though was what

459
00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.489
philosophical path uh do you take now the arguments

460
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.949
from low quality of life credited to David Benton,

461
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.880
lack of consent credited to C and Citroen and

462
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.329
risk credited to me, they are roughly consequentialist or

463
00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:43.489
outcome oriented. And apart from those, some maintain that

464
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.319
being brought into a life that is manipulated by

465
00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:50.560
other people is a wrong. Julio Cabrera is the

466
00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:54.030
main, main name here. And Amanda and I have

467
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.680
been moving into this Cabrera direction in our own

468
00:27:57.689 --> 00:28:01.160
own way. Don't know with what success

469
00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:06.780
and in your view, would this position against reproduction

470
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.140
extend to all sentient beings or only humans?

471
00:28:12.489 --> 00:28:15.390
Well, the argument, arguments from lack of consent and

472
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.219
manipulation only apply to human beings because they are

473
00:28:19.229 --> 00:28:21.810
the ones who can consent and, and be manipulated

474
00:28:21.819 --> 00:28:24.520
in that sense. But the argument from quality of

475
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.420
life and risk can easily be extended to all

476
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.390
sentient beings and both David Pelata and I do

477
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.310
extend them.

478
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.780
What arguments do you use to support the voluntary

479
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:42.719
extinction of our species even going against some current

480
00:28:42.729 --> 00:28:44.380
ethical ideals?

481
00:28:46.229 --> 00:28:48.699
Actually, I don't think that I need arguments to

482
00:28:48.709 --> 00:28:52.060
support the voluntary extinction of, of humankind. If no

483
00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:55.689
one objects to the idea, then again, what's the,

484
00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:59.069
what's the problem? Uh What are the current ethical

485
00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:01.839
ideas now that, that I should be comparing this

486
00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:06.040
to, well, two interpretations, one avoidance of unnecessary suffering

487
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.790
and respect for autonomy, the happiness and, and freedom

488
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.750
that you, you mentioned earlier. No problem. They, they

489
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.459
are compatible with, with Antenatal and two sanctity of

490
00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:21.739
life and the continuation of the species. The argument

491
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.510
from there is just simply circular. We had to

492
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.000
keep going because we have to keep going. So

493
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.790
there's no mileage in that argument in my book.

494
00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:36.410
And how would you characterize contemporary Western anti Natal?

495
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.109
I wouldn't, I don't know, know enough about the,

496
00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:45.390
the field except that it's quite diverse and, and

497
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.760
finding it its theater. Um And our book is

498
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.430
an attempt to focus the discussion a little, I

499
00:29:51.439 --> 00:29:54.979
may have, may have initiated the argument from, from

500
00:29:54.989 --> 00:29:59.040
risk 20 years ago. But I, the next I

501
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.709
heard of Antenatal was two years ago when Amanda

502
00:30:02.719 --> 00:30:05.680
emailed me and asked me uh to her, her

503
00:30:05.689 --> 00:30:09.020
podcast program telling me that I'm one of the

504
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.449
greatest Antenatal lists of all, all time.

505
00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.270
So let's get a little bit into arguments for

506
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.890
and against having Children. So what would you say

507
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.310
are perhaps some of the most common and standard

508
00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:28.469
arguments for having Children?

509
00:30:29.979 --> 00:30:34.660
Mm With this one, II, I just refer you

510
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.119
to, to the very accessible and Antenatal handbook by

511
00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:43.239
Lawrence Anton. And the even more accessible. The ABC

512
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.540
of Antenatal Culinary book by life sucks. It's all

513
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:51.069
told in those. So no pun intended. But life

514
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:53.430
is too short to go here to go through

515
00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:56.780
all the excuses. It has always been done. God

516
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.459
ordains it. Life is a gift. Your country needs

517
00:30:59.469 --> 00:31:02.949
more producers, consumers and canon for the and so

518
00:31:02.959 --> 00:31:03.819
on and so forth.

519
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.569
Oh, ok. So perhaps what are the ones or

520
00:31:07.579 --> 00:31:09.810
the, the ones that you would say are the

521
00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:12.650
strongest against having Children?

522
00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:17.030
Well, I already listed the three main academic arguments

523
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.280
but the practical arguments of course ranges from the,

524
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.989
from the personal to the political Children don't fit

525
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.510
in my life plan. I would be a bad

526
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.209
parent. The world is becoming a horrible place to

527
00:31:30.219 --> 00:31:33.030
live. You know, I cannot take the responsibility for

528
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.339
a new life under these circumstances, you, you open

529
00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:40.209
open a magazine's lifestyle section and you will find

530
00:31:40.219 --> 00:31:40.640
these.

531
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.280
So we've covered basically procreation here. But what do

532
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:51.079
you mean by procreative self corruption in the

533
00:31:51.089 --> 00:31:55.079
book? Well, if I, if I may 1st uh

534
00:31:55.089 --> 00:31:59.560
Amanda and um and my argument in, in the

535
00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:01.599
book, we have a double argument in here and

536
00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:06.050
this leads me to procreative uh self corruption. So

537
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:11.619
our double argument is that first, anyone who reproduces

538
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.760
opens up the possibility of further reproduction, their Children

539
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.530
will have Children and so on. And so so

540
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.729
sooner or later, some of the children's children's children's

541
00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:26.180
Children will have horrible lives. Not necessarily the first

542
00:32:26.189 --> 00:32:28.920
one, not, not necessarily your Children, not necessarily their

543
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.079
Children, but further on down the line. It's inevitable.

544
00:32:32.089 --> 00:32:34.709
If, if this goes on, then somebody will have

545
00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:38.910
the horrible life, that's how life goes. And it

546
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.229
is with assuming that kind of a responsive uh

547
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:47.739
notion of responsibility. It's your fault, don't do it.

548
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.290
Uh So secondly, you can then raise your Children

549
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.770
to be antenatal list. You can stop the chain

550
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.369
by like that. So now you have the Children,

551
00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.849
you uh make sure that they are happy and,

552
00:32:59.859 --> 00:33:01.489
and you make sure that they, they will never

553
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.099
have Children, but uh you are very unlikely to

554
00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:07.829
do so because if you have broad meaning into

555
00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:11.160
your own life by reproducing, you probably want your

556
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.270
Children to have the same opportunity and you want

557
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.339
them to think that you are a good person.

558
00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:19.609
So in all likelihood, you will bring them up

559
00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:23.319
to be pro natal lists like yourself. And in

560
00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:27.750
doing so, you impose your prenatal mentality and lifestyle

561
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.209
on them. When they are too young to form

562
00:33:30.219 --> 00:33:34.189
their views for themselves, you manipulate them into being

563
00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:37.030
your mental clones. This is where we uh and

564
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.270
Amanda come close to Julio Cabrera. Then what do

565
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.910
we mean by procreative self corruption? Well as Amanda

566
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.579
and I define it, it's a combination of the

567
00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:51.219
two factors, opening up the possibility of the horrible

568
00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:54.729
life sometimes in the future and having to resort

569
00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:59.189
to manipulating your Children in reproductive matters. So by

570
00:33:59.199 --> 00:34:01.839
having a child and then having to make decisions

571
00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:05.689
about its upbringing, you corrupt yourself in at least

572
00:34:05.699 --> 00:34:08.580
one of the one of three ways you make

573
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.279
yourself responsible for a horrible future life, you force

574
00:34:12.289 --> 00:34:15.188
your Children to do the same or you force

575
00:34:15.197 --> 00:34:18.039
your Children to be antenatal lists and thereby deprive

576
00:34:18.049 --> 00:34:20.947
them of the happiness that you have yourself achieved

577
00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:23.159
that in.

578
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:29.929
Could you explain this concept of need frustration? I

579
00:34:29.938 --> 00:34:32.870
mean, what does it mean in your view and

580
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.958
what do you consider right and wrong in regards

581
00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:41.449
to it? Not basic frustration can be, can be

582
00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:44.070
seen as the the only thing that is bad

583
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.560
in itself. It's the only intrinsic negative value. If

584
00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.978
what I do does not lead to anyone's basic

585
00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.879
need frustration, then good and fine, I'm allowed to

586
00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.989
do it. But if what I do does lead

587
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.409
to someone else's basic need frustration, then I'm probably

588
00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:07.179
not allowed to do it. Now, by reproducing I

589
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.830
one open the pathway to the horrible future life

590
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.739
of suffering and to force myself to manipulate my

591
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.830
Children. Uh EITHER to an, an anti natal mindset

592
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.409
to close the pathway or to a pro natal

593
00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:23.909
mindset to keep them happy. Now, suffering and being

594
00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:27.449
manipulated are I believe the main forms of basic

595
00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:31.310
need, frustration. Therefore, I should not reproduce.

596
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.419
So, in the book, you also criticize some of

597
00:35:35.429 --> 00:35:40.719
the most popular recurrent arguments for anti natal. So

598
00:35:40.729 --> 00:35:44.010
let's go through each of them and then talk

599
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.739
about the alternative. You suggest uh starting with arguments

600
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.300
from poor quality of life. What do you make

601
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.300
of them? Are they convincing at all or not?

602
00:35:56.649 --> 00:35:59.810
They are convincing to me personally, I believe that

603
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.110
no life would have been better than my life.

604
00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:06.149
What I don't believe is that people in general

605
00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:08.590
would be convinced by this life is good. They

606
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.729
say, and that's the end of the argument.

607
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.739
A and what about the asymmetry of good and

608
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.139
bad?

609
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.649
This is implied in my, in my need approach.

610
00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:25.280
We should not bring about bad lives, even the

611
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.540
eventual future bad life because that would involve causing

612
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:34.090
bad uh allowing basic need frustration in my vocabulary.

613
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.750
Now, some say that we should bring about good

614
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.850
lives though the argument from asymmetry has it that

615
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.879
while there is an obligation to avoid bringing about

616
00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:48.610
bad lives, there is no corresponding duty to promote,

617
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.199
bringing about good ones. And I say that we

618
00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:55.459
have no obligation to do so because non existent

619
00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:58.610
beings don't have any needs. So I think that

620
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.179
my, my way is more elegant and I uh

621
00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:05.169
I must drop a year again 1994 in my

622
00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:08.280
book, Liberal Utilitarianism. And I applied ethics in a

623
00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.689
footnote, I say exactly that there is no need

624
00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:16.340
to become into existence. So uh no need need

625
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.780
based argument about that. So they basically the the

626
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.159
basic needs of those who don't exist, cannot be

627
00:37:22.169 --> 00:37:24.959
frustrated simply because they don't have any. They are

628
00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:28.550
not there, there's no one there, but I can

629
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.439
understand this and, and looking in into your eyes,

630
00:37:32.449 --> 00:37:35.030
I can see that you understand this. But this

631
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.479
argument is far, far, far, far too complicated for

632
00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:42.449
members of the general public to understand nonsense. They

633
00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:45.409
say I'm happy to be alive. And so would

634
00:37:45.419 --> 00:37:48.379
my unborn Children and denying them that happiness means

635
00:37:48.389 --> 00:37:52.479
frustrating their needs. Whatever you say, Mr philosopher, smarty

636
00:37:52.489 --> 00:37:57.260
pants and no amount of argumentation will change their

637
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.899
minds. So no way. Symmetry for them, I think.

638
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.270
So, perhaps another kind of argument that it's also

639
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.500
hard for the general public to understand. What do

640
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.020
you make of arguments based on the lack of

641
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.939
consent?

642
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.379
Yes, like the other two, it's just unintuitive non

643
00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:20.850
existing individuals cannot consent to being bored. No, but

644
00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.050
they cannot consent to not be born uh either.

645
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.429
So, talking about uh consent in their case seems

646
00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:32.790
to be somehow off target or even ridiculous. It

647
00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:35.479
does have a place somewhere in the anti natal

648
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.379
argumentation. It does have a distinct place in there

649
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.820
but it just too complicated to, to be used

650
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.570
outside the specialist discussion or that's what I think.

651
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.810
So, getting into your alternative argument, then you say

652
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.080
that what near universal meaning in life can be

653
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.590
secured, but only by imposing a pro natal lifestyle

654
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.800
upon new individual individuals in a manipulative way that

655
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.669
we should no longer consider attractive or acceptable. So,

656
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.620
could you explain the argument here and what would

657
00:39:10.629 --> 00:39:14.370
be exactly the anti natal argument?

658
00:39:15.479 --> 00:39:18.919
Yes. Our whole book is based on the premise

659
00:39:18.929 --> 00:39:22.439
that European culture has been in search of meaning

660
00:39:22.669 --> 00:39:26.260
for the duration of its existence, the wisdom of

661
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:31.889
silenus and other expressions of ancient Greek pessimism evidence

662
00:39:31.899 --> 00:39:34.739
that people felt an absence of a greater purpose.

663
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.229
Plato's theory explained that we are here to complete

664
00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:42.169
an artist on God's work. And Augustine of Hippo's

665
00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:45.389
version of Christianity said the same in terms of

666
00:39:45.399 --> 00:39:49.100
the Christian God, we are actors, characters uh in

667
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.129
a divine comedy and it is our job to

668
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:55.300
make God great. Again, we can use that slogan

669
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.070
uh somewhere. Well, in, in time, of course, uh

670
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.830
religion faded away from, from people's minds and the

671
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.590
image of God grew even in, in the minds

672
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.560
of those who believed in God, the image of

673
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.270
God grew weaker and weaker. So in the secularized

674
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.270
parts of the world, no one can seriously argue

675
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.020
that the meaning of our lives is to have

676
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.310
Children to please God doesn't work like that. And

677
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.729
this raises the question, where should we find the

678
00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:26.600
meaning then? And the current response as far as

679
00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.229
I can see, uh as far as I can

680
00:40:29.239 --> 00:40:33.300
see with Amanda seems to be in self fulfillment

681
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.889
through having off. That's the lifestyle section as today.

682
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.350
So when it comes to finding purpose or meaning

683
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.959
in life, what would you say would be the

684
00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:51.070
main differences between doing it via a pro natal

685
00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:55.320
route versus an anti natal route?

686
00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.969
Oh, there's a, there's a difference anti natal don't,

687
00:41:00.979 --> 00:41:04.189
don't have to find a bigger cosmic meaning to

688
00:41:04.199 --> 00:41:08.090
their lives. Life can be just about bearable, but

689
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.750
it's, it is void of meaning and purpose. So

690
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.709
let's get rid of it by stopping reproduction. At

691
00:41:13.719 --> 00:41:16.919
least it's only the poor prono natal who have

692
00:41:16.929 --> 00:41:21.169
to struggle here. They want life to continue, but

693
00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:24.750
to what avail they have to find a purpose

694
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.350
and meaning. And if philosophy and theology uh don't

695
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.790
help, then it must be in the activity itself,

696
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.280
making more life is meaningful because making more life

697
00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.389
gives our life its meaning, it's circular. But there

698
00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:38.850
you go.

699
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.500
So taking into account what we talked about earlier

700
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.830
when it comes to the main current arguments in,

701
00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:52.459
in anti Natal is how they are difficult for

702
00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:55.689
the general public to understand they are really an

703
00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:59.000
intuitive in what ways would you say your argument

704
00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.139
here could strengthen the anti Natal is movement.

705
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.239
It's early days yet to say anything, anything about

706
00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.959
that, Amanda and I have been working together only

707
00:42:10.969 --> 00:42:13.189
a couple of years and we are still looking

708
00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:18.629
for the perfect convincing, understandable argument for anti natal.

709
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.969
The the idea of not having Children is so

710
00:42:22.979 --> 00:42:26.629
strange to most people that it's difficult to express

711
00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:30.959
it in a palatable form. I think that the

712
00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:33.679
the risk part of our argument that parents make

713
00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:36.370
themselves responsible for a very bad life somewhere in

714
00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:40.229
the future, it could resonate with quite a few

715
00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:44.449
in these times of political turmoil and ecological decay.

716
00:42:44.459 --> 00:42:48.840
Of course, the manipulation part of the argument is

717
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.239
a harder sell. It's basically claiming that parents commit

718
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.840
their Children to procreative slavery. So I'm I'm not

719
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.889
really holding my my breath in that.

720
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.270
So finally, in the book, you go through some

721
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.239
of or perhaps all of the possible roots for,

722
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.560
as you say, ending procreative self corruption and having

723
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.280
an anti natal society. So let's talk about them

724
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:20.010
starting with the big yellow button or technological removal

725
00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.399
of suffering. What would these

726
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.860
1313 ways and means that we live? OK. So

727
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.350
the big yellow but the technological removal of suffering,

728
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:33.139
right? The the David Pierce solution, we cannot make

729
00:43:33.149 --> 00:43:37.000
people uh to stop having Children. So let's stop

730
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.790
suffering in some other way by medicine and technology.

731
00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.629
In the book. I think that Amanda and I

732
00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:46.090
just say that this is not going to happen.

733
00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:50.669
It just isn't uh on hindsight, I would add

734
00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:54.000
to this that even if it were successful, then

735
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.750
it would not remove the problem of parental manipulation.

736
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.560
But that's the topic of some future book or

737
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.159
article.

738
00:44:01.879 --> 00:44:06.120
So another button, the big orange button. This one

739
00:44:06.129 --> 00:44:11.000
is about immortality by biomedical gerontology. What do you

740
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:11.639
make of it?

741
00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.989
Yes, it's a, it's a way way of being

742
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.070
anti natal but avoiding the demise or at least

743
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.290
a quick demise of, of humankind. So no more

744
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.010
Children but people live forever. Uh IF not met

745
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.800
by external violence, of course. So it's a nice

746
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.090
idea if you happen to like it, go for

747
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.969
it if you must as long as you don't

748
00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:33.610
have Children

749
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:40.120
and, and the big red button obliteration of humankind.

750
00:44:40.659 --> 00:44:43.350
Yes. Well, that would solve the problem of, of

751
00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.020
suffering once and for, for all I am a

752
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.969
voluntary human extinction is myself. So I would say

753
00:44:48.979 --> 00:44:51.909
go ahead if, if no one objects uh then

754
00:44:51.919 --> 00:44:56.169
again, someone will object. Uh There, there's an ongoing

755
00:44:56.179 --> 00:45:01.510
discussion within certain anti natal circles on the advisability

756
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.989
of talking about this opinion publicly at all.

757
00:45:05.739 --> 00:45:08.389
So we have a few more buttons here. The

758
00:45:08.399 --> 00:45:13.070
violet one is immigration to virtual reality.

759
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.520
So this would mean uploading our minds to a

760
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.449
computer world and living forever in digital or, or

761
00:45:20.459 --> 00:45:23.979
in the future, whatever more advanced bliss world, aren't

762
00:45:23.989 --> 00:45:28.459
we already? Anyway? Um Our quite innovative uh uh

763
00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:31.320
if I say so myself, objection to this one

764
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.139
was that it would be a form of reproduction.

765
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.560
Uh If it's brought to its conclusion, uh our

766
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.840
minds would not be moved to virtual uh reality

767
00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:44.969
in this mind, uploading, instead we would die and

768
00:45:44.979 --> 00:45:48.060
someone else would have to assume a life based

769
00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.669
partly on our experience. So in other words, that

770
00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:53.850
would not be antenatal at all.

771
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.290
So uh two more buttons, uh the blue one

772
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.750
is irreversible collective infertility. What is that

773
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.600
about? Yes, it's an alternative to the big red

774
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.419
button. It would be kinder to let people live

775
00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:15.780
out their lives, just not having Children. And that's,

776
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.320
that's the the point here. And if I recall

777
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.409
our reaction to this was yuck, really? So instead

778
00:46:23.419 --> 00:46:26.310
of a nice clean demise, you would commit the

779
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.379
remaining generations to meaningless misery for, for the rest

780
00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:32.790
of their lives. So not our cup of tea.

781
00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.139
So, and the last button before we move on

782
00:46:36.149 --> 00:46:40.979
to other alternatives, the big green button humankind makes

783
00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:43.419
room for other species.

784
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:50.729
Yes, sir. Patricia mccormack's brilliant abolitionist, vitalism, humankind uh

785
00:46:50.739 --> 00:46:55.780
dies away voluntarily, but with its last caring practices

786
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.620
leaves a mark and uh lives on in the

787
00:46:59.629 --> 00:47:04.770
harmonious without humans uh world to come, we didn't

788
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.949
quite see how that would be done in practice.

789
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.229
But yeah, go for it. I say no, any

790
00:47:11.239 --> 00:47:13.379
anything with, without reproduction.

791
00:47:14.489 --> 00:47:19.399
And then there's also other alternatives like anti natal

792
00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:25.179
superwomen or superman. What does this mean?

793
00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.250
Yeah, that would be a person with superpowers who

794
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.399
comes to the rescue devices. An anti natal plan

795
00:47:32.409 --> 00:47:35.989
gets everyone to accept and, and off we go

796
00:47:36.229 --> 00:47:40.909
off, we go literally uh wonderful, of course. But

797
00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:43.540
uh let's say highly improbable.

798
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.439
And what about an anti natal list dictatorship?

799
00:47:49.479 --> 00:47:52.739
Unfortunately, that one is a more probable scenario and

800
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.810
it's, it's not a good one. Lots of suffering,

801
00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.419
uncertain outcome. I wouldn't, I wouldn't suggest it.

802
00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:03.870
And then there's also the idea of an anti

803
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:07.169
natal list cult or religion. What do you think

804
00:48:07.179 --> 00:48:07.750
about it?

805
00:48:09.179 --> 00:48:12.669
Mm. Mm. Well, it was already tried by the

806
00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:15.560
gnostics and the man and ended up in, in

807
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.760
tears. But, but different time it might, might work

808
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:25.310
a nice new age movement to uh towards antenatal

809
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.110
and who knows someone could try

810
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.899
then uh one that would probably be a little

811
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:37.610
bit more palatable to modern years. Anti natal liberal

812
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.560
democracy.

813
00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:42.389
Yeah. Mm. This is not in sight for the

814
00:48:42.399 --> 00:48:45.350
time being. That's the problem I wouldn't mind. But

815
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.820
the, the, the world doesn't really seem to be

816
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:52.399
developing into that direction or is it, I mean,

817
00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:57.189
more freedom of opinion, reproductive autonomy coming back to

818
00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:01.229
the freedom and happiness. Again, realization of the horrors

819
00:49:01.239 --> 00:49:04.709
of the world or maybe something, something is brewing.

820
00:49:04.719 --> 00:49:05.550
It would be nice.

821
00:49:06.669 --> 00:49:10.100
And what about rational persuasion? Do you think that

822
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:10.889
could work?

823
00:49:11.659 --> 00:49:15.340
Mm. It's, it is the only ethical way to,

824
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:19.270
to proceed. It doesn't seem to be working fantastically,

825
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.449
but perhaps it's early, early days yet, perhaps liberal

826
00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:28.040
democracy and rational persuasion together will move people's minds.

827
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.669
So we just, we, we have to believe in

828
00:49:30.679 --> 00:49:33.469
that to continue with this work. So fingers crossed.

829
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.159
Uh And there's also the alternative of canning of

830
00:49:38.169 --> 00:49:39.479
reason. What is

831
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:42.850
the kind of reason is, is at the same

832
00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.060
time, the the most difficult and the and the

833
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:49.000
easiest idea to, to explain now, the more difficult

834
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:52.479
uh uh is that it, it's philosophical Georg Wilhelm

835
00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:56.760
Friedrich Hegel, the 18th and 19th century German philosopher

836
00:49:56.959 --> 00:50:00.479
suggested that the world is developing pretty much without

837
00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:05.429
human intention. There are ideas that clash and develop

838
00:50:05.439 --> 00:50:09.780
uh but humankind is for all intents and purposes,

839
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.679
just a spectator in this play in the end,

840
00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:17.310
according to Hegel, freedom will be victorious and we

841
00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.719
can only admire its its blossoming from the audience.

842
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.699
Well, be that as it may in the real

843
00:50:23.709 --> 00:50:27.300
world, the idea is simple. What we think we

844
00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.810
are doing bigger forces are already moving us towards

845
00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.330
the end of reproduction. People's self-interest, reduce birth rates,

846
00:50:35.669 --> 00:50:41.489
pollution reduces sperm counts, education reduces uh women's willingness

847
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.810
to have Children and so on. So according to

848
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.840
this cunning of reason thing, we don't have to

849
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:50.850
do anything about it. Antenatal is, is already on

850
00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.310
the way.

851
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.959
So one final route then uh the root of

852
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:58.100
the benevolent machine.

853
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.899
Yes. And finally the technological version of the cunning,

854
00:51:02.909 --> 00:51:08.580
cunning of reason, machine intelligence so-called is increasing in

855
00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:13.000
efficiency and scope and uh sooner or later it

856
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:16.889
is predicted there will be a computer. Uh THAT

857
00:51:16.899 --> 00:51:20.389
is who is cleverer and kinder than we are.

858
00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:24.540
And that computer, if it has access to everything

859
00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:28.179
else in the world can decide to help humankind.

860
00:51:28.409 --> 00:51:31.489
The machine thinks people will never on their own,

861
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:36.100
stop their suffering. So they need assistance. And then

862
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.320
the benevolent omnipotent machine presses the big red button

863
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:43.379
and we are all history. Oh, happy day.

864
00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:47.560
So uh let me just ask you one last

865
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.010
question. Uh The, this will be the last question

866
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.770
of our conversation today and regarding these different possible

867
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.330
routes, which are the ones that you would support

868
00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.050
the most. Do you think that any of them

869
00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.459
is superior to all the others or would you

870
00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:05.250
support perhaps a combination of them

871
00:52:06.219 --> 00:52:08.560
national persuasion is the, is the only thing that

872
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.459
we can explicitly do. And then of course, follow

873
00:52:11.469 --> 00:52:14.439
the developments of is the cult coming somewhere. If

874
00:52:14.449 --> 00:52:20.060
the, if the liberal in liberal democracy are tendencies

875
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:23.439
that go towards Antenatal is and then the answer

876
00:52:23.449 --> 00:52:26.520
for now is no, they are are not because

877
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.899
it isn't happening in the global South and in

878
00:52:28.909 --> 00:52:31.719
the global North we are now worrying about the

879
00:52:31.729 --> 00:52:36.820
population, native population of, of our own own country.

880
00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.219
So uh restaurant per population.

881
00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:45.129
OK. So the book is again anti Natal Extinction

882
00:52:45.139 --> 00:52:48.969
and the end of procreative self corruption. I'm leaving

883
00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:50.860
a link to it in the description box of

884
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:54.540
the interview. And uh Matty, apart from the book,

885
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:56.469
would you like to tell people where they can

886
00:52:56.479 --> 00:52:59.179
find you and the rest of your work on

887
00:52:59.189 --> 00:52:59.899
the internet?

888
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:05.709
And I think that the exploring Anti Natal podcast

889
00:53:05.719 --> 00:53:12.149
site has all my exploits listed somewhere probably in

890
00:53:12.159 --> 00:53:17.909
the exploring anti Natal podcast number 65 which is

891
00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:20.429
the first episode that I and I, I did

892
00:53:20.439 --> 00:53:22.919
together. I, I think that in, in the comments

893
00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:25.649
of that uh they are whatever they are called

894
00:53:25.659 --> 00:53:29.679
citation trees or, or source trees or, or whatever

895
00:53:29.689 --> 00:53:32.340

00:53:32.669 --> 00:53:34.209
