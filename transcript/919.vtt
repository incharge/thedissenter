00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.739
Decent. I'm your host, as always Ricardo Ops. And

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.020
today I'm joined by Doctor Isabella Sarto Jackson. She

4
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.760
is lecturer in Cognitive Science at the University of

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.060
Vienna, guest lecturer in Cognitive Biology at the University

6
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.110
of Bratislava, Executive Manager of the Conrad Lawrence Institute

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.799
for Evolution and Cognition Research and president of the

8
00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:28.040
Austrian Neuroscience Association. And today we're focusing on her

9
00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:31.850
great book, The Making and Breaking of Minds, How

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.419
social interaction shaped the human mind. So, Doctor Sarto

11
00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:39.400
Jackson, welcome to the show. It's an immense pleasure

12
00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.000
to everyone.

13
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:43.369
Thank you very much Ricardo for having me. It's

14
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.549
a great pleasure to, to share my insights with

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.990
you and uh hopefully everybody who's going to listen

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.959
to this podcast.

17
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.970
Thank you. So, I mean, we have lots of

18
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.389
ground to cover here because there are many, many

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.069
things associated with how we approach the study of

20
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.599
the human mind, human psychology. But let's start perhaps

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.269
with uh DNA because as I read in your

22
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.519
book, that's also one of the places you primarily

23
00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:19.059
came from and actually have already had many interviews

24
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.309
with, for example, behavior geneticists on the show. And

25
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.949
so, uh, particularly about these sort of nature versus

26
00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.410
nurture debate and the focus that sometimes we have

27
00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:36.470
on DNA or, mm, much of the time indeed

28
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.470
we have on DNA. Do genes really hold precise

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.639
instructions to create a being with all its, in

30
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.349
this particular case, psychological traits.

31
00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:52.669
Mhm. Yeah. Thank you very much. Um, VERY important

32
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.169
question. And, um, this is something that, as you

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.339
already said, um, this, uh I, I started as

34
00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.120
a geneticist, my master was in gen in genetics

35
00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:06.169
in his genetics actually. And this is uh something

36
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.288
I've been thinking about a lot. And uh actually,

37
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.770
um the beginning of my book um is dealing

38
00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.940
exactly with that topic. So, um one of the

39
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.369
things that I would like to start with is

40
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.619
that um I have very strong doubts about this

41
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.779
strict gene deterministic way because it's very simplified. Uh

42
00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.259
AND it's especially unhelpful if we talk about the

43
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.610
human brain or cognitive processes because there we have

44
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:46.220
so many causal factors that underlie the organism and

45
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.220
the human mind. So this nature nurtured dichotomy is

46
00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:54.509
actually to my mind, some sort of obfuscation which

47
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.300
has its historical roots in going back to the

48
00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:03.720
17th century. Um IT frames nature in this very

49
00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.830
simplistic way we look at um the DNA as

50
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:13.470
if it holds the alive information. Um And on

51
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:17.649
the other hand, you have this environment which is

52
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.100
completely separate from the organism. And as we know,

53
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.210
now this is much more intertwined. So there is

54
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.889
a dynamic interplay between genes and environment and this

55
00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:33.820
interplay is mediated by the organism actually with its

56
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.509
active involvement. So importantly, I would say there is

57
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.929
like reciprocal interaction between organism and environment. And from

58
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.419
that point of view, it doesn't make sense to

59
00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.830
s uh artificially separate bio, biological and environmental factors

60
00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.529
historically, that might have had benefits to study um

61
00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:00.369
certain aspects. But I think it's time to overcome

62
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.229
this dichotomy.

63
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.750
Mhm. But I, I mean, just to be fair

64
00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:09.399
here, do you think that at least most behavior,

65
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.350
geneticists are really genetic determinist because, I mean, at

66
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.428
least with most people I talk with on the

67
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.910
show, uh, I, I guess that all of them

68
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.709
acknowledge the role of the, the, the role of

69
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.750
the environment. Of course, they talk about heritability about

70
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.570
twin study. Some of them put a little bit

71
00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.190
more emphasis on genes, some of them a little

72
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.929
bit more emphasis on the environment. It also depends

73
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.190
on the traits we're talking about. Right. But, II,

74
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.170
I mean, uh, do you agree that perhaps, uh,

75
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:46.730
be more, at least most behavior geneticists do not

76
00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:50.125
tend to be, uh, genetic determines

77
00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:54.984
neither. II, I definitely agree because we've come a

78
00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:58.404
long way since. And of course, um, it was

79
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:01.684
the geneticist who kind of disentangled a lot of

80
00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:05.404
factors and saw that there was a lot, uh

81
00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:10.375
missing in the picture. However, historically, keep in mind

82
00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:15.304
that it was um this, this uh behavioral genetics

83
00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:19.299
was always seen like a one way street. So

84
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:21.799
you had the genes that were kind of in

85
00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:27.500
control. And uh on the other hand, um you

86
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.760
had uh environment separated. Um WHEN we look at

87
00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:37.670
it, I think now, um then we have to

88
00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.829
acknowledge that there are at least three contributing factor

89
00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:45.260
that shape behavior. We have the variability that's within

90
00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.679
the gene in the genes in in the genome.

91
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.359
Then we have a variability depending on environment, social

92
00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:56.779
environment, cultural environment. And then we have the variability

93
00:05:56.859 --> 00:06:00.970
in the phenotypic trait. And this and here, II,

94
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.980
I fully agree by now, most acknowledge that phenotypic

95
00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:12.390
traits are polygenic and multifactorial. Um Yeah. So, so

96
00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.660
maybe one more thing is that uh one has

97
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.839
to be very careful when thinking about um genes

98
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.119
as they call that the most important factors that

99
00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.630
um very often one also implies some sort of

100
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.220
causality. And that is misleading because uh to disentangle

101
00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.769
um causality based on the genome versus the environment,

102
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.910
that's quite um a task that requires uh much

103
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.250
more than just looking at the, the um at,

104
00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.649
at the underlying uh genetic sequences. Mhm A

105
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.720
and of course, throughout our conversation, we're going to

106
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.040
get into each of the specific factors that play

107
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:08.209
a role in our uh in the development of

108
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.519
our psychology. I mean, it's genes of course, but

109
00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.589
it's also gene expression. And apart from genetics. Again,

110
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.605
we have the environment, we have the social context

111
00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:21.785
we have culture, we have, by the way, not

112
00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:23.695
just the brain but also the rest of the

113
00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:25.785
body. I guess we're going to talk about that

114
00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.454
as well. But ju just before we move on

115
00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:32.535
to this idea that you explain in the book

116
00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:38.204
of thinking about genetic susceptibility instead of genetic determinism

117
00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:41.980
just before we get into that. So what do

118
00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:46.059
can we make of, for example, uh twin studies

119
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.160
and adoption studies? Because I mean, even though genes

120
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.679
of course, are not the entire picture here, they

121
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.859
still play some role. So what do you think?

122
00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:00.540
What would you say is perhaps the informa the

123
00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:04.339
useful information we can get from the twin and

124
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.059
adoption?

125
00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:12.980
Yeah. So, um again, um in the light of

126
00:08:12.989 --> 00:08:17.100
um the history of how these studies have been

127
00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:22.200
um conceptualized and performed, they were really important in

128
00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:29.260
trying to disentangle uh nature versus nurture. Um ESPECIALLY

129
00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:34.000
because uh most of the traditional studies like uh

130
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:41.219
pedigree analysis or genealogical methods, they um always assumed

131
00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.020
um that there was a bimodal distribution of in

132
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:50.109
of traits within the population. Now with uh twin

133
00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:57.770
studies, um it was easier to um find um

134
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.820
a good me or to have a good method

135
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.090
at hand uh to appraise uh the hereditary environmental

136
00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:10.760
problem with respect to non bimodal characteristics, at least

137
00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:16.020
in theory. Um However, again, here we have the

138
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:23.039
problem that also twin studies are phenotypic correlation studies.

139
00:09:23.049 --> 00:09:27.640
So, again, underlying causalities cannot be deducted from that.

140
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.489
Um And um maybe the other thing that uh

141
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.250
also have to has to be kept in mind

142
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:42.890
is that um we have to um also think

143
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.409
uh about when, when doing these um association studies

144
00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:51.969
is uh to make sure uh that we control

145
00:09:51.979 --> 00:09:57.010
for confounding factors. And although twin studies of course,

146
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.289
give a much better handle to study uh this,

147
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.460
this uh uh uh the, the, the um entanglement

148
00:10:05.469 --> 00:10:10.679
between or to disentangle um environment and, and um

149
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.630
and biology. Um WE should not forget that um

150
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:20.330
also in twins, there is can be a lot

151
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.780
of underlying confounding factors and they also have to

152
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:27.849
be uh they, they're very often neglected. Um I'm

153
00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:30.059
aware that this has come a long way and

154
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.200
of course, um it's a lot more um it's

155
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.380
uh there is much more evidence now um for

156
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.140
what you can study and what, what uh what

157
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:48.059
points cannot be elucidated. Um Yeah. So importantly, maybe

158
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.549
just as a final sentence is one of the

159
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:54.830
most important recent outcomes from neurobiology is that even

160
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.289
in twin studies, it has been shown that the

161
00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:05.039
anatomy of the brain varies relatively significantly. So, um

162
00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:07.109
there are some areas where it's perfect where we

163
00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:09.580
have perfect correlation with other areas. But there is

164
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:15.080
some significant variation even between um Moocs psychotic twins

165
00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:17.349
that have exactly the same genome.

166
00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:22.469
Mhm A and that of course, has to do.

167
00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:26.109
I would imagine when it comes to, for example,

168
00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:30.820
neonates with the fact that during brain development in

169
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.520
the uterus, there are many stochastic events that play

170
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.489
a role that we can't really entirely predict and

171
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.434
that are not predictable just by genes themselves. That's

172
00:11:45.445 --> 00:11:48.875
just one example. Right, then we also have levels

173
00:11:48.885 --> 00:11:53.734
of hormones and the ways by which perhaps uh

174
00:11:53.744 --> 00:11:57.924
neurons establish connections with one another that have to

175
00:11:57.934 --> 00:12:01.565
do with many different factors that are not entirely

176
00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:05.484
written in the genes neither. So there are many

177
00:12:05.494 --> 00:12:09.510
things like that that could lead even uh immediately

178
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.369
after birth to two identical twins already having from

179
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.539
the outset slightly different uh brains. And then of

180
00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:22.580
course, as they grow older as they have their

181
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.390
unique life experiences and we're going to get into

182
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.890
that later, of course, their brains become even more

183
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.450
dissimilar. But those are some of the factors that

184
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.969
play a role there. Right.

185
00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:36.979
Exactly. So, exactly what you're saying. So there is

186
00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:41.950
already a quite a significant degree of randomness um

187
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.539
because the amount of genes that we have um

188
00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:50.340
even in considering all the splice variants and so

189
00:12:50.349 --> 00:12:54.039
on, they can never. Um So we're talking about

190
00:12:54.049 --> 00:13:01.229
maybe 22,000 genes. Um THEY can never um and

191
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.340
program or give an exact blueprint of the connections

192
00:13:07.349 --> 00:13:13.900
of uh 86 billion neurons, let alone uh 10

193
00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:17.000
to the power of 15 synaptic connections. So that

194
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:17.979
would not be possible.

195
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.510
Uh, AND so, uh, I mean, what would genetic

196
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.609
susceptibility mean here in the, in this particular context

197
00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:32.539
if we are rejecting the idea of genetic, uh,

198
00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:38.830
genetic determinism, which I think most people nowadays reject,

199
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.070
uh, what would it mean to say that perhaps,

200
00:13:42.429 --> 00:13:49.030
uh, there are some genetic susceptibility to developing certain

201
00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.250
particular traits?

202
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.830
Mhm. Yeah, that's, that's a very interesting question. And,

203
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.690
um, um, I just want to point out that

204
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.830
although I use susceptibility myself very often, uh when

205
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.960
it comes to development, I actually prefer um thinking

206
00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:12.250
about potentiality, thinking about what, what's, what is the

207
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.409
underlying uh potential that the genes give us. So,

208
00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.530
whereas susceptibility has always this negative connotation that is

209
00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:27.000
related to sensitivity like being predisposed to, for a

210
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.020
drug or, or um to, to a disease or

211
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.849
something. So, so what is the susceptibility? This is

212
00:14:34.859 --> 00:14:39.969
kind of um a potential that is written in

213
00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:45.900
our genome um that allows us to unfold uh

214
00:14:45.909 --> 00:14:50.599
certain traits. Um But this very much depends on

215
00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:53.570
uh stimuli from the outside and that can be

216
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.255
um the ecological environment, the social environment, there can

217
00:14:58.265 --> 00:15:03.265
be um factors that come even from just from

218
00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:08.674
the internal environment, like positional information, depending you know,

219
00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:13.114
which place within the organism certain cells have. So

220
00:15:13.244 --> 00:15:17.544
basically, as I see it is we have uh

221
00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:21.570
a huge potential that's written in our genome and

222
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.299
whether it's realized or not depends on very many

223
00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:27.929
factors and to be honest, there is many, many

224
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:37.440
more um uh information, let's say passive information um

225
00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:40.859
that is never realized because we just haven't got

226
00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:43.659
the environment for it. Um I like to call

227
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:45.619
it um a colleague of mine used to call

228
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.570
it and I have taken that that phrase because

229
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.700
I like it so much. Um That's uh Darwin's

230
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.849
hit the ink, you know, he's written, it's written

231
00:15:53.969 --> 00:15:57.780
but in a yet invisible way and only being

232
00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:02.489
exposed to certain stimuli to certain environmental factors, then

233
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.979
the potential unfolds.

234
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.419
Mhm A and when it comes to the environment

235
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:15.020
itself, I mean, how easy or hard is it

236
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:20.460
to study the impact of specific environmental factors on

237
00:16:20.469 --> 00:16:25.460
human psychology and development? I mean, because of course,

238
00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:30.929
there's a myriad of things happening around us at

239
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.619
the same time and some of them might influences,

240
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.059
some others do not influence us. But I, I

241
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.940
mean, uh uh how is your heart? Is it

242
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.090
for us to really be able to know what

243
00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:49.460
aspects of the environment have an impact on human

244
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.539
psychology?

245
00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:55.719
Well, yeah, that's a great question. And um here,

246
00:16:55.729 --> 00:16:58.450
I would like to draw a parallel to um

247
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:03.039
to, to genome studies actually, when genome studies were

248
00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:07.400
set out, um originally, most of these studies were

249
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.890
dedicated to uh investigate individual genes. Like I remember

250
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.348
myself, I've been involved in projects where we knocked

251
00:17:16.358 --> 00:17:23.098
out individual genes in um in his strains. So

252
00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:26.430
uh and then only with the advent of um

253
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:33.689
different better methodologies and um more uh uh encompassing

254
00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:39.900
um techniques like than um the, the um genome

255
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:47.380
wide studies there. Um You got a different handle

256
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.680
on looking uh Ooo on many factors of many

257
00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:54.140
genes at the same time. Now, in parallel, when

258
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.920
we now consider um the the environment, we, we're

259
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.619
kind of uh almost at the beginning. I no,

260
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.489
not quite, but there is much. So we're lagging

261
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.260
behind, we only took now the environment into the

262
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.800
consideration. However, a lot has already been done um

263
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:20.369
with studies coming from the expos. So what's interesting

264
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.369
there is you take a lot of different factors,

265
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.250
external factors that might be global factors or external

266
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.390
factors, that might be very specific or internal factors

267
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:37.510
and all these factors together uh might give you

268
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.890
a more complete picture if you combine that with

269
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.989
uh genome wide association studies. And moreover, and that

270
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.829
must not be forgotten, you take all this information,

271
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:54.050
all this data. Um BUT you have to also

272
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.180
follow the developmental trajectory because this is what makes

273
00:18:58.189 --> 00:19:01.920
the picture complete. So rather than taking a snapshot,

274
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.849
look at the different stages of the ontogeny and

275
00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:07.939
there you get a more complete picture. So we

276
00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:11.060
do have quite a few techniques in our hands

277
00:19:11.069 --> 00:19:13.790
that will help us. But I think we're still

278
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.689
quite at the beginning.

279
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.739
Mhm And then there's also this phenomenon of organism,

280
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.540
environment interactions, right? It's not that uh even though

281
00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.359
I if we are considering the environment and how

282
00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:32.989
it influences psychology, it's not that we are just

283
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.344
passive risk chapters of environmental influences. I mean, there's

284
00:19:37.354 --> 00:19:42.484
also a sort of dynamic interplay between the organism

285
00:19:42.494 --> 00:19:45.204
and the environment. And we are, we are like

286
00:19:45.214 --> 00:19:49.125
active agents also playing a role and to some

287
00:19:49.135 --> 00:19:52.795
extent, shaping our own environment, right?

288
00:19:53.939 --> 00:19:57.609
Actually, uh Ricardo, if I may, you've already said

289
00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:00.339
the most important things that to my mind is.

290
00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:04.170
So um there is not only this reciprocal interaction,

291
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:08.130
but it is the organism that influences its own

292
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.910
uh environment to make it uh the organism himself

293
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.449
herself more are adapted to its niche. Um And

294
00:20:18.459 --> 00:20:21.569
especially when we talk about humans and our cognitive

295
00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:25.780
capacities, we are the paradigmatic niche constructors. So we

296
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:30.439
are able to change our environment that it kind

297
00:20:30.449 --> 00:20:33.089
of very well suits us. And that has been

298
00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:39.469
done for, for um our e en en entire

299
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.310
evolutionary trajectory and we've be, and it's getting faster

300
00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:46.369
and faster now that might have bring different problems,

301
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.709
however, but this is something so as you already

302
00:20:49.719 --> 00:20:52.420
said, so you've pointed out the most important uh

303
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:59.040
points already. Um Yeah. So, so, II I think

304
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.079
uh it, it, it maybe one thing is when

305
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:06.410
we take or we look at other um species,

306
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.829
for example, then you can see that there um

307
00:21:12.219 --> 00:21:16.839
the the environment has a plethora of different effects.

308
00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:22.020
So think about temperature, uh dependent sex determination in

309
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:27.920
some organisms or population density dependent sex determination, others

310
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:33.604
or um predator induced um poly is um so

311
00:21:33.614 --> 00:21:37.805
all these things that have very specific outcomes that

312
00:21:37.814 --> 00:21:41.494
are studied in o other species uh in humans,

313
00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:45.314
we've got so many factors that can influence us

314
00:21:45.324 --> 00:21:48.895
uh on top of our very long uh development,

315
00:21:48.905 --> 00:21:54.349
childhood and adolescence development. Um So the, the all

316
00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:58.900
these um selective forces that can shape us um

317
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.109
have a long, long time to, to take its

318
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:02.609
effect.

319
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.520
Uh And I mean, we were talking about genes

320
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.270
just a minute ago and even when it comes

321
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.079
to genetic evolution, I mean, now we have a

322
00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:16.849
broader framework of gene culture co evolution, right? And

323
00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:22.204
it's not just genetic evolution itself occurring, but we

324
00:22:22.214 --> 00:22:26.964
also have culture and culture itself might also influence

325
00:22:26.974 --> 00:22:31.755
how genetic evolution unfolds. And also the other way

326
00:22:31.765 --> 00:22:35.814
around. I mean, genetic evolution might also influence how

327
00:22:35.864 --> 00:22:40.750
I mean, how our culture develops or how attuned

328
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.670
we are to certain aspects in our culture or

329
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.189
the kinds of culture that we have in comparison

330
00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:51.479
to, for example, uh other cultural animals and so

331
00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:54.829
on. So we even there, there's all, there's also

332
00:22:54.839 --> 00:23:00.640
the sort of interplay between genes and the cultural

333
00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:01.810
environment, I

334
00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:05.979
guess. Yep. Yeah, you, you're absolutely right. So there

335
00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:08.640
is of course some classic examples of that what

336
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.609
you've just mentioned like um when um our ancestors

337
00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:20.050
starting to um uh keep animals and uh used

338
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.619
the milk. So we have uh this shift in

339
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.189
our um our our ancestors had this shift in

340
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.800
uh lactose tolerance um in humans. So we have

341
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.930
so many cultural processes that speed up or maybe

342
00:23:35.939 --> 00:23:41.050
even take over evolutionary uh pro natural evolutionary, natural

343
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.920
selection, uh biological evolutionary processes. And a colleague or

344
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:52.739
colleagues of mine have recently shown that um because

345
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:59.579
of medical interventions like um performing cesarean sections, um

346
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:06.069
the evolutionary pressure that um is forced the human

347
00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:10.550
skull of a newborn to remain relatively small because

348
00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.150
it had to fit through the birth channel. This

349
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.219
pressure has been relieved now because of our medical

350
00:24:16.229 --> 00:24:20.910
interventions. So we really, with our cultural evolutionary processes,

351
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.300
we speed up um selection processes.

352
00:24:25.949 --> 00:24:28.550
Mhm A And by the way, I would like

353
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.880
to get into this notion of neuroplasticity because uh

354
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.180
I, I mean, there was a period, I guess

355
00:24:37.189 --> 00:24:40.010
that back in the early two thousands where we

356
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.369
really had a very big hype surrounding neuroplasticity and

357
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.739
that is sort of, but it in that it

358
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.569
was going to explain everything out there. But ii

359
00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:53.719
I mean, now we are perhaps to tune it

360
00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:55.510
down a little bit and, and I would like

361
00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.310
to ask you so, neuroplasticity, what is really the

362
00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:04.689
role it plays in the brain and brain development

363
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.689
and what are its limits?

364
00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:13.530
Mhm OK. Yeah. So, neuroplasticity, this is a um

365
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.630
a very exciting topic. Um So we have actually

366
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.569
did the concept is is more than 100 years

367
00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:24.880
old. Santiago Ra Moni joal was um probably the

368
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.439
first one, was the first one who described it.

369
00:25:27.739 --> 00:25:31.280
But then he kind of because it was not

370
00:25:31.349 --> 00:25:36.260
um well accepted um by his colleagues. So he

371
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:40.270
kind of um reduced it to the assumption that

372
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.709
it only happens very, very early and and then

373
00:25:43.829 --> 00:25:46.489
the brain is no longer available. However, what we

374
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.640
know now is that um there is a huge

375
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:54.290
flexibility and neuroplasticity. So a functional and a structural

376
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.790
neuroplasticity, especially in the human brain. What is, what

377
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.030
is this plasticity? Actually? This is, and this, this

378
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.599
is like a a reorganization um that um helps

379
00:26:05.609 --> 00:26:10.880
our brains to adjust themselves within um an organism's

380
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.579
lifespan and that helps to adjust or to adapt

381
00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:21.060
to the environmental experiences. Now looking at it from

382
00:26:21.069 --> 00:26:25.020
an evil evil. So evolutionary developmental perspective, it's actually

383
00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:29.739
neuroplasticity is just kind of an exploratory mechanism like

384
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:35.339
um we have uh similar forms um in um

385
00:26:35.349 --> 00:26:40.199
in, in other uh organisms. Um So, what does

386
00:26:40.209 --> 00:26:44.239
this mean? So you have um you have me

387
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:51.550
mechanisms that um perform environmental sampling and um so

388
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:58.189
they sample the environment and um get reinforced when

389
00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:03.949
a certain aspect of the phenotype is um has

390
00:27:03.959 --> 00:27:06.930
a positive uh receives a positive stimulus. So a

391
00:27:06.939 --> 00:27:13.410
positive uh feedback. So, um and so, so as

392
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.020
I said, this is actually uh an evil concept

393
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.170
and in the brain you can see it and

394
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.680
it has been studied very thoroughly because it's so,

395
00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:26.640
so obvious that we have this high abundance of

396
00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.869
um neuron uh uh connections. So the synaptic connections

397
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:34.750
in the first. So when we spoke, I, I'm

398
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.286
sticking now with humans in the first two years

399
00:27:38.296 --> 00:27:42.225
of age. So we have this excess of synapses.

400
00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:46.365
And then um what happens then is you get

401
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:51.086
uh pruning that depends on the external stimuli. So

402
00:27:51.095 --> 00:27:54.286
where is that the, the um the exuberant growth

403
00:27:54.296 --> 00:27:58.066
of the synaptic connections? This is largely genetically driven

404
00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:04.791
and also randomly um uh um fostered. But then

405
00:28:04.852 --> 00:28:08.562
what is actually stabilized, which of the synapses remain

406
00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:12.982
and which um get lost or, or um or

407
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:17.852
are eliminated? Very much depends on environmental stimuli coming

408
00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:21.212
up uh coming from the from, from the social

409
00:28:21.222 --> 00:28:25.021
and the physical environment, cultural environment as well. So

410
00:28:25.031 --> 00:28:27.602
you have to use it or lose it principle.

411
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.719
Um So we have some peaks as a childhood.

412
00:28:32.729 --> 00:28:36.099
There is another one in um in adolescence that

413
00:28:36.109 --> 00:28:38.959
that's more of a recent finding. So we have

414
00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:42.729
a two really large peaks of rearrangement in the

415
00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:47.719
brain. Now, this is a huge potential again. Um

416
00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:50.229
There is cases I've written about some of them

417
00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:53.640
in my book cases where the brain really completely

418
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:58.849
reorganizes itself. For example, cases of uh hemispherectomy where

419
00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:02.180
half of the brain. So one hemisphere has been

420
00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:06.780
surgically removed because of uh uh a severe illness.

421
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:12.209
And uh this person almost fully recovered so could

422
00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:14.900
walk again, could speak again. Uh YOU made a

423
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:20.280
college degree. So um the functional half of the

424
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.550
brain took over the missing the function of the

425
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.760
missing half of the brain. So it's a huge

426
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.459
potential. However, and here I agree with you, there

427
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:30.680
has been a huge hype and not everything has

428
00:29:30.689 --> 00:29:33.530
been fulfilled. What, what was hoped for? So there

429
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.160
are limitations and what are the limitations? First of

430
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.430
all, it's age that this probably the biggest thing.

431
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.479
So the younger you are, the more malleable the

432
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:45.239
brain is of course. Um Second thing uh has

433
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.869
also to do with the brain region we're talking

434
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.709
about. So, um what is some regions? Uh YOU

435
00:29:52.719 --> 00:29:57.920
can see that in um in, in uh where,

436
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.030
for example, there is a lot of neurogenesis going

437
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.760
on hippocampus areas, a dag gyros or factory bulb

438
00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:06.699
uh maybe also in the cerebellum, they have a

439
00:30:06.709 --> 00:30:12.079
high um capacity of neuroplasticity. Uh Whereas in other

440
00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:15.920
regions and we see that in patients that suffer

441
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.619
from strokes, um other regions might be much more

442
00:30:20.689 --> 00:30:24.800
uh difficult uh to uh that there is some

443
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.359
new cortic mapping going on. So, so that's another

444
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:33.180
thing, what else? Um THINGS like neurotoxicity. So if

445
00:30:33.189 --> 00:30:36.119
you do damage to your own brain, for example,

446
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.199
by alcohol or your mother did by drinking alcohol

447
00:30:41.209 --> 00:30:44.239
while you were a fetus. So again, there you,

448
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.670
you kind of interfere and that are another really

449
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.709
fascinating thing what has been shown is that um

450
00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:57.569
stress level, the amount of uh cortisol um interfere.

451
00:30:57.579 --> 00:31:02.229
So it is an antagonistic to um neuroplasticity. And

452
00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:04.630
last, but not least, of course, all sorts of

453
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.130
um neurodegenerative diseases are kind of um uh that,

454
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.689
that the inhibit or interfere with neuroplasticity. I'm sure

455
00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:17.069
there's many more other limits. But these, these are

456
00:31:17.079 --> 00:31:18.469
now on the top of my head.

457
00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:25.199
So in the history of neuroscience, there have been

458
00:31:25.209 --> 00:31:29.199
two very dominant ideas. One of them perhaps is

459
00:31:29.209 --> 00:31:32.939
more recent is more from, I guess the seventies

460
00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:36.069
eighties somewhere like that. But I mean, the first

461
00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:39.729
one is localization is that is the idea that

462
00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:42.949
there would be a 1 to 1 mapping of

463
00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:49.239
brain areas and particular functional traits, including character traits

464
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.119
that I think is the, the one are the

465
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.630
ones that we are mostly interested in here because

466
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.290
we are talking about uh human psychology and uh

467
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.569
people's uh traits and so on. Uh I I

468
00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:07.369
mean, and then the other one is modularity of

469
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.920
mind slash brain. And perhaps to some extent they

470
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.660
might be, I guess we could say a little

471
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.189
bit related because if we can, if we can

472
00:32:18.199 --> 00:32:22.859
find that certain functions are exclusive to certain particular

473
00:32:22.869 --> 00:32:27.000
brain areas, then the idea of modularity is just

474
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.444
saying that OK, so we have different modules across

475
00:32:30.454 --> 00:32:35.204
the brain that have evolved separately to serve certain

476
00:32:35.255 --> 00:32:39.435
functions. Perhaps the main argument here would be to

477
00:32:39.444 --> 00:32:45.734
serve certain evolved functions related to survival, reproduction and

478
00:32:45.744 --> 00:32:48.910
so on it. I I mean, how do you

479
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.099
look at, at these ideas? Do you think that

480
00:32:51.109 --> 00:32:55.819
they are still very dominant in neuroscience? Is there

481
00:32:55.829 --> 00:33:00.420
still some support to them or not so much?

482
00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:05.290
Well, that's certainly interesting because um first of all,

483
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.500
let me be a little bit provocative. Um BECAUSE

484
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:14.260
IIIM, my argument is that the localization list view

485
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.150
um is actually uh rooted in the legacy of

486
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.869
phrenology. I don't know if you can see. Um

487
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.630
Y yes, I, I was actually already noticing

488
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.770
it. So, so um of course, this is just

489
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.630
provocative. Um And um we've come a long way

490
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.130
since. Um SO this still this, this thinking of

491
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:44.250
that you have different um areas that are um

492
00:33:44.699 --> 00:33:50.589
distinct, um different traits can be mapped to very

493
00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:55.140
um um distinct brain areas. Um And that even

494
00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.290
goes for character trait, personality traits. So this is

495
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.030
um this is something that, that uh is to

496
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.469
my mind largely overblown. However, however, uh when we

497
00:34:09.478 --> 00:34:12.090
look at the gross anatomy of the brain, then

498
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.290
the localization list view is not wrong, right? Because

499
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.860
I mean, we know from uh from studies uh

500
00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.699
that individual case studies um like that there is

501
00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:32.379
a relatively high reliability, not 100% never, but some

502
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:37.080
areas that is so, so otherwise this whole brain

503
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.270
maps of the brain atlas that that's now has

504
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.672
been established by the huge flagship ship EU project

505
00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:48.652
wouldn't make sense. So there is to a good

506
00:34:48.663 --> 00:34:52.112
degree there is localization, especially when we talk about

507
00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:56.032
the soma motor cortex or somatosensory cortex and so

508
00:34:56.042 --> 00:34:58.812
on that, like defined by Wilder Penfield. So there

509
00:34:58.822 --> 00:35:03.183
is um I I'm not disputing that however, an

510
00:35:03.193 --> 00:35:08.156
ex extreme localization list uh view of functions is

511
00:35:08.166 --> 00:35:11.375
almost certainly wrong because this would go completely against

512
00:35:11.385 --> 00:35:15.726
neuroplasticity. And actually, including while the Penfield already like

513
00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:18.666
more than uh I don't know, 70 years ago,

514
00:35:18.676 --> 00:35:21.795
he already saw that there are some overlapping zones

515
00:35:21.805 --> 00:35:24.686
and this is not like a clear cut module

516
00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:29.530
now. Um And another thing that would also kind

517
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.110
of argue against it, not only the neuroplastic um

518
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.949
uh uh argument, I've just broadened, which we touched

519
00:35:37.959 --> 00:35:42.580
upon previously. Also, um you can have brain damage

520
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.510
in different, in, in different patients at the same

521
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.530
position and they have very different symptoms. So also

522
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.449
that would argue against it. Now, um what makes

523
00:35:55.459 --> 00:36:00.310
the real big difference is uh of course, the

524
00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:06.030
um micro anatomy, how the synaptic connections are then

525
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.120
established as we've already seen uh in terms of

526
00:36:09.129 --> 00:36:11.530
dis use it or lose it. Now, in answer

527
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.290
to your question, how does it relate to brain

528
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.199
modules? Well, one thing that comes to my mind

529
00:36:20.209 --> 00:36:26.709
is that in, in case of um evolutionary psychology

530
00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:30.350
and um and this uh view of, of um

531
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.709
very clear cut uh brain modules, then there's always

532
00:36:34.719 --> 00:36:38.510
this debate that a lot of it is innate,

533
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.679
if not all you develop. Um Of course, you

534
00:36:42.689 --> 00:36:44.949
develop, you're not born with it, you develop it.

535
00:36:44.959 --> 00:36:47.705
But if you develop it, that comes due to

536
00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:50.165
do some input from the environment, but it's still

537
00:36:50.175 --> 00:36:53.165
always the module will be uh roughly at the

538
00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:56.004
same time. Or however, there is also a different

539
00:36:56.044 --> 00:37:00.364
uh interpretation. Um COMING from the sparseness concept, it

540
00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:04.445
might not even be anatomically exactly the same position.

541
00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:07.125
But yet you have like a sparse network that

542
00:37:07.135 --> 00:37:10.399
always kind of gives you a module. Now, this

543
00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:13.820
is much more difficult to disprove um what I

544
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.820
can as to my mind from, from uh w

545
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:23.260
what WW what uh I I see um coming

546
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:28.449
from the Neurosciences is that yes, there is modularity.

547
00:37:28.459 --> 00:37:32.620
Yes, gross anatomy is relatively reliable. You can do

548
00:37:32.629 --> 00:37:37.550
these brain maps. Um However, this massive modularity hypothesis

549
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.270
that with these highly specialized models like uh Swiss

550
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.830
army knife that is to my mind uh has

551
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.520
the most neuroscientists have moved away from that. So,

552
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.120
yeah, that, that's my take on that.

553
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:56.340
Uh Also uh one of the reasons why I

554
00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.540
wanted to ask you about that actually. And you

555
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:04.389
mentioned evolutionary psychology there and yes, massive modularity of

556
00:38:04.399 --> 00:38:07.439
the human mind is and a big idea in

557
00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:12.110
evolutionary psychology, specifically, not, not exclusively, I guess, but

558
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.340
yes, specifically there uh it, but since we talked

559
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:19.520
about genes at the beginning of our conversation, sometimes

560
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.139
it seems to me that uh not just the

561
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:27.120
modularity of mind idea, but also some of these

562
00:38:27.129 --> 00:38:33.360
localization is thinking as some parallels with gene centric

563
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:35.850
views of psychology in the way, in a way

564
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.560
that I mean, sometimes you hear evolutionary psychologists, for

565
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:46.459
example, claim that they uh the neonate brain sort

566
00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:52.659
of harbors innate cognitive modules that come equipped with

567
00:38:52.669 --> 00:38:57.979
contents that are specified in the genetic makeup. I

568
00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:02.030
mean, something along those lines, right? And so uh

569
00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.810
we would have ii I think that the term,

570
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.469
the correct term here would be information processing mechanisms

571
00:39:11.479 --> 00:39:16.889
that are innate and that are again specified in

572
00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:20.510
the genetic makeup. And uh and that are associated

573
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.919
with these or that different kind of brain or

574
00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:27.810
mind module. So, uh I, I guess that this

575
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.879
is the idea but, but basically, what I'm asking

576
00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.739
you here is if you agree that uh this

577
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:39.439
sort of modularity localization is idea sometimes links to

578
00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:42.770
gene centric views of human psychology.

579
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.840
Definitely, I, I very much appreciate this point um

580
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.810
with that, that you highlight that actually, I, I

581
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.810
see it in a very similar light. So um

582
00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:01.919
there is this kind of idea of um innateness

583
00:40:01.979 --> 00:40:04.209
that has a little bit of a touch of

584
00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:09.360
prema formation is so that you have already all

585
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.050
the information is already there and you just need

586
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.330
to unfold it, you know, but it, it is

587
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.370
already there. And um II I think uh I

588
00:40:19.379 --> 00:40:22.179
mean, the the truth is always probably somewhere in

589
00:40:22.189 --> 00:40:25.260
the middle, it's not completely wrong. Of course, I

590
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.929
mean, there is good evidence also for some of

591
00:40:27.939 --> 00:40:32.330
these claims. However, as I see, it is um

592
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:39.459
you, you have these predispositions coming from genes um

593
00:40:40.129 --> 00:40:43.800
and they give uh some kind of a kickstart,

594
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:48.479
they give you uh a guiding um expression and

595
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:53.959
then it is the development. So uh that uh

596
00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:57.590
that, so that or let me say, say like

597
00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.280
this, that um you have a predisposition and that

598
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:06.080
provides then a substrate for the developmental processes to

599
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.530
operate. So, and I think this is where it

600
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.979
comes from. It is not completely wrong. But um

601
00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:14.176
yeah, and, and I agree on the parallel which

602
00:41:14.186 --> 00:41:16.895
you pointed out. So II, I think yes, this

603
00:41:16.906 --> 00:41:20.946
innateness concept has smacks very much of pre formation

604
00:41:20.976 --> 00:41:21.375
is,

605
00:41:22.585 --> 00:41:24.085
yeah. And I, and I mean, I don't know

606
00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:27.006
if you agree with this point specifically, but I

607
00:41:27.016 --> 00:41:31.135
guess that you use the word predisposition there instead

608
00:41:31.145 --> 00:41:34.375
of thinking about in terms of innateness, I guess.

609
00:41:34.385 --> 00:41:37.456
And I, I would imagine that, yeah, there's, I

610
00:41:37.466 --> 00:41:42.031
think good evidence that perhaps we are born with

611
00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:47.231
some predispositions to, for example, pay attention to certain

612
00:41:47.602 --> 00:41:52.241
information in our environment, particularly the social environment. For

613
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:55.691
example, I don't know, look at people's faces and

614
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:59.031
try to gather information from them. And perhaps some

615
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:05.172
aspects of language might also be predisposition and stuff

616
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:09.439
like that. Uh But then perhaps the idea that's

617
00:42:09.449 --> 00:42:15.280
wrong here is to think that uh those predispositions

618
00:42:15.459 --> 00:42:21.879
are like uh fixed and the underlying informational processing,

619
00:42:21.889 --> 00:42:27.080
mech information processing mechanisms cannot be changed at all

620
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:31.939
or are impermeable to culture and to all kinds

621
00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:35.955
of environment inputs. I mean, does this ring through

622
00:42:35.965 --> 00:42:36.604
or?

623
00:42:36.625 --> 00:42:39.844
Yeah, that definitely. So you you touched upon a

624
00:42:39.854 --> 00:42:43.735
really, really important point here because what's completely left

625
00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:49.044
out in the whole debate um about modernity is

626
00:42:49.054 --> 00:42:53.264
um the the concept of the idea of acceptation

627
00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.830
and especially the human mind with all our cultural

628
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.449
evolution, we have um a lot of what, what

629
00:43:01.459 --> 00:43:05.750
our brain does, what the human mind does is

630
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.419
falls in the domain of acceptation. So what is

631
00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:15.409
that? So we have certain brain regions maybe um

632
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:21.520
that have evolved for some specific adapt adaptive purposes.

633
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.129
But then they have been report purposed hijacked. You

634
00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:32.689
mentioned the example of um attention focusing, visually focusing.

635
00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:35.459
Um I think social stimuli and so on. Now,

636
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:39.729
obviously, our visual senses are very good. Now, um

637
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.040
our culture has evolved to uh that we, we

638
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.429
use writing and would be we're able to, to

639
00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:53.610
read and write. So most certainly don't have an

640
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:59.080
innate mo module for learning to read. So this

641
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.899
is an acceptation. So this was most likely uh

642
00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:06.850
a region that has been adapted to uh uh

643
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:13.179
uh uh um pattern recognition, pattern completion and that

644
00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:16.959
has then been used for different purpose for reading.

645
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.929
Yeah. And that doesn't sit well with evolutionary uh

646
00:44:20.939 --> 00:44:25.080
with, with um the massive modernity hypothesis. Definitely.

647
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.239
Mhm And so one topic that I would like

648
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.409
to get into now is of course, when it

649
00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:35.419
comes to human psychology, at least in our modern

650
00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:41.459
societies, uh we also have a medical approach to

651
00:44:41.469 --> 00:44:44.939
it and we, and we use terms like uh

652
00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:51.919
normal development, normal psychology. We, we, we, we use

653
00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:57.340
terms like mental disorder, mental condition and a mental

654
00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:00.530
disease and something and stuff like that. So, uh

655
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.540
do, do you think, I mean, when it comes

656
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:09.280
to thinking about what normal might mean in the

657
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:14.560
context of uh developmental psychology, what do you think

658
00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.699
are perhaps some of the issues with that, with,

659
00:45:17.709 --> 00:45:24.169
with thinking that there's a normal way for human

660
00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:28.639
psychology to develop. And if uh a person, for

661
00:45:28.649 --> 00:45:33.719
example, somewhat deviates from that normal pathway, then there

662
00:45:33.729 --> 00:45:36.639
must be something wrong with them.

663
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.510
Yeah, this is again, a very, very important question

664
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.090
and topic. You, you, you, you, you're uh pointing

665
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.570
out. So um to my mind and I've, I've

666
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:56.110
written uh about it. Um THIS idea of normal

667
00:45:56.159 --> 00:46:00.709
has its roots in mechanistic thinking. So we see

668
00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:04.649
and that again, go goes back, I always kind

669
00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:06.550
of uh see a little bit of the historical

670
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.340
components. Yeah. Uh THAT goes back even to, to

671
00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:14.830
Rene de K and um who saw the body

672
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.500
as, as like the mindless machine, you know, and

673
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.800
um in this view, we have a view, uh

674
00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:27.810
we have a conception of a healthy body like

675
00:46:27.909 --> 00:46:32.030
a machine that runs error free. This is not

676
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.550
only a huge simplification, let alone that, but it

677
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:42.290
has also other consequences. First of all, um it

678
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.870
assumes that there is something that is fixable, there

679
00:46:46.879 --> 00:46:50.219
is something that must be a standard uh uh

680
00:46:50.229 --> 00:46:54.010
a way how it should work, um an optimal

681
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.530
way how it should work. And if we fix

682
00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.280
that, just, you know, turn on this um screw

683
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.949
or, or, or change this little button, then we

684
00:47:03.959 --> 00:47:06.429
can um we can all of a sudden uh

685
00:47:06.439 --> 00:47:10.030
put the person back into being normal again, re

686
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.179
establishing normalcy. That has a lot to do. Also

687
00:47:14.189 --> 00:47:19.889
with how the current um psychopharmacology, uh pharmacology in

688
00:47:19.899 --> 00:47:23.649
general looks at the brain, you know that there's

689
00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:28.189
something out of balance, you change something, you turn

690
00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:30.679
some wheel and all of a sudden you imbalance

691
00:47:30.689 --> 00:47:35.290
against this is this has problematic consequences. It also

692
00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.209
has societal consequences. We might want to speak about

693
00:47:38.219 --> 00:47:42.310
that. And last, but not least is it makes

694
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.810
us really overconfident because we can capture the complexity

695
00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.810
of a machine. So we might think, oh yeah,

696
00:47:50.149 --> 00:47:53.250
we might be able, you know, to have pumps

697
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.350
like pumps blood like an old pump. So we

698
00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.500
must be able to fix that and we completely

699
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:05.860
neglect um these multi scale properties and systemic properties

700
00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:09.425
um which might, you know, have even and I'm

701
00:48:09.435 --> 00:48:12.584
touching on a very hot topic here, which might

702
00:48:12.594 --> 00:48:14.354
not be true, but we might even be talking

703
00:48:14.364 --> 00:48:18.985
about bottom up and top down causation. So, so

704
00:48:18.995 --> 00:48:22.044
um all these things which you will never find

705
00:48:22.054 --> 00:48:22.665
in a machine.

706
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.560
So, uh I mean, about this medical context and

707
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.820
how we think about psychopathology, there are many things

708
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:33.899
we could talk about here. I mean, just when

709
00:48:33.909 --> 00:48:37.879
it comes to simple classification and the DS M

710
00:48:37.889 --> 00:48:41.699
for example, um in 2022 I had an entire

711
00:48:41.709 --> 00:48:45.020
interview with Doctor Ellen Oritz and we got into

712
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.300
the huge mess that is the history of the

713
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:54.365
DS M. The classification of mental disorders changed drastically

714
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:58.266
over the decades for reasons that have sometimes very

715
00:48:58.275 --> 00:49:00.775
little to do with science. So that's already a

716
00:49:00.785 --> 00:49:03.516
problem in and of itself. But uh I would

717
00:49:03.525 --> 00:49:06.575
like to ask you about the specific, very interesting

718
00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:08.426
thing that I read about in your book that

719
00:49:08.436 --> 00:49:12.506
is Looping Effects. And I'm, I'm, and I'm going

720
00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:17.132
to uh quote you here. This is basically how

721
00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:23.491
the verbal discourse about certain psychopathological or psychological phenomena

722
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:28.931
impacts on how this very phenomenon is framed theorized

723
00:49:28.941 --> 00:49:32.852
experience and treated. So, I mean, it seems that

724
00:49:32.862 --> 00:49:39.491
also the way we uh theorize and classify disorders

725
00:49:39.501 --> 00:49:45.139
and study them itself might have an effect on

726
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:49.760
how we think about them and then reinforce, I

727
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:54.540
guess, I guess, to some extent uh their own

728
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.899
uh existence.

729
00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:01.830
Yep. So, yeah, you, you, you uh summarized it

730
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.590
very nicely. The concept actually comes from Ian hacking.

731
00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:10.810
And um this is uh I think it's important

732
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.739
because it is um a uh a way of

733
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:20.719
looking at um pathologies, especially psychopathologies uh in a

734
00:50:20.729 --> 00:50:24.139
way that may be able to bridge the normative

735
00:50:24.149 --> 00:50:28.959
and the naturalist conceptions. So, um what's at stake

736
00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:31.570
here? So if this is true, if this loop

737
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:37.750
looping uh effects exist, um and we classify doctors,

738
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.629
psychologists, psychiatrists classify people in a certain way, then

739
00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:46.879
people may conform to the way how this pathology

740
00:50:46.889 --> 00:50:50.629
is described. So it opens up a space that

741
00:50:50.639 --> 00:50:55.270
they can um express symptoms in a socially accepted

742
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.469
way. And at the same time, it has this

743
00:50:58.479 --> 00:51:04.189
kind of um components that it might lead to

744
00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:07.979
um a self fulfilling prophecy because this is the

745
00:51:07.989 --> 00:51:10.669
way how you expect to behave or the symptoms

746
00:51:10.679 --> 00:51:14.449
you expect to um to, to express. So, yeah,

747
00:51:14.459 --> 00:51:18.209
this is um I found it interesting in uh

748
00:51:18.219 --> 00:51:23.629
relation to uh studies how Children when they were

749
00:51:23.639 --> 00:51:29.250
maltreated again over history. What happened? Uh It gives

750
00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:36.320
um it, it almost uh absorbs uh uh the

751
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.340
parents from their responsibilities when you look at a

752
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.649
pathology and then you will say, yeah, but um

753
00:51:43.659 --> 00:51:46.090
can't do anything about it. And this is how

754
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.790
the the child is like this and the child

755
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.830
will act out in this way. So um Ian

756
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.790
hacking actually used a sync uh a DH D

757
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.580
as a modern day, a contemporary example of the

758
00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:06.729
looping effect. So, you know, uh and interestingly um

759
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.929
might be very much depending on, on cultural inputs,

760
00:52:11.939 --> 00:52:14.949
what do you expect from how a person behaves?

761
00:52:14.959 --> 00:52:19.149
And another example is of course, uh hysteria that,

762
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:24.570
that um disappeared in fro from, from uh from

763
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:28.520
the, the DS M for example. Um So, so

764
00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.629
yeah, I, I think um this looping effect has

765
00:52:31.639 --> 00:52:36.159
a lot of potential to um explain why some

766
00:52:36.169 --> 00:52:41.110
of the pathologies um come and go and why

767
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.500
some of these pathologies express symptoms of patients with

768
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.560
these pathologies express certain symptoms at a certain given

769
00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:53.030
time in history and then they don't anymore. So

770
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.389
it has something to do with the social acceptance.

771
00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:01.620
A and also there are very particular examples, some

772
00:53:01.629 --> 00:53:06.350
of their very unfortunate historical examples like the case

773
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:12.600
of homosexuality, right? Which in not very long ago,

774
00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:17.159
it was considered a mental disorder. And I mean,

775
00:53:17.169 --> 00:53:22.459
with scientific progress and with people who were themselves

776
00:53:22.489 --> 00:53:27.100
almost sexual, expressing their own views and social movements

777
00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:29.330
and all of that, I mean, it has been

778
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:35.439
fortunately normalized across many societies, not everywhere, unfortunately, but

779
00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:40.030
across many societies and it's no longer considered the

780
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.639
medical condition. But I I mean, it, it, that's,

781
00:53:44.649 --> 00:53:48.729
that's I guess a very clear example of something

782
00:53:48.739 --> 00:53:55.090
that was medicalized, considered an anomaly just on a

783
00:53:55.250 --> 00:54:01.310
cultural normative and moral grounds, basically because people uh

784
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:05.139
to put it in the simplest terms, possible, didn't

785
00:54:05.149 --> 00:54:07.239
like that kind of behavior.

786
00:54:07.639 --> 00:54:11.040
Right. Exactly. So th this is here, you, you

787
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:14.189
pointed out this is uh there was this very,

788
00:54:14.199 --> 00:54:19.229
very strong normative component to it and um that

789
00:54:19.239 --> 00:54:24.070
there is always a walk on the tightrope um

790
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:31.239
about um s to patho pathologize symptoms versus to

791
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.610
help people. So obviously, you want to uh help

792
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.870
people. Uh But in some cases, um there is

793
00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:43.070
no, no help required as in case of homosexuality,

794
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.409
this is was a purely normative um uh decision.

795
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:53.580
And uh here uh you pathologize um a normal

796
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:57.310
variation within the human population. Mhm

797
00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:00.830
Yeah. A and so, uh I, I mean, at

798
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.080
a certain point there, you also mentioned when we

799
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:07.620
were talking about how we think about normalcy, uh

800
00:55:07.629 --> 00:55:12.330
the fact that uh nowadays it seems that we

801
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:18.000
are uh like bio biologs. I mean, relying much

802
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:21.870
on the biological aspect of things when thinking about

803
00:55:21.879 --> 00:55:26.270
certain disorders. I mean, trying to find specific genes,

804
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.169
specific brain regions that might be malfunctioning and that

805
00:55:31.179 --> 00:55:36.719
would explain, I don't know, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and

806
00:55:36.729 --> 00:55:40.219
all of that. But I, I mean, shouldn't we

807
00:55:40.229 --> 00:55:46.739
have moved already past the simple biological or re

808
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:51.379
reductionist way of looking at things? I mean, shouldn't

809
00:55:51.389 --> 00:55:54.659
uh don't we have at this time already a

810
00:55:54.669 --> 00:56:01.419
bio psychosocial model of, of human psychology and also

811
00:56:01.429 --> 00:56:06.100
I guess adding to that uh an individual's own

812
00:56:06.419 --> 00:56:08.939
history to consider.

813
00:56:09.659 --> 00:56:13.500
Yeah. Um I see your point. However, what is

814
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:18.840
extremely tempting about this. Um And I'm uh uh

815
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.679
I, I also think it's, it's largely reductionist, but

816
00:56:22.689 --> 00:56:25.629
it does not necessarily have to be reductionist if,

817
00:56:25.639 --> 00:56:30.080
if you stay looking just at the biological parameters.

818
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.800
But the exciting and interesting thing about doing that

819
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:39.239
and focusing on the biological parameters is that the

820
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.149
um they are quantifiable, they are measurable. And this

821
00:56:43.159 --> 00:56:47.919
is something that conveys objectivity. This is much easier

822
00:56:47.929 --> 00:56:54.050
to sell to work with than our messy environments

823
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.959
where you were, where you take other theories that

824
00:56:57.969 --> 00:57:03.639
draw from seemingly soft sciences that have qualitative approaches

825
00:57:03.649 --> 00:57:06.080
and so on. So this is what we still,

826
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.149
in some cases, rely on some on, on uh

827
00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:16.850
Christopher Bo's biostatistical theory. Although especially with psychopathologies, there

828
00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:21.330
is hardly any um objective parameter that we can

829
00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:27.110
specify um in terms of what is normal in

830
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.330
a given uh population versus where is, where is

831
00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.669
a deviation that leads to these and uh those

832
00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:38.129
uh symptoms of uh pathologies. So I, I think

833
00:57:38.139 --> 00:57:41.629
that the appeal is simply because it's measurable and

834
00:57:41.639 --> 00:57:45.229
we have techniques that can be exploited for that.

835
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:45.780
Yeah.

836
00:57:46.459 --> 00:57:49.639
Mhm. Uh So do you think that when it

837
00:57:49.649 --> 00:57:56.110
comes to understanding how psychological traits work, how they

838
00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:01.979
develop through time that perhaps a framework like dynamical

839
00:58:01.989 --> 00:58:08.370
systems theory would apply here and would be perhaps

840
00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:14.060
a more uh closer to the reality of human

841
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:19.790
psychology than some other, let's say reductionist views out

842
00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.330
there, like trying to biolog or reduce everything to

843
00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:33.209
simple biological factors like genes, hormones, neurotransmitters, brain networks

844
00:58:33.219 --> 00:58:34.729
and, and stuff like that.

845
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.419
Mhm. Yep. That's a very good point. Um And

846
00:58:38.429 --> 00:58:40.939
again, I agree. Um So I think we're thinking

847
00:58:40.949 --> 00:58:45.479
along similar lines. Um We don't, we, we don't

848
00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:48.729
have a strong controversy yet. So II, I do

849
00:58:48.739 --> 00:58:52.330
agree. Um I think actually it would be very

850
00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:57.870
helpful to shift towards um complex system theory because

851
00:58:57.879 --> 00:59:03.110
with all the reductionist approaches, we're completely letting uh

852
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:08.350
uh setting aside um the relations among these different

853
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:14.429
complexes and components in the complex and disregard sort

854
00:59:14.439 --> 00:59:18.729
of systemic qualities. And um yeah, so this is,

855
00:59:18.739 --> 00:59:24.239
this is a really important point. Um However, um

856
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:28.209
there, these are, you know, you, you, you harvest

857
00:59:28.219 --> 00:59:33.989
usually the low hanging fruits first. So I think

858
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.010
we're getting there, the field is moving. But um

859
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.479
there is still i it's funding is still, there

860
00:59:42.489 --> 00:59:44.570
is still a lot of funding and, and still

861
00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.620
a lot of money in uh using the more

862
00:59:48.629 --> 00:59:52.090
traditional approaches and some of them still may have

863
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:57.270
merits. Um Yeah, but, but I think the next

864
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.969
big lipo step has to be to look uh

865
00:59:59.979 --> 01:00:02.439
look at the organism from a systemic view point

866
01:00:02.449 --> 01:00:03.310
of view. I agree.

867
01:00:04.159 --> 01:00:06.320
And of course, I guess that in this case,

868
01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.939
this is not at all to say that uh

869
01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:13.870
things like genes or hormones or neurotransmitters do not

870
01:00:13.879 --> 01:00:16.709
matter at all. I mean, they, they play, they

871
01:00:16.719 --> 01:00:19.850
certainly play their role. It's just the fact that

872
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.060
perhaps we have to think about our psychology as

873
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:28.219
more of a dynamic system and the rates as

874
01:00:28.229 --> 01:00:33.459
not really uh fixed things that uh that uh

875
01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:37.489
change and fluctuate over time in this or that

876
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.459
direction uh and the same, I guess would apply

877
01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:43.850
to mental disorders.

878
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.449
Right. Yeah, I agree. And just um going back

879
01:00:48.459 --> 01:00:52.449
to something I said earlier, um with respect to

880
01:00:52.459 --> 01:00:57.669
the expose on when we look at um genome

881
01:00:57.679 --> 01:01:01.689
wide association studies related to the expos on to

882
01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:06.250
expos studies, then it would be really important to

883
01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:10.050
look at all the developmental components that are involved

884
01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.209
and the whole trajectory of the development. So, uh

885
01:01:13.219 --> 01:01:19.070
as you rightly said, um it's not uh you

886
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.919
know, it's not fix, but um Conran Waddington called

887
01:01:24.929 --> 01:01:28.120
it homo races. So, rather than having um the

888
01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:31.750
concept of just homeostasis with a set point where

889
01:01:31.919 --> 01:01:34.110
you, where the organism goes back to a set,

890
01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:39.159
it is the, the trajectory that is followed, not

891
01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.840
an individual set point.

892
01:01:41.459 --> 01:01:45.969
Conrad Weddington uh is the one also related to

893
01:01:45.979 --> 01:01:48.919
the idea of the epigenetic landscape.

894
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.209
Absolutely. Right.

895
01:01:51.169 --> 01:01:56.129
Yeah. And so uh another thing that perhaps nowadays

896
01:01:56.139 --> 01:01:59.729
upsets many people, but I guess that we should

897
01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:03.889
also mention this when it comes to environment and

898
01:02:03.899 --> 01:02:08.090
social relations. Isn't it also important to consider here?

899
01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:15.060
Things like socio-economic structures, systemic discrimination based on gender,

900
01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:18.760
race or any other kind of social category and

901
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:24.560
other sorts of social uh categories, identities and related

902
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.239
factors.

903
01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:30.889
But yeah, um very, very good point. Um So

904
01:02:31.679 --> 01:02:35.340
talking about socio-economic structures, I think there has already

905
01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:40.340
been quite some good work done. And um there

906
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.270
is, there is uh animal model studies but also

907
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.129
correlation studies in humans where uh it has been

908
01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:53.169
shown that um I think Michael Meany, for example,

909
01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:55.719
uh did, did something in this direction and other

910
01:02:55.729 --> 01:03:01.389
colleagues uh also um looked at um what was

911
01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:07.600
the um what's the effect of um growing up

912
01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:11.629
in poverty? And it has been shown that the,

913
01:03:11.639 --> 01:03:15.090
the level of uh some components of the uh

914
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.370
stress axis or stress response axis, like cortisol and

915
01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:24.820
like ac th they are increased very early already

916
01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.415
in, in uh you could see a difference um

917
01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.735
already in Children of the age of six years

918
01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:35.195
and by the age of 10 years, they have

919
01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:39.854
um the, the, the the le level of cortisol

920
01:03:39.864 --> 01:03:42.725
has already doubled. So I mean, this is really

921
01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:48.834
significant. Um Of course, we might discuss whether this

922
01:03:48.844 --> 01:03:50.814
is just reductionist, but this, in any case, it

923
01:03:50.824 --> 01:03:54.949
is a good indicator. Now, um the other points

924
01:03:54.959 --> 01:04:00.250
you mentioned, of course, they are very uh important.

925
01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:04.770
Like looking at systemic discrimination. We know that um

926
01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.469
stress due to hierarchy in other animals um can

927
01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:13.195
be measured by means of cortisol levels. For example,

928
01:04:13.385 --> 01:04:18.324
discrimination due to gender race or other social categories

929
01:04:18.334 --> 01:04:21.435
probably will give the same result. I haven't looked

930
01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:23.995
into that. But I think here at the beginning

931
01:04:24.004 --> 01:04:27.834
of some big societal questions and um this, I

932
01:04:27.844 --> 01:04:31.725
think the scientific journey will eventually take us exactly

933
01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:32.475
in this direction.

934
01:04:32.989 --> 01:04:37.310
Mhm No, a actually that, that bit about hierarchy

935
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.709
and cortisol levels. It reminded me of studies that

936
01:04:40.719 --> 01:04:45.070
Dr Robert Sapolsky did with baboons in baboon societies

937
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.290
where apparently the low, the lower ranking baboons had

938
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.350
higher levels of cortisol, higher levels of stress and

939
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.010
that affected the physiology in many different ways. And

940
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.770
then it talks about an episode where I don't

941
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.760
know exactly why, but for some reason, the higher

942
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:08.479
ranking baboons were wiped out and then suddenly the

943
01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:11.750
cortisol levels for the others went down and the

944
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.179
society was more peaceful, at least for a while.

945
01:05:15.189 --> 01:05:18.169
So uh yeah, I guess that's uh an example

946
01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:18.580
of that.

947
01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.399
And if you think of what uh cortisol does

948
01:05:22.409 --> 01:05:25.070
not only to your organs, so to somatic organs,

949
01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.219
but also to your brain that it interferes. I

950
01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:32.250
already said that right, uh it interferes with neuroplasticity.

951
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:36.570
It uh seemingly has an effect on um the

952
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:41.449
size of the hippocampus. Um Regina Sullivan's lab showed

953
01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:44.899
that stress components when elevated, had an effect on

954
01:05:44.909 --> 01:05:47.604
the maturation of the Amygdala, so of the Fear

955
01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.584
Center. So this is a bit of a uh

956
01:05:49.705 --> 01:05:53.705
pop science term. But you know, um the the

957
01:05:53.715 --> 01:05:56.314
the the the the uh that the the activation

958
01:05:56.324 --> 01:05:59.364
of the Amygdala sets in earlier, which has an

959
01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:03.354
effect on what type of learning happens. So a

960
01:06:03.364 --> 01:06:06.935
shift from preferential to aversion learning. So this has

961
01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:10.905
immense consequences just by looking at a factor like

962
01:06:10.915 --> 01:06:12.885
socio-economic sta status.

963
01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:19.820
So going back to what normal means and the

964
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:24.139
implications it has for how we think about traits,

965
01:06:24.149 --> 01:06:29.050
um disorders and so on. How should we think

966
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.790
about normal then? I mean, because I guess that

967
01:06:33.129 --> 01:06:37.090
if we are being realistic here, I mean, there

968
01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:41.389
will always be norms in human societies, right? And

969
01:06:41.399 --> 01:06:44.770
there are things that we will always consider normal

970
01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:50.389
or abnormal. But from a scientific perspective, do you

971
01:06:50.399 --> 01:06:55.729
think that we should still think about normal in

972
01:06:55.739 --> 01:06:58.409
any meaningful way or not?

973
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:04.580
Yeah, that's a difficult question. So um uh maybe

974
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:06.850
let me answer this from a more practical point

975
01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.800
of view. So um there is this, this, this

976
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:16.939
idea of uh normalcy is kind of dictated or

977
01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:22.429
established by the reference group that give, that is

978
01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:26.570
like the bigger part of the the society does

979
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.399
not even have to be. But uh say, say

980
01:07:29.409 --> 01:07:33.199
this, if, if we, if we follow a bio

981
01:07:33.729 --> 01:07:37.459
static biostatistical approach in the sense of Christopher Bush,

982
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:41.070
so we have this uh this reference group and

983
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.459
this reference group kind of defines normals. It is

984
01:07:44.479 --> 01:07:48.100
the current situation. Now, what also happens if we,

985
01:07:48.699 --> 01:07:51.760
if we connect it back to what uh we've

986
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:55.659
discussed earlier about niche construction, it will also be

987
01:07:55.669 --> 01:07:58.590
this kind of dominant group in within the population

988
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.189
that shaped the niche. This is the group that

989
01:08:02.199 --> 01:08:06.110
determine um what sort of environment we will all

990
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.479
be living in. Now, uh in some cases, it

991
01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:13.449
has been shown that when there is a variation

992
01:08:13.459 --> 01:08:17.689
in traits, like maybe in high functional autistic people,

993
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.470
like in uh uh uh in, in uh high

994
01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:28.240
functional uh asper people that they have immensely contributed

995
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:33.259
to society, to success of say um the virtual

996
01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:37.758
environment and so on. Um This is because they

997
01:08:37.769 --> 01:08:41.618
could pick their niche that seemingly fitted them and

998
01:08:41.627 --> 01:08:46.469
what they seemingly work well adapted to. Ideally, it

999
01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:51.899
would be these people who are neurodivergent, so not

1000
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:57.330
neurotypical, but you know, uh uh that, that could

1001
01:08:57.339 --> 01:09:01.339
contribute in saying or in shaping the niche because

1002
01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:04.750
they are, they would be better adapted then and

1003
01:09:04.759 --> 01:09:07.529
it would be, yeah, it would be much better

1004
01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.649
uh for them to um to function and to

1005
01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.729
contribute to society. Uh I know this is a

1006
01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.509
huge challenge and in some cases with severe psychopathologies,

1007
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.990
it might never work. Um But yeah, so, so

1008
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.669
this is, this is one of the answers in

1009
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.629
I I in practical terms. Uh THE other answer

1010
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.609
and coming a little bit more from the conceptual

1011
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:37.828
side now is um so defining uh um what's

1012
01:09:37.837 --> 01:09:42.349
normal um has got, I already said that it's

1013
01:09:42.358 --> 01:09:48.219
normative as well as this naturalistic uh component. Now,

1014
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:53.430
um if we want to uh combine these two,

1015
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:59.569
then this means that um we will have to

1016
01:09:59.649 --> 01:10:04.609
uh have a real um different way of looking

1017
01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:08.580
um at, at, at uh at variability, at genetic

1018
01:10:08.589 --> 01:10:13.209
variability at um behavioral variability. And I'm not sure

1019
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.569
where our society stands there at the moment.

1020
01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.000
I, I it's actually very interesting that you mentioned

1021
01:10:20.009 --> 01:10:25.149
neurodivergent people, for example, people on the autism spectrum

1022
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.720
because I, I was actually going to ask you

1023
01:10:28.029 --> 01:10:31.810
uh what, what were your thoughts on the neurodiversity

1024
01:10:31.819 --> 01:10:35.040
movement? So I if I understand it correctly, you

1025
01:10:35.049 --> 01:10:39.259
look at it uh mostly positively, right?

1026
01:10:39.529 --> 01:10:43.979
Um Yes, I do, I do. Um IN general.

1027
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:47.060
Um I do because I think um it is

1028
01:10:47.069 --> 01:10:53.180
important that um we provide people with uh a

1029
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:56.319
niche where they can flourish, where they, they're nurtured,

1030
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:59.770
where they can develop their potential at the same

1031
01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:03.109
time. And here, iii I maybe I've heard a

1032
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.479
little bit of a criticism from, from you. Uh

1033
01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:08.319
And here uh but I, if I heard the

1034
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.680
criticism, I do also agree, we have to be

1035
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:17.470
also careful that um that we do not kind

1036
01:11:17.479 --> 01:11:21.759
of um we, we that we, we will have

1037
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:26.149
to accept that uh some symptoms are quite debilitating

1038
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.770
so they are very severe

1039
01:11:27.899 --> 01:11:30.799
and just act actually. Uh I mean, if there

1040
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:33.930
was some sort of criticism in the way I

1041
01:11:33.939 --> 01:11:37.529
expressed my question, it was exactly about that point

1042
01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:42.959
because there are, I think good small criticisms of

1043
01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:46.919
the neurodiversity movement that perhaps it, they apply mostly

1044
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.169
to just a few people and not most people

1045
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.259
of the movement where there's a risk of trivializing

1046
01:11:54.270 --> 01:12:00.109
people that really suffer severely from certain, for example,

1047
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.459
extreme forms of autism and other conditions like that.

1048
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:04.970
Right.

1049
01:12:05.549 --> 01:12:08.839
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Um, YEAH. So

1050
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.660
this is what we would have to be careful

1051
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:14.779
as a society not to, exactly, not to trivialize

1052
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:18.629
it. Um, YEAH. But, uh, in, in general I

1053
01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.600
think we, as a society we have to be

1054
01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:25.569
much more open to, uh, to variability because this

1055
01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:29.569
actually might open up completely new niches which we

1056
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.689
were not even aware of. So, again, it's about

1057
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.589
potential.

1058
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.080
Mhm. Right. So I would like to get now

1059
01:12:38.089 --> 01:12:43.149
into a trauma and stress, but we've already talked

1060
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.629
a little bit about stress, mostly traumatic experiences then.

1061
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.830
But before we get into what actually counts as

1062
01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:55.720
a traumatic experience, I mean, are there some aspects

1063
01:12:55.729 --> 01:13:00.330
of how our memory and emotions work that you

1064
01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:04.640
think would be most relevant for people to understand

1065
01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:09.419
that would apply to uh traumatic ex or to

1066
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.759
how we understand traumatic experiences?

1067
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:20.029
Mhm. So, um uh can I just rephrase it?

1068
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.529
So, um you want or the question is how

1069
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.890
emotions connect to memory? Is, is this or, or,

1070
01:13:27.899 --> 01:13:29.930
or is it, um,

1071
01:13:30.299 --> 01:13:32.560
yeah, because I, I mean, I guess that, uh

1072
01:13:32.569 --> 01:13:36.790
perhaps uh when we're talking about dramatic experiences and

1073
01:13:36.799 --> 01:13:39.899
trying to understand how they work and so on,

1074
01:13:40.169 --> 01:13:44.279
uh two very important aspects of our psychology that

1075
01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:49.220
play role here are memory and emotion, right? And

1076
01:13:49.319 --> 01:13:51.279
uh and basically what I was asking you o

1077
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:53.919
of course, this is a, I guess a very

1078
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.810
broad question, but what would you think are perhaps

1079
01:13:57.819 --> 01:14:01.859
some of the aspects of how our memory works

1080
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:06.470
and our, and our emotion connects to memory that

1081
01:14:06.479 --> 01:14:10.549
then allow for us to have an understanding of

1082
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.520
what a traumatic experience is. That, that's my

1083
01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:19.390
question. Yeah, I understand. OK. So um so there

1084
01:14:19.399 --> 01:14:23.620
is of course, a plethora of um evidence that

1085
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:29.229
emotions are strongly influence memory, especially episodic memory. Why

1086
01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:33.339
is that? Because that's uh uh has a lot

1087
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:37.330
to do with emotions and how they um change

1088
01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:42.366
our perception per se. Because we um emotions increase

1089
01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:47.395
our uh awareness that um our attention to focus

1090
01:14:47.405 --> 01:14:51.295
on specific details, um think of accidents or something

1091
01:14:51.306 --> 01:14:55.045
where all of a sudden our um uh censor

1092
01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:58.835
threshold gets lowered and we remember very, very minute

1093
01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:03.916
details about, you know, crashing glass or about um

1094
01:15:03.925 --> 01:15:07.441
it looks like it feels like the accident took

1095
01:15:07.452 --> 01:15:10.532
much longer, uh like a minute and it, in

1096
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:14.032
reality was only less than a second probably. Uh

1097
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:16.731
And this is because our sensory threshold has, has

1098
01:15:16.742 --> 01:15:21.762
been decreased and we are perceiving, perceiving many more

1099
01:15:21.771 --> 01:15:27.352
details, smells, sounds um tactile information. So this is

1100
01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:31.830
this is this is well known. Um NOW, um

1101
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.069
this is evolutionarily important because emotions are kind of

1102
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.470
a label that inform us or that kind of

1103
01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:44.689
strength and synaptic connections. Um TO tell us this

1104
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.839
is an important memory, you should not forget that.

1105
01:15:48.319 --> 01:15:53.370
Um AND uh it also emotions also help us

1106
01:15:53.379 --> 01:15:57.979
that they guide us through the environment and um

1107
01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:03.919
give or facilitate the detection, quick detection of something

1108
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:08.339
that's relevant for our um FFFF for us. Like

1109
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:11.819
um yeah, any, any sort of uh stimuli like

1110
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.939
maybe a friend or foe or food or, or

1111
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:21.970
whatever might be relevant now um related to um

1112
01:16:21.979 --> 01:16:26.359
why is it that uh in traumatic experiences we

1113
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:32.370
remember um things. So Ooo what, what happens in

1114
01:16:32.379 --> 01:16:37.229
traumatic experiences uh on the emotional level? Um So

1115
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.290
there, there is a, there is a few things

1116
01:16:39.299 --> 01:16:45.720
to unpack here um on, on one hand. So

1117
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:54.569
um see um one thing I've already said is

1118
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:59.330
that uh it um lowers the threshold for sensory

1119
01:16:59.339 --> 01:17:06.609
perception. Um And uh stress itself uh has a

1120
01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:12.390
um uh uh i it, it stress helps us

1121
01:17:12.399 --> 01:17:17.529
to uh process this stimuli um very fast. Um

1122
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:26.220
BECAUSE it um um it takes the um unconscious

1123
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:30.720
route via Amygdala, via uh the hypothalamus and the

1124
01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.680
uh uh uh and, and the Amygdala. And um

1125
01:17:33.689 --> 01:17:37.609
it does not need to um go into um

1126
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:41.279
into the cognitive uh more aware route or the

1127
01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:46.259
conscious route. Um And um gives us a very

1128
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:50.089
quick perception of something that um that might be

1129
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:54.330
a threat to us. Um And this unconscious uh

1130
01:17:54.339 --> 01:17:59.169
change in our physiology can persist if the stress

1131
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.049
level like an acute stress level, like in the

1132
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:07.589
case of um uh developmental trauma, complex trauma, you

1133
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.419
know, if there is a prolonged um uh stress

1134
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:16.700
level, then um this prolonged stress level, this um

1135
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:20.759
this this prolonged stress level will have um a

1136
01:18:20.839 --> 01:18:25.700
an effect on uh how we detect um stimuli

1137
01:18:25.924 --> 01:18:27.765
in the future. So in my book, I write

1138
01:18:27.774 --> 01:18:30.714
at some point uh as it changes the stress

1139
01:18:30.725 --> 01:18:33.174
axis and it actually change, it changes the whole

1140
01:18:33.194 --> 01:18:37.024
physiology. That means uh Children who have been exposed

1141
01:18:37.035 --> 01:18:40.015
to this type of trauma very often live in

1142
01:18:40.024 --> 01:18:44.490
a relabeled world. Um That means they are in

1143
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.899
a constant state of alert where the um where

1144
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:53.560
the the uh synthetic uh nervous system. So the

1145
01:18:53.569 --> 01:18:57.930
autonomic nervous system is always in a flight to

1146
01:18:57.939 --> 01:19:02.125
fight response. So, um yeah, that, that, that's uh

1147
01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:06.444
something. The other thing um that that also is

1148
01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:11.365
very typical for um survivors of trauma is that

1149
01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:17.495
they have very often intrusive uh hyperemic uh memories.

1150
01:19:17.504 --> 01:19:22.399
So, memories that feel as if they are experienced

1151
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:26.600
now in the present with very strong details. And

1152
01:19:26.609 --> 01:19:29.560
that is again related to what I said earlier

1153
01:19:29.569 --> 01:19:34.970
about this uh uh lowering of the sensory threshold

1154
01:19:34.979 --> 01:19:38.419
and remembering many, many of the details. Yeah. And

1155
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:41.109
then there is some of the opposite uh things

1156
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.819
which I ha I haven't mentioned uh now and

1157
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:46.950
but just let me say a few words about

1158
01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:50.609
that is that in some cases when there is

1159
01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.470
stress level is extremely high, um people completely forget

1160
01:19:55.479 --> 01:20:00.839
the because they cannot integrate um or the the

1161
01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:05.740
the memory cannot um be integrated in, in, in

1162
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:09.200
the net in the existing network of, of memories.

1163
01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:12.189
So they, it, it's almost as if they forget.

1164
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.629
But um this is um yeah, this this happens

1165
01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.209
especially with very young Children uh before the explicit

1166
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.040
memory is fully formed. Uh

1167
01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:28.560
A and this also applies to, for example, contexts

1168
01:20:28.569 --> 01:20:34.350
of unpredictability and help helplessness like like for example,

1169
01:20:34.359 --> 01:20:40.419
low social status, poverty, lack of social support and

1170
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:41.490
contexts like

1171
01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:48.200
that. Exactly. Because um especially that the last thing

1172
01:20:48.209 --> 01:20:51.950
I said about if it's uh I if it

1173
01:20:51.959 --> 01:20:55.500
doesn't, if you don't even have an active explicit

1174
01:20:55.509 --> 01:21:00.259
memory about the incident, but you're still suffering from

1175
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:05.060
uh a change in your um in, in, in

1176
01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:07.160
your stress axis or in the components of your

1177
01:21:07.169 --> 01:21:13.100
stress axis. Then um this uh gives you a

1178
01:21:13.109 --> 01:21:16.189
different way of reacting to stimuli for a long

1179
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.370
time. It has been believed that uh we must

1180
01:21:19.379 --> 01:21:25.310
find high cortisol levels. But um paradoxically, um more

1181
01:21:25.319 --> 01:21:29.229
recently, it has been shown that people suffering from

1182
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:35.180
severe long term stress, they adapt their organism to

1183
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:38.970
this extremely high stress level uh by changing the

1184
01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:43.319
stress axis and they actually have relatively low um

1185
01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:47.859
uh um cortisol. Uh But this happens on the

1186
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:52.470
expense of um and like an allo static load,

1187
01:21:52.479 --> 01:21:55.750
that means whenever they experience something that is a

1188
01:21:55.759 --> 01:21:59.379
little bit for us would be a neutral stimulus.

1189
01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:01.359
But for them, it is a little bit um

1190
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:05.729
exciting or something, then their stress uh uh um

1191
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:13.089
reaction, stress response completely uh a exceeds a normal

1192
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.500
response. So this is um yeah. So these, the,

1193
01:22:16.509 --> 01:22:22.060
these people who are um uh trauma survivors, especially

1194
01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:25.930
for long term, they have really significant change in

1195
01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:28.419
the neurophysiology. Mhm A

1196
01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:32.410
a and so related to that, there's this common

1197
01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:39.069
idea that adversities make Children grow stronger. But is

1198
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.250
that really the case? I mean, is there good

1199
01:22:41.259 --> 01:22:44.370
enough evidence to support that idea?

1200
01:22:44.879 --> 01:22:49.089
Mhm But this is, this is a really important

1201
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.850
thing because uh you can uh then use that

1202
01:22:53.859 --> 01:22:58.200
um to draw policies and this is kind of

1203
01:22:58.209 --> 01:23:01.370
the standard view that you very often read in

1204
01:23:01.379 --> 01:23:05.140
management books and so on. Um But these management

1205
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:08.450
books are addressed to, you know, people that um

1206
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:13.970
live in relatively stable environments that are don't come

1207
01:23:13.979 --> 01:23:17.520
from traumatic experiences. So, on one hand, um I

1208
01:23:17.529 --> 01:23:20.069
want to cite again, you have already mentioned him

1209
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.810
today. Uh Robert Sapolsky. On the other hand, I

1210
01:23:22.819 --> 01:23:25.149
want to say a few things about my own

1211
01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.069
work working with um with psychotherapists. So Robert Sapolsky,

1212
01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:39.379
he already um pointed out that um if so,

1213
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:45.290
it's um he already pointed out that um if

1214
01:23:45.299 --> 01:23:48.890
uh you have uh a high level of stress

1215
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:55.209
then being pushed towards more uncertainty, you know, and

1216
01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:58.500
this kind of learning zone and go out and

1217
01:23:58.509 --> 01:24:05.399
try to new things. Yeah, this actually um triggers

1218
01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:08.390
a whole different stress response than it would be

1219
01:24:08.399 --> 01:24:11.770
in other, would trigger in other people. And from

1220
01:24:11.779 --> 01:24:15.399
my own experience, I have seen that in um

1221
01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:21.459
when working with psychotherapists that um even very neutral

1222
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:26.419
stimuli trigger a whole plethora of reactions that you

1223
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:29.120
could not imagine that you would not see in

1224
01:24:29.129 --> 01:24:32.810
a setting with uh other kids, for example. And

1225
01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:38.959
that really um makes me um rethink that this

1226
01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:45.009
has to be um communicated more widely to policymakers

1227
01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:48.160
to people who are working with kids. So yy,

1228
01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.750
you, you don't push them out to learn something

1229
01:24:51.759 --> 01:24:53.910
new to get out of the comfort zone to

1230
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:57.240
um this has to be, has to be done

1231
01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:01.910
very, very carefully. Um BECAUSE we're just dealing with

1232
01:25:01.919 --> 01:25:07.189
highly vulnerable kids or, or grownups. Yeah. So this

1233
01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.370
stays long into adulthood, maybe your whole life.

1234
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:16.370
Yeah. And later we're going to get into resilience

1235
01:25:16.379 --> 01:25:19.689
and how people develop it and what it means

1236
01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.839
exactly. But just before that, I would like to

1237
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:26.540
ask you a little bit about attachment theory because

1238
01:25:26.549 --> 01:25:31.410
it seems that the people we develop relationships with

1239
01:25:31.419 --> 01:25:35.819
in early life and uh whoever they might be

1240
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.310
and we're going to talk about that those relationships

1241
01:25:39.319 --> 01:25:42.220
seems to uh seem to be very important. And

1242
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:44.149
then I also want to ask you, of course,

1243
01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.770
if attachment, the, the attachment style one develops in

1244
01:25:48.899 --> 01:25:53.069
childhood and so on is fixed or not, we're

1245
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.359
going to get into that. But I mean, what

1246
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:59.069
role do you think that attachment theory plays in

1247
01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.890
this context? Of trying to uh I mean, in

1248
01:26:02.899 --> 01:26:07.330
the broader context of developmental psychology.

1249
01:26:08.529 --> 01:26:12.350
But first of all, I think as humans, we

1250
01:26:12.359 --> 01:26:17.049
are uh a hyper selfie species. So attachment is

1251
01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:23.259
not only something that is um evolutionary um put

1252
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:28.390
down in our uh biology. So we're actively uh

1253
01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:32.750
we need because we're uh the species that is

1254
01:26:32.759 --> 01:26:36.419
born relatively early um in as compared to other

1255
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:41.040
primates with a relatively uh very uh immature brain

1256
01:26:41.089 --> 01:26:44.040
where there is a lot uh uh still to

1257
01:26:44.049 --> 01:26:48.319
develop, that means we're helpless. We need the um

1258
01:26:48.402 --> 01:26:54.812
support of caregivers. And of course, um attachment theory,

1259
01:26:54.823 --> 01:26:59.092
this is uh this goes back to John Bowie

1260
01:26:59.232 --> 01:27:01.433
and Marie AINS was in the, in the 19

1261
01:27:01.442 --> 01:27:04.792
fifties. So, um there has been a lot of

1262
01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:08.783
amendments made to, to this theory but the key

1263
01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:12.462
principles or the key messages uh still remain true.

1264
01:27:12.562 --> 01:27:17.346
So, um we need um care give us otherwise

1265
01:27:17.355 --> 01:27:21.405
we could not, uh we could not develop if

1266
01:27:21.416 --> 01:27:25.145
we are severely neglected. If we um if there

1267
01:27:25.155 --> 01:27:28.545
is nobody looking after us after us as a

1268
01:27:28.556 --> 01:27:33.695
child, this um triggers an immense stress in us.

1269
01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:37.706
Children cannot regulate stress by themselves. They can uh

1270
01:27:37.715 --> 01:27:41.226
upregulate the cortisol levels, but what they cannot regulate,

1271
01:27:41.235 --> 01:27:45.080
they cannot down regulate yet by themselves. So they

1272
01:27:45.089 --> 01:27:47.879
need to be down regulated. Stress needs to be

1273
01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:52.660
down regulated from the um um caregiver externally. So,

1274
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:56.020
you know, uh body contact Oxytocin. Oxytocin is a

1275
01:27:56.029 --> 01:28:00.790
wonderful uh antagonist to, to, to uh co so,

1276
01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:05.290
so this is what all this attachment is is

1277
01:28:05.299 --> 01:28:09.439
for because um we need in order to survive

1278
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:13.410
um a newborn and AAA an infant needs a

1279
01:28:13.419 --> 01:28:18.470
connection to, to a caregiver. Um Now, this is

1280
01:28:18.479 --> 01:28:23.060
something that was very controversial about uh yeah, 70

1281
01:28:23.069 --> 01:28:28.350
years ago, maybe even 6050 years ago. Um I

1282
01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:31.419
think everybody accepts that now. So this is not,

1283
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:36.660
this is no longer controversial. However, what you already

1284
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:41.890
mentioned is that this is a developmental process. And

1285
01:28:41.899 --> 01:28:46.509
the question is, is this fixed or what, what

1286
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.370
happens in adulthood? And basically, this is not so

1287
01:28:50.379 --> 01:28:53.649
easy to answer. First of all, um it is,

1288
01:28:53.859 --> 01:28:57.169
it is a developmental process and it also is

1289
01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.529
um split in different phases. So we have like

1290
01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.870
an early pro phase, we have a um then

1291
01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:05.459
the this preference learning phase, then we have this

1292
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:12.549
aversion uh learn phase um that goes along with

1293
01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.700
neuro anatomical changes. So, aversion learning for example, sets

1294
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:19.810
in when the maturation of the Amygdala happens. So

1295
01:29:19.819 --> 01:29:22.140
about the age of 7 to 8 months in

1296
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:26.759
humans uh in other in chimpanzees about four months

1297
01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:30.240
and so on. So um you can see, but

1298
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:33.640
then there is a partner correcting phase at the

1299
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:36.850
age of, you know, three years or something. When

1300
01:29:36.859 --> 01:29:40.660
people, when Children start to begin to develop the

1301
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:43.520
theory of mind. And then what you said is,

1302
01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:48.180
yeah, we have an attachment style. This is something

1303
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:51.200
how we, we observe that we, we experience it.

1304
01:29:51.209 --> 01:29:54.589
This is how we expect that people act in

1305
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:59.970
a partnership with us. However, uh if you have

1306
01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:05.450
a um a lot of positive experience with secondary

1307
01:30:05.459 --> 01:30:09.660
caregiver, secondary attachment persons and that can even be

1308
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:12.770
your teacher or your, I don't know, coach, uh

1309
01:30:12.779 --> 01:30:17.930
sports coach or whatever. Um EVEN then there is

1310
01:30:17.939 --> 01:30:22.080
good potential that you, at least with some attachment

1311
01:30:22.089 --> 01:30:24.229
stars, maybe not with the disorganized, but with uh

1312
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.970
the other uh uh two attachment stars um that

1313
01:30:28.979 --> 01:30:32.109
you can balance out and you can improve and

1314
01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.240
get a secure attachment in a partnership play later

1315
01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.330
on in life. Mhm.

1316
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.160
Oh, ok. So I, I have two kinds of

1317
01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:45.040
questions here. Uh First of all, um when it

1318
01:30:45.049 --> 01:30:50.399
comes to the primary caregiver or caregivers, does it

1319
01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:53.379
really matter who they are? I mean, does it

1320
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:57.830
necessarily need to be the mother or the father

1321
01:30:57.839 --> 01:31:01.979
or even someone from the brother family or can

1322
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:06.879
it be really anyone as long as we develop

1323
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:10.839
uh ki uh a secure kind of attachment to

1324
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:11.109
them?

1325
01:31:11.729 --> 01:31:17.299
Yeah. Um Yeah, you, you actually um really pinpointed

1326
01:31:17.310 --> 01:31:19.830
towards one of the weaknesses of the original, of

1327
01:31:19.839 --> 01:31:23.959
the traditional um attachment theory as formulated by Bowie

1328
01:31:24.009 --> 01:31:27.750
because he basically just looked at the diad bond

1329
01:31:27.759 --> 01:31:29.350
between mother and child.

1330
01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.839
Yeah. And I, and I mean, to be fair

1331
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:35.839
back then, uh perhaps we didn't have enough anthropology

1332
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:38.979
to know that we are co-operative breeders and he

1333
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:43.410
was starting from a point of uh evolutionary theory,

1334
01:31:43.419 --> 01:31:46.220
right? He was very influenced by evolutionary theory. And

1335
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:51.540
back then, we fought mostly about uh females as

1336
01:31:51.549 --> 01:31:56.080
the primary and perhaps only caregivers, right? So just

1337
01:31:56.089 --> 01:31:56.729
to be fair.

1338
01:31:57.009 --> 01:32:00.069
Yeah, you're right. However, and here I have to

1339
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.390
contradict a little bit from his own biography. Uh

1340
01:32:04.399 --> 01:32:08.009
John Bobby should have known that it's not necessarily

1341
01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.879
the mother because his attachment figure. And that was

1342
01:32:10.890 --> 01:32:13.629
actually the reason why he started to um venture

1343
01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.560
into this field. His primary um attachment figure was

1344
01:32:17.569 --> 01:32:22.279
actually his uh child carer called I think Minnie.

1345
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:25.959
So the first four years of his life, um

1346
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:27.629
you know, he was in coming from a rich

1347
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.709
family. So it was not the mother actually being

1348
01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:33.819
the caregiver looking after him, it was actually an

1349
01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:37.129
ow parent, somebody else who took this role. Now,

1350
01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:41.310
what you said is absolutely correct. So um does

1351
01:32:41.319 --> 01:32:43.950
it need to be the mother at that point

1352
01:32:43.959 --> 01:32:48.649
we did not have um or the the there

1353
01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:55.250
was not enough knowledge from anthropology studies. Um EVEN

1354
01:32:55.259 --> 01:32:58.180
he kind of uh bo we also excluded fathers.

1355
01:32:58.189 --> 01:33:02.379
But now we know that that uh father can

1356
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:05.080
be as good as an attachment figure as the

1357
01:33:05.089 --> 01:33:08.770
as mother, in terms of stress regulation, in terms

1358
01:33:08.779 --> 01:33:12.884
of bonding, you know, even uh oxytocin release is

1359
01:33:12.895 --> 01:33:15.944
it has been shown measured by, by fathers or

1360
01:33:15.955 --> 01:33:18.975
not just fathers, but by a male caregiver. Let

1361
01:33:18.984 --> 01:33:23.134
me just be neutral there now, um, as you

1362
01:33:23.145 --> 01:33:27.790
said already, um So what about now with the

1363
01:33:27.799 --> 01:33:32.520
new information we have from, um, from anthropology studies?

1364
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:40.939
So, actually, interestingly there is um some uh populations,

1365
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:45.259
these are, which is still hunter gatherers. Um And

1366
01:33:45.379 --> 01:33:48.000
there it has been shown that the very young

1367
01:33:48.009 --> 01:33:53.439
Children uh have many primary caregivers up to, I

1368
01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:58.689
don't know, 18 or something. And, um, and these

1369
01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:06.109
all can function as, um, there um with them,

1370
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.250
they also develop very strong attachment bonds. And interestingly,

1371
01:34:10.259 --> 01:34:15.810
these uh Children also show much lower um stranger

1372
01:34:15.819 --> 01:34:19.310
anxieties at this, you know, age of 7 to

1373
01:34:19.319 --> 01:34:22.390
8 months. So, yeah. So it, no, it doesn't

1374
01:34:22.399 --> 01:34:23.629
have to be the mother. It has to be

1375
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:29.270
somebody who provides safety nurturing um stress relief, uh

1376
01:34:29.279 --> 01:34:31.770
regulation. Yeah. Mhm

1377
01:34:32.569 --> 01:34:34.879
OK. So the, the second kind of question I

1378
01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:37.839
had here was OK. So it's basically a two

1379
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:41.470
part question. So the first part is ju just

1380
01:34:41.479 --> 01:34:47.370
to make this point clear uh attachment styles later

1381
01:34:47.379 --> 01:34:51.819
later on in life, apply to basically any kind

1382
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:57.229
of social relationship, right to friendships, to romantic relationships

1383
01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.990
and so on or not.

1384
01:34:59.759 --> 01:35:05.299
Basically, yes. But the closer uh the friendship and

1385
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:10.029
usually partnership, um the more relevant it is. So

1386
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.509
with just normal distant friends or at work, you

1387
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.669
can adjust very well. But the closer it gets

1388
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.939
emotionally because this you have this so called inner

1389
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:26.109
working model that kind of triggers your emotional model

1390
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.430
that that you've learned in childhood. Yeah.

1391
01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:32.120
A and when it comes to that bit, we

1392
01:35:32.129 --> 01:35:38.979
mentioned about attachment styles potentially changing across the lifespan.

1393
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:41.209
I, I mean, it just came to my mind,

1394
01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:44.689
I don't know if there's any specific research on

1395
01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.430
this, but it just came to my mind if

1396
01:35:47.439 --> 01:35:51.089
we should also perhaps think about attachment style as

1397
01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:55.209
we did back when we talked about dynamical systems

1398
01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:58.299
theory and other psychological traits. I mean, could it

1399
01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:01.459
be the case that I don't know in, in

1400
01:36:01.549 --> 01:36:06.689
particular periods of our life? Because we might experience,

1401
01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.819
I don't know particular kinds of friendships or romantic

1402
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:14.939
relationships. Even if we, we grew up being securely

1403
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:20.890
attached, then we might become circumstantially more anxiously attached,

1404
01:36:20.899 --> 01:36:24.180
more violent or the opposite.

1405
01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:29.209
Yep. Um So, so the, the opposite becoming more

1406
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:35.459
securely attached because of positive um uh input from

1407
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:40.120
on relationships as adults that has been relatively uh

1408
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:44.680
well documented also the opposite. Um I have seen

1409
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:47.729
and I have um very interesting as I've, I

1410
01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:50.609
very recently um was part in a, in a

1411
01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:54.500
session with a um with a therapist. Um WHERE,

1412
01:36:54.509 --> 01:36:57.973
where this was really interesting to, to, to see

1413
01:36:57.982 --> 01:36:59.862
also, you know, to go a little bit away

1414
01:36:59.873 --> 01:37:03.252
from the Ivory tower and from the theoretical research

1415
01:37:03.263 --> 01:37:05.292
and, and look into how it is plays out

1416
01:37:05.303 --> 01:37:07.342
in real life and, and where you could really

1417
01:37:07.433 --> 01:37:10.933
um follow and monitor what happened there. So yes,

1418
01:37:10.942 --> 01:37:15.493
also if you have um experienced a secure um

1419
01:37:15.502 --> 01:37:18.375
attachment style and you've developed a uh in a

1420
01:37:18.386 --> 01:37:21.005
model of a secure attachment style because of uh

1421
01:37:21.016 --> 01:37:24.996
safe and um your needs were well met, emotional

1422
01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:27.866
needs were well met, met in childhood. But then

1423
01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:32.366
growing up, especially in um in adolescence where you

1424
01:37:32.375 --> 01:37:36.186
have a very strong reorganization of your um neuroplastic

1425
01:37:36.206 --> 01:37:40.346
neuro organization of your brain. Um Then you again,

1426
01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:46.000
um uh if you're there exposed to um severe

1427
01:37:46.009 --> 01:37:51.680
disappointments, actually, this can cause um a change in,

1428
01:37:51.689 --> 01:37:55.160
in, in the attachment style. Yeah, that not of

1429
01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:58.720
course, not, not uh to, to your primary caregivers,

1430
01:37:58.729 --> 01:38:01.990
but then to how you interact with further with

1431
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.830
other partners. Yeah,

1432
01:38:02.839 --> 01:38:05.680
or a a actually that last point that you

1433
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:08.370
mentioned there is it possible for us to have

1434
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.589
different kinds of attachment styles with different people that

1435
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.430
treat us differently?

1436
01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:18.910
That is interesting. That is interesting and that was

1437
01:38:18.919 --> 01:38:22.759
by no means um covered in the original um

1438
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:26.770
attachment theory. However, there is more and more evidence

1439
01:38:26.779 --> 01:38:30.549
point in this direction. Yes. Um And this is

1440
01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.129
especially fostered if you have grow if you grew,

1441
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:37.209
grew up in a family when you had several

1442
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.750
siblings, because there you developed kind of different kind

1443
01:38:41.759 --> 01:38:47.299
of models um di mo models with different people.

1444
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:49.750
So yes, but it's, it's also true because you

1445
01:38:49.759 --> 01:38:51.790
can have different attachment style to your father and

1446
01:38:51.799 --> 01:38:53.750
your to your mother. So even there, you can

1447
01:38:53.759 --> 01:38:56.490
can can also have it. And Um So, so,

1448
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.500
yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is, this is more recent

1449
01:38:58.509 --> 01:39:00.750
study as far as I know, but uh very

1450
01:39:00.759 --> 01:39:01.390
interesting. Yeah.

1451
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:05.169
OK. So, uh I would like to go through

1452
01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.609
resilience now and then after resilience, I have just

1453
01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:14.080
one last general question to ask you. But what

1454
01:39:14.089 --> 01:39:19.450
is resilience then? What does it mean? Psychologically speaking

1455
01:39:19.459 --> 01:39:23.770
to be a resilient person? And I, we develop

1456
01:39:23.779 --> 01:39:29.470
resilience since we've already talked about uh attachment styles,

1457
01:39:29.479 --> 01:39:35.689
for example, and living in unpredictable and helpless environments

1458
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.770
and the effects that that has on our psychology.

1459
01:39:38.779 --> 01:39:41.600
So how do we develop resilience?

1460
01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:46.609
Very good. Yeah. Um ACTUALLY, probably the most important

1461
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.000
question and in my book, I unfortunately, really only

1462
01:39:50.009 --> 01:39:54.970
dedicate the last bit to it um because that

1463
01:39:54.979 --> 01:39:57.189
was not the main focus, but uh I think

1464
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.589
this is something that needs to be developed much

1465
01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.029
more. So what is resilience resilience is in the

1466
01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:09.089
face of advertises uh it uh you can overcome

1467
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:14.830
these negative uh these negative uh experiences and uh

1468
01:40:14.839 --> 01:40:17.890
you can still grow actually, it's even more than

1469
01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:20.600
that, you cannot only overcome but you, you get

1470
01:40:20.609 --> 01:40:28.569
even stronger. So, um and this um research has

1471
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:36.209
originally started um by Emy Vanna and she looked

1472
01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:41.689
at um Children in uh at the Hawaiian Island

1473
01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:46.379
of Kawai. And um many of these Children grew

1474
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:50.149
up in, in, in really severe poverty. And um

1475
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:55.229
a lot of these Children later in life in

1476
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.089
their teenage years and later in life, then I

1477
01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:02.850
had destructive or self destructive behavior and ended up

1478
01:41:02.859 --> 01:41:08.359
being alcoholics or um committing suicide or having very

1479
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:13.060
unstable partnerships and so on. However, really surprising it

1480
01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:16.549
was in the same population under very, very similar,

1481
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.350
if not the same circumstances about a third of

1482
01:41:19.359 --> 01:41:24.939
these Children uh did not develop these destructive behaviors.

1483
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:28.419
So they were kind of resilient. They developed, they

1484
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:32.859
succeeded in life, they flourished. They actually, despite all

1485
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:37.569
these adversaries, they, they grew stronger and they um

1486
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.109
yeah, they, they were on top of their lives.

1487
01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.649
Now, what she found out and that has been

1488
01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:47.939
confirmed by many other studies is um these Children

1489
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:52.729
who did not um go into this self destructive

1490
01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:58.160
or destructive pathway. Uh WERE those who had um

1491
01:41:58.169 --> 01:42:01.979
at least one person who cared for them and

1492
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:04.259
it does did not even have to be the

1493
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:07.529
primary caregiver like the mother or the father. It

1494
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.020
was in some cases, it was a teacher or

1495
01:42:10.029 --> 01:42:16.629
something and this caring person kind of counterbalance, then

1496
01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:22.160
all these adversaries including missing parental bonds and alcoholism

1497
01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:26.250
and drugs and poverty and so on. So um

1498
01:42:26.259 --> 01:42:29.870
yeah, that, that uh yeah, that, that, that was

1499
01:42:29.879 --> 01:42:31.879
I think kind of this is what was when

1500
01:42:31.890 --> 01:42:36.640
this resilient research was born. And now obviously this

1501
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:40.549
is a really powerful message because that means that

1502
01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:46.640
at least one caring person, her child um should

1503
01:42:46.649 --> 01:42:51.850
help a child to develop uh into a um

1504
01:42:51.859 --> 01:42:55.350
an adult that uh can master his or her

1505
01:42:55.359 --> 01:43:00.580
life. Now, in some cases, this is, this is

1506
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:05.000
not easily possible. There is the caregivers are missing.

1507
01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:08.009
So you asked me, so what, what are the

1508
01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.310
factors? So how can we contribute um to, to

1509
01:43:11.319 --> 01:43:15.799
making Children more resilient? And here I draw from

1510
01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:20.310
um insights that come actually ff from uh a

1511
01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:26.490
few insights um but amongst others um that come

1512
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.870
from, from the so called circle of courage that

1513
01:43:28.879 --> 01:43:35.160
was developed by um the Indi Indi indigenous population

1514
01:43:35.169 --> 01:43:41.799
of um Northern America. They um showed that some

1515
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:49.959
of the uh the um important key factors that

1516
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:52.560
they need or elements that they need to support

1517
01:43:52.569 --> 01:43:56.890
Children to, to grow and to, to develop healthily

1518
01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.890
that are actually um can that, that are going

1519
01:44:00.899 --> 01:44:03.799
across cultures. So that's holds true for all, all,

1520
01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:06.839
all cultures. And the first thing you need is

1521
01:44:06.850 --> 01:44:10.990
to establish uh secure a safe environment. So this

1522
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.950
before you do any other interventions, this the first

1523
01:44:13.959 --> 01:44:17.950
thing is the child has to be safe, take

1524
01:44:17.959 --> 01:44:21.669
him her out of the unsafe environment, provide an

1525
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.180
environment where he or she feels safe. And then

1526
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:27.950
the other four points come from the uh circle

1527
01:44:27.959 --> 01:44:31.879
of courage. And the first one is um establish

1528
01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:35.919
an emotional bond. So make sure that there is

1529
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:37.830
a sense of belonging. This is the first one.

1530
01:44:37.839 --> 01:44:41.660
The second one is um they call it mastery,

1531
01:44:41.890 --> 01:44:45.410
put some challenge, but only those challenges that can

1532
01:44:45.509 --> 01:44:49.879
realistically be mastered by the child, you know. Um

1533
01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:53.220
So, so I think um Levitsky would call this

1534
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:57.029
the zone of proximal development, help the child, but

1535
01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.669
make sure it's possible for the child to master

1536
01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:04.560
it. So um offering learning increasingly complex tasks for

1537
01:45:04.569 --> 01:45:06.359
learning. So this is the second one, the third

1538
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.799
one, shift the power to the learner. So provide

1539
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:16.919
him or her with agency self actualization, give the

1540
01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:20.319
faith into his or her hand. Um And the

1541
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:22.509
last thing is, and this is something that I

1542
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.549
feel that society is missing more and more of

1543
01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.689
it is that build a relationship of reciprocity. That

1544
01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.209
means altruism, that means empathy, make sure that the

1545
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:40.279
child understands um that for whatever he or she

1546
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:43.250
gives he or she gets things in return in

1547
01:45:43.259 --> 01:45:46.200
a very positive way. So these, these are kind

1548
01:45:46.209 --> 01:45:49.089
of the, the the the the four points of

1549
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:52.080
the circle of courage and the sa safety part.

1550
01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:54.680
So this is kind of um yeah, what I

1551
01:45:54.689 --> 01:45:57.950
I think that the most important takeaway messages from

1552
01:45:57.959 --> 01:45:59.250
how to build resilience.

1553
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:04.290
OK. So one more question about resilience then because

1554
01:46:04.299 --> 01:46:07.580
you were talking mostly if I understood it correctly,

1555
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:12.479
mostly about Children there. But what if the person

1556
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:16.095
is already an adult and they have gun through

1557
01:46:16.165 --> 01:46:21.634
an entire childhood and life of trauma? Do you

1558
01:46:21.645 --> 01:46:25.694
think that perhaps there might be cases where unfortunately

1559
01:46:25.705 --> 01:46:30.384
it's already too late to help uh those people?

1560
01:46:30.975 --> 01:46:34.725
Yeah. So I mean, I would never ever uh

1561
01:46:34.734 --> 01:46:37.685
say it's too late because I think nobody deserves

1562
01:46:37.694 --> 01:46:40.984
that. Everybody needs um people who believe in them

1563
01:46:40.995 --> 01:46:46.919
and who support them. However, um I have investigated,

1564
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:51.240
looked and also um I in, in, from practical

1565
01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:54.319
examples which I've seen, there are some cases which

1566
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:59.009
would require an immense effort and very often um

1567
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.939
people do not believe anymore that this is possible.

1568
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.180
So, and then you have the, the, the, the

1569
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:10.870
first step is not even initiated because if you

1570
01:47:10.879 --> 01:47:14.419
are already working with a client or if um

1571
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:18.799
a grown up thinks that there is no chance

1572
01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:22.700
for him or her for happiness, for partnership or

1573
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:30.979
something because of severe um trauma experienced. Um And

1574
01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.649
in my book, I give a few historical examples.

1575
01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:38.870
Um ONE from the uh Canadian um uh Children,

1576
01:47:38.879 --> 01:47:42.299
the Du Plessis uh Children who, who grew up

1577
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:47.979
in these orphanages in Canada. Um If you don't

1578
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:50.770
give yourself a chance, then I think it's difficult

1579
01:47:50.779 --> 01:47:54.169
because in the end, it must come from uh

1580
01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:59.810
your own willingness to um to become resilient, to

1581
01:47:59.819 --> 01:48:03.729
flourish to, to um yeah, to shape your future.

1582
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:09.370
Mhm So uh I would like to ask you

1583
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:12.410
uh just to wrap up the interview, a final

1584
01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:17.189
question about uh a, a broad topic of your

1585
01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:21.270
book that is actually something that you introduce the

1586
01:48:21.279 --> 01:48:24.399
book with. And I think that we have already

1587
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:29.180
at least several times mentioned or referenced it indirectly

1588
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:33.129
during our conversation. But when it comes to the

1589
01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:37.009
study of human psychology, specifically, what do you think

1590
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.759
it's important for people to keep in mind about

1591
01:48:40.029 --> 01:48:43.790
how science works and how it is done? Because

1592
01:48:43.799 --> 01:48:47.720
of course, we've talked here about several different paradigms

1593
01:48:47.729 --> 01:48:52.529
and disciplines. We've talked about behavior, genetics, developmental psychology,

1594
01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:57.549
neuroscience, uh uh and, and particular kinds of paradigms

1595
01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:03.180
like dynamical systems theory and its counterparts. So, w

1596
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:06.580
what do you think uh would be important for

1597
01:49:06.589 --> 01:49:10.720
people to keep in mind when they are working

1598
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:15.080
through the lens of a particular paradigm in science

1599
01:49:15.089 --> 01:49:18.140
that perhaps might be bounded, that is usually bounded

1600
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:25.569
by particular axioms, methodological presuppositions, techniques, concepts, and so

1601
01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:25.859
on.

1602
01:49:26.299 --> 01:49:30.049
Mhm um Well, first of all, let me just

1603
01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:34.069
pick up on something you already said is I

1604
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.729
think when we talk about studying the human minds,

1605
01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:42.330
then uh this is such a complex task that

1606
01:49:42.339 --> 01:49:46.450
this requires anyway, an interdisciplinary endeavor. So there is

1607
01:49:46.459 --> 01:49:49.979
no chance that any discipline has the privilege over

1608
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:53.932
another discipline to elucidate the more important mechanisms or

1609
01:49:53.941 --> 01:49:56.691
more important processes. So I really think and that

1610
01:49:56.702 --> 01:50:01.202
needs to be fostered that there is a collaboration

1611
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:04.801
between scholars from the natural sciences, social sciences and

1612
01:50:04.812 --> 01:50:08.312
humanities. So, and that also should sink into the

1613
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:12.751
brains of the natural scientists. II, I said it

1614
01:50:12.762 --> 01:50:16.784
on purpose now um to, to your question about

1615
01:50:16.793 --> 01:50:19.293
um what do we have to keep in mind

1616
01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:21.613
when we talk about how, how the science work

1617
01:50:21.624 --> 01:50:24.423
as such. So one of the things in here

1618
01:50:24.434 --> 01:50:26.363
I speak from the point of view of a

1619
01:50:26.374 --> 01:50:29.914
natural scientists. So as a researcher, you always want

1620
01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:33.503
to be really objective, you want to avoid, you

1621
01:50:33.514 --> 01:50:36.474
said it looking through the lens of some paradigms,

1622
01:50:36.543 --> 01:50:39.936
you want to avoid that you're uh affected by

1623
01:50:39.945 --> 01:50:45.695
some I don't know, spurious cases, anecdotal evidences uh

1624
01:50:45.706 --> 01:50:49.136
or you want to avoid to become overly attached

1625
01:50:49.145 --> 01:50:52.206
to certain theory because this is something you have

1626
01:50:52.215 --> 01:50:56.246
found or uh because then you will be less

1627
01:50:56.255 --> 01:51:00.215
open to critique to this proof, to counterfactual. Now,

1628
01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.259
um since I've been uh here at the Conrad

1629
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.899
Lawrence Institute uh for Evolution and cognition research, we

1630
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:14.399
were highly inter disciplinary institution um where natural scientists

1631
01:51:14.410 --> 01:51:18.359
uh people from the humanities, especially philosophers and historians

1632
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:22.750
of science work together. And um the longer I've

1633
01:51:22.759 --> 01:51:25.439
been here, the more I've discussed with people, the

1634
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:29.390
more obvious it is to me that true objectivity

1635
01:51:29.399 --> 01:51:33.089
in science is really a naive idea. Yeah. So

1636
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.399
you already pointed that out. So this is you,

1637
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:41.299
we are, our research is always somehow bounded by

1638
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:47.950
some axioms. Um And it is kind of rooted

1639
01:51:47.959 --> 01:51:51.810
very often also in, in a certain zeitgeist. So

1640
01:51:51.819 --> 01:51:56.950
we're following what's popular at the moment. Um No,

1641
01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:03.560
I think we agree here. Science here is needed

1642
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:10.529
almost ex is not totally exact, not always correct.

1643
01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:15.009
Certainly, it's not objective, it's not unbiased. Yeah, this

1644
01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.129
is very surprising to a layperson even maybe even

1645
01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:22.370
surprising to young researchers, young scientists. Yeah, we have

1646
01:52:22.379 --> 01:52:27.200
this really idealistic idea. Yeah. So I think we,

1647
01:52:27.209 --> 01:52:29.910
we the two of us agree on that now

1648
01:52:29.919 --> 01:52:34.339
as also many scientists, most scientists will probably agree

1649
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:38.209
to that. However, I think they will not admit

1650
01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:43.509
that uh very openly. Uh ALTHOUGH they know that

1651
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.529
um the research is based on who is doing

1652
01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:51.080
actually that the, the, the experiment um which methodology

1653
01:52:51.089 --> 01:52:54.410
is used, which expe uh instruments are used now.

1654
01:52:54.419 --> 01:53:00.259
But if I don't admit to that, then um

1655
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:06.270
this is maybe a, a self defense mechanism because

1656
01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:11.979
then uh you do not further um kind of

1657
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:17.950
uh uh uh challenge or you do not um

1658
01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:23.009
uh ignite further distrust uh of the public in

1659
01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:26.100
science because we, we want the public to trust

1660
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:30.879
us. But I, for my part, I see that

1661
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:33.109
in a really different way. I think one of

1662
01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.069
the most important endeavors of research is to grapple

1663
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.220
exactly with these issues, to look at the reality

1664
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:44.439
of scientific constructs to see. Um WHAT is this

1665
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:48.299
demarcation? Where is science? And, and what, what is

1666
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:54.180
pseudoscience? For example, what are the problems with inductive

1667
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:59.709
inferences? Yeah. Can I um or how can I

1668
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:05.279
establish whether um I there there are some systematic

1669
01:54:05.290 --> 01:54:09.959
bias in my research um that may distort them

1670
01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:13.950
the research processes. So, um I think all these

1671
01:54:13.959 --> 01:54:16.839
things have to be addressed, they must be addressed

1672
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:20.450
otherwise we end up uh running into the problem

1673
01:54:20.490 --> 01:54:25.890
that uh were no longer trustworthy. And after all,

1674
01:54:25.899 --> 01:54:29.720
I think uh science is always or doing research

1675
01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:33.919
is always a process of the best approximation where

1676
01:54:33.930 --> 01:54:38.450
we very often take wrong tracks along the way.

1677
01:54:38.479 --> 01:54:42.959
And very only occasionally we have a few breakthroughs.

1678
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:47.089
So I think we really need to continuously challenge

1679
01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:50.089
our own views and uh we have to question

1680
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.979
our pet hypothesis, although we might have grown fond

1681
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:56.669
of it. And um this would be the only

1682
01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:01.799
way how to make genuine advancements towards an understanding

1683
01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:03.240
how the human mind works.

1684
01:55:03.959 --> 01:55:06.569
Mhm Yeah. A and by the way, if I

1685
01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:09.930
may and, and if you disagree with something, I'm

1686
01:55:09.939 --> 01:55:12.299
about to say, please uh tell me. But I,

1687
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:14.930
if I may add, I just wanted to say

1688
01:55:14.939 --> 01:55:17.149
that I guess we have to keep in mind

1689
01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:22.229
that science is uh human institution. It's done by

1690
01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:28.490
humans, the scientific method or methods themselves are ever

1691
01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:32.509
evolving because as we develop new techniques, as we,

1692
01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:36.609
we uh discover new theoretical developments and so on

1693
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:39.950
the way science is done now is not the

1694
01:55:39.959 --> 01:55:42.910
way it was done 100 years ago and 100

1695
01:55:42.919 --> 01:55:46.189
years from now, it will be completely different for

1696
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.790
sure. And also I guess that there's a very

1697
01:55:50.799 --> 01:55:53.600
simple idea or at least you can put it

1698
01:55:53.609 --> 01:55:56.330
in simple terms, but it's more complex than it

1699
01:55:56.339 --> 01:56:00.680
seems that many people who are science communicators are

1700
01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.589
always uh s uh telling people about there is

1701
01:56:06.399 --> 01:56:11.049
and that uh there's no definitive truth in science,

1702
01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:16.470
truth is ever evolving. But sometimes curiously enough, uh,

1703
01:56:16.479 --> 01:56:20.450
scientists and people who are interested in science like

1704
01:56:20.459 --> 01:56:24.229
myself, uh uh I mean, sometimes we, uh we

1705
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.700
are tempted to treat certain discoveries in science like

1706
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:34.299
dogmas. And, uh curiously enough, uh, there are debates

1707
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:39.209
sometimes between scientists and religious people and they are

1708
01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.500
always telling the religious person, oh, you shouldn't trust

1709
01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.509
what the Bible says because that's dogma, that's just

1710
01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.750
a book and so on. And so for then

1711
01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:51.189
when it comes to some of their own pet

1712
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.220
hypothesis theories and so on, interestingly, it seems that

1713
01:56:56.350 --> 01:57:00.109
they are treating them like dogma like the religious

1714
01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.839
people do, which is also interesting because that makes

1715
01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:08.479
us closer perhaps to certain pseudo scientists or anti

1716
01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.939
scientists. Then we would like to admit at least

1717
01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:15.759
in certain cases because we are all human anyways.

1718
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:18.339
But I mean, I guess that's what I would

1719
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:20.419
like to add what you said.

1720
01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.140
I fully agree to it.

1721
01:57:24.759 --> 01:57:28.790
Ok. So Doctor Sarto Jackson, uh the book again

1722
01:57:28.799 --> 01:57:32.540
is the making and breaking of minds how social

1723
01:57:32.549 --> 01:57:35.339
interactions shape the human mind. I'm of course, leaving

1724
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:37.930
a link with the description box of the interview.

1725
01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:41.029
And would you like just to tell people before

1726
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:43.470

1727
01:57:43.479 --> 01:57:44.089
