00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.198
the Decent. I'm your host, as always Ricardo

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.730
Ops. And today I'm joined by Doctor Isabella Sarto

4
00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:11.019
Jackson. She is lecturer in Cognitive Science at the

5
00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:14.489
University of Vienna, guest lecturer in Cognitive Biology at

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.109
the University of Bratislava, Executive Manager of the Conrad

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.629
Lawrence Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research and president of

8
00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:27.129
the Austrian Neuroscience Association. And today we're focusing on

9
00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.318
her great book, The Making and Breaking of Minds

10
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.630
, How social interaction shaped the human mind. So

11
00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:37.899
, Doctor Sarto Jackson, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:41.569
It's an immense pleasure to everyone. Thank you very

13
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240
much Ricardo for having me. It's a great pleasure

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.770
to, to share my insights with you and uh

15
00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:50.959
hopefully everybody who's going to listen to this podcast.

16
00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:55.429
Thank you. So, I mean, we have

17
00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:59.000
lots of ground to cover here because there are many

18
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.829
, many things associated with how we approach the study

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.569
of the human mind, human psychology. But let's

20
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.010
start perhaps with uh DNA because as I read in

21
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:14.459
your book, that's also one of the places you

22
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.058
primarily came from and actually have already had many interviews

23
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.319
with, for example, behavior geneticists on the show

24
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.430
. And so, uh, particularly about these sort

25
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.668
of nature versus nurture debate and the focus that sometimes

26
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.349
we have on DNA or, mm, much of

27
00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.150
the time indeed we have on DNA. Do genes

28
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.109
really hold precise instructions to create a being with all

29
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.349
its, in this particular case, psychological traits.

30
00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:51.299
Mhm. Yeah. Thank you very much. Um

31
00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:53.808
, very important question. And, um, this

32
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.650
is something that, as you already said, um

33
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.359
, this, uh I, I started as a

34
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.219
geneticist, my master was in gen in genetics in

35
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.379
his genetics actually. And this is uh something I've

36
00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:09.288
been thinking about a lot. And uh actually,

37
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.210
um the beginning of my book um is dealing exactly

38
00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.939
with that topic. So, um one of the

39
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.058
things that I would like to start with is that

40
00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:28.929
um I have very strong doubts about this strict gene

41
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.699
deterministic way because it's very simplified. Uh and it's

42
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.419
especially unhelpful if we talk about the human brain or

43
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:43.909
cognitive processes because there we have so many causal factors

44
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.189
that underlie the organism and the human mind. So

45
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.460
this nature nurtured dichotomy is actually to my mind,

46
00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.210
some sort of obfuscation which has its historical roots in

47
00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:01.788
going back to the 17th century. Um it frames

48
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.349
nature in this very simplistic way we look at um

49
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.669
the DNA as if it holds the alive information.

50
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.830
Um And on the other hand, you have this

51
00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:20.889
environment which is completely separate from the organism. And

52
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.729
as we know, now this is much more intertwined

53
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.419
. So there is a dynamic interplay between genes and

54
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:31.710
environment and this interplay is mediated by the organism actually

55
00:03:31.758 --> 00:03:38.080
with its active involvement. So importantly, I would

56
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:42.689
say there is like reciprocal interaction between organism and environment

57
00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:45.069
. And from that point of view, it doesn't

58
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.080
make sense to s uh artificially separate bio, biological

59
00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:53.389
and environmental factors historically, that might have had benefits

60
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:59.669
to study um certain aspects. But I think it's

61
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.379
time to overcome this dichotomy. Mhm. But I

62
00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.379
, I mean, just to be fair here,

63
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.490
do you think that at least most behavior, geneticists

64
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.349
are really genetic determinist because, I mean, at

65
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.019
least with most people I talk with on the show

66
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.500
, uh, I, I guess that all of

67
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.269
them acknowledge the role of the, the, the

68
00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:25.420
role of the environment. Of course, they talk

69
00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:30.009
about heritability about twin study. Some of them put

70
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.600
a little bit more emphasis on genes, some of

71
00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:33.910
them a little bit more emphasis on the environment.

72
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.309
It also depends on the traits we're talking about.

73
00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.129
Right. But, II, I mean, uh

74
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.850
, do you agree that perhaps, uh, be

75
00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:46.019
more, at least most behavior geneticists do not tend

76
00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:51.225
to be, uh, genetic determines neither. II

77
00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:55.653
, I definitely agree because we've come a long way

78
00:04:55.665 --> 00:04:58.403
since. And of course, um, it was

79
00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:01.545
the geneticist who kind of disentangled a lot of factors

80
00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:05.165
and saw that there was a lot, uh missing

81
00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:09.923
in the picture. However, historically, keep in

82
00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:14.673
mind that it was um this, this uh behavioral

83
00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:17.225
genetics was always seen like a one way street.

84
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.798
So you had the genes that were kind of in

85
00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:26.079
control. And uh on the other hand, um

86
00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.519
you had uh environment separated. Um when we look

87
00:05:32.528 --> 00:05:36.269
at it, I think now, um then we

88
00:05:36.278 --> 00:05:40.129
have to acknowledge that there are at least three contributing

89
00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.850
factor that shape behavior. We have the variability that's

90
00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:47.678
within the gene in the genes in in the genome

91
00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.889
. Then we have a variability depending on environment,

92
00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.420
social environment, cultural environment. And then we have

93
00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:59.928
the variability in the phenotypic trait. And this and

94
00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.369
here, II, I fully agree by now,

95
00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:09.238
most acknowledge that phenotypic traits are polygenic and multifactorial.

96
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.959
Um Yeah. So, so maybe one more thing

97
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.358
is that uh one has to be very careful when

98
00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:21.278
thinking about um genes as they call that the most

99
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:28.220
important factors that um very often one also implies some

100
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.720
sort of causality. And that is misleading because uh

101
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:39.738
to disentangle um causality based on the genome versus the

102
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.399
environment, that's quite um a task that requires uh

103
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.358
much more than just looking at the, the um

104
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.528
at, at the underlying uh genetic sequences. Mhm

105
00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.928
A and of course, throughout our conversation, we're

106
00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.720
going to get into each of the specific factors that

107
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.209
play a role in our uh in the development of

108
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.319
our psychology. I mean, it's genes of course

109
00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:14.519
, but it's also gene expression. And apart from

110
00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:16.108
genetics. Again, we have the environment, we

111
00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:19.634
have the social context we have culture, we have

112
00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:21.704
, by the way, not just the brain but

113
00:07:21.713 --> 00:07:24.725
also the rest of the body. I guess we're

114
00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:27.144
going to talk about that as well. But ju

115
00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:30.254
just before we move on to this idea that you

116
00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:35.394
explain in the book of thinking about genetic susceptibility instead

117
00:07:35.403 --> 00:07:39.613
of genetic determinism just before we get into that.

118
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.329
So what do can we make of, for example

119
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:47.290
, uh twin studies and adoption studies? Because I

120
00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:50.379
mean, even though genes of course, are not

121
00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:56.559
the entire picture here, they still play some role

122
00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:58.428
. So what do you think? What would you

123
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.220
say is perhaps the informa the useful information we can

124
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:07.910
get from the twin and adoption? Yeah. So

125
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.350
, um again, um in the light of um

126
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.250
the history of how these studies have been um conceptualized

127
00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:22.678
and performed, they were really important in trying to

128
00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:30.220
disentangle uh nature versus nurture. Um especially because uh

129
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.139
most of the traditional studies like uh pedigree analysis or

130
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:41.509
genealogical methods, they um always assumed um that there

131
00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:46.859
was a bimodal distribution of in of traits within the

132
00:08:46.869 --> 00:08:52.379
population. Now with uh twin studies, um it

133
00:08:52.389 --> 00:09:00.700
was easier to um find um a good me or

134
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.080
to have a good method at hand uh to appraise

135
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.960
uh the hereditary environmental problem with respect to non bimodal

136
00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:13.668
characteristics, at least in theory. Um However,

137
00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:18.038
again, here we have the problem that also twin

138
00:09:18.048 --> 00:09:22.960
studies are phenotypic correlation studies. So, again,

139
00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:28.918
underlying causalities cannot be deducted from that. Um And

140
00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:33.349
um maybe the other thing that uh also have to

141
00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:39.700
has to be kept in mind is that um we

142
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.590
have to um also think uh about when, when

143
00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:50.168
doing these um association studies is uh to make sure

144
00:09:50.288 --> 00:09:54.969
uh that we control for confounding factors. And although

145
00:09:54.979 --> 00:09:58.739
twin studies of course, give a much better handle

146
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.460
to study uh this, this uh uh uh the

147
00:10:01.469 --> 00:10:07.320
, the, the um entanglement between or to disentangle

148
00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:11.629
um environment and, and um and biology. Um

149
00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:18.840
we should not forget that um also in twins,

150
00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:22.590
there is can be a lot of underlying confounding factors

151
00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:24.149
and they also have to be uh they, they're

152
00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:28.899
very often neglected. Um I'm aware that this has

153
00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:31.580
come a long way and of course, um it's

154
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.619
a lot more um it's uh there is much more

155
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:39.950
evidence now um for what you can study and what

156
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:45.700
, what uh what points cannot be elucidated. Um

157
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.158
Yeah. So importantly, maybe just as a final

158
00:10:48.168 --> 00:10:52.250
sentence is one of the most important recent outcomes from

159
00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:54.869
neurobiology is that even in twin studies, it has

160
00:10:54.879 --> 00:11:01.428
been shown that the anatomy of the brain varies relatively

161
00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:05.139
significantly. So, um there are some areas where

162
00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:09.269
it's perfect where we have perfect correlation with other areas

163
00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:13.619
. But there is some significant variation even between um

164
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:16.349
Moocs psychotic twins that have exactly the same genome.

165
00:11:18.548 --> 00:11:22.469
Mhm A and that of course, has to do

166
00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:24.408
. I would imagine when it comes to, for

167
00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:30.639
example, neonates with the fact that during brain development

168
00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:35.288
in the uterus, there are many stochastic events that

169
00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:39.489
play a role that we can't really entirely predict and

170
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.433
that are not predictable just by genes themselves. That's

171
00:11:45.445 --> 00:11:48.264
just one example. Right, then we also have

172
00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:52.734
levels of hormones and the ways by which perhaps uh

173
00:11:52.744 --> 00:11:58.033
neurons establish connections with one another that have to do

174
00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:01.673
with many different factors that are not entirely written in

175
00:12:01.683 --> 00:12:05.024
the genes neither. So there are many things like

176
00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:09.529
that that could lead even uh immediately after birth to

177
00:12:09.538 --> 00:12:16.330
two identical twins already having from the outset slightly different

178
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.619
uh brains. And then of course, as they

179
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:24.408
grow older as they have their unique life experiences and

180
00:12:24.418 --> 00:12:26.529
we're going to get into that later, of course

181
00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.599
, their brains become even more dissimilar. But those

182
00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:33.219
are some of the factors that play a role there

183
00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:35.210
. Right. Exactly. So, exactly what you're

184
00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:39.649
saying. So there is already a quite a significant

185
00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:45.210
degree of randomness um because the amount of genes that

186
00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:50.109
we have um even in considering all the splice variants

187
00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:52.149
and so on, they can never. Um So

188
00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:56.979
we're talking about maybe 22,000 genes. Um they can

189
00:12:56.989 --> 00:13:05.979
never um and program or give an exact blueprint of

190
00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:13.239
the connections of uh 86 billion neurons, let alone

191
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.558
uh 10 to the power of 15 synaptic connections.

192
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.649
So that would not be possible. Uh, and

193
00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:22.509
so, uh, I mean, what would genetic

194
00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:28.609
susceptibility mean here in the, in this particular context

195
00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:31.538
if we are rejecting the idea of genetic, uh

196
00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:37.700
, genetic determinism, which I think most people nowadays

197
00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:39.950
reject, uh, what would it mean to say

198
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.149
that perhaps, uh, there are some genetic susceptibility

199
00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:50.808
to developing certain particular traits? Mhm. Yeah,

200
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.830
that's, that's a very interesting question. And,

201
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.330
um, um, I just want to point out

202
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.269
that although I use susceptibility myself very often, uh

203
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:05.408
when it comes to development, I actually prefer um

204
00:14:05.418 --> 00:14:09.769
thinking about potentiality, thinking about what, what's,

205
00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:16.168
what is the underlying uh potential that the genes give

206
00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:20.200
us. So, whereas susceptibility has always this negative

207
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:26.629
connotation that is related to sensitivity like being predisposed to

208
00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.229
, for a drug or, or um to,

209
00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:31.690
to a disease or something. So, so what

210
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:37.668
is the susceptibility? This is kind of um a

211
00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:43.450
potential that is written in our genome um that allows

212
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.678
us to unfold uh certain traits. Um But this

213
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.710
very much depends on uh stimuli from the outside and

214
00:14:52.719 --> 00:14:56.293
that can be um the ecological environment, the social

215
00:14:56.303 --> 00:15:01.094
environment, there can be um factors that come even

216
00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:07.114
from just from the internal environment, like positional information

217
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:09.994
, depending you know, which place within the organism

218
00:15:11.004 --> 00:15:15.065
certain cells have. So basically, as I see

219
00:15:15.075 --> 00:15:18.683
it is we have uh a huge potential that's written

220
00:15:18.695 --> 00:15:22.548
in our genome and whether it's realized or not depends

221
00:15:22.558 --> 00:15:26.080
on very many factors and to be honest, there

222
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:35.019
is many, many more um uh information, let's

223
00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:39.119
say passive information um that is never realized because we

224
00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:41.899
just haven't got the environment for it. Um I

225
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:45.298
like to call it um a colleague of mine used

226
00:15:45.308 --> 00:15:46.349
to call it and I have taken that that phrase

227
00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:48.739
because I like it so much. Um That's uh

228
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.820
Darwin's hit the ink, you know, he's written

229
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.178
, it's written but in a yet invisible way and

230
00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.700
only being exposed to certain stimuli to certain environmental factors

231
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:06.558
, then the potential unfolds. Mhm A and when

232
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:11.340
it comes to the environment itself, I mean,

233
00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:15.460
how easy or hard is it to study the impact

234
00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:23.168
of specific environmental factors on human psychology and development?

235
00:16:23.178 --> 00:16:26.538
I mean, because of course, there's a myriad

236
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:32.038
of things happening around us at the same time and

237
00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:36.859
some of them might influences, some others do not

238
00:16:36.869 --> 00:16:37.769
influence us. But I, I mean, uh

239
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:41.359
uh how is your heart? Is it for us

240
00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:45.359
to really be able to know what aspects of the

241
00:16:45.369 --> 00:16:52.729
environment have an impact on human psychology? Well,

242
00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:55.719
yeah, that's a great question. And um here

243
00:16:55.729 --> 00:16:57.450
, I would like to draw a parallel to um

244
00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:02.840
to, to genome studies actually, when genome studies

245
00:17:02.849 --> 00:17:06.549
were set out, um originally, most of these

246
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:11.400
studies were dedicated to uh investigate individual genes. Like

247
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.789
I remember myself, I've been involved in projects where

248
00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:21.660
we knocked out individual genes in um in his strains

249
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.068
. So uh and then only with the advent of

250
00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:33.689
um different better methodologies and um more uh uh encompassing

251
00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:38.900
um techniques like than um the, the um genome

252
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:47.380
wide studies there. Um You got a different handle

253
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.039
on looking uh Ooo on many factors of many genes

254
00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:52.939
at the same time. Now, in parallel,

255
00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:59.598
when we now consider um the the environment, we

256
00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:03.380
, we're kind of uh almost at the beginning.

257
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.199
I no, not quite, but there is much

258
00:18:06.209 --> 00:18:10.078
. So we're lagging behind, we only took now

259
00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:12.568
the environment into the consideration. However, a lot

260
00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:17.439
has already been done um with studies coming from the

261
00:18:17.449 --> 00:18:22.729
expos. So what's interesting there is you take a

262
00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:26.229
lot of different factors, external factors that might be

263
00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.400
global factors or external factors, that might be very

264
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:36.118
specific or internal factors and all these factors together uh

265
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.789
might give you a more complete picture if you combine

266
00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:44.598
that with uh genome wide association studies. And moreover

267
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:48.529
, and that must not be forgotten, you take

268
00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:52.318
all this information, all this data. Um but

269
00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:56.588
you have to also follow the developmental trajectory because this

270
00:18:56.598 --> 00:19:00.729
is what makes the picture complete. So rather than

271
00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.469
taking a snapshot, look at the different stages of

272
00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:07.608
the ontogeny and there you get a more complete picture

273
00:19:07.618 --> 00:19:10.449
. So we do have quite a few techniques in

274
00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:11.750
our hands that will help us. But I think

275
00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:17.318
we're still quite at the beginning. Mhm And then

276
00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:22.640
there's also this phenomenon of organism, environment interactions,

277
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.150
right? It's not that uh even though I if

278
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.289
we are considering the environment and how it influences psychology

279
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:34.164
, it's not that we are just passive risk chapters

280
00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:37.733
of environmental influences. I mean, there's also a

281
00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:42.384
sort of dynamic interplay between the organism and the environment

282
00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:45.884
. And we are, we are like active agents

283
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.404
also playing a role and to some extent, shaping

284
00:19:49.414 --> 00:19:56.000
our own environment, right? Actually, uh Ricardo

285
00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:56.979
, if I may, you've already said the most

286
00:19:56.989 --> 00:20:00.130
important things that to my mind is. So um

287
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.759
there is not only this reciprocal interaction, but it

288
00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:08.838
is the organism that influences its own uh environment to

289
00:20:08.848 --> 00:20:15.118
make it uh the organism himself herself more are adapted

290
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.519
to its niche. Um And especially when we talk

291
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:22.588
about humans and our cognitive capacities, we are the

292
00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:27.009
paradigmatic niche constructors. So we are able to change

293
00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:30.930
our environment that it kind of very well suits us

294
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:34.078
. And that has been done for, for um

295
00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:41.809
our e en en entire evolutionary trajectory and we've be

296
00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:44.640
, and it's getting faster and faster now that might

297
00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.699
have bring different problems, however, but this is

298
00:20:47.709 --> 00:20:51.000
something so as you already said, so you've pointed

299
00:20:51.009 --> 00:20:56.549
out the most important uh points already. Um Yeah

300
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:59.809
. So, so, II I think uh it

301
00:20:59.818 --> 00:21:03.199
, it, it maybe one thing is when we

302
00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:06.549
take or we look at other um species, for

303
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:11.410
example, then you can see that there um the

304
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:17.239
the environment has a plethora of different effects. So

305
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:22.209
think about temperature, uh dependent sex determination in some

306
00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:27.989
organisms or population density dependent sex determination, others or

307
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.045
um predator induced um poly is um so all these

308
00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:37.634
things that have very specific outcomes that are studied in

309
00:21:37.644 --> 00:21:41.814
o other species uh in humans, we've got so

310
00:21:41.824 --> 00:21:45.814
many factors that can influence us uh on top of

311
00:21:45.824 --> 00:21:51.094
our very long uh development, childhood and adolescence development

312
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:56.390
. Um So the, the all these um selective

313
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.890
forces that can shape us um have a long,

314
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.559
long time to, to take its effect. Uh

315
00:22:03.568 --> 00:22:07.000
And I mean, we were talking about genes just

316
00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:10.219
a minute ago and even when it comes to genetic

317
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:11.799
evolution, I mean, now we have a broader

318
00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:15.848
framework of gene culture co evolution, right? And

319
00:22:15.858 --> 00:22:22.203
it's not just genetic evolution itself occurring, but we

320
00:22:22.213 --> 00:22:26.414
also have culture and culture itself might also influence how

321
00:22:26.424 --> 00:22:32.223
genetic evolution unfolds. And also the other way around

322
00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.814
. I mean, genetic evolution might also influence how

323
00:22:34.864 --> 00:22:40.750
I mean, how our culture develops or how attuned

324
00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:44.828
we are to certain aspects in our culture or the

325
00:22:44.838 --> 00:22:47.459
kinds of culture that we have in comparison to,

326
00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:51.769
for example, uh other cultural animals and so on

327
00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:53.439
. So we even there, there's all, there's

328
00:22:53.449 --> 00:23:00.640
also the sort of interplay between genes and the cultural

329
00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.219
environment, I guess. Yep. Yeah, you

330
00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:06.509
, you're absolutely right. So there is of course

331
00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:10.390
some classic examples of that what you've just mentioned like

332
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.910
um when um our ancestors starting to um uh keep

333
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.568
animals and uh used the milk. So we have

334
00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:26.049
uh this shift in our um our our ancestors had

335
00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:30.279
this shift in uh lactose tolerance um in humans.

336
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:34.279
So we have so many cultural processes that speed up

337
00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:40.618
or maybe even take over evolutionary uh pro natural evolutionary

338
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.420
, natural selection, uh biological evolutionary processes. And

339
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.130
a colleague or colleagues of mine have recently shown that

340
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:57.699
um because of medical interventions like um performing cesarean sections

341
00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:04.469
, um the evolutionary pressure that um is forced the

342
00:24:04.479 --> 00:24:10.549
human skull of a newborn to remain relatively small because

343
00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:12.150
it had to fit through the birth channel. This

344
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.118
pressure has been relieved now because of our medical interventions

345
00:24:17.318 --> 00:24:19.910
. So we really, with our cultural evolutionary processes

346
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.209
, we speed up um selection processes. Mhm A

347
00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:27.969
And by the way, I would like to get

348
00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:34.019
into this notion of neuroplasticity because uh I, I

349
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:37.420
mean, there was a period, I guess that

350
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.588
back in the early two thousands where we really had

351
00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:45.838
a very big hype surrounding neuroplasticity and that is sort

352
00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:48.368
of, but it in that it was going to

353
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.000
explain everything out there. But ii I mean,

354
00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:53.390
now we are perhaps to tune it down a little

355
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.229
bit and, and I would like to ask you

356
00:24:56.239 --> 00:25:00.618
so, neuroplasticity, what is really the role it

357
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:06.930
plays in the brain and brain development and what are

358
00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:11.209
its limits? Mhm OK. Yeah. So,

359
00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:15.209
neuroplasticity, this is a um a very exciting topic

360
00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:18.890
. Um So we have actually did the concept is

361
00:25:18.959 --> 00:25:22.568
is more than 100 years old. Santiago Ra Moni

362
00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:25.949
joal was um probably the first one, was the

363
00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:29.420
first one who described it. But then he kind

364
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.529
of because it was not um well accepted um by

365
00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:37.430
his colleagues. So he kind of um reduced it

366
00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:41.759
to the assumption that it only happens very, very

367
00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:45.729
early and and then the brain is no longer available

368
00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:48.858
. However, what we know now is that um

369
00:25:48.868 --> 00:25:52.910
there is a huge flexibility and neuroplasticity. So a

370
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.430
functional and a structural neuroplasticity, especially in the human

371
00:25:56.439 --> 00:25:57.828
brain. What is, what is this plasticity?

372
00:25:57.838 --> 00:26:00.160
Actually? This is, and this, this is

373
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:06.880
like a a reorganization um that um helps our brains

374
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.338
to adjust themselves within um an organism's lifespan and that

375
00:26:11.348 --> 00:26:18.108
helps to adjust or to adapt to the environmental experiences

376
00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:22.029
. Now looking at it from an evil evil.

377
00:26:22.118 --> 00:26:26.769
So evolutionary developmental perspective, it's actually neuroplasticity is just

378
00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:30.660
kind of an exploratory mechanism like um we have uh

379
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:36.900
similar forms um in um in, in other uh

380
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.769
organisms. Um So, what does this mean?

381
00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:45.910
So you have um you have me mechanisms that um

382
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:52.390
perform environmental sampling and um so they sample the environment

383
00:26:52.680 --> 00:27:00.108
and um get reinforced when a certain aspect of the

384
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:04.959
phenotype is um has a positive uh receives a positive

385
00:27:04.969 --> 00:27:10.519
stimulus. So a positive uh feedback. So,

386
00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:12.809
um and so, so as I said, this

387
00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:17.078
is actually uh an evil concept and in the brain

388
00:27:17.088 --> 00:27:18.660
you can see it and it has been studied very

389
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.900
thoroughly because it's so, so obvious that we have

390
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:29.989
this high abundance of um neuron uh uh connections.

391
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.650
So the synaptic connections in the first. So when

392
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.219
we spoke, I, I'm sticking now with humans

393
00:27:36.229 --> 00:27:38.605
in the first two years of age. So we

394
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:44.316
have this excess of synapses. And then um what

395
00:27:44.326 --> 00:27:48.306
happens then is you get uh pruning that depends on

396
00:27:48.316 --> 00:27:52.155
the external stimuli. So where is that the,

397
00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:55.526
the um the exuberant growth of the synaptic connections?

398
00:27:55.536 --> 00:28:00.066
This is largely genetically driven and also randomly um uh

399
00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:06.561
um fostered. But then what is actually stabilized,

400
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:11.260
which of the synapses remain and which um get lost

401
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.641
or, or um or are eliminated? Very much

402
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:18.421
depends on environmental stimuli coming up uh coming from the

403
00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:22.770
from, from the social and the physical environment,

404
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.171
cultural environment as well. So you have to use

405
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:30.199
it or lose it principle. Um So we have

406
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:33.880
some peaks as a childhood. There is another one

407
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.939
in um in adolescence that that's more of a recent

408
00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:41.509
finding. So we have a two really large peaks

409
00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:45.430
of rearrangement in the brain. Now, this is

410
00:28:45.439 --> 00:28:48.900
a huge potential again. Um There is cases I've

411
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.239
written about some of them in my book cases where

412
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.118
the brain really completely reorganizes itself. For example,

413
00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.750
cases of uh hemispherectomy where half of the brain.

414
00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:04.189
So one hemisphere has been surgically removed because of uh

415
00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:08.930
uh a severe illness. And uh this person almost

416
00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:14.078
fully recovered so could walk again, could speak again

417
00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:17.828
. Uh you made a college degree. So um

418
00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:21.828
the functional half of the brain took over the missing

419
00:29:21.838 --> 00:29:23.039
the function of the missing half of the brain.

420
00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:26.880
So it's a huge potential. However, and here

421
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.059
I agree with you, there has been a huge

422
00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:30.680
hype and not everything has been fulfilled. What,

423
00:29:30.689 --> 00:29:33.729
what was hoped for? So there are limitations and

424
00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:36.469
what are the limitations? First of all, it's

425
00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:38.989
age that this probably the biggest thing. So the

426
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.979
younger you are, the more malleable the brain is

427
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:45.818
of course. Um Second thing uh has also to

428
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:48.608
do with the brain region we're talking about. So

429
00:29:48.618 --> 00:29:52.890
, um what is some regions? Uh you can

430
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.920
see that in um in, in uh where,

431
00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:00.029
for example, there is a lot of neurogenesis going

432
00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:03.759
on hippocampus areas, a dag gyros or factory bulb

433
00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:06.699
uh maybe also in the cerebellum, they have a

434
00:30:06.709 --> 00:30:11.078
high um capacity of neuroplasticity. Uh Whereas in other

435
00:30:11.088 --> 00:30:15.160
regions and we see that in patients that suffer from

436
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.709
strokes, um other regions might be much more uh

437
00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:25.489
difficult uh to uh that there is some new cortic

438
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:27.750
mapping going on. So, so that's another thing

439
00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:32.979
, what else? Um things like neurotoxicity. So

440
00:30:32.989 --> 00:30:34.640
if you do damage to your own brain, for

441
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:40.680
example, by alcohol or your mother did by drinking

442
00:30:40.689 --> 00:30:42.390
alcohol while you were a fetus. So again,

443
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.309
there you, you kind of interfere and that are

444
00:30:45.568 --> 00:30:49.858
another really fascinating thing what has been shown is that

445
00:30:49.979 --> 00:30:56.598
um stress level, the amount of uh cortisol um

446
00:30:56.868 --> 00:31:00.890
interfere. So it is an antagonistic to um neuroplasticity

447
00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:03.588
. And last, but not least, of course

448
00:31:03.598 --> 00:31:07.189
, all sorts of um neurodegenerative diseases are kind of

449
00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:12.000
um uh that, that the inhibit or interfere with

450
00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:15.289
neuroplasticity. I'm sure there's many more other limits.

451
00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:17.989
But these, these are now on the top of

452
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.479
my head. So in the history of neuroscience,

453
00:31:23.489 --> 00:31:27.459
there have been two very dominant ideas. One of

454
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:30.118
them perhaps is more recent is more from, I

455
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.209
guess the seventies eighties somewhere like that. But I

456
00:31:34.219 --> 00:31:37.779
mean, the first one is localization is that is

457
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:41.769
the idea that there would be a 1 to 1

458
00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:47.969
mapping of brain areas and particular functional traits, including

459
00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:51.650
character traits that I think is the, the one

460
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.269
are the ones that we are mostly interested in here

461
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:59.289
because we are talking about uh human psychology and uh

462
00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:01.568
people's uh traits and so on. Uh I I

463
00:32:01.578 --> 00:32:07.368
mean, and then the other one is modularity of

464
00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.920
mind slash brain. And perhaps to some extent they

465
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.660
might be, I guess we could say a little

466
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.189
bit related because if we can, if we can

467
00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:22.189
find that certain functions are exclusive to certain particular brain

468
00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:27.368
areas, then the idea of modularity is just saying

469
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.545
that OK, so we have different modules across the

470
00:32:30.555 --> 00:32:36.775
brain that have evolved separately to serve certain functions.

471
00:32:36.785 --> 00:32:39.505
Perhaps the main argument here would be to serve certain

472
00:32:39.515 --> 00:32:45.314
evolved functions related to survival, reproduction and so on

473
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.250
it. I I mean, how do you look

474
00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:51.098
at, at these ideas? Do you think that

475
00:32:51.108 --> 00:32:54.818
they are still very dominant in neuroscience? Is there

476
00:32:54.828 --> 00:33:00.420
still some support to them or not so much?

477
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:05.289
Well, that's certainly interesting because um first of all

478
00:33:05.299 --> 00:33:07.750
, let me be a little bit provocative. Um

479
00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:13.739
because IIIM, my argument is that the localization list

480
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.150
view um is actually uh rooted in the legacy of

481
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.199
phrenology. I don't know if you can see.

482
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.979
Um y yes, I, I was actually already

483
00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:28.449
noticing it. So, so um of course,

484
00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:32.009
this is just provocative. Um And um we've come

485
00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:36.660
a long way since. Um so this still this

486
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:42.400
, this thinking of that you have different um areas

487
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:49.259
that are um distinct, um different traits can be

488
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:53.170
mapped to very um um distinct brain areas. Um

489
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:58.568
And that even goes for character trait, personality traits

490
00:33:58.709 --> 00:34:00.900
. So this is um this is something that,

491
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:07.199
that uh is to my mind largely overblown. However

492
00:34:07.209 --> 00:34:09.280
, however, uh when we look at the gross

493
00:34:09.289 --> 00:34:14.280
anatomy of the brain, then the localization list view

494
00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:15.628
is not wrong, right? Because I mean,

495
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:23.239
we know from uh from studies uh that individual case

496
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:29.510
studies um like that there is a relatively high reliability

497
00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:34.369
, not 100% never, but some areas that is

498
00:34:34.378 --> 00:34:37.208
so, so otherwise this whole brain maps of the

499
00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:42.751
brain atlas that that's now has been established by the

500
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.833
huge flagship ship EU project wouldn't make sense. So

501
00:34:45.842 --> 00:34:50.612
there is to a good degree there is localization,

502
00:34:50.623 --> 00:34:53.311
especially when we talk about the soma motor cortex or

503
00:34:53.322 --> 00:34:57.413
somatosensory cortex and so on that, like defined by

504
00:34:57.461 --> 00:35:00.492
Wilder Penfield. So there is um I I'm not

505
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:05.726
disputing that however, an ex extreme localization list uh

506
00:35:05.735 --> 00:35:09.125
view of functions is almost certainly wrong because this would

507
00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:14.476
go completely against neuroplasticity. And actually, including while

508
00:35:14.485 --> 00:35:16.295
the Penfield already like more than uh I don't know

509
00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:20.416
, 70 years ago, he already saw that there

510
00:35:20.425 --> 00:35:22.976
are some overlapping zones and this is not like a

511
00:35:22.985 --> 00:35:28.429
clear cut module now. Um And another thing that

512
00:35:28.438 --> 00:35:31.228
would also kind of argue against it, not only

513
00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:37.050
the neuroplastic um uh uh argument, I've just broadened

514
00:35:37.059 --> 00:35:39.349
, which we touched upon previously. Also, um

515
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.860
you can have brain damage in different, in,

516
00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:46.789
in different patients at the same position and they have

517
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.708
very different symptoms. So also that would argue against

518
00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:55.648
it. Now, um what makes the real big

519
00:35:55.659 --> 00:36:02.128
difference is uh of course, the um micro anatomy

520
00:36:02.139 --> 00:36:07.090
, how the synaptic connections are then established as we've

521
00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:08.688
already seen uh in terms of dis use it or

522
00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:12.280
lose it. Now, in answer to your question

523
00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:16.030
, how does it relate to brain modules? Well

524
00:36:16.929 --> 00:36:21.869
, one thing that comes to my mind is that

525
00:36:21.878 --> 00:36:27.610
in, in case of um evolutionary psychology and um

526
00:36:27.668 --> 00:36:30.119
and this uh view of, of um very clear

527
00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:35.820
cut uh brain modules, then there's always this debate

528
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:38.429
that a lot of it is innate, if not

529
00:36:38.438 --> 00:36:43.188
all you develop. Um Of course, you develop

530
00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.949
, you're not born with it, you develop it

531
00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:46.344
. But if you develop it, that comes due

532
00:36:46.353 --> 00:36:49.914
to do some input from the environment, but it's

533
00:36:49.925 --> 00:36:52.164
still always the module will be uh roughly at the

534
00:36:52.175 --> 00:36:54.135
same time. Or however, there is also a

535
00:36:54.144 --> 00:37:00.253
different uh interpretation. Um coming from the sparseness concept

536
00:37:00.264 --> 00:37:02.844
, it might not even be anatomically exactly the same

537
00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:06.954
position. But yet you have like a sparse network

538
00:37:06.965 --> 00:37:08.918
that always kind of gives you a module. Now

539
00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:13.800
, this is much more difficult to disprove um what

540
00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:15.728
I can as to my mind from, from uh

541
00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:22.260
w what WW what uh I I see um coming

542
00:37:22.269 --> 00:37:28.449
from the Neurosciences is that yes, there is modularity

543
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:30.648
. Yes, gross anatomy is relatively reliable. You

544
00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:35.409
can do these brain maps. Um However, this

545
00:37:35.418 --> 00:37:40.559
massive modularity hypothesis that with these highly specialized models like

546
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:44.909
uh Swiss army knife that is to my mind uh

547
00:37:44.918 --> 00:37:50.139
has the most neuroscientists have moved away from that.

548
00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:52.849
So, yeah, that, that's my take on

549
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.119
that. Uh Also uh one of the reasons why

550
00:37:55.128 --> 00:37:59.188
I wanted to ask you about that actually. And

551
00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:04.099
you mentioned evolutionary psychology there and yes, massive modularity

552
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.438
of the human mind is and a big idea in

553
00:38:07.449 --> 00:38:10.398
evolutionary psychology, specifically, not, not exclusively,

554
00:38:10.409 --> 00:38:13.918
I guess, but yes, specifically there uh it

555
00:38:13.929 --> 00:38:16.159
, but since we talked about genes at the beginning

556
00:38:16.168 --> 00:38:20.878
of our conversation, sometimes it seems to me that

557
00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:24.969
uh not just the modularity of mind idea, but

558
00:38:24.978 --> 00:38:30.409
also some of these localization is thinking as some parallels

559
00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:35.429
with gene centric views of psychology in the way,

560
00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:37.840
in a way that I mean, sometimes you hear

561
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:43.958
evolutionary psychologists, for example, claim that they uh

562
00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:51.340
the neonate brain sort of harbors innate cognitive modules that

563
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:57.219
come equipped with contents that are specified in the genetic

564
00:38:57.228 --> 00:39:00.929
makeup. I mean, something along those lines,

565
00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:04.478
right? And so uh we would have ii I

566
00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:07.199
think that the term, the correct term here would

567
00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:14.559
be information processing mechanisms that are innate and that are

568
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:19.219
again specified in the genetic makeup. And uh and

569
00:39:19.228 --> 00:39:22.809
that are associated with these or that different kind of

570
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.579
brain or mind module. So, uh I,

571
00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:28.389
I guess that this is the idea but, but

572
00:39:28.398 --> 00:39:30.760
basically, what I'm asking you here is if you

573
00:39:30.769 --> 00:39:37.369
agree that uh this sort of modularity localization is idea

574
00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:42.769
sometimes links to gene centric views of human psychology.

575
00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:46.389
Definitely, I, I very much appreciate this point

576
00:39:46.398 --> 00:39:50.668
um with that, that you highlight that actually,

577
00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:52.840
I, I see it in a very similar light

578
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:59.898
. So um there is this kind of idea of

579
00:39:59.909 --> 00:40:02.938
um innateness that has a little bit of a touch

580
00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:08.360
of prema formation is so that you have already all

581
00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:12.489
the information is already there and you just need to

582
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.168
unfold it, you know, but it, it

583
00:40:14.179 --> 00:40:19.168
is already there. And um II I think uh

584
00:40:19.179 --> 00:40:22.119
I mean, the the truth is always probably somewhere

585
00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:23.610
in the middle, it's not completely wrong. Of

586
00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:27.329
course, I mean, there is good evidence also

587
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.099
for some of these claims. However, as I

588
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:34.688
see, it is um you, you have these

589
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:42.469
predispositions coming from genes um and they give uh some

590
00:40:42.478 --> 00:40:44.708
kind of a kickstart, they give you uh a

591
00:40:44.719 --> 00:40:51.320
guiding um expression and then it is the development.

592
00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:55.659
So uh that uh that, so that or let

593
00:40:55.668 --> 00:40:58.949
me say, say like this, that um you

594
00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:02.869
have a predisposition and that provides then a substrate for

595
00:41:02.878 --> 00:41:07.539
the developmental processes to operate. So, and I

596
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.438
think this is where it comes from. It is

597
00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:12.639
not completely wrong. But um yeah, and,

598
00:41:12.648 --> 00:41:14.996
and I agree on the parallel which you pointed out

599
00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.614
. So II, I think yes, this innateness

600
00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:21.375
concept has smacks very much of pre formation is,

601
00:41:22.585 --> 00:41:22.706
yeah. And I, and I mean, I

602
00:41:22.715 --> 00:41:25.775
don't know if you agree with this point specifically,

603
00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:30.574
but I guess that you use the word predisposition there

604
00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:34.034
instead of thinking about in terms of innateness, I

605
00:41:34.045 --> 00:41:36.344
guess. And I, I would imagine that,

606
00:41:36.355 --> 00:41:38.894
yeah, there's, I think good evidence that perhaps

607
00:41:38.971 --> 00:41:45.210
we are born with some predispositions to, for example

608
00:41:45.221 --> 00:41:50.271
, pay attention to certain information in our environment,

609
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.592
particularly the social environment. For example, I don't

610
00:41:52.601 --> 00:41:55.391
know, look at people's faces and try to gather

611
00:41:55.402 --> 00:42:00.831
information from them. And perhaps some aspects of language

612
00:42:00.842 --> 00:42:06.320
might also be predisposition and stuff like that. Uh

613
00:42:06.329 --> 00:42:09.648
But then perhaps the idea that's wrong here is to

614
00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:17.539
think that uh those predispositions are like uh fixed and

615
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:24.458
the underlying informational processing, mech information processing mechanisms cannot

616
00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:30.579
be changed at all or are impermeable to culture and

617
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.244
to all kinds of environment inputs. I mean,

618
00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:37.324
does this ring through or? Yeah, that definitely

619
00:42:37.445 --> 00:42:39.474
. So you you touched upon a really, really

620
00:42:39.485 --> 00:42:44.764
important point here because what's completely left out in the

621
00:42:44.773 --> 00:42:51.094
whole debate um about modernity is um the the concept

622
00:42:51.103 --> 00:42:54.739
of the idea of acceptation and especially the human mind

623
00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:00.030
with all our cultural evolution, we have um a

624
00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:02.050
lot of what, what our brain does, what

625
00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:07.599
the human mind does is falls in the domain of

626
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.099
acceptation. So what is that? So we have

627
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:16.840
certain brain regions maybe um that have evolved for some

628
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:22.849
specific adapt adaptive purposes. But then they have been

629
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:28.969
report purposed hijacked. You mentioned the example of um

630
00:43:29.438 --> 00:43:32.849
attention focusing, visually focusing. Um I think social

631
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.610
stimuli and so on. Now, obviously, our

632
00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:40.079
visual senses are very good. Now, um our

633
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:45.929
culture has evolved to uh that we, we use

634
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:47.820
writing and would be we're able to, to read

635
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:53.168
and write. So most certainly don't have an innate

636
00:43:53.179 --> 00:43:59.250
mo module for learning to read. So this is

637
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.918
an acceptation. So this was most likely uh a

638
00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:07.360
region that has been adapted to uh uh uh uh

639
00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:13.719
um pattern recognition, pattern completion and that has then

640
00:44:13.728 --> 00:44:16.750
been used for different purpose for reading. Yeah.

641
00:44:17.159 --> 00:44:21.579
And that doesn't sit well with evolutionary uh with,

642
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.898
with um the massive modernity hypothesis. Definitely. Mhm

643
00:44:25.398 --> 00:44:28.579
And so one topic that I would like to get

644
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.820
into now is of course, when it comes to

645
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:36.500
human psychology, at least in our modern societies,

646
00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:42.179
uh we also have a medical approach to it and

647
00:44:42.188 --> 00:44:47.000
we, and we use terms like uh normal development

648
00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:51.500
, normal psychology. We, we, we,

649
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.728
we use terms like mental disorder, mental condition and

650
00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:59.739
a mental disease and something and stuff like that.

651
00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:01.449
So, uh do, do you think, I

652
00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:07.519
mean, when it comes to thinking about what normal

653
00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:13.398
might mean in the context of uh developmental psychology,

654
00:45:13.789 --> 00:45:15.769
what do you think are perhaps some of the issues

655
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.519
with that, with, with thinking that there's a

656
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:27.458
normal way for human psychology to develop. And if

657
00:45:27.469 --> 00:45:30.539
uh a person, for example, somewhat deviates from

658
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:36.030
that normal pathway, then there must be something wrong

659
00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:38.438
with them. Yeah, this is again, a

660
00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:42.199
very, very important question and topic. You,

661
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:45.510
you, you, you, you're uh pointing out

662
00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:49.570
. So um to my mind and I've, I've

663
00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:55.110
written uh about it. Um this idea of normal

664
00:45:55.159 --> 00:46:00.708
has its roots in mechanistic thinking. So we see

665
00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:04.369
and that again, go goes back, I always

666
00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:06.550
kind of uh see a little bit of the historical

667
00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:09.128
components. Yeah. Uh that goes back even to

668
00:46:09.139 --> 00:46:14.219
, to Rene de K and um who saw the

669
00:46:14.228 --> 00:46:15.949
body as, as like the mindless machine, you

670
00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:22.000
know, and um in this view, we have

671
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.898
a view, uh we have a conception of a

672
00:46:23.909 --> 00:46:30.110
healthy body like a machine that runs error free.

673
00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:35.769
This is not only a huge simplification, let alone

674
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.159
that, but it has also other consequences. First

675
00:46:39.168 --> 00:46:45.510
of all, um it assumes that there is something

676
00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:47.110
that is fixable, there is something that must be

677
00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:52.469
a standard uh uh a way how it should work

678
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.550
, um an optimal way how it should work.

679
00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:57.610
And if we fix that, just, you know

680
00:46:57.619 --> 00:47:00.559
, turn on this um screw or, or,

681
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:05.179
or change this little button, then we can um

682
00:47:05.188 --> 00:47:07.679
we can all of a sudden uh put the person

683
00:47:07.688 --> 00:47:10.800
back into being normal again, re establishing normalcy.

684
00:47:12.148 --> 00:47:15.250
That has a lot to do. Also with how

685
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:21.438
the current um psychopharmacology, uh pharmacology in general looks

686
00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:23.199
at the brain, you know that there's something out

687
00:47:23.208 --> 00:47:28.320
of balance, you change something, you turn some

688
00:47:28.329 --> 00:47:30.510
wheel and all of a sudden you imbalance against this

689
00:47:30.519 --> 00:47:36.030
is this has problematic consequences. It also has societal

690
00:47:36.039 --> 00:47:37.519
consequences. We might want to speak about that.

691
00:47:37.909 --> 00:47:42.478
And last, but not least is it makes us

692
00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:45.958
really overconfident because we can capture the complexity of a

693
00:47:45.969 --> 00:47:49.809
machine. So we might think, oh yeah,

694
00:47:50.148 --> 00:47:52.590
we might be able, you know, to have

695
00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:55.269
pumps like pumps blood like an old pump. So

696
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.500
we must be able to fix that and we completely

697
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:06.369
neglect um these multi scale properties and systemic properties um

698
00:48:06.445 --> 00:48:08.425
which might, you know, have even and I'm

699
00:48:08.434 --> 00:48:12.583
touching on a very hot topic here, which might

700
00:48:12.594 --> 00:48:14.353
not be true, but we might even be talking

701
00:48:14.364 --> 00:48:17.224
about bottom up and top down causation. So,

702
00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:22.043
so um all these things which you will never find

703
00:48:22.054 --> 00:48:23.938
in a machine. So, uh I mean,

704
00:48:23.949 --> 00:48:29.340
about this medical context and how we think about psychopathology

705
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:31.019
, there are many things we could talk about here

706
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:35.418
. I mean, just when it comes to simple

707
00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:38.628
classification and the DS M for example, um in

708
00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:43.840
2022 I had an entire interview with Doctor Ellen Oritz

709
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:46.199
and we got into the huge mess that is the

710
00:48:46.208 --> 00:48:51.315
history of the DS M. The classification of mental

711
00:48:51.324 --> 00:48:57.284
disorders changed drastically over the decades for reasons that have

712
00:48:57.295 --> 00:49:00.315
sometimes very little to do with science. So that's

713
00:49:00.324 --> 00:49:02.016
already a problem in and of itself. But uh

714
00:49:02.025 --> 00:49:05.565
I would like to ask you about the specific,

715
00:49:05.574 --> 00:49:07.304
very interesting thing that I read about in your book

716
00:49:07.315 --> 00:49:10.956
that is Looping Effects. And I'm, I'm,

717
00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:15.690
and I'm going to uh quote you here. This

718
00:49:15.701 --> 00:49:21.931
is basically how the verbal discourse about certain psychopathological or

719
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:27.690
psychological phenomena impacts on how this very phenomenon is framed

720
00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.181
theorized experience and treated. So, I mean,

721
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:37.581
it seems that also the way we uh theorize and

722
00:49:37.592 --> 00:49:44.579
classify disorders and study them itself might have an effect

723
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:49.619
on how we think about them and then reinforce,

724
00:49:49.628 --> 00:49:52.739
I guess, I guess, to some extent uh

725
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:59.590
their own uh existence. Yep. So, yeah

726
00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.110
, you, you, you uh summarized it very

727
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:05.590
nicely. The concept actually comes from Ian hacking.

728
00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:10.369
And um this is uh I think it's important because

729
00:50:10.378 --> 00:50:15.849
it is um a uh a way of looking at

730
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:21.188
um pathologies, especially psychopathologies uh in a way that

731
00:50:21.199 --> 00:50:23.969
may be able to bridge the normative and the naturalist

732
00:50:23.978 --> 00:50:29.349
conceptions. So, um what's at stake here?

733
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.148
So if this is true, if this loop looping

734
00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:37.750
uh effects exist, um and we classify doctors,

735
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.719
psychologists, psychiatrists classify people in a certain way,

736
00:50:40.969 --> 00:50:45.878
then people may conform to the way how this pathology

737
00:50:45.889 --> 00:50:50.628
is described. So it opens up a space that

738
00:50:50.639 --> 00:50:54.628
they can um express symptoms in a socially accepted way

739
00:50:54.909 --> 00:50:58.469
. And at the same time, it has this

740
00:50:58.478 --> 00:51:04.719
kind of um components that it might lead to um

741
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.628
a self fulfilling prophecy because this is the way how

742
00:51:07.639 --> 00:51:10.668
you expect to behave or the symptoms you expect to

743
00:51:10.898 --> 00:51:14.449
um to, to express. So, yeah,

744
00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:19.429
this is um I found it interesting in uh relation

745
00:51:19.438 --> 00:51:24.438
to uh studies how Children when they were maltreated again

746
00:51:24.449 --> 00:51:29.909
over history. What happened? Uh It gives um

747
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:36.949
it, it almost uh absorbs uh uh the parents

748
00:51:36.958 --> 00:51:40.708
from their responsibilities when you look at a pathology and

749
00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:44.110
then you will say, yeah, but um can't

750
00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:45.269
do anything about it. And this is how the

751
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.418
the child is like this and the child will act

752
00:51:49.429 --> 00:51:53.889
out in this way. So um Ian hacking actually

753
00:51:53.898 --> 00:51:59.570
used a sync uh a DH D as a modern

754
00:51:59.579 --> 00:52:01.550
day, a contemporary example of the looping effect.

755
00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:07.769
So, you know, uh and interestingly um might

756
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.929
be very much depending on, on cultural inputs,

757
00:52:10.938 --> 00:52:14.949
what do you expect from how a person behaves?

758
00:52:14.958 --> 00:52:19.148
And another example is of course, uh hysteria that

759
00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:22.869
, that um disappeared in fro from, from uh

760
00:52:22.878 --> 00:52:27.409
from the, the DS M for example. Um

761
00:52:27.708 --> 00:52:30.070
So, so yeah, I, I think um

762
00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:34.070
this looping effect has a lot of potential to um

763
00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:39.628
explain why some of the pathologies um come and go

764
00:52:39.639 --> 00:52:45.148
and why some of these pathologies express symptoms of patients

765
00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:49.559
with these pathologies express certain symptoms at a certain given

766
00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.030
time in history and then they don't anymore. So

767
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.389
it has something to do with the social acceptance.

768
00:52:55.849 --> 00:53:00.619
A and also there are very particular examples, some

769
00:53:00.628 --> 00:53:06.668
of their very unfortunate historical examples like the case of

770
00:53:06.679 --> 00:53:12.599
homosexuality, right? Which in not very long ago

771
00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.789
, it was considered a mental disorder. And I

772
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:21.728
mean, with scientific progress and with people who were

773
00:53:21.739 --> 00:53:25.449
themselves almost sexual, expressing their own views and social

774
00:53:25.458 --> 00:53:28.530
movements and all of that, I mean, it

775
00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:34.489
has been fortunately normalized across many societies, not everywhere

776
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.519
, unfortunately, but across many societies and it's no

777
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:43.599
longer considered the medical condition. But I I mean

778
00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:45.458
, it, it, that's, that's I guess

779
00:53:45.469 --> 00:53:51.039
a very clear example of something that was medicalized,

780
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:58.389
considered an anomaly just on a cultural normative and moral

781
00:53:58.398 --> 00:54:01.800
grounds, basically because people uh to put it in

782
00:54:01.809 --> 00:54:06.289
the simplest terms, possible, didn't like that kind

783
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.809
of behavior. Right. Exactly. So th this

784
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.599
is here, you, you pointed out this is

785
00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.378
uh there was this very, very strong normative component

786
00:54:15.389 --> 00:54:22.398
to it and um that there is always a walk

787
00:54:22.409 --> 00:54:29.860
on the tightrope um about um s to patho pathologize

788
00:54:29.869 --> 00:54:31.869
symptoms versus to help people. So obviously, you

789
00:54:31.878 --> 00:54:36.869
want to uh help people. Uh But in some

790
00:54:36.878 --> 00:54:39.659
cases, um there is no, no help required

791
00:54:39.668 --> 00:54:44.228
as in case of homosexuality, this is was a

792
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:50.340
purely normative um uh decision. And uh here uh

793
00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:55.228
you pathologize um a normal variation within the human population

794
00:54:55.889 --> 00:55:00.199
. Mhm Yeah. A and so, uh I

795
00:55:00.208 --> 00:55:01.000
, I mean, at a certain point there,

796
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:05.398
you also mentioned when we were talking about how we

797
00:55:05.409 --> 00:55:10.208
think about normalcy, uh the fact that uh nowadays

798
00:55:10.219 --> 00:55:15.989
it seems that we are uh like bio biologs.

799
00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:20.409
I mean, relying much on the biological aspect of

800
00:55:20.418 --> 00:55:22.958
things when thinking about certain disorders. I mean,

801
00:55:22.969 --> 00:55:29.148
trying to find specific genes, specific brain regions that

802
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.610
might be malfunctioning and that would explain, I don't

803
00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:37.090
know, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and all of

804
00:55:37.099 --> 00:55:39.219
that. But I, I mean, shouldn't we

805
00:55:39.228 --> 00:55:47.260
have moved already past the simple biological or re reductionist

806
00:55:47.269 --> 00:55:51.378
way of looking at things? I mean, shouldn't

807
00:55:51.389 --> 00:55:54.889
uh don't we have at this time already a bio

808
00:55:55.929 --> 00:56:00.458
psychosocial model of, of human psychology and also I

809
00:56:00.469 --> 00:56:07.239
guess adding to that uh an individual's own history to

810
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:12.179
consider. Yeah. Um I see your point.

811
00:56:12.188 --> 00:56:16.059
However, what is extremely tempting about this. Um

812
00:56:16.458 --> 00:56:20.860
And I'm uh uh I, I also think it's

813
00:56:20.869 --> 00:56:23.039
, it's largely reductionist, but it does not necessarily

814
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:28.139
have to be reductionist if, if you stay looking

815
00:56:28.148 --> 00:56:30.750
just at the biological parameters. But the exciting and

816
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:36.070
interesting thing about doing that and focusing on the biological

817
00:56:36.079 --> 00:56:40.019
parameters is that the um they are quantifiable, they

818
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:45.780
are measurable. And this is something that conveys objectivity

819
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:51.510
. This is much easier to sell to work with

820
00:56:51.539 --> 00:56:55.128
than our messy environments where you were, where you

821
00:56:55.139 --> 00:57:00.969
take other theories that draw from seemingly soft sciences that

822
00:57:00.978 --> 00:57:04.989
have qualitative approaches and so on. So this is

823
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.878
what we still, in some cases, rely on

824
00:57:07.889 --> 00:57:10.809
some on, on uh Christopher Bo's biostatistical theory.

825
00:57:10.878 --> 00:57:17.929
Although especially with psychopathologies, there is hardly any um

826
00:57:17.938 --> 00:57:24.429
objective parameter that we can specify um in terms of

827
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:30.340
what is normal in a given uh population versus where

828
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:32.418
is, where is a deviation that leads to these

829
00:57:32.429 --> 00:57:37.489
and uh those uh symptoms of uh pathologies. So

830
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.250
I, I think that the appeal is simply because

831
00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:44.708
it's measurable and we have techniques that can be exploited

832
00:57:44.719 --> 00:57:47.438
for that. Yeah. Mhm. Uh So do

833
00:57:47.449 --> 00:57:53.159
you think that when it comes to understanding how psychological

834
00:57:53.168 --> 00:57:59.250
traits work, how they develop through time that perhaps

835
00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:06.050
a framework like dynamical systems theory would apply here and

836
00:58:06.059 --> 00:58:13.329
would be perhaps a more uh closer to the reality

837
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:17.610
of human psychology than some other, let's say reductionist

838
00:58:17.719 --> 00:58:22.079
views out there, like trying to biolog or reduce

839
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:29.570
everything to simple biological factors like genes, hormones,

840
00:58:29.579 --> 00:58:34.728
neurotransmitters, brain networks and, and stuff like that

841
00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:37.619
. Mhm. Yep. That's a very good point

842
00:58:37.628 --> 00:58:39.168
. Um And again, I agree. Um So

843
00:58:39.179 --> 00:58:44.340
I think we're thinking along similar lines. Um We

844
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:46.128
don't, we, we don't have a strong controversy

845
00:58:46.148 --> 00:58:49.590
yet. So II, I do agree. Um

846
00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:53.179
I think actually it would be very helpful to shift

847
00:58:53.289 --> 00:58:59.349
towards um complex system theory because with all the reductionist

848
00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:05.918
approaches, we're completely letting uh uh setting aside um

849
00:59:05.929 --> 00:59:09.760
the relations among these different complexes and components in the

850
00:59:09.769 --> 00:59:16.539
complex and disregard sort of systemic qualities. And um

851
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:20.239
yeah, so this is, this is a really

852
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.659
important point. Um However, um there, these

853
00:59:24.668 --> 00:59:27.699
are, you know, you, you, you

854
00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:32.360
harvest usually the low hanging fruits first. So I

855
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:36.789
think we're getting there, the field is moving.

856
00:59:37.458 --> 00:59:42.309
But um there is still i it's funding is still

857
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.148
, there is still a lot of funding and,

858
00:59:44.159 --> 00:59:47.429
and still a lot of money in uh using the

859
00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:52.090
more traditional approaches and some of them still may have

860
00:59:52.099 --> 00:59:55.610
merits. Um Yeah, but, but I think

861
00:59:55.619 --> 00:59:59.949
the next big lipo step has to be to look

862
00:59:59.958 --> 00:60:01.438
uh look at the organism from a systemic view point

863
00:60:01.449 --> 00:60:04.938
of view. I agree. And of course,

864
00:60:04.949 --> 00:60:07.320
I guess that in this case, this is not

865
00:60:07.329 --> 00:60:10.208
at all to say that uh things like genes or

866
00:60:10.219 --> 00:60:15.188
hormones or neurotransmitters do not matter at all. I

867
00:60:15.199 --> 00:60:16.590
mean, they, they play, they certainly play

868
00:60:16.599 --> 00:60:21.099
their role. It's just the fact that perhaps we

869
00:60:21.110 --> 00:60:23.668
have to think about our psychology as more of a

870
00:60:23.679 --> 00:60:30.099
dynamic system and the rates as not really uh fixed

871
00:60:30.110 --> 00:60:36.780
things that uh that uh change and fluctuate over time

872
00:60:36.789 --> 00:60:38.860
in this or that direction uh and the same,

873
00:60:38.958 --> 00:60:44.418
I guess would apply to mental disorders. Right.

874
00:60:45.070 --> 00:60:47.449
Yeah, I agree. And just um going back

875
00:60:47.458 --> 00:60:52.449
to something I said earlier, um with respect to

876
00:60:52.458 --> 00:60:57.889
the expose on when we look at um genome wide

877
00:60:57.898 --> 00:61:01.820
association studies related to the expos on to expos studies

878
00:61:01.829 --> 00:61:07.128
, then it would be really important to look at

879
00:61:07.139 --> 00:61:09.659
all the developmental components that are involved and the whole

880
00:61:09.668 --> 00:61:14.050
trajectory of the development. So, uh as you

881
00:61:14.059 --> 00:61:19.398
rightly said, um it's not uh you know,

882
00:61:19.409 --> 00:61:24.000
it's not fix, but um Conran Waddington called it

883
00:61:24.010 --> 00:61:28.119
homo races. So, rather than having um the

884
00:61:28.128 --> 00:61:30.938
concept of just homeostasis with a set point where you

885
00:61:30.969 --> 00:61:34.110
, where the organism goes back to a set,

886
00:61:34.260 --> 00:61:37.398
it is the, the trajectory that is followed,

887
00:61:37.409 --> 00:61:44.250
not an individual set point. Conrad Weddington uh is

888
00:61:44.260 --> 00:61:47.010
the one also related to the idea of the epigenetic

889
00:61:47.019 --> 00:61:52.918
landscape. Absolutely. Right. Yeah. And so

890
00:61:52.929 --> 00:61:58.188
uh another thing that perhaps nowadays upsets many people,

891
00:61:58.199 --> 00:62:00.239
but I guess that we should also mention this when

892
00:62:00.250 --> 00:62:05.769
it comes to environment and social relations. Isn't it

893
00:62:05.780 --> 00:62:10.840
also important to consider here? Things like socio-economic structures

894
00:62:10.849 --> 00:62:15.188
, systemic discrimination based on gender, race or any

895
00:62:15.199 --> 00:62:20.840
other kind of social category and other sorts of social

896
00:62:21.099 --> 00:62:27.110
uh categories, identities and related factors. But yeah

897
00:62:27.329 --> 00:62:30.889
, um very, very good point. Um So

898
00:62:30.679 --> 00:62:35.340
talking about socio-economic structures, I think there has already

899
00:62:35.349 --> 00:62:39.340
been quite some good work done. And um there

900
00:62:39.349 --> 00:62:44.269
is, there is uh animal model studies but also

901
00:62:44.280 --> 00:62:47.840
correlation studies in humans where uh it has been shown

902
00:62:49.010 --> 00:62:52.168
that um I think Michael Meany, for example,

903
00:62:52.179 --> 00:62:54.719
uh did, did something in this direction and other

904
00:62:54.728 --> 00:63:00.648
colleagues uh also um looked at um what was the

905
00:63:00.659 --> 00:63:07.389
um what's the effect of um growing up in poverty

906
00:63:07.878 --> 00:63:10.750
? And it has been shown that the, the

907
00:63:10.760 --> 00:63:15.260
level of uh some components of the uh stress axis

908
00:63:15.360 --> 00:63:21.070
or stress response axis, like cortisol and like ac

909
00:63:21.079 --> 00:63:24.735
th they are increased very early already in, in

910
00:63:24.744 --> 00:63:29.954
uh you could see a difference um already in Children

911
00:63:29.965 --> 00:63:31.695
of the age of six years and by the age

912
00:63:31.704 --> 00:63:36.414
of 10 years, they have um the, the

913
00:63:36.425 --> 00:63:40.175
, the the le level of cortisol has already doubled

914
00:63:40.184 --> 00:63:43.784
. So I mean, this is really significant.

915
00:63:44.144 --> 00:63:47.965
Um Of course, we might discuss whether this is

916
00:63:47.974 --> 00:63:50.764
just reductionist, but this, in any case,

917
00:63:50.773 --> 00:63:53.478
it is a good indicator. Now, um the

918
00:63:53.489 --> 00:63:57.938
other points you mentioned, of course, they are

919
00:63:57.949 --> 00:64:01.769
very uh important. Like looking at systemic discrimination.

920
00:64:01.898 --> 00:64:06.769
We know that um stress due to hierarchy in other

921
00:64:06.780 --> 00:64:12.418
animals um can be measured by means of cortisol levels

922
00:64:12.494 --> 00:64:15.753
. For example, discrimination due to gender race or

923
00:64:15.764 --> 00:64:19.675
other social categories probably will give the same result.

924
00:64:19.684 --> 00:64:23.094
I haven't looked into that. But I think here

925
00:64:23.103 --> 00:64:27.215
at the beginning of some big societal questions and um

926
00:64:27.224 --> 00:64:30.204
this, I think the scientific journey will eventually take

927
00:64:30.215 --> 00:64:32.938
us exactly in this direction. Mhm No, a

928
00:64:32.949 --> 00:64:38.739
actually that, that bit about hierarchy and cortisol levels

929
00:64:38.750 --> 00:64:42.168
. It reminded me of studies that Dr Robert Sapolsky

930
00:64:42.179 --> 00:64:45.889
did with baboons in baboon societies where apparently the low

931
00:64:45.898 --> 00:64:51.378
, the lower ranking baboons had higher levels of cortisol

932
00:64:51.389 --> 00:64:56.829
, higher levels of stress and that affected the physiology

933
00:64:56.840 --> 00:64:59.059
in many different ways. And then it talks about

934
00:64:59.070 --> 00:65:00.978
an episode where I don't know exactly why, but

935
00:65:00.989 --> 00:65:05.039
for some reason, the higher ranking baboons were wiped

936
00:65:05.050 --> 00:65:10.590
out and then suddenly the cortisol levels for the others

937
00:65:10.599 --> 00:65:14.070
went down and the society was more peaceful, at

938
00:65:14.079 --> 00:65:15.449
least for a while. So uh yeah, I

939
00:65:15.458 --> 00:65:18.369
guess that's uh an example of that. And if

940
00:65:18.378 --> 00:65:23.168
you think of what uh cortisol does not only to

941
00:65:23.179 --> 00:65:25.500
your organs, so to somatic organs, but also

942
00:65:25.510 --> 00:65:28.938
to your brain that it interferes. I already said

943
00:65:28.949 --> 00:65:31.929
that right, uh it interferes with neuroplasticity. It

944
00:65:31.938 --> 00:65:36.090
uh seemingly has an effect on um the size of

945
00:65:36.099 --> 00:65:42.648
the hippocampus. Um Regina Sullivan's lab showed that stress

946
00:65:42.659 --> 00:65:45.728
components when elevated, had an effect on the maturation

947
00:65:45.739 --> 00:65:47.273
of the Amygdala, so of the Fear Center.

948
00:65:47.284 --> 00:65:49.753
So this is a bit of a uh pop science

949
00:65:49.764 --> 00:65:53.894
term. But you know, um the the the

950
00:65:53.905 --> 00:65:56.514
the the the uh that the the activation of the

951
00:65:56.523 --> 00:66:00.523
Amygdala sets in earlier, which has an effect on

952
00:66:00.965 --> 00:66:03.094
what type of learning happens. So a shift from

953
00:66:03.103 --> 00:66:08.503
preferential to aversion learning. So this has immense consequences

954
00:66:08.514 --> 00:66:12.885
just by looking at a factor like socio-economic sta status

955
00:66:14.659 --> 00:66:18.820
. So going back to what normal means and the

956
00:66:18.829 --> 00:66:24.139
implications it has for how we think about traits,

957
00:66:24.148 --> 00:66:29.050
um disorders and so on. How should we think

958
00:66:29.059 --> 00:66:31.289
about normal then? I mean, because I guess

959
00:66:31.300 --> 00:66:35.409
that if we are being realistic here, I mean

960
00:66:35.750 --> 00:66:40.958
, there will always be norms in human societies,

961
00:66:40.969 --> 00:66:42.989
right? And there are things that we will always

962
00:66:43.000 --> 00:66:48.599
consider normal or abnormal. But from a scientific perspective

963
00:66:48.938 --> 00:66:53.570
, do you think that we should still think about

964
00:66:53.949 --> 00:66:59.849
normal in any meaningful way or not? Yeah,

965
00:66:59.860 --> 00:67:03.800
that's a difficult question. So um uh maybe let

966
00:67:03.809 --> 00:67:06.438
me answer this from a more practical point of view

967
00:67:08.019 --> 00:67:11.800
. So um there is this, this, this

968
00:67:11.809 --> 00:67:17.039
idea of uh normalcy is kind of dictated or established

969
00:67:17.050 --> 00:67:21.829
by the reference group that give, that is like

970
00:67:21.840 --> 00:67:26.949
the bigger part of the the society does not even

971
00:67:26.958 --> 00:67:29.889
have to be. But uh say, say this

972
00:67:29.898 --> 00:67:31.599
, if, if we, if we follow a

973
00:67:31.610 --> 00:67:36.458
bio static biostatistical approach in the sense of Christopher Bush

974
00:67:36.590 --> 00:67:41.070
, so we have this uh this reference group and

975
00:67:41.079 --> 00:67:44.458
this reference group kind of defines normals. It is

976
00:67:44.478 --> 00:67:46.760
the current situation. Now, what also happens if

977
00:67:46.780 --> 00:67:50.128
we, if we connect it back to what uh

978
00:67:50.139 --> 00:67:55.250
we've discussed earlier about niche construction, it will also

979
00:67:55.260 --> 00:67:58.590
be this kind of dominant group in within the population

980
00:67:58.599 --> 00:68:01.188
that shaped the niche. This is the group that

981
00:68:01.199 --> 00:68:05.260
determine um what sort of environment we will all be

982
00:68:05.269 --> 00:68:09.360
living in. Now, uh in some cases,

983
00:68:09.369 --> 00:68:13.449
it has been shown that when there is a variation

984
00:68:13.458 --> 00:68:16.689
in traits, like maybe in high functional autistic people

985
00:68:16.699 --> 00:68:20.060
, like in uh uh uh in, in uh

986
00:68:20.069 --> 00:68:28.239
high functional uh asper people that they have immensely contributed

987
00:68:28.250 --> 00:68:32.259
to society, to success of say um the virtual

988
00:68:32.270 --> 00:68:36.757
environment and so on. Um This is because they

989
00:68:36.769 --> 00:68:41.858
could pick their niche that seemingly fitted them and what

990
00:68:41.868 --> 00:68:45.469
they seemingly work well adapted to. Ideally, it

991
00:68:45.479 --> 00:68:50.899
would be these people who are neurodivergent, so not

992
00:68:50.909 --> 00:68:56.600
neurotypical, but you know, uh uh that,

993
00:68:56.668 --> 00:69:00.668
that could contribute in saying or in shaping the niche

994
00:69:00.680 --> 00:69:03.560
because they are, they would be better adapted then

995
00:69:03.569 --> 00:69:05.359
and it would be, yeah, it would be

996
00:69:05.369 --> 00:69:11.489
much better uh for them to um to function and

997
00:69:11.500 --> 00:69:14.708
to contribute to society. Uh I know this is

998
00:69:14.720 --> 00:69:17.509
a huge challenge and in some cases with severe psychopathologies

999
00:69:17.520 --> 00:69:20.579
, it might never work. Um But yeah,

1000
00:69:20.588 --> 00:69:23.869
so, so this is, this is one of

1001
00:69:23.878 --> 00:69:27.168
the answers in I I in practical terms. Uh

1002
00:69:27.180 --> 00:69:29.909
the other answer and coming a little bit more from

1003
00:69:29.918 --> 00:69:35.908
the conceptual side now is um so defining uh um

1004
00:69:36.349 --> 00:69:42.179
what's normal um has got, I already said that

1005
00:69:42.188 --> 00:69:45.757
it's normative as well as this naturalistic uh component.

1006
00:69:46.028 --> 00:69:51.878
Now, um if we want to uh combine these

1007
00:69:51.890 --> 00:69:58.970
two, then this means that um we will have

1008
00:69:58.979 --> 00:70:03.609
to uh have a real um different way of looking

1009
00:70:03.619 --> 00:70:06.899
um at, at, at uh at variability,

1010
00:70:06.909 --> 00:70:12.798
at genetic variability at um behavioral variability. And I'm

1011
00:70:12.810 --> 00:70:15.569
not sure where our society stands there at the moment

1012
00:70:15.600 --> 00:70:17.899
. I, I it's actually very interesting that you

1013
00:70:17.909 --> 00:70:23.958
mentioned neurodivergent people, for example, people on the

1014
00:70:23.970 --> 00:70:27.000
autism spectrum because I, I was actually going to

1015
00:70:27.009 --> 00:70:30.310
ask you uh what, what were your thoughts on

1016
00:70:30.319 --> 00:70:33.060
the neurodiversity movement? So I if I understand it

1017
00:70:33.069 --> 00:70:38.500
correctly, you look at it uh mostly positively,

1018
00:70:38.918 --> 00:70:41.579
right? Um Yes, I do, I do

1019
00:70:41.708 --> 00:70:45.418
. Um in general. Um I do because I

1020
00:70:45.430 --> 00:70:51.470
think um it is important that um we provide people

1021
00:70:51.479 --> 00:70:55.239
with uh a niche where they can flourish, where

1022
00:70:55.250 --> 00:70:58.029
they, they're nurtured, where they can develop their

1023
00:70:58.039 --> 00:71:00.699
potential at the same time. And here, iii

1024
00:71:00.708 --> 00:71:03.239
I maybe I've heard a little bit of a criticism

1025
00:71:03.250 --> 00:71:06.659
from, from you. Uh And here uh but

1026
00:71:06.668 --> 00:71:09.350
I, if I heard the criticism, I do

1027
00:71:09.359 --> 00:71:13.399
also agree, we have to be also careful that

1028
00:71:13.489 --> 00:71:18.609
um that we do not kind of um we,

1029
00:71:18.619 --> 00:71:23.009
we that we, we will have to accept that

1030
00:71:23.020 --> 00:71:27.109
uh some symptoms are quite debilitating so they are very

1031
00:71:27.119 --> 00:71:30.310
severe and just act actually. Uh I mean,

1032
00:71:30.319 --> 00:71:32.890
if there was some sort of criticism in the way

1033
00:71:32.899 --> 00:71:36.088
I expressed my question, it was exactly about that

1034
00:71:36.100 --> 00:71:42.789
point because there are, I think good small criticisms

1035
00:71:42.798 --> 00:71:45.479
of the neurodiversity movement that perhaps it, they apply

1036
00:71:45.489 --> 00:71:49.168
mostly to just a few people and not most people

1037
00:71:49.180 --> 00:71:54.930
of the movement where there's a risk of trivializing people

1038
00:71:54.939 --> 00:72:00.109
that really suffer severely from certain, for example,

1039
00:72:00.119 --> 00:72:03.458
extreme forms of autism and other conditions like that.

1040
00:72:03.699 --> 00:72:06.088
Right. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I

1041
00:72:06.100 --> 00:72:09.359
agree. Um, yeah. So this is what

1042
00:72:09.369 --> 00:72:13.029
we would have to be careful as a society not

1043
00:72:13.039 --> 00:72:15.039
to, exactly, not to trivialize it. Um

1044
00:72:15.048 --> 00:72:17.088
, yeah. But, uh, in, in

1045
00:72:17.100 --> 00:72:19.350
general I think we, as a society we have

1046
00:72:19.359 --> 00:72:23.250
to be much more open to, uh, to

1047
00:72:23.259 --> 00:72:28.850
variability because this actually might open up completely new niches

1048
00:72:28.859 --> 00:72:30.529
which we were not even aware of. So,

1049
00:72:30.539 --> 00:72:34.970
again, it's about potential. Mhm. Right.

1050
00:72:35.180 --> 00:72:40.759
So I would like to get now into a trauma

1051
00:72:41.048 --> 00:72:43.609
and stress, but we've already talked a little bit

1052
00:72:43.619 --> 00:72:47.930
about stress, mostly traumatic experiences then. But before

1053
00:72:47.939 --> 00:72:53.310
we get into what actually counts as a traumatic experience

1054
00:72:53.319 --> 00:72:56.810
, I mean, are there some aspects of how

1055
00:72:56.819 --> 00:73:00.369
our memory and emotions work that you think would be

1056
00:73:00.579 --> 00:73:05.458
most relevant for people to understand that would apply to

1057
00:73:05.739 --> 00:73:12.759
uh traumatic ex or to how we understand traumatic experiences

1058
00:73:13.409 --> 00:73:18.250
? Mhm. So, um uh can I just

1059
00:73:18.259 --> 00:73:21.930
rephrase it? So, um you want or the

1060
00:73:21.939 --> 00:73:26.930
question is how emotions connect to memory? Is,

1061
00:73:26.939 --> 00:73:29.009
is this or, or, or is it,

1062
00:73:29.199 --> 00:73:30.810
um, yeah, because I, I mean,

1063
00:73:30.819 --> 00:73:34.079
I guess that, uh perhaps uh when we're talking

1064
00:73:34.088 --> 00:73:39.119
about dramatic experiences and trying to understand how they work

1065
00:73:39.128 --> 00:73:43.180
and so on, uh two very important aspects of

1066
00:73:43.189 --> 00:73:47.680
our psychology that play role here are memory and emotion

1067
00:73:47.729 --> 00:73:49.619
, right? And uh and basically what I was

1068
00:73:49.628 --> 00:73:51.750
asking you o of course, this is a,

1069
00:73:51.899 --> 00:73:56.689
I guess a very broad question, but what would

1070
00:73:56.699 --> 00:73:59.770
you think are perhaps some of the aspects of how

1071
00:73:59.779 --> 00:74:04.338
our memory works and our, and our emotion connects

1072
00:74:04.350 --> 00:74:09.609
to memory that then allow for us to have an

1073
00:74:09.619 --> 00:74:13.989
understanding of what a traumatic experience is. That,

1074
00:74:14.000 --> 00:74:15.829
that's my question. Yeah, I understand. OK

1075
00:74:15.859 --> 00:74:19.759
. So um so there is of course, a

1076
00:74:19.770 --> 00:74:27.149
plethora of um evidence that emotions are strongly influence memory

1077
00:74:27.159 --> 00:74:30.338
, especially episodic memory. Why is that? Because

1078
00:74:30.350 --> 00:74:34.020
that's uh uh has a lot to do with emotions

1079
00:74:34.029 --> 00:74:38.958
and how they um change our perception per se.

1080
00:74:39.149 --> 00:74:45.024
Because we um emotions increase our uh awareness that um

1081
00:74:45.085 --> 00:74:48.875
our attention to focus on specific details, um think

1082
00:74:48.886 --> 00:74:53.505
of accidents or something where all of a sudden our

1083
00:74:53.545 --> 00:74:57.795
um uh censor threshold gets lowered and we remember very

1084
00:74:57.805 --> 00:75:00.636
, very minute details about, you know, crashing

1085
00:75:00.645 --> 00:75:05.391
glass or about um it looks like it feels like

1086
00:75:05.400 --> 00:75:10.131
the accident took much longer, uh like a minute

1087
00:75:10.141 --> 00:75:12.872
and it, in reality was only less than a

1088
00:75:12.881 --> 00:75:15.551
second probably. Uh And this is because our sensory

1089
00:75:15.561 --> 00:75:18.332
threshold has, has been decreased and we are perceiving

1090
00:75:19.110 --> 00:75:24.791
, perceiving many more details, smells, sounds um

1091
00:75:24.801 --> 00:75:28.351
tactile information. So this is this is this is

1092
00:75:28.360 --> 00:75:32.739
well known. Um now, um this is evolutionarily

1093
00:75:32.750 --> 00:75:38.930
important because emotions are kind of a label that inform

1094
00:75:38.939 --> 00:75:42.729
us or that kind of strength and synaptic connections.

1095
00:75:42.859 --> 00:75:45.298
Um to tell us this is an important memory,

1096
00:75:45.310 --> 00:75:49.750
you should not forget that. Um and uh it

1097
00:75:49.759 --> 00:75:55.239
also emotions also help us that they guide us through

1098
00:75:55.250 --> 00:76:00.878
the environment and um give or facilitate the detection,

1099
00:76:00.899 --> 00:76:05.100
quick detection of something that's relevant for our um FFFF

1100
00:76:05.109 --> 00:76:09.640
for us. Like um yeah, any, any

1101
00:76:09.649 --> 00:76:14.020
sort of uh stimuli like maybe a friend or foe

1102
00:76:14.029 --> 00:76:16.458
or food or, or whatever might be relevant now

1103
00:76:16.869 --> 00:76:24.649
um related to um why is it that uh in

1104
00:76:24.659 --> 00:76:30.770
traumatic experiences we remember um things. So Ooo what

1105
00:76:30.779 --> 00:76:33.699
, what happens in traumatic experiences uh on the emotional

1106
00:76:33.708 --> 00:76:38.079
level? Um So there, there is a,

1107
00:76:38.088 --> 00:76:41.529
there is a few things to unpack here um on

1108
00:76:41.539 --> 00:76:51.770
, on one hand. So um see um one

1109
00:76:51.779 --> 00:76:57.838
thing I've already said is that uh it um lowers

1110
00:76:57.850 --> 00:77:03.199
the threshold for sensory perception. Um And uh stress

1111
00:77:03.208 --> 00:77:10.000
itself uh has a um uh uh i it,

1112
00:77:10.009 --> 00:77:15.418
it stress helps us to uh process this stimuli um

1113
00:77:15.430 --> 00:77:24.220
very fast. Um because it um um it takes

1114
00:77:24.229 --> 00:77:29.000
the um unconscious route via Amygdala, via uh the

1115
00:77:29.009 --> 00:77:30.680
hypothalamus and the uh uh uh and, and the

1116
00:77:30.689 --> 00:77:35.199
Amygdala. And um it does not need to um

1117
00:77:35.208 --> 00:77:41.079
go into um into the cognitive uh more aware route

1118
00:77:41.088 --> 00:77:45.750
or the conscious route. Um And um gives us

1119
00:77:45.759 --> 00:77:48.770
a very quick perception of something that um that might

1120
00:77:48.779 --> 00:77:54.310
be a threat to us. Um And this unconscious

1121
00:77:54.319 --> 00:77:59.168
uh change in our physiology can persist if the stress

1122
00:77:59.180 --> 00:78:01.048
level like an acute stress level, like in the

1123
00:78:01.060 --> 00:78:06.409
case of um uh developmental trauma, complex trauma,

1124
00:78:06.418 --> 00:78:10.418
you know, if there is a prolonged um uh

1125
00:78:10.430 --> 00:78:15.259
stress level, then um this prolonged stress level,

1126
00:78:15.270 --> 00:78:19.739
this um this this prolonged stress level will have um

1127
00:78:19.750 --> 00:78:25.699
a an effect on uh how we detect um stimuli

1128
00:78:25.923 --> 00:78:27.314
in the future. So in my book, I

1129
00:78:27.324 --> 00:78:30.713
write at some point uh as it changes the stress

1130
00:78:30.725 --> 00:78:32.173
axis and it actually change, it changes the whole

1131
00:78:32.194 --> 00:78:36.024
physiology. That means uh Children who have been exposed

1132
00:78:36.034 --> 00:78:40.034
to this type of trauma very often live in a

1133
00:78:40.043 --> 00:78:44.509
relabeled world. Um That means they are in a

1134
00:78:44.520 --> 00:78:49.329
constant state of alert where the um where the the

1135
00:78:49.470 --> 00:78:54.739
uh synthetic uh nervous system. So the autonomic nervous

1136
00:78:54.750 --> 00:78:59.189
system is always in a flight to fight response.

1137
00:78:59.479 --> 00:79:01.104
So, um yeah, that, that, that's

1138
00:79:01.114 --> 00:79:05.185
uh something. The other thing um that that also

1139
00:79:05.194 --> 00:79:11.364
is very typical for um survivors of trauma is that

1140
00:79:11.375 --> 00:79:16.494
they have very often intrusive uh hyperemic uh memories.

1141
00:79:16.503 --> 00:79:21.399
So, memories that feel as if they are experienced

1142
00:79:21.409 --> 00:79:26.600
now in the present with very strong details. And

1143
00:79:26.609 --> 00:79:30.279
that is again related to what I said earlier about

1144
00:79:30.289 --> 00:79:34.759
this uh uh lowering of the sensory threshold and remembering

1145
00:79:34.770 --> 00:79:38.418
many, many of the details. Yeah. And

1146
00:79:38.430 --> 00:79:41.588
then there is some of the opposite uh things which

1147
00:79:41.600 --> 00:79:45.449
I ha I haven't mentioned uh now and but just

1148
00:79:45.458 --> 00:79:47.189
let me say a few words about that is that

1149
00:79:47.378 --> 00:79:51.289
in some cases when there is stress level is extremely

1150
00:79:51.298 --> 00:79:57.310
high, um people completely forget the because they cannot

1151
00:79:57.979 --> 00:80:03.359
integrate um or the the the memory cannot um be

1152
00:80:03.369 --> 00:80:05.338
integrated in, in, in the net in the

1153
00:80:05.350 --> 00:80:09.918
existing network of, of memories. So they,

1154
00:80:09.930 --> 00:80:12.918
it, it's almost as if they forget. But

1155
00:80:12.930 --> 00:80:15.350
um this is um yeah, this this happens especially

1156
00:80:15.458 --> 00:80:19.759
with very young Children uh before the explicit memory is

1157
00:80:19.770 --> 00:80:26.600
fully formed. Uh A and this also applies to

1158
00:80:26.739 --> 00:80:31.949
, for example, contexts of unpredictability and help helplessness

1159
00:80:31.958 --> 00:80:36.640
like like for example, low social status, poverty

1160
00:80:36.689 --> 00:80:41.798
, lack of social support and contexts like that.

1161
00:80:42.149 --> 00:80:47.239
Exactly. Because um especially that the last thing I

1162
00:80:47.250 --> 00:80:51.458
said about if it's uh I if it doesn't,

1163
00:80:51.470 --> 00:80:56.759
if you don't even have an active explicit memory about

1164
00:80:56.770 --> 00:81:00.418
the incident, but you're still suffering from uh a

1165
00:81:00.430 --> 00:81:04.239
change in your um in, in, in your

1166
00:81:04.250 --> 00:81:08.109
stress axis or in the components of your stress axis

1167
00:81:08.338 --> 00:81:13.930
. Then um this uh gives you a different way

1168
00:81:13.939 --> 00:81:15.609
of reacting to stimuli for a long time. It

1169
00:81:15.619 --> 00:81:19.890
has been believed that uh we must find high cortisol

1170
00:81:19.930 --> 00:81:25.970
levels. But um paradoxically, um more recently,

1171
00:81:25.979 --> 00:81:30.789
it has been shown that people suffering from severe long

1172
00:81:30.798 --> 00:81:34.939
term stress, they adapt their organism to this extremely

1173
00:81:34.949 --> 00:81:40.009
high stress level uh by changing the stress axis and

1174
00:81:40.020 --> 00:81:45.548
they actually have relatively low um uh um cortisol.

1175
00:81:45.409 --> 00:81:49.680
Uh But this happens on the expense of um and

1176
00:81:49.689 --> 00:81:53.958
like an allo static load, that means whenever they

1177
00:81:53.970 --> 00:81:58.208
experience something that is a little bit for us would

1178
00:81:58.220 --> 00:81:59.949
be a neutral stimulus. But for them, it

1179
00:81:59.958 --> 00:82:02.338
is a little bit um exciting or something, then

1180
00:82:02.350 --> 00:82:09.548
their stress uh uh um reaction, stress response completely

1181
00:82:09.560 --> 00:82:14.958
uh a exceeds a normal response. So this is

1182
00:82:14.970 --> 00:82:16.680
um yeah. So these, the, these people

1183
00:82:16.689 --> 00:82:21.850
who are um uh trauma survivors, especially for long

1184
00:82:21.859 --> 00:82:27.220
term, they have really significant change in the neurophysiology

1185
00:82:27.829 --> 00:82:30.088
. Mhm A a and so related to that,

1186
00:82:30.100 --> 00:82:38.168
there's this common idea that adversities make Children grow stronger

1187
00:82:38.418 --> 00:82:40.539
. But is that really the case? I mean

1188
00:82:40.548 --> 00:82:44.369
, is there good enough evidence to support that idea

1189
00:82:44.878 --> 00:82:47.548
? Mhm But this is, this is a really

1190
00:82:47.560 --> 00:82:53.850
important thing because uh you can uh then use that

1191
00:82:53.859 --> 00:82:58.319
um to draw policies and this is kind of the

1192
00:82:58.329 --> 00:83:01.369
standard view that you very often read in management books

1193
00:83:01.378 --> 00:83:04.529
and so on. Um But these management books are

1194
00:83:04.539 --> 00:83:09.399
addressed to, you know, people that um live

1195
00:83:09.409 --> 00:83:14.720
in relatively stable environments that are don't come from traumatic

1196
00:83:14.729 --> 00:83:16.520
experiences. So, on one hand, um I

1197
00:83:16.529 --> 00:83:19.069
want to cite again, you have already mentioned him

1198
00:83:19.079 --> 00:83:21.770
today. Uh Robert Sapolsky. On the other hand

1199
00:83:21.779 --> 00:83:24.798
, I want to say a few things about my

1200
00:83:24.810 --> 00:83:29.109
own work working with um with psychotherapists. So Robert

1201
00:83:29.479 --> 00:83:36.239
Sapolsky, he already um pointed out that um if

1202
00:83:38.829 --> 00:83:43.619
so, it's um he already pointed out that um

1203
00:83:44.409 --> 00:83:47.890
if uh you have uh a high level of stress

1204
00:83:48.020 --> 00:83:54.649
then being pushed towards more uncertainty, you know,

1205
00:83:54.819 --> 00:83:58.500
and this kind of learning zone and go out and

1206
00:83:58.509 --> 00:84:01.529
try to new things. Yeah, this actually um

1207
00:84:03.659 --> 00:84:08.390
triggers a whole different stress response than it would be

1208
00:84:08.399 --> 00:84:11.319
in other, would trigger in other people. And

1209
00:84:11.329 --> 00:84:14.918
from my own experience, I have seen that in

1210
00:84:14.930 --> 00:84:20.458
um when working with psychotherapists that um even very neutral

1211
00:84:20.470 --> 00:84:26.699
stimuli trigger a whole plethora of reactions that you could

1212
00:84:26.708 --> 00:84:29.680
not imagine that you would not see in a setting

1213
00:84:29.689 --> 00:84:32.229
with uh other kids, for example. And that

1214
00:84:32.239 --> 00:84:39.430
really um makes me um rethink that this has to

1215
00:84:39.439 --> 00:84:45.649
be um communicated more widely to policymakers to people who

1216
00:84:45.659 --> 00:84:48.029
are working with kids. So yy, you,

1217
00:84:48.039 --> 00:84:51.048
you don't push them out to learn something new to

1218
00:84:51.060 --> 00:84:55.600
get out of the comfort zone to um this has

1219
00:84:55.609 --> 00:84:57.770
to be, has to be done very, very

1220
00:84:57.779 --> 00:85:01.949
carefully. Um because we're just dealing with highly vulnerable

1221
00:85:01.958 --> 00:85:06.189
kids or, or grownups. Yeah. So this

1222
00:85:06.199 --> 00:85:10.369
stays long into adulthood, maybe your whole life.

1223
00:85:11.930 --> 00:85:15.369
Yeah. And later we're going to get into resilience

1224
00:85:15.378 --> 00:85:19.369
and how people develop it and what it means exactly

1225
00:85:19.378 --> 00:85:21.838
. But just before that, I would like to

1226
00:85:21.850 --> 00:85:26.668
ask you a little bit about attachment theory because it

1227
00:85:26.680 --> 00:85:31.079
seems that the people we develop relationships with in early

1228
00:85:31.088 --> 00:85:35.359
life and uh whoever they might be and we're going

1229
00:85:35.369 --> 00:85:40.338
to talk about that those relationships seems to uh seem

1230
00:85:40.350 --> 00:85:43.149
to be very important. And then I also want

1231
00:85:43.159 --> 00:85:45.569
to ask you, of course, if attachment,

1232
00:85:45.579 --> 00:85:48.939
the, the attachment style one develops in childhood and

1233
00:85:48.949 --> 00:85:53.399
so on is fixed or not, we're going to

1234
00:85:53.409 --> 00:85:55.739
get into that. But I mean, what role

1235
00:85:55.750 --> 00:86:00.958
do you think that attachment theory plays in this context

1236
00:86:00.970 --> 00:86:02.039
? Of trying to uh I mean, in the

1237
00:86:02.048 --> 00:86:09.798
broader context of developmental psychology. But first of all

1238
00:86:09.810 --> 00:86:13.180
, I think as humans, we are uh a

1239
00:86:13.189 --> 00:86:17.619
hyper selfie species. So attachment is not only something

1240
00:86:17.628 --> 00:86:24.890
that is um evolutionary um put down in our uh

1241
00:86:24.899 --> 00:86:30.180
biology. So we're actively uh we need because we're

1242
00:86:30.189 --> 00:86:34.159
uh the species that is born relatively early um in

1243
00:86:34.168 --> 00:86:39.500
as compared to other primates with a relatively uh very

1244
00:86:39.619 --> 00:86:42.970
uh immature brain where there is a lot uh uh

1245
00:86:42.989 --> 00:86:45.720
still to develop, that means we're helpless. We

1246
00:86:45.729 --> 00:86:51.182
need the um support of caregivers. And of course

1247
00:86:51.192 --> 00:86:57.783
, um attachment theory, this is uh this goes

1248
00:86:57.792 --> 00:87:00.652
back to John Bowie and Marie AINS was in the

1249
00:87:00.662 --> 00:87:02.902
, in the 19 fifties. So, um there

1250
00:87:02.912 --> 00:87:05.362
has been a lot of amendments made to, to

1251
00:87:05.372 --> 00:87:11.002
this theory but the key principles or the key messages

1252
00:87:11.012 --> 00:87:14.942
uh still remain true. So, um we need

1253
00:87:14.953 --> 00:87:17.734
um care give us otherwise we could not, uh

1254
00:87:17.904 --> 00:87:21.904
we could not develop if we are severely neglected.

1255
00:87:21.916 --> 00:87:27.444
If we um if there is nobody looking after us

1256
00:87:27.456 --> 00:87:30.365
after us as a child, this um triggers an

1257
00:87:30.375 --> 00:87:35.095
immense stress in us. Children cannot regulate stress by

1258
00:87:35.104 --> 00:87:39.354
themselves. They can uh upregulate the cortisol levels,

1259
00:87:39.365 --> 00:87:42.835
but what they cannot regulate, they cannot down regulate

1260
00:87:42.845 --> 00:87:45.668
yet by themselves. So they need to be down

1261
00:87:45.739 --> 00:87:48.659
regulated. Stress needs to be down regulated from the

1262
00:87:48.668 --> 00:87:53.088
um um caregiver externally. So, you know,

1263
00:87:53.338 --> 00:87:57.079
uh body contact Oxytocin. Oxytocin is a wonderful uh

1264
00:87:57.088 --> 00:88:00.789
antagonist to, to, to uh co so,

1265
00:88:00.810 --> 00:88:04.640
so this is what all this attachment is is for

1266
00:88:04.649 --> 00:88:10.000
because um we need in order to survive um a

1267
00:88:10.009 --> 00:88:14.640
newborn and AAA an infant needs a connection to,

1268
00:88:14.649 --> 00:88:18.159
to a caregiver. Um Now, this is something

1269
00:88:18.168 --> 00:88:23.279
that was very controversial about uh yeah, 70 years

1270
00:88:23.289 --> 00:88:28.350
ago, maybe even 6050 years ago. Um I

1271
00:88:28.359 --> 00:88:30.418
think everybody accepts that now. So this is not

1272
00:88:30.430 --> 00:88:33.500
, this is no longer controversial. However, what

1273
00:88:33.509 --> 00:88:41.628
you already mentioned is that this is a developmental process

1274
00:88:41.659 --> 00:88:44.890
. And the question is, is this fixed or

1275
00:88:44.899 --> 00:88:48.250
what, what happens in adulthood? And basically,

1276
00:88:48.259 --> 00:88:50.890
this is not so easy to answer. First of

1277
00:88:50.899 --> 00:88:55.029
all, um it is, it is a developmental

1278
00:88:55.039 --> 00:88:59.470
process and it also is um split in different phases

1279
00:88:59.479 --> 00:89:00.409
. So we have like an early pro phase,

1280
00:89:00.430 --> 00:89:03.708
we have a um then the this preference learning phase

1281
00:89:03.720 --> 00:89:09.509
, then we have this aversion uh learn phase um

1282
00:89:09.859 --> 00:89:14.500
that goes along with neuro anatomical changes. So,

1283
00:89:14.509 --> 00:89:17.329
aversion learning for example, sets in when the maturation

1284
00:89:17.338 --> 00:89:19.899
of the Amygdala happens. So about the age of

1285
00:89:19.909 --> 00:89:24.708
7 to 8 months in humans uh in other in

1286
00:89:24.720 --> 00:89:28.958
chimpanzees about four months and so on. So um

1287
00:89:29.208 --> 00:89:30.949
you can see, but then there is a partner

1288
00:89:30.958 --> 00:89:34.128
correcting phase at the age of, you know,

1289
00:89:34.149 --> 00:89:38.100
three years or something. When people, when Children

1290
00:89:38.109 --> 00:89:41.569
start to begin to develop the theory of mind.

1291
00:89:42.100 --> 00:89:45.378
And then what you said is, yeah, we

1292
00:89:45.390 --> 00:89:48.060
have an attachment style. This is something how we

1293
00:89:48.069 --> 00:89:50.199
, we observe that we, we experience it.

1294
00:89:50.208 --> 00:89:54.609
This is how we expect that people act in a

1295
00:89:54.619 --> 00:89:59.970
partnership with us. However, uh if you have

1296
00:89:59.979 --> 00:90:05.109
a um a lot of positive experience with secondary caregiver

1297
00:90:05.119 --> 00:90:09.930
, secondary attachment persons and that can even be your

1298
00:90:09.939 --> 00:90:12.750
teacher or your, I don't know, coach,

1299
00:90:12.759 --> 00:90:16.378
uh sports coach or whatever. Um even then there

1300
00:90:16.390 --> 00:90:20.509
is good potential that you, at least with some

1301
00:90:20.520 --> 00:90:24.060
attachment stars, maybe not with the disorganized, but

1302
00:90:24.069 --> 00:90:28.289
with uh the other uh uh two attachment stars um

1303
00:90:28.619 --> 00:90:31.109
that you can balance out and you can improve and

1304
00:90:31.119 --> 00:90:34.418
get a secure attachment in a partnership play later on

1305
00:90:34.430 --> 00:90:39.600
in life. Mhm. Oh, ok. So

1306
00:90:39.609 --> 00:90:42.079
I, I have two kinds of questions here.

1307
00:90:42.088 --> 00:90:45.579
Uh First of all, um when it comes to

1308
00:90:45.588 --> 00:90:50.458
the primary caregiver or caregivers, does it really matter

1309
00:90:50.470 --> 00:90:54.128
who they are? I mean, does it necessarily

1310
00:90:54.140 --> 00:90:58.458
need to be the mother or the father or even

1311
00:90:58.470 --> 00:91:02.989
someone from the brother family or can it be really

1312
00:91:03.000 --> 00:91:06.970
anyone as long as we develop uh ki uh a

1313
00:91:06.989 --> 00:91:12.829
secure kind of attachment to them? Yeah. Um

1314
00:91:12.838 --> 00:91:16.829
Yeah, you, you actually um really pinpointed towards

1315
00:91:16.838 --> 00:91:18.949
one of the weaknesses of the original, of the

1316
00:91:18.958 --> 00:91:24.909
traditional um attachment theory as formulated by Bowie because he

1317
00:91:24.918 --> 00:91:28.750
basically just looked at the diad bond between mother and

1318
00:91:28.759 --> 00:91:30.859
child. Yeah. And I, and I mean

1319
00:91:30.869 --> 00:91:32.979
, to be fair back then, uh perhaps we

1320
00:91:32.989 --> 00:91:36.680
didn't have enough anthropology to know that we are co-operative

1321
00:91:36.689 --> 00:91:41.579
breeders and he was starting from a point of uh

1322
00:91:41.588 --> 00:91:44.918
evolutionary theory, right? He was very influenced by

1323
00:91:44.930 --> 00:91:47.869
evolutionary theory. And back then, we fought mostly

1324
00:91:47.878 --> 00:91:55.039
about uh females as the primary and perhaps only caregivers

1325
00:91:55.048 --> 00:91:57.329
, right? So just to be fair. Yeah

1326
00:91:57.338 --> 00:91:59.970
, you're right. However, and here I have

1327
00:91:59.979 --> 00:92:01.939
to contradict a little bit from his own biography.

1328
00:92:03.329 --> 00:92:08.009
Uh John Bobby should have known that it's not necessarily

1329
00:92:08.020 --> 00:92:10.878
the mother because his attachment figure. And that was

1330
00:92:10.890 --> 00:92:13.859
actually the reason why he started to um venture into

1331
00:92:13.869 --> 00:92:17.048
this field. His primary um attachment figure was actually

1332
00:92:17.060 --> 00:92:21.699
his uh child carer called I think Minnie. So

1333
00:92:21.708 --> 00:92:26.119
the first four years of his life, um you

1334
00:92:26.128 --> 00:92:27.989
know, he was in coming from a rich family

1335
00:92:28.000 --> 00:92:29.869
. So it was not the mother actually being the

1336
00:92:29.878 --> 00:92:32.939
caregiver looking after him, it was actually an ow

1337
00:92:32.979 --> 00:92:36.128
parent, somebody else who took this role. Now

1338
00:92:36.140 --> 00:92:40.569
, what you said is absolutely correct. So um

1339
00:92:41.029 --> 00:92:43.949
does it need to be the mother at that point

1340
00:92:43.958 --> 00:92:48.208
we did not have um or the the there was

1341
00:92:48.220 --> 00:92:55.489
not enough knowledge from anthropology studies. Um even he

1342
00:92:55.500 --> 00:92:58.279
kind of uh bo we also excluded fathers. But

1343
00:92:58.289 --> 00:93:02.159
now we know that that uh father can be as

1344
00:93:02.168 --> 00:93:04.869
good as an attachment figure as the as mother,

1345
00:93:04.878 --> 00:93:09.668
in terms of stress regulation, in terms of bonding

1346
00:93:09.854 --> 00:93:13.083
, you know, even uh oxytocin release is it

1347
00:93:13.095 --> 00:93:15.324
has been shown measured by, by fathers or not

1348
00:93:15.333 --> 00:93:17.975
just fathers, but by a male caregiver. Let

1349
00:93:17.984 --> 00:93:23.003
me just be neutral there now, um, as

1350
00:93:23.015 --> 00:93:27.189
you said already, um So what about now with

1351
00:93:27.329 --> 00:93:30.109
the new information we have from, um, from

1352
00:93:30.119 --> 00:93:36.180
anthropology studies? So, actually, interestingly there is

1353
00:93:36.189 --> 00:93:42.208
um some uh populations, these are, which is

1354
00:93:42.220 --> 00:93:45.449
still hunter gatherers. Um And there it has been

1355
00:93:45.458 --> 00:93:50.878
shown that the very young Children uh have many primary

1356
00:93:50.890 --> 00:93:54.689
caregivers up to, I don't know, 18 or

1357
00:93:54.699 --> 00:93:59.909
something. And, um, and these all can

1358
00:93:59.918 --> 00:94:05.109
function as, um, there um with them,

1359
00:94:05.119 --> 00:94:10.250
they also develop very strong attachment bonds. And interestingly

1360
00:94:10.259 --> 00:94:15.810
, these uh Children also show much lower um stranger

1361
00:94:15.819 --> 00:94:18.208
anxieties at this, you know, age of 7

1362
00:94:18.220 --> 00:94:20.659
to 8 months. So, yeah. So it

1363
00:94:20.668 --> 00:94:23.069
, no, it doesn't have to be the mother

1364
00:94:23.079 --> 00:94:26.029
. It has to be somebody who provides safety nurturing

1365
00:94:26.289 --> 00:94:30.770
um stress relief, uh regulation. Yeah. Mhm

1366
00:94:31.569 --> 00:94:33.789
OK. So the, the second kind of question

1367
00:94:33.798 --> 00:94:36.609
I had here was OK. So it's basically a

1368
00:94:36.619 --> 00:94:41.119
two part question. So the first part is ju

1369
00:94:41.128 --> 00:94:46.369
just to make this point clear uh attachment styles later

1370
00:94:46.378 --> 00:94:50.819
later on in life, apply to basically any kind

1371
00:94:50.829 --> 00:94:55.939
of social relationship, right to friendships, to romantic

1372
00:94:55.949 --> 00:95:00.069
relationships and so on or not. Basically, yes

1373
00:95:00.079 --> 00:95:05.509
. But the closer uh the friendship and usually partnership

1374
00:95:06.000 --> 00:95:10.189
, um the more relevant it is. So with

1375
00:95:10.199 --> 00:95:13.869
just normal distant friends or at work, you can

1376
00:95:13.878 --> 00:95:16.489
adjust very well. But the closer it gets emotionally

1377
00:95:16.500 --> 00:95:19.930
because this you have this so called inner working model

1378
00:95:20.668 --> 00:95:26.918
that kind of triggers your emotional model that that you've

1379
00:95:26.930 --> 00:95:30.079
learned in childhood. Yeah. A and when it

1380
00:95:30.088 --> 00:95:33.958
comes to that bit, we mentioned about attachment styles

1381
00:95:33.970 --> 00:95:39.850
potentially changing across the lifespan. I, I mean

1382
00:95:39.859 --> 00:95:41.500
, it just came to my mind, I don't

1383
00:95:41.509 --> 00:95:45.439
know if there's any specific research on this, but

1384
00:95:45.449 --> 00:95:47.378
it just came to my mind if we should also

1385
00:95:47.390 --> 00:95:51.319
perhaps think about attachment style as we did back when

1386
00:95:51.329 --> 00:95:57.569
we talked about dynamical systems theory and other psychological traits

1387
00:95:57.579 --> 00:96:00.399
. I mean, could it be the case that

1388
00:96:00.720 --> 00:96:02.759
I don't know in, in particular periods of our

1389
00:96:02.770 --> 00:96:06.020
life? Because we might experience, I don't know

1390
00:96:06.029 --> 00:96:11.890
particular kinds of friendships or romantic relationships. Even if

1391
00:96:11.899 --> 00:96:15.159
we, we grew up being securely attached, then

1392
00:96:15.168 --> 00:96:21.199
we might become circumstantially more anxiously attached, more violent

1393
00:96:21.208 --> 00:96:27.779
or the opposite. Yep. Um So, so

1394
00:96:27.789 --> 00:96:30.640
the, the opposite becoming more securely attached because of

1395
00:96:30.649 --> 00:96:36.850
positive um uh input from on relationships as adults that

1396
00:96:36.859 --> 00:96:42.918
has been relatively uh well documented also the opposite.

1397
00:96:42.930 --> 00:96:46.000
Um I have seen and I have um very interesting

1398
00:96:46.009 --> 00:96:49.369
as I've, I very recently um was part in

1399
00:96:49.378 --> 00:96:53.409
a, in a session with a um with a

1400
00:96:53.418 --> 00:96:56.743
therapist. Um where, where this was really interesting

1401
00:96:56.752 --> 00:96:58.692
to, to, to see also, you know

1402
00:96:58.703 --> 00:97:00.811
, to go a little bit away from the Ivory

1403
00:97:00.823 --> 00:97:02.832
tower and from the theoretical research and, and look

1404
00:97:02.841 --> 00:97:05.012
into how it is plays out in real life and

1405
00:97:05.152 --> 00:97:09.012
, and where you could really um follow and monitor

1406
00:97:09.021 --> 00:97:11.743
what happened there. So yes, also if you

1407
00:97:11.752 --> 00:97:16.055
have um experienced a secure um attachment style and you've

1408
00:97:16.064 --> 00:97:18.685
developed a uh in a model of a secure attachment

1409
00:97:18.694 --> 00:97:23.965
style because of uh safe and um your needs were

1410
00:97:23.975 --> 00:97:26.136
well met, emotional needs were well met, met

1411
00:97:26.145 --> 00:97:30.206
in childhood. But then growing up, especially in

1412
00:97:30.215 --> 00:97:33.326
um in adolescence where you have a very strong reorganization

1413
00:97:33.335 --> 00:97:36.826
of your um neuroplastic neuro organization of your brain.

1414
00:97:38.166 --> 00:97:43.229
Um Then you again, um uh if you're there

1415
00:97:43.239 --> 00:97:47.048
exposed to um severe disappointments, actually, this can

1416
00:97:47.060 --> 00:97:51.720
cause um a change in, in, in the

1417
00:97:51.729 --> 00:97:55.430
attachment style. Yeah, that not of course,

1418
00:97:55.439 --> 00:97:58.720
not, not uh to, to your primary caregivers

1419
00:97:58.729 --> 00:98:00.989
, but then to how you interact with further with

1420
00:98:01.000 --> 00:98:03.878
other partners. Yeah, or a a actually that

1421
00:98:03.890 --> 00:98:06.609
last point that you mentioned there is it possible for

1422
00:98:06.619 --> 00:98:12.659
us to have different kinds of attachment styles with different

1423
00:98:12.668 --> 00:98:16.310
people that treat us differently? That is interesting.

1424
00:98:16.319 --> 00:98:19.458
That is interesting and that was by no means um

1425
00:98:19.470 --> 00:98:25.199
covered in the original um attachment theory. However,

1426
00:98:25.208 --> 00:98:28.069
there is more and more evidence point in this direction

1427
00:98:28.100 --> 00:98:31.208
. Yes. Um And this is especially fostered if

1428
00:98:31.220 --> 00:98:34.560
you have grow if you grew, grew up in

1429
00:98:34.569 --> 00:98:39.369
a family when you had several siblings, because there

1430
00:98:39.378 --> 00:98:43.579
you developed kind of different kind of models um di

1431
00:98:43.949 --> 00:98:47.359
mo models with different people. So yes, but

1432
00:98:47.369 --> 00:98:49.399
it's, it's also true because you can have different

1433
00:98:49.409 --> 00:98:51.609
attachment style to your father and your to your mother

1434
00:98:51.619 --> 00:98:54.600
. So even there, you can can can also

1435
00:98:54.609 --> 00:98:56.739
have it. And Um So, so, yeah

1436
00:98:56.750 --> 00:98:57.850
. Yeah. Yeah, this is, this is

1437
00:98:57.859 --> 00:99:00.378
more recent study as far as I know, but

1438
00:99:00.390 --> 00:99:02.789
uh very interesting. Yeah. OK. So,

1439
00:99:02.798 --> 00:99:06.100
uh I would like to go through resilience now and

1440
00:99:06.109 --> 00:99:11.829
then after resilience, I have just one last general

1441
00:99:11.838 --> 00:99:15.009
question to ask you. But what is resilience then

1442
00:99:15.020 --> 00:99:18.949
? What does it mean? Psychologically speaking to be

1443
00:99:18.958 --> 00:99:24.899
a resilient person? And I, we develop resilience

1444
00:99:24.909 --> 00:99:29.609
since we've already talked about uh attachment styles, for

1445
00:99:29.619 --> 00:99:34.869
example, and living in unpredictable and helpless environments and

1446
00:99:34.878 --> 00:99:39.168
the effects that that has on our psychology. So

1447
00:99:39.369 --> 00:99:43.529
how do we develop resilience? Very good. Yeah

1448
00:99:43.560 --> 00:99:46.878
. Um actually, probably the most important question and

1449
00:99:46.890 --> 00:99:49.729
in my book, I unfortunately, really only dedicate

1450
00:99:49.909 --> 00:99:55.289
the last bit to it um because that was not

1451
00:99:55.298 --> 00:99:57.600
the main focus, but uh I think this is

1452
00:99:57.609 --> 00:100:00.390
something that needs to be developed much more. So

1453
00:100:00.399 --> 00:100:04.220
what is resilience resilience is in the face of advertises

1454
00:100:04.829 --> 00:100:11.609
uh it uh you can overcome these negative uh these

1455
00:100:11.619 --> 00:100:16.029
negative uh experiences and uh you can still grow actually

1456
00:100:16.039 --> 00:100:17.770
, it's even more than that, you cannot only

1457
00:100:17.779 --> 00:100:21.970
overcome but you, you get even stronger. So

1458
00:100:21.979 --> 00:100:30.529
, um and this um research has originally started um

1459
00:100:30.539 --> 00:100:38.989
by Emy Vanna and she looked at um Children in

1460
00:100:39.000 --> 00:100:44.149
uh at the Hawaiian Island of Kawai. And um

1461
00:100:44.628 --> 00:100:46.140
many of these Children grew up in, in,

1462
00:100:46.149 --> 00:100:51.149
in really severe poverty. And um a lot of

1463
00:100:51.159 --> 00:100:56.739
these Children later in life in their teenage years and

1464
00:100:56.750 --> 00:100:59.699
later in life, then I had destructive or self

1465
00:100:59.708 --> 00:101:05.569
destructive behavior and ended up being alcoholics or um committing

1466
00:101:05.579 --> 00:101:10.329
suicide or having very unstable partnerships and so on.

1467
00:101:10.560 --> 00:101:14.850
However, really surprising it was in the same population

1468
00:101:14.859 --> 00:101:16.259
under very, very similar, if not the same

1469
00:101:16.270 --> 00:101:21.298
circumstances about a third of these Children uh did not

1470
00:101:21.310 --> 00:101:26.819
develop these destructive behaviors. So they were kind of

1471
00:101:26.829 --> 00:101:29.810
resilient. They developed, they succeeded in life,

1472
00:101:29.819 --> 00:101:33.000
they flourished. They actually, despite all these adversaries

1473
00:101:33.048 --> 00:101:36.789
, they, they grew stronger and they um yeah

1474
00:101:36.798 --> 00:101:40.109
, they, they were on top of their lives

1475
00:101:40.119 --> 00:101:42.509
. Now, what she found out and that has

1476
00:101:42.520 --> 00:101:46.939
been confirmed by many other studies is um these Children

1477
00:101:46.949 --> 00:101:51.798
who did not um go into this self destructive or

1478
00:101:51.810 --> 00:101:58.270
destructive pathway. Uh were those who had um at

1479
00:101:58.279 --> 00:102:01.418
least one person who cared for them and it does

1480
00:102:01.430 --> 00:102:05.298
did not even have to be the primary caregiver like

1481
00:102:05.310 --> 00:102:08.338
the mother or the father. It was in some

1482
00:102:08.350 --> 00:102:12.470
cases, it was a teacher or something and this

1483
00:102:12.759 --> 00:102:17.390
caring person kind of counterbalance, then all these adversaries

1484
00:102:17.399 --> 00:102:23.689
including missing parental bonds and alcoholism and drugs and poverty

1485
00:102:23.699 --> 00:102:27.069
and so on. So um yeah, that,

1486
00:102:27.079 --> 00:102:29.869
that uh yeah, that, that, that was

1487
00:102:29.878 --> 00:102:31.060
I think kind of this is what was when this

1488
00:102:31.069 --> 00:102:36.168
resilient research was born. And now obviously this is

1489
00:102:36.180 --> 00:102:42.289
a really powerful message because that means that at least

1490
00:102:42.298 --> 00:102:46.659
one caring person, her child um should help a

1491
00:102:46.668 --> 00:102:53.378
child to develop uh into a um an adult that

1492
00:102:53.390 --> 00:102:57.189
uh can master his or her life. Now,

1493
00:102:57.270 --> 00:103:00.930
in some cases, this is, this is not

1494
00:103:00.939 --> 00:103:04.000
easily possible. There is the caregivers are missing.

1495
00:103:04.250 --> 00:103:06.930
So you asked me, so what, what are

1496
00:103:06.939 --> 00:103:11.069
the factors? So how can we contribute um to

1497
00:103:11.079 --> 00:103:14.500
, to making Children more resilient? And here I

1498
00:103:14.509 --> 00:103:19.289
draw from um insights that come actually ff from uh

1499
00:103:19.298 --> 00:103:26.489
a few insights um but amongst others um that come

1500
00:103:26.500 --> 00:103:28.869
from, from the so called circle of courage that

1501
00:103:28.878 --> 00:103:34.750
was developed by um the Indi Indi indigenous population of

1502
00:103:34.759 --> 00:103:42.199
um Northern America. They um showed that some of

1503
00:103:42.208 --> 00:103:49.600
the uh the um important key factors that they need

1504
00:103:49.609 --> 00:103:53.399
or elements that they need to support Children to,

1505
00:103:53.409 --> 00:103:57.659
to grow and to, to develop healthily that are

1506
00:103:57.668 --> 00:104:00.930
actually um can that, that are going across cultures

1507
00:104:00.939 --> 00:104:02.798
. So that's holds true for all, all,

1508
00:104:02.810 --> 00:104:05.838
all cultures. And the first thing you need is

1509
00:104:05.850 --> 00:104:10.989
to establish uh secure a safe environment. So this

1510
00:104:11.000 --> 00:104:13.949
before you do any other interventions, this the first

1511
00:104:13.958 --> 00:104:16.949
thing is the child has to be safe, take

1512
00:104:16.958 --> 00:104:20.668
him her out of the unsafe environment, provide an

1513
00:104:20.680 --> 00:104:25.180
environment where he or she feels safe. And then

1514
00:104:25.270 --> 00:104:28.069
the other four points come from the uh circle of

1515
00:104:28.079 --> 00:104:30.918
courage. And the first one is um establish an

1516
00:104:30.930 --> 00:104:34.939
emotional bond. So make sure that there is a

1517
00:104:34.949 --> 00:104:36.829
sense of belonging. This is the first one.

1518
00:104:36.838 --> 00:104:41.659
The second one is um they call it mastery,

1519
00:104:41.890 --> 00:104:45.409
put some challenge, but only those challenges that can

1520
00:104:45.509 --> 00:104:48.619
realistically be mastered by the child, you know.

1521
00:104:48.628 --> 00:104:51.970
Um So, so I think um Levitsky would call

1522
00:104:51.979 --> 00:104:56.140
this the zone of proximal development, help the child

1523
00:104:56.739 --> 00:104:59.239
, but make sure it's possible for the child to

1524
00:104:59.250 --> 00:105:03.439
master it. So um offering learning increasingly complex tasks

1525
00:105:03.449 --> 00:105:04.750
for learning. So this is the second one,

1526
00:105:04.759 --> 00:105:10.199
the third one, shift the power to the learner

1527
00:105:10.458 --> 00:105:15.819
. So provide him or her with agency self actualization

1528
00:105:15.119 --> 00:105:17.819
, give the faith into his or her hand.

1529
00:105:18.289 --> 00:105:20.779
Um And the last thing is, and this is

1530
00:105:20.789 --> 00:105:25.189
something that I feel that society is missing more and

1531
00:105:25.199 --> 00:105:30.399
more of it is that build a relationship of reciprocity

1532
00:105:30.439 --> 00:105:33.100
. That means altruism, that means empathy, make

1533
00:105:33.109 --> 00:105:39.899
sure that the child understands um that for whatever he

1534
00:105:39.909 --> 00:105:43.140
or she gives he or she gets things in return

1535
00:105:43.149 --> 00:105:45.739
in a very positive way. So these, these

1536
00:105:45.750 --> 00:105:47.489
are kind of the, the the the the four

1537
00:105:47.500 --> 00:105:50.588
points of the circle of courage and the sa safety

1538
00:105:50.600 --> 00:105:54.079
part. So this is kind of um yeah,

1539
00:105:54.088 --> 00:105:57.439
what I I think that the most important takeaway messages

1540
00:105:57.449 --> 00:106:00.609
from how to build resilience. OK. So one

1541
00:106:00.619 --> 00:106:05.109
more question about resilience then because you were talking mostly

1542
00:106:05.119 --> 00:106:09.810
if I understood it correctly, mostly about Children there

1543
00:106:10.119 --> 00:106:14.208
. But what if the person is already an adult

1544
00:106:14.479 --> 00:106:18.904
and they have gun through an entire childhood and life

1545
00:106:19.234 --> 00:106:23.305
of trauma? Do you think that perhaps there might

1546
00:106:23.314 --> 00:106:28.833
be cases where unfortunately it's already too late to help

1547
00:106:28.845 --> 00:106:31.904
uh those people? Yeah. So I mean,

1548
00:106:32.125 --> 00:106:35.543
I would never ever uh say it's too late because

1549
00:106:35.555 --> 00:106:39.994
I think nobody deserves that. Everybody needs um people

1550
00:106:40.003 --> 00:106:43.944
who believe in them and who support them. However

1551
00:106:43.963 --> 00:106:48.560
, um I have investigated, looked and also um

1552
00:106:48.569 --> 00:106:51.060
I in, in, from practical examples which I've

1553
00:106:51.069 --> 00:106:55.520
seen, there are some cases which would require an

1554
00:106:55.529 --> 00:107:00.979
immense effort and very often um people do not believe

1555
00:107:00.989 --> 00:107:04.399
anymore that this is possible. So, and then

1556
00:107:04.409 --> 00:107:06.789
you have the, the, the, the first

1557
00:107:06.798 --> 00:107:11.699
step is not even initiated because if you are already

1558
00:107:11.708 --> 00:107:15.500
working with a client or if um a grown up

1559
00:107:15.509 --> 00:107:18.878
thinks that there is no chance for him or her

1560
00:107:18.890 --> 00:107:25.739
for happiness, for partnership or something because of severe

1561
00:107:25.759 --> 00:107:30.439
um trauma experienced. Um And in my book,

1562
00:107:30.449 --> 00:107:33.949
I give a few historical examples. Um one from

1563
00:107:33.958 --> 00:107:39.970
the uh Canadian um uh Children, the Du Plessis

1564
00:107:39.979 --> 00:107:43.529
uh Children who, who grew up in these orphanages

1565
00:107:44.399 --> 00:107:47.640
in Canada. Um If you don't give yourself a

1566
00:107:47.649 --> 00:107:51.088
chance, then I think it's difficult because in the

1567
00:107:51.100 --> 00:107:55.970
end, it must come from uh your own willingness

1568
00:107:55.979 --> 00:108:00.949
to um to become resilient, to flourish to,

1569
00:108:00.958 --> 00:108:04.119
to um yeah, to shape your future. Mhm

1570
00:108:05.310 --> 00:108:10.048
So uh I would like to ask you uh just

1571
00:108:10.060 --> 00:108:14.329
to wrap up the interview, a final question about

1572
00:108:14.338 --> 00:108:16.779
uh a, a broad topic of your book that

1573
00:108:16.789 --> 00:108:21.088
is actually something that you introduce the book with.

1574
00:108:21.159 --> 00:108:25.310
And I think that we have already at least several

1575
00:108:25.319 --> 00:108:30.588
times mentioned or referenced it indirectly during our conversation.

1576
00:108:30.600 --> 00:108:34.229
But when it comes to the study of human psychology

1577
00:108:34.239 --> 00:108:36.930
, specifically, what do you think it's important for

1578
00:108:36.939 --> 00:108:42.560
people to keep in mind about how science works and

1579
00:108:42.569 --> 00:108:44.529
how it is done? Because of course, we've

1580
00:108:44.539 --> 00:108:48.020
talked here about several different paradigms and disciplines. We've

1581
00:108:48.029 --> 00:108:54.009
talked about behavior, genetics, developmental psychology, neuroscience

1582
00:108:54.310 --> 00:108:57.548
, uh uh and, and particular kinds of paradigms

1583
00:108:57.560 --> 00:109:01.609
like dynamical systems theory and its counterparts. So,

1584
00:109:02.119 --> 00:109:05.579
w what do you think uh would be important for

1585
00:109:05.588 --> 00:109:11.319
people to keep in mind when they are working through

1586
00:109:11.329 --> 00:109:15.699
the lens of a particular paradigm in science that perhaps

1587
00:109:15.708 --> 00:109:18.310
might be bounded, that is usually bounded by particular

1588
00:109:18.319 --> 00:109:25.378
axioms, methodological presuppositions, techniques, concepts, and

1589
00:109:25.390 --> 00:109:29.449
so on. Mhm um Well, first of all

1590
00:109:29.458 --> 00:109:31.759
, let me just pick up on something you already

1591
00:109:31.770 --> 00:109:35.409
said is I think when we talk about studying the

1592
00:109:35.418 --> 00:109:40.350
human minds, then uh this is such a complex

1593
00:109:40.359 --> 00:109:45.850
task that this requires anyway, an interdisciplinary endeavor.

1594
00:109:45.859 --> 00:109:48.119
So there is no chance that any discipline has the

1595
00:109:48.128 --> 00:109:53.591
privilege over another discipline to elucidate the more important mechanisms

1596
00:109:53.601 --> 00:109:56.641
or more important processes. So I really think and

1597
00:109:56.650 --> 00:110:00.202
that needs to be fostered that there is a collaboration

1598
00:110:00.211 --> 00:110:03.801
between scholars from the natural sciences, social sciences and

1599
00:110:03.811 --> 00:110:08.131
humanities. So, and that also should sink into

1600
00:110:08.141 --> 00:110:12.372
the brains of the natural scientists. II, I

1601
00:110:12.381 --> 00:110:15.523
said it on purpose now um to, to your

1602
00:110:15.533 --> 00:110:18.042
question about um what do we have to keep in

1603
00:110:18.054 --> 00:110:20.323
mind when we talk about how, how the science

1604
00:110:20.332 --> 00:110:24.172
work as such. So one of the things in

1605
00:110:24.184 --> 00:110:26.363
here I speak from the point of view of a

1606
00:110:26.373 --> 00:110:29.764
natural scientists. So as a researcher, you always

1607
00:110:29.773 --> 00:110:32.212
want to be really objective, you want to avoid

1608
00:110:32.264 --> 00:110:34.563
, you said it looking through the lens of some

1609
00:110:34.573 --> 00:110:39.654
paradigms, you want to avoid that you're uh affected

1610
00:110:39.666 --> 00:110:44.154
by some I don't know, spurious cases, anecdotal

1611
00:110:44.166 --> 00:110:47.625
evidences uh or you want to avoid to become overly

1612
00:110:47.636 --> 00:110:51.206
attached to certain theory because this is something you have

1613
00:110:51.215 --> 00:110:56.654
found or uh because then you will be less open

1614
00:110:56.666 --> 00:111:00.215
to critique to this proof, to counterfactual. Now

1615
00:111:00.500 --> 00:111:04.259
, um since I've been uh here at the Conrad

1616
00:111:04.270 --> 00:111:08.899
Lawrence Institute uh for Evolution and cognition research, we

1617
00:111:08.909 --> 00:111:14.600
were highly inter disciplinary institution um where natural scientists uh

1618
00:111:14.609 --> 00:111:17.470
people from the humanities, especially philosophers and historians of

1619
00:111:17.479 --> 00:111:23.000
science work together. And um the longer I've been

1620
00:111:23.009 --> 00:111:25.439
here, the more I've discussed with people, the

1621
00:111:25.449 --> 00:111:29.520
more obvious it is to me that true objectivity in

1622
00:111:29.529 --> 00:111:32.088
science is really a naive idea. Yeah. So

1623
00:111:32.100 --> 00:111:35.399
you already pointed that out. So this is you

1624
00:111:35.409 --> 00:111:41.009
, we are, our research is always somehow bounded

1625
00:111:41.020 --> 00:111:46.259
by some axioms. Um And it is kind of

1626
00:111:46.270 --> 00:111:50.168
rooted very often also in, in a certain zeitgeist

1627
00:111:50.180 --> 00:111:54.409
. So we're following what's popular at the moment.

1628
00:111:55.079 --> 00:112:01.088
Um No, I think we agree here. Science

1629
00:112:01.100 --> 00:112:09.270
here is needed almost ex is not totally exact,

1630
00:112:09.279 --> 00:112:12.390
not always correct. Certainly, it's not objective,

1631
00:112:12.399 --> 00:112:15.168
it's not unbiased. Yeah, this is very surprising

1632
00:112:15.180 --> 00:112:19.430
to a layperson even maybe even surprising to young researchers

1633
00:112:19.439 --> 00:112:23.189
, young scientists. Yeah, we have this really

1634
00:112:23.199 --> 00:112:27.199
idealistic idea. Yeah. So I think we,

1635
00:112:27.208 --> 00:112:30.220
we the two of us agree on that now as

1636
00:112:30.229 --> 00:112:33.489
also many scientists, most scientists will probably agree to

1637
00:112:33.500 --> 00:112:38.208
that. However, I think they will not admit

1638
00:112:38.220 --> 00:112:43.509
that uh very openly. Uh although they know that

1639
00:112:43.520 --> 00:112:46.279
um the research is based on who is doing actually

1640
00:112:46.289 --> 00:112:50.079
that the, the, the experiment um which methodology

1641
00:112:50.088 --> 00:112:54.409
is used, which expe uh instruments are used now

1642
00:112:54.418 --> 00:112:59.289
. But if I don't admit to that, then

1643
00:112:59.390 --> 00:113:04.628
um this is maybe a, a self defense mechanism

1644
00:113:04.640 --> 00:113:11.979
because then uh you do not further um kind of

1645
00:113:12.270 --> 00:113:17.810
uh uh uh challenge or you do not um uh

1646
00:113:17.819 --> 00:113:24.100
ignite further distrust uh of the public in science because

1647
00:113:24.109 --> 00:113:26.369
we, we want the public to trust us.

1648
00:113:27.909 --> 00:113:30.878
But I, for my part, I see that

1649
00:113:30.890 --> 00:113:32.109
in a really different way. I think one of

1650
00:113:32.119 --> 00:113:35.619
the most important endeavors of research is to grapple exactly

1651
00:113:35.628 --> 00:113:39.819
with these issues, to look at the reality of

1652
00:113:39.829 --> 00:113:45.100
scientific constructs to see. Um what is this demarcation

1653
00:113:45.109 --> 00:113:46.899
? Where is science? And, and what,

1654
00:113:46.909 --> 00:113:50.048
what is pseudoscience? For example, what are the

1655
00:113:50.060 --> 00:113:57.000
problems with inductive inferences? Yeah. Can I um

1656
00:113:57.759 --> 00:114:03.239
or how can I establish whether um I there there

1657
00:114:03.250 --> 00:114:08.779
are some systematic bias in my research um that may

1658
00:114:08.789 --> 00:114:12.729
distort them the research processes. So, um I

1659
00:114:12.739 --> 00:114:15.989
think all these things have to be addressed, they

1660
00:114:15.000 --> 00:114:18.600
must be addressed otherwise we end up uh running into

1661
00:114:18.609 --> 00:114:24.970
the problem that uh were no longer trustworthy. And

1662
00:114:24.979 --> 00:114:28.918
after all, I think uh science is always or

1663
00:114:28.930 --> 00:114:32.569
doing research is always a process of the best approximation

1664
00:114:32.619 --> 00:114:38.449
where we very often take wrong tracks along the way

1665
00:114:38.479 --> 00:114:42.958
. And very only occasionally we have a few breakthroughs

1666
00:114:43.250 --> 00:114:46.088
. So I think we really need to continuously challenge

1667
00:114:46.100 --> 00:114:49.279
our own views and uh we have to question our

1668
00:114:49.289 --> 00:114:53.329
pet hypothesis, although we might have grown fond of

1669
00:114:53.338 --> 00:114:57.119
it. And um this would be the only way

1670
00:114:57.128 --> 00:115:01.119
how to make genuine advancements towards an understanding how the

1671
00:115:01.128 --> 00:115:04.779
human mind works. Mhm Yeah. A and by

1672
00:115:04.789 --> 00:115:08.048
the way, if I may and, and if

1673
00:115:08.060 --> 00:115:10.588
you disagree with something, I'm about to say,

1674
00:115:10.600 --> 00:115:12.798
please uh tell me. But I, if I

1675
00:115:12.810 --> 00:115:15.649
may add, I just wanted to say that I

1676
00:115:15.659 --> 00:115:17.739
guess we have to keep in mind that science is

1677
00:115:17.810 --> 00:115:23.588
uh human institution. It's done by humans, the

1678
00:115:23.600 --> 00:115:29.859
scientific method or methods themselves are ever evolving because as

1679
00:115:29.869 --> 00:115:31.869
we develop new techniques, as we, we uh

1680
00:115:31.878 --> 00:115:38.128
discover new theoretical developments and so on the way science

1681
00:115:38.140 --> 00:115:40.859
is done now is not the way it was done

1682
00:115:40.890 --> 00:115:44.289
100 years ago and 100 years from now, it

1683
00:115:44.298 --> 00:115:48.109
will be completely different for sure. And also I

1684
00:115:48.119 --> 00:115:51.838
guess that there's a very simple idea or at least

1685
00:115:51.850 --> 00:115:54.989
you can put it in simple terms, but it's

1686
00:115:55.000 --> 00:115:58.939
more complex than it seems that many people who are

1687
00:115:58.949 --> 00:116:03.979
science communicators are always uh s uh telling people about

1688
00:116:03.989 --> 00:116:10.128
there is and that uh there's no definitive truth in

1689
00:116:10.140 --> 00:116:15.529
science, truth is ever evolving. But sometimes curiously

1690
00:116:15.539 --> 00:116:18.409
enough, uh, scientists and people who are interested

1691
00:116:18.418 --> 00:116:21.668
in science like myself, uh uh I mean,

1692
00:116:21.680 --> 00:116:26.168
sometimes we, uh we are tempted to treat certain

1693
00:116:26.708 --> 00:116:30.418
discoveries in science like dogmas. And, uh curiously

1694
00:116:30.430 --> 00:116:36.000
enough, uh, there are debates sometimes between scientists

1695
00:116:36.009 --> 00:116:40.739
and religious people and they are always telling the religious

1696
00:116:40.750 --> 00:116:43.390
person, oh, you shouldn't trust what the Bible

1697
00:116:43.399 --> 00:116:45.958
says because that's dogma, that's just a book and

1698
00:116:45.970 --> 00:116:47.989
so on. And so for then when it comes

1699
00:116:48.000 --> 00:116:53.199
to some of their own pet hypothesis theories and so

1700
00:116:53.208 --> 00:116:57.458
on, interestingly, it seems that they are treating

1701
00:116:57.470 --> 00:117:00.430
them like dogma like the religious people do, which

1702
00:117:00.439 --> 00:117:04.399
is also interesting because that makes us closer perhaps to

1703
00:117:04.409 --> 00:117:10.159
certain pseudo scientists or anti scientists. Then we would

1704
00:117:10.168 --> 00:117:14.329
like to admit at least in certain cases because we

1705
00:117:14.338 --> 00:117:15.600
are all human anyways. But I mean, I

1706
00:117:15.609 --> 00:117:19.088
guess that's what I would like to add what you

1707
00:117:19.100 --> 00:117:25.270
said. I fully agree to it. Ok.

1708
00:117:25.279 --> 00:117:29.359
So Doctor Sarto Jackson, uh the book again is

1709
00:117:29.369 --> 00:117:32.520
the making and breaking of minds how social interactions shape

1710
00:117:32.529 --> 00:117:34.359
the human mind. I'm of course, leaving a

1711
00:117:34.369 --> 00:117:38.439
link with the description box of the interview. And

1712
00:117:38.449 --> 00:117:41.529
would you like just to tell people before we go

1713
00:117:41.539 --> 00:117:45.199
where they can find you on the internet? Yes

1714
00:117:45.208 --> 00:117:46.359
. So, uh first of all, thank you

1715

very much for giving me the opportunity. It was

1716
00:117:48.548 --> 00:117:51.088
