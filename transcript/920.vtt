00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.160
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.090
Decent. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.579
today I'm joined by Doctor Jean Manuel Rubin. He

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.380
is a professor of Ancient History at University. He

5
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.399
is a classic, a scholar who specializes in Greek

6
00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.520
antiquity, the historical anthropology of sport and the history

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.370
of social inequalities. And today we're focusing on his

8
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.190
book, The Dangerous Life and Ideas Of Diogenes, The

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.459
Cynic. So Jean Manuel, welcome to the show. It's

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.659
a pleasure to everyone. Thank

11
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.599
you. Thank you. It's a

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.770
pleasure to be there. So, just before we get

13
00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:45.080
into diogenes self, just to get a little bit

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.290
of historical background, historical context to the period where

15
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.369
he lived. So uh back then, uh te tell

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.950
us about this idea about how, how apparently back

17
00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:06.830
then uh many ancient Greek philosophers thought of philosophy

18
00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:10.730
as a way of life. And why perhaps this

19
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:16.190
is relevant for discussing uh diogenes philosophy.

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.400
Yes. Uh You have different uh uh form of

21
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.650
uh Greek and Roman philosophies who are conceived as

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.900
a uh ethic philosophy, meaning philosophy of life, uh

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.000
philosophy, which is providing a kind of uh uh

24
00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.110
moral compass, moral scheme uh to uh organize your

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.800
choices and to decide what is wrong and what

26
00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.550
is right in life. And the, the, the maybe

27
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.889
the beginning of this movement is uh with Socrates.

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.300
And the Diogenes is a pupil of Antisthenes, which

29
00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.099
is who is a pupil of Socrates. So you

30
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.610
have this kind of Greek tradition of uh um

31
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.699
building um schools of thought uh which are a

32
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.199
way of life, ways of life at the same

33
00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.089
time. And cynicism is strongly based on these ideas,

34
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.199
ideas that you cannot be only uh a philosopher

35
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.309
producing ideas, but you have to uh leave them

36
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.889
in your everyday life. So you cannot be only

37
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.000
a scholar. You have to be a kind of

38
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.910
agent of your philosophy.

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.610
And what was basically the context of the wider

40
00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:35.300
Mediterranean world back in the fourth century BC, which

41
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.979
is apparently when Diogenes lived.

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.809
Yeah, he's born at the end of the fifth

43
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.779
century BC and he died during the 300 twenties

44
00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.809
uh around that. Um So, yeah, he's a man

45
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.669
of the fourth century BC. Uh It's a, it's

46
00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.460
an opening world, meaning that there is a kind

47
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.949
of very dynamic international economy at the time and

48
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.199
lots of conflicts too around the Aegean Sea. And

49
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.550
the thing is we have what is interesting is

50
00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.919
there are lots of foreigners moving from one city

51
00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.050
to the other and diogenes was one of them

52
00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.960
because he suffered from an exile. He had to

53
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.559
exile from his city, Sy up on the Black

54
00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:25.255
Greek City and is one of these many thousands

55
00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:28.945
of foreigners going from one city to another. And

56
00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:31.384
the fourth century BC is really a moment when

57
00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:36.835
we see lots of foreigners in different cities, we

58
00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.544
cannot really observe that before. There were some foreigners

59
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.615
at the fifth or the sixth century BC in

60
00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:47.335
the cities, cities were not closed communities but maybe

61
00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:50.309
not so many. Mhm So maybe that's, that's the

62
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.399
first thing. The second thing is you have at

63
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.389
the same time in the fourth century, you have

64
00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:02.779
very little cities, meaning with 3000 inhabitants. And you

65
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:08.899
have also very large ones like Syracuse like Alexandria

66
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.880
at the end of the first century, like Rhodes,

67
00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.410
like Athens and Corinth and Athens and Corinth were

68
00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.369
two of the largest cities of the time. And

69
00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:24.380
Diogenes choose to live alternately in each of them.

70
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.820
He was living during the, during the the winter

71
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.470
in Athens and during the summer in in, in

72
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.019
Corinth. So he was living in very large city

73
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.989
which are very specific kind of city, city with

74
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.339
a lot of different nationalities, people from all over

75
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.940
the Mediterranean world.

76
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.559
So tell us a little bit about perhaps what

77
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.209
were some of the main events in the life

78
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.019
of diogenes that you think really played the biggest

79
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.470
role in shaping his philosophy? Because I mean, I

80
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.040
know that he was exiled at a certain point

81
00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:06.329
and then he leave the situation there in different

82
00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.209
cities. So tell us a little bit about why,

83
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.329
why that happened and why he basically had to

84
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.679
be moving between different cities because I guess that

85
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.929
then later on plays a role in aspects of

86
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.750
his way of thinking and philosophy.

87
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.589
Um YEAH, he is, he is in exile. So

88
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.609
he, he has to flee from his city for

89
00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.309
a very specific reason. He was involved with his

90
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.079
father uh in a kind of uh money counterfeiting

91
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:41.440
affair case. And uh he had to go away

92
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.799
to avoid prison or even execution. So he left

93
00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.679
his city. We don't know exactly when, but it

94
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.399
could be in the 300 sixties around that, that

95
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.000
he had to leave the city. And I think

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.980
his exile in the fourth century BC doesn't mean

97
00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.600
the same maybe or maybe it means the same

98
00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:08.809
as today. It's a very hard uh experiment of

99
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.540
life. It's considered by ancient people as the kind

100
00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:18.320
of ultimate uh detachment, uh ultimate loss. Uh Because

101
00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:20.589
when I was talking about lots of foreigners in

102
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.279
the 400 century world, most of them were coming

103
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.640
back on a regular basis to their city, their

104
00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.700
original cities, they were just moving from one to

105
00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:32.529
the other doing some uh trade, but they were

106
00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:35.424
back to the city. And then you have exiles

107
00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:40.975
and exile is a very complicated thing because then

108
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:45.415
it means you lose your complete social environment, you

109
00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:48.695
lose the ability to get buried when you die

110
00:06:48.894 --> 00:06:52.214
in your, the earth, the ground of your motherland,

111
00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.535
which means a lot to an ancient Greek of

112
00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:58.454
the, of the time. So this, this is the

113
00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:05.029
first really traumatic experience of diogenes uh life. And

114
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.470
um this is the beginning, in fact of his

115
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.920
philosophical career, we don't know if uh two months,

116
00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:16.924
six months, two years, five years uh happened before

117
00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:19.924
or between the exile and the beginning of the

118
00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:22.635
philosophical life. But we know that there is a

119
00:07:22.644 --> 00:07:27.095
kind of very strong link between the two episodes.

120
00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:30.804
Uh The thing is when you lose attached to

121
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:33.885
your, to your city, uh you lose your, your

122
00:07:33.894 --> 00:07:37.255
main belonging, you were suppose in a Greek world,

123
00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:39.565
you are supposed to belong to your family, to

124
00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:43.214
your neighborhood, to your village, to your city mainly.

125
00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:45.660
And then you, you are apart from this uh

126
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.720
belonging and this kind of experience of detachment uh

127
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.269
had a strong effect on uh um the way

128
00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:00.130
uh diogenes conceived his philosophy because cynicism is a

129
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.200
philosophy of detachment. You are, you are supposed to

130
00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:06.679
refuse uh every kind of belonging. You're not supposed

131
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.950
to get married, you're not supposed to build a

132
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:13.140
family. Uh Family is a cultural construct. City is

133
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:16.399
a cultural construct. So uh there is a, there

134
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.790
is a clear link between the experience of exile

135
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.529
and the, the way diogenes shaped uh cynicism philosophy,

136
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.489
cynic philosophy.

137
00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:29.410
So this is one of the main ways we

138
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.919
got into the idea of cosmopolitan, cosmopolitanism, right. Yeah,

139
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.109
this is one of the routes. Uh There is

140
00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:41.390
maybe a second uh context uh element which is

141
00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:45.070
Sinop is the original city. Is a native uh

142
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.359
city, is a city on the south shore of

143
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:52.559
the Black Sea, uh meaning uh north of Asia

144
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.030
Minor. Uh And here at the time, there are

145
00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:00.640
lots of um barbarian uh ethnic. Many of them

146
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.840
were in the Persian Empire and were, which are

147
00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:07.179
in contact with uh Syn O or threatening Syn

148
00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:09.400
up on the other Greek cities of the Black

149
00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:14.159
Sea, meaning that very early diogenes had a personal

150
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:20.299
experience of the relationship with other culture, other ethnic

151
00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:25.440
non-greek uh people. Uh So, so the, the cosmopolitanism,

152
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.960
which is uh which is credited of the invention

153
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.599
um the cosmopolitanism uh is at the same time,

154
00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:36.789
can be understood as a, as a consequence of

155
00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:39.219
his exile. And at the same time, uh of

156
00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:44.080
his experience of uh barbarian uh ethnic and conflicts

157
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.840
in Asia Minor.

158
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.650
Yes. And by the way back then, because uh

159
00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:51.250
in the kind of world we live in nowadays,

160
00:09:51.476 --> 00:09:55.856
things work, I guess very differently. But back then

161
00:09:55.866 --> 00:10:00.866
moving, for example, between cities and between states, I

162
00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:04.625
mean, how hard or easy was it? Because I

163
00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:07.846
mean, I imagine that back then people didn't have

164
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:12.406
really documentation and but then when it came to,

165
00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:15.502
for example, the social and political status of an

166
00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:20.242
exile or someone was not considered a citizen. I

167
00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.781
mean, how did it work back then? I would

168
00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:27.012
imagine it would vary between, for example, city states

169
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:30.151
in Greece, how would they deal with those kinds

170
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:33.911
of people? But how was it back then? A

171
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:35.581
living that way?

172
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.130
Yes. Yes, there are different situations. Every city is

173
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.630
a kind of, is a city state. So it's

174
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.619
a kind of very little nation if you want.

175
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:46.200
So, so, so you have a body of citizens.

176
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.409
They are the one with the power, the political

177
00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.809
power, uh and the the uh judiciary power. So

178
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.780
they, they go, they, they are working in courts,

179
00:10:57.789 --> 00:10:59.770
they are working in the assembly, in the councils,

180
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.250
et cetera, then you are foreigners. So if you

181
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.679
are in exile, uh the normal situation, if you

182
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.609
are free, if you're not a slave, the normal

183
00:11:07.619 --> 00:11:10.030
situation is, is is that you will be a

184
00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:14.030
resident for now. Uh THEN in some very specific

185
00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:19.109
situations, some cities including Athens um build some uh

186
00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:24.309
like exclusive personal status from uh for exiles coming

187
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.429
from a city that is a kind of ally

188
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.099
city. So when you have a civil war in

189
00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:31.799
an allied city and when the democratic people are

190
00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:35.000
exiled from their city, it has happened in the

191
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.250
fifth and the fourth century, we see that Athens

192
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.070
built some very um um exclusive with some privileged

193
00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:45.760
uh personal status for this group of exiles. But

194
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.320
this didn't happen to diogenes when he arrived in

195
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.710
Athens or in Corinth, he was only just a

196
00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:54.359
kind of resident foreigner. So you have to register,

197
00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:57.250
uh and you have to pay taxes as a

198
00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.739
resident foreigner, which is very important. It's not very

199
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.739
expensive, but it's very important because if you don't,

200
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.700
you are suspected to try to pretend you're a

201
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.530
citizen. If you don't pay the foreigner tax, then

202
00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:12.500
you are, you can suffer a trial and there

203
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.169
are some heavy risk uh with that coming. So

204
00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:19.219
uh the the situation where you are moving from

205
00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:21.309
one city to the other is is that you

206
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.530
will be uh if you are there for some

207
00:12:23.539 --> 00:12:26.500
days or some weeks, you will be like a

208
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.169
provisory foreigner and then there is no administration, but

209
00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:32.599
you have no rights either. Meaning that if you

210
00:12:32.609 --> 00:12:36.090
are threatened, beaten, stolen, you have no way to

211
00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:39.039
defend yourself in court. Uh But then when you

212
00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:40.880
are a resident for Rena, then you have a

213
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.700
kind of protection from the city, but you have

214
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.340
no political right, no judiciary, right? Meaning you, you

215
00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.840
cannot, uh you cannot vote in a court, you

216
00:12:50.849 --> 00:12:53.080
cannot vote in an assembly, you cannot be a

217
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:58.690
magistrate. So that's the situation for free people. Of

218
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.609
course, for, if you are suspected to be a

219
00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:03.020
slave, then the situation is even different.

220
00:13:03.229 --> 00:13:06.739
And by the way, diogenes himself was a slave

221
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.260
for a little while.

222
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.659
Yes. Uh DURING the 300 forties, it's been abducted

223
00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:16.340
by pirates, which was a very not, not common

224
00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:19.780
that uh not unusual event. There are lots of

225
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:23.179
pirates in the Aegean and Mediterranean Sea at the

226
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.849
time. And even Alexander, the Great had to uh

227
00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:31.190
to fight against pirates around crete for some time.

228
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.590
Uh And uh yes, so the pirates were attacking

229
00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:40.270
villages, they were abducting people and then uh two

230
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.450
ways. The first way is they were asking for

231
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.210
a ransom and they were giving back the people

232
00:13:45.219 --> 00:13:48.669
they had abducted if they got the ransom. First

233
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:53.299
situation, second situation, they were um going away from

234
00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:55.690
the place where they did the abduction and selling

235
00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.590
everyone on a market slave. That's what happened to

236
00:13:58.599 --> 00:14:01.599
diogenes. It's been uh it's been sold to a

237
00:14:01.609 --> 00:14:07.119
Corinthian uh Man Xenia. And after some years he's

238
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:12.020
been released, freed and franchised. So, yes, he, he

239
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.960
had an exper a personal experience of uh uh

240
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:17.640
slavery. He's not the only philosopher who had that

241
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.849
experience, but he's one, he's one of them and

242
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.619
lots of people had this experience and this fear

243
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.219
to be abducted by pirates. Yes.

244
00:14:26.409 --> 00:14:29.900
Mhm And I mean, of course, I imagine that

245
00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:34.700
he was exposed to different cultures. So was the

246
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.380
uh cultural relativist in any way.

247
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.960
Yes. Uh Yeah, in a way you could, you

248
00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:45.000
could say that he, he, he, he had the

249
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.590
idea that lots of uh things in everyday social

250
00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:55.070
life were culturally, culturally built. So uh he was

251
00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.000
uh looking as most of social conventions as convention

252
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.599
on social customs as customs, meaning for diogenes, marriage

253
00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:09.559
was a cultural uh custom, family was a cultural

254
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.320
uh custom wealth as a cultural custom. So in

255
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.349
a way, uh when you develop this kind of

256
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:20.659
uh um philosophy, you could, you could say you

257
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:23.369
are a cultural relativist meaning that you are. But

258
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.289
the thing is he was, he was not interested

259
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:30.400
in comparing culture was interesting and uh in opposing

260
00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:31.729
culture and nature.

261
00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:35.590
Yeah. And basically, I guess that through his life

262
00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:41.659
experiences, it became easier for him to basically question

263
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:42.390
norms.

264
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.510
He spent most of his life doing that. Absolutely.

265
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.539
Doing, trying to uh to unbuilt uh uh norms

266
00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:55.479
and to, to not, not always to contest them

267
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:58.950
but to question them to, to make people understand

268
00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:02.234
that they were only customs norms and they were

269
00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:06.304
not facts uh by nature. So it was a,

270
00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:10.065
it is a big part of uh uh cynicism

271
00:16:10.075 --> 00:16:13.465
uh that the to, to, to point at uh

272
00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:17.825
culturally built uh ways of life.

273
00:16:17.835 --> 00:16:20.590
Yes. Mhm A and the uh in the book,

274
00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:23.869
you also talk about how one of his ideas

275
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.369
was about attacking uh power, glory and the obs

276
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.210
the obsession some people have with social status. Could

277
00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:34.440
you tell us about that

278
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.390
uh attack, you said glory and of social status

279
00:16:39.429 --> 00:16:41.640
and obsession with social status.

280
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:48.570
In fact, for diogenes, there are important matters, philosophical

281
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.260
ones and they are superficial matters and to Search

282
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.750
for power is a kind of super, super act

283
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.099
to search for glory. If you are an athlete

284
00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:05.479
or political um um leader or a military leader

285
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.060
is a, is a superficial one. And to search

286
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.229
for better status too, meaning that uh for dere,

287
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.900
if you are a slave, you don't need to

288
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.689
search for freedom. If you are a foreigner, you

289
00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:20.348
don't need to search for citizenship. If you are

290
00:17:20.358 --> 00:17:22.969
a citizen, you don't need to search for uh

291
00:17:22.979 --> 00:17:26.920
kind of better political position in your city. All

292
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.099
of these are superficial goals. They are not helping

293
00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:35.130
you uh in a philosophical way to behave uh

294
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:41.500
better uh without um pursuing uh artificial goals. So

295
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.510
uh one of the parts of cynicism was to

296
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.709
point at those um artificial uh artificial goals and

297
00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:53.250
intentions. You are supposed to go back to what

298
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.229
is essential, what is necessary needs uh not nothing

299
00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:01.849
uh extravagant and the power is considered as a

300
00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:05.670
kind of uh useless uh goal and glory to

301
00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:10.109
a athletes are attacked on a regular basis because

302
00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:14.170
they are uh two diogenes, eyes focused uh on

303
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.099
uh the search of glory instead of being focused

304
00:18:17.109 --> 00:18:19.310
on the search of philosophy.

305
00:18:19.989 --> 00:18:23.680
And of course, he ended up living in poverty

306
00:18:23.689 --> 00:18:26.280
most of his life. And in the book, he

307
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.890
talked about how he distinguished between the fact of

308
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.569
poverty and the feeling of poverty. So, what's the

309
00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:36.609
distinction there?

310
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.800
Yes. So it's uh the distinction is very popular

311
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.709
in the philosophical field of the end of the

312
00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:47.329
fifth century and the beginning of the fourth century.

313
00:18:47.449 --> 00:18:52.680
So, eogene is like uh uh um appropriating an

314
00:18:52.689 --> 00:18:55.819
idea that has always been uh that, that has

315
00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:58.660
been, I'm sorry, that has been formulated before him,

316
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.609
by Socrates, by uh antisthenes, by Xenophobe. So it's

317
00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:05.729
a very popular idea uh which is the distinction

318
00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:09.020
between the fact of poverty and the feeling of

319
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:14.780
poverty, meaning uh indigenous point of view, you have

320
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.099
to make a distinction between people who are uh

321
00:19:18.109 --> 00:19:22.550
like uh really poor because they have absolutely nothing

322
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.219
to live and survive and people uh who feel

323
00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:30.750
poor because there are more needs that they have

324
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.430
means, meaning that you can uh extremely wealthy, you

325
00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.260
can be one of the wealthiest men of your

326
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.699
city. But if you have uh piled uh lots

327
00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:46.109
of obligations, uh financial ones, personal ones, maybe you

328
00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:50.939
are in difficulty to face all these obligations. So,

329
00:19:50.949 --> 00:19:53.260
uh the, the idea is that you have to,

330
00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:56.369
to see if someone is rich or poor, you

331
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.869
have to look at what he needs on a

332
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.589
regular basis. So he does he have a frugal

333
00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:04.709
life or not? And what are his means? And

334
00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:06.869
even if you have big means, if you have

335
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.589
bigger needs because you are organizing banquets for your

336
00:20:10.599 --> 00:20:14.069
friends all the time because you are financing very

337
00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:19.270
expensive um programs in the city, et cetera. Maybe

338
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.719
you will suffer from a feeling of poverty, even

339
00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:25.640
if not, if on the paper, you're not poor

340
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.209
at all. So that's a kind of very interesting

341
00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:31.880
distinction because it's, it's been um uh it's still

342
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.459
in use in uh contemporary sociology, the distinction between

343
00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:38.150
fact and feeling of poverty. And it came from

344
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.589
uh those from the Socratic school. In fact, Socrates,

345
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.900
Antisthenes xenophobia, genist. So yes, and this is linked

346
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.060
with um this question, in fact, is linked with

347
00:20:51.069 --> 00:20:54.949
the um a kind of revolution in the intellectual

348
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:57.979
world of the 4th, 5th, 4th century BC, which

349
00:20:57.989 --> 00:21:01.130
is the part of the idea of economy. Um

350
00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:02.930
AT the end of the fifth century and the

351
00:21:02.939 --> 00:21:07.329
beginning of the fourth. So around 400 BC, we

352
00:21:07.339 --> 00:21:11.089
have a series of new words, words uh in

353
00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:15.699
the Greek lexicon were appearing in the language uh

354
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:22.160
meaning uh econom, uh economical, economical, economia, economia, we

355
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.040
gave that gave birth to our economy, uh econom

356
00:21:26.439 --> 00:21:29.390
uh which mean someone which mean a manager of

357
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.359
his household, uh econo, which means uh someone uh

358
00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:40.020
who has some qualities in management in his private

359
00:21:40.449 --> 00:21:44.310
household. Uh What I'm trying to tell is at

360
00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:46.089
the end of the fifth and beginning of the

361
00:21:46.099 --> 00:21:49.829
first century, there are some new words to describe

362
00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:53.150
a reality which is new to Greek Ice at

363
00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:57.430
the time, which is the uh economic management. Before

364
00:21:57.439 --> 00:22:00.930
that nobody has ever developed a kind of uh

365
00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:05.729
thought about this economic world. And suddenly uh it

366
00:22:05.739 --> 00:22:08.369
appears to Greeks that it is, it is something

367
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.219
you have to understand. And uh of course, as

368
00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:13.569
it's the same time when you have a new

369
00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:16.290
discipline appearing, there is no economist at the time.

370
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.339
So all um the people who are thinking about

371
00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:23.469
this new economy are philos of philosophers. So every

372
00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:26.810
uh uh philosophical school of the time uh has

373
00:22:26.819 --> 00:22:32.170
produced some economic treaties about this question of management.

374
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.229
What it is to uh to be rich, to

375
00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:37.310
be poor, what it, how do you organize your

376
00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:40.719
household or how do you manage your slave? How

377
00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:43.270
do you choose your wife, et cetera, which are

378
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.030
considered as economic questions

379
00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:51.109
a and related to his uh to diogenes econom,

380
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:56.469
economic ideas. There's also this idea of his criticizing

381
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:02.589
a system governing the accumulation and distribution of wealth.

382
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.390
Right?

383
00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:08.380
Yes, absolutely. In different ways uh In diogenes, ice

384
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.949
money, coins are a cultural construct. They are useless.

385
00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:16.930
So we shouldn't need coins to, to trade, for

386
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:20.569
example. So that's maybe the first level. But the

387
00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:24.000
second level is that wealth is not a goal.

388
00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:27.760
You, you, you shouldn't try to get richer because

389
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.410
it's useless. You should do the opposite. You should

390
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:36.130
try to feel rich by um decreasing your, your

391
00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.770
needs. So, in the relationship between means and needs,

392
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.619
uh it says, OK, people are focused on increasing

393
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.770
their means. They shouldn't, they should be focused on

394
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.079
decreasing their needs. And this is cynic uh way

395
00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:51.359
of life. You are supposed to live a very

396
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.079
simple, very frugal, very aic oric uh life. So

397
00:23:58.089 --> 00:24:00.979
yes, that's, that's the idea that's uh wealth on

398
00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:05.170
the field of wealth and patrimony and owning uh

399
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.780
is uh something you have to fight against. This

400
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.959
is useless and this is even more useless in

401
00:24:11.969 --> 00:24:15.530
diogenes eyes because you're not supposed to build a

402
00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.209
family on the dynasty. So in Greeks eyes, you

403
00:24:19.219 --> 00:24:22.339
are supposed to build wealth patrimony household because you

404
00:24:22.349 --> 00:24:25.339
want to give it to your heirs. So this

405
00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:27.530
is a family matter, you are supposed to, to

406
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.430
transfer to provide, to increase the family wealth and

407
00:24:31.439 --> 00:24:35.010
to give it to the next generation. And diogenes

408
00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:38.199
says we don't need to make kids and and

409
00:24:38.209 --> 00:24:41.439
we don't need to uh transfer any kind of

410
00:24:41.449 --> 00:24:45.599
wealth. So everything is linked in a way, the

411
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.599
the the need for our family and the need

412
00:24:47.609 --> 00:24:52.270
for the source of wealth are both uh contested

413
00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:53.709
in scenic point of view

414
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.369
and related to the distribution of wealth. Did we

415
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.530
care about economic inequality? For example?

416
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.630
No. Uh YOU couldn't say that really. Uh THERE

417
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.780
is no uh um social conscience in a cynicism

418
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.750
in a way we could say that in a,

419
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.810
in a, in a modern world. Uh FOR, for

420
00:25:15.819 --> 00:25:18.739
diogenes, this is an individual question that is not

421
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.209
really like a social categories uh that we have

422
00:25:22.219 --> 00:25:25.380
to improve the situation as the way to improve

423
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.599
your situation is to live a philosophical life. So

424
00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:32.819
it's not uh um social aid won't help you.

425
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:35.739
Uh Anyway, social aid in the Greek City is

426
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:40.119
a very, very tiny uh uh matter for everyone.

427
00:25:40.219 --> 00:25:43.540
But apart from that endogenous uh point of view,

428
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.900
like you said, with the fact of poverty and

429
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.290
the feeling of poverty, that's what you have to

430
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.010
deal with is this uh ability to feel rich

431
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:55.229
and this is a very individual matter, you have

432
00:25:55.239 --> 00:25:58.890
to face it by yourself. So as long as

433
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.280
you don't, again, for, for cynics, you, you are

434
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.770
not supposed to belong to any kind of category,

435
00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.550
including social category.

436
00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:12.489
And of course, he was also a mendicant philosopher,

437
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.449
he practiced mendicancy. And back then, how did uh

438
00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:22.319
Greeks look at that way of living? I mean,

439
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.989
was that also a sort of violation of some

440
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.160
norms in Greek society?

441
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.040
Yeah, you could say that. Yes. Uh It's uh

442
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.060
um for Greek of the first century, a beggar

443
00:26:37.069 --> 00:26:40.550
is a parasite basically. Uh It is considered as

444
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.619
a parasite because the main um uh the main

445
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.579
social value in the relationship is, is what they

446
00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:51.290
call Philia, which is a known philosophical concept. We

447
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.339
uh we often uh translate it by friendship, but

448
00:26:54.349 --> 00:26:58.140
the the closest translation would be will be reciprocity.

449
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.130
Uh So uh what does it mean? It means

450
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.260
that you are in a world where there is

451
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:07.819
no social security, there is no insurance, meaning that

452
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:11.290
the level of protection on, on security and safe

453
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.489
social safety you can get is heavily linked with

454
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.849
the number of um reciprocal relationship. You build with

455
00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:23.040
people, with your friends, with your family, with your

456
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:27.489
neighbors, with uh the citizens of your city. So

457
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.609
uh you build relationship. What does it mean in

458
00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:31.479
everyday life? It means that if you have a

459
00:27:31.489 --> 00:27:34.839
sacrifice, you sacrifice an animal because you have, you

460
00:27:34.849 --> 00:27:39.380
are uh organizing the wedding of your daughter, for

461
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.589
example. Uh THEN if you don't invite your neighbor,

462
00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:44.829
you will come to your neighbor and you will

463
00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:48.939
give your neighbor a piece of the sacrifice because

464
00:27:48.949 --> 00:27:51.560
maybe in two months, in three months, you will

465
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:53.790
have a problem. You will be on your field

466
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.530
and you will break a tool and you will

467
00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.280
need your neighbor to, to borrow uh a tool.

468
00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:04.160
So uh um that's, that's the way Greeks understand

469
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.000
social life. You are, you are giving to people

470
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.920
and they are giving to you when you need

471
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.079
something. So it works in the family. It works

472
00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:14.560
with one. It, it works with neighbors. The thing

473
00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:17.219
is uh um beggars, they don't, they are not

474
00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:20.560
part of that uh like virtual circle. They are

475
00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:24.119
away from that because they never give anything. Basically,

476
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.819
they only ask for arms. So uh they are

477
00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:31.520
considered as a um lost causes if you want.

478
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.189
There is a uh a Greek proverb saying something

479
00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:37.390
like uh uh not even uh um not even

480
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.670
a beggar's parents or his friends. Uh So So,

481
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.140
meaning that you, if you are a beggar, you

482
00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.209
are alone, you are by yourself. Uh So they

483
00:28:46.219 --> 00:28:50.069
are the, the, the basic conception of a man

484
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.939
decency is that uh beggars are parasites. And then

485
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.810
cynics come and they change the, the, the pattern.

486
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.140
They say uh that of course, they ask for

487
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.130
something, they ask for arms, but in exchange, they

488
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:12.739
provide philosophy, they provide advice, they provide wisdom, they

489
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.939
provide clarity of thinking, et cetera. So they are

490
00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:19.989
giving something in return. And that is a Greek

491
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.819
word to say, to ask for S uh E

492
00:29:23.209 --> 00:29:25.859
and there is a Greek word to say to

493
00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:28.260
give something in return at it. Meaning that in

494
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.160
the, in the Greek conception, in the cynic conception,

495
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:36.760
I mean, uh the fact of begging is not

496
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.920
a parasite attitude. It's a kind of give and

497
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.839
take attitude. So that is what is really new

498
00:29:42.849 --> 00:29:47.979
with uh um uh cynic uh philosophy. It is

499
00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:51.709
um giving birth to the, the idea that a

500
00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:56.000
beggar uh the life of begging can be a

501
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.359
life of philosophy.

502
00:29:58.719 --> 00:30:00.859
And by the way, of course, we tend to

503
00:30:00.869 --> 00:30:05.839
associate diogenes very much with the with these jar.

504
00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:08.540
I mean, many times people talk about it as

505
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.000
being a barrel and not a jar, we can

506
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.640
get into that. But why is the jar so

507
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:21.219
important as a sort of symbol of his life?

508
00:30:21.229 --> 00:30:24.719
Why do people associate him so much with the

509
00:30:24.729 --> 00:30:25.290
jar?

510
00:30:25.939 --> 00:30:29.689
Um BE first, it's a symbol first. It's a

511
00:30:29.699 --> 00:30:35.579
symbol uh of uh um of frugality of uh

512
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:39.880
life of uh uh economy. Uh A very uh

513
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.104
uh OIC life, very simple life. So that's first,

514
00:30:44.114 --> 00:30:45.925
that's a symbol. But the thing is in real

515
00:30:45.935 --> 00:30:48.505
life, that's the way it could be for some

516
00:30:48.515 --> 00:30:52.614
people. Some people were living in empty graves, in

517
00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:56.435
cabins, in huts, in tents and in jars. And

518
00:30:56.444 --> 00:30:59.275
we know that from the fifth century during the

519
00:30:59.285 --> 00:31:02.854
Peronne Asian War, we have some uh text mainly

520
00:31:02.864 --> 00:31:05.064
a text from toy leaders, the historian, the main

521
00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:08.395
historian of the Peronne Asian War. Uh AND he's

522
00:31:08.405 --> 00:31:12.489
explaining and he's giving details about the way um

523
00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:17.349
Athenian people had to leave when they took refuge

524
00:31:17.359 --> 00:31:21.380
inside the walls of the city in 431. And

525
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:28.219
we have information about these temporary shelters, temporary accommodations

526
00:31:28.229 --> 00:31:31.500
and it is empty graves. It is tents and

527
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.729
it is jars. They use jars because those jars

528
00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:37.660
are what Greek call pit oil are very large,

529
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.239
very high ceramic jars. They can be more than

530
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.569
2 m high. We still have some, some of

531
00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:46.800
them thanks to the archaeology of it. And uh

532
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.020
uh they can be very high. They were used

533
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.189
to store food, to store uh uh grain cereals

534
00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:56.189
and different kind of uh different kind of uh

535
00:31:56.199 --> 00:31:58.729
of food. And most of the time they were

536
00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:04.635
put inside the ground like uh uh you have

537
00:32:04.645 --> 00:32:07.224
to dig to put them half of them in

538
00:32:07.234 --> 00:32:10.295
the ground to, to make them stable and then

539
00:32:10.334 --> 00:32:14.665
you could use them in a crisis situation to

540
00:32:14.675 --> 00:32:18.015
live in it. So, and that's what diogenes did

541
00:32:18.025 --> 00:32:20.880
in Athens in the, in the edges of the

542
00:32:20.989 --> 00:32:24.239
Ara, uh, in the metro sanctuary. He had a

543
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.109
jar and he decided to leave to live there.

544
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.579
No, we have no idea how the jar arrived

545
00:32:29.589 --> 00:32:31.180
there, but it must have been a jar from

546
00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:33.969
the sanctuary and then it was empty and uh

547
00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:37.969
someone maybe cleaned it, maybe not. Uh ANYWAY, he,

548
00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:40.410
he used it uh to, to live there for,

549
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.369
for some time. So it's not a tale or

550
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.069
legend. It's a uh it's a normal um uh

551
00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:52.660
crisis uh housing in certain, in certain context. So

552
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.400
when uh when Diogenes in the 300 sixties, 300

553
00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:01.369
fifties did that in Athens, lots of Athenians had

554
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.010
already seen some people living in this kind of

555
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.770
drought. So this is no surprise. Uh FOR them,

556
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.050
this is not a kind of abnormal way of

557
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.050
living. It's not usual on the Agora, but it's

558
00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.689
not totally uh unique or crazy. And then uh

559
00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:23.250
the story has uh changed in Roman times when

560
00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.810
uh Latin philosophers and Latin writers began to tell

561
00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:32.150
Diogenes story in Latin. And they had to translate

562
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.630
from Phos the Greek work to the draw to

563
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.369
a kind of uh Latin equivalent. And they used

564
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.250
uh do mainly uh which is a way to

565
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.079
say barrel, uh a cask, wooden cask. And uh

566
00:33:46.089 --> 00:33:48.689
but when they did that translation, they knew they

567
00:33:48.699 --> 00:33:53.439
were uh um they knew that the original word

568
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:56.550
was meaning ceramic jar. They were just adjusting to

569
00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.500
their uh l uh But then after that, the

570
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.109
memory of that got lost in the way. And

571
00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:08.639
after, during some centuries, we've been uh describing painting,

572
00:34:08.649 --> 00:34:12.478
showing, telling that diogenes lived in a barrel. So

573
00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:16.060
we have lots of uh modern paintings, for example,

574
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.895
with uh Diogenes in um in a barrel and

575
00:34:19.905 --> 00:34:23.813
lots of books talking about Diogenes barrel, which is

576
00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:26.864
a pure le for, this is a pure legend

577
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:29.895
because when Diogenes was alive in the first century

578
00:34:29.905 --> 00:34:34.274
BC, there was no wooden barrel on earth. The,

579
00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:38.054
the first uh cask um the first barrels uh

580
00:34:38.063 --> 00:34:41.668
to store wine uh appeared. Uh We have some

581
00:34:41.678 --> 00:34:45.299
archaeological data and we have some text appeared during

582
00:34:45.309 --> 00:34:49.748
the first century BC. So basically 300 years after

583
00:34:49.768 --> 00:34:52.408
the Eugene's life. So he has never lived in

584
00:34:52.418 --> 00:34:55.829
a barrel in Athens. He lived in a jar

585
00:34:55.839 --> 00:34:58.468
and this jar is uh uh is uh at

586
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:01.029
the same time, a kind of um he is

587
00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:04.509
reflecting the place of the, the role of ceramic

588
00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:07.249
stuff in everyday life. There is a lot of

589
00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:11.830
ceramic uh vessel in uh in uh everyday life

590
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.760
in Athens. At the time, there is a huge

591
00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:19.459
ceramic uh production area in the north of uh

592
00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:20.320
of Athens called Krauss.

593
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.320
Mhm. And of course, as a foreigner and a

594
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.850
mendicant philosopher back then, of course, he had very

595
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.350
low social status. But I guess that a class

596
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.550
of people that probably were even lower in social

597
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.610
status than him were the slaves. And so, because

598
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.189
we've already mentioned, hear that he was a slave

599
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.510
in himself for a while. What ideas did he

600
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.459
have about slaves? I mean, how did they think

601
00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:53.929
about them? Did they think that they were like

602
00:35:53.939 --> 00:35:58.489
other common citizens? They, they were the same as

603
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.090
other people or not?

604
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.709
Yeah. The, the uh uh to diogenes mind it

605
00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:09.399
is status is irrelevant in a way. So you

606
00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:12.350
are as free as you want to be, whatever

607
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.620
is your status. So there is no like a

608
00:36:15.629 --> 00:36:21.209
political claim uh against, against slavery. Um But the

609
00:36:21.219 --> 00:36:24.179
idea is that you um what is interesting uh

610
00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:29.060
diogenes is less slavery than dependence. You are um

611
00:36:29.189 --> 00:36:32.659
you are free if you do not depend, if

612
00:36:32.669 --> 00:36:36.780
you don't depend of any kind of uh uh

613
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:41.429
specific uh need. So you have to, to build

614
00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:46.000
uh the strongest autonomy, you can the strongest freedom

615
00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:49.659
and this you can do inside a slave life.

616
00:36:49.669 --> 00:36:52.159
So the fact that you are a slave doesn't

617
00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:55.790
mean that you cannot live a philosophical life in

618
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.939
diogenes uh point of view. So uh slavery in

619
00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:03.620
a way is not a very um important matter

620
00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:06.469
in a way that uh cynics use it mainly

621
00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:09.689
as a model as a metaphorical model to dependence.

622
00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:11.949
You are, the point is to try not to

623
00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:15.729
be depend of dependent of anything. Meaning that if

624
00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:19.250
you are a master and if you own many

625
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.649
slaves, but if your full life depends on your

626
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:26.260
slave, if you are unable to do anything by

627
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.810
yourself, and if you have a level of comfort

628
00:37:29.189 --> 00:37:32.679
that is uh strongly based on the way you

629
00:37:32.689 --> 00:37:35.610
own slave, you are in fact more a slave

630
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.169
than your slaves. So, so in uh in diogenes

631
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.389
point of view, again, it's a question of uh

632
00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:43.850
we would say to the per personal development. Uh

633
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.219
YOU, you, you have to be able to uh

634
00:37:46.229 --> 00:37:49.949
to build uh a kind of space of freedom

635
00:37:49.959 --> 00:37:52.770
in your life. Whatever is your status. Of course,

636
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.889
if you have a free status, it will be

637
00:37:54.899 --> 00:37:59.034
easier, but uh it will come with more obligations

638
00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:01.925
sometimes. So maybe it will be more difficult in

639
00:38:01.935 --> 00:38:04.205
a way. So when you say that uh slaves

640
00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:08.415
are even a harder situation that uh um foreigners,

641
00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:11.764
in fact with uh beggars, we, we could ask

642
00:38:11.774 --> 00:38:13.875
the question because in a way laves there are

643
00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:17.439
some uh they have some reciprocal relationship with the

644
00:38:17.449 --> 00:38:20.560
master with all the slaves. So they can, they

645
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.540
can have kind of uh some protections in a

646
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:28.040
way that beggars won't get from anyone. So, so

647
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:33.580
sometimes uh slaved as other better lives than beggars

648
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.040
or may maybe a more protected one even.

649
00:38:36.489 --> 00:38:39.909
Mhm Yeah. Perhaps I was thinking more about the

650
00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:44.209
sort of modern point of view where being a

651
00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:48.229
slave would be worse than being a beggar because

652
00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:52.379
at least the beggar would have more freedom. Yeah.

653
00:38:52.389 --> 00:38:55.080
Yeah. But you're on paper, you're absolutely right on

654
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.120
paper. The, the worst stages is to be a

655
00:38:58.129 --> 00:39:01.060
state. But the thing is in everyday life, some

656
00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:05.820
slaves have uh money, have a comfort, comfortable life

657
00:39:05.959 --> 00:39:07.989
and can be protected. Meaning if they have a

658
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.860
value to their master and if they are molested

659
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.780
by someone, the master will prosecute injustice for them.

660
00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:17.479
So uh uh which that this is something that

661
00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:20.060
nobody will do for a be so, so uh

662
00:39:20.169 --> 00:39:22.989
so um that's a complex situation. That's a complex

663
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.620
situation.

664
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:29.419
So, getting into other aspects of diogenes philosophy, it

665
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:36.000
is pleasure, a legitimate desire for diogenes and the

666
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.969
cynics more generally.

667
00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:43.260
Um All the cynics didn't have the same uh

668
00:39:43.969 --> 00:39:47.939
opinion about that. Antinous uh with a kind of

669
00:39:47.949 --> 00:39:53.790
master of Diogenes. Um Antus was refusing pleasure at

670
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.270
least as far as we can understand antinous philosophical

671
00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.340
proposal. So, uh which uh Diogenes didn't do uh

672
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:06.000
part of life. Uh So uh scenic philosophy with

673
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:10.060
diogenes and after diogenes is not uh um refusal

674
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.989
of pleasure, philosophy. Um THE thing is again, is

675
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.209
the question of autonomy and dependence. Pleasure is a

676
00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:20.709
problem. If you are dependent of a pleasure, you

677
00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:23.719
can drink some wine. But if you need to

678
00:40:23.729 --> 00:40:27.620
drink wine every, every week or at every banquet.

679
00:40:27.629 --> 00:40:30.310
There is a problem. You can have a sexual

680
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.770
life. But, uh, if you are addicted to it,

681
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.610
it's a problem. You can, you have the right

682
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.110
to love food and to enjoy a good piece

683
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.669
of bread and nice olive oil. It's no problem

684
00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:45.350
with that. But again, if you cannot live without

685
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.379
it, then it's a problem. So, pleasure is not

686
00:40:48.389 --> 00:40:53.320
in itself, um, uh, has no moral issue or

687
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.719
ethical issue in itself. The question is uh if

688
00:40:56.729 --> 00:40:59.959
you are dependent of one or other kind of

689
00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:00.560
pleasure

690
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:06.580
and, and how did they think about other animals?

691
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:08.850
Did they see? Did they look in any way

692
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.639
at other animals as a possible model for human

693
00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:15.320
conduct? At least to some extent?

694
00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:20.340
Yes. Uh Yeah, the, the the animals are model

695
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.110
to uh to scenic uh meaning that uh they

696
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.139
have an ability uh to uh simplicity, to oar

697
00:41:28.449 --> 00:41:32.139
to uh frugality, which is much bigger than men.

698
00:41:32.149 --> 00:41:33.790
So in the scenic point of view, you have

699
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.459
gods on the top, you have animals in the

700
00:41:37.469 --> 00:41:40.989
middle and you have men in the bottom. So

701
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.780
that's the cynic hierarchy of the uh world in

702
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:49.229
a way. And then you have um wise uh

703
00:41:49.239 --> 00:41:54.409
men, philosophers that sometimes uh can be higher than

704
00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:56.949
the animals, but lower than the gods like in

705
00:41:56.959 --> 00:42:02.290
between. But uh for normal um animals are supposed

706
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.280
to be a model first because they live a

707
00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.629
life of simplicity. They don't have so many needs

708
00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:11.800
uh and they adjust uh their uh needs to

709
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.739
their means. Um So they live a life of,

710
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.989
of frugality and then some specific animals in the

711
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.850
scenic point of view, like dogs will have some

712
00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:24.689
uh uh qualities uh uh that should be inspiring.

713
00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:29.050
Uh DOGS are low. Uh They are honest. Uh

714
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.100
THEY are, again, they live a simple, very simple

715
00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.149
life so you can give them a bone and

716
00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:37.169
they will be very happy with that. So, uh

717
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.850
the, the idea is that the animal world and

718
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:45.090
some of the animals specifically uh can be used

719
00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:48.090
as a model for, for human conduct. Yes.

720
00:42:48.479 --> 00:42:52.830
Mhm. And related some other, let's say norms in

721
00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.610
Greek society. Of course, we've already talked a little

722
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.610
bit here about marriage for example. But what worries

723
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:06.090
views exactly about things like marriage, pity and prostitution.

724
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.760
Um So marriage is a cultural construct in a

725
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.669
scenic point of view. So you are uh you

726
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.810
are not supposed to try to get married. So

727
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.520
we have one exception. Uh uh ONE of diogenes

728
00:43:20.639 --> 00:43:24.239
pupils, Krates who got married with Hipaa. But it

729
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:28.699
was a very strange marriage was basically unbuilding every

730
00:43:28.709 --> 00:43:32.469
rule of uh marriage. So it's not very classical

731
00:43:32.479 --> 00:43:35.399
uh marriage, you could say. So, uh marriage is

732
00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:39.550
a social convention. Uh PACY is, it's a very

733
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.520
common practice in Athens in the fourth century BC,

734
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.250
meaning that uh uh for me, for most of

735
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.350
men, adult men, I mean, free men citizen or

736
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.209
foreigner, but free men. Uh It was normal to,

737
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.590
um, you had like basically two sexual options on

738
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.080
the table if I could say that, um, women

739
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.370
and boys when I say boys, I mean, uh,

740
00:44:03.379 --> 00:44:06.989
boys, uh which are not adults yet. So let's

741
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.899
say 10 to 20 boys if you want 20

742
00:44:09.909 --> 00:44:13.169
years boys. Um So this was considered as a

743
00:44:13.179 --> 00:44:17.570
kind of too equal uh possibility to, uh, to

744
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.290
live a sexual life. And you, lots of men

745
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.260
were leaving the both possibilities in parallel. Uh So

746
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.939
this is a very common way uh um to,

747
00:44:27.949 --> 00:44:30.409
to do things. Uh But we have no uh

748
00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:35.060
not a single detail about any pistic relationship of

749
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:39.040
diogenes. The only anecdotes we have around that are

750
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.419
presenting him as a kind of protector of kids.

751
00:44:42.709 --> 00:44:46.060
Uh Not someone who was uh using them, using

752
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:49.409
them for pleasure or not someone who was using

753
00:44:49.419 --> 00:44:52.850
pacy as a way to educate kids because that's

754
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.649
why that's the way Greeks were describing this social

755
00:44:56.659 --> 00:45:01.889
practice, a way to um get boys to become

756
00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:07.520
uh citizens, adults through a personal, intimate and intellectual

757
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:12.679
relationship. Uh So, uh to, to no marriage, basically,

758
00:45:12.689 --> 00:45:17.189
no pity and uh with prostitution. Uh You asked,

759
00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:19.959
uh we know that he had a personal relationship

760
00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:24.540
with the Athenian uh prostitute but not uh um

761
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.229
not a relationship involving money. So it was not

762
00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:29.610
as far as we know, it was not a

763
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.250
commercial trade uh relationship. It was a kind of

764
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.149
uh love uh uh normal, intimate personal uh relationship.

765
00:45:38.409 --> 00:45:43.530
So, uh um again, with prostitution uh in diogenes

766
00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:47.229
uh conception, apart from his personal life, the, the

767
00:45:47.239 --> 00:45:49.659
question is the level of dependence. So he was

768
00:45:49.669 --> 00:45:53.320
making fun of people were going on a regular

769
00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:57.489
basis to see prostitutes because in diogene ice and

770
00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.100
in scenic Ice, this was a red flag. It

771
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:03.100
meant that you were, you were dependent of it,

772
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.330
of this kind of pleasure. And this was a

773
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.120
problem in a philosophical point of view. If you

774
00:46:08.129 --> 00:46:11.600
cannot live without it, then you have to uh

775
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:15.139
to face the philosophical issue. It is.

776
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.810
Mhm And what were his views on athletic competition?

777
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.129
Exercise and health?

778
00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.340
Um So, so maybe there are two parts. Uh

779
00:46:28.389 --> 00:46:32.020
THE, the, the, the, the, the exercise uh is

780
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.570
uh good in a cen point of view, you

781
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.620
are supposed to uh exercise your body because your

782
00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:42.060
body is the main tool of your everyday philosophy.

783
00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.320
So you are supposed to be uh to try

784
00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.020
to be in good shape, to uh to strengthen

785
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:50.590
your, your, your body, to train it. Uh And

786
00:46:50.709 --> 00:46:54.169
diogenes was known to um even to twist some

787
00:46:54.179 --> 00:46:57.689
athletic exercises like uh uh what you would say,

788
00:46:57.699 --> 00:47:00.179
I am not sure what is the English word

789
00:47:00.189 --> 00:47:02.729
to say that like there was some uh gym,

790
00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:06.840
gymnastic exercises with statue, like statue grabbing, you were

791
00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.479
working with statue with positions, statues that were in

792
00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:14.969
the gymnasium. And instead of using it for wrestling

793
00:47:14.979 --> 00:47:19.790
techniques to, to train some wrestling techniques and attitudes,

794
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:23.689
diogenes was using these statues when they were covered

795
00:47:23.699 --> 00:47:28.330
with snow in winter to grab them and to

796
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:33.330
uh um train to resist to the cold. So,

797
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.169
uh and that's a good anecdote because it's showing

798
00:47:36.179 --> 00:47:40.719
that at the same time to exercise your body,

799
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.250
to strengthen your body was important, but it was

800
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.500
not to uh uh to prepare to some competition

801
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.889
or to improve in some very specific technical uh

802
00:47:52.899 --> 00:47:55.179
sport. And that's why I was saying that there

803
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:57.719
are like two parts to the answer. The first

804
00:47:57.729 --> 00:48:00.409
thing is health is important because the body has

805
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:03.389
to be strong to help the philosophy. But then

806
00:48:03.399 --> 00:48:08.520
sport athletes competition, that's something that has a very

807
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.689
uh strong uh and uh unfavorable opinion because uh

808
00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:17.899
competition again is um a frame to search for

809
00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:22.000
glory. So uh athletes are focused on the search

810
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:25.110
for glory uh which is a problem in a

811
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.560
phys view. We, we talked about it and the

812
00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.669
second is they are uh so focused on that,

813
00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:33.139
that they are only training their body and they

814
00:48:33.149 --> 00:48:36.409
are not um having a kind of uh um

815
00:48:36.419 --> 00:48:41.530
intellectual uh development of education in parallel. So in

816
00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:45.000
diogenes point of view, uh the problem with athletics

817
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.899
is at the same time, the obsession for victory

818
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.459
and the, the fact that you neglect to develop

819
00:48:51.469 --> 00:48:54.520
your mind and not only your, your, your body

820
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:58.860
So the, the view on uh exercise is positive

821
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:02.020
but the view on athletics is negative.

822
00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.780
And of course, another interesting thing about diogenes is

823
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:11.870
that he was all about speaking one's mind freely

824
00:49:11.879 --> 00:49:18.649
and sometimes that would entail insulting reprimanding sarcasm. So

825
00:49:18.659 --> 00:49:20.100
te tell us about that.

826
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:26.330
Um Yeah, that's one of the, um, maybe most

827
00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.199
interesting part of the philosophy of uh cynics are

828
00:49:30.209 --> 00:49:33.379
in a way. Um They, they, they consider, they

829
00:49:33.389 --> 00:49:35.370
have a kind of mission you could say. So

830
00:49:35.379 --> 00:49:39.080
they are trying to get more people come to

831
00:49:39.169 --> 00:49:45.030
philosophy, philosophical ideas, philosophical attitude and, and life. So

832
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.179
you have to go to people and to provide

833
00:49:49.189 --> 00:49:53.389
some philosophical experience by talking with them by dialogue,

834
00:49:53.399 --> 00:49:58.739
et cetera. Uh INCLUDING insult, including uh sarcasm. Every

835
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.070
way is good to uh to um to force

836
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.030
people to philosophy. So the, that's, that's really a

837
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.229
kind of philosophy with uh no old bar in

838
00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:12.139
a way that you, you, you, you uh cynic

839
00:50:12.149 --> 00:50:15.790
philosophers consider they have the right to do everything

840
00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:20.020
if it helps philosophy or if it helps someone

841
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.949
to come to philosophy. So they will use every

842
00:50:22.959 --> 00:50:28.939
means to provoke philosophical conversation, philosophical uh situations. The

843
00:50:28.949 --> 00:50:32.379
key principle is uh what the Greek called parea,

844
00:50:32.389 --> 00:50:35.909
meaning, meaning, uh uh freedom of speech, speaking freely,

845
00:50:35.919 --> 00:50:41.379
speaking tersely, uh uh speaking with no um specific

846
00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:45.179
courts of any kind. Uh Because Cortesi is a

847
00:50:45.189 --> 00:50:47.760
social convention on what you have to do is

848
00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.770
to force people to understand they are not living

849
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.120
a life of philosophy and to try to convince

850
00:50:53.129 --> 00:50:57.219
them to, to try to live a philosophical life.

851
00:50:57.389 --> 00:51:00.250
So, yes, that is uh uh one of the

852
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.360
main tools of uh cynics when they try to

853
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.909
convince other people to come to philosophy is uh

854
00:51:07.919 --> 00:51:12.840
freedom of speech, Parecia. So uh very, sometimes very

855
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:15.800
aggressive way to uh to get in contact with

856
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:16.360
people.

857
00:51:16.889 --> 00:51:20.520
And do you think that his defense of speaking

858
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.419
one's mind and being honest relates in any way

859
00:51:24.459 --> 00:51:29.340
with these hate toward demagogues and populists?

860
00:51:30.889 --> 00:51:32.879
Yes, you, you could say that you could say

861
00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:36.510
that um the thing is uh populist uh in

862
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.290
uh uh political life of uh cities, big cities

863
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.929
or little cities, but mainly big cities like Athens.

864
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:45.350
Um There are people who are trying to get

865
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.649
some political power. Um And we are ready to

866
00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:53.669
say whatever citizens uh want to hear. So, uh

867
00:51:53.679 --> 00:51:57.770
the main uh tool of a populist is to

868
00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.790
lie uh to life, to get uh the power

869
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.219
you want to get to, to be able to

870
00:52:04.379 --> 00:52:07.229
uh decide of some uh of the political lines

871
00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:10.760
of the community. So, uh at the same time,

872
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.270
they are lying, which is uh in a scenic

873
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.639
point of view, uh not an appropriate way of

874
00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:19.639
behaving. And at the same time, they are pursuing

875
00:52:19.649 --> 00:52:22.919
an artificial goal which is power. Uh So they

876
00:52:22.929 --> 00:52:27.679
behave dishonestly on the search for uh something which

877
00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:30.840
is uh in fact useless. So for these two

878
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:35.419
reasons, uh you, you could say that uh um

879
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.889
to speak one's mind is in contradiction with the

880
00:52:38.899 --> 00:52:42.620
populist uh model. So the scenic way of speaking,

881
00:52:42.629 --> 00:52:45.209
one's mind is in contradiction with the, with the

882
00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:47.350
populist and demagogue model. Yes.

883
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:54.280
And, and there are certain very curious supposed episodes

884
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:58.820
in diogenes life, like for example, his supposed encounter

885
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:03.219
with Alexander, the great that people disseminate a lot,

886
00:53:03.229 --> 00:53:06.659
but we are actually not sure if that really

887
00:53:06.669 --> 00:53:08.120
happened, right?

888
00:53:08.639 --> 00:53:13.090
Uh Yeah, we cannot be sure. The thing is

889
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.350
the, the question is, do we have reason to

890
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.560
believe it happened? That's, that's the main question we

891
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.969
could, we could ask. Yes. Uh And uh yes,

892
00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:26.050
we have reason to believe the met. Uh First

893
00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.870
Alexander had a strong interest uh to philosophy. He's

894
00:53:29.879 --> 00:53:33.320
been educated partly by Aristotle and he made several,

895
00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:37.070
he met, sorry, several philosophers through his lives. For

896
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.370
example, Kates when he, when he was in t

897
00:53:39.379 --> 00:53:44.399
uh et cetera. And uh so uh if Alexander

898
00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:48.239
had an opportunity to meet Diogenes, there is no

899
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:51.340
reason to doubt that they didn't meet. And the

900
00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.070
thing is they had some opportunities mainly during the

901
00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:00.179
303 100 in 338 when Diogenes was involved in

902
00:54:00.189 --> 00:54:04.330
the Kona battle in which Alexander was involved too.

903
00:54:04.649 --> 00:54:08.810
Uh And in 336 2 years later, uh Diogenes

904
00:54:09.199 --> 00:54:11.270
was during a part of the year in Athens

905
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.760
during the other part of the year in Corinth.

906
00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:18.500
And Alexander went during that year in those two

907
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.500
cities and even twice in Corinth during that year.

908
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.600
So yes, to answer your question clearly, we cannot

909
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.300
be sure, but we have many good reasons Alexander

910
00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:33.399
would have been interested to meet theogenes. He had

911
00:54:33.409 --> 00:54:37.709
several opportunities to do it. And we have text

912
00:54:37.719 --> 00:54:41.669
describing the uh the encounter, of course, the the

913
00:54:41.679 --> 00:54:44.350
the texts are describing the encounter in a very

914
00:54:44.459 --> 00:54:48.879
legend way. So, so uh behind your question, I

915
00:54:48.889 --> 00:54:50.939
think that's, that's what you mean. Is there, is

916
00:54:50.949 --> 00:54:52.729
there a part of legend in here? And yes,

917
00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:55.760
there, there is, there must be a part of

918
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.909
legend in it. And the legend goes quite far

919
00:54:58.919 --> 00:55:01.270
because the legend tells us that they died the

920
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.370
same day. Uh So they are supposed to have

921
00:55:04.379 --> 00:55:07.229
died the same day. We know exactly when uh

922
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.500
Alexander died during the night of the 10th to

923
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.159
the 11th of June 323. We have no clue

924
00:55:14.729 --> 00:55:17.820
for diogenes. We have some reason to believe he's

925
00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:22.860
dead during the 300 twenties, maybe in 323. This

926
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:25.879
is possible, but we have no detail and clearly

927
00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.399
this detail, the idea that they are, they died

928
00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:32.189
at the exact same day. This is a part

929
00:55:32.199 --> 00:55:34.719
of the legend, Greeks love this kind of uh

930
00:55:34.729 --> 00:55:40.810
synchronic events or alleged synchronic events. So there are

931
00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.719
some parts that are completely probable and some parts

932
00:55:43.729 --> 00:55:46.229
that are um likely legends.

933
00:55:46.399 --> 00:55:50.100
But, but when diogenes died, I mean, as, at

934
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.929
least as far as we know, we must have

935
00:55:52.939 --> 00:55:57.850
been in his, uh, like early eighties or something

936
00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.429
like that.

937
00:55:59.419 --> 00:56:02.449
Yeah, we have, we don't know, we have different

938
00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:05.570
information about the date of birth. So I wouldn't,

939
00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.459
uh, give a precise age but we know he

940
00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:12.020
was around 80 a bit more than, uh, 80.

941
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.790
Yes. Uh, ABSOLUTELY. Uh, IT'S difficult to be more

942
00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.360
uh more precise. Yeah, because we don't know when

943
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.270
he died and we don't know when he's born.

944
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:20.909
So,

945
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.479
yeah. And by the way, when it comes to

946
00:56:24.489 --> 00:56:28.500
his death, how did he die? And in this

947
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.739
particular case, what does it matter? Uh uh THE

948
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.939
the way a philosopher dies does it matter and

949
00:56:36.949 --> 00:56:37.699
why?

950
00:56:38.689 --> 00:56:40.850
Yes. So, so, so for the first part of

951
00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:45.610
your question, we have several um versions of his

952
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.909
death with different, different dates and different context. So

953
00:56:50.919 --> 00:56:52.879
uh for the way he died, we have at

954
00:56:52.889 --> 00:56:55.189
least four different version. One saying that he died

955
00:56:55.199 --> 00:56:59.139
of eating a raw octopus uh trying to demonstrate

956
00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:03.040
that cooking was useless. Um Why one that he

957
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:06.860
died of an infection after being bitten by dogs

958
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:10.489
with which he was disputing a piece of octopus.

959
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.520
Uh One telling us that he died of self

960
00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:16.840
suffocation uh on the car in Khan, on the

961
00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:19.000
heel of the car in Khan with his own

962
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:22.500
cloak. Um One telling us that he died of

963
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.889
fever So of course, he cannot um he, he

964
00:57:26.899 --> 00:57:30.159
cannot have been uh killed by these four reasons.

965
00:57:30.169 --> 00:57:32.520
So most of them are wrong, maybe all of

966
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.699
them, which is likely uh he might have just

967
00:57:35.709 --> 00:57:39.419
died of age. He was a very old man.

968
00:57:39.429 --> 00:57:41.550
And uh so we have, we have no clue.

969
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.229
But I think is why do we have so

970
00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:46.010
many legends? Because exactly that's the question you ask

971
00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:49.399
is, is there a physical way of dying? And

972
00:57:49.409 --> 00:57:52.300
this is, these legends are a way to express

973
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.909
the idea that there is a philosophical way of

974
00:57:54.919 --> 00:57:57.459
uh of dying in ancient times. The death of

975
00:57:57.469 --> 00:58:01.800
a philosopher is supposed to be uh the the

976
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:06.659
last uh demonstration of his philosophy. So uh we

977
00:58:06.669 --> 00:58:11.679
have lots of anecdotes, biographical anecdotes about philosopher showing

978
00:58:11.689 --> 00:58:16.320
that they were um uh either very close to

979
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:19.500
their philosophy when they die when they died or

980
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:24.239
on the contrary, extremely far from their philosophy are

981
00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:27.459
in contradiction with their philosophy when they, when they

982
00:58:27.469 --> 00:58:30.550
died. So there is a uh very uh there's

983
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.120
a huge interest in the scientific uh ancient world

984
00:58:34.129 --> 00:58:38.300
about the death of uh philosophers because again, this

985
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:43.459
is this idea that philosophy uh can be demonstrated

986
00:58:43.469 --> 00:58:46.000
through your actions and your death is in a

987
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.459
way the last even it's the last even of

988
00:58:48.469 --> 00:58:51.260
your life. Did you leave it in a philosophical

989
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:54.459
way or did you not? And diogenes is not

990
00:58:54.469 --> 00:58:58.520
an exception. The legends around his life are in

991
00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.739
a way exploring the idea of, did he, did

992
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.070
he live a scenic death or not?

993
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:09.439
Yeah. The, there's also that, uh tale II, I

994
00:59:09.449 --> 00:59:11.469
would call it a tale because I am not

995
00:59:11.479 --> 00:59:14.679
100% sure if it's true or not, but about

996
00:59:14.689 --> 00:59:19.120
epicurus where I mean, because of the way he

997
00:59:19.129 --> 00:59:22.250
fought about that and now we shouldn't fear death

998
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:27.270
that he apparently, he died with a very severe

999
00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.239
illness and he apparently was suffering a lot. But

1000
00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:33.370
because of his idea of death, he should have

1001
00:59:33.379 --> 00:59:38.709
died peacefully. Right. Yeah, exactly. That's another example, I

1002
00:59:38.719 --> 00:59:41.389
guess. Yeah. Yeah, you have, in fact, uh lots

1003
00:59:41.399 --> 00:59:44.250
of examples that have been gathered by a French

1004
00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.040
researcher some years ago in an article Lucien Jaron,

1005
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.939
which it's an article in French, which is uh

1006
00:59:49.949 --> 00:59:53.360
the southern, the southern way of death of dying

1007
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:56.580
of ancient philosophers. So, yes, you're right there, there

1008
00:59:56.590 --> 01:00:00.032
are lots of examples and some of them are

1009
01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:02.843
dying exactly the way you are. They are expected

1010
01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:05.562
to die and others are like uh in full

1011
01:00:05.572 --> 01:00:07.572
contradiction. So it's, it's a, it's a, it's a

1012
01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:12.312
way, it's a funny part of the philosophical history

1013
01:00:12.322 --> 01:00:13.802
of philosophy, if I could say

1014
01:00:14.732 --> 01:00:18.423
by the way, in, in what ways did die

1015
01:00:19.156 --> 01:00:24.035
is relate philosophically intellectually, of course, to some of

1016
01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:30.075
the other very prominent Greek philosophers like Socrates and

1017
01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:34.275
Plato, they, they have something to say about their

1018
01:00:34.285 --> 01:00:39.135
philosophy or the, their way of doing philosophy or

1019
01:00:39.145 --> 01:00:40.075
something like that.

1020
01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:45.820
Yeah. Uh WI with uh um Diogenes as far

1021
01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.479
as we know, as a kind of uh um

1022
01:00:48.489 --> 01:00:55.479
very critic uh opinion about Socrates and extremely critic

1023
01:00:55.489 --> 01:01:00.750
uh opinion about Plato. Uh THE, the that uh

1024
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.510
he was considering Plato that a kind of um

1025
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.459
ne negation of uh of the principle of uh

1026
01:01:07.469 --> 01:01:11.780
philosophy in action. The, the main critic Diogenes was

1027
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.719
uh uh doing at uh uh Plato and Plato's

1028
01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:16.969
philosophy. That was that he was not living a

1029
01:01:16.979 --> 01:01:21.239
life of philosophy. It was just like producing philosophical

1030
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:24.739
ideas, but you couldn't see. And then in his

1031
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:28.129
uh everyday uh life, so he wasn't, he was

1032
01:01:28.139 --> 01:01:31.669
useless in, in Diogenes's point of view, plateau was

1033
01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:33.570
uh uh was useless. And he says that he

1034
01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.800
said something like uh of what's used for us.

1035
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.889
He is a man who's been philosophy for uh

1036
01:01:37.899 --> 01:01:41.080
so long and has yet not upset uh anyone.

1037
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.199
So he was considering him as a kind of

1038
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.074
a lost cause someone was producing very high level

1039
01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:52.814
philosophical ideas, but that we are not grounded. So

1040
01:01:52.824 --> 01:01:56.425
that was the main critic. And about, you know,

1041
01:01:56.435 --> 01:01:58.864
the idea of the human being, the way a

1042
01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:02.145
plateau defined what is a human being. So, meaning

1043
01:02:02.155 --> 01:02:06.120
a biped uh with no leaves um with no

1044
01:02:06.129 --> 01:02:10.699
feathers, sorry with no feathers. Um And then uh

1045
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:14.370
uh Theogenes says the legend uh took a rooster

1046
01:02:14.379 --> 01:02:19.719
plucked, the, the rooster came to the um to

1047
01:02:19.729 --> 01:02:22.929
uh Plato's gymnasium and said this is Plato's human

1048
01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:26.159
being uh to, to, to make fun to the,

1049
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.389
this kind of philosophical corpus. So, uh Diogenes was

1050
01:02:32.399 --> 01:02:36.290
i, in that way, he was positioning himself against

1051
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.620
uh plateau's school that he considered as a kind

1052
01:02:39.629 --> 01:02:43.100
of very theoretical philosophy and not a philosophy in

1053
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:44.810
action. Mhm.

1054
01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.370
And uh do we know if Biogen wrote a

1055
01:02:49.379 --> 01:02:52.719
lot? Uh I mean, did he write at all?

1056
01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:56.610
Uh AS far as we know he did, he

1057
01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:01.469
did uh essays uh Economic Treaties Tragedies too. We

1058
01:03:01.479 --> 01:03:05.899
have two long lists of his opera. Uh They

1059
01:03:05.909 --> 01:03:09.590
are not exactly identical. There are reasons for that

1060
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.399
but maybe I won't go so far in the

1061
01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:15.199
conversation. But, but uh uh we have no reason

1062
01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:17.719
to doubt that he wrote. He wrote meaning that

1063
01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:20.489
he must have had some kind of material support,

1064
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.969
material help. Uh BECAUSE you need some scrolls, you

1065
01:03:23.979 --> 01:03:25.989
need, you need to have some material to write

1066
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.659
in ancient times like today, I could say. Uh

1067
01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:31.770
BUT yes, he, he wrote, he used writing to

1068
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.739
develop his ideas including tragedies again, Seattle. Uh But

1069
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:40.010
the thing is we, we lost everything basically apart

1070
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.489
from a, a big fragment of his uh um

1071
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.169
uh Political Philosophy Treaty uh polit that we, we,

1072
01:03:48.229 --> 01:03:50.570
we, we, we, which is, which has been saved

1073
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.489
by Philo Dema of Garra and quoted. But apart

1074
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.360
from that, we lost uh most of his text.

1075
01:03:56.370 --> 01:04:00.250
So we know his philosophy from uh his uh

1076
01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:04.449
Apotex. And for his um sayings, so the, the,

1077
01:04:04.459 --> 01:04:08.530
the big part of his philosophy, we, we grasp

1078
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.209
it, we get uh it's true uh anecdotes, uh

1079
01:04:13.219 --> 01:04:17.250
meetings, encounters and the dialogues he had with uh

1080
01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:22.159
some people. So some of these sayings are, must

1081
01:04:22.169 --> 01:04:25.280
have been close to the truth, other are very

1082
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.040
uh rebuilt by time and uh diff the different

1083
01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:33.790
philosophical schools that use them uh to defend cynicism

1084
01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.919
or to attack cynicism. So sometimes it's a bit

1085
01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:42.949
difficult to see through this uh uh very long

1086
01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:46.669
and complex transmission process to get to go back

1087
01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:48.739
to the like original diogenes

1088
01:04:49.649 --> 01:04:56.540
and which prominent philosophers uh mentioned having been influenced

1089
01:04:56.550 --> 01:05:00.399
by diogenes. And I'm not just asking about the

1090
01:05:00.409 --> 01:05:05.439
Greek and Roman philosophers, but basically across history.

1091
01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:10.360
Um And that's, that's, I'm not sure I am

1092
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:13.399
able to fully answer to the, to the question.

1093
01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:17.399
But I would, to, to my knowledge, the, the

1094
01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:20.280
um the philosopher who has been the, maybe the

1095
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:24.459
most influenced by uh diogenes. He will be Emil

1096
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.280
Cioran, the Romanian uh philosopher

1097
01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.419
from the 19th century.

1098
01:05:29.689 --> 01:05:32.159
Uh A bit uh a bit after that. He,

1099
01:05:32.169 --> 01:05:34.739
he died. Uh I don't remember exactly when he

1100
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.120
died. I don't know if he died end of

1101
01:05:36.129 --> 01:05:38.679
the 20th or beginning of the 21st. I'm sorry,

1102
01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:40.239
Emil C

1103
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:42.580
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know who you're talking

1104
01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:45.344
about. I, I just thought that he was born

1105
01:05:45.354 --> 01:05:48.054
in the 19th century but perhaps I'm

1106
01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:50.375
wrong, maybe no, I wouldn't say that. I don't

1107
01:05:50.385 --> 01:05:52.314
think so. I think he's born in the beginning

1108
01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:54.304
of the twenties. But you, you maybe, you know,

1109
01:05:54.314 --> 01:05:58.864
better. The so, so, so which was a Romanian

1110
01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:02.145
philosopher? But he lived in, not in exile. But

1111
01:06:02.415 --> 01:06:05.465
yes, he lived in gold books in Romanian. Then

1112
01:06:05.475 --> 01:06:08.540
it changed uh to uh to French on the

1113
01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:11.500
road the rest of his life. Uh IN um

1114
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.139
in French, he lived a very simple uh life

1115
01:06:15.149 --> 01:06:19.419
uh basically with no uh family, a very poor

1116
01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:23.939
life. He didn't work. Uh He wrote mainly uh

1117
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.739
a aorist sayings. So even the way he was

1118
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:31.169
communicating philosophy uh as some has something in common

1119
01:06:31.179 --> 01:06:35.179
with the way we know uh diogenes uh philosophy.

1120
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.500
It was very critical with basically uh everything in

1121
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:44.510
the social uh about social customs, social conventions. So,

1122
01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.750
um a very uh uh brutal uh way of

1123
01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.139
looking at uh humans and their behavior and society.

1124
01:06:54.209 --> 01:06:56.810
So, um I would say maybe uh the, the,

1125
01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.699
the, the, the, the biggest he uh of the

1126
01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:02.909
20th century will be em. Yes.

1127
01:07:03.239 --> 01:07:07.320
Mhm. And what about the influence that diogenes might

1128
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:11.489
have had on stoicism? The, did, did they have

1129
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.669
an influence there?

1130
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.959
Yes. Yes. Uh The first influence is uh genealogy.

1131
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:20.090
Uh The, you know, Socrates are uh antisthenes as

1132
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.040
a pupil, antitheism, a diogenes as a pupil uh

1133
01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:27.219
di direct or indirect pupil. We, we are not

1134
01:07:27.229 --> 01:07:31.520
sure that depending diogenes arrived in Athens before the

1135
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:35.179
death of antisthenes in 366 or after. We're not

1136
01:07:35.189 --> 01:07:39.570
sure. Diogenes at Ks as a pupil and CS

1137
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.899
as Z and Zeno is the founder of the

1138
01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:47.070
stoic school of South. Um So there is a

1139
01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.040
genealogical link. That's the first thing. The second thing

1140
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:53.110
is there is an ideological link. Yes. Uh Stoics

1141
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.570
in a way are like uh civilized cynics. If

1142
01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.399
you could say uh Cynics, you can be in

1143
01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:03.770
company with without being insulted. Um So the the

1144
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.969
level of the of provocation transgression uh exhortation to

1145
01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:12.469
is much uh lower. But there, there are some

1146
01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:15.489
common points. It's a, it's a stoic stoicism is

1147
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:20.620
an ethic philosophy as cynicism uh virtue. The search

1148
01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:25.589
for virtue is key in uh stoicism. And uh

1149
01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:28.399
there is this idea that you, you cannot be

1150
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:32.990
controlled by your feelings. Uh uh The cynics will

1151
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.169
say that you cannot be controlled by your needs.

1152
01:08:36.288 --> 01:08:38.508
Stoics will say that you cannot be controlled by

1153
01:08:38.519 --> 01:08:41.028
your feelings, meaning you cannot be controlled by your,

1154
01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:43.698
by your pain or by your pleasure, which is

1155
01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:47.179
a common point with uh uh Cynics. Uh There

1156
01:08:47.188 --> 01:08:50.108
is another strong common point is it is a

1157
01:08:50.118 --> 01:08:55.040
philosophy in action. Stoics uh consider that the way

1158
01:08:55.049 --> 01:08:58.569
you behave is key in a philosophical point of

1159
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:02.319
view. Again, it's not a theoretical philosophy. There is

1160
01:09:02.379 --> 01:09:07.700
a theoretical um corpus which is uh uh explaining

1161
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:11.839
uh analyzing the, the idea of virtue, the relationship

1162
01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:15.100
to Phoenix, et cetera. But what is most important

1163
01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:18.089
is the way you uh you behave. And maybe

1164
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.540
there is another element which is the relationship with

1165
01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:28.370
nature. For Stoics to understand the rules of nature

1166
01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.390
is key to uh choose your philosophical way of

1167
01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.290
life. You need to stay in contact with the

1168
01:09:36.299 --> 01:09:40.390
rules of uh nature. So, yes, there are, there

1169
01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:43.459
are lots of lots in common. But again, Stoics

1170
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:47.859
must have been much easier to um comp sti

1171
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.649
company must have been much easier and nicer than

1172
01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.370
Phoenix one,

1173
01:09:51.799 --> 01:09:54.129
right? And, and by the way, actually, I've asked

1174
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:59.120
you about stoicism specifically because we've seen in recent

1175
01:09:59.129 --> 01:10:04.915
years uh resurgence of spices in popular culture actually.

1176
01:10:04.924 --> 01:10:09.555
But uh do you look at these recent resurgence

1177
01:10:09.845 --> 01:10:14.475
uh as and as having anything to do with

1178
01:10:14.484 --> 01:10:16.024
the original sto

1179
01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.720
Yeah, I don't know if it's more stoicism or

1180
01:10:20.729 --> 01:10:24.229
more cynicism, the, the this uh the, the development

1181
01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.839
of the search of frugality, achy, um self sufficiency.

1182
01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.430
Um I, I think that some people will, will,

1183
01:10:32.439 --> 01:10:36.455
will uh claim to be influenced by the model.

1184
01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:39.834
Some will claim to be influenced by the stoic

1185
01:10:39.845 --> 01:10:42.754
uh model. I, I have never made a kind

1186
01:10:42.765 --> 01:10:45.404
of a full survey of the phenomenon. You're right.

1187
01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:49.805
I think it's an increasing trend movement across the

1188
01:10:49.814 --> 01:10:53.220
world of people who are trying to rethink our

1189
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:58.069
relationship to progress. And cynics and Stoics are of

1190
01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.890
can be of great help to uh to rethink

1191
01:11:00.899 --> 01:11:04.220
the relationship to, to progress the idea that we

1192
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:08.330
have to accumulate more and more to, to, to

1193
01:11:08.339 --> 01:11:12.350
produce uh more and more. Um SOME people are

1194
01:11:12.359 --> 01:11:16.299
trying to live a kind of decreasing uh life

1195
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:19.529
in that uh perspective. And, and diogenes is kind

1196
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.040
of uh the ultimate model of life in that

1197
01:11:23.049 --> 01:11:25.490
uh uh perspective. So, yes, there is a kind

1198
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:31.020
of uh um uh increasing popularity of this uh

1199
01:11:31.029 --> 01:11:35.899
ancient philosophic uh movement, ancient philosophies in actions uh

1200
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:38.580
that are more popular than they've been uh doing.

1201
01:11:38.589 --> 01:11:41.100
I would say a century ago, the popularity of

1202
01:11:41.109 --> 01:11:43.740
this movement was not the same in the, in

1203
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.009
the population, not in the academic world, but in

1204
01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.169
the uh normal world, I would

1205
01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:53.109
say. So, one last question, then how do you

1206
01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.319
look basically at the legacy of diogenes? I mean,

1207
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:02.859
how is he viewed today by philosophers in general

1208
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.259
and in popular culture?

1209
01:12:07.319 --> 01:12:13.140
Um I think there is still some time um

1210
01:12:13.819 --> 01:12:17.640
uh is still forgotten, sometimes it was forgotten sometime

1211
01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:22.000
in the ancient uh uh time in antiquity. Uh

1212
01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:25.029
Some histories of philosophy, I mean, in the ancient

1213
01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.450
times, uh uh forgot to uh to study uh

1214
01:12:29.459 --> 01:12:32.509
uh cynicism and it still happens sometimes you have

1215
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.890
some very large book about ancient philosophy. We don't

1216
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.080
uh even credit anything to uh cynicism. So uh

1217
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.220
that is a kind of very old uh tendency

1218
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:46.520
but uh things are, things are changing. Uh I

1219
01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.339
think in that, in that matter. So that is

1220
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:51.720
a kind of uh rehabilitation of the interest of

1221
01:12:51.729 --> 01:12:55.060
uh cynicism because of his genealogy with the Socratic

1222
01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:58.500
philosophy and the stoic uh philosophy that is a

1223
01:12:58.509 --> 01:13:01.879
kind of rehabilitation. Uh AND the, the fact that

1224
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:05.759
we are facing this very modern question of uh

1225
01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:09.160
and the way the world is uh going now

1226
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:12.729
and the economics, the industrial uh uh issues we

1227
01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.439
are, all of us are, are, are facing. Uh

1228
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:18.899
IT should, it should give to uh cynicism a

1229
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:22.060
kind of new uh uh new light on.

1230
01:13:23.009 --> 01:13:26.879
Mhm Great. So uh the book is again the

1231
01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:31.319
Dangerous Life and ideas of diogenes, the cynic. I'm

1232
01:13:31.330 --> 01:13:33.970
leaving a link to it in the description of

1233
01:13:33.979 --> 01:13:37.520
this interview. And uh J Manuel, just before we

1234
01:13:37.529 --> 01:13:39.839
go apart from the book, would you like to

1235
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:42.479
tell people where they can find you on the

1236
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:45.419
internet? Uh

1237
01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:47.879
What can you mean if I have some kind

1238
01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:48.100
of

1239
01:13:48.109 --> 01:13:53.970
internet? Yeah, like uh university page website, social media.

1240
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.160
I,

1241
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:57.220
I have no social media page of any kind.

1242
01:13:57.229 --> 01:14:00.850
I don't have any Facebook page, Instagram page, Twitter

1243
01:14:00.859 --> 01:14:03.910
page uh or youtube channel. Uh I just have

1244
01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:08.060
a professional page uh where my uh work is

1245
01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:12.279
uh uh referred. Uh So uh when I release

1246
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.770
a new uh a new study, a new book,

1247
01:14:15.779 --> 01:14:19.200
uh you, you can uh find it uh there.

1248
01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:22.100
Uh So that, that's it. Basically, I'm afraid I'm

1249
01:14:22.109 --> 01:14:25.100
not a, a very electronic uh

1250
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:29.140
person. Uh And do you have, for example, fuel

1251
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:33.379
uh uh few people profile or Research Gate or

1252
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:34.379
something like that.

1253
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:38.120
Um I, I'm sorry, I did not understand your

1254
01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:38.490

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:43.029
