00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.408
the Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.050
. And today I'm joined by Dr Nicholas Brown.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.750
He's a researcher at Linnaeus University in Sweden. He

5
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
works on developing new research methods in psychology and on

6
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.684
applying meta scientific perspectives on psychology as a. And

7
00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:24.635
today we're going to go through topics like conceptual and

8
00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.673
methodological issues in positive psychology and the study of well

9
00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:32.204
being. And then we're going to go through a

10
00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:37.673
few other studies, psychology related studies to talk about

11
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:42.009
examples of bad science. And then we're also going

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.829
to talk a little bit about where bad science stems

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.868
from and how we can deal with it. So

14
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:50.889
, Doctor Brown, welcome to the show. It's

15
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.020
a pleasure to everyone. Thank you for inviting me

16
00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:55.950
. It's always uh always interesting to talk about what

17
00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:00.469
I'm doing. OK. So let's start here with

18
00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:03.838
a positive psychology and the study of the determinants of

19
00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:07.480
well being. So, uh first of all,

20
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.629
tell us a little bit about how you got interested

21
00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:14.799
in this subject specifically and then we can get into

22
00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:18.510
some of the issues you found there. Well,

23
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:19.588
until 2009, I was a, I was a

24
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.469
computer guy and I was a manager in an IT

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.739
department. And then in what I like to call

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.859
a terrible administrative mix up, I got moved to

27
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.430
the HR department. Uh, and since my,

28
00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.549
my bachelor's in computer science had served me well for

29
00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.879
the previous 28 years in it, I thought that

30
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:36.778
maybe I should get some kind of, uh,

31
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.549
formal training in something to do with people, which

32
00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.138
was, you know, never II I like to

33
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.989
think I was a good pragmatic manager, but I

34
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.609
had no theory. And um due to a chance

35
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.540
encounter uh with Professor Richard, Professor Richard Wiseman,

36
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.838
who was a sort of fairly well known uh British

37
00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.058
uh psychologist Piers in the media. And, and

38
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.739
he mentioned, I I asked him whether there was

39
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.000
kind of any um science that could help with,

40
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.000
um particularly when you work in a large organization,

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.719
uh your, your human resources department sends you on

42
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.740
training courses to teach you to be a less bad

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.110
manager and things like that. And uh and it

44
00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:16.088
seemed to me this was my, in my new

45
00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.740
job buying, buying in those services was part of

46
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.058
my responsibility and it seemed to me that it was

47
00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.778
all a bit hand wavy. So I asked Professor

48
00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.258
Wiseman, you know, if there's any kind of

49
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.270
theory there? And he said, well, there

50
00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:30.520
is this sub sub. Now he could have mentioned

51
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.909
the good old fashioned, uh, organizational and,

52
00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.990
uh, and industrial io psychology. Or he could

53
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.058
have mentioned, you know, management schools, schools

54
00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:40.969
, but he mentioned this. He said his new

55
00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.439
field called Positive Psychology. They have a Masters at

56
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.349
the University of East London. And it's quite funny

57
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.379
because, like, I think a lot of people

58
00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.330
I have a recurring, or I had a recurring

59
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.699
nightmare, which is that it was three weeks until

60
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.069
my school leaving exams. But I had my present

61
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.778
knowledge, uh, of the subject matter. Um

62
00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:00.800
, and so I didn't imagine in a million years

63
00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:02.360
that I'd be going back to school. But there

64
00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:04.849
, I was at the age of 50 doing this

65
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.028
masters in something called applied positive psychology. And I

66
00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:10.058
had this very naive view of what psychology could teach

67
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.449
us about anything. So, in, in 2011

68
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.129
, yeah, I couldn't have named you three living

69
00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.778
psychologists. Uh, for example, uh, so

70
00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:20.379
I had a, you know, that was a

71
00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.659
quick, that was a fast introduction to psychology in

72
00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:24.659
general. I had no, absolutely no background,

73
00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.788
uh, positive psychology and, um, as,

74
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.199
as part of a, a taught master's program with

75
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.028
a little bit of a research project tacked onto the

76
00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:35.618
end of it. But, um, that was

77
00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.179
how I, I got into that. Um,

78
00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.949
and about halfway through it was a two year masters

79
00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:45.099
, the opportunity came up to take early retirement.

80
00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:49.490
So I left paid employment in the end of June

81
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.979
2012 and decided to see what would turn up in

82
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.169
terms of things to interest me. And since then

83
00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.889
I finished the masters, uh I spent a year

84
00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.899
in a psychotherapy school where I learned that I would

85
00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.659
be AAA pretty poor psychotherapist. And um then I

86
00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.360
got a, I got a chance to be on

87
00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.250
a phd program uh using some of the critical stuff

88
00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:16.129
that I was writing about positive psychology and then psychology

89
00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.269
in general. And more recently, my work has

90
00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:23.980
gone into um bad science and up to and including

91
00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:29.189
fraudulent science and in psychology and areas beyond. Um

92
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.298
but the, the kinds of analyses I do are

93
00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:36.040
more suited to uh social science type uh situations.

94
00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:39.838
Although I also do work on that in things like

95
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.819
biomedical, some biomedical fields. So there's the whole

96
00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:46.600
, the whole spectrum of the science reform movement from

97
00:04:46.608 --> 00:04:48.959
doing things a bit better up to doing less fraud

98
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.500
is, is roughly where I am today. But

99
00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.600
I, I, yeah, I, I started

100
00:04:53.608 --> 00:04:59.660
off critiquing uh positive psychology both kind of somewhat theoretically

101
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.059
although, you know, I don't have the psychological

102
00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.108
background to really, you know, heavily critique every

103
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.819
single construct in terms of the history of the literature

104
00:05:08.028 --> 00:05:10.079
. Um and, and, and also pragmatically and

105
00:05:10.088 --> 00:05:13.379
, and experimental. OK. But uh tell us

106
00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.588
a bit about that. What were some of the

107
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.939
main conceptual and methodological issues you, you found in

108
00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.949
positive psychology and the study of well being? Well

109
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.899
, what I found coming from the outside was uh

110
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.139
and I mean, maybe this is a criticism of

111
00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:33.338
just how psychology works in general. But I,

112
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.459
I know there are people within psychology who talk about

113
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.579
this is what are we measuring? And how are

114
00:05:39.588 --> 00:05:42.220
we saying that things are better or, or,

115
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.059
or, or what is well being? How do

116
00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.699
you measure well-being? And it seems to me you

117
00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:49.009
can get psychologists to agree among themselves occasionally that something

118
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:51.470
is a measure of well-being. But whether or not

119
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.819
that actually relates to what ordinary individuals would talk about

120
00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:57.619
, I don't know. One of the criticisms I

121
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.100
have, for example, is a lot of positive

122
00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.160
psychology research uh will say that an intervention made people

123
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.959
happier. And what they will do is they will

124
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.838
count uh an improvement in scores on the BD I

125
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.059
two, the beck depression inventory, which is kind

126
00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.480
of the, the gold standard test. But if

127
00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:16.309
you go to a doctor and say, I think

128
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.278
I am depressed, they may give you this.

129
00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.528
Um So the BD I is 21 items and each

130
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.509
of them is scored 0 to 3. And the

131
00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.519
idea is that uh uh we can say normal,

132
00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:32.649
we're allowed to say no normal person and a healthy

133
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.329
person will typically respond zero to almost all of them

134
00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:39.889
. Because if you actually read the questions, even

135
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.160
, even level one, even a level one answer

136
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.939
is like, wow, that's, that's somebody you

137
00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.889
might say is quite often, quite sad, et

138
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.189
cetera. Um And a typical score out of 63

139
00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.170
possible on this in a normal healthy population is about

140
00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:56.059
three or four. So there are about three items

141
00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.149
out of 21 that a normal person might endorse.

142
00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:03.230
Um and a a at the first level. And

143
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.730
in order to qualify for a diagnosis of mild depression

144
00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.730
, you have to score 14. Um which,

145
00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:14.189
and if you read it, if you read the

146
00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.238
BD I, and, and if you yourself have

147
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.559
no experience of mental illness or depression, uh and

148
00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.480
you think, you know, if I was endorsing

149
00:07:20.488 --> 00:07:23.790
14 of those, most people, I think who

150
00:07:23.798 --> 00:07:26.879
have no experience of men would go God, if

151
00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.939
I was endorsing 14 of those, I'd, I'd

152
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.730
feel pretty bad. You have to get to 14

153
00:07:30.738 --> 00:07:33.329
to be mild depression, then there's moderate and then

154
00:07:33.338 --> 00:07:38.850
there's severe with even higher scores. Now, quite

155
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:41.738
a lot of positive psychology studies will go out and

156
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.528
, and recruit people. And the whole point of

157
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.000
positive psychology is, it's the psychology of people who

158
00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:48.399
are not depressed and who just want to sort of

159
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.009
do a bit better in life and they will measure

160
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:54.149
their BD I scores and they'll get a mean of

161
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.850
4.2 and then they'll do this whatever psychology, positive

162
00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:00.850
psychology intervention and the, the mean will be 3.8

163
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.209
. But I don't know what, what is the

164
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.000
difference between 4.2 and 3.8 when to even be mildly

165
00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:11.088
depressed, you have to be 40. Why are

166
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.689
we measuring at this, you know, ridiculously low

167
00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:16.730
end where, you know, nobody is in any

168
00:08:16.738 --> 00:08:20.149
sense depressed. And we're saying, well, they're

169
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.149
, they weren't depressed before and now they are very

170
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.949
slightly more not depressed. I don't think that that

171
00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.829
necessarily constitutes a good measure of whether people are uh

172
00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:35.200
experiencing well-being and something I learned as I went along

173
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.570
, particularly on my master's course. But, but

174
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.609
other uh talking to other people is that a lot

175
00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:43.029
of people who are studying positive psychology are actually quite

176
00:08:43.038 --> 00:08:46.739
depressed, but they are, it seems to me

177
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.710
and this is, this is an opinion and a

178
00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:50.889
judgment, a lot of people who are attracted to

179
00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:54.158
positive psychology are kind of in denial about being depressed

180
00:08:54.808 --> 00:08:56.609
and think that if they could just be a bit

181
00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.298
happier, whatever that would mean that they would be

182
00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:01.590
no longer depressed. So then the question is,

183
00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:05.940
is depression the opposite of happiness. And psychologists have

184
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.619
been arguing about that for years, are positive emotions

185
00:09:09.788 --> 00:09:16.139
qualitatively different from negative emotions or are they just uh

186
00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:18.479
you know, plus and minus versions of the same

187
00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:22.820
thing and emotions researchers don't agree about that. So

188
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.038
it, it seemed to me that a lot of

189
00:09:24.048 --> 00:09:28.369
it was um it was ostensibly aimed at making people

190
00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.139
who were not depressed happier, but a lot of

191
00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:31.739
the people who want to. Oh, I really

192
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.129
, it would be so much, the world would

193
00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.989
be so much better if people were a bit happier

194
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.979
, were really, to some extent talking about either

195
00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:39.538
themselves or their, their depressed friends or, or

196
00:09:39.548 --> 00:09:43.139
whatever, because a lot of people get into psychology

197
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.849
, either to understand their own problems or the problems

198
00:09:45.859 --> 00:09:48.178
of the people immediately around them. Um, and

199
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.500
then the other side of it was, if it

200
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.379
wasn't about that, the problem was, it was

201
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:58.048
very kind of, it seemed very suburban and middle

202
00:09:58.058 --> 00:10:01.080
class American. Uh, it seemed like it was

203
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:07.928
an ideal vehicle for selling you books for 2499 and

204
00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:11.729
improve your well-being courses for 4 99 99 for 10

205
00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:13.288
episodes. You know, and you can keep the

206
00:10:13.298 --> 00:10:16.279
podcast, you can keep the MP3 file for a

207
00:10:16.288 --> 00:10:18.509
week, that kind of thing that it, it

208
00:10:18.548 --> 00:10:20.489
, it was very, very easy to be skeptical

209
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.298
about it or to be cynical about it in terms

210
00:10:22.308 --> 00:10:24.609
of somebody's making quite a lot of money out of

211
00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:30.080
it. Mhm. And I kind of have this

212
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.719
naive view of science that science ought to be kind

213
00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:35.668
of free. Mm. Um, II, I

214
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:39.649
, I'm not against capitalism or industry or anything like

215
00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:45.548
that but basic, a scientific finding should be,

216
00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:46.590
uh, you know, if you, if you've

217
00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:50.009
discovered a truth about the universe, I don't think

218
00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:50.950
that's really something you should be able to kind of

219
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.469
patent and license and make money on and, and

220
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:56.298
, I mean, this is a problem throughout psychology

221
00:10:56.308 --> 00:10:58.869
is that, uh, a lot of the measures

222
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.619
, I don't know, I don't know if the

223
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:03.000
BD I is one of them, but a lot

224
00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:05.668
of the clinical measures you have to pay, you

225
00:11:05.678 --> 00:11:11.219
have to pay some psychologist 20 bucks to administer this

226
00:11:11.229 --> 00:11:13.989
scale to a patient. And it's like, well

227
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.259
, it's, is it a pharmaceutical thing? Have

228
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:20.849
you manufactured anything? Just, I, I don't

229
00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:22.119
know, uh, who paid for the research that

230
00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:26.460
discovered it? You know, if the NIH funded

231
00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:28.500
it and you discovered it and now you're selling the

232
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:30.239
result for 20 bucks, how much of that is

233
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.558
going back to the NIH? So, I don't

234
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.279
know, I think there are, I, I

235
00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:35.408
just found that there were all kinds of, of

236
00:11:35.418 --> 00:11:37.710
, of those kind of issues which everybody in psychology

237
00:11:37.719 --> 00:11:39.580
seemed to think was completely normal. So maybe,

238
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.038
you know, maybe I was wrong but I had

239
00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:45.509
the impression that this was, this wasn't how I

240
00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:50.719
thought science was done. Mhm. And I guess

241
00:11:50.729 --> 00:11:52.779
we'll come back to some of these issues later on

242
00:11:52.788 --> 00:11:56.080
. When, toward the end of our interview,

243
00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.509
we'll talk about bad science and what I guess motivates

244
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.639
it, et cetera. But uh I would like

245
00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:07.389
to ask you now about a piece of work that

246
00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:11.200
you yourself critiqued coming from. Uh I hope I'm

247
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:15.048
pronouncing the name correctly. Leu Bomi at all.

248
00:12:15.058 --> 00:12:18.288
I mean, their a happiness pie. Well,

249
00:12:18.298 --> 00:12:20.500
I mean, what is, what were they really

250
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:24.820
working on? There, what is these or what

251
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.879
was this happiness pay really about? And what would

252
00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:31.379
you say were the issues with it? Well,

253
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:33.239
the way I read it now is that in the

254
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.129
early days of the Positive Psychology movement, which was

255
00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:39.359
kind of launched with a bang by a bunch of

256
00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:41.288
psychologists saying, you know, we're mad as hell

257
00:12:41.298 --> 00:12:41.840
and we're not gonna take it anymore. We want

258
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:45.038
people to be happier. We're not just going to

259
00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:48.269
be about, you know, depression. And um

260
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.899
it's, it was kind of a pa it was

261
00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:54.830
a paper that kind of positioned the idea that people

262
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.259
have a substantial amount of control over their levels of

263
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:05.960
happiness based on what they choose to do. And

264
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.399
so it took a very, it made it,

265
00:13:09.408 --> 00:13:13.298
it, it took what we know about the,

266
00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:18.529
the extent to which your t trait happiness is genetically

267
00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:22.658
determined. Uh And when we say genetically, not

268
00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.158
just, you know, genes and your uh uh

269
00:13:24.168 --> 00:13:30.548
interaction with the environment and they sort of said it

270
00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:33.529
, that's about 50%. Now, it's probably a

271
00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:37.210
bit higher than 50% but that wasn't really the big

272
00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.349
issue. And then they said, and your life

273
00:13:39.359 --> 00:13:43.149
circumstances only account for about 10% of your happens.

274
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.869
Uh And they added the 50 the 10 got to

275
00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:52.109
60 subtracted that 60% from one and said, therefore

276
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.580
, 40% of your happiness uh is um you know

277
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.428
, you can change, you can make a difference

278
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.308
to your happiness. And this is conceptually not very

279
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.418
good. Uh First of all, these are all

280
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.700
population level things. They don't tell us anything about

281
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.928
individuals. But by far, the biggest problem was

282
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.200
it is absurd to say that people's happiness is only

283
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:20.678
influenced to 10% of the variance in happiness will be

284
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.418
explained by life circumstances. Uh If you look at

285
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:26.308
um you know, the, the, the countries

286
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.210
that are the happiest in the world on that one

287
00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:30.369
item, how happy are you survey that comes out

288
00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:35.090
every year? Denmark scores 7.9. Syria scores 2.4

289
00:14:37.538 --> 00:14:41.629
. Um It does that mean. Yeah, so

290
00:14:41.719 --> 00:14:45.408
one of them is now, how should we just

291
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.408
say one's one's multiplied by three to get the other

292
00:14:48.418 --> 00:14:50.038
? Let's do that. Let's naively say that people

293
00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:54.048
in Denmark are three times happier than people in Syria

294
00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:58.460
. Um Is that because the people in Syria are

295
00:14:58.469 --> 00:15:03.019
not, you know, listening to the right kind

296
00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:03.969
of music that they really like or, you know

297
00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:07.320
, they, you know, they just need to

298
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.080
kind of get some kind of lifestyle makeover. Is

299
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.099
there maybe something else about living in Syria about the

300
00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:16.359
circumstances of living in Syria uh that make people less

301
00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:18.719
happy? Uh And, and you can even,

302
00:15:18.729 --> 00:15:20.788
you could look at this, for example, with

303
00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:24.649
Greece, where Greece went from scoring like 5.9 I

304
00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:26.080
don't know the numbers off the top of my head

305
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.229
, but basically between 2005, 2014, the whole

306
00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:33.830
Greek financial crisis, the Greek scores went from about

307
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.259
5.9 or something to about 4.2. So Greeks became

308
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:41.219
40% less happy. Now, was that because they

309
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.399
stopped going to the gym or did something else happen

310
00:15:45.408 --> 00:15:46.178
in Greece? That? And so it turned out

311
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.119
that circumstances have an enormous effect. And so I

312
00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:52.889
went and dug into what was the source for this

313
00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:56.609
claim. And it turned out to be um some

314
00:15:56.619 --> 00:16:00.200
studies of Americans. First of all, everybody in

315
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.700
the survey was Americans. So the circumstances that they

316
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.048
were looking at could only have been circumstances that are

317
00:16:07.058 --> 00:16:10.759
common to Americans. So there was no, there

318
00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:11.359
was nothing in there about, have you got clean

319
00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:14.298
drinking water? Uh Do you live in a,

320
00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.460
you know, in a democracy because everyone had that

321
00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:18.739
in common. But secondly, also if you actually

322
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.519
looked what they call um life circumstances, there were

323
00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:26.619
just half a dozen demographic variables. They didn't in

324
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:30.519
the studies that they were quoting the what they was

325
00:16:30.529 --> 00:16:33.489
not a full investigation of people's life circumstances. So

326
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.389
basically, it was a hand waving reference to research

327
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.808
that didn't show what they said it showed. And

328
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.019
the net result was, they said only 10% is

329
00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:45.859
due to circumstances. Therefore, the other 40% is

330
00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:51.509
available for you as an individual um to, to

331
00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:55.219
alter. In addition, while the paper itself had

332
00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:59.070
one or two hedges about about this and, and

333
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.729
not enough, it certainly didn't combine the variant in

334
00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:03.380
an appropriate way. But nonetheless, it kind of

335
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.299
acknowledged that these, he um Lubomirski then wrote two

336
00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:11.650
books, uh particularly the first one, which was

337
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.640
the How of Happiness, which had a picture of

338
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.170
this happiness pie. So the pie was the pie

339
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.009
chart. 50% gene genetic, 10% circumstances, 40%

340
00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:23.618
you can improve your happiness. Um And you know

341
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.059
, she actually wrote things like that. 40% is

342
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:30.039
yours to guide. You know, you, you

343
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.949
the reader, you, the individual reader forget the

344
00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:34.789
fact that our study even had it been done correctly

345
00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:37.618
, would have been talking about a decomposition of population

346
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.509
level variants in the popular book which, you know

347
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:45.348
, is signed off on by Doctor Levski and nobody

348
00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:47.989
else, it says this is yours to guide and

349
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.529
that is simply deceptive, that is simply deceptive because

350
00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:52.779
the, the paper itself, even if the paper

351
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:56.219
were absolutely true. And I mean, this is

352
00:17:56.229 --> 00:17:57.559
another problem we have with popular science where we,

353
00:17:57.568 --> 00:18:00.410
we publish one study and that then becomes the total

354
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.269
truth that we can build huge narratives around in a

355
00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:06.739
, in a what I call glad well, organization

356
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.989
process. But even if that were the case,

357
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.299
that isn't even what the paper said. Mhm.

358
00:18:12.439 --> 00:18:14.799
And, and, and, and so that,

359
00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:17.318
that, that, that, that paper is part

360
00:18:17.328 --> 00:18:21.160
of, um I think we're obliged to think of

361
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.209
words that, that remind you of the phrase military

362
00:18:22.219 --> 00:18:23.799
industrial complex. So, I don't know if we

363
00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:27.959
say psychological marketing comp um complex, but it's part

364
00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:33.699
of the uh the airport book world in which a

365
00:18:33.709 --> 00:18:37.000
top scientist from a top university shows you how you

366
00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:41.239
can hack your life with real science. Tm.

367
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.739
And then when you go and look at the real

368
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.500
science. Tm. Um, it's somewhere between,

369
00:18:48.818 --> 00:18:52.078
uh misrepresented, wasn't very good in the first place

370
00:18:52.088 --> 00:18:55.368
or outright fraudulent in a great many of the cases

371
00:18:55.858 --> 00:19:00.969
. Mhm. A and something that you reference there

372
00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:06.890
was this sort of global happiness surveys that we get

373
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.348
from time to time. I mean, how much

374
00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:15.660
useful information do you think we can really get from

375
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.338
them in terms of actually uh trying to understand if

376
00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:23.949
people in a particular country and then comparing across different

377
00:19:23.959 --> 00:19:30.588
countries are really happier or sad. It's difficult because

378
00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:32.130
so this is, we're talking about a thing called

379
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.588
the World Happiness Survey that there are others. But

380
00:19:33.598 --> 00:19:36.750
the, the big one is the World Happiness survey

381
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.140
. And basically it's, it's done once a year

382
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.430
and they go and ask people a one item question

383
00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:44.348
and it's uh on, on a, on a

384
00:19:44.358 --> 00:19:45.848
ladder where zero is the worst life possible. And

385
00:19:45.858 --> 00:19:48.390
10 is the absolutely ideal life you could lead.

386
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.809
Where are you? So it's actually about life satisfaction

387
00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:56.979
. But life satisfaction versus happiness for the purposes of

388
00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:57.578
this conversation, I think we can treat it as

389
00:19:57.588 --> 00:20:02.160
the same. And what happens is um well,

390
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.509
there are several narratives that get repeated every year.

391
00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:07.979
One of them is that the Scandinavian countries are happiest

392
00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:11.229
in the world and they usually are usually uh Norway

393
00:20:11.239 --> 00:20:12.959
, Denmark, Sweden and Finland will. Uh Finland

394
00:20:12.969 --> 00:20:15.029
is not a Scandinavian country. Please don't write in

395
00:20:15.243 --> 00:20:18.515
listeners um will come out in the top four of

396
00:20:18.525 --> 00:20:19.733
the top five and everyone will say, oh,

397
00:20:19.743 --> 00:20:22.354
these co well, you could argue they're kind of

398
00:20:22.364 --> 00:20:26.775
one country, they're all fairly homogeneous culturally. Again

399
00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:27.564
, please don't write in. But, you know

400
00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:32.265
, uh and so if, if tomorrow Norway,

401
00:20:32.275 --> 00:20:33.164
Sweden, Denmark and Finland got together and said,

402
00:20:33.174 --> 00:20:36.654
we are going to form the Nordic Union, you

403
00:20:36.664 --> 00:20:38.295
know, maybe including Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

404
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:41.809
Um uh We could, they would be one country

405
00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:44.449
and all of a sudden three others would move into

406
00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:45.009
the top 10 cos one of the problems with the

407
00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:48.229
top 10 countries is that countries are a pretty arbitrary

408
00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:52.000
way of defining the world. You know, you

409
00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:53.848
might find that the Marshall Islands, you know,

410
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.910
ev if everyone in the Marshall Islands, sort of

411
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.439
, you know, that if they only interview 50

412
00:20:57.449 --> 00:20:59.910
people and they all say nine, go, oh

413
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.809
my God. The Marshall Islands are the happiest country

414
00:21:00.818 --> 00:21:03.078
. Let's all rush to the Marshall Islands and find

415
00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:06.670
out what they're doing. You see this with education

416
00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:08.759
uh a few years ago, uh um Sweden was

417
00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:11.709
top of most of the education leagues and everyone had

418
00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:11.799
to go and say, oh, what are we

419
00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:14.479
? We should copy the Swedish model and the New

420
00:21:14.489 --> 00:21:15.529
York Times and all those papers would have a thing

421
00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:18.390
to say. Here's what daily life looks like in

422
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.118
a Swedish school and, you know, compare that

423
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.479
with the US. And then one year Finland came

424
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:25.400
top. Finland got like half of, half of

425
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.170
, yeah. 0.01 ahead of Sweden. Uh oh

426
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.709
my God. What are the Fins? And it

427
00:21:29.719 --> 00:21:32.709
turns out Finland and Sweden have very different education systems

428
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.539
. But now we all have to sort of say

429
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:34.848
, oh, we, and we've gone to,

430
00:21:34.858 --> 00:21:37.769
you know, various journalists, got a, you

431
00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:41.489
know, uh um flights to Lapland round about Christmas

432
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.568
with their kids, interviewed a few school teachers.

433
00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:45.400
Yeah, there's, and the Finnish model in Swedish

434
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.809
were both completely different, but they were both in

435
00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:51.039
all. So there is this element and any time

436
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:53.848
you see a top 10 list of countries, it's

437
00:21:53.858 --> 00:21:59.479
immediately meaningless because there's nothing wrong with being the fifth

438
00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:03.068
best country out of 100 and 93 un member countries

439
00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:06.618
. You're probably doing pretty well. Mhm. You're

440
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:07.880
probably doing pretty well. So one of the narratives

441
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.328
is that Finland is fantastic. Therefore, we should

442
00:22:11.338 --> 00:22:14.068
all embrace social democracy. Capitalism is bad. The

443
00:22:14.078 --> 00:22:18.219
US and the UK are generally about 13th or 14th

444
00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:19.699
. But because we decided to look at the top

445
00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:23.019
10 and Australia's usually in there as well. Australia

446
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:25.979
is, you know, this is capitalist a country

447
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:26.299
as, as the US or, or, or

448
00:22:26.309 --> 00:22:29.500
the UK. So there, it, it basically

449
00:22:29.509 --> 00:22:32.900
enables people to tell stories. Then you can say

450
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.699
, oh, last year the US was 13th,

451
00:22:33.709 --> 00:22:37.019
this year it's 16th. That must be due to

452
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:38.979
Trump or that must be due to Biden or that

453
00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:41.299
must. Nah, it's just, just, just

454
00:22:41.309 --> 00:22:44.920
sampling error. These countries are all, people are

455
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:49.150
all going 7.97 0.8327 0.841. You know, th

456
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.229
this, this doesn't mean that something radical happened now

457
00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:55.818
. Yes, if your country goes from 6 to

458
00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:57.449
4, like what happened to Greece, you might

459
00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.118
go. Hm. There's a problem, but we

460
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.049
didn't need the World Happiness Survey to tell us that

461
00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:04.779
there was a problem in Greece. So it didn't

462
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:07.739
add anything. We would have been amazed if it

463
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.239
hadn't, if they hadn't got less happy. If

464
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.209
, if, if Greece had had the same numbers

465
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.680
in 2014 as 2005, we would have gone.

466
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.309
They're pretty resilient people. Their country's been completely buffered

467
00:23:18.318 --> 00:23:22.430
about unemployment, went up to whatever it did.

468
00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:25.910
You know, the ATM S weren't working. So

469
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:27.068
that's the, the, the first problem is if

470
00:23:27.078 --> 00:23:30.769
it, if any change, any small change is

471
00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:32.680
likely to be noise and any big change, you're

472
00:23:32.689 --> 00:23:34.618
gonna already know about anyone. The other problem is

473
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.689
it doesn't take into account the fact that culturally,

474
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.160
well, how you answer a question on the scale

475
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.088
of 0 to 10 is going to be quite different

476
00:23:45.098 --> 00:23:48.130
. Um, if I can be a stereotypical brit

477
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.709
for a moment, it's quite hard. At least

478
00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:56.809
the, the view that people have of the Brits

479
00:23:56.279 --> 00:24:03.000
is they're not likely to say 10. Um,

480
00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:03.588
there is this, you know, and again,

481
00:24:03.598 --> 00:24:07.009
this, this may be a stereotyping. I am

482
00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:08.368
a brit. So it's not racist but, you

483
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.568
know, this could be a thing. Oh,

484
00:24:10.578 --> 00:24:12.380
yeah, they're quite money. And whereas one might

485
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:17.189
imagine that the American, yeah. USA number 110

486
00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:19.578
, I'm 10. And you can invent all kinds

487
00:24:19.588 --> 00:24:22.828
of stories around that about why people might say 10

488
00:24:22.838 --> 00:24:26.108
and, and what their culture has to say about

489
00:24:26.118 --> 00:24:27.539
when you're interviewed in the street by somebody and you

490
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:30.868
don't know them and et cetera, uh you can

491
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.799
imagine that in some nondemocratic countries that perhaps people are

492
00:24:34.939 --> 00:24:37.578
, um, might be less happy than they say

493
00:24:37.588 --> 00:24:41.509
they are. But want to know, you know

494
00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:41.779
, it's like, oh, ok, who's,

495
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:44.880
who's asking? Oh, you're not from the government

496
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:45.779
. Well, that's what someone from the government would

497
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:48.269
say. I'm 10. I'm very happy with our

498
00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.449
comrade leader. So, you know, all of

499
00:24:52.459 --> 00:24:56.689
those things now that you can kind of compare year

500
00:24:56.699 --> 00:24:56.848
on year, I guess. But as I say

501
00:24:56.858 --> 00:24:59.650
, the small changes are gonna be noise and the

502
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.009
big changes you're probably gonna predict to them anyway.

503
00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:06.920
So essentially it's a way of it provides fodder for

504
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.529
filling column inches uh in newspapers and that may not

505
00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:14.559
have been the intention. And maybe there is some

506
00:25:14.568 --> 00:25:15.759
serious social science that can go on behind that.

507
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:21.930
But by and large it, it's like university rankings

508
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.479
if you, uh if you sort of, uh

509
00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:26.759
even big countries tend, I don't know whether Portugal

510
00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:26.848
does it, but big countries, you have a

511
00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:29.890
thing, like what are the best universities and what

512
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.390
will happen is um they rank you on about 25

513
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.539
considerations. And so even if you are the 84th

514
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:42.239
best university overall, on some measure that we don't

515
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.459
know. But let's, you know, uh,

516
00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:47.219
Paul Meal, the great psychologist talked about someone called

517
00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:51.259
omniscient Jones who knew the actual value of the parameter

518
00:25:51.328 --> 00:25:52.318
. Uh, and, uh, let's say your

519
00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:56.068
university is actually the 84th best out of 100 in

520
00:25:56.078 --> 00:25:59.150
the country. It's probably going to be in the

521
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.939
top 10 on one of those measures. And so

522
00:26:02.949 --> 00:26:04.199
you could put, you know, university of wherever

523
00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:07.279
we're in the top 10 on, um, student

524
00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:11.469
experience brackets, outdoor sports or something like that.

525
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.078
And if you aren't in the top 10, you

526
00:26:15.088 --> 00:26:18.420
will have gone, you will have improved 25 places

527
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.219
on one of these measures and you go, the

528
00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:23.838
results are out, we improve 25 places on student

529
00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:29.390
experience, indoor sports. Congratulations. Every, everybody

530
00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:30.430
and, you know, all have won and all

531
00:26:30.439 --> 00:26:33.259
must have prizes. But guess what? People are

532
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:37.910
still applying to Oxford and Cambridge. Yeah. No

533
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.229
, you know, that this is also funny because

534
00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:45.650
uh uh it came to mind that uh also sort

535
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.959
of loosely related to this happiness surveys. Then of

536
00:26:49.969 --> 00:26:53.670
course, you can also market and sell those books

537
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:59.338
where people find uh culture, uh uh some sort

538
00:26:59.348 --> 00:27:03.275
of culturally contained, let's say a concepts surrounding the

539
00:27:03.664 --> 00:27:07.025
lifestyle and happiness. Like for example, in Japan

540
00:27:07.035 --> 00:27:11.785
, the Iki guy and in Denmark hike or,

541
00:27:11.795 --> 00:27:15.064
or h or however you pronounce it and, and

542
00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:15.834
then, oh my God, you just have to

543
00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:19.625
do this and you will be happy forever. And

544
00:27:19.634 --> 00:27:22.703
then, and so you spend two years buying all

545
00:27:22.713 --> 00:27:23.805
the ike guy stuff and then that doesn't work.

546
00:27:23.814 --> 00:27:26.354
So then you go and buy all the hugger shit

547
00:27:26.364 --> 00:27:27.213
and then you buy whatever the Swedish stuff is and

548
00:27:27.223 --> 00:27:30.344
you've got this house full of crap. Um Yeah

549
00:27:30.354 --> 00:27:33.500
, I mean, the point is that a lot

550
00:27:33.509 --> 00:27:37.578
of people have outsourced their thinking about their happiness to

551
00:27:37.588 --> 00:27:42.410
experts and while that's a sensible thing to do on

552
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.338
things like, um you know, cancer and blood

553
00:27:45.348 --> 00:27:52.848
pressure, um I, I would argue personally and

554
00:27:52.858 --> 00:27:53.809
II, I never thought about this until I got

555
00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:57.199
into psychology. But I mean, why do we

556
00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:02.430
even, why do we have psychiatrists? Why,

557
00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:06.140
you know, why do we have psychiatrists for many

558
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.650
conditions that are really just about being human? You

559
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.160
know, obviously, if you have some kind of

560
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.009
neurological disorder, uh if, and, and you

561
00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:17.759
know, I'm sure things like schizophrenia and things like

562
00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:21.838
that have some kind of biological basis. But uh

563
00:28:21.848 --> 00:28:23.969
we've, we started off with that and then we

564
00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:27.900
kind of ended up medicalising everything and, and it

565
00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.939
, which is ironic, cos um positive psychology likes

566
00:28:30.949 --> 00:28:33.939
to think that it's not about the medicalization of everything

567
00:28:33.949 --> 00:28:38.289
. But uh though II I um bit of a

568
00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:41.269
plug, but it won't sell many copies. I

569
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:45.059
edited a book on which we call critical positive psychology

570
00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:47.170
. And there was an excellent chapter in there saying

571
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.469
, well, positive psychology claims to reject the medical

572
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:52.588
model, but look what they're doing. And in

573
00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:53.769
fact, you know, part of the medical model

574
00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:56.189
is I am an expert. You're not. If

575
00:28:56.199 --> 00:28:59.160
you give me some money, I will treat you

576
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.578
. And again, I don't have a problem with

577
00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:02.709
that with the person who, you know, fixes

578
00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:04.989
my cardiac arrhythmia. But uh so I think a

579
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.348
lot of people imagine that they must, they don't

580
00:29:08.358 --> 00:29:11.630
, they know that they don't know very much,

581
00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.779
you know, nobody knows very much about it.

582
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:17.608
Even the kind of philosophers of happiness over the years

583
00:29:17.618 --> 00:29:19.680
acknowledged they didn't really know much about it. But

584
00:29:19.689 --> 00:29:22.789
we imagine that there must be experts that we can

585
00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:26.449
, if we can just give them some money,

586
00:29:26.459 --> 00:29:29.279
then they will fix that problem in the same way

587
00:29:29.289 --> 00:29:32.549
that they fixed our ingrowing toenail. And um so

588
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.019
there is this huge market for that and, and

589
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:37.489
it, it's interesting when Positive psychology was launched,

590
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.930
it was very much um it was with an attack

591
00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:42.689
on the people at the, the softer end of

592
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:47.068
psychology, the, the humanistic psychologists because, and

593
00:29:47.078 --> 00:29:48.920
it blamed them for the fact that the all the

594
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.489
self help books are about, you know, the

595
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.838
secret and your inner child and, you know,

596
00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:56.318
assorted bullshit. Uh And, but there was an

597
00:29:56.328 --> 00:30:00.650
element of jealousy there in that, uh those books

598
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.660
sell and make a lot of money and, and

599
00:30:03.858 --> 00:30:07.229
most of the leading positive psychologists have one or two

600
00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:11.459
New York Times best selling books based on their research

601
00:30:11.469 --> 00:30:15.439
and the research of their fellow uh positive psychologists.

602
00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:17.358
And the research isn't always all that great. And

603
00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:18.068
then at that point, how much of a difference

604
00:30:18.078 --> 00:30:22.400
is there? Um particularly because, and I think

605
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.848
this is a studying also in, in, in

606
00:30:23.858 --> 00:30:29.130
psycho a wider psychology. There's a certain kind of

607
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.368
psychologist that you meet. When you go to a

608
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.689
psychology faculty, there are the ones who are absolutely

609
00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:38.078
interested in, in measuring this and cognitive performance and

610
00:30:38.088 --> 00:30:41.818
, and, and the determinants of depression. And

611
00:30:41.828 --> 00:30:45.299
then there are others who've basically got a theory that

612
00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:49.420
they want the world to listen to and they're in

613
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.150
order for the world to listen to them. OK

614
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.039
, I've gotta go and dig up some data,

615
00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:56.209
but they're, they're not kind of going into the

616
00:30:56.219 --> 00:31:00.519
lab every morning in full Richard Feynman mode trying to

617
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:03.818
, trying to disprove their theory. Um These people

618
00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:07.338
tend to be quite charismatic, they tend to do

619
00:31:07.348 --> 00:31:11.640
good presentations. Um, and they're clearly on some

620
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:17.449
kind of mission, excuse me. And now if

621
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:18.848
sometimes that gets attacked as, you know, some

622
00:31:18.858 --> 00:31:22.969
sort of lefty socialist mission or occasionally, you know

623
00:31:22.979 --> 00:31:25.568
, even some right wing mission on intelligence and things

624
00:31:25.578 --> 00:31:26.598
like that. But in general, it's not really

625
00:31:26.608 --> 00:31:29.789
a political thing. It's much more a sort of

626
00:31:29.818 --> 00:31:32.578
be in their bonnet that they're right, they know

627
00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:34.630
that this is, you know, a solution and

628
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.779
often they've come to that out of a very sincere

629
00:31:38.348 --> 00:31:41.328
desire to confront either their own issues or issues in

630
00:31:41.338 --> 00:31:44.420
their family. Um You know, I want to

631
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.650
know, I um people who research suicide, for

632
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.000
example, a lot of people who research suicide have

633
00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.410
a, you know, sibling or parent who,

634
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.969
who kill themselves and it's very difficult, it's incredibly

635
00:31:56.979 --> 00:32:00.949
difficult to critique suicide research. You know, a

636
00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:05.328
lot of suicide research is terrible but you can't,

637
00:32:05.338 --> 00:32:07.939
it's very hard to go to suicide research and say

638
00:32:07.949 --> 00:32:10.459
stop doing this and be well, why do you

639
00:32:10.469 --> 00:32:15.189
not care about suicide? Really, really hard.

640
00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:16.140
So, yeah, there is, it seems to

641
00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.318
me there are a lot of, of, of

642
00:32:17.328 --> 00:32:22.568
psychologists whose they're more about the communication about the ideas

643
00:32:23.189 --> 00:32:27.809
than they are about the scientific side of it that

644
00:32:27.818 --> 00:32:29.930
, you know, treating it as if it was

645
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.848
uh a biomedical science where you collect data and do

646
00:32:31.858 --> 00:32:34.630
the analysis and draw the graphs and say, look

647
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.098
, this is, this is really happening. Um

648
00:32:37.108 --> 00:32:37.650
, and I, I don't know, I,

649
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.848
if people are watching this, who work in psychology

650
00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:42.689
departments, they may be nodding along going. Yeah

651
00:32:42.699 --> 00:32:45.390
, I have colleagues who, for whom the research

652
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.068
is kind of secondary, not in any sort of

653
00:32:47.078 --> 00:32:50.920
fraudulent way, but they are, they're kind of

654
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.348
special people, not in a science nerd, kind

655
00:32:54.358 --> 00:32:57.279
of a way. Um, you know, they

656
00:32:57.289 --> 00:33:00.130
may be very spiritual individuals, et cetera and that's

657
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.759
great, but it's quite difficult to be very spiritual

658
00:33:02.229 --> 00:33:04.920
, to be a really, really, really good

659
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.039
psychologist. You have to be extremely good at maths

660
00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:10.838
and extremely good with people. That's, that's a

661
00:33:10.848 --> 00:33:16.529
rare combination of skills. Uh So I I mean

662
00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:21.279
, it seems that there's also this sort of element

663
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:27.039
of uh potentially getting some social and moral backlash if

664
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:30.078
you're trying to critique some of these research, you

665
00:33:30.088 --> 00:33:32.868
mentioned suicide research there, for example, I mean

666
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.910
, so some of these research when it comes to

667
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:44.709
particularly very sensitive social topics is sort of v from

668
00:33:44.719 --> 00:33:50.029
criticism. Well, also because the majority of people

669
00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:53.680
who research, let's say a politically sensitive topic typically

670
00:33:53.689 --> 00:33:57.709
start out from a political point of view on that

671
00:33:58.449 --> 00:34:04.479
. So the majority of people who research police racism

672
00:34:05.328 --> 00:34:08.219
start off, I think from the point of view

673
00:34:08.228 --> 00:34:13.398
that there is a lot of police racism. Um

674
00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.360
the majority of people who look for race differences in

675
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:22.320
IQ probably start off from the idea that certain groups

676
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:30.398
are less intelligent than others um, and most people

677
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.300
, yeah, you're not going to go into that

678
00:34:31.309 --> 00:34:35.059
topic unless you're somewhat motivated to do it. And

679
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.889
so if it is a political topic, you're probably

680
00:34:37.898 --> 00:34:39.239
going to have an, a priori political position.

681
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.188
Now, maybe there are people who go along and

682
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.780
have epiphanies, uh, along the way. But

683
00:34:45.789 --> 00:34:49.139
it's very difficult when you come to, um,

684
00:34:49.148 --> 00:34:50.780
an entrenched, when you come with a, you

685
00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:52.458
know, an entrenched a priori political position. It's

686
00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:57.798
very difficult to, to accept, um, contrary

687
00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:01.389
, uh, empirical evidence. Um Michael Shermer had

688
00:35:01.398 --> 00:35:04.579
a book called Why People Believe weird things. And

689
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.708
one of the things he said is, uh,

690
00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:07.000
people believe or smart people. They, well,

691
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.090
one of the chapters is why the smart people believe

692
00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:10.500
weird things. And he said, well, the

693
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:15.349
thing is smart people are very good at unders justifying

694
00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.429
why they believe the weird things in the first place

695
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.639
. But they've still got to get the weird things

696
00:35:21.648 --> 00:35:22.849
kind of out of it. If you look at

697
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.909
smart people who are very religious and, and who

698
00:35:25.918 --> 00:35:29.918
are religious in the religion of their parents, you

699
00:35:29.929 --> 00:35:31.519
know, we all, you know, we're pretty

700
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.340
, we all know that the chance that the religion

701
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:36.199
of our parents is the right one. You know

702
00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:37.559
, certainly any sort of, you know, anyone

703
00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.500
with a logical and scientific brain should realize that any

704
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.070
, that the chance that the religion that your parents

705
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.539
happen to inculcate in you is the right one.

706
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:50.059
It's fairly small. Um And then, but you

707
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.679
see, you know, orthodox Jewish, orthodox Jewish

708
00:35:52.688 --> 00:35:57.090
particle physicists who are kind of discussing the, you

709
00:35:57.099 --> 00:35:58.820
know, the finest points of detail in the world

710
00:35:58.829 --> 00:36:00.559
. But they uh uh I, I saw one

711
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.309
such person being interviewed but she wasn't mixing pans with

712
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.648
like milk and meat or something and, and,

713
00:36:06.659 --> 00:36:07.610
you know, ditto for any other religion. Certainly

714
00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:13.489
not to um say anything about the uh uh Jewishness

715
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.530
. But if you're going to be have that,

716
00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:16.458
if you're going to say, as I, as

717
00:36:16.469 --> 00:36:19.159
a scientist, I am, you know, objective

718
00:36:19.168 --> 00:36:20.139
about the, you know, oh, and by

719
00:36:20.148 --> 00:36:21.769
the way, I have this corner with religion,

720
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.878
which I mean, maybe they try to defend with

721
00:36:22.889 --> 00:36:24.679
the religion objectively. But I think most people who

722
00:36:24.688 --> 00:36:27.639
are religious will say, ok, that's outside the

723
00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:31.840
, that's outside that box. Um You're already kind

724
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:35.978
of, to some extent justifying why you're, you

725
00:36:35.989 --> 00:36:37.179
know, you're not looking at that. I,

726
00:36:37.188 --> 00:36:38.250
I'm not certain if I'm making quite good sense here

727
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.789
. But, um, people are, yeah,

728
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.010
people justify themselves into that position and, um,

729
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.159
it's hard to get out of it and it will

730
00:36:49.168 --> 00:36:52.849
take a lot more, um, it'll take a

731
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.878
lot more co contradictory evidence before you start believing the

732
00:36:55.889 --> 00:37:00.489
opposite of your initial hypothesis, particularly if it was

733
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.159
the entire basis of you going into that field in

734
00:37:02.168 --> 00:37:07.099
the first place. Uh Very few people make that

735
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:13.349
transition. I'm thinking of um Hilda Bastian, a

736
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.250
science writer. And she started off as I think

737
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.139
she may have been anti vaccine, she was anti

738
00:37:20.148 --> 00:37:23.619
something. Um it may have been anti vaccine,

739
00:37:23.628 --> 00:37:29.090
anti some kind of medical procedure. Uh and she

740
00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:30.668
went and read the evidence and she realized that the

741
00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:36.510
evidence was actually true. And now she writes about

742
00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:38.898
um deniers, well, first of all about bad

743
00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:42.208
scientists, which is great, but also from the

744
00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:44.208
point of view of someone who's, you know,

745
00:37:44.978 --> 00:37:49.168
started off believing a lot of bad science. Um

746
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.909
And she's an absolute beacon from that point of view

747
00:37:51.918 --> 00:37:53.369
because she actually did the, she crossed the line

748
00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:55.559
, she crossed the line and will, I'm sure

749
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.099
would tell you, interview her, do interview her

750
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.280
Hilda Basket. She'd be a fantastic interview. She

751
00:38:00.289 --> 00:38:02.300
would tell you. Uh Yeah, you know,

752
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:06.349
I used to believe this and here's why and most

753
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.289
of us who've been, most of us have been

754
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.489
lifelong. Most scientists have been lifelong scientists. We

755
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.269
haven't had to undergo that conversion. We can't tell

756
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.119
you what it was like the day when we realized

757
00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:20.728
that Chem Trails couldn't be real. Um So people

758
00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:22.688
who've been through that journey, I think uh uh

759
00:38:22.699 --> 00:38:23.949
but they are, they are few and far between

760
00:38:24.148 --> 00:38:27.628
and, and even more. So when you've made

761
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.429
a public position and when you're, you've got a

762
00:38:30.438 --> 00:38:32.938
book deal, you know, you, you've got

763
00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:36.000
a book deal, you've maybe you might have written

764
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.570
two or three or four popular Bestselling books on YX

765
00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:42.599
is the way to lose weight, become happy all

766
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.438
of that. And even if just in those moments

767
00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:49.449
before the, before you fall asleep, you have

768
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:52.159
a little bit of a doubt, you're probably not

769
00:38:52.168 --> 00:38:57.699
gonna co um phone your publisher and say Pulp the

770
00:38:57.708 --> 00:39:02.918
lot. I just realized it's garbage. Yeah.

771
00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:07.349
So uh uh still on the topic of well being

772
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.409
, I would also like to hear a little bit

773
00:39:10.418 --> 00:39:15.030
about your critique of another study in this case by

774
00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:20.739
Frederickson at all, uh uh uh work on the

775
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.978
relationship between genomics and well-being because at a certain point

776
00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:29.369
there, you also mentioned that, I mean,

777
00:39:29.478 --> 00:39:31.489
there could be, or there might be some sort

778
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.099
of genetic basis to this to some extent. But

779
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.829
in the, in the, in the case of

780
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.530
that particular study, what would you find as the

781
00:39:42.539 --> 00:39:46.750
main a conceptual and statistical? Yeah, this was

782
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.579
, this was quite the, this was quite the

783
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.219
uh quite the study. Um Frederickson presented it at

784
00:39:52.228 --> 00:39:54.260
a conference with a um a picture of a couple

785
00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:55.820
of the charts, one of them going one way

786
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:58.269
and one of them going the other way for the

787
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.429
, the two conditions. Uh And the uh the

788
00:40:00.438 --> 00:40:02.909
title of the slide was an objective basis for moral

789
00:40:02.918 --> 00:40:07.418
philosophy question mark which um there, there were two

790
00:40:07.429 --> 00:40:09.800
main problems uh with this study and I presume you'll

791
00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:13.510
put the reference in the notes. Um The first

792
00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:16.019
was that it was it was about the sixth or

793
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:21.760
seventh study that the s last author had produced,

794
00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:28.059
using a way of analyzing uh data which is completely

795
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.918
invalid. He basically made up his own statistical method

796
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.989
and this method is going to lead to large numbers

797
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.610
of false positives. Uh And I, I've cried

798
00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:40.079
, I predicted another paper where someone had done something

799
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.628
similar and they, and they replied, but we

800
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.309
replicated it. It's like, yes, because your

801
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:50.570
, your method reliably produces large numbers of false positives

802
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:52.360
. Um So that was the, the first problem

803
00:40:52.369 --> 00:40:55.550
is the method was nonsense. Um An even bigger

804
00:40:55.559 --> 00:41:00.398
problem, however, was that when they were coding

805
00:41:00.409 --> 00:41:05.519
up the data, uh they decided that they,

806
00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.800
they collected data on people with this rather strange American

807
00:41:07.809 --> 00:41:12.550
way of collecting race. So uh Amer the the

808
00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:17.378
US US scientists used the census definition of race from

809
00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:22.250
about 1910. And in the 1910 US census,

810
00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:29.869
there was black, white, uh native American Asian

811
00:41:30.159 --> 00:41:34.289
, which kind of meant Japanese immigrant, uh Hawaiian

812
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.010
and Pacific Islander. Now, clearly those are not

813
00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:38.769
, you know, in any way representative of,

814
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.389
of, of, of the human population. But

815
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.188
OK, there was Hawaii and there was Guam.

816
00:41:44.199 --> 00:41:45.119
So we kind of had to include them. There

817
00:41:45.128 --> 00:41:47.739
isn't, for example, a code for Hispanic and

818
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.300
Hispanic is orthogonal to race and you can be black

819
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:54.989
Hispanic or white Hispanic. So uh and nobody dares

820
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.539
touch these now because obviously to try and re you

821
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.010
know, reconstruct that would be just a political nightmare

822
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:05.030
. Anyway, they collected these data and either they

823
00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:07.590
didn't get a significant result, but for whatever reason

824
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:08.909
, they decided to recode them as white and not

825
00:42:08.918 --> 00:42:14.030
white. So instead of white being one and all

826
00:42:14.039 --> 00:42:16.000
the others being 23456, they just had uh white

827
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.179
is one and everything else is zero. And they

828
00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:21.139
must have done this by hand because they left a

829
00:42:21.148 --> 00:42:22.949
four in. So they had all these ones,

830
00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:25.050
all these zeros and a four. And they then

831
00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:30.519
used that without noticing as a binary variable in a

832
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:34.280
regression. And basically, if they held all ones

833
00:42:34.289 --> 00:42:35.860
and zeros, it wouldn't have mattered if they'd been

834
00:42:35.869 --> 00:42:37.019
ones and zeros or fours and twos. But as

835
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.619
soon as you have three values for what should be

836
00:42:39.628 --> 00:42:42.969
a binary variable in your aggression, they actually start

837
00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:46.820
behaving like real numbers. So we discovered this and

838
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:50.010
we found that. So again, let's pretend that

839
00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:52.179
the method isn't full of statistical artifacts. Let's pretend

840
00:42:52.188 --> 00:42:55.789
that the method is correct. Even with that method

841
00:42:57.039 --> 00:43:01.648
. When you corrected this incorrectly coded person, the

842
00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:07.378
main effect of the study reversed. Hm. Did

843
00:43:07.389 --> 00:43:08.909
it reverse or did it halve or both? Anyway

844
00:43:08.918 --> 00:43:14.619
, it was drastically altered simply by changing that one

845
00:43:14.628 --> 00:43:20.260
data plot. So we wrote this up in our

846
00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:24.918
rebuttal. And what happened was the authors. So

847
00:43:24.929 --> 00:43:27.878
we said to people, but if you download this

848
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:30.128
file from this gene database and you run their code

849
00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:30.489
. This is what will happen and look, here's

850
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.780
that form. The authors took that data file,

851
00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:39.449
corrected the four and re uploaded it. They didn't

852
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:42.469
tell anyone, they didn't put a note on it

853
00:43:42.478 --> 00:43:44.610
. They didn't tell us and they didn't tell the

854
00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:46.688
journal. So now anyone who downloads it will go

855
00:43:46.699 --> 00:43:49.648
. Well, what's this brown sl what are they

856
00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:54.090
talking about? The results are? Um So yeah

857
00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:59.119
, a combination of the method was completely wrong and

858
00:43:59.128 --> 00:44:01.989
there were errors in the data. Um And so

859
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.989
the whole thing was just nonsense, just complete nonsense

860
00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:07.750
. Uh But you know, it took quite,

861
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.989
it took, it took many, many hours and

862
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.628
days of dredging through. You know, the data

863
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:16.510
file is like 35 megabytes or something. It's complete

864
00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:20.070
genomic analysis and then all these variables that go along

865
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:22.469
with it. So, yeah, the method was

866
00:44:22.478 --> 00:44:24.989
wrong and they hadn't even implemented the method correctly.

867
00:44:25.918 --> 00:44:29.739
Uh We wrote to the editors and said, we

868
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.800
really think you ought to retract this paper. It's

869
00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:34.458
based on, you know, we can argue about

870
00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:37.760
whether the method. Yeah, it, it is

871
00:44:37.769 --> 00:44:39.668
full of artifacts. Here are several statisticians who will

872
00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:40.978
tell you it is. But OK, that's a

873
00:44:40.989 --> 00:44:45.369
scientific argument. But the data had this error in

874
00:44:45.378 --> 00:44:45.878
it and when you correct it, the, the

875
00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:50.760
effect goes away. Um And the authors tried to

876
00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:52.708
sneak a new version of the data past you and

877
00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:55.478
the um the editor refused to uh to consider it

878
00:44:55.929 --> 00:44:58.909
. So when he got fired a couple of years

879
00:44:58.918 --> 00:45:00.860
later for some me too stuff, uh, I

880
00:45:00.869 --> 00:45:02.989
, we were, I was quite pleased. But

881
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.739
, um, yeah, so that's, and,

882
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.760
and that was an interesting example but an entirely typical

883
00:45:07.769 --> 00:45:13.378
example of how science doesn't get corrected because in the

884
00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:15.340
same way that if you've got a theory and you're

885
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:16.989
committed to it, it's embarrassing to come back for

886
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.860
it. It's very embarrassing for a journal edit to

887
00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:21.659
, to admit that they published a, a garbage

888
00:45:21.668 --> 00:45:23.228
paper, uh, with, with data errors in

889
00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:25.070
it that, that completely trashed the results. So

890
00:45:25.079 --> 00:45:28.099
they just pretend it didn't happen and hope no one

891
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.898
will notice. Mhm. But, but when it

892
00:45:30.909 --> 00:45:35.500
comes to the statistical analysis that were applied in this

893
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:39.050
particular study, since we're talking about genetics here,

894
00:45:39.128 --> 00:45:44.219
do you find that perhaps some of the issues would

895
00:45:44.228 --> 00:45:50.659
also extend to other genetics research or you'd have to

896
00:45:50.668 --> 00:45:52.119
talk to a genetics researcher? Um, I do

897
00:45:52.128 --> 00:45:58.550
know that, um, about 15 years ago there

898
00:45:58.559 --> 00:46:01.750
were problems because people were attempting to identify which gene

899
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.360
was responsible for this or that phenomenon, uh,

900
00:46:05.369 --> 00:46:08.938
by basically, uh testing 35,000 genes, uh,

901
00:46:08.949 --> 00:46:12.909
and seeing which of them were associated with an outcome

902
00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:16.179
without making the necessary statistical corrections. And so they

903
00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:20.860
were generating huge amounts of, um, of,

904
00:46:20.869 --> 00:46:22.500
of false, false positives. But you'd have to

905
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.070
talk to somebody who knows a lot more than me

906
00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:25.699
about genetic research. I, I had to do

907
00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:28.438
quite a lot of learning in, in quite a

908
00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:30.929
hurry for that paper and I've forgotten most of it

909
00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:36.590
now. OK. So let's move on from uh

910
00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:39.409
happiness and well being here because I, I would

911
00:46:39.418 --> 00:46:43.769
also like to get into another paper, this one

912
00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:49.978
from 2015 by Thorstenson Pastor and Elliot. Where,

913
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.550
I mean, uh th this is very interesting and

914
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.059
funny in a way, I guess they sort of

915
00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:01.570
offered evidence from two experiments that perception of colors and

916
00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:04.199
in this case, it was on the blue,

917
00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:08.079
yellow axis was impaired if the participants have watched the

918
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:13.398
sad movie clip. Compared to part, if you're

919
00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:15.090
feeling blue, you can't see blue or something.

920
00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:20.418
Yeah. And this was compared to participants who watched

921
00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:24.208
clips designed to induce a happy or neutral mood.

922
00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:28.809
So, what were the main issues, methodologically speaking

923
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.599
here? Um I, I, I've always been

924
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.750
surprised that that, well, I mean, I

925
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.539
presume this, I think this is done with undergraduates

926
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.019
. I've always been surprised that um undergraduates who have

927
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.559
been watching four hours of TV, since per day

928
00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:44.918
, since they were four years old. Um So

929
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:47.780
they've probably watched 20,000 hours of television. And apparently

930
00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:51.530
psychologists believe that if you show them a mildly sad

931
00:47:51.539 --> 00:47:52.860
or a mildly funny clip for about six minutes that

932
00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.550
they will all of a sudden be in some kind

933
00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:57.648
of, you know, happy or sad mood.

934
00:47:57.659 --> 00:47:59.610
But apparently we have to stipulate that we have to

935
00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:01.869
accept that um the bigger problem in this study is

936
00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:06.489
that the uh the results were fabricated. So uh

937
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.250
there's not really a lot of point in going any

938
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.929
further. Um The editor of the adjourn at the

939
00:48:09.938 --> 00:48:12.989
time is a terrifically nice chap. And he didn't

940
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.958
want to get into too much of a confrontation with

941
00:48:14.969 --> 00:48:17.668
the authors. So um a suitable fig leaf was

942
00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:20.969
arranged in terms of the reason for the retraction,

943
00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:22.840
but it's, it was abundantly obvious if you looked

944
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:25.208
at the data set that these numbers had been fabricated

945
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.309
. Um So obviously, you can get any result

946
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.659
you like if you just make them, make,

947
00:48:30.668 --> 00:48:30.969
make, make them, make the numbers up.

948
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.679
Um So yeah, that was, that was nice

949
00:48:37.688 --> 00:48:39.760
and simple. That was a, that was probably

950
00:48:39.769 --> 00:48:42.688
the first case I worked on where I actually had

951
00:48:42.699 --> 00:48:43.860
data in front of me. And I go,

952
00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:49.378
yeah, this is obvious fraudulent. Yeah. Uh

953
00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:52.668
And so uh from the same year actually, and

954
00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:57.239
we're talking about this sort of thing nowadays, I

955
00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:00.530
guess with Twitter and other kinds of social media.

956
00:49:00.539 --> 00:49:06.438
So there was also this study on how supposedly through

957
00:49:06.449 --> 00:49:12.820
Twitter language, uh the authors could reliably predict heart

958
00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.780
disease. And this was um I mean the name

959
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:19.659
here is a bit complicated. I stabbed by it

960
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.550
all. Yeah. So what, what are the

961
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.260
criticisms here? And by the way, do you

962
00:49:23.269 --> 00:49:28.449
think that they would extend since I'm mentioning uh the

963
00:49:28.458 --> 00:49:30.559
uh the fact that we still talk a lot about

964
00:49:30.628 --> 00:49:35.648
how much reliable information we can get from uh,

965
00:49:35.659 --> 00:49:39.269
patterns of language and other sorts of activity on social

966
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.769
media. Uh, ab about this or that kind

967
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.184
of issue that we can. So, do you

968
00:49:45.195 --> 00:49:52.043
think that these would apply to other research using Twitter

969
00:49:52.054 --> 00:49:53.385
or other social media? They, no, I

970
00:49:53.394 --> 00:49:55.724
mean, everything's far too noisy. They were just

971
00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:58.644
, they, they, they ran enough models so

972
00:49:58.655 --> 00:50:00.885
that eventually they managed to model some noise down to

973
00:50:00.894 --> 00:50:05.204
a P value of 0.049. Um And if you

974
00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:07.563
get 0.05 someone will publish it. Uh And uh

975
00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:10.559
they, it, yeah, they, there were

976
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.628
all sorts of things wrong with that paper at one

977
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:15.340
point. They were, they were using some reference

978
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:17.719
data. Uh but it turned out that was from

979
00:50:17.728 --> 00:50:20.639
Facebook, not from Twitter. And, you know

980
00:50:20.648 --> 00:50:22.719
, Facebook and Twitter populations are different. Um They

981
00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:24.809
showed a map of, you know, this area

982
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.878
is close, it looks like that area and it

983
00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:30.010
, it wasn't, there were hundreds of differences but

984
00:50:30.019 --> 00:50:34.039
it was kind of visually impressive. Um And,

985
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.050
you know, basically, uh uh what I was

986
00:50:36.059 --> 00:50:38.168
saying earlier, there are someone, the uh the

987
00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:42.119
couple of the people on that paper have this idea

988
00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:45.079
that you can with machine learning or with big,

989
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:51.889
big linear models d discern trends in extremely noisy data

990
00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:53.829
. And the answer is you can't, and you

991
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.188
know, they, they didn't realize that their data

992
00:50:57.199 --> 00:51:00.208
had been censored somewhat by Twitter. So they thought

993
00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:01.648
they were getting pure data. Uh, Twitter had

994
00:51:01.659 --> 00:51:04.829
taken out a lot of stuff. So this was

995
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.708
about the claim of the study was not that angry

996
00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:10.570
people get heart disease. The claim of the study

997
00:51:10.579 --> 00:51:15.090
was that US counties where there was more anger expressed

998
00:51:15.099 --> 00:51:19.599
on Twitter had higher rates of heart disease, which

999
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.019
would typically be among non Twitter users. The data

1000
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.699
were from like 2011 and 2012 when there weren't that

1001
00:51:24.708 --> 00:51:28.590
many people on Twitter and the kind of people uh

1002
00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:31.030
who get, uh who get uh atherosclerotic heart disease

1003
00:51:31.079 --> 00:51:34.510
uh tend not to be on Twitter anyway. But

1004
00:51:34.519 --> 00:51:36.059
you had this idea of an, you know,

1005
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.349
an angry county full of, I don't know,

1006
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.019
rednecks, whatever. Uh And it turned out,

1007
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.780
yeah, Twitter was censoring the data. So there

1008
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:45.769
was all kinds of anger related stuff uh in the

1009
00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.320
data that wasn't in, that wasn't in, wasn't

1010
00:51:49.329 --> 00:51:52.969
there that wasn't given to them because Twitter bowdlerized uh

1011
00:51:52.978 --> 00:51:53.789
the data, they took some of the rude words

1012
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.489
out. Um Then I showed that if you,

1013
00:51:58.719 --> 00:52:00.469
um if you, instead of looking for anger,

1014
00:52:00.478 --> 00:52:05.128
you looked for upbeat things, but that also predicted

1015
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.280
, I can't remember if I said it predicted heart

1016
00:52:07.289 --> 00:52:08.340
disease or if it predicted cancer. But basically,

1017
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:12.168
if you've got enough variables, you know, that

1018
00:52:12.179 --> 00:52:14.849
if, if anger is predicting that particular form of

1019
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.530
heart disease, well, how many other forms of

1020
00:52:15.539 --> 00:52:17.449
disease did they look at and which ones did they

1021
00:52:17.458 --> 00:52:22.070
choose to publish? Uh So it was, it

1022
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:23.989
was just a, it was just flashy nonsense.

1023
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.599
It was flashy nonsense but it didn't prove anything at

1024
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.800
all. Uh But the reviewers of that paper could

1025
00:52:30.809 --> 00:52:34.628
not possibly have understood it. I mean, I

1026
00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:36.449
, I have a degree in computer science and it

1027
00:52:36.458 --> 00:52:37.889
took me 2.5 days to download all the stuff that

1028
00:52:37.898 --> 00:52:40.739
I needed to get the model to run. Uh

1029
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:45.300
nn none of the reviewers ran any of those models

1030
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:47.019
to replicate them. So they would have just gone

1031
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.898
. Oh, there's this big complex computer model.

1032
00:52:49.909 --> 00:52:51.800
Well, it must be right. Well, you

1033
00:52:51.809 --> 00:52:52.478
know, the model, the model could be wrong

1034
00:52:52.489 --> 00:52:54.019
and I have no way of knowing that, but

1035
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:57.300
a big complex software model. Uh I mean,

1036
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:58.728
this is a, this is a uh a more

1037
00:52:58.739 --> 00:53:00.469
general problem for science is that a lot of the

1038
00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:01.659
time, even if you trust that the people collected

1039
00:53:01.668 --> 00:53:06.378
the data, you're also trusting that their 12,000 lines

1040
00:53:06.389 --> 00:53:07.849
of code doesn't have any bugs in it. Well

1041
00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.929
, you know, your, your, your viewers

1042
00:53:09.938 --> 00:53:13.360
who know a bit about software, maybe uh having

1043
00:53:13.369 --> 00:53:15.438
a bit of a smile at that. Um And

1044
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:17.679
so, you know, we ran this model and

1045
00:53:17.688 --> 00:53:20.208
look these numbers came out. Can we have a

1046
00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:22.820
publication now, please? Just, you know,

1047
00:53:22.378 --> 00:53:24.570
and, and as I say, we, I

1048
00:53:24.579 --> 00:53:27.579
demonstrate, for example, one of the things was

1049
00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.688
if you cut the new outage states in half,

1050
00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:30.619
the effect was only present in the north of the

1051
00:53:30.628 --> 00:53:32.269
United, in the south of the United States and

1052
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.619
not the north or vice versa. Well, there's

1053
00:53:36.628 --> 00:53:39.228
no theoretical reason why angry people in your county,

1054
00:53:39.239 --> 00:53:43.820
north of, of Missouri uh would, would cause

1055
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:45.750
you to have more heart disease in that county and

1056
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.708
not in the south. And then I found two

1057
00:53:46.719 --> 00:53:51.208
counties in Indiana that were like next to each other

1058
00:53:51.409 --> 00:53:52.539
and one of them was 10 times more angry but

1059
00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:55.659
had half the heart disease. So there's no,

1060
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.179
there's no useful, the, the, the the

1061
00:53:59.188 --> 00:54:00.119
biggest problem with that article was, it was like

1062
00:54:00.128 --> 00:54:05.929
claiming that somehow health authorities were going to be able

1063
00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:07.090
to, you know, oh, let's not,

1064
00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:09.969
you know, what's the best predictor of this year's

1065
00:54:09.978 --> 00:54:14.409
mortality from heart disease? And the answer is last

1066
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:19.610
year's mortality from heart disease, um especially since uh

1067
00:54:19.619 --> 00:54:22.079
the determination of mortality from heart disease is what's written

1068
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:23.860
on the death certificate. And it turns out there

1069
00:54:23.869 --> 00:54:30.789
are enormous differences in medical diagnosing practice based on local

1070
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.208
cultural factors sometimes including whether one particular doctor had a

1071
00:54:35.219 --> 00:54:36.739
big influence. You know, if you're in a

1072
00:54:36.769 --> 00:54:39.030
uh an area with a big city hospital and,

1073
00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:40.699
you know, oh, for the last 50 years

1074
00:54:40.708 --> 00:54:43.519
ever since professor. So and so we, we

1075
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:46.159
try not to say that it's atherosclerotic heart disease because

1076
00:54:46.168 --> 00:54:49.978
we look for these other more subtle factors or vice

1077
00:54:49.989 --> 00:54:52.938
versa. And So it's all of these extremely noisy

1078
00:54:52.949 --> 00:54:57.019
measures being thrown into a regression. Eventually something's going

1079
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.000
to kind of pop out one side or the other

1080
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.239
. Um, and it, you know, but

1081
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.869
it, it's not useful. Uh But it makes

1082
00:55:02.878 --> 00:55:06.059
, again, it makes, it's a press friendly

1083
00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:07.519
story. The press likes to say, oh,

1084
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.360
wow, pretty soon we'll be able to see whether

1085
00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:12.639
, you know, you're, you're likely to get

1086
00:55:12.648 --> 00:55:14.760
heart disease based on what, what's, what's being

1087
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:15.840
tweeted in your neighborhood. Oh, wow. Gee

1088
00:55:15.849 --> 00:55:21.309
whiz. Um you know, sorry, predicting heart

1089
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:24.519
disease was going to continue to be um difficult.

1090
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.320
But the best basis we have for it is,

1091
00:55:28.389 --> 00:55:30.628
you know, what happened last year and how much

1092
00:55:30.639 --> 00:55:32.559
pizza you eat. So and a lot of this

1093
00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:37.728
is about cute, so cute stuff gets published.

1094
00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:39.469
The thing about, oh Feeling Blue makes you see

1095
00:55:39.478 --> 00:55:44.168
blue or rather not or something. Uh And all

1096
00:55:44.179 --> 00:55:46.820
of these articles get coverage in Huffington Post and even

1097
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:49.519
in, you know, the Daily Mail and even

1098
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:52.030
in the Times sometimes, um because we've got to

1099
00:55:52.039 --> 00:55:55.849
generate content and so psychologists to some extent can also

1100
00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:00.978
, or scientists and university press offices. Uh Although

1101
00:56:01.708 --> 00:56:04.478
my colleague, Chris Chambers had a look at that

1102
00:56:04.489 --> 00:56:07.458
and determined that the scientists aren't always completely. Oh

1103
00:56:07.469 --> 00:56:08.269
, yes. The press office made me do it

1104
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.340
. No, no. But the press offices are

1105
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:15.000
producing these, you know, stories uh and feeding

1106
00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.878
them to their friendly journalists and scientists at the university

1107
00:56:17.889 --> 00:56:20.530
of whatever. And then they can go, hey

1108
00:56:20.539 --> 00:56:22.239
, University of wherever is in the news again with

1109
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:25.519
our world leading research. So it's all part of

1110
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:30.860
that kind of mutually reinforcing, um, world of

1111
00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:35.918
, um, en entertainment, water cooler discussion.

1112
00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.728
Clicks. It just feeds that and, but it's

1113
00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:42.639
all nonsense. Almost all nonsense. So we can't

1114
00:56:42.659 --> 00:56:44.610
tell what is it? Ok. So, uh

1115
00:56:44.619 --> 00:56:47.489
, le let's get a little bit more into what

1116
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:52.250
might be behind the bad science here. I mean

1117
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.329
, we could have gone through some more studies that

1118
00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.668
you yourself debunked or found flaws with. But let's

1119
00:56:59.679 --> 00:57:02.500
get into some more general questions and issues here.

1120
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:07.889
So when it comes to perhaps having a better understanding

1121
00:57:07.898 --> 00:57:12.550
of where bad science stems from and the factors and

1122
00:57:12.668 --> 00:57:15.800
do you think that uh it is better to try

1123
00:57:15.809 --> 00:57:17.449
to approach it at an individual level? I mean

1124
00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:22.699
, is it mostly about people, individuals with certain

1125
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:29.159
personality or psychological traits uh having a tendency to particularly

1126
00:57:29.168 --> 00:57:32.300
produce fraudulent data and studies or is it more a

1127
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:36.789
systemic issue? And if it's a systemic issue,

1128
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.719
then we might get into some of the main factors

1129
00:57:39.728 --> 00:57:42.820
here. I mean, I think mostly it's an

1130
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:45.179
, it's an interaction of the two but the,

1131
00:57:45.188 --> 00:57:46.530
the, the system, as it itself, the

1132
00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:53.619
system itself, the scientific production system um you know

1133
00:57:53.628 --> 00:57:58.978
, exists in an economic context and you know,

1134
00:57:58.989 --> 00:58:01.239
the economists, uh most of them who aren't making

1135
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:04.489
their data up, but economists can tell you if

1136
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.219
you, if you show an economist from Mars,

1137
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.938
uh, if you describe the system in which scientific

1138
00:58:10.949 --> 00:58:14.639
research takes place, uh, they will tell you

1139
00:58:14.648 --> 00:58:15.639
exactly what's going to happen, which is that people

1140
00:58:15.648 --> 00:58:20.789
are gonna respond to incentives. Um, and we

1141
00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:22.398
, we have this idea of the scientists as the

1142
00:58:22.409 --> 00:58:28.188
kind of 19th century gentleman Sikh, uh, with

1143
00:58:28.199 --> 00:58:30.159
, you know, independently wealthy and, and dabbling

1144
00:58:30.179 --> 00:58:34.510
in things to, you know, to plant species

1145
00:58:34.519 --> 00:58:37.800
or, you know, the odd uh still,

1146
00:58:37.809 --> 00:58:38.760
you know, seeing if you can get chlorine gas

1147
00:58:38.769 --> 00:58:43.849
out of it or whatever, um uh very much

1148
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.000
all the sort of, you know, the noble

1149
00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:50.239
, the noble cause of, of advancing human knowledge

1150
00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:53.079
. Um But first and foremost, scientists are employees

1151
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:59.398
, they are working in an economic system, they

1152
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.878
need to go home at the end of the day

1153
00:59:00.889 --> 00:59:06.340
and put food on the table. Um They worry

1154
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:09.449
about their career, they worry about uh their visas

1155
00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:15.679
. If they're from another country, they also have

1156
00:59:15.688 --> 00:59:20.228
normal human drives and desires such as prestige, um

1157
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.168
you know, bettering themselves, making a lot of

1158
00:59:22.179 --> 00:59:28.559
money in some cases and the way science is set

1159
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:31.938
up makes it relatively easy if you are prepared to

1160
00:59:31.949 --> 00:59:35.280
be a bad actor to do that. Now,

1161
00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:37.750
I don't know whether there are, you know,

1162
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.309
more sociopaths or more generally bad people in science than

1163
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.300
any other uh domain, you know, like banking

1164
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:47.739
or uh you, you quite often read out someone

1165
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.059
the other day on Twitter. I, I had

1166
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.360
some sympathy with them and they, they were trying

1167
00:59:52.369 --> 00:59:54.010
to sort of fill in their expenses from their university

1168
00:59:54.019 --> 00:59:57.228
and they had to jump through hoops to get$30

1169
00:59:57.239 --> 00:59:59.789
reimbursed. And they said, you know, it

1170
00:59:59.800 --> 00:60:01.878
always seems to be the university administrators themselves who've been

1171
00:60:01.889 --> 00:60:06.224
creaming tens of thousands of dollars a year off the

1172
00:60:06.235 --> 00:60:07.985
top when the scandals come to light. You know

1173
00:60:07.994 --> 00:60:10.023
, it isn't, it isn't the, the research

1174
00:60:10.034 --> 00:60:14.644
who goes to two conferences a year over claiming$40

1175
00:60:14.655 --> 00:60:16.135
on a taxi ride, that's going to be what

1176
00:60:16.144 --> 00:60:19.023
, uh, what breaks the budget. So,

1177
00:60:19.034 --> 00:60:23.800
but, um, people, people of all kinds

1178
00:60:23.809 --> 00:60:30.289
and all classes and all backgrounds are exposed to temptations

1179
00:60:30.300 --> 00:60:34.688
to cheat whether that's professionally financially, uh, et

1180
00:60:34.699 --> 00:60:38.809
cetera. And we shouldn't expect scientists to be any

1181
00:60:38.820 --> 00:60:42.039
different. I sort of give this analogy of,

1182
00:60:42.320 --> 00:60:44.820
uh, when your university, when it comes to

1183
00:60:44.829 --> 00:60:45.840
the end of the month or the fortnight in the

1184
00:60:45.849 --> 00:60:47.570
US when it comes to the end of the month

1185
00:60:47.659 --> 00:60:50.929
, uh, you get a payslip, uh,

1186
00:60:50.938 --> 00:60:52.929
saying, you know, your gross pay your net

1187
00:60:52.938 --> 00:60:55.688
pay after tax. And they say, and we've

1188
00:60:55.699 --> 00:60:58.668
sent this money to your bank account. What they

1189
00:60:58.679 --> 00:61:00.579
don't do is say, ok, your net pay

1190
00:61:00.590 --> 00:61:04.019
after tax is 3.5 1000 just go along to room

1191
00:61:04.030 --> 00:61:07.869
47 and take 35€100 bills off the top of

1192
00:61:07.878 --> 00:61:13.039
the pile. They don't know why don't they trust

1193
00:61:13.050 --> 00:61:20.849
you. Uh And yet we allow scientists essentially without

1194
00:61:20.860 --> 00:61:23.878
any external supervision, certainly without any external supervision,

1195
00:61:24.099 --> 00:61:27.090
you know, of the kind that could say stop

1196
00:61:27.099 --> 00:61:31.300
, you can't do that uh to um mark their

1197
00:61:31.309 --> 00:61:35.329
own homework, decide themselves what numbers they're going to

1198
00:61:35.340 --> 00:61:38.530
present. Um And one number will get you a

1199
00:61:38.539 --> 00:61:43.840
book deal and the other number won't. Um you

1200
00:61:43.849 --> 00:61:45.550
know, that's quite a temptation. You have to

1201
00:61:45.559 --> 00:61:50.309
be more than averagely honest to turn down the prospect

1202
00:61:50.320 --> 00:61:53.869
of a quarter million dollar book deal based on publishing

1203
00:61:53.878 --> 00:61:59.929
or not publishing a result. Um So yeah,

1204
00:61:59.938 --> 00:62:01.570
we expo we, we at the top, I

1205
00:62:01.579 --> 00:62:04.208
mean, not, not very, not many scientists

1206
00:62:04.219 --> 00:62:05.679
do this, but at the top, the rewards

1207
00:62:05.688 --> 00:62:08.769
are very high and therefore the temptations are, are

1208
00:62:08.780 --> 00:62:10.389
are there. But even in the middling level,

1209
00:62:10.719 --> 00:62:15.019
um we see this particularly in China where, you

1210
00:62:15.030 --> 00:62:17.188
know, you've gotta have this amount of publications to

1211
00:62:17.199 --> 00:62:20.010
continue, but it happens in the West too.

1212
00:62:20.019 --> 00:62:22.070
It just seems to be more of a uh and

1213
00:62:22.079 --> 00:62:23.590
, and so people will pay somebody to write a

1214
00:62:23.599 --> 00:62:28.378
paper for and then they can say, yes,

1215
00:62:28.389 --> 00:62:30.418
I published this paper and no one's ever gonna come

1216
00:62:30.429 --> 00:62:30.938
along and say so tell, no one's gonna give

1217
00:62:30.949 --> 00:62:34.269
them a, a spontaneous Viber, no one's gonna

1218
00:62:34.280 --> 00:62:37.250
say so tell me about this. So this variable

1219
00:62:37.260 --> 00:62:38.438
moderates this and they're gonna sit there, they didn't

1220
00:62:38.449 --> 00:62:43.219
write it, they didn't understand it. Um So

1221
00:62:43.228 --> 00:62:45.128
yeah, I say in, in, in particularly

1222
00:62:45.139 --> 00:62:46.619
China. It's got to the point where large numbers

1223
00:62:46.628 --> 00:62:49.610
of people are just having papers written for them.

1224
00:62:50.260 --> 00:62:52.619
Uh, but all over the world you've got all

1225
00:62:52.628 --> 00:62:54.239
of these do, um phd candidates and post docs

1226
00:62:54.250 --> 00:62:58.219
desperate to keep their job, keep their visa,

1227
00:62:58.228 --> 00:63:00.760
et cetera and who will do what it takes.

1228
00:63:00.360 --> 00:63:02.949
And particularly if they're, uh, you know,

1229
00:63:02.958 --> 00:63:05.909
the, the boss of their lab who is pretty

1230
00:63:05.918 --> 00:63:07.938
much God, you know, there's no other sort

1231
00:63:07.949 --> 00:63:10.958
of appeal, um, tells you to come up

1232
00:63:10.969 --> 00:63:14.079
with, you know, data that show the right

1233
00:63:14.090 --> 00:63:15.239
num the right results. Well, you're gonna give

1234
00:63:15.250 --> 00:63:20.128
them that data or you have to leave or you

1235
00:63:20.139 --> 00:63:22.168
have to leave and a lot of people do leave

1236
00:63:22.659 --> 00:63:24.809
, they walk away from science, uh, because

1237
00:63:24.820 --> 00:63:27.898
they're too disgusted about what they were being asked to

1238
00:63:27.909 --> 00:63:30.128
do, but most of them don't blow the whistle

1239
00:63:30.449 --> 00:63:32.829
on the way out because the bar for doing so

1240
00:63:32.840 --> 00:63:37.389
is very high. The evidentiary bar for proving that

1241
00:63:37.398 --> 00:63:38.809
somebody committed fraud is very high. And now,

1242
00:63:38.820 --> 00:63:40.449
as we've seen in, in, in a recent

1243
00:63:40.458 --> 00:63:44.969
case, we've even got somebody credibly accused of fraud

1244
00:63:44.978 --> 00:63:46.329
and, and then, um, claiming that it's

1245
00:63:46.340 --> 00:63:50.989
malicious libel, you know, to point out that

1246
00:63:51.000 --> 00:63:53.449
none of these numbers add up. So, um

1247
00:63:53.458 --> 00:63:55.510
, it's, it, it, you're very unlikely

1248
00:63:55.519 --> 00:64:00.398
to get caught, uh committing scientific misconduct. And

1249
00:64:00.409 --> 00:64:02.360
historically, you've certainly been very unlikely to get caught

1250
00:64:02.590 --> 00:64:04.269
. And so if you're in a situation where you

1251
00:64:04.280 --> 00:64:06.599
have a choice between two options. A and B

1252
00:64:06.949 --> 00:64:11.139
. Uh One of them will either make you rich

1253
00:64:11.148 --> 00:64:14.239
or at least ensure your continuing employment and visa and

1254
00:64:14.250 --> 00:64:15.750
the other won't. Um, and no one will

1255
00:64:15.760 --> 00:64:18.969
ever find out that you cheated to get to this

1256
00:64:18.978 --> 00:64:23.840
result. Um It doesn't surprise me that a lot

1257
00:64:23.849 --> 00:64:26.250
of people do. That doesn't surprise me at all

1258
00:64:26.409 --> 00:64:27.570
. I think we would be, it would be

1259
00:64:27.579 --> 00:64:30.148
really weird if, if we discovered that no scientist

1260
00:64:30.159 --> 00:64:31.280
ever did cheat, we would want to sort of

1261
00:64:31.289 --> 00:64:33.519
bottle whatever it is. They've got cos we could

1262
00:64:33.530 --> 00:64:38.398
use that with every other aspect of human endeavor,

1263
00:64:38.409 --> 00:64:41.010
you know, politicians, et cetera. Um But

1264
00:64:41.019 --> 00:64:42.349
, you know, it, it's just not the

1265
00:64:42.360 --> 00:64:44.969
case, it's just not the case, but science

1266
00:64:44.978 --> 00:64:45.929
is set up and, and the popular view of

1267
00:64:45.938 --> 00:64:50.148
scientists is these rather aloof individuals but who we can

1268
00:64:50.159 --> 00:64:53.579
trust. Trust me. It's the science, it's

1269
00:64:53.590 --> 00:64:55.619
not me saying it, it's the science that's saying

1270
00:64:55.628 --> 00:64:57.969
it. I am merely the, the kind of

1271
00:64:57.978 --> 00:65:00.688
priest through whom the science is channeled to you.

1272
00:65:00.909 --> 00:65:03.510
Uh So you have to believe it and yeah,

1273
00:65:03.519 --> 00:65:05.550
all sorts of things can go wrong there as we

1274
00:65:05.559 --> 00:65:10.719
know from every, every other aspect of our society

1275
00:65:10.918 --> 00:65:12.760
in, in, in almost any other aspect of

1276
00:65:12.769 --> 00:65:14.579
our society. If people came along and said,

1277
00:65:14.590 --> 00:65:15.679
you know, trust me, this, this,

1278
00:65:15.688 --> 00:65:16.079
this would be go yeah. Right. You know

1279
00:65:18.579 --> 00:65:21.179
. Yeah. A and we also have to get

1280
00:65:21.188 --> 00:65:26.519
a little bit more into that uh idea of trusting

1281
00:65:26.530 --> 00:65:30.179
the experts because uh I, I mean, knowing

1282
00:65:30.188 --> 00:65:34.679
what we know about how sometimes we should be careful

1283
00:65:34.688 --> 00:65:39.934
about trusting some published science. I mean, perhaps

1284
00:65:39.945 --> 00:65:41.864
we have to talk a little bit about how we

1285
00:65:41.875 --> 00:65:45.675
really should communicate that idea to the general public.

1286
00:65:45.684 --> 00:65:47.054
But uh before that, let me just ask you

1287
00:65:47.155 --> 00:65:50.614
a little bit more about the publishing system in science

1288
00:65:50.625 --> 00:65:54.469
. Do you think that uh there might be some

1289
00:65:54.478 --> 00:65:59.809
issues with it that also play a role in how

1290
00:65:59.820 --> 00:66:04.458
and why? Apparently there are so many bad studies

1291
00:66:04.469 --> 00:66:08.929
slash papers uh published. Yes, I mean,

1292
00:66:08.938 --> 00:66:13.500
it, the system is clearly nuts. In the

1293
00:66:13.510 --> 00:66:15.469
, in the late in the early 21st century,

1294
00:66:15.659 --> 00:66:18.349
you would never organize the system around that. What

1295
00:66:18.360 --> 00:66:21.789
we have is the result of 300 years, but

1296
00:66:21.800 --> 00:66:29.579
certainly 50 or 60 years of repeated kind of um

1297
00:66:29.590 --> 00:66:34.019
optimization of a process that suits the publishers and doesn't

1298
00:66:34.809 --> 00:66:39.728
and suits suits the individual scientists. It just doesn't

1299
00:66:39.739 --> 00:66:43.458
suit the interests of science. And there is um

1300
00:66:45.039 --> 00:66:48.099
there is a sort of growing realization that the people

1301
00:66:48.110 --> 00:66:51.728
who are successful are successful cos they published a lot

1302
00:66:51.739 --> 00:66:55.539
and therefore they're not gonna call into question the publishing

1303
00:66:55.550 --> 00:66:57.679
system. It did OK, by them, uh

1304
00:66:57.688 --> 00:66:59.820
the people who are criticizing it are the people who

1305
00:66:59.829 --> 00:67:00.280
haven't yet published a lot. And of course,

1306
00:67:00.289 --> 00:67:01.438
the people at the top would say, well,

1307
00:67:01.449 --> 00:67:03.469
you're just jealous, you just haven't published a lot

1308
00:67:03.478 --> 00:67:06.559
once you understand the system, you know, you'll

1309
00:67:06.570 --> 00:67:09.619
see that it's good for you. And of course

1310
00:67:09.679 --> 00:67:11.478
, the people who are selected to be at the

1311
00:67:11.489 --> 00:67:13.519
top are the people who published a lot. So

1312
00:67:13.530 --> 00:67:15.050
it's self reinforcing. I mean, it, it

1313
00:67:15.059 --> 00:67:17.889
actually means you can't tell one way or the other

1314
00:67:17.898 --> 00:67:20.820
, both sides are biased, both sides are biased

1315
00:67:20.829 --> 00:67:24.349
or have the potential to be biased. I personally

1316
00:67:24.360 --> 00:67:26.219
back the people who say that the system is,

1317
00:67:26.228 --> 00:67:29.119
is wrong, but we should acknowledge that the people

1318
00:67:29.128 --> 00:67:30.688
who are saying the system is wrong are by and

1319
00:67:30.699 --> 00:67:32.188
large, not the people who've been through the system

1320
00:67:32.570 --> 00:67:35.099
. And that, that doesn't prove that the people

1321
00:67:35.110 --> 00:67:38.000
who are saying that it's good because they've got to

1322
00:67:38.010 --> 00:67:41.878
the top um uh our, our role, but

1323
00:67:41.889 --> 00:67:44.110
we should, you know, consider that possibility that

1324
00:67:44.119 --> 00:67:46.800
they're there because they were successful at publishing. So

1325
00:67:46.829 --> 00:67:49.269
, um you would need to have a kind of

1326
00:67:49.280 --> 00:67:53.398
relatively neutral external party to say, you know,

1327
00:67:53.409 --> 00:67:55.469
is it a question of survivorship bias or is there

1328
00:67:55.478 --> 00:67:58.539
something something deeply wrong with the system? I,

1329
00:67:58.550 --> 00:68:00.708
I think it's fairly easy to make out the case

1330
00:68:00.719 --> 00:68:01.860
that there's something fairly wrong with the system. Uh

1331
00:68:01.869 --> 00:68:04.989
But um it's, it's, it's what we all

1332
00:68:05.000 --> 00:68:08.260
grew up with and there's nobody, you know,

1333
00:68:08.269 --> 00:68:11.139
there's nobody who remembers the time before it was about

1334
00:68:11.148 --> 00:68:15.958
journals and impact factors and um you know, other

1335
00:68:15.548 --> 00:68:19.949
stuff that you shouldn't be doing. So the publishing

1336
00:68:19.958 --> 00:68:24.668
system, we, we've we've, the, the

1337
00:68:24.680 --> 00:68:31.088
sort of administrative side of academia has piggybacked onto completely

1338
00:68:31.100 --> 00:68:35.220
contingent features of the public trading system such as uh

1339
00:68:35.770 --> 00:68:44.259
uh H index and citation counts. Um which somebody

1340
00:68:44.270 --> 00:68:45.180
came up with one day, you know, in

1341
00:68:45.189 --> 00:68:48.628
someone in 1963 wrote a paper saying, how about

1342
00:68:48.640 --> 00:68:50.409
we count someone's H index? And all of a

1343
00:68:50.418 --> 00:68:53.759
sudden the H index is all that counts as a

1344
00:68:53.770 --> 00:68:57.298
measure of your uh academic productivity. But we didn't

1345
00:68:57.310 --> 00:68:58.949
, we didn't have a commission, we didn't have

1346
00:68:58.958 --> 00:69:00.680
a sort of 15 year scientific commission to say what's

1347
00:69:00.689 --> 00:69:04.418
the best way to evaluate uh research because we were

1348
00:69:04.430 --> 00:69:06.390
in a hurry and we needed stuff doing now and

1349
00:69:06.399 --> 00:69:10.390
this was handy and we'll do that and now everyone's

1350
00:69:10.399 --> 00:69:13.529
and, and same with um impact factor journal,

1351
00:69:13.539 --> 00:69:16.430
impact Factor. And so journals now spend a great

1352
00:69:16.439 --> 00:69:19.109
deal of their time trying to manipulate their impact factor

1353
00:69:20.578 --> 00:69:24.850
. Uh So for example, what's very common and

1354
00:69:24.859 --> 00:69:26.579
some publishers do it more than others, but it's

1355
00:69:26.588 --> 00:69:30.859
common is that an article will be published uh online

1356
00:69:30.869 --> 00:69:33.750
first and then it won't appear in the paper if

1357
00:69:33.759 --> 00:69:35.439
there is a paper, but it won't get proper

1358
00:69:35.449 --> 00:69:40.289
page numbers and a volume number uh for 18 months

1359
00:69:41.099 --> 00:69:43.358
. And the reason for that is that the impact

1360
00:69:43.368 --> 00:69:46.158
factor is measured for the five years after official publication

1361
00:69:47.019 --> 00:69:49.078
. So they want to hit the ground running.

1362
00:69:49.488 --> 00:69:51.479
And of course, it's very difficult for a paper

1363
00:69:51.488 --> 00:69:58.579
to get cited in the first. Um No,

1364
00:69:58.588 --> 00:70:00.180
I just, if Zoom has just seen me put

1365
00:70:00.189 --> 00:70:03.079
my hand up, yeah, I, I,

1366
00:70:03.088 --> 00:70:05.869
that, that's C I for you, I guess

1367
00:70:08.229 --> 00:70:11.918
. Um but yeah, so um what was I

1368
00:70:11.930 --> 00:70:14.869
saying? Yeah, so um obviously when your paper

1369
00:70:14.878 --> 00:70:16.270
appears it's not gonna be cited the next month because

1370
00:70:16.279 --> 00:70:18.168
anything that might cite it has to be written and

1371
00:70:18.180 --> 00:70:20.220
has to go through the pipeline. And so a

1372
00:70:20.229 --> 00:70:23.109
lot of journals now, for example, are,

1373
00:70:23.119 --> 00:70:25.600
yeah, not publishing, not putting an official publication

1374
00:70:25.609 --> 00:70:28.509
date and page number on an article for 18 months

1375
00:70:28.560 --> 00:70:31.119
. So that the moment that the clock starts,

1376
00:70:31.338 --> 00:70:33.838
they hit the ground running and they get kind of

1377
00:70:33.850 --> 00:70:38.699
impact factor juice out of that publication uh from the

1378
00:70:38.708 --> 00:70:40.680
start. And there are various other ways in which

1379
00:70:40.689 --> 00:70:45.619
the publishers uh um game, the impact factor and

1380
00:70:45.628 --> 00:70:48.149
we all know it's being game but nobody does anything

1381
00:70:48.159 --> 00:70:50.939
about it partly because there isn't really anyone to do

1382
00:70:50.949 --> 00:70:55.750
anything about it. So um science is not like

1383
00:70:55.759 --> 00:70:58.779
the Catholic church, you know, with a guy

1384
00:70:58.789 --> 00:71:00.930
at the top who can sort of say as of

1385
00:71:00.939 --> 00:71:03.668
tomorrow, this happens. Science is much more like

1386
00:71:03.680 --> 00:71:09.100
um uh Sunni Islam, you know, very,

1387
00:71:09.109 --> 00:71:13.409
very, very distributed, no hierarchy, no kind

1388
00:71:13.418 --> 00:71:15.619
of, you know, great hierarchy of the,

1389
00:71:15.628 --> 00:71:17.229
of, of the priesthood. I apologize to any

1390
00:71:17.250 --> 00:71:19.409
Sunni Muslims watching this. But the impression I have

1391
00:71:19.418 --> 00:71:23.918
is that Sunni in particular is extremely decentralized. And

1392
00:71:23.930 --> 00:71:26.479
so there isn't even anybody who could decide to do

1393
00:71:26.489 --> 00:71:28.520
this. And when you see people on Twitter saying

1394
00:71:28.529 --> 00:71:30.918
, well, we should do this. It's like

1395
00:71:30.930 --> 00:71:33.489
, well, you can't because the, you know

1396
00:71:33.500 --> 00:71:35.520
, the only people who could decide to do that

1397
00:71:35.529 --> 00:71:39.168
are the publishers and they will decide what's in the

1398
00:71:39.180 --> 00:71:41.489
interests of their shareholders by and large. Those that

1399
00:71:41.500 --> 00:71:44.048
are run for profit. And the funny, the

1400
00:71:44.060 --> 00:71:45.069
, the kind of tragic thing is even publishers that

1401
00:71:45.079 --> 00:71:47.109
aren't run for profit tend to behave as if they

1402
00:71:47.119 --> 00:71:50.298
are. So, for example, the American Psychological

1403
00:71:50.310 --> 00:71:53.859
Association is, is really one of the worst offenders

1404
00:71:53.869 --> 00:71:56.359
in many publishing practices, even though in theory,

1405
00:71:56.369 --> 00:71:58.649
it only works for the benefit of its members.

1406
00:72:00.560 --> 00:72:01.918
But, but I mean, uh uh related to

1407
00:72:01.930 --> 00:72:05.239
that, how is it? I want to ask

1408
00:72:05.250 --> 00:72:09.319
you this question because I mean, particularly for people

1409
00:72:09.329 --> 00:72:14.020
who are not associated with academia or have academia related

1410
00:72:14.029 --> 00:72:17.168
occupations, perhaps, sometimes it might feel very hard

1411
00:72:17.180 --> 00:72:20.458
to understand how this happens. But how is it

1412
00:72:20.470 --> 00:72:29.819
that so much bad science sometimes go unchecked for so

1413
00:72:29.829 --> 00:72:32.000
long because, well, first of all, so

1414
00:72:32.009 --> 00:72:34.100
much gets published, I mean, we, we

1415
00:72:34.109 --> 00:72:41.759
publish 234 orders of magnitude more science than we can

1416
00:72:41.770 --> 00:72:46.930
consume as, as scientists. Um, you have

1417
00:72:46.939 --> 00:72:49.088
a, if you work in a department, you

1418
00:72:49.100 --> 00:72:51.819
work in the psychology department at a large university and

1419
00:72:51.829 --> 00:72:55.958
you're coming in the morning and read your calling.

1420
00:72:55.970 --> 00:72:57.489
Oh, my paper got accepted. Oh, they'll

1421
00:72:57.500 --> 00:73:00.909
say congratulations. They won't read it, they haven't

1422
00:73:00.918 --> 00:73:04.918
got time. So there's this absolute fire hose of

1423
00:73:04.930 --> 00:73:10.399
publications coming at us and almost nobody will ever read

1424
00:73:10.409 --> 00:73:14.509
any of them. Um, so that's the,

1425
00:73:14.520 --> 00:73:16.159
the, we, we're just publishing way too much

1426
00:73:16.319 --> 00:73:18.649
. So, nobody who's likely to have a,

1427
00:73:18.659 --> 00:73:21.088
a particularly critical opinion is likely to read your paper

1428
00:73:21.100 --> 00:73:23.720
. Now, if you're in a very small area

1429
00:73:24.970 --> 00:73:26.930
then maybe they will. And if it's a,

1430
00:73:26.939 --> 00:73:30.109
you know, small but, uh, important area

1431
00:73:30.119 --> 00:73:31.750
, but then you're gonna read that through the lens

1432
00:73:31.759 --> 00:73:34.149
probably of your professional jealousies of the author anyway.

1433
00:73:34.909 --> 00:73:38.640
So that's another. But by and large, it's

1434
00:73:38.649 --> 00:73:40.649
because we publish too much, we just publish way

1435
00:73:40.659 --> 00:73:42.798
, way, way too much. And so,

1436
00:73:43.009 --> 00:73:44.878
OK, there's this paper, it says that this

1437
00:73:44.890 --> 00:73:46.378
modulates the imp implement of this on this. Oh

1438
00:73:46.399 --> 00:73:48.779
, ok. If I'm working in that I might

1439
00:73:48.789 --> 00:73:51.750
find it. But it's quite often you won't find

1440
00:73:51.759 --> 00:73:55.798
that you won't cite that paper because you remember reading

1441
00:73:55.810 --> 00:73:57.970
it, you'll cite that paper cos you'll be looking

1442
00:73:57.979 --> 00:74:00.609
for some support for your argument in your literature review

1443
00:74:00.619 --> 00:74:01.509
and you'll Google it and you'll read the abstract.

1444
00:74:02.100 --> 00:74:04.168
But one of the things that happens certainly happens a

1445
00:74:04.180 --> 00:74:09.119
lot with my papers is when I read papers that

1446
00:74:09.128 --> 00:74:12.039
cite what I've written in a, a third or

1447
00:74:12.048 --> 00:74:14.609
more of the cases. They actually think it says

1448
00:74:14.619 --> 00:74:16.350
the opposite of what I said, cos they haven't

1449
00:74:16.359 --> 00:74:18.430
read or understood it. They've just kind of,

1450
00:74:18.729 --> 00:74:20.189
you know, oh, we sh we should,

1451
00:74:20.199 --> 00:74:23.329
we should cite something to say. X and say

1452
00:74:23.338 --> 00:74:25.500
, yeah, I think that Nick Brown guy had

1453
00:74:25.509 --> 00:74:27.949
a paper that did it and they'll go to Google

1454
00:74:27.958 --> 00:74:30.350
Scholar and they'll look at the titles and they'll click

1455
00:74:30.359 --> 00:74:31.289
on something and they'll read the abstract and go,

1456
00:74:31.298 --> 00:74:34.390
yeah. Good enough Brown and whatever. 2015.

1457
00:74:34.649 --> 00:74:38.270
And they're either citing the wrong paper or they haven't

1458
00:74:38.279 --> 00:74:41.140
read, you know, they haven't read it or

1459
00:74:41.149 --> 00:74:43.100
they've missed the word not out or something. And

1460
00:74:43.109 --> 00:74:45.899
, and, and so it's, it's just being

1461
00:74:45.909 --> 00:74:50.199
produced in French. We say a la loche by

1462
00:74:50.208 --> 00:74:55.369
the bucket load, by the bucket load. And

1463
00:74:55.770 --> 00:74:58.479
when you produce stuff by the bucket load, that's

1464
00:74:58.489 --> 00:75:02.289
what happens. You know, you can't produce masterpieces

1465
00:75:02.720 --> 00:75:05.439
uh on a, on a production line. So

1466
00:75:05.449 --> 00:75:08.770
really, it starts with the fact that we're producing

1467
00:75:08.779 --> 00:75:11.958
way too much science. But what happened was 1945

1468
00:75:11.970 --> 00:75:13.680
we'd won World War Two or the Americans, you

1469
00:75:13.689 --> 00:75:15.369
know, we won World War two with science.

1470
00:75:15.378 --> 00:75:17.489
Science is good. Therefore more science is better.

1471
00:75:17.970 --> 00:75:21.850
And um, you know, even today, it's

1472
00:75:21.859 --> 00:75:27.298
quite hard for even the most kind of pro maga

1473
00:75:27.418 --> 00:75:30.289
people to suggest cutting the science budget. Uh But

1474
00:75:30.298 --> 00:75:31.899
if you know, if, if, if uh

1475
00:75:32.378 --> 00:75:34.529
next year you get President Trump and he decides to

1476
00:75:34.539 --> 00:75:36.779
cut the science budget by 90% I'm gonna be hard

1477
00:75:36.789 --> 00:75:39.909
pushed, I'm gonna be hard pushed to tell you

1478
00:75:39.918 --> 00:75:45.798
why he shouldn't because I think we have 1020 times

1479
00:75:45.810 --> 00:75:49.770
too many people doing science to be able to do

1480
00:75:49.779 --> 00:75:54.770
anything useful. We've got enormous numbers of people doing

1481
00:75:54.779 --> 00:75:57.479
kind of science. Busy work. I don't know

1482
00:75:57.489 --> 00:75:58.829
if you know the term busy work. It's,

1483
00:75:58.838 --> 00:76:00.939
it's, it's w when you're a kindergarten teacher it's

1484
00:76:00.949 --> 00:76:01.789
what you do to keep the kids quiet and do

1485
00:76:01.798 --> 00:76:04.259
some cutting out, do some painting, you know

1486
00:76:04.270 --> 00:76:06.279
, fill up some time. Um, and we

1487
00:76:06.289 --> 00:76:09.500
, we've got people doing enormous amounts of science,

1488
00:76:09.509 --> 00:76:11.838
busy work. They're not going to discover anything.

1489
00:76:11.850 --> 00:76:14.279
They're not using methods that are going to discover anything

1490
00:76:14.779 --> 00:76:16.048
. We're sort of claiming that we're training them to

1491
00:76:16.060 --> 00:76:19.100
be scientists, but they're not, you know,

1492
00:76:19.109 --> 00:76:21.819
they're not making any worthwhile discoveries and they're not going

1493
00:76:21.829 --> 00:76:26.729
to make any worthwhile discoveries. And it's, again

1494
00:76:26.739 --> 00:76:28.378
, it's not a nice thing to say to people

1495
00:76:29.409 --> 00:76:30.189
. I, I do sometimes have this discussion with

1496
00:76:30.199 --> 00:76:32.270
my fellow scientists and to my, they don't push

1497
00:76:32.279 --> 00:76:34.109
back as much as I, as much as I

1498
00:76:34.119 --> 00:76:36.029
uh expect when I say, I think we need

1499
00:76:36.088 --> 00:76:40.378
to get rid of 90% of scientists. Um Most

1500
00:76:40.390 --> 00:76:42.020
of them seem to think they'll be in the remaining

1501
00:76:42.029 --> 00:76:45.899
10%. Uh maybe I have very talented uh friends

1502
00:76:45.909 --> 00:76:48.680
. But uh it, it, we are just

1503
00:76:48.689 --> 00:76:50.399
doing way, way, way too much. We're

1504
00:76:50.409 --> 00:76:53.770
doing way too much science and as a result,

1505
00:76:53.779 --> 00:76:55.298
there's lots of garbage. Now, if we got

1506
00:76:55.310 --> 00:76:56.359
rid of the problem is if we got rid of

1507
00:76:56.369 --> 00:76:58.680
90% we probably wouldn't get rid of the right 90%

1508
00:76:59.569 --> 00:77:01.930
because, you know, when you, when you

1509
00:77:01.939 --> 00:77:04.789
, when you do that kind of exercise people survive

1510
00:77:04.798 --> 00:77:08.779
on the basis of favoritism and friendships. And,

1511
00:77:09.909 --> 00:77:11.810
um, but yeah, I think we do have

1512
00:77:11.819 --> 00:77:15.208
to give some thought to doing less science heretical though

1513
00:77:15.220 --> 00:77:19.970
. That is a a and, but realistically speaking

1514
00:77:20.168 --> 00:77:24.759
, what would you say could be some solutions here

1515
00:77:24.770 --> 00:77:28.430
, particularly when it comes to publishing, to really

1516
00:77:28.439 --> 00:77:32.569
try to avoid as much as possible. Uh Bad

1517
00:77:32.579 --> 00:77:36.409
science getting published. Well, to start with.

1518
00:77:36.418 --> 00:77:42.529
Absolutely, every paper should present the full raw data

1519
00:77:42.859 --> 00:77:46.189
and the every computational step that was done to get

1520
00:77:46.199 --> 00:77:49.199
to the results and people sort of go oh,

1521
00:77:49.208 --> 00:77:53.779
but what about human subjects protection and in 99% of

1522
00:77:53.789 --> 00:77:58.100
cases in psychology, that's just an excuse. Um

1523
00:77:58.509 --> 00:78:01.449
You know, absolute you, yes, if you're

1524
00:78:01.458 --> 00:78:05.770
doing research among politic, you know, political dissidents

1525
00:78:05.779 --> 00:78:09.939
in some country and their lives are in danger or

1526
00:78:09.949 --> 00:78:14.640
if you're dealing with highly vulnerable people, then maybe

1527
00:78:14.649 --> 00:78:15.979
, then maybe, then we can talk about it

1528
00:78:15.989 --> 00:78:18.418
, then we can have specialized journals. But the

1529
00:78:18.430 --> 00:78:21.939
default ought to be, you show your raw data

1530
00:78:21.949 --> 00:78:26.819
as a minimum to the reviewers. There may be

1531
00:78:26.829 --> 00:78:30.579
data that you can't publish. But the idea that

1532
00:78:30.588 --> 00:78:32.539
you have data that is so sensitive that only you

1533
00:78:32.548 --> 00:78:35.600
are allowed to see it and not your peers who

1534
00:78:35.609 --> 00:78:40.479
are reviewing it is like, well, what qualifications

1535
00:78:40.489 --> 00:78:44.039
did you go through to make you able to see

1536
00:78:44.048 --> 00:78:46.168
those sensitive data. Why are you allowed to know

1537
00:78:46.180 --> 00:78:51.298
the names of these political dissidents are not your peers

1538
00:78:51.930 --> 00:78:55.509
who promised to keep it quiet? The medical profession

1539
00:78:55.520 --> 00:78:58.390
manages this. When I go for an X ray

1540
00:78:59.439 --> 00:79:00.088
, you know, and the, my doctor wants

1541
00:79:00.100 --> 00:79:01.979
a second opinion. He sends it through. He

1542
00:79:01.989 --> 00:79:03.329
doesn't go. Oh, yeah. No, I'm

1543
00:79:03.338 --> 00:79:05.899
not gonna send it through because that other doctor might

1544
00:79:05.909 --> 00:79:10.399
put your, you know, might put your genitals

1545
00:79:10.409 --> 00:79:13.458
on the internet or something. You know, there

1546
00:79:13.470 --> 00:79:17.579
are punishments for that. So we, I if

1547
00:79:17.588 --> 00:79:19.619
I join, if I might be your peer reviewer

1548
00:79:19.628 --> 00:79:21.199
and you won't let you see the data, but

1549
00:79:21.208 --> 00:79:24.378
you're hiring and if I join your lab tomorrow,

1550
00:79:24.390 --> 00:79:26.000
hey, I could, I could just open the

1551
00:79:26.009 --> 00:79:28.529
file. So, you know, it's not like

1552
00:79:28.539 --> 00:79:31.208
this is nuclear secrets. This is simply a question

1553
00:79:31.220 --> 00:79:34.168
of covering your arse a bit. Yes. Some

1554
00:79:34.180 --> 00:79:38.720
stuff is sensitive but you can get away with,

1555
00:79:38.729 --> 00:79:40.569
oh, it's sensitive and everyone has to go.

1556
00:79:40.579 --> 00:79:41.939
Oh, it's sensitive. OK. Right. And

1557
00:79:41.949 --> 00:79:44.180
nobody goes, no, it isn't. No,

1558
00:79:44.189 --> 00:79:46.298
that's just bullshit because we don't like going to people

1559
00:79:46.659 --> 00:79:48.918
who are telling bullshit stories and say sorry. That's

1560
00:79:48.930 --> 00:79:51.399
bullshit in the same way when people say, oh

1561
00:79:51.409 --> 00:79:54.220
yeah, I sorry, I don't have the data

1562
00:79:54.229 --> 00:79:57.708
. I accidentally wiped the hard drive with the only

1563
00:79:57.720 --> 00:80:00.029
copy of the data on it. Well, that

1564
00:80:00.039 --> 00:80:03.378
isn't true. Nobody accidentally wipes a hard drive and

1565
00:80:03.390 --> 00:80:06.890
nobody who is capable of wiping a hard drive is

1566
00:80:06.899 --> 00:80:11.449
not also fully aware that they need to make backups

1567
00:80:12.470 --> 00:80:14.759
. So, what do you do when somebody makes

1568
00:80:14.770 --> 00:80:18.418
a claim that is completely unreasonable and everyone's laughing at

1569
00:80:18.430 --> 00:80:20.640
them behind their back, but nobody actually stands up

1570
00:80:20.649 --> 00:80:24.789
and go, mate. Seriously. No, no

1571
00:80:24.798 --> 00:80:26.168
, that's bullshit. We go. All right.

1572
00:80:26.180 --> 00:80:27.759
Yes, we have to respect professors on this.

1573
00:80:27.779 --> 00:80:30.829
No. Sorry. The guy is being massively disingenuous

1574
00:80:30.838 --> 00:80:34.159
. He probably has something to hide. Let's,

1575
00:80:34.759 --> 00:80:36.409
uh, look further. But we don't do that

1576
00:80:36.418 --> 00:80:39.020
because it's, it's still at that level. A

1577
00:80:39.029 --> 00:80:43.619
gentleman's club. Um, science is very much a

1578
00:80:43.628 --> 00:80:46.939
gentleman's club because academia works that way. Um,

1579
00:80:46.949 --> 00:80:48.500
you know, how do you get a university to

1580
00:80:48.509 --> 00:80:51.449
investigate a senior professor when they, you know,

1581
00:80:51.600 --> 00:80:57.520
they're godfather to each other's kids or something? Um

1582
00:80:58.310 --> 00:81:00.369
, you know, it's, it's very difficult.

1583
00:81:00.378 --> 00:81:03.009
There's a reason why, for example, um,

1584
00:81:03.270 --> 00:81:08.640
law enforcement people tend not to have many friends outside

1585
00:81:08.649 --> 00:81:13.000
law enforcement and vice versa because if you have a

1586
00:81:13.009 --> 00:81:15.140
good friend who is a, you know, senior

1587
00:81:15.149 --> 00:81:19.239
detective, he knows that there's a chance one day

1588
00:81:19.250 --> 00:81:25.109
he may have to bust you. Yeah. Um

1589
00:81:25.310 --> 00:81:27.418
, you know, the police know how many people

1590
00:81:27.430 --> 00:81:30.430
there are out there committing offenses of various kinds and

1591
00:81:30.439 --> 00:81:33.829
it's an enormous number. Uh, I, I

1592
00:81:33.838 --> 00:81:35.390
saw a thing, I wish I had a source

1593
00:81:35.399 --> 00:81:40.430
for this about 25 years ago and it was one

1594
00:81:40.750 --> 00:81:43.029
, it was 10 million people in the UK.

1595
00:81:43.039 --> 00:81:48.750
So population 60,000,010 million people have a conviction for a

1596
00:81:48.759 --> 00:81:56.529
conviction for something that isn't a motoring offense. And

1597
00:81:56.539 --> 00:81:58.390
if you assume most of those are men, that's

1598
00:81:58.399 --> 00:82:01.000
about one men in three. So that one man

1599
00:82:01.009 --> 00:82:08.199
in three has been convicted in a court of law

1600
00:82:08.208 --> 00:82:11.310
now, probably something minor, probably just drunk and

1601
00:82:11.319 --> 00:82:13.289
disorderly or, you know, urinating in a public

1602
00:82:13.298 --> 00:82:15.628
place or whatever it is. Nonetheless, one man

1603
00:82:15.640 --> 00:82:19.390
in three in the UK. And I don't see

1604
00:82:19.399 --> 00:82:23.159
any obvious reason why it should be vastly less elsewhere

1605
00:82:23.168 --> 00:82:26.220
has some kind of. And so, you know

1606
00:82:26.229 --> 00:82:28.509
, when you're in law enforcement, you know that

1607
00:82:28.520 --> 00:82:30.739
there's, there's a, there's a chance, what

1608
00:82:30.750 --> 00:82:33.458
am I going to do one day if I have

1609
00:82:33.470 --> 00:82:40.869
suspicions that Ricardo is committing fraud. Uh And so

1610
00:82:41.909 --> 00:82:45.649
law enforcement tends to be done separately from the rest

1611
00:82:45.659 --> 00:82:47.088
of society and these people tend to exist. It's

1612
00:82:47.100 --> 00:82:49.708
one reason why people don't always trust police officers cos

1613
00:82:49.720 --> 00:82:50.989
we don't really know them, we don't get to

1614
00:82:51.000 --> 00:82:54.628
know them. So come back to academia all of

1615
00:82:54.640 --> 00:82:57.458
a sudden, Professor X is accused of something and

1616
00:82:57.470 --> 00:83:00.539
there's a committee consisting of professors A B and C

1617
00:83:00.680 --> 00:83:04.088
to investigate them. It's, it's very awkward for

1618
00:83:04.100 --> 00:83:11.168
everybody, very awkward for everybody. So the there

1619
00:83:11.180 --> 00:83:14.279
is no real method by which that can be investigated

1620
00:83:14.289 --> 00:83:18.819
because there's no police, there's no prosecutors and the

1621
00:83:18.829 --> 00:83:23.439
, the bad people know that they, when if

1622
00:83:23.449 --> 00:83:26.409
somebody says Blimey, how did you get that amazing

1623
00:83:26.418 --> 00:83:30.259
result? You know, you're not gonna go,

1624
00:83:30.270 --> 00:83:30.939
I made the data up. You're gonna come up

1625
00:83:30.949 --> 00:83:36.009
with some moderately bullshit excuse. But your colleague who

1626
00:83:36.020 --> 00:83:39.229
you've had coffee with every morning for the last five

1627
00:83:39.239 --> 00:83:42.859
years is not gonna go, Nick. That's just

1628
00:83:42.869 --> 00:83:45.899
bullshit. What's wrong with you? Because we don't

1629
00:83:45.909 --> 00:83:48.189
do that with our colleagues. We just don't,

1630
00:83:49.729 --> 00:83:53.458
I'm sure you've come across situations in journalism where people

1631
00:83:53.470 --> 00:83:56.869
have just made up stories. Mhm. You know

1632
00:83:56.878 --> 00:83:59.149
, how do you deal with that when you suspect

1633
00:83:59.159 --> 00:84:00.259
that this interview? Oh, wow, great interview

1634
00:84:00.270 --> 00:84:03.539
with the, with the defense minister. Wasn't,

1635
00:84:03.548 --> 00:84:08.779
wasn't he, wasn't he in Australia at the time

1636
00:84:09.739 --> 00:84:13.930
? Um Should I ask about that? I'll,

1637
00:84:13.939 --> 00:84:15.270
I'll, I'll just keep quiet, I'll wait for

1638
00:84:15.279 --> 00:84:18.958
more evidence. Um And, and we as,

1639
00:84:18.970 --> 00:84:24.798
as a society and a society of polite middle class

1640
00:84:24.810 --> 00:84:30.560
, educated individuals are not very good at calling out

1641
00:84:30.569 --> 00:84:32.239
situations where we go, hold on is, is

1642
00:84:32.250 --> 00:84:35.489
, is this just all lies cos it's not something

1643
00:84:35.500 --> 00:84:39.479
we, it's not something we're used to dealing with

1644
00:84:40.489 --> 00:84:42.529
. And, and so as a result, the

1645
00:84:42.539 --> 00:84:44.729
bad faith people can get away with a lot because

1646
00:84:44.739 --> 00:84:46.020
they just exploit the fact that nobody's ever gonna ask

1647
00:84:46.029 --> 00:84:50.239
them. And in many cases, these are people

1648
00:84:50.250 --> 00:84:55.039
who have been doing this since they were Children and

1649
00:84:55.048 --> 00:84:58.048
they quickly learned as a child that if you develop

1650
00:84:58.060 --> 00:85:03.720
the right kind of um obfuscated uh sta um strategies

1651
00:85:03.729 --> 00:85:08.708
to deflect attention uh that, that will work.

1652
00:85:08.720 --> 00:85:10.489
And I'm sure you know, you knew people like

1653
00:85:10.500 --> 00:85:12.119
this and, you know, people like this in

1654
00:85:12.128 --> 00:85:15.479
your life who've gone through their lives, they're not

1655
00:85:15.489 --> 00:85:19.770
quite what they seem but they're pretty good at hiding

1656
00:85:19.779 --> 00:85:23.789
it and you get them in every walk of life

1657
00:85:23.798 --> 00:85:27.640
and you get science. But, uh, I

1658
00:85:27.649 --> 00:85:29.560
, I mean, let me ask you then a

1659
00:85:29.569 --> 00:85:32.520
different kind of question. So do you think that

1660
00:85:32.529 --> 00:85:38.588
as individual readers of the scientific literature, I mean

1661
00:85:38.600 --> 00:85:42.878
, as people that are interested in science, that

1662
00:85:42.890 --> 00:85:46.918
we can really do much to avoid, at least

1663
00:85:46.930 --> 00:85:54.793
sometimes giving rhythm to some bad science. I mean

1664
00:85:54.805 --> 00:85:59.225
, because we went through some examples here today and

1665
00:85:59.574 --> 00:86:02.793
at least in one of them, you mentioned how

1666
00:86:02.805 --> 00:86:08.154
hard it was to go through the data and the

1667
00:86:08.164 --> 00:86:10.725
statistical analysis and all of that. I mean,

1668
00:86:10.895 --> 00:86:15.395
it shouldn't we expect that uh most people or even

1669
00:86:15.404 --> 00:86:20.739
all of us at least now and then uh will

1670
00:86:20.750 --> 00:86:26.399
give grievance to some bad science and intentionally. Yeah

1671
00:86:26.409 --> 00:86:28.220
. No, you, you can't, you can't

1672
00:86:29.369 --> 00:86:33.168
uh to a first approximation, you can't. Um

1673
00:86:33.180 --> 00:86:36.789
And if that results in staring into the abyss,

1674
00:86:36.798 --> 00:86:40.689
then welcome to the abyss. Uh you can't,

1675
00:86:41.250 --> 00:86:43.909
you have to trust something at some point. Uh

1676
00:86:43.918 --> 00:86:45.729
otherwise you end up being a total conspiracy crank.

1677
00:86:46.628 --> 00:86:53.869
Um And so um yeah, it, it,

1678
00:86:53.878 --> 00:86:55.668
it gets, it, it gets pretty dark,

1679
00:86:55.680 --> 00:86:57.668
it gets pretty dark in places because it's like,

1680
00:86:57.680 --> 00:87:00.048
well, why should I trust this vaccine? You

1681
00:87:00.060 --> 00:87:00.970
know, why should I believe that climate change is

1682
00:87:00.979 --> 00:87:03.819
real and you know, I, I trust vaccines

1683
00:87:03.829 --> 00:87:06.128
and I believe climate change is real, but um

1684
00:87:06.270 --> 00:87:12.128
science is not doing itself any favors by tolerating this

1685
00:87:12.140 --> 00:87:13.430
kind of behavior. So, I mean, one

1686
00:87:13.439 --> 00:87:14.930
of the things I was involved in, in,

1687
00:87:15.289 --> 00:87:18.109
from about two years ago, uh was somebody who

1688
00:87:18.119 --> 00:87:24.779
was faking climate related research. Um She was making

1689
00:87:24.789 --> 00:87:30.479
out that the effect of dissolved carbon dioxide increase in

1690
00:87:30.489 --> 00:87:32.850
dissolved carbon dioxide, increased ocean acidification, which is

1691
00:87:32.859 --> 00:87:35.779
a well known phenomenon. Uh And she was making

1692
00:87:35.789 --> 00:87:39.220
out that the effect it was having on fish was

1693
00:87:39.229 --> 00:87:44.168
absolutely catastrophic and she was making all of her data

1694
00:87:44.180 --> 00:87:47.109
up now, that doesn't mean that the effect might

1695
00:87:47.119 --> 00:87:51.329
not be catastrophic, but it hands ammunition on a

1696
00:87:51.338 --> 00:87:54.810
plate to people who say, who go, who

1697
00:87:54.819 --> 00:87:57.109
say climate change is a scam. It's all being

1698
00:87:57.119 --> 00:88:00.298
done by researchers for grant money because in this case

1699
00:88:00.310 --> 00:88:05.208
, it was now, uh that's kind of embarrassing

1700
00:88:05.220 --> 00:88:08.180
. I don't think she was typical and, and

1701
00:88:08.189 --> 00:88:10.310
, and she wasn't doing research into the actual kind

1702
00:88:10.319 --> 00:88:11.579
of climate science. It was the, you know

1703
00:88:11.588 --> 00:88:14.500
, the knock on effect, but it's true that

1704
00:88:14.509 --> 00:88:16.418
in, um, it's certainly true that in,

1705
00:88:16.430 --> 00:88:19.489
in most fields of, of animal biology, for

1706
00:88:19.500 --> 00:88:23.649
example, uh it's a lot easier to get your

1707
00:88:23.659 --> 00:88:26.458
research funded if you can chick tick the climate change

1708
00:88:26.470 --> 00:88:30.128
box. Yeah. So, uh you know,

1709
00:88:30.140 --> 00:88:33.609
we're, we're not doing ourselves any favors uh by

1710
00:88:33.668 --> 00:88:36.048
insisting on you know, everything has to be tied

1711
00:88:36.060 --> 00:88:39.189
to that. But I, I, yeah,

1712
00:88:39.199 --> 00:88:41.628
this and then this person came from a lab which

1713
00:88:41.640 --> 00:88:45.199
produces a whole load of dubious research. And I

1714
00:88:45.208 --> 00:88:45.548
think, I don't know whether people go in there

1715
00:88:45.560 --> 00:88:48.159
as honest citizens and come out believing that they're making

1716
00:88:48.168 --> 00:88:53.569
discoveries by fabricating the data. Maybe they get on

1717
00:88:53.579 --> 00:88:57.250
such a kind of mission on what is an extremely

1718
00:88:57.259 --> 00:89:00.680
important topic that they think it's OK to fake results

1719
00:89:00.689 --> 00:89:02.560
. Certainly the people who blew the whistle uh on

1720
00:89:02.569 --> 00:89:08.270
this individual are, you know, mainstream, mainstream

1721
00:89:08.279 --> 00:89:11.759
biologists concerned about the impact of climate change. But

1722
00:89:11.770 --> 00:89:15.338
they also say it's not doing anyone any favors to

1723
00:89:15.350 --> 00:89:19.759
exaggerate the the impact um or to to fake data

1724
00:89:19.770 --> 00:89:24.449
about it. So in terms of trust in science

1725
00:89:24.458 --> 00:89:27.770
, yeah, for exa another example is III I

1726
00:89:27.779 --> 00:89:30.199
worked with some people on various fake COVID cures and

1727
00:89:30.208 --> 00:89:32.548
those are relatively easy to debunk because most of the

1728
00:89:32.560 --> 00:89:36.088
studies claiming, you know, most of the trials

1729
00:89:36.100 --> 00:89:39.418
claimed to have been done never took place and the

1730
00:89:39.430 --> 00:89:42.119
data were fake. But the same per one of

1731
00:89:42.128 --> 00:89:44.770
the people who was I was helping with that has

1732
00:89:44.779 --> 00:89:48.220
discovered that pfizer still hasn't released one of their uh

1733
00:89:48.229 --> 00:89:50.168
chunks of trial data that they should have done.

1734
00:89:51.399 --> 00:89:54.770
You know, I had my Pfizer jab yesterday,

1735
00:89:54.779 --> 00:89:57.850
I have reasonable faith. You know, I had

1736
00:89:57.859 --> 00:89:59.509
COVID, I didn't get as ill as I probably

1737
00:89:59.520 --> 00:90:00.208
could have done if I hadn't had the jab,

1738
00:90:00.220 --> 00:90:03.128
but they still haven't released those data. Come on

1739
00:90:03.390 --> 00:90:08.878
, come on, you know, um you know

1740
00:90:10.229 --> 00:90:13.539
, uh so there, you know, there is

1741
00:90:13.548 --> 00:90:17.020
bad behavior at all the levels, I suppose after

1742
00:90:17.029 --> 00:90:18.399
a while, it just becomes a question of the

1743
00:90:18.409 --> 00:90:24.958
overwhelming consensus. Um and particularly in reproducible sciences,

1744
00:90:25.310 --> 00:90:27.350
then you kind of look at the consensus. So

1745
00:90:27.359 --> 00:90:30.899
if someone produces a bad uh a bad paper on

1746
00:90:30.909 --> 00:90:32.479
, on superconductors, for example, there's always something

1747
00:90:32.489 --> 00:90:35.979
about superconductors. Um you'll know within three months,

1748
00:90:35.989 --> 00:90:38.789
if it's real cos somebody will go and try and

1749
00:90:38.798 --> 00:90:41.789
make the same, you know, compound and it'll

1750
00:90:41.798 --> 00:90:44.140
either work or it won't and that will get dropped

1751
00:90:44.149 --> 00:90:46.850
very quickly in psychology because the concepts are all so

1752
00:90:46.859 --> 00:90:50.229
kind of malleable. Uh You can always plead that

1753
00:90:50.239 --> 00:90:54.319
they weren't really testing what you thought, what they

1754
00:90:54.329 --> 00:90:58.310
thought they were testing and you can eventually the line

1755
00:90:58.319 --> 00:91:00.810
of research will collapse. But by then you'll have

1756
00:91:00.819 --> 00:91:01.869
retired, you'll have got the best selling book,

1757
00:91:01.878 --> 00:91:04.250
15 years will have gone by and nobody will care

1758
00:91:05.489 --> 00:91:08.949
. So it's, it's much easier to um to

1759
00:91:08.958 --> 00:91:11.298
get away with that kind of thing in, in

1760
00:91:11.310 --> 00:91:14.338
a, in psychology. And then in, in

1761
00:91:14.350 --> 00:91:16.588
, in basic biology research, the problem is that

1762
00:91:16.600 --> 00:91:19.529
there's so many diseases and so many genes that anyone

1763
00:91:19.539 --> 00:91:21.628
, a lot of these fake papers that are written

1764
00:91:21.640 --> 00:91:24.250
to order you just pick a gene, pick a

1765
00:91:24.259 --> 00:91:27.509
disease and someone will write a story saying the two

1766
00:91:27.520 --> 00:91:30.699
are linked with experiments that never took place, but

1767
00:91:30.708 --> 00:91:32.520
it's very formulaic and no one will ever test that

1768
00:91:32.529 --> 00:91:34.899
because the chances are that nobody's looking at that gene

1769
00:91:34.909 --> 00:91:39.779
for that disease every so often somebody might come along

1770
00:91:39.789 --> 00:91:40.979
and say, oh, I was interested, oh

1771
00:91:40.989 --> 00:91:43.039
, and, and I got misled by this fake

1772
00:91:43.048 --> 00:91:45.680
paper. But the, these fake papers mostly are

1773
00:91:45.689 --> 00:91:48.259
just bulking out the journals and bulking up the university's

1774
00:91:48.270 --> 00:91:51.060
kind of count of how much prestigious research we're doing

1775
00:91:51.250 --> 00:91:54.020
. But there isn't even a great danger of them

1776
00:91:54.029 --> 00:91:57.560
causing too much individually causing too much problem because nobody's

1777
00:91:57.569 --> 00:92:00.378
even gonna read them. Yeah. And, and

1778
00:92:00.390 --> 00:92:01.270
, and you get this rather kind of ca care

1779
00:92:01.279 --> 00:92:04.699
situation of, of, um, I call them

1780
00:92:04.708 --> 00:92:08.720
, write only papers, you know, they,

1781
00:92:08.729 --> 00:92:11.319
they, they're only ever written and published and nobody

1782
00:92:11.329 --> 00:92:15.668
ever reads them but somebody somewhere has an economic interest

1783
00:92:15.680 --> 00:92:17.579
in doing that. I don't know if you ever

1784
00:92:17.588 --> 00:92:20.439
Google, sometimes you Google for a phrase and there's

1785
00:92:20.449 --> 00:92:25.298
this page on the internet of complete gibberish that's been

1786
00:92:25.310 --> 00:92:28.859
copied and pasted from 25 different and maybe translated into

1787
00:92:28.869 --> 00:92:30.439
Albanian and back to English. And you go,

1788
00:92:30.449 --> 00:92:32.279
what even is this page doing? And there aren't

1789
00:92:32.289 --> 00:92:38.409
any adverts on there but there's somebody somewhere has identified

1790
00:92:38.418 --> 00:92:40.859
that there's a very small economic benefit to doing that

1791
00:92:41.279 --> 00:92:42.418
. And, and uh yeah, it, it

1792
00:92:42.430 --> 00:92:43.789
, it, it's like that a lot of,

1793
00:92:43.798 --> 00:92:48.869
a lot of what's called scientific publication is just very

1794
00:92:48.878 --> 00:92:53.529
, very marginal economic benefits. From somebody and that

1795
00:92:53.539 --> 00:92:56.869
appears to have no impact on anyone else. You

1796
00:92:56.878 --> 00:92:59.109
know, who is the victim, who is the

1797
00:92:59.119 --> 00:93:01.350
victim. If I publish a scientific paper about research

1798
00:93:01.359 --> 00:93:06.569
that never took place on a gene disease link that

1799
00:93:06.579 --> 00:93:11.759
no one else is interested in investigating who's the,

1800
00:93:11.770 --> 00:93:15.708
who's the victim? Yeah, it's, it's difficult

1801
00:93:15.720 --> 00:93:19.298
. It, how would you ever prosecute that on

1802
00:93:19.310 --> 00:93:25.270
what basis would you try to discipline somebody? And

1803
00:93:25.409 --> 00:93:27.909
if you only discover it three years later and they've

1804
00:93:27.918 --> 00:93:30.838
moved on to another university, the university where they

1805
00:93:30.850 --> 00:93:32.770
were at the time says, well, they left

1806
00:93:33.000 --> 00:93:34.810
the university where they are now, will say,

1807
00:93:34.819 --> 00:93:38.199
hey, it wasn't done at our university and,

1808
00:93:38.208 --> 00:93:40.208
and um a lot of fraudulent people, if you

1809
00:93:40.220 --> 00:93:42.359
, if you move every three years, you'll,

1810
00:93:42.369 --> 00:93:45.159
you, you'll essentially never get formally sanctioned for any

1811
00:93:45.168 --> 00:93:50.399
form of malpractice because your current university will never investigate

1812
00:93:50.409 --> 00:93:54.418
you for stuff at another place. And your previous

1813
00:93:54.430 --> 00:93:57.649
place says, hey, they moved on. That's

1814
00:93:57.659 --> 00:93:59.109
, uh you know, if you imagine, imagine

1815
00:93:59.119 --> 00:94:00.909
if you could commit actual kind of financial fraud by

1816
00:94:00.918 --> 00:94:03.259
moving on to a different bank every three years.

1817
00:94:05.939 --> 00:94:09.430
Well, but uh I mean, related to that

1818
00:94:09.439 --> 00:94:13.918
when it comes to the idea that we communicate to

1819
00:94:13.930 --> 00:94:15.060
people, and I, I still think it's a

1820
00:94:15.069 --> 00:94:18.119
good idea of course, when we tell people that

1821
00:94:18.128 --> 00:94:21.069
they should trust the experts. Uh and, and

1822
00:94:21.079 --> 00:94:24.689
I mean, we really do need to trust the

1823
00:94:24.699 --> 00:94:30.140
experts because realistically speaking, we cannot evaluate data from

1824
00:94:30.149 --> 00:94:33.229
all sorts of places by ourselves. I mean,

1825
00:94:33.239 --> 00:94:39.909
that's impossible. But uh but, but since there's

1826
00:94:39.918 --> 00:94:44.369
still some bad science, some fraudulent science, I

1827
00:94:44.378 --> 00:94:48.289
mean, sometimes I'm afraid that if we just say

1828
00:94:48.350 --> 00:94:55.208
without adding anything to it without adding any warnings or

1829
00:94:55.220 --> 00:95:00.470
nuance with uh trustee experts, then if sometimes it

1830
00:95:00.479 --> 00:95:03.909
happens that people know that all this piece of science

1831
00:95:03.918 --> 00:95:08.319
, this piece of research got published and then five

1832
00:95:08.329 --> 00:95:11.784
years later, it was discovered that it was just

1833
00:95:12.134 --> 00:95:15.145
pure fraud or something like that, that people might

1834
00:95:15.154 --> 00:95:18.324
get cynical and think, oh, ok, if

1835
00:95:18.333 --> 00:95:21.333
it works like that, then uh I will just

1836
00:95:21.345 --> 00:95:26.664
go like this. If it confirms my pre-existing beliefs

1837
00:95:26.673 --> 00:95:30.225
, then I will trust the experts if it doesn't

1838
00:95:30.588 --> 00:95:32.918
to hell with it. So, you know,

1839
00:95:32.930 --> 00:95:38.009
so how should we handle it? Well, I

1840
00:95:38.020 --> 00:95:40.168
I there's not much you can do about what people

1841
00:95:40.259 --> 00:95:42.890
, what people out there want to believe. Uh

1842
00:95:42.899 --> 00:95:44.930
I think the, the issue is when it starts

1843
00:95:44.939 --> 00:95:47.208
affecting public policy. Um and, and we,

1844
00:95:47.220 --> 00:95:48.289
you know, you, when you, when you

1845
00:95:48.298 --> 00:95:50.899
see the kind of Q and on crazies, uh

1846
00:95:50.909 --> 00:95:55.458
finding themselves actually getting elected to congress, et cetera

1847
00:95:55.470 --> 00:95:56.699
. Um And you know, there are one or

1848
00:95:56.708 --> 00:96:00.430
two an rabidly anti vax members of parliament in the

1849
00:96:00.439 --> 00:96:05.298
UK. Um But um by and large, I

1850
00:96:05.310 --> 00:96:08.000
think you have to sort of hope for the wisdom

1851
00:96:08.009 --> 00:96:10.458
of the, of the majority. I think also

1852
00:96:10.720 --> 00:96:13.539
the majority of scientific fraud. Is in areas that

1853
00:96:13.548 --> 00:96:16.939
people don't really care about. Uh It's not taking

1854
00:96:16.949 --> 00:96:20.489
place in, in uh the most basic stuff that

1855
00:96:20.500 --> 00:96:24.449
can be replicated easily and which turns into technology,

1856
00:96:24.458 --> 00:96:28.588
whether that's medical technology, uh or, um,

1857
00:96:29.520 --> 00:96:33.079
or, or computer technology that said, I think

1858
00:96:33.088 --> 00:96:38.409
there is a, we are approaching a point where

1859
00:96:38.418 --> 00:96:42.199
, for example, a lot of drug development is

1860
00:96:42.208 --> 00:96:50.220
now on drugs that have moderate effects at best and

1861
00:96:51.659 --> 00:96:56.140
whether or not those effects are real and how will

1862
00:96:56.149 --> 00:96:59.168
we discover if they're not? Um, so,

1863
00:96:59.560 --> 00:97:01.850
you know, nobody's going to doubt the effect of

1864
00:97:01.859 --> 00:97:04.708
penicillin, for example, but if you have a

1865
00:97:04.720 --> 00:97:06.609
new disea, uh if you have a new drug

1866
00:97:06.619 --> 00:97:09.310
for, I mean, talk about Alzheimer's, which

1867
00:97:09.319 --> 00:97:10.850
is in the news at the moment with two or

1868
00:97:10.859 --> 00:97:14.640
three stories of, of various forms of either historical

1869
00:97:14.649 --> 00:97:19.529
or current fraudulent research. How do you know that

1870
00:97:19.539 --> 00:97:25.399
an Alzheimer's drug is working? And how do you

1871
00:97:25.409 --> 00:97:30.000
know that it's working when it claims when the only

1872
00:97:30.009 --> 00:97:32.569
claim their claim is not, you know, Alzheimer's

1873
00:97:32.579 --> 00:97:34.958
will go away, you know, your, your

1874
00:97:35.020 --> 00:97:38.588
, your grandmother is going to be, you know

1875
00:97:38.600 --> 00:97:42.689
, playing chess at national level in three years time

1876
00:97:43.119 --> 00:97:47.168
. Um When the claim is that it makes significant

1877
00:97:47.180 --> 00:97:53.378
difference to the severity of symptoms. Uh, how

1878
00:97:53.390 --> 00:97:57.239
are you going to test that? Because these things

1879
00:97:57.250 --> 00:97:59.918
are all based on samples and averages and there's always

1880
00:97:59.930 --> 00:98:01.659
gonna be people for whom it doesn't work. We've

1881
00:98:01.668 --> 00:98:08.039
got used to having medicines that have relatively dramatic effects

1882
00:98:08.048 --> 00:98:09.850
. You know, we bring in a measles vaccine

1883
00:98:09.859 --> 00:98:11.418
and all of a sudden the number of measles cases

1884
00:98:11.430 --> 00:98:13.000
goes from that down to here. I mean,

1885
00:98:13.009 --> 00:98:17.208
you can, um, it's, it's quite easy

1886
00:98:17.220 --> 00:98:20.609
to hide poor science if your claim is fairly modest

1887
00:98:21.939 --> 00:98:25.319
. Now, normally, when claims are fairly modest

1888
00:98:25.329 --> 00:98:29.819
, they don't then become that important. So obvious

1889
00:98:29.829 --> 00:98:30.829
you get things in psychology and, you know,

1890
00:98:30.838 --> 00:98:33.458
we're going to reduce your back depression inventory score from

1891
00:98:33.470 --> 00:98:36.619
4.2 and 3.8. But people aren't rushing out to

1892
00:98:36.628 --> 00:98:39.520
change public policy on that basis. You know,

1893
00:98:39.529 --> 00:98:41.390
maybe one or two people are going to an expensive

1894
00:98:41.399 --> 00:98:43.958
training course they didn't need. But if you come

1895
00:98:43.970 --> 00:98:45.668
along and say we, you know, we're going

1896
00:98:45.680 --> 00:98:50.100
to reduce Alzheimer's symptoms, we're going to delay the

1897
00:98:50.109 --> 00:98:58.390
onset of dependency by 18 months on average. And

1898
00:98:58.399 --> 00:99:00.350
people are reading about this, this new drug and

1899
00:99:00.359 --> 00:99:03.628
you're going well, my mum, my dad is

1900
00:99:04.159 --> 00:99:10.039
an early stage Alzheimer's if we could have 18 months

1901
00:99:10.048 --> 00:99:13.899
more with them before, you know, these things

1902
00:99:13.909 --> 00:99:15.989
are fairly inevitable. But before the decline, how

1903
00:99:16.000 --> 00:99:18.020
much would you pay for that? Or how much

1904
00:99:18.029 --> 00:99:20.159
would you in a European context? You know,

1905
00:99:20.168 --> 00:99:24.628
demand that your health system pays for that rather than

1906
00:99:25.180 --> 00:99:27.259
shingles vaccine. I have to go for a shingles

1907
00:99:27.270 --> 00:99:32.850
vaccine tomorrow and it's expensive. Um And how would

1908
00:99:32.859 --> 00:99:35.609
we know if it was or wasn't having an effect

1909
00:99:36.418 --> 00:99:39.259
? And it's really quite difficult because, you know

1910
00:99:39.270 --> 00:99:42.838
, we do that on the basis of observation report

1911
00:99:42.850 --> 00:99:45.119
of the statistics and those kind of, that kind

1912
00:99:45.128 --> 00:99:46.560
of research is quite, is quite easy to falsify

1913
00:99:47.439 --> 00:99:50.739
. So I think that is historically, it's not

1914
00:99:50.750 --> 00:99:53.909
been too much of a problem because the kind of

1915
00:99:53.918 --> 00:99:56.259
gee whiz claims that have turned out to be false

1916
00:99:56.270 --> 00:99:59.439
, the kind of Cyril Burt, uh, things

1917
00:99:59.449 --> 00:100:01.418
, the, I think psychology stuff, um,

1918
00:100:01.588 --> 00:100:03.949
has tended to be fairly fluffy stuff. But with

1919
00:100:03.958 --> 00:100:08.338
one or two exceptions, uh with things like the

1920
00:100:08.350 --> 00:100:11.128
nudging and the, you know, signing the paper

1921
00:100:11.140 --> 00:100:13.140
at the top to say you'll be honest, one

1922
00:100:13.149 --> 00:100:14.949
or two, but it hasn't really had a huge

1923
00:100:14.958 --> 00:100:16.720
impact. But the, the medical stuff I'm starting

1924
00:100:16.729 --> 00:100:19.720
to worry about now because the claims are no longer

1925
00:100:19.729 --> 00:100:21.560
, you take one of these pills, it costs

1926
00:100:21.569 --> 00:100:24.770
$3 and, and, you know, it will

1927
00:100:24.779 --> 00:100:26.378
go away. We will know we, we,

1928
00:100:26.390 --> 00:100:30.060
the, I, they're talking now about malaria vaccines

1929
00:100:30.069 --> 00:100:32.560
that are 50 or 60% efficient and can be made

1930
00:100:32.569 --> 00:100:35.350
for, I don't know, 20$30. If

1931
00:100:35.359 --> 00:100:39.560
we deploy several, tens of millions of those,

1932
00:100:39.569 --> 00:100:42.409
we will see, we will see in the figures

1933
00:100:42.418 --> 00:100:44.989
that there is that much less malaria and we will

1934
00:100:45.000 --> 00:100:48.390
know that they work um, some of these other

1935
00:100:48.399 --> 00:100:53.958
drugs that, you know, with modest claim effects

1936
00:100:53.970 --> 00:100:55.628
, how are we gonna know if they're working or

1937
00:100:55.640 --> 00:100:58.310
not? It, it's very difficult because the,

1938
00:100:58.319 --> 00:101:00.918
you know, the whole initial claim is difficult to

1939
00:101:00.930 --> 00:101:03.909
evaluate uh uh uh a percentage drop of this,

1940
00:101:04.048 --> 00:101:06.250
you know, with what statistical techniques. And even

1941
00:101:06.259 --> 00:101:09.109
if the research is being done, honestly, people

1942
00:101:09.119 --> 00:101:11.509
don't always agree about the right way to analyze these

1943
00:101:11.520 --> 00:101:15.039
things. So yeah, historically, it was I

1944
00:101:15.048 --> 00:101:16.399
think simpler because you make, you know, you

1945
00:101:16.409 --> 00:101:20.079
claim you made a superconductor, nobody needs to worry

1946
00:101:20.088 --> 00:101:21.878
about that because in three months time, we'll either

1947
00:101:21.890 --> 00:101:25.159
know if it works or if it doesn't. Uh

1948
00:101:25.168 --> 00:101:27.208
But if you play some of the, some of

1949
00:101:27.220 --> 00:101:28.838
the stuff in, in the medical area is,

1950
00:101:28.850 --> 00:101:30.509
is and we know we know that plenty of drugs

1951
00:101:30.520 --> 00:101:34.958
are marketed that don't work. Mhm. Uh And

1952
00:101:34.970 --> 00:101:39.859
, and sometimes are worse than useless. Um And

1953
00:101:39.869 --> 00:101:43.489
then was that because of statistical errors in the phase

1954
00:101:43.509 --> 00:101:47.100
three trials or was there faking going on? Um

1955
00:101:47.750 --> 00:101:51.810
Yeah, difficult or, or sometimes you even get

1956
00:101:51.819 --> 00:101:59.319
unregulated stuff like supplements, for example. Uh Yes

1957
00:101:59.329 --> 00:102:00.500
, but at least no one's, I mean,

1958
00:102:00.509 --> 00:102:03.128
no one's hopefully taking some of the those claims seriously

1959
00:102:03.140 --> 00:102:04.489
. But I was talking this morning, this is

1960
00:102:04.500 --> 00:102:08.088
someone on Twitter about there's this drug that makes you

1961
00:102:08.100 --> 00:102:11.729
apparently lose weight quite effectively. I forgot its name

1962
00:102:12.449 --> 00:102:14.259
. I think we V is one of the brand

1963
00:102:14.270 --> 00:102:16.289
names. And so what's happening now is people are

1964
00:102:16.298 --> 00:102:19.159
buying a fake version of it over the internet because

1965
00:102:19.168 --> 00:102:23.250
everyone read about it. Let's assume the research is

1966
00:102:23.259 --> 00:102:26.000
genuine and that the, the drug is great.

1967
00:102:26.798 --> 00:102:29.390
The pro the problem is the drug's quite hard to

1968
00:102:29.399 --> 00:102:30.159
get, you have to get it prescribed and your

1969
00:102:30.168 --> 00:102:32.369
doctor won't necessarily prescribe it for, you know,

1970
00:102:32.378 --> 00:102:35.310
something minor. Uh, and so people are going

1971
00:102:35.319 --> 00:102:38.020
out to the internet and buying it or at least

1972
00:102:38.029 --> 00:102:39.708
they think they're buying it. They're probably just getting

1973
00:102:39.720 --> 00:102:41.390
, you know, flour and water or something.

1974
00:102:41.770 --> 00:102:44.350
Uh, but to some extent that's a problem.

1975
00:102:45.168 --> 00:102:46.418
It, you've got a, you've got a societal

1976
00:102:46.430 --> 00:102:51.729
problem caused by the research on this drug that arguably

1977
00:102:51.739 --> 00:102:55.529
kind of isn't the fault of the people who made

1978
00:102:55.539 --> 00:102:59.939
the drug. But the, the press got hold

1979
00:102:59.949 --> 00:103:00.588
of it. You've got to get this, you

1980
00:103:00.600 --> 00:103:02.458
know, and, and they get whatever the 10

1981
00:103:02.470 --> 00:103:04.159
letter name of the drug is, you've gotta get

1982
00:103:04.168 --> 00:103:06.048
this and people go and type it into Google and

1983
00:103:06.060 --> 00:103:09.659
off, they go. Um, that's another problem

1984
00:103:09.668 --> 00:103:13.060
for society of, of, um, sort of

1985
00:103:13.069 --> 00:103:15.350
criminal derivation of, of, of, of,

1986
00:103:15.359 --> 00:103:17.140
of, of scientific research that we also have to

1987
00:103:17.149 --> 00:103:18.588
look at. So I think there's an even wider

1988
00:103:18.600 --> 00:103:21.668
problem of, of how do you communicate truth to

1989
00:103:21.680 --> 00:103:27.009
people, um, whether it's scientific truth or,

1990
00:103:27.458 --> 00:103:29.529
you know, political truth or, you know,

1991
00:103:30.168 --> 00:103:32.069
and, and then, you know, so we

1992
00:103:32.079 --> 00:103:34.289
, we t, I don't know it, this

1993
00:103:34.298 --> 00:103:35.520
is the kind of thing that we ought to be

1994
00:103:35.529 --> 00:103:39.659
able to ask psychologists about. It's just that psychologists

1995
00:103:40.418 --> 00:103:45.680
aren't very good at it as we've seen. Um

1996
00:103:45.739 --> 00:103:46.060
, if you look at, you know, during

1997
00:103:46.069 --> 00:103:49.319
COVID, um, some of the advice from the

1998
00:103:49.329 --> 00:103:51.659
psychologist. Well, it was based on this kind

1999
00:103:51.668 --> 00:103:54.789
of crappy nudging theory. Most of which I think

2000
00:103:54.798 --> 00:103:58.588
is probably, is probably at least at the very

2001
00:103:58.600 --> 00:104:00.529
least bad, bad signs and quite a lot of

2002
00:104:00.539 --> 00:104:03.159
it I suspect is faked. Um, but,

2003
00:104:03.168 --> 00:104:06.119
oh, yes, the nudging. Yes. Um

2004
00:104:06.149 --> 00:104:08.609
, there was a book you could buy at the

2005
00:104:08.619 --> 00:104:13.909
airport called Nudge. You remember that one? Well

2006
00:104:13.918 --> 00:104:15.958
, for example, that book, the first edition

2007
00:104:15.970 --> 00:104:19.140
was full of uh cute stuff by Brian Wansink,

2008
00:104:19.149 --> 00:104:23.729
the food research guy who then got fired by Cornell

2009
00:104:23.739 --> 00:104:27.779
after we showed that he'd been uh well, amongst

2010
00:104:27.789 --> 00:104:30.239
other things, making up his data. And uh

2011
00:104:30.250 --> 00:104:31.168
and then the second edition of that book came out

2012
00:104:31.180 --> 00:104:32.899
, but they just dropped all those references. They

2013
00:104:32.909 --> 00:104:36.680
didn't put a Ford say, oops, the first

2014
00:104:36.689 --> 00:104:40.060
edition of this book was full of bullshit about that

2015
00:104:40.069 --> 00:104:41.520
. Well, that all turned out to be crap

2016
00:104:41.529 --> 00:104:43.259
. But this stuff, you know, trust us

2017
00:104:43.270 --> 00:104:45.958
all the rest's really solid. They didn't say anything

2018
00:104:45.970 --> 00:104:46.439
at all. They just produced a new edition and

2019
00:104:46.449 --> 00:104:55.128
he was airbrushed out. Um You know, and

2020
00:104:55.140 --> 00:104:58.739
they, you know, these gu the um these

2021
00:104:58.750 --> 00:105:00.199
guys make quite a lot of money selling those books

2022
00:105:00.208 --> 00:105:04.239
and it was a bit embarrassing. So, uh

2023
00:105:04.958 --> 00:105:06.619
it's, it, it's a genuine problem, but

2024
00:105:06.628 --> 00:105:09.329
the problem is there isn't anyone who can do anything

2025
00:105:09.338 --> 00:105:10.838
about it. There isn't a pope, there isn't

2026
00:105:10.850 --> 00:105:14.390
a pope to say guys the entire scientific community,

2027
00:105:14.409 --> 00:105:16.859
you're stop doing this or there will be consequences.

2028
00:105:17.109 --> 00:105:19.759
Um So all we can, I think all we

2029
00:105:19.770 --> 00:105:25.140
can do is have um people like yourself holding science

2030
00:105:25.149 --> 00:105:30.979
to account uh and asking those awkward questions and um

2031
00:105:30.729 --> 00:105:32.640
you know, talking to people who disagree with me

2032
00:105:32.649 --> 00:105:35.668
as well, but we, we have to have

2033
00:105:35.680 --> 00:105:39.378
that level of scrutiny. Nothing would have happened in

2034
00:105:39.390 --> 00:105:41.869
the Weinstein case, for example, if Buzzfeed hadn't

2035
00:105:41.878 --> 00:105:43.449
, uh hadn't gone on to it, uh,

2036
00:105:43.470 --> 00:105:45.649
because it became too embarrassing for Cornell not to do

2037
00:105:45.659 --> 00:105:49.989
anything about it. Uh And uh, I mean

2038
00:105:50.000 --> 00:105:55.750
, actually the nudge book, uh reminded me of

2039
00:105:55.798 --> 00:105:59.708
, uh Dan Arielle who I guess I, I

2040
00:105:59.720 --> 00:106:01.149
, if I, if I'm not mistaken, even

2041
00:106:01.159 --> 00:106:05.909
rec just recently published a new book and iii I

2042
00:106:05.918 --> 00:106:10.890
haven't even read the book. But after all the

2043
00:106:10.899 --> 00:106:15.039
, the things that uh uh came out since 2021

2044
00:106:15.048 --> 00:106:17.649
about these fraudulent data and all of that, I

2045
00:106:17.659 --> 00:106:23.789
would imagine that probably he's still promoting some of his

2046
00:106:23.798 --> 00:106:28.079
fake ideas as if they were, but it's his

2047
00:106:28.088 --> 00:106:30.838
business model. He can't, you know, he

2048
00:106:30.850 --> 00:106:32.680
can't back away from that. He's committed to that

2049
00:106:32.838 --> 00:106:36.819
view of the world in which uh very small subtle

2050
00:106:36.829 --> 00:106:41.729
interventions that only he knows about, um, you

2051
00:106:41.739 --> 00:106:42.970
know, make a difference. And it's, it's

2052
00:106:42.979 --> 00:106:44.239
, it, you know, no, nobody else

2053
00:106:44.250 --> 00:106:46.220
reproduces these things. There's this whole thing of mindset

2054
00:106:46.229 --> 00:106:48.298
theory. So the mindset theory is that, you

2055
00:106:48.310 --> 00:106:51.009
know, students with a growth mindset, you know

2056
00:106:51.020 --> 00:106:55.208
, achieve better. And it's strange because this,

2057
00:106:55.458 --> 00:106:58.750
the claim is that any teacher, any school teacher

2058
00:106:58.759 --> 00:107:01.168
can go into their class and apply this. But

2059
00:107:01.180 --> 00:107:03.899
no psychologists have ever been able to replicate it.

2060
00:107:03.909 --> 00:107:06.628
So apparently it can be replicated freely by the person

2061
00:107:06.640 --> 00:107:09.899
who invented it, any school teacher, but no

2062
00:107:09.909 --> 00:107:14.750
other psychologists. Um, and, yeah, that

2063
00:107:14.759 --> 00:107:15.609
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

2064
00:107:15.859 --> 00:107:20.369
Um, and the, um, the, the

2065
00:107:20.378 --> 00:107:24.668
naive reader would draw conclusions about that which, um

2066
00:107:24.680 --> 00:107:27.378
, scientists are too polite, uh, to draw

2067
00:107:28.298 --> 00:107:31.479
. But, uh, the, the people reading

2068
00:107:31.489 --> 00:107:32.890
the books aren't getting that they say, oh,

2069
00:107:32.899 --> 00:107:36.329
you know, I, there, there's this interesting

2070
00:107:36.338 --> 00:107:39.750
research, my, my colleagues and I, at

2071
00:107:39.759 --> 00:107:43.600
university or whatever tested this with 300 undergraduates. We

2072
00:107:43.609 --> 00:107:45.539
found that when we did this, they did that

2073
00:107:45.548 --> 00:107:47.918
come by us. But, um, you know

2074
00:107:47.930 --> 00:107:50.850
, did it happen? Is that what really happened

2075
00:107:50.859 --> 00:107:51.939
? Did they know what, you know, does

2076
00:107:51.949 --> 00:107:54.649
that, can, we, can we really draw

2077
00:107:54.659 --> 00:107:57.069
that conclusion? Probably not. But I've got a

2078
00:107:57.079 --> 00:107:59.579
book to sell. Um, and the, yeah

2079
00:107:59.588 --> 00:108:01.878
, the nudge type stuff. Freakonomics. Freakonomics is

2080
00:108:01.890 --> 00:108:06.430
another one. the, a lot of the,

2081
00:108:06.439 --> 00:108:09.668
what, what they write about, uh, is

2082
00:108:09.680 --> 00:108:11.989
, is studies that either never happened or certainly didn't

2083
00:108:12.000 --> 00:108:15.399
happen as was described. Um, but that,

2084
00:108:15.409 --> 00:108:16.289
again, that's that whole industry now, you know

2085
00:108:16.298 --> 00:108:18.628
, there's that book, think like a freak and

2086
00:108:18.640 --> 00:108:20.659
it's like, oh, the thing to do is

2087
00:108:20.668 --> 00:108:25.979
to be counterintuitive. Everything is counterintuitive and when the

2088
00:108:25.989 --> 00:108:28.619
problem is when you get into everything being counterintuitive,

2089
00:108:28.628 --> 00:108:30.878
well, then you're into Chem Trails and five G

2090
00:108:30.890 --> 00:108:31.539
and, and all that because, hey, that's

2091
00:108:31.548 --> 00:108:38.699
counterintuitive too. Um, and you know why not

2092
00:108:38.708 --> 00:108:42.649
? Who says that can't be possible? Um,

2093
00:108:43.100 --> 00:108:45.489
it, it's very dangerous, it's very dangerous.

2094
00:108:45.500 --> 00:108:47.729
This idea that absolutely everything is counterintuitive cos actually most

2095
00:108:47.739 --> 00:108:51.250
things are, you know, true on their face

2096
00:108:53.449 --> 00:108:57.149
. Mhm. Uh So uh ju ju just to

2097
00:108:57.159 --> 00:108:59.949
, to wrap up our conversation, let me just

2098
00:108:59.958 --> 00:109:01.699
ask you, I guess one last question. So

2099
00:109:01.918 --> 00:109:05.970
when it comes to lay people specifically, if they

2100
00:109:05.979 --> 00:109:11.708
are exposed to a paper or to a piece of

2101
00:109:11.720 --> 00:109:16.789
news on mainstream media about some new a breakthrough research

2102
00:109:16.798 --> 00:109:18.560
, something like that. I mean, do you

2103
00:109:18.569 --> 00:109:21.119
think that there are perhaps, or there would be

2104
00:109:21.128 --> 00:109:27.128
good enough rules of um even from uh for non

2105
00:109:27.199 --> 00:109:32.668
experts to follow where perhaps there would be some things

2106
00:109:32.680 --> 00:109:36.009
they should be wary of things, they should pay

2107
00:109:36.020 --> 00:109:41.324
specific attention to where if they see them, they

2108
00:109:41.333 --> 00:109:44.845
should go. OK. So this is, I

2109
00:109:44.854 --> 00:109:46.274
should be careful about this. This is sort of

2110
00:109:46.284 --> 00:109:49.884
a preposterous claim. Let me just take a step

2111
00:109:49.895 --> 00:109:54.625
back and perhaps wait a while to see if there

2112
00:109:54.634 --> 00:110:00.164
are some reviews and critiques that come out to see

2113
00:110:00.194 --> 00:110:03.359
how it turns out uh what experts actually we see

2114
00:110:03.369 --> 00:110:05.750
about it. Um I'll give a plug here for

2115
00:110:05.759 --> 00:110:09.949
my friend Stuart Richie's book called Science Fictions in which

2116
00:110:09.958 --> 00:110:13.319
he sort of, in which he, you know

2117
00:110:13.329 --> 00:110:15.770
, tells, gives you these steps to go through

2118
00:110:15.989 --> 00:110:17.529
. But, uh, I'm not very optimistic that

2119
00:110:17.539 --> 00:110:19.189
, that many people will want to do it because

2120
00:110:19.199 --> 00:110:23.020
people are, people are absorbing this on their commute

2121
00:110:23.029 --> 00:110:24.628
into work. You know, in the, in

2122
00:110:24.640 --> 00:110:26.435
the, in the, in the 20 minutes free

2123
00:110:26.444 --> 00:110:29.555
newspaper, a new study shows, blah, blah

2124
00:110:29.564 --> 00:110:30.884
, blah. Next page, somebody got mugged in

2125
00:110:30.895 --> 00:110:33.284
your neighborhood last night. Next page, the football

2126
00:110:33.293 --> 00:110:36.564
results. And it's just part of the, it's

2127
00:110:36.574 --> 00:110:40.333
just part of the entertainment churn. And then,

2128
00:110:40.345 --> 00:110:41.984
yeah, sometimes I'll be out, I'll meet people

2129
00:110:41.994 --> 00:110:43.435
on a walk or something and they'll say, oh

2130
00:110:43.444 --> 00:110:45.845
, I read that X, you know, causes

2131
00:110:45.854 --> 00:110:47.805
why. And it's like, hm. But sometimes

2132
00:110:47.814 --> 00:110:49.963
people will say, I don't believe any of it

2133
00:110:50.470 --> 00:110:55.750
because they're always telling you that this causes cancer and

2134
00:110:55.759 --> 00:110:58.779
then they're telling you that this cures cancer. Why

2135
00:110:58.789 --> 00:111:01.069
won't the scientists make up their minds? And I

2136
00:111:01.079 --> 00:111:03.628
used to say, I used to say this isn't

2137
00:111:03.640 --> 00:111:06.060
the scientists, this is the journalists. Uh,

2138
00:111:06.088 --> 00:111:09.989
but it turns out that a lot of it is

2139
00:111:10.000 --> 00:111:12.350
the scientists and I wish the scientists would stop doing

2140
00:111:12.359 --> 00:111:15.079
this. But the scientists will then say, oh

2141
00:111:15.088 --> 00:111:16.479
yeah, but we didn't say that, you know

2142
00:111:16.489 --> 00:111:18.409
, we had this study and which said that this

2143
00:111:18.418 --> 00:111:23.918
is associated with this in rats. Uh But they

2144
00:111:23.930 --> 00:111:28.289
allowed their, they allowed their study in rats to

2145
00:111:28.298 --> 00:111:31.180
be turned into a news item. Um, and

2146
00:111:31.189 --> 00:111:32.378
they might even say, oh, well, the

2147
00:111:32.390 --> 00:111:35.079
university press office obliged us to it. It's like

2148
00:111:35.088 --> 00:111:36.979
, well, you're not, not obliged to,

2149
00:111:38.720 --> 00:111:41.079
you're not obliged. So you can choose not to

2150
00:111:41.088 --> 00:111:43.319
do it. You went along with it because it

2151
00:111:43.329 --> 00:111:45.659
was the easy thing to do. And then they

2152
00:111:45.668 --> 00:111:47.680
might say, yeah, but, you know,

2153
00:111:47.689 --> 00:111:53.878
my university ranks people on their public impact and they

2154
00:111:53.890 --> 00:111:56.180
may well be right. And so on the other

2155
00:111:56.189 --> 00:111:59.310
hand, it is quite difficult to critique people for

2156
00:111:59.319 --> 00:112:02.810
their uh behavior as scientists. It, it it's

2157
00:112:02.819 --> 00:112:05.229
easy to critique them when they got a million dollar

2158
00:112:05.239 --> 00:112:09.838
book deal off the back of it. Understandable why

2159
00:112:09.850 --> 00:112:11.458
they would do that. But it's easy to critique

2160
00:112:11.470 --> 00:112:13.439
them. It's less easy to critique them when they

2161
00:112:13.449 --> 00:112:17.359
have a precarious contract of employment. And they sincerely

2162
00:112:17.369 --> 00:112:20.119
believe that going along with a little bit of the

2163
00:112:20.128 --> 00:112:24.640
excess of the press department is the requirement to still

2164
00:112:24.649 --> 00:112:28.250
have a job paying them 2000 a month or 4000

2165
00:112:28.259 --> 00:112:30.399
a month next year. And I think we have

2166
00:112:30.409 --> 00:112:32.350
to be a little bit careful about dismissing sort of

2167
00:112:32.359 --> 00:112:35.329
, you know, the, the incentives because we

2168
00:112:35.338 --> 00:112:38.189
see the results of the, you know, the

2169
00:112:38.199 --> 00:112:42.628
high end thing and the$100,000 consulting gigs. But

2170
00:112:42.640 --> 00:112:44.668
we also have to acknowledge that there are lots and

2171
00:112:44.680 --> 00:112:45.668
lots of people who really want to keep doing this

2172
00:112:45.680 --> 00:112:49.088
line of work um and who are prepared to do

2173
00:112:49.100 --> 00:112:50.759
what it takes to stay in that. It's one

2174
00:112:50.770 --> 00:112:53.310
of the reasons why I think we need to have

2175
00:112:53.319 --> 00:112:57.378
fewer scientists, uh is because once people are in

2176
00:112:57.390 --> 00:113:02.579
that system, the system owes them an honest opportunity

2177
00:113:02.838 --> 00:113:05.109
to keep going within that. I think if you

2178
00:113:05.119 --> 00:113:11.319
have any kind of uh profession that isn't casual employment

2179
00:113:12.649 --> 00:113:15.109
and you ask people to make a commitment to being

2180
00:113:15.119 --> 00:113:19.029
trained to do that profession of engineer or, or

2181
00:113:19.039 --> 00:113:25.259
lawyer or accountant. I think it's incumbent on that

2182
00:113:25.569 --> 00:113:30.159
profession, that domain of human activity to have a

2183
00:113:30.168 --> 00:113:34.759
reasonable opportunity for people who've made that commitment to go

2184
00:113:34.770 --> 00:113:40.588
for a decent length of career within that field where

2185
00:113:40.600 --> 00:113:43.119
they chose to give up their twenties, getting trained

2186
00:113:44.409 --> 00:113:45.009
. And at the moment, we have a situation

2187
00:113:45.020 --> 00:113:47.829
where we, we train all these scientists but there

2188
00:113:47.838 --> 00:113:51.878
simply isn't enough stable employment for them. And as

2189
00:113:51.890 --> 00:113:56.489
a result, we make them jump through hoops and

2190
00:113:56.500 --> 00:114:00.020
, you know, perform little tricks to stay,

2191
00:114:00.439 --> 00:114:01.140
um, in, uh which, which first of

2192
00:114:01.149 --> 00:114:02.779
all means we select for the people who are best

2193
00:114:02.789 --> 00:114:05.060
at doing the little tricks, but also the whole

2194
00:114:05.069 --> 00:114:08.958
premise was, well, we'll push all these phd

2195
00:114:08.970 --> 00:114:11.048
s through the system and we'll, we'll cream off

2196
00:114:11.060 --> 00:114:13.909
the 15 or 20% best ones. You shouldn't be

2197
00:114:13.918 --> 00:114:16.140
doing that. You should be selecting people much more

2198
00:114:16.149 --> 00:114:20.259
rigorously for their potential to be, have a good

2199
00:114:20.270 --> 00:114:23.689
long career as scientists. And I'm, I if

2200
00:114:23.699 --> 00:114:26.739
you go along to law school and you're just not

2201
00:114:26.869 --> 00:114:28.878
up to, you know, whatever I don't know

2202
00:114:28.890 --> 00:114:30.338
what the qualifications are or what. But I'm sure

2203
00:114:30.350 --> 00:114:32.350
there are ways, I'm sure there are people who

2204
00:114:32.359 --> 00:114:35.000
go to law school and after two months, you

2205
00:114:35.009 --> 00:114:39.020
know, people around them will realize, look sorry

2206
00:114:39.029 --> 00:114:40.949
, but you're never gonna make it in the law

2207
00:114:41.628 --> 00:114:43.489
, you know, because of the way your mind

2208
00:114:43.500 --> 00:114:45.369
works or whatever it is. And, you know

2209
00:114:45.890 --> 00:114:49.399
, hopefully, well, you failed them perhaps.

2210
00:114:49.409 --> 00:114:51.548
I don't know. Uh, but we, we

2211
00:114:51.560 --> 00:114:54.079
, we, it seems to me that in science

2212
00:114:54.088 --> 00:114:56.039
that is completely out of whack and we're bringing in

2213
00:114:56.048 --> 00:114:58.229
so many people and then they, they, they

2214
00:114:58.239 --> 00:115:00.319
wanna continue in what they're doing. But that's,

2215
00:115:00.329 --> 00:115:03.250
I think a legitimate social contract with people now who

2216
00:115:03.259 --> 00:115:05.399
is running that system. I don't know. But

2217
00:115:05.949 --> 00:115:09.270
worlds of, I don't know, don't know about

2218
00:115:09.279 --> 00:115:11.869
journalism but words of engineering law and things like that

2219
00:115:11.930 --> 00:115:14.338
when we bring you into the system, the deal

2220
00:115:14.350 --> 00:115:16.750
is that if you pass the exams with a reasonable

2221
00:115:16.759 --> 00:115:19.479
degree of competency, there will very likely be a

2222
00:115:19.489 --> 00:115:24.199
job for you somewhere. And that simply isn't the

2223
00:115:24.208 --> 00:115:27.168
case in science. Um And so I, as

2224
00:115:27.180 --> 00:115:30.109
I say, my, my fundamental that everything I've

2225
00:115:30.119 --> 00:115:30.829
told you in the last two hours, you could

2226
00:115:30.838 --> 00:115:33.470
have heard from a dozen other people apart from perhaps

2227
00:115:33.479 --> 00:115:39.149
my position that we need to train vastly fewer scientists

2228
00:115:39.189 --> 00:115:42.100
than we currently do. Not because the world might

2229
00:115:42.109 --> 00:115:44.600
not be a better place with all those scientists,

2230
00:115:44.609 --> 00:115:45.739
but because we simply don't have room for them.

2231
00:115:46.548 --> 00:115:49.779
We don't have the capacity to absorb either the people

2232
00:115:49.789 --> 00:115:53.770
or anything they might output. Uh, and we

2233
00:115:53.779 --> 00:115:56.329
just have to accept that in the same way that

2234
00:115:56.338 --> 00:116:00.569
we don't put, um, 20,000 kids a year

2235
00:116:00.579 --> 00:116:04.729
through professional football academies. Mhm. You know,

2236
00:116:04.739 --> 00:116:08.949
your, uh, whatever your favorite football team is

2237
00:116:08.958 --> 00:116:14.979
has an academy and they know they know that 90%

2238
00:116:14.989 --> 00:116:16.939
of the 14 year olds won't make it. 70%

2239
00:116:16.949 --> 00:116:19.329
of the 16 year olds won't make it. But

2240
00:116:19.338 --> 00:116:23.689
they don't, they could, they could take in

2241
00:116:23.699 --> 00:116:28.259
three times as many kids. And occasionally, you

2242
00:116:28.270 --> 00:116:29.789
know, the ones who they, let's say at

2243
00:116:29.798 --> 00:116:30.659
the moment they take in the ones who score nine

2244
00:116:30.668 --> 00:116:32.399
out of 10, they could take in all the

2245
00:116:32.409 --> 00:116:35.289
ones who currently score eight out of 10. Occasionally

2246
00:116:35.298 --> 00:116:38.819
, one or two of those would blossom and become

2247
00:116:38.829 --> 00:116:40.899
16 year olds and go on to become professional.

2248
00:116:40.909 --> 00:116:43.759
But the trail they would lead in there and there's

2249
00:116:43.770 --> 00:116:45.088
a, the cost of doing it. But there's

2250
00:116:45.100 --> 00:116:48.399
also, I think a certain moral obligation within that

2251
00:116:48.409 --> 00:116:50.958
field to say, look, the chances that he

2252
00:116:50.970 --> 00:116:54.979
or that this person will make it as, as

2253
00:116:54.989 --> 00:116:57.680
a profession are so low that we're going to take

2254
00:116:57.689 --> 00:117:00.000
the risk of missing out on the next Lionel Messi

2255
00:117:00.009 --> 00:117:01.000
because, you know, we just have to do

2256
00:117:01.009 --> 00:117:02.699
that. And it's, I at the moment it's

2257
00:117:02.708 --> 00:117:05.479
as if it's as if your local football team had

2258
00:117:05.489 --> 00:117:10.239
Tween took 2030 times more people than they need into

2259
00:117:10.250 --> 00:117:12.649
the academy. 14 year olds go, hey,

2260
00:117:12.659 --> 00:117:15.199
I'm at the FC, whatever academy. That's fantastic

2261
00:117:15.500 --> 00:117:15.560
. And, and you go, yeah, you're

2262
00:117:16.140 --> 00:117:19.409
not gonna, you do know it's very unlikely.

2263
00:117:19.750 --> 00:117:21.560
And I think we would, if that was happening

2264
00:117:21.569 --> 00:117:25.100
we would consider that there was an ethical, an

2265
00:117:25.109 --> 00:117:27.680
ethical problem. Maybe there already is. Maybe they're

2266
00:117:27.689 --> 00:117:29.390
already training to me. I don't know. But

2267
00:117:29.399 --> 00:117:30.939
we would, you know, we would be talking

2268
00:117:30.949 --> 00:117:31.949
about that and I, I don't think we talk

2269
00:117:31.958 --> 00:117:33.798
about that in, in science. I'm not certain

2270
00:117:33.810 --> 00:117:38.619
why or outside science, maybe that's your next kind

2271
00:117:38.628 --> 00:117:41.310
of investigative mission is why are we, why do

2272
00:117:41.319 --> 00:117:45.449
we train so many scientists? Because we have so

2273
00:117:45.458 --> 00:117:47.229
many professors because they were trained as scientists. You

2274
00:117:47.239 --> 00:117:49.220
know, we've got this, we've got this huge

2275
00:117:49.229 --> 00:117:54.119
machine and it has to be kept going and we

2276
00:117:54.128 --> 00:117:58.878
, in our society, we associate any machine getting

2277
00:117:58.890 --> 00:118:01.430
smaller as a sign of failure, right? You

2278
00:118:01.439 --> 00:118:05.600
know, why have half the psychology departments in our

2279
00:118:05.609 --> 00:118:10.659
universities closed? There's not going to be an article

2280
00:118:10.668 --> 00:118:14.579
saying actually this is a good thing, you know

2281
00:118:14.850 --> 00:118:16.009
, it's going to be interviews with the people who

2282
00:118:16.020 --> 00:118:19.489
lost their jobs and, and my, my kind

2283
00:118:19.500 --> 00:118:23.128
of assertion is that we shouldn't have hired a lot

2284
00:118:23.140 --> 00:118:25.659
of those people in the first place. But this

2285
00:118:25.668 --> 00:118:27.579
will, this will, this, this doesn't make

2286
00:118:27.588 --> 00:118:29.390
me too popular. I'm surprised that it doesn't make

2287
00:118:29.399 --> 00:118:30.548
me more unpopular, but it doesn't. Yeah.

2288
00:118:31.899 --> 00:118:34.199
No, no one's no-one's yet invited me on their

2289
00:118:34.208 --> 00:118:36.989
podcast to give a good, full 45 minute exposition

2290
00:118:38.000 --> 00:118:42.759
of exactly how I think that should work. Well

2291
00:118:42.770 --> 00:118:45.140
, I, it's food for thought. Anyway,

2292
00:118:45.149 --> 00:118:47.520
I guess let's end on that note. And Doctor

2293
00:118:47.529 --> 00:118:50.069
Brown, uh, just before we go, would

2294
00:118:50.079 --> 00:118:54.128
you like to tell people where they can find you

2295
00:118:54.140 --> 00:118:56.979
when you work on the internet? So, I'm

2296
00:118:56.989 --> 00:118:59.600
still on Twitter and, uh, you can put

2297
00:118:59.609 --> 00:119:00.239
the link in cos if I try and spell it

2298
00:119:00.250 --> 00:119:02.399
, it'll you um you can put my Twitter handle

2299
00:119:02.409 --> 00:119:04.609
on there. I, I suppose at some point

2300
00:119:04.619 --> 00:119:08.369
I will move over to blue sky like everybody else

2301
00:119:08.489 --> 00:119:12.970
. Um And one or other of those uh will

2302
00:119:12.979 --> 00:119:15.449
be the best place to contact me. And if

2303
00:119:15.458 --> 00:119:17.220
not, um Ricardo, you can put, for

2304
00:119:17.229 --> 00:119:21.128
example, the address of my blog um in the

2305
00:119:21.140 --> 00:119:25.668
in the blurb and um people will be able to

2306
00:119:25.680 --> 00:119:30.668
find my contact details through that. OK? So

2307
00:119:30.680 --> 00:119:33.409
I'm leaving links to that in the description box of

2308
00:119:33.418 --> 00:119:36.109
the interview and Doctor Brown, thank you again for

2309

taking the time to come on the show. It's

2310
00:119:38.798 --> 00:119:40.588
been fun to talk to you, but I,

2311
00:119:40.600 --> 00:119:42.838
I enjoyed it and I, I hope there's uh

2312
00:119:42.850 --> 00:119:45.029
I hope there's something here you can use without your

2313
00:119:45.039 --> 00:119:50.000
lawyers getting to uh getting too upset. Hi guys
