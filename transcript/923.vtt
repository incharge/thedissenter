00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.910
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.739
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob. And

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.449
today I'm joined by Dr Nicholas Brown. He's a

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.350
researcher at Linnaeus University in Sweden. He works on

5
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.409
developing new research methods in psychology and on applying

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.094
meta scientific perspectives on psychology as a. And today

7
00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.635
we're going to go through topics like conceptual and

8
00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:28.315
methodological issues in positive psychology and the study of

9
00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:32.185
well being. And then we're going to go through

10
00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:37.424
a few other studies, psychology related studies to talk

11
00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:41.729
about examples of bad science. And then we're also

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.830
going to talk a little bit about where bad

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.229
science stems from and how we can deal with

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.889
it. So, Doctor Brown, welcome to the show. It's

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.090
a pleasure to everyone.

16
00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:54.930
Thank you for inviting me. It's always uh always

17
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:56.430
interesting to talk about what I'm doing.

18
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.310
OK. So let's start here with a positive psychology

19
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.660
and the study of the determinants of well being.

20
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.319
So, uh first of all, tell us a little

21
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.919
bit about how you got interested in this subject

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.360
specifically and then we can get into some of

23
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.550
the issues you found there.

24
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.589
Well, until 2009, I was a, I was a

25
00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.169
computer guy and I was a manager in an

26
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.540
IT department. And then in what I like to

27
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.750
call a terrible administrative mix up, I got moved

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.790
to the HR department. Uh, AND since my, my

29
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.550
bachelor's in computer science had served me well for

30
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.879
the previous 28 years in it, I thought that

31
00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.750
maybe I should get some kind of, uh, formal

32
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.750
training in something to do with people, which was,

33
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.449
you know, never II I like to think I

34
00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.430
was a good pragmatic manager, but I had no

35
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.610
theory. And um due to a chance encounter uh

36
00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:52.830
with Professor Richard, Professor Richard Wiseman, who was a

37
00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.300
sort of fairly well known uh British uh psychologist

38
00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:59.239
Piers in the media. And, and he mentioned, I

39
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.519
I asked him whether there was kind of any

40
00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:06.279
um science that could help with, um particularly when

41
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.089
you work in a large organization, uh your, your

42
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.600
human resources department sends you on training courses to

43
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.369
teach you to be a less bad manager and

44
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.429
things like that. And uh and it seemed to

45
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.139
me this was my, in my new job buying,

46
00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.559
buying in those services was part of my responsibility

47
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.259
and it seemed to me that it was all

48
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.250
a bit hand wavy. So I asked Professor Wiseman,

49
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.669
you know, if there's any kind of theory there?

50
00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.110
And he said, well, there is this sub sub.

51
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.190
Now he could have mentioned the good old fashioned,

52
00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.720
uh, organizational and, uh, and industrial io psychology. Or

53
00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.059
he could have mentioned, you know, management schools, schools,

54
00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:42.229
but he mentioned this. He said his new field

55
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.899
called Positive Psychology. They have a Masters at the

56
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.869
University of East London. And it's quite funny because,

57
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.619
like, I think a lot of people I have

58
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.089
a recurring, or I had a recurring nightmare, which

59
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.210
is that it was three weeks until my school

60
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.649
leaving exams. But I had my present knowledge, uh,

61
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.729
of the subject matter. Um, AND so I didn't

62
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.330
imagine in a million years that I'd be going

63
00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:03.880
back to school. But there, I was at the

64
00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.949
age of 50 doing this masters in something called

65
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.169
applied positive psychology. And I had this very naive

66
00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.809
view of what psychology could teach us about anything.

67
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.440
So, in, in 2011, yeah, I couldn't have named

68
00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.779
you three living psychologists. Uh, FOR example, uh, so

69
00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.679
I had a, you know, that was a quick,

70
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.130
that was a fast introduction to psychology in general.

71
00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.020
I had no, absolutely no background, uh, positive psychology

72
00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.070
and, um, as, as part of a, a taught

73
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.190
master's program with a little bit of a research

74
00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.729
project tacked onto the end of it. But, um,

75
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.179
that was how I, I got into that. Um,

76
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.289
AND about halfway through it was a two year

77
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.100
masters, the opportunity came up to take early retirement.

78
00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.169
So I left paid employment in the end of

79
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:53.649
June 2012 and decided to see what would turn

80
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.690
up in terms of things to interest me. And

81
00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.639
since then I finished the masters, uh I spent

82
00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:00.520
a year in a psychotherapy school where I learned

83
00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.889
that I would be AAA pretty poor psychotherapist. And

84
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.139
um then I got a, I got a chance

85
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:12.419
to be on a phd program uh using some

86
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.820
of the critical stuff that I was writing about

87
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.988
positive psychology and then psychology in general. And more

88
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.929
recently, my work has gone into um bad science

89
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.179
and up to and including fraudulent science and in

90
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.959
psychology and areas beyond. Um BUT the, the kinds

91
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.820
of analyses I do are more suited to uh

92
00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:38.320
social science type uh situations. Although I also do

93
00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:41.559
work on that in things like biomedical, some biomedical

94
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.709
fields. So there's the whole, the whole spectrum of

95
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.589
the science reform movement from doing things a bit

96
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.799
better up to doing less fraud is, is roughly

97
00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.040
where I am today. But I, I, yeah, I,

98
00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:57.540
I started off critiquing uh positive psychology both kind

99
00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:01.290
of somewhat theoretically although, you know, I don't have

100
00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:04.839
the psychological background to really, you know, heavily critique

101
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.070
every single construct in terms of the history of

102
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.079
the literature. Um AND, and, and also pragmatically and,

103
00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.940
and experimental.

104
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.440
OK. But uh tell us a bit about that.

105
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.670
What were some of the main conceptual and methodological

106
00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:23.070
issues you, you found in positive psychology and the

107
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.029
study of well being?

108
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.329
Well, what I found coming from the outside was

109
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.989
uh and I mean, maybe this is a criticism

110
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.339
of just how psychology works in general. But I,

111
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.220
I know there are people within psychology who talk

112
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.410
about this is what are we measuring? And how

113
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.220
are we saying that things are better or, or,

114
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.149
or, or what is well being? How do you

115
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.779
measure well-being? And it seems to me you can

116
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.010
get psychologists to agree among themselves occasionally that something

117
00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.470
is a measure of well-being. But whether or not

118
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.510
that actually relates to what ordinary individuals would talk

119
00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.619
about, I don't know. One of the criticisms I

120
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.619
have, for example, is a lot of positive psychology

121
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.160
research uh will say that an intervention made people

122
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.959
happier. And what they will do is they will

123
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.640
count uh an improvement in scores on the BD

124
00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:12.059
I two, the beck depression inventory, which is kind

125
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.600
of the, the gold standard test. But if you

126
00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:17.329
go to a doctor and say, I think I

127
00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:21.049
am depressed, they may give you this. Um So

128
00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:25.559
the BD I is 21 items and each of

129
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.929
them is scored 0 to 3. And the idea

130
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.640
is that uh uh we can say normal, we're

131
00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.649
allowed to say no normal person and a healthy

132
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.970
person will typically respond zero to almost all of

133
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.890
them. Because if you actually read the questions, even,

134
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.290
even level one, even a level one answer is

135
00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:44.519
like, wow, that's, that's somebody you might say is

136
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.750
quite often, quite sad, et cetera. Um And a

137
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.290
typical score out of 63 possible on this in

138
00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:54.040
a normal healthy population is about three or four.

139
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.070
So there are about three items out of 21

140
00:06:57.079 --> 00:07:01.399
that a normal person might endorse. Um AND a

141
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.290
a at the first level. And in order to

142
00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:09.290
qualify for a diagnosis of mild depression, you have

143
00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:13.420
to score 14. Um WHICH, and if you read

144
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:15.130
it, if you read the BD I, and, and

145
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.959
if you yourself have no experience of mental illness

146
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.720
or depression, uh and you think, you know, if

147
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.160
I was endorsing 14 of those, most people, I

148
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.089
think who have no experience of men would go

149
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.820
God, if I was endorsing 14 of those, I'd,

150
00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:31.220
I'd feel pretty bad. You have to get to

151
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.170
14 to be mild depression, then there's moderate and

152
00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:38.850
then there's severe with even higher scores. Now, quite

153
00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:41.559
a lot of positive psychology studies will go out

154
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.529
and, and recruit people. And the whole point of

155
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.000
positive psychology is, it's the psychology of people who

156
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.299
are not depressed and who just want to sort

157
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:51.399
of do a bit better in life and they

158
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.640
will measure their BD I scores and they'll get

159
00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:56.260
a mean of 4.2 and then they'll do this

160
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.649
whatever psychology, positive psychology intervention and the, the mean

161
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.970
will be 3.8. But I don't know what, what

162
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.079
is the difference between 4.2 and 3.8 when to

163
00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:10.359
even be mildly depressed, you have to be 40.

164
00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:14.350
Why are we measuring at this, you know, ridiculously

165
00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:17.730
low end where, you know, nobody is in any

166
00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.670
sense depressed. And we're saying, well, they're, they weren't

167
00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:22.739
depressed before and now they are very slightly more

168
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.260
not depressed. I don't think that that necessarily constitutes

169
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:30.760
a good measure of whether people are uh experiencing

170
00:08:30.769 --> 00:08:35.200
well-being and something I learned as I went along,

171
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.349
particularly on my master's course. But, but other uh

172
00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:40.679
talking to other people is that a lot of

173
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.030
people who are studying positive psychology are actually quite

174
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.900
depressed, but they are, it seems to me and

175
00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:49.299
this is, this is an opinion and a judgment,

176
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.309
a lot of people who are attracted to positive

177
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.159
psychology are kind of in denial about being depressed

178
00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:56.390
and think that if they could just be a

179
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.770
bit happier, whatever that would mean that they would

180
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.590
be no longer depressed. So then the question is,

181
00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:06.940
is depression the opposite of happiness. And psychologists have

182
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.619
been arguing about that for years, are positive emotions

183
00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:15.080
qualitatively different from negative emotions or are they just

184
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.150
uh you know, plus and minus versions of the

185
00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:22.000
same thing and emotions researchers don't agree about that.

186
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.909
So it, it seemed to me that a lot

187
00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:28.580
of it was um it was ostensibly aimed at

188
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.770
making people who were not depressed happier, but a

189
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.159
lot of the people who want to. Oh, I

190
00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:34.130
really, it would be so much, the world would

191
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.559
be so much better if people were a bit

192
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.979
happier, were really, to some extent talking about either

193
00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:40.859
themselves or their, their depressed friends or, or whatever,

194
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:43.460
because a lot of people get into psychology, either

195
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:45.940
to understand their own problems or the problems of

196
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.119
the people immediately around them. Um, AND then the

197
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.219
other side of it was, if it wasn't about

198
00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.840
that, the problem was, it was very kind of,

199
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.289
it seemed very suburban and middle class American. Uh,

200
00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.609
IT seemed like it was an ideal vehicle for

201
00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:09.489
selling you books for 2499 and improve your well-being

202
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.400
courses for 4 99 99 for 10 episodes. You

203
00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:14.929
know, and you can keep the podcast, you can

204
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.130
keep the MP3 file for a week, that kind

205
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.630
of thing that it, it, it was very, very

206
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.200
easy to be skeptical about it or to be

207
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.690
cynical about it in terms of somebody's making quite

208
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.619
a lot of money out of it. Mhm. And

209
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.349
I kind of have this naive view of science

210
00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:34.650
that science ought to be kind of free. Mm.

211
00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:40.000
Um, II, I, I'm not against capitalism or industry

212
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.070
or anything like that but basic, a scientific finding

213
00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.590
should be, uh, you know, if you, if you've

214
00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:50.010
discovered a truth about the universe, I don't think

215
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.659
that's really something you should be able to kind

216
00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:55.190
of patent and license and make money on and,

217
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.299
and, I mean, this is a problem throughout psychology

218
00:10:57.309 --> 00:11:00.679
is that, uh, a lot of the measures, I

219
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.049
don't know, I don't know if the BD I

220
00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:03.159
is one of them, but a lot of the

221
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:05.869
clinical measures you have to pay, you have to

222
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.020
pay some psychologist 20 bucks to administer this scale

223
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.619
to a patient. And it's like, well, it's, is

224
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.960
it a pharmaceutical thing? Have you manufactured anything? Just,

225
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.349
I, I don't know, uh, who paid for the

226
00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:25.929
research that discovered it? You know, if the NIH

227
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.979
funded it and you discovered it and now you're

228
00:11:27.989 --> 00:11:29.979
selling the result for 20 bucks, how much of

229
00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:32.299
that is going back to the NIH? So, I

230
00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:33.729
don't know, I think there are, I, I just

231
00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:35.840
found that there were all kinds of, of, of

232
00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:38.929
those kind of issues which everybody in psychology seemed

233
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.909
to think was completely normal. So maybe, you know,

234
00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:43.659
maybe I was wrong but I had the impression

235
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:46.849
that this was, this wasn't how I thought science

236
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.539
was done.

237
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.929
Mhm. And I guess we'll come back to some

238
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.940
of these issues later on. When, toward the end

239
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.299
of our interview, we'll talk about bad science and

240
00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:02.979
what I guess motivates it, et cetera. But uh

241
00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:05.070
I would like to ask you now about a

242
00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:10.059
piece of work that you yourself critiqued coming from.

243
00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:12.989
Uh I hope I'm pronouncing the name correctly. Leu

244
00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:17.780
Bomi at all. I mean, their a happiness pie.

245
00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:21.500
Well, I mean, what is, what were they really

246
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.130
working on? There, what is these or what was

247
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.960
this happiness pay really about? And what would you

248
00:12:28.969 --> 00:12:31.500
say were the issues with it?

249
00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:33.979
Well, the way I read it now is that

250
00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:36.719
in the early days of the Positive Psychology movement,

251
00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:38.989
which was kind of launched with a bang by

252
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.919
a bunch of psychologists saying, you know, we're mad

253
00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:42.419
as hell and we're not gonna take it anymore.

254
00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.690
We want people to be happier. We're not just

255
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.270
going to be about, you know, depression. And um

256
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.900
it's, it was kind of a pa it was

257
00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:55.299
a paper that kind of positioned the idea that

258
00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:59.729
people have a substantial amount of control over their

259
00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:03.340
levels of happiness based on what they choose to

260
00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:10.200
do. And so it took a very, it made

261
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.299
it, it, it took what we know about the,

262
00:13:14.309 --> 00:13:18.359
the extent to which your t trait happiness is

263
00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:22.659
genetically determined. Uh And when we say genetically, not

264
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.760
just, you know, genes and your uh uh interaction

265
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.549
with the environment and they sort of said it,

266
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:35.119
that's about 50%. Now, it's probably a bit higher

267
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.469
than 50% but that wasn't really the big issue.

268
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:40.750
And then they said, and your life circumstances only

269
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.010
account for about 10% of your happens. Uh And

270
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.469
they added the 50 the 10 got to 60

271
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:53.330
subtracted that 60% from one and said, therefore, 40%

272
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.900
of your happiness uh is um you know, you

273
00:13:57.909 --> 00:13:59.659
can change, you can make a difference to your

274
00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:04.859
happiness. And this is conceptually not very good. Uh

275
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:07.640
First of all, these are all population level things.

276
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.150
They don't tell us anything about individuals. But by

277
00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.140
far, the biggest problem was it is absurd to

278
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:18.140
say that people's happiness is only influenced to 10%

279
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.299
of the variance in happiness will be explained by

280
00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:25.299
life circumstances. Uh If you look at um you

281
00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:27.080
know, the, the, the countries that are the happiest

282
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.210
in the world on that one item, how happy

283
00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:31.590
are you survey that comes out every year? Denmark

284
00:14:31.729 --> 00:14:41.210
scores 7.9. Syria scores 2.4. Um It does that

285
00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:44.530
mean. Yeah, so one of them is now, how

286
00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:47.760
should we just say one's one's multiplied by three

287
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.909
to get the other? Let's do that. Let's naively

288
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.479
say that people in Denmark are three times happier

289
00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:58.429
than people in Syria. Um Is that because the

290
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.549
people in Syria are not, you know, listening to

291
00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:04.469
the right kind of music that they really like

292
00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:07.239
or, you know, they, you know, they just need

293
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.929
to kind of get some kind of lifestyle makeover.

294
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.760
Is there maybe something else about living in Syria

295
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.320
about the circumstances of living in Syria uh that

296
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.390
make people less happy? Uh And, and you can

297
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.789
even, you could look at this, for example, with

298
00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:24.650
Greece, where Greece went from scoring like 5.9 I

299
00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:25.859
don't know the numbers off the top of my

300
00:15:25.869 --> 00:15:29.510
head, but basically between 2005, 2014, the whole Greek

301
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.570
financial crisis, the Greek scores went from about 5.9

302
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.869
or something to about 4.2. So Greeks became 40%

303
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.229
less happy. Now, was that because they stopped going

304
00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:45.500
to the gym or did something else happen in

305
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.030
Greece? That? And so it turned out that circumstances

306
00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:50.729
have an enormous effect. And so I went and

307
00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:54.500
dug into what was the source for this claim.

308
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.030
And it turned out to be um some studies

309
00:15:58.039 --> 00:16:00.700
of Americans. First of all, everybody in the survey

310
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.289
was Americans. So the circumstances that they were looking

311
00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:08.679
at could only have been circumstances that are common

312
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.219
to Americans. So there was no, there was nothing

313
00:16:11.229 --> 00:16:13.320
in there about, have you got clean drinking water?

314
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.109
Uh Do you live in a, you know, in

315
00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:18.349
a democracy because everyone had that in common. But

316
00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:21.200
secondly, also if you actually looked what they call

317
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.250
um life circumstances, there were just half a dozen

318
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.479
demographic variables. They didn't in the studies that they

319
00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:31.190
were quoting the what they was not a full

320
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.849
investigation of people's life circumstances. So basically, it was

321
00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:40.250
a hand waving reference to research that didn't show

322
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.539
what they said it showed. And the net result

323
00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:45.150
was, they said only 10% is due to circumstances.

324
00:16:45.159 --> 00:16:48.390
Therefore, the other 40% is available for you as

325
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.239
an individual um to, to alter. In addition, while

326
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.479
the paper itself had one or two hedges about

327
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.619
about this and, and not enough, it certainly didn't

328
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.460
combine the variant in an appropriate way. But nonetheless,

329
00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:07.319
it kind of acknowledged that these, he um Lubomirski

330
00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:12.140
then wrote two books, uh particularly the first one,

331
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
which was the How of Happiness, which had a

332
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.829
picture of this happiness pie. So the pie was

333
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:21.010
the pie chart. 50% gene genetic, 10% circumstances, 40%

334
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.618
you can improve your happiness. Um And you know,

335
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.699
she actually wrote things like that. 40% is yours

336
00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:30.790
to guide. You know, you, you the reader, you,

337
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.030
the individual reader forget the fact that our study

338
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.199
even had it been done correctly, would have been

339
00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:40.170
talking about a decomposition of population level variants in

340
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.199
the popular book which, you know, is signed off

341
00:17:43.209 --> 00:17:46.630
on by Doctor Levski and nobody else, it says

342
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.520
this is yours to guide and that is simply

343
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.339
deceptive, that is simply deceptive because the, the paper

344
00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:55.859
itself, even if the paper were absolutely true. And

345
00:17:55.869 --> 00:17:57.250
I mean, this is another problem we have with

346
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.280
popular science where we, we publish one study and

347
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.050
that then becomes the total truth that we can

348
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.109
build huge narratives around in a, in a what

349
00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:08.199
I call glad well, organization process. But even if

350
00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:10.020
that were the case, that isn't even what the

351
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.800
paper said. Mhm. And, and, and, and so that,

352
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.880
that, that, that, that paper is part of, um

353
00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:21.619
I think we're obliged to think of words that,

354
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.130
that remind you of the phrase military industrial complex.

355
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.719
So, I don't know if we say psychological marketing

356
00:18:26.729 --> 00:18:30.140
comp um complex, but it's part of the uh

357
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.780
the airport book world in which a top scientist

358
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.250
from a top university shows you how you can

359
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.829
hack your life with real science. Tm. And then

360
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.189
when you go and look at the real science.

361
00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:51.010
Tm. Um, IT'S somewhere between, uh misrepresented, wasn't very

362
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.780
good in the first place or outright fraudulent in

363
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.310
a great many of the cases. Mhm.

364
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.209
A and something that you reference there was this

365
00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:07.140
sort of global happiness surveys that we get from

366
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:13.170
time to time. I mean, how much useful information

367
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.000
do you think we can really get from them

368
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.339
in terms of actually uh trying to understand if

369
00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:24.510
people in a particular country and then comparing across

370
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.469
different countries are really happier or sad. It's

371
00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:31.900
difficult because so this is, we're talking about a

372
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.030
thing called the World Happiness Survey that there are

373
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.790
others. But the, the big one is the World

374
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.800
Happiness survey. And basically it's, it's done once a

375
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.599
year and they go and ask people a one

376
00:19:40.609 --> 00:19:44.329
item question and it's uh on, on a, on

377
00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:46.750
a ladder where zero is the worst life possible.

378
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.829
And 10 is the absolutely ideal life you could

379
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:51.839
lead. Where are you? So it's actually about life

380
00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:56.890
satisfaction. But life satisfaction versus happiness for the purposes

381
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.430
of this conversation, I think we can treat it

382
00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:02.160
as the same. And what happens is um well,

383
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.510
there are several narratives that get repeated every year.

384
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.489
One of them is that the Scandinavian countries are

385
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.550
happiest in the world and they usually are usually

386
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.959
uh Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland will. Uh Finland

387
00:20:13.969 --> 00:20:16.030
is not a Scandinavian country. Please don't write in

388
00:20:16.244 --> 00:20:19.484
listeners um will come out in the top four

389
00:20:19.494 --> 00:20:20.734
of the top five and everyone will say, oh,

390
00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:23.354
these co well, you could argue they're kind of

391
00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:27.425
one country, they're all fairly homogeneous culturally. Again, please

392
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.854
don't write in. But, you know, uh and so

393
00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:33.474
if, if tomorrow Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland got

394
00:20:33.484 --> 00:20:35.145
together and said, we are going to form the

395
00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:38.224
Nordic Union, you know, maybe including Iceland and the

396
00:20:38.234 --> 00:20:42.349
Faroe Islands. Um uh We could, they would be

397
00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:43.849
one country and all of a sudden three others

398
00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:45.339
would move into the top 10 cos one of

399
00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:47.939
the problems with the top 10 countries is that

400
00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:50.040
countries are a pretty arbitrary way of defining the

401
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.439
world. You know, you might find that the Marshall

402
00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:56.319
Islands, you know, ev if everyone in the Marshall

403
00:20:56.329 --> 00:20:57.739
Islands, sort of, you know, that if they only

404
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.890
interview 50 people and they all say nine, go,

405
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.660
oh my God. The Marshall Islands are the happiest

406
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.829
country. Let's all rush to the Marshall Islands and

407
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.930
find out what they're doing. You see this with

408
00:21:05.939 --> 00:21:09.599
education uh a few years ago, uh um Sweden

409
00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:11.359
was top of most of the education leagues and

410
00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:12.520
everyone had to go and say, oh, what are

411
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.329
we? We should copy the Swedish model and the

412
00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.329
New York Times and all those papers would have

413
00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:18.099
a thing to say. Here's what daily life looks

414
00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.939
like in a Swedish school and, you know, compare

415
00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:22.209
that with the US. And then one year Finland

416
00:21:22.219 --> 00:21:25.400
came top. Finland got like half of, half of,

417
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.829
yeah. 0.01 ahead of Sweden. Uh OH my God.

418
00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.449
What are the Fins? And it turns out Finland

419
00:21:30.459 --> 00:21:33.560
and Sweden have very different education systems. But now

420
00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:35.130
we all have to sort of say, oh, we,

421
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.599
and we've gone to, you know, various journalists, got

422
00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:40.939
a, you know, uh um flights to Lapland round

423
00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:43.099
about Christmas with their kids, interviewed a few school

424
00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:45.400
teachers. Yeah, there's, and the Finnish model in Swedish

425
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.810
were both completely different, but they were both in

426
00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:51.040
all. So there is this element and any time

427
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.849
you see a top 10 list of countries, it's

428
00:21:54.859 --> 00:21:59.150
immediately meaningless because there's nothing wrong with being the

429
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.270
fifth best country out of 100 and 93 un

430
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.619
member countries. You're probably doing pretty well. Mhm. You're

431
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.880
probably doing pretty well. So one of the narratives

432
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.469
is that Finland is fantastic. Therefore, we should all

433
00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:14.689
embrace social democracy. Capitalism is bad. The US and

434
00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:19.140
the UK are generally about 13th or 14th. But

435
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.180
because we decided to look at the top 10

436
00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:24.089
and Australia's usually in there as well. Australia is,

437
00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:26.260
you know, this is capitalist a country as, as

438
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.660
the US or, or, or the UK. So there,

439
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.239
it, it basically enables people to tell stories. Then

440
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.140
you can say, oh, last year the US was

441
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.930
13th, this year it's 16th. That must be due

442
00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:39.699
to Trump or that must be due to Biden

443
00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:42.650
or that must. Nah, it's just, just, just sampling

444
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.619
error. These countries are all, people are all going

445
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:51.520
7.97 0.8327 0.841. You know, th this, this doesn't

446
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.170
mean that something radical happened now. Yes, if your

447
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.209
country goes from 6 to 4, like what happened

448
00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:59.510
to Greece, you might go. Hm. There's a problem,

449
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.209
but we didn't need the World Happiness Survey to

450
00:23:02.219 --> 00:23:04.400
tell us that there was a problem in Greece.

451
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.010
So it didn't add anything. We would have been

452
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.229
amazed if it hadn't, if they hadn't got less

453
00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:11.510
happy. If, if, if Greece had had the same

454
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.680
numbers in 2014 as 2005, we would have gone.

455
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.310
They're pretty resilient people. Their country's been completely buffered

456
00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:22.619
about unemployment, went up to whatever it did. You

457
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.489
know, the ATM S weren't working. So that's the,

458
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.229
the, the first problem is if it, if any

459
00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:31.510
change, any small change is likely to be noise

460
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.550
and any big change, you're gonna already know about

461
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.410
anyone. The other problem is it doesn't take into

462
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.130
account the fact that culturally, well, how you answer

463
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.209
a question on the scale of 0 to 10

464
00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:47.180
is going to be quite different. Um, IF I

465
00:23:47.189 --> 00:23:50.550
can be a stereotypical brit for a moment, it's

466
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.300
quite hard. At least the, the view that people

467
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.839
have of the Brits is they're not likely to

468
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:04.329
say 10. Um, THERE is this, you know, and

469
00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:08.010
again, this, this may be a stereotyping. I am

470
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.410
a brit. So it's not racist but, you know,

471
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.219
this could be a thing. Oh, yeah, they're quite

472
00:24:11.229 --> 00:24:14.709
money. And whereas one might imagine that the American,

473
00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:19.760
yeah. USA number 110, I'm 10. And you can

474
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.709
invent all kinds of stories around that about why

475
00:24:22.719 --> 00:24:25.180
people might say 10 and, and what their culture

476
00:24:25.189 --> 00:24:27.319
has to say about when you're interviewed in the

477
00:24:27.329 --> 00:24:29.550
street by somebody and you don't know them and

478
00:24:29.739 --> 00:24:33.099
et cetera, uh you can imagine that in some

479
00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:37.410
nondemocratic countries that perhaps people are, um, might be

480
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.869
less happy than they say they are. But want

481
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.780
to know, you know, it's like, oh, ok, who's,

482
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.260
who's asking? Oh, you're not from the government. Well,

483
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.489
that's what someone from the government would say. I'm

484
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.829
10. I'm very happy with our comrade leader. So,

485
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.500
you know, all of those things now that you

486
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.329
can kind of compare year on year, I guess.

487
00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:58.910
But as I say, the small changes are gonna

488
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.160
be noise and the big changes you're probably gonna

489
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.640
predict to them anyway. So essentially it's a way

490
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:09.859
of it provides fodder for filling column inches uh

491
00:25:09.869 --> 00:25:11.979
in newspapers and that may not have been the

492
00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:15.739
intention. And maybe there is some serious social science

493
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.699
that can go on behind that. But by and

494
00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:23.079
large it, it's like university rankings if you, uh

495
00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:25.829
if you sort of, uh even big countries tend,

496
00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:27.250
I don't know whether Portugal does it, but big

497
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.540
countries, you have a thing, like what are the

498
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.709
best universities and what will happen is um they

499
00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:36.880
rank you on about 25 considerations. And so even

500
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:42.040
if you are the 84th best university overall, on

501
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.209
some measure that we don't know. But let's, you

502
00:25:44.219 --> 00:25:46.810
know, uh, Paul Meal, the great psychologist talked about

503
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:49.920
someone called omniscient Jones who knew the actual value

504
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:53.319
of the parameter. Uh, AND, uh, let's say your

505
00:25:53.329 --> 00:25:56.030
university is actually the 84th best out of 100

506
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.030
in the country. It's probably going to be in

507
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.729
the top 10 on one of those measures. And

508
00:26:02.739 --> 00:26:05.199
so you could put, you know, university of wherever

509
00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:09.000
we're in the top 10 on, um, student experience

510
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.939
brackets, outdoor sports or something like that. And if

511
00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:16.349
you aren't in the top 10, you will have

512
00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:19.910
gone, you will have improved 25 places on one

513
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.709
of these measures and you go, the results are

514
00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:25.959
out, we improve 25 places on student experience, indoor

515
00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:30.699
sports. Congratulations. Every, everybody and, you know, all have

516
00:26:30.709 --> 00:26:33.900
won and all must have prizes. But guess what?

517
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.219
People are still applying to Oxford and Cambridge. Yeah.

518
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.229
No, you know, that this is also funny because

519
00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:45.280
uh uh it came to mind that uh also

520
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.630
sort of loosely related to this happiness surveys. Then

521
00:26:50.719 --> 00:26:54.079
of course, you can also market and sell those

522
00:26:54.089 --> 00:26:59.109
books where people find uh culture, uh uh some

523
00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:04.150
sort of culturally contained, let's say a concepts surrounding

524
00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:08.025
the lifestyle and happiness. Like for example, in Japan,

525
00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:12.255
the Iki guy and in Denmark hike or, or

526
00:27:12.584 --> 00:27:15.375
h or however you pronounce it and, and then,

527
00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:17.625
oh my God, you just have to do this

528
00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.354
and you will be happy

529
00:27:19.364 --> 00:27:22.224
forever. And then, and so you spend two years

530
00:27:22.234 --> 00:27:24.155
buying all the ike guy stuff and then that

531
00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:25.724
doesn't work. So then you go and buy all

532
00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:27.194
the hugger shit and then you buy whatever the

533
00:27:27.204 --> 00:27:29.474
Swedish stuff is and you've got this house full

534
00:27:29.484 --> 00:27:32.920
of crap. Um Yeah, I mean, the point is

535
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.420
that a lot of people have outsourced their thinking

536
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.760
about their happiness to experts and while that's a

537
00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.239
sensible thing to do on things like, um you

538
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:50.180
know, cancer and blood pressure, um I, I would

539
00:27:50.189 --> 00:27:54.160
argue personally and II, I never thought about this

540
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.810
until I got into psychology. But I mean, why

541
00:27:57.819 --> 00:28:02.430
do we even, why do we have psychiatrists? Why,

542
00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:06.140
you know, why do we have psychiatrists for many

543
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.650
conditions that are really just about being human? You

544
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.839
know, obviously, if you have some kind of neurological

545
00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:15.949
disorder, uh if, and, and you know, I'm sure

546
00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:18.300
things like schizophrenia and things like that have some

547
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:24.140
kind of biological basis. But uh we've, we started

548
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.739
off with that and then we kind of ended

549
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:29.719
up medicalising everything and, and it, which is ironic,

550
00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:32.780
cos um positive psychology likes to think that it's

551
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.130
not about the medicalization of everything. But uh though

552
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.880
II I um bit of a plug, but it

553
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.550
won't sell many copies. I edited a book on

554
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.729
which we call critical positive psychology. And there was

555
00:28:45.739 --> 00:28:48.469
an excellent chapter in there saying, well, positive psychology

556
00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:51.699
claims to reject the medical model, but look what

557
00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:54.069
they're doing. And in fact, you know, part of

558
00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:56.540
the medical model is I am an expert. You're

559
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.680
not. If you give me some money, I will

560
00:28:58.689 --> 00:29:00.390
treat you. And again, I don't have a problem

561
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.709
with that with the person who, you know, fixes

562
00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:05.989
my cardiac arrhythmia. But uh so I think a

563
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.349
lot of people imagine that they must, they don't,

564
00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:12.829
they know that they don't know very much, you

565
00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.229
know, nobody knows very much about it. Even the

566
00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:18.219
kind of philosophers of happiness over the years acknowledged

567
00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:20.939
they didn't really know much about it. But we

568
00:29:20.949 --> 00:29:23.790
imagine that there must be experts that we can,

569
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.069
if we can just give them some money, then

570
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.280
they will fix that problem in the same way

571
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.550
that they fixed our ingrowing toenail. And um so

572
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.020
there is this huge market for that and, and

573
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.589
it, it's interesting when Positive psychology was launched, it

574
00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:40.930
was very much um it was with an attack

575
00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:43.689
on the people at the, the softer end of

576
00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:47.810
psychology, the, the humanistic psychologists because, and it blamed

577
00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:50.119
them for the fact that the all the self

578
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.140
help books are about, you know, the secret and

579
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.819
your inner child and, you know, assorted bullshit. Uh

580
00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:58.920
And, but there was an element of jealousy there

581
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.189
in that, uh those books sell and make a

582
00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:05.339
lot of money and, and most of the leading

583
00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:09.140
positive psychologists have one or two New York Times

584
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.660
best selling books based on their research and the

585
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.630
research of their fellow uh positive psychologists. And the

586
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.589
research isn't always all that great. And then at

587
00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:19.800
that point, how much of a difference is there?

588
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.910
Um PARTICULARLY because, and I think this is a

589
00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:26.449
studying also in, in, in psycho a wider psychology.

590
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.770
There's a certain kind of psychologist that you meet.

591
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.250
When you go to a psychology faculty, there are

592
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.020
the ones who are absolutely interested in, in measuring

593
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.439
this and cognitive performance and, and, and the determinants

594
00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:44.030
of depression. And then there are others who've basically

595
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.349
got a theory that they want the world to

596
00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:51.310
listen to and they're in order for the world

597
00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:52.790
to listen to them. OK, I've gotta go and

598
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.550
dig up some data, but they're, they're not kind

599
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.530
of going into the lab every morning in full

600
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.750
Richard Feynman mode trying to, trying to disprove their

601
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.510
theory. Um These people tend to be quite charismatic,

602
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.560
they tend to do good presentations. Um, AND they're

603
00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:15.550
clearly on some kind of mission, excuse me. And

604
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.420
now if sometimes that gets attacked as, you know,

605
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.819
some sort of lefty socialist mission or occasionally, you

606
00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:25.380
know, even some right wing mission on intelligence and

607
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.599
things like that. But in general, it's not really

608
00:31:27.609 --> 00:31:29.790
a political thing. It's much more a sort of

609
00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:32.579
be in their bonnet that they're right, they know

610
00:31:32.589 --> 00:31:36.209
that this is, you know, a solution and often

611
00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:38.780
they've come to that out of a very sincere

612
00:31:39.349 --> 00:31:42.260
desire to confront either their own issues or issues

613
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.420
in their family. Um You know, I want to

614
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.199
know, I um people who research suicide, for example,

615
00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:51.020
a lot of people who research suicide have a,

616
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.479
you know, sibling or parent who, who kill themselves

617
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.290
and it's very difficult, it's incredibly difficult to critique

618
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.410
suicide research. You know, a lot of suicide research

619
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.689
is terrible but you can't, it's very hard to

620
00:32:06.699 --> 00:32:10.010
go to suicide research and say stop doing this

621
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.479
and be well, why do you not care about

622
00:32:12.489 --> 00:32:16.780
suicide? Really, really hard. So, yeah, there is, it

623
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.109
seems to me there are a lot of, of,

624
00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:22.650
of psychologists whose they're more about the communication about

625
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.479
the ideas than they are about the scientific side

626
00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:29.209
of it that, you know, treating it as if

627
00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:32.229
it was uh a biomedical science where you collect

628
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:34.219
data and do the analysis and draw the graphs

629
00:32:34.229 --> 00:32:36.349
and say, look, this is, this is really happening.

630
00:32:36.609 --> 00:32:39.280
Um, AND I, I don't know, I, if people

631
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.500
are watching this, who work in psychology departments, they

632
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.489
may be nodding along going. Yeah, I have colleagues

633
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.069
who, for whom the research is kind of secondary,

634
00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:49.280
not in any sort of fraudulent way, but they

635
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.410
are, they're kind of special people, not in a

636
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.050
science nerd, kind of a way. Um, YOU know,

637
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.959
they may be very spiritual individuals, et cetera and

638
00:32:59.969 --> 00:33:01.920
that's great, but it's quite difficult to be very

639
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.609
spiritual, to be a really, really, really good psychologist.

640
00:33:05.619 --> 00:33:08.170
You have to be extremely good at maths and

641
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:13.060
extremely good with people. That's, that's a rare combination

642
00:33:13.069 --> 00:33:14.459
of skills.

643
00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:18.609
Uh So I I mean, it seems that there's

644
00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:23.500
also this sort of element of uh potentially getting

645
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.939
some social and moral backlash if you're trying to

646
00:33:27.949 --> 00:33:32.400
critique some of these research, you mentioned suicide research

647
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.359
there, for example, I mean, so some of these

648
00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:40.000
research when it comes to particularly very sensitive social

649
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:45.670
topics is sort of v from criticism.

650
00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:50.930
Well, also because the majority of people who research,

651
00:33:50.939 --> 00:33:55.430
let's say a politically sensitive topic typically start out

652
00:33:55.439 --> 00:33:59.160
from a political point of view on that. So

653
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:06.050
the majority of people who research police racism start

654
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.330
off, I think from the point of view that

655
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.188
there is a lot of police racism. Um THE

656
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.360
majority of people who look for race differences in

657
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:22.449
IQ probably start off from the idea that certain

658
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:29.958
groups are less intelligent than others um, and most

659
00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.300
people, yeah, you're not going to go into that

660
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.060
topic unless you're somewhat motivated to do it. And

661
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.889
so if it is a political topic, you're probably

662
00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:40.570
going to have an, a priori political position. Now,

663
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.389
maybe there are people who go along and have

664
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:47.860
epiphanies, uh, along the way. But it's very difficult

665
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.239
when you come to, um, an entrenched, when you

666
00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.110
come with a, you know, an entrenched a priori

667
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.820
political position. It's very difficult to, to accept, um,

668
00:34:56.648 --> 00:35:02.409
contrary, uh, empirical evidence. Um Michael Shermer had a

669
00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:04.739
book called Why People Believe weird things. And one

670
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.659
of the things he said is, uh, people believe

671
00:35:06.669 --> 00:35:08.669
or smart people. They, well, one of the chapters

672
00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:10.909
is why the smart people believe weird things. And

673
00:35:10.919 --> 00:35:13.280
he said, well, the thing is smart people are

674
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.929
very good at unders justifying why they believe the

675
00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:19.899
weird things in the first place. But they've still

676
00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:22.360
got to get the weird things kind of out

677
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.790
of it. If you look at smart people who

678
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800
are very religious and, and who are religious in

679
00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.330
the religion of their parents, you know, we all,

680
00:35:31.469 --> 00:35:33.399
you know, we're pretty, we all know that the

681
00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:35.250
chance that the religion of our parents is the

682
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.199
right one. You know, certainly any sort of, you

683
00:35:37.209 --> 00:35:39.979
know, anyone with a logical and scientific brain should

684
00:35:39.989 --> 00:35:43.159
realize that any, that the chance that the religion

685
00:35:43.169 --> 00:35:45.689
that your parents happen to inculcate in you is

686
00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:49.699
the right one. It's fairly small. Um And then,

687
00:35:49.709 --> 00:35:53.679
but you see, you know, orthodox Jewish, orthodox Jewish

688
00:35:53.689 --> 00:35:57.090
particle physicists who are kind of discussing the, you

689
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.820
know, the finest points of detail in the world.

690
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.780
But they uh uh I, I saw one such

691
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.310
person being interviewed but she wasn't mixing pans with

692
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.729
like milk and meat or something and, and, you

693
00:36:06.739 --> 00:36:09.580
know, ditto for any other religion. Certainly not to

694
00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:13.840
um say anything about the uh uh Jewishness. But

695
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.919
if you're going to be have that, if you're

696
00:36:15.929 --> 00:36:18.219
going to say, as I, as a scientist, I

697
00:36:18.229 --> 00:36:19.780
am, you know, objective about the, you know, oh,

698
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.320
and by the way, I have this corner with

699
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.840
religion, which I mean, maybe they try to defend

700
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.600
with the religion objectively. But I think most people

701
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.639
who are religious will say, ok, that's outside the,

702
00:36:27.649 --> 00:36:32.979
that's outside that box. Um You're already kind of,

703
00:36:32.989 --> 00:36:36.159
to some extent justifying why you're, you know, you're

704
00:36:36.169 --> 00:36:38.100
not looking at that. I, I'm not certain if

705
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.550
I'm making quite good sense here. But, um, people

706
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.760
are, yeah, people justify themselves into that position and,

707
00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:48.959
um, it's hard to get out of it and

708
00:36:48.969 --> 00:36:52.830
it will take a lot more, um, it'll take

709
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.409
a lot more co contradictory evidence before you start

710
00:36:56.419 --> 00:37:00.219
believing the opposite of your initial hypothesis, particularly if

711
00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:02.500
it was the entire basis of you going into

712
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.409
that field in the first place. Uh Very few

713
00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:11.620
people make that transition. I'm thinking of um Hilda

714
00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:17.199
Bastian, a science writer. And she started off as

715
00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:19.719
I think she may have been anti vaccine, she

716
00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:24.060
was anti something. Um IT may have been anti

717
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:28.389
vaccine, anti some kind of medical procedure. Uh AND

718
00:37:28.399 --> 00:37:31.389
she went and read the evidence and she realized

719
00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:34.389
that the evidence was actually true. And now she

720
00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:39.590
writes about um deniers, well, first of all about

721
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.209
bad scientists, which is great, but also from the

722
00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:45.639
point of view of someone who's, you know, started

723
00:37:45.649 --> 00:37:49.879
off believing a lot of bad science. Um And

724
00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:51.909
she's an absolute beacon from that point of view

725
00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:54.370
because she actually did the, she crossed the line,

726
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.709
she crossed the line and will, I'm sure would

727
00:37:56.719 --> 00:37:59.590
tell you, interview her, do interview her Hilda Basket.

728
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.169
She'd be a fantastic interview. She would tell you.

729
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.600
Uh Yeah, you know, I used to believe this

730
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.590
and here's why and most of us who've been,

731
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.229
most of us have been lifelong. Most scientists have

732
00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:13.520
been lifelong scientists. We haven't had to undergo that

733
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.010
conversion. We can't tell you what it was like

734
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.750
the day when we realized that Chem Trails couldn't

735
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.610
be real. Um So people who've been through that

736
00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.610
journey, I think uh uh but they are, they

737
00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.330
are few and far between and, and even more.

738
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.330
So when you've made a public position and when

739
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.610
you're, you've got a book deal, you know, you,

740
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.530
you've got a book deal, you've maybe you might

741
00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.379
have written two or three or four popular Bestselling

742
00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:41.469
books on YX is the way to lose weight,

743
00:38:41.479 --> 00:38:46.639
become happy all of that. And even if just

744
00:38:46.649 --> 00:38:49.199
in those moments before the, before you fall asleep,

745
00:38:49.209 --> 00:38:51.489
you have a little bit of a doubt, you're

746
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.610
probably not gonna co um phone your publisher and

747
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.820
say Pulp the lot. I just realized it's garbage.

748
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.949
Yeah. So uh uh still on the topic of

749
00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:10.919
well being, I would also like to hear a

750
00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:15.040
little bit about your critique of another study in

751
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.969
this case by Frederickson at all, uh uh uh

752
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:24.959
work on the relationship between genomics and well-being because

753
00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:28.550
at a certain point there, you also mentioned that,

754
00:39:28.879 --> 00:39:31.899
I mean, there could be, or there might be

755
00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:35.469
some sort of genetic basis to this to some

756
00:39:35.479 --> 00:39:37.659
extent. But in the, in the, in the case

757
00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:42.280
of that particular study, what would you find as

758
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:47.100
the main a conceptual and statistical?

759
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.850
Yeah, this was, this was quite the, this was

760
00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.010
quite the uh quite the study. Um Frederickson presented

761
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.830
it at a conference with a um a picture

762
00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.219
of a couple of the charts, one of them

763
00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:57.540
going one way and one of them going the

764
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.979
other way for the, the two conditions. Uh And

765
00:39:59.989 --> 00:40:02.030
the uh the title of the slide was an

766
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.500
objective basis for moral philosophy question mark which um

767
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.979
there, there were two main problems uh with this

768
00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:11.610
study and I presume you'll put the reference in

769
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.239
the notes. Um The first was that it was

770
00:40:15.899 --> 00:40:18.000
it was about the sixth or seventh study that

771
00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:22.820
the s last author had produced, using a way

772
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:28.729
of analyzing uh data which is completely invalid. He

773
00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:32.479
basically made up his own statistical method and this

774
00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:35.080
method is going to lead to large numbers of

775
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.100
false positives. Uh And I, I've cried, I predicted

776
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.530
another paper where someone had done something similar and

777
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.669
they, and they replied, but we replicated it. It's

778
00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:48.629
like, yes, because your, your method reliably produces large

779
00:40:48.639 --> 00:40:52.689
numbers of false positives. Um So that was the,

780
00:40:52.699 --> 00:40:55.750
the first problem is the method was nonsense. Um

781
00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.840
An even bigger problem, however, was that when they

782
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.229
were coding up the data, uh they decided that

783
00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:07.870
they, they collected data on people with this rather

784
00:41:07.879 --> 00:41:11.909
strange American way of collecting race. So uh Amer

785
00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:16.909
the the US US scientists used the census definition

786
00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:22.090
of race from about 1910. And in the 1910

787
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.989
US census, there was black, white, uh native American

788
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:34.290
Asian, which kind of meant Japanese immigrant, uh Hawaiian

789
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.129
and Pacific Islander. Now, clearly those are not, you

790
00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:40.129
know, in any way representative of, of, of, of

791
00:41:40.139 --> 00:41:43.409
the human population. But OK, there was Hawaii and

792
00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:45.090
there was Guam. So we kind of had to

793
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.540
include them. There isn't, for example, a code for

794
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.830
Hispanic and Hispanic is orthogonal to race and you

795
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.540
can be black Hispanic or white Hispanic. So uh

796
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:57.729
and nobody dares touch these now because obviously to

797
00:41:57.739 --> 00:41:59.699
try and re you know, reconstruct that would be

798
00:41:59.709 --> 00:42:03.149
just a political nightmare. Anyway, they collected these data

799
00:42:03.889 --> 00:42:06.550
and either they didn't get a significant result, but

800
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.219
for whatever reason, they decided to recode them as

801
00:42:09.229 --> 00:42:12.840
white and not white. So instead of white being

802
00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.969
one and all the others being 23456, they just

803
00:42:15.979 --> 00:42:18.149
had uh white is one and everything else is

804
00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:20.379
zero. And they must have done this by hand

805
00:42:20.389 --> 00:42:22.350
because they left a four in. So they had

806
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.110
all these ones, all these zeros and a four.

807
00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:28.810
And they then used that without noticing as a

808
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.379
binary variable in a regression. And basically, if they

809
00:42:33.389 --> 00:42:35.479
held all ones and zeros, it wouldn't have mattered

810
00:42:35.489 --> 00:42:37.100
if they'd been ones and zeros or fours and

811
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.770
twos. But as soon as you have three values

812
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.600
for what should be a binary variable in your

813
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.639
aggression, they actually start behaving like real numbers. So

814
00:42:45.649 --> 00:42:49.169
we discovered this and we found that. So again,

815
00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:52.090
let's pretend that the method isn't full of statistical

816
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.699
artifacts. Let's pretend that the method is correct. Even

817
00:42:55.709 --> 00:43:01.340
with that method. When you corrected this incorrectly coded

818
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:07.219
person, the main effect of the study reversed. Hm.

819
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.399
Did it reverse or did it halve or both?

820
00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:14.139
Anyway, it was drastically altered simply by changing that

821
00:43:14.149 --> 00:43:20.199
one data plot. So we wrote this up in

822
00:43:20.209 --> 00:43:25.919
our rebuttal. And what happened was the authors. So

823
00:43:25.929 --> 00:43:27.879
we said to people, but if you download this

824
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:29.780
file from this gene database and you run their

825
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.489
code. This is what will happen and look, here's

826
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:37.060
that form. The authors took that data file, corrected

827
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.669
the four and re uploaded it. They didn't tell

828
00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:42.669
anyone, they didn't put a note on it. They

829
00:43:42.679 --> 00:43:45.159
didn't tell us and they didn't tell the journal.

830
00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.110
So now anyone who downloads it will go. Well,

831
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.250
what's this brown sl what are they talking about?

832
00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:56.060
The results are? Um So yeah, a combination of

833
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:59.919
the method was completely wrong and there were errors

834
00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:03.439
in the data. Um And so the whole thing

835
00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:07.909
was just nonsense, just complete nonsense. Uh But you

836
00:44:07.919 --> 00:44:10.129
know, it took quite, it took, it took many,

837
00:44:10.139 --> 00:44:13.159
many hours and days of dredging through. You know,

838
00:44:13.169 --> 00:44:16.459
the data file is like 35 megabytes or something.

839
00:44:16.949 --> 00:44:19.560
It's complete genomic analysis and then all these variables

840
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.310
that go along with it. So, yeah, the method

841
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.379
was wrong and they hadn't even implemented the method

842
00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:29.409
correctly. Uh We wrote to the editors and said,

843
00:44:29.419 --> 00:44:31.610
we really think you ought to retract this paper.

844
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.459
It's based on, you know, we can argue about

845
00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:38.100
whether the method. Yeah, it, it is full of

846
00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.939
artifacts. Here are several statisticians who will tell you

847
00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:43.439
it is. But OK, that's a scientific argument. But

848
00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.760
the data had this error in it and when

849
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.080
you correct it, the, the effect goes away. Um

850
00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.770
And the authors tried to sneak a new version

851
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.360
of the data past you and the um the

852
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.379
editor refused to uh to consider it. So when

853
00:44:57.389 --> 00:44:59.389
he got fired a couple of years later for

854
00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:01.840
some me too stuff, uh, I, we were, I

855
00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:05.739
was quite pleased. But, um, yeah, so that's, and,

856
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.360
and that was an interesting example but an entirely

857
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:12.699
typical example of how science doesn't get corrected because

858
00:45:13.129 --> 00:45:14.669
in the same way that if you've got a

859
00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:17.409
theory and you're committed to it, it's embarrassing to

860
00:45:17.419 --> 00:45:19.189
come back for it. It's very embarrassing for a

861
00:45:19.199 --> 00:45:21.040
journal edit to, to admit that they published a,

862
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.229
a garbage paper, uh, with, with data errors in

863
00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:26.250
it that, that completely trashed the results. So they

864
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.100
just pretend it didn't happen and hope no one

865
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:28.600
will notice.

866
00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:32.540
Mhm. But, but when it comes to the statistical

867
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:37.840
analysis that were applied in this particular study, since

868
00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.340
we're talking about genetics here, do you find that

869
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:46.179
perhaps some of the issues would also extend to

870
00:45:46.189 --> 00:45:49.580
other genetics research or

871
00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.639
you'd have to talk to a genetics researcher? Um,

872
00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:57.830
I do know that, um, about 15 years ago

873
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:02.060
there were problems because people were attempting to identify

874
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.050
which gene was responsible for this or that phenomenon,

875
00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:10.360
uh, by basically, uh testing 35,000 genes, uh, and

876
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:12.909
seeing which of them were associated with an outcome

877
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.179
without making the necessary statistical corrections. And so they

878
00:46:17.189 --> 00:46:21.899
were generating huge amounts of, um, of, of false,

879
00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:24.060
false positives. But you'd have to talk to somebody

880
00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:25.699
who knows a lot more than me about genetic

881
00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:27.179
research. I, I had to do quite a lot

882
00:46:27.189 --> 00:46:29.120
of learning in, in quite a hurry for that

883
00:46:29.129 --> 00:46:31.260
paper and I've forgotten most of it now.

884
00:46:33.159 --> 00:46:37.889
OK. So let's move on from uh happiness and

885
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.969
well being here because I, I would also like

886
00:46:40.979 --> 00:46:45.330
to get into another paper, this one from 2015

887
00:46:45.439 --> 00:46:50.750
by Thorstenson Pastor and Elliot. Where, I mean, uh

888
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.520
th this is very interesting and funny in a

889
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.179
way, I guess they sort of offered evidence from

890
00:46:58.189 --> 00:47:02.820
two experiments that perception of colors and in this

891
00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.709
case, it was on the blue, yellow axis was

892
00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:09.939
impaired if the participants have watched the sad movie

893
00:47:09.949 --> 00:47:11.469
clip. Compared

894
00:47:11.489 --> 00:47:14.939
to part, if you're feeling blue, you can't see

895
00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:16.090
blue or something.

896
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.419
Yeah. And this was compared to participants who watched

897
00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:25.209
clips designed to induce a happy or neutral mood.

898
00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:29.129
So, what were the main issues, methodologically speaking here?

899
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:32.570
Um I, I, I've always been surprised that that,

900
00:47:33.189 --> 00:47:34.550
well, I mean, I presume this, I think this

901
00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.649
is done with undergraduates. I've always been surprised that

902
00:47:36.659 --> 00:47:39.129
um undergraduates who have been watching four hours of

903
00:47:39.139 --> 00:47:42.929
TV, since per day, since they were four years

904
00:47:42.939 --> 00:47:46.959
old. Um So they've probably watched 20,000 hours of

905
00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:50.389
television. And apparently psychologists believe that if you show

906
00:47:50.399 --> 00:47:52.689
them a mildly sad or a mildly funny clip

907
00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:54.399
for about six minutes that they will all of

908
00:47:54.409 --> 00:47:56.379
a sudden be in some kind of, you know,

909
00:47:56.389 --> 00:47:58.570
happy or sad mood. But apparently we have to

910
00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.320
stipulate that we have to accept that um the

911
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.590
bigger problem in this study is that the uh

912
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.199
the results were fabricated. So uh there's not really

913
00:48:07.209 --> 00:48:09.300
a lot of point in going any further. Um

914
00:48:09.379 --> 00:48:11.300
The editor of the adjourn at the time is

915
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.209
a terrifically nice chap. And he didn't want to

916
00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:14.989
get into too much of a confrontation with the

917
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.280
authors. So um a suitable fig leaf was arranged

918
00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:21.449
in terms of the reason for the retraction, but

919
00:48:21.459 --> 00:48:23.929
it's, it was abundantly obvious if you looked at

920
00:48:23.939 --> 00:48:26.209
the data set that these numbers had been fabricated.

921
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.409
Um So obviously, you can get any result you

922
00:48:29.419 --> 00:48:31.060
like if you just make them, make, make, make

923
00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:37.800
them, make the numbers up. Um So yeah, that

924
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.760
was, that was nice and simple. That was a,

925
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:41.959
that was probably the first case I worked on

926
00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:43.419
where I actually had data in front of me.

927
00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:46.389
And I go, yeah, this is obvious fraudulent.

928
00:48:48.419 --> 00:48:52.129
Yeah. Uh And so uh from the same year

929
00:48:52.139 --> 00:48:56.489
actually, and we're talking about this sort of thing

930
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.610
nowadays, I guess with Twitter and other kinds of

931
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.189
social media. So there was also this study on

932
00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:10.040
how supposedly through Twitter language, uh the authors could

933
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:15.870
reliably predict heart disease. And this was um I

934
00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:18.389
mean the name here is a bit complicated. I

935
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:22.449
stabbed by it all. Yeah. So what, what are

936
00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.260
the criticisms here? And by the way, do you

937
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.830
think that they would extend since I'm mentioning uh

938
00:49:27.919 --> 00:49:30.639
the uh the fact that we still talk a

939
00:49:30.649 --> 00:49:35.110
lot about how much reliable information we can get

940
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.110
from uh, patterns of language and other sorts of

941
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.270
activity on social media. Uh, AB about this or

942
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.074
that kind of issue that we can. So, do

943
00:49:46.084 --> 00:49:50.485
you think that these would apply to other research

944
00:49:50.495 --> 00:49:54.385
using Twitter or other social media? They, no, I

945
00:49:54.395 --> 00:49:54.495
mean,

946
00:49:54.504 --> 00:49:57.304
everything's far too noisy. They were just, they, they,

947
00:49:57.314 --> 00:49:59.905
they ran enough models so that eventually they managed

948
00:49:59.915 --> 00:50:02.524
to model some noise down to a P value

949
00:50:02.534 --> 00:50:06.465
of 0.049. Um And if you get 0.05 someone

950
00:50:06.475 --> 00:50:10.264
will publish it. Uh And uh they, it, yeah,

951
00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:12.850
they, there were all sorts of things wrong with

952
00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.199
that paper at one point. They were, they were

953
00:50:15.209 --> 00:50:18.199
using some reference data. Uh BUT it turned out

954
00:50:18.209 --> 00:50:20.610
that was from Facebook, not from Twitter. And, you

955
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.719
know, Facebook and Twitter populations are different. Um They

956
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:25.939
showed a map of, you know, this area is

957
00:50:25.949 --> 00:50:28.030
close, it looks like that area and it, it

958
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.219
wasn't, there were hundreds of differences but it was

959
00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:35.370
kind of visually impressive. Um And, you know, basically,

960
00:50:35.379 --> 00:50:36.949
uh uh what I was saying earlier, there are

961
00:50:36.959 --> 00:50:40.110
someone, the uh the couple of the people on

962
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.629
that paper have this idea that you can with

963
00:50:43.639 --> 00:50:48.780
machine learning or with big, big linear models d

964
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:52.820
discern trends in extremely noisy data. And the answer

965
00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.810
is you can't, and you know, they, they didn't

966
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.399
realize that their data had been censored somewhat by

967
00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:01.489
Twitter. So they thought they were getting pure data.

968
00:51:01.679 --> 00:51:04.330
Uh, Twitter had taken out a lot of stuff.

969
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.229
So this was about the claim of the study

970
00:51:07.669 --> 00:51:10.429
was not that angry people get heart disease. The

971
00:51:10.439 --> 00:51:14.129
claim of the study was that US counties where

972
00:51:14.139 --> 00:51:18.090
there was more anger expressed on Twitter had higher

973
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.790
rates of heart disease, which would typically be among

974
00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.209
non Twitter users. The data were from like 2011

975
00:51:24.219 --> 00:51:26.320
and 2012 when there weren't that many people on

976
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:29.540
Twitter and the kind of people uh who get,

977
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.659
uh who get uh atherosclerotic heart disease uh tend

978
00:51:32.669 --> 00:51:34.830
not to be on Twitter anyway. But you had

979
00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.239
this idea of an, you know, an angry county

980
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.530
full of, I don't know, rednecks, whatever. Uh And

981
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.469
it turned out, yeah, Twitter was censoring the data.

982
00:51:43.479 --> 00:51:46.419
So there was all kinds of anger related stuff

983
00:51:46.429 --> 00:51:48.810
uh in the data that wasn't in, that wasn't

984
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.199
in, wasn't there that wasn't given to them because

985
00:51:51.209 --> 00:51:54.129
Twitter bowdlerized uh the data, they took some of

986
00:51:54.139 --> 00:51:57.790
the rude words out. Um Then I showed that

987
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.090
if you, um if you, instead of looking for

988
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.350
anger, you looked for upbeat things, but that also

989
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.080
predicted, I can't remember if I said it predicted

990
00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.340
heart disease or if it predicted cancer. But basically,

991
00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:12.649
if you've got enough variables, you know, that if,

992
00:52:12.659 --> 00:52:15.090
if anger is predicting that particular form of heart

993
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.149
disease, well, how many other forms of disease did

994
00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:18.850
they look at and which ones did they choose

995
00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.459
to publish? Uh So it was, it was just

996
00:52:23.469 --> 00:52:25.649
a, it was just flashy nonsense. It was flashy

997
00:52:25.659 --> 00:52:28.560
nonsense but it didn't prove anything at all. Uh

998
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:32.560
But the reviewers of that paper could not possibly

999
00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.139
have understood it. I mean, I, I have a

1000
00:52:35.149 --> 00:52:37.189
degree in computer science and it took me 2.5

1001
00:52:37.199 --> 00:52:39.310
days to download all the stuff that I needed

1002
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.659
to get the model to run. Uh NN none

1003
00:52:42.669 --> 00:52:45.500
of the reviewers ran any of those models to

1004
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:48.070
replicate them. So they would have just gone. Oh,

1005
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.350
there's this big complex computer model. Well, it must

1006
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.909
be right. Well, you know, the model, the model

1007
00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:54.350
could be wrong and I have no way of

1008
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.909
knowing that, but a big complex software model. Uh

1009
00:52:56.919 --> 00:52:58.320
I mean, this is a, this is a uh

1010
00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.080
a more general problem for science is that a

1011
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:01.919
lot of the time, even if you trust that

1012
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:04.120
the people collected the data, you're also trusting that

1013
00:53:04.129 --> 00:53:07.639
their 12,000 lines of code doesn't have any bugs

1014
00:53:07.649 --> 00:53:10.929
in it. Well, you know, your, your, your viewers

1015
00:53:10.939 --> 00:53:13.360
who know a bit about software, maybe uh having

1016
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.439
a bit of a smile at that. Um And

1017
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.959
so, you know, we ran this model and look

1018
00:53:18.969 --> 00:53:20.919
these numbers came out. Can we have a publication

1019
00:53:20.929 --> 00:53:24.010
now, please? Just, you know, and, and as I

1020
00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.179
say, we, I demonstrate, for example, one of the

1021
00:53:27.189 --> 00:53:28.949
things was if you cut the new outage states

1022
00:53:28.959 --> 00:53:31.250
in half, the effect was only present in the

1023
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.560
north of the United, in the south of the

1024
00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.209
United States and not the north or vice versa.

1025
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.179
Well, there's no theoretical reason why angry people in

1026
00:53:39.189 --> 00:53:43.419
your county, north of, of Missouri uh would, would

1027
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.270
cause you to have more heart disease in that

1028
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.250
county and not in the south. And then I

1029
00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.520
found two counties in Indiana that were like next

1030
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.469
to each other and one of them was 10

1031
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.689
times more angry but had half the heart disease.

1032
00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:59.139
So there's no, there's no useful, the, the, the

1033
00:53:59.149 --> 00:54:00.780
the biggest problem with that article was, it was

1034
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:05.429
like claiming that somehow health authorities were going to

1035
00:54:05.439 --> 00:54:08.179
be able to, you know, oh, let's not, you

1036
00:54:08.189 --> 00:54:11.739
know, what's the best predictor of this year's mortality

1037
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.689
from heart disease? And the answer is last year's

1038
00:54:14.699 --> 00:54:19.879
mortality from heart disease, um especially since uh the

1039
00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:23.080
determination of mortality from heart disease is what's written

1040
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.860
on the death certificate. And it turns out there

1041
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:30.120
are enormous differences in medical diagnosing practice based on

1042
00:54:30.219 --> 00:54:34.879
local cultural factors sometimes including whether one particular doctor

1043
00:54:34.889 --> 00:54:36.719
had a big influence. You know, if you're in

1044
00:54:36.729 --> 00:54:39.520
a uh an area with a big city hospital

1045
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.699
and, you know, oh, for the last 50 years

1046
00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:43.840
ever since professor. So and so we, we try

1047
00:54:43.939 --> 00:54:47.159
not to say that it's atherosclerotic heart disease because

1048
00:54:47.169 --> 00:54:49.679
we look for these other more subtle factors or

1049
00:54:49.689 --> 00:54:53.580
vice versa. And So it's all of these extremely

1050
00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.760
noisy measures being thrown into a regression. Eventually something's

1051
00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.550
going to kind of pop out one side or

1052
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.270
the other. Um, AND it, you know, but it,

1053
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.379
it's not useful. Uh But it makes, again, it

1054
00:55:04.389 --> 00:55:08.040
makes, it's a press friendly story. The press likes

1055
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.520
to say, oh, wow, pretty soon we'll be able

1056
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.479
to see whether, you know, you're, you're likely to

1057
00:55:12.489 --> 00:55:14.760
get heart disease based on what, what's, what's being

1058
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.860
tweeted in your neighborhood. Oh, wow. Gee whiz. Um

1059
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:22.270
YOU know, sorry, predicting heart disease was going to

1060
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.229
continue to be um difficult. But the best basis

1061
00:55:27.239 --> 00:55:29.229
we have for it is, you know, what happened

1062
00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:32.340
last year and how much pizza you eat. So

1063
00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.379
and a lot of this is about cute, so

1064
00:55:35.489 --> 00:55:39.270
cute stuff gets published. The thing about, oh Feeling

1065
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.909
Blue makes you see blue or rather not or

1066
00:55:41.919 --> 00:55:46.290
something. Uh And all of these articles get coverage

1067
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.550
in Huffington Post and even in, you know, the

1068
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.489
Daily Mail and even in the Times sometimes, um

1069
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.590
because we've got to generate content and so psychologists

1070
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.520
to some extent can also, or scientists and university

1071
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:04.100
press offices. Uh Although my colleague, Chris Chambers had

1072
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.989
a look at that and determined that the scientists

1073
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.840
aren't always completely. Oh, yes. The press office made

1074
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.100
me do it. No, no. But the press offices

1075
00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:16.000
are producing these, you know, stories uh and feeding

1076
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.300
them to their friendly journalists and scientists at the

1077
00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.530
university of whatever. And then they can go, hey,

1078
00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.239
University of wherever is in the news again with

1079
00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:26.520
our world leading research. So it's all part of

1080
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:31.699
that kind of mutually reinforcing, um, world of, um,

1081
00:56:31.709 --> 00:56:39.060
en entertainment, water cooler discussion. Clicks. It just feeds

1082
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.379
that and, but it's all nonsense. Almost all nonsense.

1083
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.459
So we can't tell what is it?

1084
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:46.969
Ok. So, uh, le let's get a little bit

1085
00:56:46.979 --> 00:56:51.820
more into what might be behind the bad science

1086
00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:54.610
here. I mean, we could have gone through some

1087
00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.790
more studies that you yourself debunked or found flaws

1088
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.479
with. But let's get into some more general questions

1089
00:57:02.489 --> 00:57:05.699
and issues here. So when it comes to perhaps

1090
00:57:05.709 --> 00:57:10.290
having a better understanding of where bad science stems

1091
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.870
from and the factors and do you think that

1092
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:16.580
uh it is better to try to approach it

1093
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:19.449
at an individual level? I mean, is it mostly

1094
00:57:19.459 --> 00:57:25.379
about people, individuals with certain personality or psychological traits

1095
00:57:25.699 --> 00:57:31.050
uh having a tendency to particularly produce fraudulent data

1096
00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:35.070
and studies or is it more a systemic issue?

1097
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.699
And if it's a systemic issue, then we might

1098
00:57:37.709 --> 00:57:41.060
get into some of the main factors here.

1099
00:57:41.669 --> 00:57:43.340
I mean, I think mostly it's an, it's an

1100
00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.580
interaction of the two but the, the, the system,

1101
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:51.750
as it itself, the system itself, the scientific production

1102
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.669
system um you know, exists in an economic context

1103
00:57:57.189 --> 00:58:01.639
and you know, the economists, uh most of them

1104
00:58:01.649 --> 00:58:03.600
who aren't making their data up, but economists can

1105
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.889
tell you if you, if you show an economist

1106
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.959
from Mars, uh, if you describe the system in

1107
00:58:10.979 --> 00:58:14.560
which scientific research takes place, uh, they will tell

1108
00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.360
you exactly what's going to happen, which is that

1109
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:20.790
people are gonna respond to incentives. Um, AND we,

1110
00:58:21.169 --> 00:58:23.399
we have this idea of the scientists as the

1111
00:58:23.409 --> 00:58:28.310
kind of 19th century gentleman Sikh, uh, with, you

1112
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:32.199
know, independently wealthy and, and dabbling in things to,

1113
00:58:32.209 --> 00:58:35.219
you know, to plant species or, you know, the

1114
00:58:35.229 --> 00:58:38.870
odd uh still, you know, seeing if you can

1115
00:58:38.879 --> 00:58:41.760
get chlorine gas out of it or whatever, um

1116
00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.840
uh very much all the sort of, you know,

1117
00:58:45.899 --> 00:58:49.620
the noble, the noble cause of, of advancing human

1118
00:58:49.629 --> 00:58:54.080
knowledge. Um But first and foremost, scientists are employees,

1119
00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:00.179
they are working in an economic system, they need

1120
00:59:00.189 --> 00:59:01.879
to go home at the end of the day

1121
00:59:01.889 --> 00:59:06.340
and put food on the table. Um They worry

1122
00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:10.449
about their career, they worry about uh their visas.

1123
00:59:10.459 --> 00:59:16.199
If they're from another country, they also have normal

1124
00:59:16.209 --> 00:59:20.510
human drives and desires such as prestige, um you

1125
00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:23.800
know, bettering themselves, making a lot of money in

1126
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.739
some cases and the way science is set up

1127
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:32.939
makes it relatively easy if you are prepared to

1128
00:59:32.949 --> 00:59:35.310
be a bad actor to do that. Now, I

1129
00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.969
don't know whether there are, you know, more sociopaths

1130
00:59:38.979 --> 00:59:42.560
or more generally bad people in science than any

1131
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:46.310
other uh domain, you know, like banking or uh

1132
00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.070
you, you quite often read out someone the other

1133
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.899
day on Twitter. I, I had some sympathy with

1134
00:59:50.909 --> 00:59:52.750
them and they, they were trying to sort of

1135
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.179
fill in their expenses from their university and they

1136
00:59:55.189 --> 00:59:58.129
had to jump through hoops to get $30 reimbursed.

1137
00:59:58.389 --> 01:00:00.330
And they said, you know, it always seems to

1138
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.534
be the university administrators themselves who've been creaming tens

1139
01:00:04.544 --> 01:00:06.774
of thousands of dollars a year off the top

1140
01:00:06.824 --> 01:00:09.145
when the scandals come to light. You know, it

1141
01:00:09.155 --> 01:00:11.544
isn't, it isn't the, the research who goes to

1142
01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:14.824
two conferences a year over claiming $40 on a

1143
01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:17.364
taxi ride, that's going to be what, uh, what

1144
01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:23.739
breaks the budget. So, but, um, people, people of

1145
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:27.500
all kinds and all classes and all backgrounds are

1146
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:34.419
exposed to temptations to cheat whether that's professionally financially,

1147
01:00:34.449 --> 01:00:39.469
uh, et cetera. And we shouldn't expect scientists to

1148
01:00:39.479 --> 01:00:41.550
be any different. I sort of give this analogy

1149
01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.820
of, uh, when your university, when it comes to

1150
01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:46.760
the end of the month or the fortnight in

1151
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:47.820
the US when it comes to the end of

1152
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:51.850
the month, uh, you get a payslip, uh, saying,

1153
01:00:52.229 --> 01:00:54.399
you know, your gross pay your net pay after

1154
01:00:54.409 --> 01:00:57.409
tax. And they say, and we've sent this money

1155
01:00:57.419 --> 01:00:59.439
to your bank account. What they don't do is

1156
01:00:59.449 --> 01:01:01.889
say, ok, your net pay after tax is 3.5

1157
01:01:01.899 --> 01:01:05.060
1000 just go along to room 47 and take

1158
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.429
35 €100 bills off the top of the pile.

1159
01:01:10.419 --> 01:01:14.870
They don't know why don't they trust you. Uh

1160
01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:22.320
And yet we allow scientists essentially without any external

1161
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.560
supervision, certainly without any external supervision, you know, of

1162
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.120
the kind that could say stop, you can't do

1163
01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:33.870
that uh to um mark their own homework, decide

1164
01:01:33.879 --> 01:01:37.550
themselves what numbers they're going to present. Um And

1165
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.389
one number will get you a book deal and

1166
01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:44.520
the other number won't. Um YOU know, that's quite

1167
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:47.870
a temptation. You have to be more than averagely

1168
01:01:47.879 --> 01:01:51.899
honest to turn down the prospect of a quarter

1169
01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:55.179
million dollar book deal based on publishing or not

1170
01:01:55.189 --> 01:02:00.979
publishing a result. Um So yeah, we expo we,

1171
01:02:00.989 --> 01:02:03.219
we at the top, I mean, not, not very,

1172
01:02:03.229 --> 01:02:05.219
not many scientists do this, but at the top,

1173
01:02:05.229 --> 01:02:09.040
the rewards are very high and therefore the temptations

1174
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:10.979
are, are are there. But even in the middling

1175
01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:15.790
level, um we see this particularly in China where,

1176
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.070
you know, you've gotta have this amount of publications

1177
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.010
to continue, but it happens in the West too.

1178
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.189
It just seems to be more of a uh

1179
01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.570
and, and so people will pay somebody to write

1180
01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.379
a paper for and then they can say, yes,

1181
01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:30.250
I published this paper and no one's ever gonna

1182
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.810
come along and say so tell, no one's gonna

1183
01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.270
give them a, a spontaneous Viber, no one's gonna

1184
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.250
say so tell me about this. So this variable

1185
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.439
moderates this and they're gonna sit there, they didn't

1186
01:02:39.449 --> 01:02:43.540
write it, they didn't understand it. Um So yeah,

1187
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.939
I say in, in, in particularly China. It's got

1188
01:02:45.949 --> 01:02:48.030
to the point where large numbers of people are

1189
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.070
just having papers written for them. Uh, BUT all

1190
01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.000
over the world you've got all of these do,

1191
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:56.699
um phd candidates and post docs desperate to keep

1192
01:02:56.709 --> 01:02:58.959
their job, keep their visa, et cetera and who

1193
01:02:58.969 --> 01:03:03.199
will do what it takes. And particularly if they're,

1194
01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:05.280
uh, you know, the, the boss of their lab

1195
01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:08.520
who is pretty much God, you know, there's no

1196
01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.780
other sort of appeal, um, tells you to come

1197
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.080
up with, you know, data that show the right

1198
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.360
num the right results. Well, you're gonna give them

1199
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:20.129
that data or you have to leave or you

1200
01:03:20.139 --> 01:03:21.649
have to leave and a lot of people do

1201
01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:26.000
leave, they walk away from science, uh, because they're

1202
01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.899
too disgusted about what they were being asked to

1203
01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:30.129
do, but most of them don't blow the whistle

1204
01:03:30.449 --> 01:03:33.669
on the way out because the bar for doing

1205
01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:37.300
so is very high. The evidentiary bar for proving

1206
01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.810
that somebody committed fraud is very high. And now,

1207
01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.100
as we've seen in, in, in a recent case,

1208
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.060
we've even got somebody credibly accused of fraud and,

1209
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:50.020
and then, um, claiming that it's malicious libel, you

1210
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.870
know, to point out that none of these numbers

1211
01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:55.909
add up. So, um, it's, it, it, you're very

1212
01:03:55.919 --> 01:04:00.399
unlikely to get caught, uh committing scientific misconduct. And

1213
01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:03.360
historically, you've certainly been very unlikely to get caught.

1214
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.270
And so if you're in a situation where you

1215
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.600
have a choice between two options. A and B.

1216
01:04:07.949 --> 01:04:11.139
Uh One of them will either make you rich

1217
01:04:11.149 --> 01:04:14.000
or at least ensure your continuing employment and visa

1218
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.750
and the other won't. Um, AND no one will

1219
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.459
ever find out that you cheated to get to

1220
01:04:19.469 --> 01:04:23.669
this result. Um It doesn't surprise me that a

1221
01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:25.850
lot of people do. That doesn't surprise me at

1222
01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.570
all. I think we would be, it would be

1223
01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:30.149
really weird if, if we discovered that no scientist

1224
01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:32.280
ever did cheat, we would want to sort of

1225
01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:34.520
bottle whatever it is. They've got cos we could

1226
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:38.399
use that with every other aspect of human endeavor,

1227
01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:41.330
you know, politicians, et cetera. Um But, you know,

1228
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.169
it, it's just not the case, it's just not

1229
01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.830
the case, but science is set up and, and

1230
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.820
the popular view of scientists is these rather aloof

1231
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.189
individuals but who we can trust. Trust me. It's

1232
01:04:52.199 --> 01:04:54.709
the science, it's not me saying it, it's the

1233
01:04:54.719 --> 01:04:57.570
science that's saying it. I am merely the, the

1234
01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.750
kind of priest through whom the science is channeled

1235
01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.429
to you. Uh So you have to believe it

1236
01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:05.889
and yeah, all sorts of things can go wrong

1237
01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:09.489
there as we know from every, every other aspect

1238
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.270
of our society in, in, in almost any other

1239
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280
aspect of our society. If people came along and

1240
01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:16.020
said, you know, trust me, this, this, this would

1241
01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.080
be go yeah. Right. You know.

1242
01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.199
Yeah. A and we also have to get a

1243
01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:26.520
little bit more into that uh idea of trusting

1244
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:30.439
the experts because uh I, I mean, knowing what

1245
01:05:30.449 --> 01:05:35.679
we know about how sometimes we should be careful

1246
01:05:35.689 --> 01:05:40.054
about trusting some published science. I mean, perhaps we

1247
01:05:40.064 --> 01:05:41.864
have to talk a little bit about how we

1248
01:05:41.875 --> 01:05:45.675
really should communicate that idea to the general public.

1249
01:05:45.685 --> 01:05:48.054
But uh before that, let me just ask you

1250
01:05:48.155 --> 01:05:51.094
a little bit more about the publishing system in

1251
01:05:51.104 --> 01:05:53.969
science. Do you think that uh there might be

1252
01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:58.030
some issues with it that also play a role

1253
01:05:58.129 --> 01:06:03.729
in how and why? Apparently there are so many

1254
01:06:03.739 --> 01:06:08.090
bad studies slash papers uh published.

1255
01:06:08.139 --> 01:06:12.610
Yes, I mean, it, the system is clearly nuts.

1256
01:06:12.909 --> 01:06:15.550
In the, in the late in the early 21st

1257
01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.129
century, you would never organize the system around that.

1258
01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:22.610
What we have is the result of 300 years,

1259
01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:27.939
but certainly 50 or 60 years of repeated kind

1260
01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:32.939
of um optimization of a process that suits the

1261
01:06:32.949 --> 01:06:38.919
publishers and doesn't and suits suits the individual scientists.

1262
01:06:38.929 --> 01:06:42.439
It just doesn't suit the interests of science. And

1263
01:06:42.449 --> 01:06:46.580
there is um there is a sort of growing

1264
01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:51.620
realization that the people who are successful are successful

1265
01:06:51.629 --> 01:06:53.419
cos they published a lot and therefore they're not

1266
01:06:53.429 --> 01:06:56.139
gonna call into question the publishing system. It did

1267
01:06:56.149 --> 01:06:59.179
OK, by them, uh the people who are criticizing

1268
01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:00.639
it are the people who haven't yet published a

1269
01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:01.989
lot. And of course, the people at the top

1270
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.620
would say, well, you're just jealous, you just haven't

1271
01:07:03.629 --> 01:07:06.459
published a lot once you understand the system, you

1272
01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:09.010
know, you'll see that it's good for you. And

1273
01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.320
of course, the people who are selected to be

1274
01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:13.070
at the top are the people who published a

1275
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.050
lot. So it's self reinforcing. I mean, it, it

1276
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.570
actually means you can't tell one way or the

1277
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.820
other, both sides are biased, both sides are biased

1278
01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.350
or have the potential to be biased. I personally

1279
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.219
back the people who say that the system is,

1280
01:07:26.229 --> 01:07:29.120
is wrong, but we should acknowledge that the people

1281
01:07:29.129 --> 01:07:30.600
who are saying the system is wrong are by

1282
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.669
and large, not the people who've been through the

1283
01:07:32.679 --> 01:07:36.100
system. And that, that doesn't prove that the people

1284
01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:37.889
who are saying that it's good because they've got

1285
01:07:37.899 --> 01:07:41.879
to the top um uh our, our role, but

1286
01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:44.350
we should, you know, consider that possibility that they're

1287
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.540
there because they were successful at publishing. So, um

1288
01:07:48.989 --> 01:07:50.800
you would need to have a kind of relatively

1289
01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:53.770
neutral external party to say, you know, is it

1290
01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.909
a question of survivorship bias or is there something

1291
01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:59.050
something deeply wrong with the system? I, I think

1292
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.780
it's fairly easy to make out the case that

1293
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.929
there's something fairly wrong with the system. Uh But

1294
01:08:03.939 --> 01:08:06.439
um it's, it's, it's what we all grew up

1295
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:08.909
with and there's nobody, you know, there's nobody who

1296
01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:12.179
remembers the time before it was about journals and

1297
01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:17.089
impact factors and um you know, other stuff that

1298
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:22.370
you shouldn't be doing. So the publishing system, we,

1299
01:08:22.379 --> 01:08:26.740
we've we've, the, the sort of administrative side of

1300
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:33.689
academia has piggybacked onto completely contingent features of the

1301
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:39.890
public trading system such as uh uh H index

1302
01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:44.859
and citation counts. Um WHICH somebody came up with

1303
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:48.160
one day, you know, in someone in 1963 wrote

1304
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:50.609
a paper saying, how about we count someone's H

1305
01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.450
index? And all of a sudden the H index

1306
01:08:52.459 --> 01:08:54.779
is all that counts as a measure of your

1307
01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.790
uh academic productivity. But we didn't, we didn't have

1308
01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.870
a commission, we didn't have a sort of 15

1309
01:08:59.879 --> 01:09:02.259
year scientific commission to say what's the best way

1310
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.520
to evaluate uh research because we were in a

1311
01:09:05.529 --> 01:09:07.569
hurry and we needed stuff doing now and this

1312
01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.390
was handy and we'll do that and now everyone's

1313
01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.879
and, and same with um impact factor journal, impact

1314
01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:17.669
Factor. And so journals now spend a great deal

1315
01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.109
of their time trying to manipulate their impact factor.

1316
01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:25.040
Uh So for example, what's very common and some

1317
01:09:25.049 --> 01:09:27.049
publishers do it more than others, but it's common

1318
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:30.859
is that an article will be published uh online

1319
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:34.569
first and then it won't appear in the paper

1320
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.129
if there is a paper, but it won't get

1321
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.330
proper page numbers and a volume number uh for

1322
01:09:39.339 --> 01:09:42.738
18 months. And the reason for that is that

1323
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:45.519
the impact factor is measured for the five years

1324
01:09:45.528 --> 01:09:49.118
after official publication. So they want to hit the

1325
01:09:49.127 --> 01:09:52.148
ground running. And of course, it's very difficult for

1326
01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:55.438
a paper to get cited in the first. Um

1327
01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:00.959
No, I just, if Zoom has just seen me

1328
01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:03.350
put my hand up, yeah,

1329
01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.359
I, I, that, that's C I for you, I

1330
01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:06.870
guess.

1331
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:12.229
Um BUT yeah, so um what was I saying?

1332
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.500
Yeah, so um obviously when your paper appears it's

1333
01:10:15.509 --> 01:10:17.669
not gonna be cited the next month because anything

1334
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.169
that might cite it has to be written and

1335
01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.220
has to go through the pipeline. And so a

1336
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:23.540
lot of journals now, for example, are, yeah, not

1337
01:10:23.549 --> 01:10:26.479
publishing, not putting an official publication date and page

1338
01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.660
number on an article for 18 months. So that

1339
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:32.939
the moment that the clock starts, they hit the

1340
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:35.799
ground running and they get kind of impact factor

1341
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:39.049
juice out of that publication uh from the start.

1342
01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.720
And there are various other ways in which the

1343
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:46.810
publishers uh um game, the impact factor and we

1344
01:10:46.819 --> 01:10:49.149
all know it's being game but nobody does anything

1345
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.640
about it partly because there isn't really anyone to

1346
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:55.500
do anything about it. So um science is not

1347
01:10:55.509 --> 01:10:58.779
like the Catholic church, you know, with a guy

1348
01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.810
at the top who can sort of say as

1349
01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:04.669
of tomorrow, this happens. Science is much more like

1350
01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.839
um uh Sunni Islam, you know, very, very, very

1351
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:14.290
distributed, no hierarchy, no kind of, you know, great

1352
01:11:14.299 --> 01:11:17.720
hierarchy of the, of, of the priesthood. I apologize

1353
01:11:17.729 --> 01:11:20.109
to any Sunni Muslims watching this. But the impression

1354
01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.640
I have is that Sunni in particular is extremely

1355
01:11:22.649 --> 01:11:25.560
decentralized. And so there isn't even anybody who could

1356
01:11:25.569 --> 01:11:27.919
decide to do this. And when you see people

1357
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:30.700
on Twitter saying, well, we should do this. It's

1358
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:34.649
like, well, you can't because the, you know, the

1359
01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.790
only people who could decide to do that are

1360
01:11:36.799 --> 01:11:39.169
the publishers and they will decide what's in the

1361
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:41.490
interests of their shareholders by and large. Those that

1362
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.189
are run for profit. And the funny, the, the

1363
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.390
kind of tragic thing is even publishers that aren't

1364
01:11:46.399 --> 01:11:48.109
run for profit tend to behave as if they

1365
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.069
are. So, for example, the American Psychological Association is,

1366
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.169
is really one of the worst offenders in many

1367
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:57.430
publishing practices, even though in theory, it only works

1368
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:58.649
for the benefit of its members.

1369
01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.569
But, but I mean, uh uh related to that,

1370
01:12:03.979 --> 01:12:06.500
how is it? I want to ask you this

1371
01:12:06.509 --> 01:12:09.609
question because I mean, particularly for people who are

1372
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:15.180
not associated with academia or have academia related occupations,

1373
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:19.220
perhaps, sometimes it might feel very hard to understand

1374
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:22.620
how this happens. But how is it that so

1375
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:30.339
much bad science sometimes go unchecked for so long

1376
01:12:31.479 --> 01:12:34.379
because, well, first of all, so much gets published,

1377
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:40.459
I mean, we, we publish 234 orders of magnitude

1378
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:45.180
more science than we can consume as, as scientists.

1379
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.879
Um, YOU have a, if you work in a

1380
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:51.669
department, you work in the psychology department at a

1381
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.509
large university and you're coming in the morning and

1382
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:57.200
read your calling. Oh, my paper got accepted. Oh,

1383
01:12:57.209 --> 01:13:00.910
they'll say congratulations. They won't read it, they haven't

1384
01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:05.919
got time. So there's this absolute fire hose of

1385
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:10.040
publications coming at us and almost nobody will ever

1386
01:13:10.049 --> 01:13:14.720
read any of them. Um, SO that's the, the,

1387
01:13:14.729 --> 01:13:18.279
we, we're just publishing way too much. So, nobody

1388
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:21.049
who's likely to have a, a particularly critical opinion

1389
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.509
is likely to read your paper. Now, if you're

1390
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:26.509
in a very small area then maybe they will.

1391
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.859
And if it's a, you know, small but, uh,

1392
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:32.350
important area, but then you're gonna read that through

1393
01:13:32.359 --> 01:13:34.450
the lens probably of your professional jealousies of the

1394
01:13:34.459 --> 01:13:38.520
author anyway. So that's another. But by and large,

1395
01:13:38.529 --> 01:13:40.330
it's because we publish too much, we just publish

1396
01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:43.620
way, way, way too much. And so, OK, there's

1397
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:45.729
this paper, it says that this modulates the imp

1398
01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.660
implement of this on this. Oh, ok. If I'm

1399
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:50.450
working in that I might find it. But it's

1400
01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:53.990
quite often you won't find that you won't cite

1401
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.310
that paper because you remember reading it, you'll cite

1402
01:13:56.319 --> 01:13:58.750
that paper cos you'll be looking for some support

1403
01:13:58.759 --> 01:14:00.850
for your argument in your literature review and you'll

1404
01:14:00.859 --> 01:14:03.930
Google it and you'll read the abstract. But one

1405
01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.319
of the things that happens certainly happens a lot

1406
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:09.120
with my papers is when I read papers that

1407
01:14:09.129 --> 01:14:12.040
cite what I've written in a, a third or

1408
01:14:12.049 --> 01:14:14.609
more of the cases. They actually think it says

1409
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.350
the opposite of what I said, cos they haven't

1410
01:14:17.359 --> 01:14:19.910
read or understood it. They've just kind of, you

1411
01:14:19.919 --> 01:14:21.879
know, oh, we sh we should, we should cite

1412
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.410
something to say. X and say, yeah, I think

1413
01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.279
that Nick Brown guy had a paper that did

1414
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:28.729
it and they'll go to Google Scholar and they'll

1415
01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.870
look at the titles and they'll click on something

1416
01:14:30.879 --> 01:14:32.709
and they'll read the abstract and go, yeah. Good

1417
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.790
enough Brown and whatever. 2015. And they're either citing

1418
01:14:36.799 --> 01:14:39.149
the wrong paper or they haven't read, you know,

1419
01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.890
they haven't read it or they've missed the word

1420
01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:45.060
not out or something. And, and, and so it's,

1421
01:14:45.569 --> 01:14:50.419
it's just being produced in French. We say a

1422
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.770
la loche by the bucket load, by the bucket

1423
01:14:53.779 --> 01:14:57.430
load. And when you produce stuff by the bucket

1424
01:14:57.439 --> 01:15:01.790
load, that's what happens. You know, you can't produce

1425
01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:06.439
masterpieces uh on a, on a production line. So

1426
01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:08.770
really, it starts with the fact that we're producing

1427
01:15:08.779 --> 01:15:11.959
way too much science. But what happened was 1945

1428
01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:13.680
we'd won World War Two or the Americans, you

1429
01:15:13.689 --> 01:15:16.160
know, we won World War two with science. Science

1430
01:15:16.169 --> 01:15:20.200
is good. Therefore more science is better. And um,

1431
01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.049
you know, even today, it's quite hard for even

1432
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.270
the most kind of pro maga people to suggest

1433
01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:31.720
cutting the science budget. Uh But if you know,

1434
01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:34.660
if, if, if uh next year you get President

1435
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:36.470
Trump and he decides to cut the science budget

1436
01:15:36.479 --> 01:15:38.819
by 90% I'm gonna be hard pushed, I'm gonna

1437
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.100
be hard pushed to tell you why he shouldn't

1438
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:46.370
because I think we have 1020 times too many

1439
01:15:46.379 --> 01:15:51.229
people doing science to be able to do anything

1440
01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.000
useful. We've got enormous numbers of people doing kind

1441
01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:57.620
of science. Busy work. I don't know if you

1442
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:59.339
know the term busy work. It's, it's, it's w

1443
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.339
when you're a kindergarten teacher it's what you do

1444
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:03.310
to keep the kids quiet and do some cutting

1445
01:16:03.319 --> 01:16:05.770
out, do some painting, you know, fill up some

1446
01:16:05.779 --> 01:16:08.540
time. Um, AND we, we've got people doing enormous

1447
01:16:08.549 --> 01:16:10.979
amounts of science, busy work. They're not going to

1448
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:13.290
discover anything. They're not using methods that are going

1449
01:16:13.299 --> 01:16:16.299
to discover anything. We're sort of claiming that we're

1450
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.939
training them to be scientists, but they're not, you

1451
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.410
know, they're not making any worthwhile discoveries and they're

1452
01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:26.009
not going to make any worthwhile discoveries. And it's,

1453
01:16:26.299 --> 01:16:28.029
again, it's not a nice thing to say to

1454
01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.189
people. I, I do sometimes have this discussion with

1455
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.270
my fellow scientists and to my, they don't push

1456
01:16:33.279 --> 01:16:35.109
back as much as I, as much as I

1457
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.029
uh expect when I say, I think we need

1458
01:16:37.089 --> 01:16:40.379
to get rid of 90% of scientists. Um Most

1459
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:41.589
of them seem to think they'll be in the

1460
01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.209
remaining 10%. Uh MAYBE I have very talented uh

1461
01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.939
friends. But uh it, it, we are just doing

1462
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:51.959
way, way, way too much. We're doing way too

1463
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:54.240
much science and as a result, there's lots of

1464
01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:55.790
garbage. Now, if we got rid of the problem

1465
01:16:55.799 --> 01:16:57.229
is if we got rid of 90% we probably

1466
01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.209
wouldn't get rid of the right 90% because, you

1467
01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:03.629
know, when you, when you, when you do that

1468
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.790
kind of exercise people survive on the basis of

1469
01:17:06.799 --> 01:17:11.410
favoritism and friendships. And, um, but yeah, I think

1470
01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:13.600
we do have to give some thought to doing

1471
01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:16.729
less science heretical though. That is

1472
01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:21.919
a a and, but realistically speaking, what would you

1473
01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:25.810
say could be some solutions here, particularly when it

1474
01:17:25.819 --> 01:17:30.410
comes to publishing, to really try to avoid as

1475
01:17:30.419 --> 01:17:36.600
much as possible. Uh Bad science getting published. Well,

1476
01:17:36.609 --> 01:17:41.089
to start with. Absolutely, every paper should present the

1477
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:45.410
full raw data and the every computational step that

1478
01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:49.609
was done to get to the results and people

1479
01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.779
sort of go oh, but what about human subjects

1480
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:55.819
protection and in 99% of cases in psychology, that's

1481
01:17:55.830 --> 01:18:01.919
just an excuse. Um You know, absolute you, yes,

1482
01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:06.080
if you're doing research among politic, you know, political

1483
01:18:06.089 --> 01:18:09.220
dissidents in some country and their lives are in

1484
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:13.109
danger or if you're dealing with highly vulnerable people,

1485
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.899
then maybe, then maybe, then we can talk about

1486
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.419
it, then we can have specialized journals. But the

1487
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:22.939
default ought to be, you show your raw data

1488
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:26.819
as a minimum to the reviewers. There may be

1489
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:30.580
data that you can't publish. But the idea that

1490
01:18:30.589 --> 01:18:33.149
you have data that is so sensitive that only

1491
01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.729
you are allowed to see it and not your

1492
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.569
peers who are reviewing it is like, well, what

1493
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.649
qualifications did you go through to make you able

1494
01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:46.830
to see those sensitive data. Why are you allowed

1495
01:18:46.839 --> 01:18:50.410
to know the names of these political dissidents are

1496
01:18:50.419 --> 01:18:54.529
not your peers who promised to keep it quiet?

1497
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:57.669
The medical profession manages this. When I go for

1498
01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.770
an X ray, you know, and the, my doctor

1499
01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.979
wants a second opinion. He sends it through. He

1500
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.890
doesn't go. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not gonna send

1501
01:19:04.899 --> 01:19:07.729
it through because that other doctor might put your,

1502
01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.160
you know, might put your genitals on the internet

1503
01:19:11.169 --> 01:19:14.919
or something. You know, there are punishments for that.

1504
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.620
So we, I if I join, if I might

1505
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.379
be your peer reviewer and you won't let you

1506
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:23.189
see the data, but you're hiring and if I

1507
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.290
join your lab tomorrow, hey, I could, I could

1508
01:19:25.299 --> 01:19:28.310
just open the file. So, you know, it's not

1509
01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:31.700
like this is nuclear secrets. This is simply a

1510
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:35.169
question of covering your arse a bit. Yes. Some

1511
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.720
stuff is sensitive but you can get away with,

1512
01:19:38.729 --> 01:19:40.660
oh, it's sensitive and everyone has to go. Oh,

1513
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:42.669
it's sensitive. OK. Right. And nobody goes, no, it

1514
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.459
isn't. No, that's just bullshit because we don't like

1515
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:49.319
going to people who are telling bullshit stories and

1516
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:51.390
say sorry. That's bullshit in the same way when

1517
01:19:51.399 --> 01:19:53.689
people say, oh yeah, I sorry, I don't have

1518
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:57.220
the data. I accidentally wiped the hard drive with

1519
01:19:57.229 --> 01:20:00.799
the only copy of the data on it. Well,

1520
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.209
that isn't true. Nobody accidentally wipes a hard drive

1521
01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.609
and nobody who is capable of wiping a hard

1522
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.509
drive is not also fully aware that they need

1523
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.709
to make backups. So, what do you do when

1524
01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:18.470
somebody makes a claim that is completely unreasonable and

1525
01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:20.890
everyone's laughing at them behind their back, but nobody

1526
01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:24.790
actually stands up and go, mate. Seriously. No, no,

1527
01:20:24.799 --> 01:20:26.589
that's bullshit. We go. All right. Yes, we have

1528
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.350
to respect professors on this. No. Sorry. The guy

1529
01:20:29.359 --> 01:20:33.459
is being massively disingenuous. He probably has something to

1530
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:37.229
hide. Let's, uh, look further. But we don't do

1531
01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.020
that because it's, it's still at that level. A

1532
01:20:39.029 --> 01:20:44.160
gentleman's club. Um, SCIENCE is very much a gentleman's

1533
01:20:44.169 --> 01:20:48.160
club because academia works that way. Um, YOU know,

1534
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:50.089
how do you get a university to investigate a

1535
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.629
senior professor when they, you know, they're godfather to

1536
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:59.169
each other's kids or something? Um, YOU know, it's,

1537
01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.680
it's very difficult. There's a reason why, for example,

1538
01:21:03.339 --> 01:21:07.770
um, law enforcement people tend not to have many

1539
01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:12.600
friends outside law enforcement and vice versa because if

1540
01:21:12.609 --> 01:21:15.459
you have a good friend who is a, you

1541
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:19.819
know, senior detective, he knows that there's a chance

1542
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:22.819
one day he may have to bust you. Yeah.

1543
01:21:23.890 --> 01:21:27.419
Um, YOU know, the police know how many people

1544
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:30.270
there are out there committing offenses of various kinds

1545
01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:35.200
and it's an enormous number. Uh, I, I saw

1546
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:36.470
a thing, I wish I had a source for

1547
01:21:36.479 --> 01:21:40.430
this about 25 years ago and it was one,

1548
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.229
it was 10 million people in the UK. So

1549
01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.750
population 60,000,010 million people have a conviction for a

1550
01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:56.529
conviction for something that isn't a motoring offense. And

1551
01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.390
if you assume most of those are men, that's

1552
01:21:58.399 --> 01:22:02.000
about one men in three. So that one man

1553
01:22:02.009 --> 01:22:08.080
in three has been convicted in a court of

1554
01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:11.310
law now, probably something minor, probably just drunk and

1555
01:22:11.319 --> 01:22:13.529
disorderly or, you know, urinating in a public place

1556
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:17.419
or whatever it is. Nonetheless, one man in three

1557
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:20.979
in the UK. And I don't see any obvious

1558
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:23.450
reason why it should be vastly less elsewhere has

1559
01:22:23.459 --> 01:22:26.660
some kind of. And so, you know, when you're

1560
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:29.430
in law enforcement, you know that there's, there's a,

1561
01:22:29.439 --> 01:22:31.569
there's a chance, what am I going to do

1562
01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:36.680
one day if I have suspicions that Ricardo is

1563
01:22:36.689 --> 01:22:43.750
committing fraud. Uh And so law enforcement tends to

1564
01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:46.430
be done separately from the rest of society and

1565
01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:49.009
these people tend to exist. It's one reason why

1566
01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.970
people don't always trust police officers cos we don't

1567
01:22:50.979 --> 01:22:52.370
really know them, we don't get to know them.

1568
01:22:52.649 --> 01:22:55.120
So come back to academia all of a sudden,

1569
01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:57.649
Professor X is accused of something and there's a

1570
01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.890
committee consisting of professors A B and C to

1571
01:23:00.899 --> 01:23:08.939
investigate them. It's, it's very awkward for everybody, very

1572
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:11.979
awkward for everybody. So the there is no real

1573
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:14.779
method by which that can be investigated because there's

1574
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:20.250
no police, there's no prosecutors and the, the bad

1575
01:23:20.259 --> 01:23:24.740
people know that they, when if somebody says Blimey,

1576
01:23:24.759 --> 01:23:28.200
how did you get that amazing result? You know,

1577
01:23:29.319 --> 01:23:31.319
you're not gonna go, I made the data up.

1578
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:34.589
You're gonna come up with some moderately bullshit excuse.

1579
01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:38.029
But your colleague who you've had coffee with every

1580
01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.700
morning for the last five years is not gonna

1581
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:44.259
go, Nick. That's just bullshit. What's wrong with you?

1582
01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.540
Because we don't do that with our colleagues. We

1583
01:23:48.549 --> 01:23:52.410
just don't, I'm sure you've come across situations in

1584
01:23:52.419 --> 01:23:55.839
journalism where people have just made up stories. Mhm.

1585
01:23:56.569 --> 01:23:58.470
You know, how do you deal with that when

1586
01:23:58.479 --> 01:24:01.259
you suspect that this interview? Oh, wow, great interview

1587
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:05.180
with the, with the defense minister. Wasn't, wasn't he,

1588
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:10.689
wasn't he in Australia at the time? Um Should

1589
01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:14.689
I ask about that? I'll, I'll, I'll just keep

1590
01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:19.120
quiet, I'll wait for more evidence. Um And, and

1591
01:24:19.129 --> 01:24:22.600
we as, as a society and a society of

1592
01:24:22.609 --> 01:24:28.910
polite middle class, educated individuals are not very good

1593
01:24:28.919 --> 01:24:32.310
at calling out situations where we go, hold on

1594
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:35.879
is, is, is this just all lies cos it's

1595
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:38.819
not something we, it's not something we're used to

1596
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:42.529
dealing with. And, and so as a result, the

1597
01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.470
bad faith people can get away with a lot

1598
01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:46.509
because they just exploit the fact that nobody's ever

1599
01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.770
gonna ask them. And in many cases, these are

1600
01:24:50.779 --> 01:24:53.439
people who have been doing this since they were

1601
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:56.950
Children and they quickly learned as a child that

1602
01:24:56.959 --> 01:25:01.100
if you develop the right kind of um obfuscated

1603
01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:07.500
uh sta um strategies to deflect attention uh that,

1604
01:25:07.509 --> 01:25:09.750
that will work. And I'm sure you know, you

1605
01:25:09.759 --> 01:25:11.810
knew people like this and, you know, people like

1606
01:25:11.819 --> 01:25:14.640
this in your life who've gone through their lives,

1607
01:25:15.839 --> 01:25:19.000
they're not quite what they seem but they're pretty

1608
01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:22.810
good at hiding it and you get them in

1609
01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:25.049
every walk of life and you get science.

1610
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.160
But, uh, I, I mean, let me ask you

1611
01:25:29.169 --> 01:25:32.660
then a different kind of question. So do you

1612
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:38.240
think that as individual readers of the scientific literature,

1613
01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:42.419
I mean, as people that are interested in science,

1614
01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:47.430
that we can really do much to avoid, at

1615
01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:54.584
least sometimes giving rhythm to some bad science. I

1616
01:25:54.595 --> 01:25:58.834
mean, because we went through some examples here today

1617
01:25:58.845 --> 01:26:02.834
and at least in one of them, you mentioned

1618
01:26:02.904 --> 01:26:07.834
how hard it was to go through the data

1619
01:26:07.845 --> 01:26:10.365
and the statistical analysis and all of that. I

1620
01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:16.004
mean, it shouldn't we expect that uh most people

1621
01:26:16.015 --> 01:26:19.154
or even all of us at least now and

1622
01:26:19.165 --> 01:26:24.950
then uh will give grievance to some bad science

1623
01:26:24.959 --> 01:26:25.229
and

1624
01:26:25.689 --> 01:26:29.430
intentionally. Yeah. No, you, you can't, you can't uh

1625
01:26:29.439 --> 01:26:35.430
to a first approximation, you can't. Um And if

1626
01:26:35.439 --> 01:26:38.930
that results in staring into the abyss, then welcome

1627
01:26:38.939 --> 01:26:41.770
to the abyss. Uh YOU can't, you have to

1628
01:26:41.779 --> 01:26:45.060
trust something at some point. Uh OTHERWISE you end

1629
01:26:45.069 --> 01:26:50.669
up being a total conspiracy crank. Um And so

1630
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:55.020
um yeah, it, it, it gets, it, it gets

1631
01:26:55.029 --> 01:26:57.390
pretty dark, it gets pretty dark in places because

1632
01:26:57.399 --> 01:26:59.379
it's like, well, why should I trust this vaccine?

1633
01:26:59.879 --> 01:27:01.870
You know, why should I believe that climate change

1634
01:27:01.879 --> 01:27:04.819
is real and you know, I, I trust vaccines

1635
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:07.129
and I believe climate change is real, but um

1636
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:11.470
science is not doing itself any favors by tolerating

1637
01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:13.500
this kind of behavior. So, I mean, one of

1638
01:27:13.509 --> 01:27:15.750
the things I was involved in, in, from about

1639
01:27:15.759 --> 01:27:20.430
two years ago, uh was somebody who was faking

1640
01:27:20.439 --> 01:27:25.620
climate related research. Um She was making out that

1641
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:31.140
the effect of dissolved carbon dioxide increase in dissolved

1642
01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:34.189
carbon dioxide, increased ocean acidification, which is a well

1643
01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.140
known phenomenon. Uh And she was making out that

1644
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:40.100
the effect it was having on fish was absolutely

1645
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:44.169
catastrophic and she was making all of her data

1646
01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:48.109
up now, that doesn't mean that the effect might

1647
01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.330
not be catastrophic, but it hands ammunition on a

1648
01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:55.020
plate to people who say, who go, who say

1649
01:27:55.029 --> 01:27:57.310
climate change is a scam. It's all being done

1650
01:27:57.319 --> 01:28:01.299
by researchers for grant money because in this case,

1651
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:06.250
it was now, uh that's kind of embarrassing. I

1652
01:28:06.259 --> 01:28:08.470
don't think she was typical and, and, and she

1653
01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:10.700
wasn't doing research into the actual kind of climate

1654
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:12.100
science. It was the, you know, the knock on

1655
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:16.750
effect, but it's true that in, um, it's certainly

1656
01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:19.799
true that in, in most fields of, of animal

1657
01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:23.240
biology, for example, uh it's a lot easier to

1658
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:25.609
get your research funded if you can chick tick

1659
01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:31.129
the climate change box. Yeah. So, uh you know,

1660
01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.609
we're, we're not doing ourselves any favors uh by

1661
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:37.049
insisting on you know, everything has to be tied

1662
01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.189
to that. But I, I, yeah, this and then

1663
01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.089
this person came from a lab which produces a

1664
01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.470
whole load of dubious research. And I think, I

1665
01:28:45.479 --> 01:28:46.930
don't know whether people go in there as honest

1666
01:28:46.939 --> 01:28:49.740
citizens and come out believing that they're making discoveries

1667
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:53.930
by fabricating the data. Maybe they get on such

1668
01:28:53.939 --> 01:28:57.250
a kind of mission on what is an extremely

1669
01:28:57.259 --> 01:28:59.979
important topic that they think it's OK to fake

1670
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:03.060
results. Certainly the people who blew the whistle uh

1671
01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:08.939
on this individual are, you know, mainstream, mainstream biologists

1672
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:11.930
concerned about the impact of climate change. But they

1673
01:29:11.939 --> 01:29:15.339
also say it's not doing anyone any favors to

1674
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:20.299
exaggerate the the impact um or to to fake

1675
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:24.020
data about it. So in terms of trust in

1676
01:29:24.029 --> 01:29:27.770
science, yeah, for exa another example is III I

1677
01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:31.120
worked with some people on various fake COVID cures

1678
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:33.359
and those are relatively easy to debunk because most

1679
01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:35.850
of the studies claiming, you know, most of the

1680
01:29:36.339 --> 01:29:39.240
trials claimed to have been done never took place

1681
01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:41.770
and the data were fake. But the same per

1682
01:29:41.779 --> 01:29:43.529
one of the people who was I was helping

1683
01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.270
with that has discovered that pfizer still hasn't released

1684
01:29:47.399 --> 01:29:50.580
one of their uh chunks of trial data that

1685
01:29:50.589 --> 01:29:53.500
they should have done. You know, I had my

1686
01:29:53.509 --> 01:29:57.549
Pfizer jab yesterday, I have reasonable faith. You know,

1687
01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.120
I had COVID, I didn't get as ill as

1688
01:29:59.129 --> 01:30:00.950
I probably could have done if I hadn't had

1689
01:30:00.959 --> 01:30:03.200
the jab, but they still haven't released those data.

1690
01:30:03.209 --> 01:30:08.879
Come on, come on, you know, um you know,

1691
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:14.609
uh so there, you know, there is bad behavior

1692
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:18.330
at all the levels, I suppose after a while,

1693
01:30:18.339 --> 01:30:21.250
it just becomes a question of the overwhelming consensus.

1694
01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:26.009
Um AND particularly in reproducible sciences, then you kind

1695
01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.310
of look at the consensus. So if someone produces

1696
01:30:28.319 --> 01:30:32.189
a bad uh a bad paper on, on superconductors,

1697
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.029
for example, there's always something about superconductors. Um YOU'LL

1698
01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.029
know within three months, if it's real cos somebody

1699
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.270
will go and try and make the same, you

1700
01:30:40.279 --> 01:30:43.229
know, compound and it'll either work or it won't

1701
01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.910
and that will get dropped very quickly in psychology

1702
01:30:45.919 --> 01:30:49.180
because the concepts are all so kind of malleable.

1703
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:52.029
Uh You can always plead that they weren't really

1704
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.779
testing what you thought, what they thought they were

1705
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:58.919
testing and you can eventually the line of research

1706
01:30:58.930 --> 01:31:01.830
will collapse. But by then you'll have retired, you'll

1707
01:31:01.839 --> 01:31:03.669
have got the best selling book, 15 years will

1708
01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.919
have gone by and nobody will care. So it's,

1709
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:09.939
it's much easier to um to get away with

1710
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:12.549
that kind of thing in, in a, in psychology.

1711
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.950
And then in, in, in basic biology research, the

1712
01:31:16.959 --> 01:31:19.029
problem is that there's so many diseases and so

1713
01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.339
many genes that anyone, a lot of these fake

1714
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.669
papers that are written to order you just pick

1715
01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.000
a gene, pick a disease and someone will write

1716
01:31:26.009 --> 01:31:29.390
a story saying the two are linked with experiments

1717
01:31:29.399 --> 01:31:32.450
that never took place, but it's very formulaic and

1718
01:31:32.459 --> 01:31:34.279
no one will ever test that because the chances

1719
01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:36.140
are that nobody's looking at that gene for that

1720
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:39.859
disease every so often somebody might come along and

1721
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:41.479
say, oh, I was interested, oh, and, and I

1722
01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:44.629
got misled by this fake paper. But the, these

1723
01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.500
fake papers mostly are just bulking out the journals

1724
01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:50.160
and bulking up the university's kind of count of

1725
01:31:50.169 --> 01:31:52.870
how much prestigious research we're doing. But there isn't

1726
01:31:52.879 --> 01:31:55.129
even a great danger of them causing too much

1727
01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.910
individually causing too much problem because nobody's even gonna

1728
01:31:57.919 --> 01:32:00.939
read them. Yeah. And, and, and you get this

1729
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:04.859
rather kind of ca care situation of, of, um,

1730
01:32:05.129 --> 01:32:08.720
I call them, write only papers, you know, they,

1731
01:32:08.729 --> 01:32:11.319
they, they're only ever written and published and nobody

1732
01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:15.200
ever reads them but somebody somewhere has an economic

1733
01:32:15.209 --> 01:32:18.410
interest in doing that. I don't know if you

1734
01:32:18.419 --> 01:32:21.250
ever Google, sometimes you Google for a phrase and

1735
01:32:21.259 --> 01:32:24.459
there's this page on the internet of complete gibberish

1736
01:32:24.879 --> 01:32:27.819
that's been copied and pasted from 25 different and

1737
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:31.169
maybe translated into Albanian and back to English. And

1738
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.919
you go, what even is this page doing? And

1739
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:37.089
there aren't any adverts on there but there's somebody

1740
01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.759
somewhere has identified that there's a very small economic

1741
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:42.299
benefit to doing that. And, and uh yeah, it,

1742
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:43.810
it, it, it's like that a lot of, a

1743
01:32:43.819 --> 01:32:49.870
lot of what's called scientific publication is just very,

1744
01:32:49.879 --> 01:32:54.169
very marginal economic benefits. From somebody and that appears

1745
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.919
to have no impact on anyone else. You know,

1746
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:59.979
who is the victim, who is the victim. If

1747
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:02.740
I publish a scientific paper about research that never

1748
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:07.750
took place on a gene disease link that no

1749
01:33:07.759 --> 01:33:12.250
one else is interested in investigating who's the, who's

1750
01:33:12.259 --> 01:33:18.399
the victim? Yeah, it's, it's difficult. It, how would

1751
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:23.209
you ever prosecute that on what basis would you

1752
01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:26.649
try to discipline somebody? And if you only discover

1753
01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.490
it three years later and they've moved on to

1754
01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.279
another university, the university where they were at the

1755
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:35.020
time says, well, they left the university where they

1756
01:33:35.029 --> 01:33:36.569
are now, will say, hey, it wasn't done at

1757
01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:39.779
our university and, and um a lot of fraudulent

1758
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:42.040
people, if you, if you move every three years,

1759
01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:45.859
you'll, you, you'll essentially never get formally sanctioned for

1760
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:50.509
any form of malpractice because your current university will

1761
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.770
never investigate you for stuff at another place. And

1762
01:33:53.779 --> 01:33:57.649
your previous place says, hey, they moved on. That's,

1763
01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.330
uh you know, if you imagine, imagine if you

1764
01:33:59.339 --> 01:34:02.220
could commit actual kind of financial fraud by moving

1765
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:04.259
on to a different bank every three years.

1766
01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:09.680
Well, but uh I mean, related to that when

1767
01:34:09.689 --> 01:34:13.919
it comes to the idea that we communicate to

1768
01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:16.379
people, and I, I still think it's a good

1769
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:19.319
idea of course, when we tell people that they

1770
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.359
should trust the experts. Uh AND, and I mean,

1771
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:25.680
we really do need to trust the experts because

1772
01:34:25.689 --> 01:34:32.220
realistically speaking, we cannot evaluate data from all sorts

1773
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:36.540
of places by ourselves. I mean, that's impossible. But

1774
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:42.560
uh but, but since there's still some bad science,

1775
01:34:42.569 --> 01:34:46.250
some fraudulent science, I mean, sometimes I'm afraid that

1776
01:34:46.509 --> 01:34:52.089
if we just say without adding anything to it

1777
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:57.549
without adding any warnings or nuance with uh trustee

1778
01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.169
experts, then if sometimes it happens that people know

1779
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:05.649
that all this piece of science, this piece of

1780
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.524
research got published and then five years later, it

1781
01:35:09.535 --> 01:35:13.285
was discovered that it was just pure fraud or

1782
01:35:13.294 --> 01:35:17.984
something like that, that people might get cynical and

1783
01:35:17.995 --> 01:35:20.975
think, oh, ok, if it works like that, then

1784
01:35:21.285 --> 01:35:23.944
uh I will just go like this. If it

1785
01:35:23.955 --> 01:35:28.944
confirms my pre-existing beliefs, then I will trust the

1786
01:35:28.955 --> 01:35:33.439
experts if it doesn't to hell with it. So,

1787
01:35:33.529 --> 01:35:36.729
you know, so how should we handle it?

1788
01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.089
Well, I I there's not much you can do

1789
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.629
about what people, what people out there want to

1790
01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.479
believe. Uh I think the, the issue is when

1791
01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:48.209
it starts affecting public policy. Um AND, and we,

1792
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.770
you know, you, when you, when you see the

1793
01:35:49.779 --> 01:35:53.000
kind of Q and on crazies, uh finding themselves

1794
01:35:53.009 --> 01:35:56.020
actually getting elected to congress, et cetera. Um And

1795
01:35:56.029 --> 01:35:58.000
you know, there are one or two an rabidly

1796
01:35:58.009 --> 01:36:01.740
anti vax members of parliament in the UK. Um

1797
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:06.799
But um by and large, I think you have

1798
01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:08.259
to sort of hope for the wisdom of the,

1799
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:11.750
of the majority. I think also the majority of

1800
01:36:11.759 --> 01:36:14.919
scientific fraud. Is in areas that people don't really

1801
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:19.109
care about. Uh It's not taking place in, in

1802
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:22.620
uh the most basic stuff that can be replicated

1803
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:25.339
easily and which turns into technology, whether that's medical

1804
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:32.509
technology, uh or, um, or, or computer technology that

1805
01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.910
said, I think there is a, we are approaching

1806
01:36:37.919 --> 01:36:41.080
a point where, for example, a lot of drug

1807
01:36:41.089 --> 01:36:48.500
development is now on drugs that have moderate effects

1808
01:36:48.509 --> 01:36:55.200
at best and whether or not those effects are

1809
01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:57.729
real and how will we discover if they're not?

1810
01:36:58.149 --> 01:37:02.370
Um, SO, you know, nobody's going to doubt the

1811
01:37:02.379 --> 01:37:05.689
effect of penicillin, for example, but if you have

1812
01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.259
a new disea, uh if you have a new

1813
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:09.439
drug for, I mean, talk about Alzheimer's, which is

1814
01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:10.850
in the news at the moment with two or

1815
01:37:10.859 --> 01:37:14.640
three stories of, of various forms of either historical

1816
01:37:14.649 --> 01:37:20.529
or current fraudulent research. How do you know that

1817
01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:25.399
an Alzheimer's drug is working? And how do you

1818
01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:30.689
know that it's working when it claims when the

1819
01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.569
only claim their claim is not, you know, Alzheimer's

1820
01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:37.020
will go away, you know, your, your, your grandmother

1821
01:37:37.029 --> 01:37:40.080
is going to be, you know, playing chess at

1822
01:37:40.089 --> 01:37:45.609
national level in three years time. Um When the

1823
01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.689
claim is that it makes significant difference to the

1824
01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.149
severity of symptoms. Uh, HOW are you going to

1825
01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.189
test that? Because these things are all based on

1826
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.620
samples and averages and there's always gonna be people

1827
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:03.509
for whom it doesn't work. We've got used to

1828
01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.160
having medicines that have relatively dramatic effects. You know,

1829
01:38:08.169 --> 01:38:10.169
we bring in a measles vaccine and all of

1830
01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.770
a sudden the number of measles cases goes from

1831
01:38:11.779 --> 01:38:14.500
that down to here. I mean, you can, um,

1832
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:19.930
it's, it's quite easy to hide poor science if

1833
01:38:19.939 --> 01:38:24.339
your claim is fairly modest. Now, normally, when claims

1834
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:27.640
are fairly modest, they don't then become that important.

1835
01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.779
So obvious you get things in psychology and, you

1836
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:33.990
know, we're going to reduce your back depression inventory

1837
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.399
score from 4.2 and 3.8. But people aren't rushing

1838
01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:39.479
out to change public policy on that basis. You

1839
01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:40.819
know, maybe one or two people are going to

1840
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:43.580
an expensive training course they didn't need. But if

1841
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:45.359
you come along and say we, you know, we're

1842
01:38:45.370 --> 01:38:50.879
going to reduce Alzheimer's symptoms, we're going to delay

1843
01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:57.419
the onset of dependency by 18 months on average.

1844
01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.680
And people are reading about this, this new drug

1845
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:04.629
and you're going well, my mum, my dad is

1846
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.589
an early stage Alzheimer's if we could have 18

1847
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.899
months more with them before, you know, these things

1848
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:17.339
are fairly inevitable. But before the decline, how much

1849
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:19.250
would you pay for that? Or how much would

1850
01:39:19.259 --> 01:39:21.850
you in a European context? You know, demand that

1851
01:39:21.859 --> 01:39:25.810
your health system pays for that rather than shingles

1852
01:39:25.819 --> 01:39:27.680
vaccine. I have to go for a shingles vaccine

1853
01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:34.049
tomorrow and it's expensive. Um And how would we

1854
01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.609
know if it was or wasn't having an effect?

1855
01:39:37.419 --> 01:39:39.509
And it's really quite difficult because, you know, we

1856
01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.899
do that on the basis of observation report of

1857
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.149
the statistics and those kind of, that kind of

1858
01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.020
research is quite, is quite easy to falsify. So

1859
01:39:49.029 --> 01:39:52.129
I think that is historically, it's not been too

1860
01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.220
much of a problem because the kind of gee

1861
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:56.259
whiz claims that have turned out to be false,

1862
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:59.720
the kind of Cyril Burt, uh, things, the, I

1863
01:39:59.899 --> 01:40:03.879
think psychology stuff, um, has tended to be fairly

1864
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:06.850
fluffy stuff. But with one or two exceptions, uh

1865
01:40:06.859 --> 01:40:09.979
with things like the nudging and the, you know,

1866
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:12.020
signing the paper at the top to say you'll

1867
01:40:12.029 --> 01:40:14.250
be honest, one or two, but it hasn't really

1868
01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:17.290
had a huge impact. But the, the medical stuff

1869
01:40:17.299 --> 01:40:19.629
I'm starting to worry about now because the claims

1870
01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:22.180
are no longer, you take one of these pills,

1871
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:24.770
it costs $3 and, and, you know, it will

1872
01:40:24.779 --> 01:40:27.140
go away. We will know we, we, the, I,

1873
01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:30.560
they're talking now about malaria vaccines that are 50

1874
01:40:30.569 --> 01:40:34.000
or 60% efficient and can be made for, I

1875
01:40:34.009 --> 01:40:38.299
don't know, 20 $30. If we deploy several, tens

1876
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:41.240
of millions of those, we will see, we will

1877
01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:43.720
see in the figures that there is that much

1878
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:46.129
less malaria and we will know that they work

1879
01:40:47.009 --> 01:40:52.189
um, some of these other drugs that, you know,

1880
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.770
with modest claim effects, how are we gonna know

1881
01:40:54.779 --> 01:40:57.770
if they're working or not? It, it's very difficult

1882
01:40:57.779 --> 01:41:00.339
because the, you know, the whole initial claim is

1883
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:04.009
difficult to evaluate uh uh uh a percentage drop

1884
01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:07.049
of this, you know, with what statistical techniques. And

1885
01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.109
even if the research is being done, honestly, people

1886
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.240
don't always agree about the right way to analyze

1887
01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:15.430
these things. So yeah, historically, it was I think

1888
01:41:15.439 --> 01:41:17.799
simpler because you make, you know, you claim you

1889
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:21.479
made a superconductor, nobody needs to worry about that

1890
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:23.140
because in three months time, we'll either know if

1891
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:25.859
it works or if it doesn't. Uh But if

1892
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:27.600
you play some of the, some of the stuff

1893
01:41:27.609 --> 01:41:29.720
in, in the medical area is, is and we

1894
01:41:29.729 --> 01:41:32.160
know we know that plenty of drugs are marketed

1895
01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:36.930
that don't work. Mhm. Uh And, and sometimes are

1896
01:41:36.939 --> 01:41:40.970
worse than useless. Um And then was that because

1897
01:41:40.979 --> 01:41:44.540
of statistical errors in the phase three trials or

1898
01:41:44.549 --> 01:41:50.439
was there faking going on? Um Yeah, difficult or,

1899
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.850
or

1900
01:41:50.859 --> 01:41:57.419
sometimes you even get unregulated stuff like supplements, for

1901
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.930
example.

1902
01:41:58.629 --> 01:42:00.500
Uh Yes, but at least no one's, I mean,

1903
01:42:00.509 --> 01:42:03.450
no one's hopefully taking some of the those claims

1904
01:42:03.459 --> 01:42:05.490
seriously. But I was talking this morning, this is

1905
01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:08.009
someone on Twitter about there's this drug that makes

1906
01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.350
you apparently lose weight quite effectively. I forgot its

1907
01:42:11.359 --> 01:42:13.910
name. I think we V is one of the

1908
01:42:13.919 --> 01:42:17.100
brand names. And so what's happening now is people

1909
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:19.520
are buying a fake version of it over the

1910
01:42:19.529 --> 01:42:22.589
internet because everyone read about it. Let's assume the

1911
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.350
research is genuine and that the, the drug is

1912
01:42:25.359 --> 01:42:29.060
great. The pro the problem is the drug's quite

1913
01:42:29.069 --> 01:42:30.899
hard to get, you have to get it prescribed

1914
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:33.270
and your doctor won't necessarily prescribe it for, you

1915
01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:36.310
know, something minor. Uh, AND so people are going

1916
01:42:36.319 --> 01:42:37.830
out to the internet and buying it or at

1917
01:42:37.839 --> 01:42:39.379
least they think they're buying it. They're probably just

1918
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:42.270
getting, you know, flour and water or something. Uh,

1919
01:42:42.279 --> 01:42:46.089
BUT to some extent that's a problem. It, you've

1920
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:49.339
got a, you've got a societal problem caused by

1921
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:53.319
the research on this drug that arguably kind of

1922
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:55.609
isn't the fault of the people who made the

1923
01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.220
drug. But the, the press got hold of it.

1924
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:02.330
You've got to get this, you know, and, and

1925
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:04.140
they get whatever the 10 letter name of the

1926
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:06.009
drug is, you've gotta get this and people go

1927
01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.779
and type it into Google and off, they go.

1928
01:43:08.169 --> 01:43:12.250
Um, THAT'S another problem for society of, of, um,

1929
01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:15.680
sort of criminal derivation of, of, of, of, of,

1930
01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.370
of scientific research that we also have to look

1931
01:43:18.379 --> 01:43:20.180
at. So I think there's an even wider problem

1932
01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.299
of, of how do you communicate truth to people,

1933
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:28.290
um, whether it's scientific truth or, you know, political

1934
01:43:28.299 --> 01:43:32.209
truth or, you know, and, and then, you know,

1935
01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:35.290
so we, we t, I don't know it, this

1936
01:43:35.299 --> 01:43:36.490
is the kind of thing that we ought to

1937
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.589
be able to ask psychologists about. It's just that

1938
01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.600
psychologists aren't very good at it as we've seen.

1939
01:43:44.979 --> 01:43:47.680
Um, IF you look at, you know, during COVID,

1940
01:43:48.439 --> 01:43:51.080
um, some of the advice from the psychologist. Well,

1941
01:43:51.089 --> 01:43:53.540
it was based on this kind of crappy nudging

1942
01:43:53.549 --> 01:43:55.979
theory. Most of which I think is probably, is

1943
01:43:55.990 --> 01:44:00.339
probably at least at the very least bad, bad

1944
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:02.080
signs and quite a lot of it I suspect

1945
01:44:02.089 --> 01:44:05.450
is faked. Um, BUT, oh, yes, the nudging. Yes.

1946
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:08.500
Um, THERE was a book you could buy at

1947
01:44:08.509 --> 01:44:09.890
the airport called Nudge.

1948
01:44:11.419 --> 01:44:12.680
You remember that one?

1949
01:44:13.649 --> 01:44:16.169
Well, for example, that book, the first edition was

1950
01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:20.609
full of uh cute stuff by Brian Wansink, the

1951
01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.729
food research guy who then got fired by Cornell

1952
01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.779
after we showed that he'd been uh well, amongst

1953
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:30.399
other things, making up his data. And uh and

1954
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:32.169
then the second edition of that book came out,

1955
01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:34.080
but they just dropped all those references. They didn't

1956
01:44:34.089 --> 01:44:38.020
put a Ford say, oops, the first edition of

1957
01:44:38.029 --> 01:44:40.189
this book was full of bullshit about that. Well,

1958
01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.819
that all turned out to be crap. But this

1959
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:44.200
stuff, you know, trust us all the rest's really

1960
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:46.470
solid. They didn't say anything at all. They just

1961
01:44:46.479 --> 01:44:48.649
produced a new edition and he was airbrushed out.

1962
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:56.859
Um You know, and they, you know, these gu

1963
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:59.950
the um these guys make quite a lot of

1964
01:44:59.959 --> 01:45:01.810
money selling those books and it was a bit

1965
01:45:01.819 --> 01:45:07.509
embarrassing. So, uh it's, it, it's a genuine problem,

1966
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.939
but the problem is there isn't anyone who can

1967
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:10.649
do anything about it. There isn't a pope, there

1968
01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.720
isn't a pope to say guys the entire scientific

1969
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:16.939
community, you're stop doing this or there will be

1970
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:20.640
consequences. Um So all we can, I think all

1971
01:45:20.649 --> 01:45:24.339
we can do is have um people like yourself

1972
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:28.339
holding science to account uh and asking those awkward

1973
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:32.950
questions and um you know, talking to people who

1974
01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:36.359
disagree with me as well, but we, we have

1975
01:45:36.370 --> 01:45:38.669
to have that level of scrutiny. Nothing would have

1976
01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.370
happened in the Weinstein case, for example, if Buzzfeed

1977
01:45:41.379 --> 01:45:44.069
hadn't, uh hadn't gone on to it, uh, because

1978
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:46.649
it became too embarrassing for Cornell not to do

1979
01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.220
anything about it. Uh

1980
01:45:49.629 --> 01:45:53.109
And uh, I mean, actually the nudge book, uh

1981
01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:59.430
reminded me of, uh Dan Arielle who I guess

1982
01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.149
I, I, if I, if I'm not mistaken, even

1983
01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.870
rec just recently published a new book and iii

1984
01:46:06.879 --> 01:46:10.509
I haven't even read the book. But after all

1985
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.779
the, the things that uh uh came out since

1986
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:18.609
2021 about these fraudulent data and all of that,

1987
01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:22.850
I would imagine that probably he's still promoting some

1988
01:46:22.859 --> 01:46:26.330
of his fake ideas as if

1989
01:46:26.339 --> 01:46:29.649
they were, but it's his business model. He can't,

1990
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:32.529
you know, he can't back away from that. He's

1991
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:36.000
committed to that view of the world in which

1992
01:46:36.259 --> 01:46:39.500
uh very small subtle interventions that only he knows

1993
01:46:39.509 --> 01:46:42.729
about, um, you know, make a difference. And it's,

1994
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.049
it's, it, you know, no, nobody else reproduces these

1995
01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.689
things. There's this whole thing of mindset theory. So

1996
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:50.490
the mindset theory is that, you know, students with

1997
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.120
a growth mindset, you know, achieve better. And it's

1998
01:46:54.129 --> 01:46:57.560
strange because this, the claim is that any teacher,

1999
01:46:57.689 --> 01:47:00.180
any school teacher can go into their class and

2000
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:04.160
apply this. But no psychologists have ever been able

2001
01:47:04.169 --> 01:47:06.640
to replicate it. So apparently it can be replicated

2002
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:09.200
freely by the person who invented it, any school

2003
01:47:09.209 --> 01:47:14.750
teacher, but no other psychologists. Um, AND, yeah, that

2004
01:47:14.759 --> 01:47:16.609
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

2005
01:47:16.859 --> 01:47:22.649
Um, AND the, um, the, the naive reader would

2006
01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:25.580
draw conclusions about that which, um, scientists are too

2007
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:32.160
polite, uh, to draw. But, uh, the, the people

2008
01:47:32.169 --> 01:47:33.890
reading the books aren't getting that they say, oh,

2009
01:47:33.899 --> 01:47:38.359
you know, I, there, there's this interesting research, my,

2010
01:47:38.379 --> 01:47:41.640
my colleagues and I, at university or whatever tested

2011
01:47:41.649 --> 01:47:44.500
this with 300 undergraduates. We found that when we

2012
01:47:44.509 --> 01:47:47.240
did this, they did that come by us. But,

2013
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.029
um, you know, did it happen? Is that what

2014
01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.939
really happened? Did they know what, you know, does

2015
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:55.490
that, can, we, can we really draw that conclusion?

2016
01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.560
Probably not. But I've got a book to sell.

2017
01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:01.720
Um, AND the, yeah, the nudge type stuff. Freakonomics.

2018
01:48:01.899 --> 01:48:07.430
Freakonomics is another one. THE, a lot of the,

2019
01:48:07.439 --> 01:48:10.279
what, what they write about, uh, is, is studies

2020
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:12.390
that either never happened or certainly didn't happen as

2021
01:48:12.399 --> 01:48:16.419
was described. Um, BUT that, again, that's that whole

2022
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:18.660
industry now, you know, there's that book, think like

2023
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:21.220
a freak and it's like, oh, the thing to

2024
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:25.549
do is to be counterintuitive. Everything is counterintuitive and

2025
01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.459
when the problem is when you get into everything

2026
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:30.189
being counterintuitive, well, then you're into Chem Trails and

2027
01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.540
five G and, and all that because, hey, that's

2028
01:48:32.549 --> 01:48:39.000
counterintuitive too. Um, AND you know why not? Who

2029
01:48:39.009 --> 01:48:44.250
says that can't be possible? Um, IT, it's very

2030
01:48:44.259 --> 01:48:46.879
dangerous, it's very dangerous. This idea that absolutely everything

2031
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:50.799
is counterintuitive cos actually most things are, you know,

2032
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:54.009
true on their face. Mhm.

2033
01:48:54.370 --> 01:48:57.879
Uh So uh ju ju just to, to wrap

2034
01:48:57.890 --> 01:49:00.620
up our conversation, let me just ask you, I

2035
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:04.310
guess one last question. So when it comes to

2036
01:49:04.319 --> 01:49:08.520
lay people specifically, if they are exposed to a

2037
01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:13.109
paper or to a piece of news on mainstream

2038
01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.529
media about some new a breakthrough research, something like

2039
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:20.649
that. I mean, do you think that there are

2040
01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.109
perhaps, or there would be good enough rules of

2041
01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.240
um even from uh for non experts to follow

2042
01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:34.120
where perhaps there would be some things they should

2043
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:38.359
be wary of things, they should pay specific attention

2044
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:42.234
to where if they see them, they should go.

2045
01:49:42.245 --> 01:49:46.254
OK. So this is, I should be careful about

2046
01:49:46.265 --> 01:49:49.375
this. This is sort of a preposterous claim. Let

2047
01:49:49.384 --> 01:49:53.044
me just take a step back and perhaps wait

2048
01:49:53.055 --> 01:49:56.725
a while to see if there are some reviews

2049
01:49:56.734 --> 01:50:01.064
and critiques that come out to see how it

2050
01:50:01.075 --> 01:50:04.720
turns out uh what experts actually we see about

2051
01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:06.930
it. Um I'll give a plug here for my

2052
01:50:06.939 --> 01:50:09.950
friend Stuart Richie's book called Science Fictions in which

2053
01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:13.729
he sort of, in which he, you know, tells,

2054
01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:16.859
gives you these steps to go through. But, uh,

2055
01:50:16.879 --> 01:50:19.370
I'm not very optimistic that, that many people will

2056
01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:21.470
want to do it because people are, people are

2057
01:50:21.479 --> 01:50:24.180
absorbing this on their commute into work. You know,

2058
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:25.875
in the, in the, in the, in the 20

2059
01:50:25.884 --> 01:50:29.555
minutes free newspaper, a new study shows, blah, blah,

2060
01:50:29.564 --> 01:50:32.564
blah. Next page, somebody got mugged in your neighborhood

2061
01:50:32.575 --> 01:50:35.564
last night. Next page, the football results. And it's

2062
01:50:35.575 --> 01:50:38.254
just part of the, it's just part of the

2063
01:50:38.265 --> 01:50:41.404
entertainment churn. And then, yeah, sometimes I'll be out,

2064
01:50:41.415 --> 01:50:42.895
I'll meet people on a walk or something and

2065
01:50:42.904 --> 01:50:45.205
they'll say, oh, I read that X, you know,

2066
01:50:45.214 --> 01:50:49.134
causes why. And it's like, hm. But sometimes people

2067
01:50:49.145 --> 01:50:52.410
will say, I don't believe any of it because

2068
01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.750
they're always telling you that this causes cancer and

2069
01:50:55.759 --> 01:50:58.779
then they're telling you that this cures cancer. Why

2070
01:50:58.790 --> 01:51:02.069
won't the scientists make up their minds? And I

2071
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:04.629
used to say, I used to say this isn't

2072
01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:07.839
the scientists, this is the journalists. Uh, BUT it

2073
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:10.129
turns out that a lot of it is the

2074
01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:12.350
scientists and I wish the scientists would stop doing

2075
01:51:12.359 --> 01:51:15.220
this. But the scientists will then say, oh yeah,

2076
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:17.890
but we didn't say that, you know, we had

2077
01:51:17.899 --> 01:51:20.339
this study and which said that this is associated

2078
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:25.000
with this in rats. Uh But they allowed their,

2079
01:51:25.009 --> 01:51:28.839
they allowed their study in rats to be turned

2080
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:32.799
into a news item. Um, AND they might even

2081
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:35.560
say, oh, well, the university press office obliged us

2082
01:51:35.569 --> 01:51:37.740
to it. It's like, well, you're not, not obliged

2083
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:40.899
to, you're not obliged. So you can choose not

2084
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:43.240
to do it. You went along with it because

2085
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:46.540
it was the easy thing to do. And then

2086
01:51:46.549 --> 01:51:49.549
they might say, yeah, but, you know, my university

2087
01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:54.149
ranks people on their public impact and they may

2088
01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.390
well be right. And so on the other hand,

2089
01:51:56.399 --> 01:51:59.910
it is quite difficult to critique people for their

2090
01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:04.339
uh behavior as scientists. It, it it's easy to

2091
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:06.470
critique them when they got a million dollar book

2092
01:52:06.479 --> 01:52:09.950
deal off the back of it. Understandable why they

2093
01:52:09.959 --> 01:52:11.660
would do that. But it's easy to critique them.

2094
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:13.649
It's less easy to critique them when they have

2095
01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:19.200
a precarious contract of employment. And they sincerely believe

2096
01:52:19.209 --> 01:52:21.120
that going along with a little bit of the

2097
01:52:21.129 --> 01:52:24.319
excess of the press department is the requirement to

2098
01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:27.490
still have a job paying them 2000 a month

2099
01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.109
or 4000 a month next year. And I think

2100
01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.500
we have to be a little bit careful about

2101
01:52:32.509 --> 01:52:36.069
dismissing sort of, you know, the, the incentives because

2102
01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:38.189
we see the results of the, you know, the

2103
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:42.629
high end thing and the $100,000 consulting gigs. But

2104
01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:44.589
we also have to acknowledge that there are lots

2105
01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.229
and lots of people who really want to keep

2106
01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.470
doing this line of work um and who are

2107
01:52:49.479 --> 01:52:51.129
prepared to do what it takes to stay in

2108
01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.750
that. It's one of the reasons why I think

2109
01:52:52.759 --> 01:52:56.069
we need to have fewer scientists, uh is because

2110
01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.279
once people are in that system, the system owes

2111
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:05.479
them an honest opportunity to keep going within that.

2112
01:53:05.490 --> 01:53:07.910
I think if you have any kind of uh

2113
01:53:07.919 --> 01:53:14.589
profession that isn't casual employment and you ask people

2114
01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.609
to make a commitment to being trained to do

2115
01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:22.270
that profession of engineer or, or lawyer or accountant.

2116
01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:27.200
I think it's incumbent on that profession, that domain

2117
01:53:27.209 --> 01:53:32.000
of human activity to have a reasonable opportunity for

2118
01:53:32.009 --> 01:53:36.339
people who've made that commitment to go for a

2119
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:40.759
decent length of career within that field where they

2120
01:53:40.770 --> 01:53:44.640
chose to give up their twenties, getting trained. And

2121
01:53:44.649 --> 01:53:46.799
at the moment, we have a situation where we,

2122
01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:49.629
we train all these scientists but there simply isn't

2123
01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:53.549
enough stable employment for them. And as a result,

2124
01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.759
we make them jump through hoops and, you know,

2125
01:53:56.770 --> 01:54:01.620
perform little tricks to stay, um, in, uh which,

2126
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:03.100
which first of all means we select for the

2127
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:05.080
people who are best at doing the little tricks,

2128
01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:08.060
but also the whole premise was, well, we'll push

2129
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:10.089
all these phd s through the system and we'll,

2130
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.020
we'll cream off the 15 or 20% best ones.

2131
01:54:13.029 --> 01:54:16.250
You shouldn't be doing that. You should be selecting

2132
01:54:16.259 --> 01:54:20.779
people much more rigorously for their potential to be,

2133
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:23.319
have a good long career as scientists. And I'm,

2134
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:25.819
I if you go along to law school and

2135
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:28.600
you're just not up to, you know, whatever I

2136
01:54:28.609 --> 01:54:30.839
don't know what the qualifications are or what. But

2137
01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:33.009
I'm sure there are ways, I'm sure there are

2138
01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:34.720
people who go to law school and after two

2139
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:38.259
months, you know, people around them will realize, look

2140
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.359
sorry, but you're never gonna make it in the

2141
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:43.490
law, you know, because of the way your mind

2142
01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:48.080
works or whatever it is. And, you know, hopefully,

2143
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:51.060
well, you failed them perhaps. I don't know. Uh,

2144
01:54:51.069 --> 01:54:53.450
BUT we, we, we, it seems to me that

2145
01:54:53.459 --> 01:54:55.509
in science that is completely out of whack and

2146
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.689
we're bringing in so many people and then they,

2147
01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.799
they, they wanna continue in what they're doing. But

2148
01:54:59.970 --> 01:55:02.930
that's, I think a legitimate social contract with people

2149
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:06.049
now who is running that system. I don't know.

2150
01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:09.270
But worlds of, I don't know, don't know about

2151
01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:11.549
journalism but words of engineering law and things like

2152
01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.839
that when we bring you into the system, the

2153
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:17.060
deal is that if you pass the exams with

2154
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:20.100
a reasonable degree of competency, there will very likely

2155
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:23.839
be a job for you somewhere. And that simply

2156
01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:26.859
isn't the case in science. Um And so I,

2157
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:30.109
as I say, my, my fundamental that everything I've

2158
01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.830
told you in the last two hours, you could

2159
01:55:31.839 --> 01:55:33.879
have heard from a dozen other people apart from

2160
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:37.720
perhaps my position that we need to train vastly

2161
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:41.459
fewer scientists than we currently do. Not because the

2162
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:44.000
world might not be a better place with all

2163
01:55:44.009 --> 01:55:46.279
those scientists, but because we simply don't have room

2164
01:55:46.290 --> 01:55:49.569
for them. We don't have the capacity to absorb

2165
01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:53.270
either the people or anything they might output. Uh,

2166
01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:55.700
AND we just have to accept that in the

2167
01:55:55.709 --> 01:56:00.229
same way that we don't put, um, 20,000 kids

2168
01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.729
a year through professional football academies. Mhm. You know,

2169
01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:09.209
your, uh, whatever your favorite football team is has

2170
01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:14.979
an academy and they know they know that 90%

2171
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:17.939
of the 14 year olds won't make it. 70%

2172
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:20.330
of the 16 year olds won't make it. But

2173
01:56:20.339 --> 01:56:24.140
they don't, they could, they could take in three

2174
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:28.629
times as many kids. And occasionally, you know, the

2175
01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.200
ones who they, let's say at the moment they

2176
01:56:30.209 --> 01:56:31.939
take in the ones who score nine out of

2177
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:33.770
10, they could take in all the ones who

2178
01:56:33.779 --> 01:56:36.580
currently score eight out of 10. Occasionally, one or

2179
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:39.430
two of those would blossom and become 16 year

2180
01:56:39.439 --> 01:56:41.370
olds and go on to become professional. But the

2181
01:56:41.379 --> 01:56:43.839
trail they would lead in there and there's a,

2182
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:47.020
the cost of doing it. But there's also, I

2183
01:56:47.029 --> 01:56:49.879
think a certain moral obligation within that field to

2184
01:56:49.890 --> 01:56:52.589
say, look, the chances that he or that this

2185
01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.660
person will make it as, as a profession are

2186
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:58.160
so low that we're going to take the risk

2187
01:56:58.169 --> 01:57:00.620
of missing out on the next Lionel Messi because,

2188
01:57:00.959 --> 01:57:02.540
you know, we just have to do that. And

2189
01:57:02.549 --> 01:57:04.259
it's, I at the moment it's as if it's

2190
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:07.470
as if your local football team had Tween took

2191
01:57:07.479 --> 01:57:10.359
2030 times more people than they need into the

2192
01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:13.000
academy. 14 year olds go, hey, I'm at the

2193
01:57:13.009 --> 01:57:16.229
FC, whatever academy. That's fantastic. And, and you go,

2194
01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:19.700
yeah, you're not gonna, you do know it's very

2195
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:22.120
unlikely. And I think we would, if that was

2196
01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:24.560
happening we would consider that there was an ethical,

2197
01:57:24.979 --> 01:57:27.680
an ethical problem. Maybe there already is. Maybe they're

2198
01:57:27.689 --> 01:57:29.560
already training to me. I don't know. But we

2199
01:57:29.569 --> 01:57:31.479
would, you know, we would be talking about that

2200
01:57:31.799 --> 01:57:33.319
and I, I don't think we talk about that

2201
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:36.359
in, in science. I'm not certain why or outside

2202
01:57:36.370 --> 01:57:40.060
science, maybe that's your next kind of investigative mission

2203
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:41.979
is why are we, why do we train so

2204
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:46.859
many scientists? Because we have so many professors because

2205
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:48.669
they were trained as scientists. You know, we've got

2206
01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:51.660
this, we've got this huge machine and it has

2207
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:54.970
to be kept going and we, in our society,

2208
01:57:54.979 --> 01:58:00.319
we associate any machine getting smaller as a sign

2209
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:04.479
of failure, right? You know, why have half the

2210
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:10.000
psychology departments in our universities closed? There's not going

2211
01:58:10.009 --> 01:58:11.790
to be an article saying actually this is a

2212
01:58:11.799 --> 01:58:16.270
good thing, you know, it's going to be interviews

2213
01:58:16.279 --> 01:58:19.700
with the people who lost their jobs and, and

2214
01:58:19.709 --> 01:58:22.379
my, my kind of assertion is that we shouldn't

2215
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:23.990
have hired a lot of those people in the

2216
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.080
first place. But this will, this will, this, this

2217
01:58:27.089 --> 01:58:29.029
doesn't make me too popular. I'm surprised that it

2218
01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.549
doesn't make me more unpopular, but it doesn't. Yeah.

2219
01:58:32.899 --> 01:58:35.200
No, no one's no-one's yet invited me on their

2220
01:58:35.209 --> 01:58:37.990
podcast to give a good, full 45 minute exposition

2221
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.629
of exactly how I think that should work.

2222
01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:45.859
Well, I, it's food for thought. Anyway, I guess

2223
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:48.939
let's end on that note. And Doctor Brown, uh,

2224
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:51.819
just before we go, would you like to tell

2225
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:54.990
people where they can find you when you work

2226
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:55.979
on the internet?

2227
01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:59.430
So, I'm still on Twitter and, uh, you can

2228
01:58:59.439 --> 01:59:00.770

2229
01:59:00.779 --> 01:59:02.890
spell it, it'll you um you can put my

2230
01:59:02.899 --> 01:59:05.330
Twitter handle on there. I, I suppose at some

2231
01:59:05.339 --> 01:59:07.080
point I will move over to blue sky like

2232
01:59:07.089 --> 01:59:11.859
everybody else. Um And one or other of those

2233
01:59:12.339 --> 01:59:14.779
uh will be the best place to contact me.

2234
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:18.220
And if not, um Ricardo, you can put, for

2235
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:22.129
example, the address of my blog um in the

2236
01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:25.560
in the blurb and um people will be able

2237
01:59:25.569 --> 01:59:28.020
to find my contact details through that.

2238
01:59:29.490 --> 01:59:33.470
OK? So I'm leaving links to that in the

2239
01:59:33.479 --> 01:59:36.339
