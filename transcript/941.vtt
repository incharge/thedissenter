00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.779
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.510
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.359
joined by Doctor Anthony Volk. He is professor in

4
00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.260
the Department of Child and Youth Studies and associate

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.600
member in the Department of Psychology at Brock University

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.409
is interests include bullying, parenting, personality, psychopathy, and evolution

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.559
of childhood. And today we're focusing mostly on bullying

8
00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.569
from an evolutionary and developmental perspective. So Dr Volk,

9
00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.649
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to

10
00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.100
everyone.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.259
Hi. Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.189
Ok. So let's start perhaps with the basic question

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.369
here. So uh from the perspective of psychology, scientific

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.450
psychology here, let's say, what is bullying? How do

15
00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:49.450
you operationalize it exactly?

16
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.150
That's a good question. And uh it, it it's

17
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.419
fair to say that it's still a topic of

18
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.860
debate in the field. Uh How do we actually

19
00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:06.459
define bullying? The major criteria that we use for

20
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610
defining bullying is that bullying is a goal directed

21
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.870
behavior. So it has a degree of intentionality, but

22
00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.480
we don't try to assess intentionality because that's a

23
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:20.309
very difficult behavior if you did this, not by

24
00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.580
accident, whether it was for fun for uh power

25
00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:28.269
for pleasure. That's a key element. Secondly, it has

26
00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:31.790
to be harmful, so it can't be trivial. So

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.870
uh the behavior has to actually cause some kind

28
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.620
of lasting impact for individuals. And we know that

29
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.750
in many cases, bullying has very serious impacts. And

30
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.379
then lastly, um it has to have a power

31
00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.989
imbalance and the power imbalance is something that is

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.569
difficult to capture and measure. But essentially, it means

33
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.709
that the individual who's being targeted has a difficult

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.069
time fighting back. So bullying is goal directed, harmful

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.209
behavior that uh is captured in a particular power

36
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.809
and balance at the moment that is uh behaved.

37
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.339
Mhm And how do you approach it from a

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.979
developmental and evolutionary perspectives?

39
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.110
So that's a great question. Um One of the

40
00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.389
things that really got me started along this route

41
00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.789
was when I was looking at World Health Organization

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.009
data, um they measure bullying across countries and I

43
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.250
was part of the study in 2005 that was

44
00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.910
looking at Canadian data and we found that uh

45
00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:46.110
individuals who bullied had better mental health than people

46
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.710
who weren't involved in bullying, which at the time

47
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660
I wondered if I was making a mistake with

48
00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.669
the data. Um I was just a graduate student

49
00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.960
but it was true um that these individuals actually

50
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.339
had better mental health, which went against the common

51
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.520
idea at the time that bullies were socially maladjusted

52
00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.279
individuals who didn't know how to behave. And in

53
00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.639
fact spoke to the fact that these are people

54
00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:16.509
who had skills for doing what they were doing.

55
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.830
So maybe there is a reason behind this. And

56
00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.630
then when you follow that up with the logic

57
00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.250
that you find bullying in virtually every society that's

58
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.020
been measured historical or present. Uh It suggests that

59
00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.139
either this is development that's gone wrong on a

60
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.830
consistent and global level, or there might actually be

61
00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.470
some reason why people are engaging in this behavior.

62
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.240
So, from an evolutionary perspective, do you think that

63
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.869
there's good enough evidence to make the case that

64
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.880
it's perhaps a, a form of adaptive behavior?

65
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.850
Again, another really good question uh was if this

66
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.570
is not maladaptive behavior, what's in it for the

67
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.639
people who are doing it? And I want to

68
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.669
be clear about a few different categories. Uh PEOPLE

69
00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.880
who are victimized, uh If you want to talk

70
00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.809
about them can suffer some really serious consequences. Uh

71
00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.519
You know, one of the analogies I like to

72
00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:21.160
use is that breaking a bone is something that

73
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.019
is gonna cause permanent stress. If you exercise, um

74
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.970
you will increase the density of your bone, but

75
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.959
if you break it, you cause permanent damage. And

76
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.500
that's what we see with bullying. The idea that

77
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.269
conflict is bad isn't necessarily true, but high levels

78
00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.329
of conflict for individuals are really bad. So that's

79
00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.299
not adaptive. Individuals who are bullies and victims at

80
00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.399
the same time are also not very adaptive um

81
00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.779
because they suffer from the same consequences as victimization

82
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.489
and they're the ones who fit the stereotype that

83
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.480
we think of people without self control, good social

84
00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:58.899
skills, et cetera. But actual pure bullies who are

85
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.329
the majority of bullies and who conduct the majority

86
00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.410
of bullying. So people who are bullies and not

87
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.589
bullied in return, they seem to have a lot

88
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.029
of benefits. Um AND we, we can talk about

89
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.309
specifically what those are. But the reality is that

90
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.429
these individuals, as I said, don't have mental health

91
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.339
issues, they don't have self esteem issues, they don't

92
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.239
have social uh cognitive issues. So they're, they have

93
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.470
good social skills and they seem to get some

94
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.850
really important benefits that are leading us to suggest

95
00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:29.589
that this might be an adaptive behavior.

96
00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:34.079
So before we get into some of the advantages,

97
00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:40.839
particularly from an evolutionary perspective, what characterizes adolescent bullying,

98
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.869
specifically

99
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.369
bullying is something that is, again, it's a form

100
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.170
of behavior that carries an advantage in a power

101
00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:56.260
imbalance. And so there's many, many different ways of

102
00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:59.839
looking at bullying. Um One example that's gotten a

103
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.500
lot of attention recently is cyber bullying where there's

104
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.859
bullying that happens online, but bullying can be physical,

105
00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.410
it can be verbal, it can be indirect where

106
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.079
you are excluding people or isolating people uh to

107
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.179
cause them harm. So there are many different ways

108
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.519
that bullying presents itself um in adolescence is particularly

109
00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:24.179
important because this is when we see the largest

110
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.940
spike in bullying behavior. So longitudinal studies of aggression

111
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.049
in general show that we are most aggressive when

112
00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.359
we're three or four years old, we haven't learned

113
00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:37.309
how to uh behave with other people. But bullying

114
00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.700
actually peaks not when we're three or four years

115
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:43.320
old, it peaks when we're about 14 or 15.

116
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.880
Um And that's something that makes adolescent bullying particularly

117
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.239
important for studying because not only is this a

118
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.160
peak time for bullying to behave, but we know

119
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.170
adolescents in general is when a lot of behaviors

120
00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:03.630
become uh cemented or locked in or less plastic

121
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.049
as we move to adulthood. So understanding why some

122
00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:11.940
people behave in this behavior uh allows us in

123
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.399
adolescence to predict adult behavior uh much more efficiently

124
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.410
than childhood behavior.

125
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.299
But are there particular aspects of adolescent bullying that

126
00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:27.980
distinguish it from bullying in other stages of life?

127
00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:32.519
Like for example, in childhood and adulthood and o

128
00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:33.619
other stages,

129
00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:37.089
one of the really important things that we've talked

130
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.390
about in um adolescent bullying is the goals that

131
00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.480
are underlying bullying. And so certainly one of the

132
00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:49.339
major reasons why we think bullying happens. There was

133
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.450
a lively debate and a good debate of whether

134
00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:56.269
bullying peaked because you had the uh social order

135
00:07:56.279 --> 00:08:00.170
disrupted when you went from middle school to high

136
00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:04.019
school or whatever the equivalent is in many Western

137
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.299
countries. But that doesn't seem to explain it. What

138
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:10.760
seems to explain it is the age related changes

139
00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:13.190
So it's not school related, it's age related. And

140
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.230
we think that that's because one of the big

141
00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:17.850
things that comes online in adolescence that doesn't exist

142
00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:25.100
in childhood is uh the intersexual behavior of adolescents.

143
00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:28.079
So, you know, in English we say, you know,

144
00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:31.540
there's cooties and that the other sex when you're

145
00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:33.820
young are not people you want to interact with,

146
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.570
they're not people you want to spend time with.

147
00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.330
But then by the time you're an adolescent, it

148
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.190
starts becoming important on average recognizing people with different

149
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.349
uh sexual Proclivities. But on average, it becomes important

150
00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.229
to start interacting with people from the opposite sex.

151
00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:52.700
And that's a major drive of bullying that we

152
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.820
believe differing from adulthood as you get older, uh

153
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.539
physical bullying becomes less common for two reasons. Uh

154
00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:06.719
One physical bullying between older adolescents is more severe

155
00:09:06.729 --> 00:09:09.330
than between younger Children. So if a couple of

156
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.039
eight year olds are punching each other, you might

157
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:14.309
get a couple of bruises. Couple of 18 year

158
00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:17.489
old men are hitting each other, you break jaws,

159
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.400
right? So the consequences are more severe and because

160
00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:24.340
of that, it's harder to hide. So we see

161
00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:27.669
in adolescence a decrease in physical bullying um on

162
00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.630
average, but overall we see an increase in bullying

163
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.940
um because we think that these stakes have gotten

164
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.150
higher as the dating game um kicks into gear

165
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:40.840
and individuals are competing more strongly than they did

166
00:09:40.849 --> 00:09:41.309
as Children

167
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.780
is bullying related to personality in any way? I

168
00:09:46.789 --> 00:09:50.890
mean, are there specific personality traits that predispose people

169
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.570
to becoming bullies?

170
00:09:54.349 --> 00:09:57.929
Yeah, we like to look at development. Uh YOU

171
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.229
know, the analogy that I use is what's more

172
00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.289
important for making a chocolate chip cookie. Is it

173
00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:06.450
having chocolate or is it having an oven? You,

174
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.289
you need both? So it's always the combination of

175
00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:13.789
the environment um and individual predispositions and when it

176
00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:17.260
comes to eat individual predispositions, personality is one of

177
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.429
those factors that we know that has a genetic

178
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.210
uh influence on its expression. And in particular, we

179
00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:26.640
use the Hexaco model um of bullying or sorry

180
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.289
of personality. And the Hexaco model is different from

181
00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:35.140
other dimensions. And in that it has honesty, humility,

182
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.650
the age at the start of the Hexaco and

183
00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:41.429
honesty, humility predicts your willingness to exploit others versus

184
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.960
your willingness to pass on exploiting others. So if

185
00:10:44.969 --> 00:10:49.369
you see a wallet with uh €100 lying on

186
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.330
the street, do you take those €100 or do

187
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.739
you try and return them to somebody else? And

188
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.369
there's advantages from an evolutionary perspective to both behaviors.

189
00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:01.000
If you give them back, you're being co-operative. If

190
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.119
you keep that €100 then you are being um

191
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.840
selfishly helping yourself. And that's the personality trait that

192
00:11:08.849 --> 00:11:13.840
we find that best predicts bullying, perpetration, it's not

193
00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:16.830
emotional empathy. So feeling what other people feel is

194
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.859
not a great predictor of bullying, it's not being

195
00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:23.080
angry, that's not a great predictor of bullying. Um

196
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.099
TO a lesser extent, being impulsive is part of

197
00:11:27.109 --> 00:11:31.799
uh predicting what bullying is. So that's conscientiousness. But

198
00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:36.780
across cultures primarily, it's having low honesty humility, which

199
00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:40.599
is the belief that you deserve better than others.

200
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.880
And that means that when it comes to bullying

201
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.320
other people, they're getting what they deserve because they're

202
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.159
not as good as you. They're not as smart,

203
00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:51.260
they're not as strong, they're not as clever, they're

204
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.510
not as popular. And so these people deserve uh

205
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.750
the treatment that you give them and you deserve

206
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.330
to benefit by their expense. And that's really the

207
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.010
trait that most strongly predicts uh bullying behavior.

208
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.400
And so what sorts of evolutionary advantages would bullying

209
00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:15.099
behavior have?

210
00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:20.330
So we're looking to try and describe the specific

211
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.460
kinds of advantages that they have. We know from

212
00:12:24.469 --> 00:12:29.210
a wide array of longitudinal. Uh SO over time

213
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.289
and international cross cultural data that a major advantage

214
00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:39.630
that bullying provides is it leads to popularity. Um

215
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.700
So individuals who bully are more likely to become

216
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:50.270
popular over time and popularity is important to differentiate

217
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.530
from likability. So it doesn't necessarily mean that people

218
00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:56.750
like you. Um BUT it means that they recognize

219
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.599
that you have social power and that you are

220
00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:02.130
capable of influencing the peer group. So that's a

221
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.750
very common behavior that we've or outcome I should

222
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.919
say that we've seen uh across time and across

223
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:12.450
cultures around the world. Bullying can also get you

224
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.770
material resources. So you can edge out competitors from

225
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.440
the best spot in the playground, the best seat

226
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.950
at the lunch cafeteria, um scholarship opportunities. Uh YOU

227
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.919
know, in academia, you can try and edge people

228
00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:32.150
out of grants. Um So bullying can provide material

229
00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:35.809
resources as well as social resources. And then lastly,

230
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.619
and most importantly, from an evolutionary perspective, uh it

231
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.539
can provide reproductive advantages. So we know that bullying

232
00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:47.450
is associated with increased frequency of dating and having

233
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.750
sex as adolescence. Um And I can say that

234
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.830
we literally yesterday just submitted a paper showing that

235
00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.270
adolescents who bully 10 years on have more Children.

236
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.869
Um So we longitudinally have shown that it is

237
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.270
associated with having uh more of your genes being

238
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.489
passed on to the next generation. So there's some

239
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.880
really potent advantages for being involved with bullying.

240
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.989
So in the particular case of dating and mating

241
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.950
opportunities, what would be the rationale here? I mean,

242
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:33.590
for, for example, potential mating partners, why would females,

243
00:14:33.599 --> 00:14:37.309
for example, feel attracted to bullies?

244
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.500
That's a really good question that we are wondering

245
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.469
ourselves and some of our data has helped answer

246
00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:47.619
that. Um So why would you want to be

247
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.179
involved with somebody who's antisocial and takes advantage of

248
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.169
their power? You would think that would be bad

249
00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:56.169
for the individual and it might be um we

250
00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:59.859
see mixed evidence about the quality of relationships that

251
00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:02.359
they have as adults. But one of the things

252
00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:04.989
that we found that was surprising is they actually

253
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.700
invest more in their offspring. Um So let me

254
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.179
ask about how much effort do you put into

255
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.619
mating? How much effort you put into parenting and

256
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.690
how much effort you put into yourself or somatic

257
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.169
effort? Police report putting more effort into parenting. And

258
00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:20.840
these are uh at least in Canada, we talk

259
00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:25.020
about soccer moms or football moms and hockey dads.

260
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.719
Um These you can imagine are the people who

261
00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:30.210
are yelling from the sideline, bullying the coach to

262
00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:33.349
play their kid. Um TELLING the teacher that their

263
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:36.369
child needs more time and attention and this is

264
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.409
advantageous for passing on your genes. You have somebody

265
00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:43.119
who is going to selfishly fight for their Children

266
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.530
who are also related to you. So you have

267
00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:50.659
somebody who is securing resources at the same time

268
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:52.729
as they are passing them on to your Children

269
00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:56.760
and, and somebody who uh I like to use

270
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.520
as a case model for bullying Donald Trump. Uh

271
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.989
He's married three supermodels. Uh So he's had success

272
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.809
in attracting uh at least by some measures, high

273
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.890
quality mates and he has the potential to invest

274
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.650
millions of dollars in each of them. And that's,

275
00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:16.400
that's a potent advantage. If you're willing and able

276
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:21.049
to secure resources for your offspring, then that's something

277
00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:24.609
that's potentially advantageous for somebody to partner with.

278
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.450
And does bullying have anything to do with power

279
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.320
and balances of power?

280
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:37.090
Power is what differentiates bullying from regular aggression. Um

281
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:42.679
So one of the really interesting things that we

282
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.559
thought about once we started looking at bullying as

283
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.380
an evolutionary advantage is why does it happen? Dominance,

284
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.750
hierarchies are supposed to reduce the competition. So that

285
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.450
number one and number 17 don't fight number 17

286
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.150
isn't a threat to number one and number 17

287
00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.770
isn't gonna be able to beat number one. So

288
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.439
why would you have this power and balance? We

289
00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:07.699
think it's because bullying is about a signal to

290
00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:11.089
the group or the individuals who are involved in

291
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:14.608
it. And so number one isn't picking on number

292
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:18.170
17 because they need the resources of number 17.

293
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.868
Number one is picking on number 17 to show

294
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.118
number two and number three, what they are capable

295
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.079
of, they are capable of aggression. They are capable

296
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.770
of beating somebody who's a near level peer. So

297
00:17:31.949 --> 00:17:34.290
the power imbalance doesn't work if you have an

298
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.300
18 year old who's beating up an eight year

299
00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:39.550
old that's not going to impress anybody, but an

300
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.609
18 year old who can beat up another 18

301
00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:43.900
year old or a 17 year old is sending

302
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.569
a signal of this is what happens if you

303
00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:49.530
interact with me, I'm willing to be aggressive and

304
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.790
I'm capable of doing damage. And studies from the

305
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.839
Netherlands have shown that uh first that power and

306
00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:03.630
popularity are predictors of future bullying. So the phrase

307
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.939
that power corrupts appears to be true. Um And

308
00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:11.420
secondly, that bullies rotate through victims and those who

309
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.959
rotate through victims gain more popularity because they're sending

310
00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:18.729
more signals. So in biology, there's a, a term

311
00:18:18.739 --> 00:18:21.869
about honest signaling. The idea that if you send

312
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.319
a signal, it has to be something that can

313
00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:28.010
easily be faked. So it's costly to send this

314
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.449
signal. And so it is costly for an 18

315
00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:32.439
year old to fight with another 18 year old

316
00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:35.420
that their 18 year old could fight back physically,

317
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:41.089
uh emotionally, intellectually. But by virtue of having a

318
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.849
power and balance to start with, it makes it

319
00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:46.750
less costly for the bully to send that signal.

320
00:18:46.969 --> 00:18:50.170
Like the right the most powerful signal a bully

321
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.229
could send would be for an 18 year old

322
00:18:52.239 --> 00:18:55.800
to beat up the best mixed martial artist fighter

323
00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:58.410
or the strongest debater on the planet. But that's

324
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.829
a really costly signal. So they don't try to

325
00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:04.619
aim that high. Instead they find the right balance

326
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:09.180
between an individual who has some cost to defeat

327
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:11.430
but is not so costly that they can fight

328
00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:14.140
back. And research again has shown the bullies are

329
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.500
really good at picking individuals who can't hurt their

330
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.650
popularity for whatever reason, because of their physical stature,

331
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.189
their mental stature, their social stature, but they are

332
00:19:24.199 --> 00:19:27.369
still at a level that sends a signal that

333
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.089
the bully is not somebody to, to interact with.

334
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.410
So another important question here, I guess is are

335
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.069
there sex differences in bullying behavior that is, do

336
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:44.670
female bullies differ from male bullies. And I guess

337
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.810
in this case, both in terms of their, of

338
00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:51.180
the frequency of their bullying, but also in terms

339
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:54.209
of their bullying behaviors specifically.

340
00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:58.839
So, uh the first thing I'll say is one

341
00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:01.229
of the things that surprised us, particularly when we

342
00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:05.439
talk about bullying um outcomes and the advantages of

343
00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:07.910
being a bully is that there aren't major sex

344
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.910
differences between individuals. Um So it's not simply that

345
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.589
women prefer strong men. And that's the end of

346
00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:17.630
the story. Um THAT female bullies enjoy the same

347
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.900
reproductive advantages, same social advantages and the same material

348
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.280
advantages that male bullies do. But there are differences

349
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.430
in how uh individuals bully and this is true

350
00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:33.719
for uh almost all kinds of aggression is that

351
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.150
male bullies are much more likely to engage in

352
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.280
physical bullying, physical bullying is risky. Uh You know,

353
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.359
as I mentioned earlier, 18 year olds who are

354
00:20:41.369 --> 00:20:46.150
fighting can break jaws, um break bones grown men.

355
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.530
You know, it's a very serious and risky endeavor.

356
00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:53.849
An evolutionary theory has repeatedly suggested and I think

357
00:20:53.859 --> 00:20:57.459
provided evidence for the fact that because women are

358
00:20:57.469 --> 00:21:00.819
typically the primary caregivers, they are less likely to

359
00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:03.890
engage in those really seriously risky kinds of behavior.

360
00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:08.989
Beyond that, you find that boys and girls engage

361
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.660
in almost equal levels of bullying. So if you

362
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.310
take out physical bullying, uh you find that girls

363
00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:19.790
engage in about 1 to 2% more uh relational

364
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.550
bullying. So indirect attacking reputations than boys do. But

365
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.920
it's a very small difference whereas physical aggression is

366
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.239
about boys engaged, but 100% more uh bullying. So

367
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.239
the forms that they use are are different, but

368
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.699
the goals and the outcomes seem to be very

369
00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:38.119
similar

370
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.599
and and the levels then do not vary much

371
00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:44.520
between males and females.

372
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.219
Once you control for physical bullying, the levels are

373
00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:53.069
virtually identical. Um So uh you find bullying is

374
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:56.500
more common amongst boys because this added layer of

375
00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.369
physical bullying that boys do. Um But once you

376
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.599
take that out of the equation, which isn't trivial.

377
00:22:02.609 --> 00:22:03.989
So I don't want to say that boys and

378
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.699
girls are equal because boys do engage in more

379
00:22:06.709 --> 00:22:09.280
bullying than girls do. But once you remove the

380
00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.160
physical bullying, then the two sexes are more or

381
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:12.760
less equal.

382
00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:18.020
And what about the victims themselves? I mean, what

383
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.069
kinds of people do? Bullies tend to target? And

384
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:26.010
are there also sex differences when it comes to

385
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.569
the targets? Each sex tends to choose as victims?

386
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.300
Yeah. Uh The short answer is bullies choose targets

387
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.770
who are easy to attack and that can depend

388
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.530
on the bully characteristics and the individual's characteristics. An

389
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.709
example that I like to use is Lou Ferigno

390
00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:50.219
who's an American bodybuilder at the same time as

391
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.359
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Um HE was the incredible Hulk when

392
00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:58.510
they just painted him green, so massive individual and

393
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.020
he was bullied relentlessly, a huge man. Uh BECAUSE

394
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.469
he had a hearing disability. So people would make

395
00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:09.150
fun of the way he talked and his inability

396
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.270
to quickly follow conversations. And that's not something you

397
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.530
can punch your way out of. That's not something

398
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.520
that you can physically uh overcome. And it was

399
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.400
a weakness that bullies were able to exploit. And

400
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.420
so bullies are really effective at finding the right

401
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.699
weakness in victims. And you might ask, why do

402
00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:35.329
victims exist, why do they, why do they happen?

403
00:23:36.449 --> 00:23:41.540
The reality is that we're a social species. And

404
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.439
one of the saddest incidents of bullying that I've

405
00:23:44.449 --> 00:23:47.150
seen uh Wendy Craig and Deb Pepper did a

406
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.599
study where it was a, you know, BBC documentary

407
00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:53.300
like David Attenborough where they put microphones on kids

408
00:23:53.489 --> 00:23:57.219
and followed them around the playground. And you see

409
00:23:57.229 --> 00:23:59.680
a young girl who gets grabbed by a group

410
00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:01.560
of older girls and they start beating her up

411
00:24:01.569 --> 00:24:04.329
and kicking her on the ground, an adult walks

412
00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:07.119
by. So they stop and she, the girl has

413
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.329
a chance to get up and walk away. Two

414
00:24:09.339 --> 00:24:11.819
minutes later, she walks back to the group and

415
00:24:11.829 --> 00:24:13.550
they grab her and start kicking her and throwing

416
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.660
her to the ground again. And you say, why

417
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.040
would this person ever want to be bullied and

418
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.569
kicked? Why don't they just stay away? And the

419
00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:25.189
reality is that for humans being left alone is

420
00:24:25.199 --> 00:24:30.040
a death sentence uh in ancestral times. So these

421
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.160
individuals are faced with the choice of either get

422
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.859
this really negative attention or be left alone. And

423
00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:39.500
sadly, a lot of these kids, I, I don't

424
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.459
want to use the word choose in that this

425
00:24:41.469 --> 00:24:43.859
is what they want to do, but they're left

426
00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:47.939
with a dilemma of either I am completely alone

427
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:51.530
or I get negative attention. And that's unfortunately, what

428
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.209
leads to a lot of victims being targeted. We

429
00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:59.290
know that people who are victimized uh have on

430
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.400
average lower self esteem, uh and more emotional and

431
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.949
anxiety problems. And we know that bullying causes more

432
00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:10.410
emotional anxiety problems. Some of the most damning evidence

433
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.170
against victims and victimization. Why it matters is that

434
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.239
it affects the expression of your immune system for

435
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.800
30 years after being bullied. So there are large

436
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.900
epigenetic which means the expression of your genes are

437
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.670
being changed. Uh It effects it last for decades.

438
00:25:29.239 --> 00:25:31.939
And the kids who are being victimized are really

439
00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:34.599
put in a difficult spot and, and just go

440
00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:37.290
a little further. One of the common, the most

441
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.079
common recommendation for stopping bullying is getting the victims

442
00:25:42.089 --> 00:25:44.800
to fight back and that of course, makes them

443
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.880
more costly to target. And that is the single

444
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.810
most effective way to stop bullying. The problem is

445
00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:54.969
that's also the single most effective way to make

446
00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:57.959
bullying worse. Because if you put the bully in

447
00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:00.589
a spot where they are losing face, they're losing

448
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:03.359
status, they're losing their chance to get dates, then

449
00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:08.489
they fight back even harder. And so asking individuals

450
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.430
to fight back and defend themselves is asking individuals

451
00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:15.680
who are already chosen because they're in a disadvantage.

452
00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:19.390
They have either a limited physical strength or social

453
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.900
strength or intellectual strength to fight back. It's putting

454
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.099
the position where that can backfire on them. And

455
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:33.770
the reality is that these individuals are not in

456
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.069
a spot where there is a fair fight to

457
00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:39.910
gain back. And again, I use the example when

458
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.400
a lot of people say, well, I was somebody

459
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.979
picked on me and I fought back. It is

460
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.750
good for Children to experience stress that makes them

461
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.579
more resilient and stronger. Same thing happens with your

462
00:26:52.589 --> 00:26:55.939
bones that if you exercise your bones become stronger

463
00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:58.420
over time. But if you go past a certain

464
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.229
limit, both with your bones and with your emotional

465
00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:04.560
capacity, you have a break and that break is

466
00:27:04.569 --> 00:27:07.910
never as strong as it was before. So Children

467
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.319
who are victimized uh are like Children who have

468
00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:13.479
a broken arm or a broken leg, that arm

469
00:27:13.489 --> 00:27:15.060
or leg will never be as strong as it

470
00:27:15.069 --> 00:27:17.930
was before. And that's why we see these decades

471
00:27:17.939 --> 00:27:21.270
long experiences for most people, a small amount of

472
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.969
conflict or a small amount of aggression towards you

473
00:27:24.479 --> 00:27:28.260
will help you be more resilient. But for Children

474
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.319
who are victimized, this intense behavior that we've unfortunately

475
00:27:33.329 --> 00:27:35.959
seen can cause Children to, to kill themselves because

476
00:27:35.969 --> 00:27:40.050
they, they feel so pressured is causing really severe

477
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.479
damage. So it's really important for me to emphasize

478
00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:46.709
that while bullying may have adaptive advantages for bullies,

479
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.290
it is extremely costly for victims and the victims

480
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.709
or individuals who have been chosen because they can't

481
00:27:55.719 --> 00:27:58.770
fight back effectively. And again, research shows us that

482
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.349
bullies are very strategic in who they target. If

483
00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:06.160
you have a small uh physically weak bully, they

484
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.020
will attack somebody who's socially isolated. If you have

485
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.560
a physically strong bully, they'll attack somebody who's physically

486
00:28:11.569 --> 00:28:15.229
isolated or, or, or weaker. So it is really

487
00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:18.910
important for us to differentiate between the idea that

488
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.260
bullying can be adapted for those who use it

489
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.989
while still really costly for the victims and for

490
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.829
society in general. Um AS a behavior.

491
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.750
Mhm. So, I mean, there are probably particular cases,

492
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:39.310
particular extreme cases where the psychological damage to the

493
00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:44.329
victims would be like permanent, I mean, would would

494
00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:46.430
last for the rest of their lives.

495
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.510
Uh uh Yes. Uh AND the data shows that

496
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.079
that there are that mental health effects from bullying

497
00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:57.400
last for decades. We don't have an entire life

498
00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.119
data yet, but we know that 30 years after

499
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.079
being bullied as an adolescent, there are still greater

500
00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:08.239
risks of mental health issues. Uh And that's by

501
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.699
design, remember that what the bullying is trying to

502
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:14.829
do is send a signal about how dangerous they

503
00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:19.530
are to cross paths with. And so the victim

504
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.150
gets that signal, the victim realizes that if you

505
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.250
meet this person, it it it can end really

506
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.060
badly. And there's a debate in the bullying literature,

507
00:29:32.069 --> 00:29:34.410
if repetition needs to happen, how often does bullying

508
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.770
need to happen for it to happen? I'm of

509
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.579
this school of thought that it, it only needs

510
00:29:38.589 --> 00:29:42.209
to happen once. Um AND uh a colleague at

511
00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:45.060
a recent conference gave an example of a boy

512
00:29:45.069 --> 00:29:49.069
who went to school with a bully. Uh AND

513
00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.550
the first time the bully targeted them, the bully

514
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.449
threw them to the ground and then started stomping

515
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.760
on them and broke their ribs and broke their

516
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.449
shoulders. That was the only incident between them. It

517
00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:02.550
didn't happen again. But you can imagine that's the

518
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.189
only incident you need if you want to send

519
00:30:05.199 --> 00:30:07.530
a message and for the victim, that's the only

520
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.939
incident you need for the rest of your life

521
00:30:09.949 --> 00:30:13.030
to be terrified of a physical confrontation. You had

522
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.750
your, your body broken. If it had been more

523
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.550
severe, it could have punctured your lung and died.

524
00:30:17.979 --> 00:30:24.050
These are really s potentially severe behaviors that uh

525
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.079
again, the bullying is the bully is using as

526
00:30:27.089 --> 00:30:28.900
a signal to the rest of the peer group.

527
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.489
Look what I can do, but the victim is

528
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.489
very clearly see that, look what can happen to

529
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.209
me. And these events can last traumatically for the

530
00:30:40.219 --> 00:30:40.959
entire life.

531
00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:45.180
And the in the that particular case you described

532
00:30:45.189 --> 00:30:48.920
there, I mean, it could have been life threatening

533
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.500
even directly. But there are other extreme cases where

534
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.910
it's life threatening uh, in a different way that

535
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.719
is, it can leave the person, the child, the

536
00:30:59.729 --> 00:31:03.750
adolescent to commit suicide even. Right.

537
00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:07.089
Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm unfortunately aware of other cases

538
00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.030
where the bullying has led to the death of

539
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.160
an individual, uh, directly because of what they've done.

540
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.660
But you're right that also indirectly. Um, AND cyberbullying

541
00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.439
is a case where this has gotten a lot

542
00:31:18.449 --> 00:31:22.189
of attention. You put something online, um, that puts

543
00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:24.359
a child in a position where they feel that

544
00:31:24.369 --> 00:31:27.520
the entire world not necessarily incorrectly, the entire world

545
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.430
can see their weaknesses and their failures. And that

546
00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:35.689
kind of pressure is so intense that unfortunately, it

547
00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:38.239
has resulted in many cases of, of Children killing

548
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.979
themselves. And so this is not of behavior we

549
00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:46.400
can talk about more uh that is genetically determined

550
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.800
and can't be changed. That's a a common theme

551
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.250
in evolutionary theory, but it's also really too important

552
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.099
to recognize it when we say that this is

553
00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:58.489
evolutionarily adaptive or it's natural for kids to engage

554
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.989
in bullying. That doesn't mean it's good. You know,

555
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.969
nature is happy to make a fuzzy cute bunny

556
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.050
and it's happy to make a virus that eats

557
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.689
that fuzzy bunny's brain alive. There, there's no good

558
00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.329
or bad coming from nature. So I really wanna

559
00:32:12.339 --> 00:32:16.290
emphasize that it, it's not saying that this is

560
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.209
a naturalistic behavior that is good for us to

561
00:32:19.219 --> 00:32:23.229
endorse simply because it may have evolutionary advantages. The

562
00:32:23.239 --> 00:32:24.969
cost of victims are extreme.

563
00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:27.949
So I would like to ask you a little

564
00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:31.869
bit more about the psychological traits of bullies. Earlier

565
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.420
I asked you about personality traits. Does bullying relate

566
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:41.229
in any way to psychopathic traits, particularly in men?

567
00:32:42.719 --> 00:32:43.380
Bullying

568
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:47.939
is correlated with low honesty, humility, which is correlated

569
00:32:47.949 --> 00:32:51.239
with the dark triad of behaviors which is narcissism,

570
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:56.140
machiavellian. So, scheming and planning um and psychopathy and

571
00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.260
so it is absolutely related to all three. We

572
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.459
find higher levels of psychopathy in men than in

573
00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:05.579
women. So that relationship is more common in men

574
00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:09.619
than women. I think when we go back to

575
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:14.229
honesty, humility, it really relates to a, a willingness

576
00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:16.829
to exploit others for your own benefit. So if

577
00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:20.130
you think of a dark and selfish gene, uh

578
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.770
and the prisoner's dilemma theory, which is often used

579
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.579
to explain cooper operation. These are people who are

580
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:27.719
willing to exploit others to get what they want.

581
00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.880
And a common theme that we hear from bullies

582
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.719
is that the individual deserved it, right? They had

583
00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:37.939
it coming. Um Because they're stupid, they're ugly, they're,

584
00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:40.900
they're dumb, they, they're not good at interacting with

585
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.239
others. And if you have this kind of arrogance,

586
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.900
which is part of what underlies psychopathy uh saying

587
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.569
that, you know, I'm better than other people. It

588
00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:54.530
goes along with the idea that then people get

589
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.910
what they deserve. And so it makes it easier

590
00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.109
to victimize individuals because you view them as deserving

591
00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:05.800
victimization. And so we absolutely see a strong link

592
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.129
between antisocial personality and bullying behavior.

593
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.239
And is there a link between bullying behavior and

594
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.239
other sorts of psychopathology?

595
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.330
That was one of the things that we, as

596
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.438
I mentioned at the start, we really early on

597
00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.870
interest and we thought we'd see the idea that

598
00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.699
these bullies are, you know, low in self esteem,

599
00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:32.750
they have bad social skills, poor theory of mind,

600
00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.909
which means understanding how other people think and they

601
00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:39.750
don't. Um THAT'S true of bully victims. And why

602
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.149
we think that that stereotype is persisted is because

603
00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.989
bully victims are the kids who are both bullies

604
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.280
and victims and they come from bad households, they

605
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.590
have poor social skills and they're likely the ones

606
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.679
who are being caught, the head of the football

607
00:34:53.688 --> 00:34:58.939
team, uh the cheerleader, uh who's queen of the

608
00:34:58.949 --> 00:35:02.729
cheerleaders, uh the, the, the straight A student, these

609
00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:05.219
are people who know how to avoid being caught.

610
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.969
And so they don't get viewed by adults as

611
00:35:08.979 --> 00:35:12.969
being bullies more often, but they're engaging in this

612
00:35:12.979 --> 00:35:15.739
behavior much more than the bully victims. And the

613
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.300
damage that they do is much more severe because

614
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.100
they have these good social skills. So the really

615
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.219
negative outcomes being associated with bullying are number one,

616
00:35:26.229 --> 00:35:28.770
you're more likely to be involved with antisocial behavior

617
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.489
later on. I think that's partly because they have

618
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.350
these antisocial traits to begin with, say low honesty,

619
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.929
humility or psychopathy as you mentioned. And then people

620
00:35:37.939 --> 00:35:41.550
are less likely to like you. So there's a

621
00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.379
big difference between uh likability and popularity and you

622
00:35:46.389 --> 00:35:48.820
can see this distinction in all kinds of literature.

623
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.300
It's an evolutionary psychology, it's dominance and prestige in

624
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.659
politics. They talk about hard versus soft power. The

625
00:35:55.669 --> 00:35:58.219
idea is that you can influence people by coercing

626
00:35:58.229 --> 00:36:01.810
them or by having them want to be with

627
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.620
you. So, being motivated to cooper with you and

628
00:36:06.629 --> 00:36:12.530
consistently bullies are rated as being less light. And

629
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.110
I'll go back to my example of Donald Trump.

630
00:36:15.489 --> 00:36:17.770
Uh Even many of his supporters will say they

631
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.159
don't like the way he behaves, they don't like

632
00:36:20.169 --> 00:36:21.939
what he does and the way he treats people,

633
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.229
but they respect that he's effective, they respect that

634
00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:27.020
he can get the job done. And if he's

635
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.100
on their side, he's getting them resources that they

636
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.050
need. And so that's the, the trade off that

637
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.070
bullies are having that people respect that they're dominant

638
00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.179
and powerful and can get their way, but they

639
00:36:38.189 --> 00:36:41.699
don't particularly like or trust them because they have

640
00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:44.629
shown that when push comes to shove, to shove,

641
00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:46.370
they're willing to hurt other people to get what

642
00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:51.280
they want. And people are rightly um concerned with

643
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:54.739
the fact that if you're willing to do this

644
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.330
to XYZ, they're willing to do it to you

645
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.090
if you get in their way. So when we

646
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.030
talk about the, the cost of bullying, that's one

647
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.020
of the major costs is that while people respect

648
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.840
the power the bullies have and acknowledge the power

649
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.219
the bullies have. They don't like them. And that's

650
00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:16.419
potentially a really serious issue. If the bully ever

651
00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:19.969
loses their power, then they don't have allies who

652
00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:21.870
want to stay with them or help support them.

653
00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.729
So, I it's a precarious position for Belize to

654
00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:25.110
be in

655
00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:29.500
a and so particularly when it comes to, of

656
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:34.870
course, childhood and adolescent bullying, lots of it happen

657
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.820
uh at school. So are there any social factors

658
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.790
related to the way schools are structured that might

659
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.149
contribute to bullying behavior?

660
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.350
Absolutely. You know, the same thing when I mentioned

661
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.129
the the chocolate chip cookie, you need to have

662
00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:54.780
the oven for it to develop a polar bear's

663
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.889
fur makes no sense in the Sahara Desert. So

664
00:37:58.899 --> 00:38:01.620
you have to understand the environment if you want

665
00:38:01.629 --> 00:38:05.570
to understand evolutionary adaptations and we know that more

666
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.350
competitive environments uh are more likely to cause bullying.

667
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.409
We know that um an absence of supervision is

668
00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:17.530
more likely to cause bullying, but only for individuals

669
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:23.469
who have low uh honesty, humility or antisocial personality

670
00:38:23.479 --> 00:38:26.629
traits. So for individuals who are not predisposed to

671
00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.370
take advantage of others, it doesn't matter if adults

672
00:38:29.379 --> 00:38:32.919
are paying attention, but for individuals who are predisposed

673
00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:34.520
to maybe take advantage of others for their own

674
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.370
benefit, then it really matters if adults are focusing

675
00:38:37.379 --> 00:38:41.229
in on uh that behavior or not. And interestingly

676
00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:45.989
data has recently corroborated that for the outcomes of

677
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.550
victims. It's actually worse when there are fewer victims

678
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.010
in a classroom. So if you're victimized and there's

679
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.820
10 other people in the class who are victimized.

680
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.260
Out of 30 your mental health outcomes are better

681
00:38:58.429 --> 00:39:00.620
than if you're the only one in the entire

682
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.439
class. And that deals with this idea of being

683
00:39:03.449 --> 00:39:07.060
isolated uh and being selected as somebody who's not

684
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.560
part of the group. So both for bullies and

685
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.280
for victims, the social environment has a major impact

686
00:39:13.669 --> 00:39:17.239
and we see this across cultures that every culture

687
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.709
we've looked at shows bullying, but its prevalence rates

688
00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:23.639
are so that slightly different, the ratio of bullies

689
00:39:23.649 --> 00:39:26.770
to victims are slightly different and the most common

690
00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:30.870
or frequencies of different kinds of bullying. So physical

691
00:39:30.879 --> 00:39:35.139
versus relational are different across cultures. And that's really

692
00:39:35.149 --> 00:39:39.479
important to understand because it suggests that bullying is

693
00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:42.929
a faculty of adaptation. What we mean by that

694
00:39:42.939 --> 00:39:47.179
is its likelihood of happening. It's likelihood of being

695
00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:51.800
expressed depends on the environmental conditions. So a a

696
00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.479
great quote that I have from uh some adolescents

697
00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.040
is they, we were asking them why they would

698
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.489
be involved with defending somebody else. And one of

699
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.850
them said I didn't get involved because that person

700
00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.189
was really big. But if my friends were around

701
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.520
with me, then I would have stepped in. And

702
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.439
so they recognize the power disadvantage that they're not

703
00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:18.239
capable of stopping this powerful bully at the time.

704
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.669
But if the environmental circumstances were different and they

705
00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:22.600
had four or five friends behind them, then they

706
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.540
might have stepped in and stopped it. So, bullying

707
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:30.879
really depends a lot on the environmental contingency uh

708
00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:34.139
that operates around it. I don't know if I,

709
00:40:34.149 --> 00:40:37.550
if I can go a little further, somebody who

710
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.350
I've labeled somebody else who I've labeled as a

711
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.350
bully, uh as an adult is Vladimir Putin, uh

712
00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:47.669
who tried attacking Ukraine a weaker country and you

713
00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:51.110
can clearly see that Ukraine needs help from other

714
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.580
bystanders from Europe and North America to support it.

715
00:40:54.959 --> 00:40:57.310
And if they don't have that, that's going to

716
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.929
encourage the bully to keep going on. And as

717
00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:04.120
of this recording, uh there's debate in the US

718
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:07.600
Senate about providing aid to Ukraine and Putin just

719
00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.030
released a statement saying that he's not backing down

720
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.169
until he gets what he wants, which is directly

721
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:15.320
related to the fact that he's seeing a lack

722
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.080
of support in the environment or potentially a lack

723
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.899
of support in the environment. And so the environmental

724
00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:27.360
conditions are really important for adjusting the costs and

725
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.310
benefits of bullying and therefore the likelihood that somebody

726
00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.399
will engage in bullying.

727
00:41:32.669 --> 00:41:35.120
So one of the things that you mentioned there

728
00:41:35.129 --> 00:41:37.979
that I want to ask you more about is

729
00:41:37.989 --> 00:41:41.409
uh at the beginning, you mentioned that a competitive

730
00:41:41.419 --> 00:41:45.729
environments promote bullying behavior. So in the case of

731
00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:50.169
schools, is that related in any way, also to

732
00:41:50.179 --> 00:41:54.340
the fact that there's academic performance there to be

733
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.830
measured academic achievements and all of that or not,

734
00:41:59.719 --> 00:42:03.939
any time you have a non zero sum competition,

735
00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:06.800
you're likely to see less bullying by non zero

736
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.979
sum means everybody can benefit when only one person

737
00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:12.780
can benefit, then you're likely to see an increase

738
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.699
in bullying. And the reason is it becomes more

739
00:42:15.709 --> 00:42:19.739
adaptive to bully. So if there's um an academic

740
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:25.750
prize for Greatest Interview, um and you, you and

741
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.659
I are competing for that, then there's more motive

742
00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:32.500
for us to try and win that prize. If

743
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.729
there's only one, whereas that prize is given to

744
00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:38.479
anybody who does a good interview, then we can

745
00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.909
focus on our own achievements without trying to attack

746
00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:44.360
the other individual. So absolutely, when we find higher

747
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.699
levels of income inequality, we've looked at this uh

748
00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:50.129
at global levels, higher levels of income inequality are

749
00:42:50.139 --> 00:42:54.520
associated with higher levels of bullying. And the idea

750
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:59.090
there is it's more adaptive to compete when there

751
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.280
are big and rare prizes for winning. The, the

752
00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.439
more that we make prizes egalitarian, the less incentive

753
00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:11.290
there is to compete for those prizes and competing

754
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:15.050
again um is often done by individuals who have

755
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:20.100
this predisposition to want to try and uh be

756
00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.020
number one and win those competitions.

757
00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:29.040
And when and why do people intervene in bullying

758
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.540
incidents? There is they see someone being a victim

759
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.020
of a particular bullying incident when and why do

760
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.080
they decide to intervene?

761
00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:43.909
So there's two primary reasons that tend to predict

762
00:43:43.919 --> 00:43:49.229
uh what we call defenders, bullying. Uh IN bullying

763
00:43:49.239 --> 00:43:51.199
instance, when somebody steps in to try and protect

764
00:43:51.209 --> 00:43:54.179
the victim. Uh The first is a sense of

765
00:43:54.189 --> 00:43:57.449
moral empathy. So not necessarily emotional empathy, I feel

766
00:43:57.459 --> 00:44:00.310
what they feel, but a, a sense of justice

767
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.070
and what's right. And that's high honesty, humility. But

768
00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.469
it's also interestingly associated with higher levels of power.

769
00:44:07.889 --> 00:44:11.080
And that makes sense when you again consider that

770
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.060
bullying is based on a power of disadvantage. So

771
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.379
weaker individuals rarely intervene because their intervention is ineffective.

772
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.469
Um I if the most popular kids in the

773
00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:25.429
class are picking on somebody and you're number 20

774
00:44:25.439 --> 00:44:27.669
out of 30 you're not likely to change the

775
00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:31.110
behavior of number 12 and three. BASED on your

776
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.959
popularity and your strength. On the other hand, if

777
00:44:34.969 --> 00:44:37.639
number three is bullying and you're number one in

778
00:44:37.649 --> 00:44:40.500
the class in terms of popularity and and social

779
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.629
status, then you can effectively apply your power to

780
00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:47.399
end that. So interestingly, and it's something that we're

781
00:44:47.409 --> 00:44:51.939
very interested in following. Um INDIVIDUALS can use their

782
00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:56.199
social power in a prosocial way by intervening and

783
00:44:56.209 --> 00:45:00.699
stopping the bully and individuals who do that gain

784
00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:04.729
popularity, they also gain liability. So they get the

785
00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:07.590
most of the best of both worlds and that

786
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.169
people say that yes, this person has effective power

787
00:45:10.179 --> 00:45:13.139
like bullies do, but they like them because they

788
00:45:13.149 --> 00:45:15.129
use it in a way that helps other people.

789
00:45:15.639 --> 00:45:19.080
That is the best way that we have found

790
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.129
to being popular and light, you know, kind of

791
00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:25.419
the two benefits of people recognize that you have

792
00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:28.050
power, but they like being around you because you

793
00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:32.399
don't abuse it. So that's a particularly interesting direction

794
00:45:32.409 --> 00:45:37.810
that we wanna really explore and um look at

795
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.540
for interventions which I'm sure we'll chat about. Um

796
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.620
But I can maybe mention here is a good

797
00:45:42.629 --> 00:45:48.379
point that interventions that rely on peers to step

798
00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:51.860
in have been shown to be effective. Uh Kiva

799
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.729
is the, the model that's been done out of

800
00:45:53.739 --> 00:45:57.000
Finland with Christina Salma Ali, it's been tested around

801
00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.620
the world reduces bullying by about 20 25% which

802
00:46:00.629 --> 00:46:03.469
is uh for better or for worse, but the

803
00:46:03.479 --> 00:46:06.550
best that we have, but it doesn't work for

804
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.229
high popularity bullies who unfortunately most of the bullies

805
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.530
so peers can intervene and stop low and medium

806
00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.699
status bullies from bullying. And so the popular kids

807
00:46:17.709 --> 00:46:19.719
can say, hey, knock it off. But when it's

808
00:46:19.729 --> 00:46:22.689
the popular kids who are doing the bullying, peers

809
00:46:22.699 --> 00:46:25.500
don't have much of an impact because it they're

810
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.280
not at the top of the power scheme. So

811
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:32.600
it's really important to consider the implications of power

812
00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.729
and the willingness of people to step in and

813
00:46:36.739 --> 00:46:40.520
the effectiveness of people to step in. Uh You

814
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.919
know, as I said, I've written a couple of

815
00:46:42.929 --> 00:46:47.449
articles uh in Canadian newspapers about Vladimir Putin being

816
00:46:47.459 --> 00:46:50.439
a bully. I unfortunately do not have the power

817
00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:53.649
to stop Vladimir Putin's behavior. I know as, as

818
00:46:53.659 --> 00:46:56.800
a single academic, my power effect on him is

819
00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.300
negligible. Right. And that's, that would be the same

820
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.229
thing in a classroom if the popular kids are

821
00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:04.750
bullying and somebody wants to try and defend them

822
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.570
without power, your likelihood of being able to stop

823
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.709
it is very low. Doesn't mean that we shouldn't

824
00:47:09.719 --> 00:47:12.560
try. Um, BUT it does mean that the effectiveness

825
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:13.929
is, is greatly diminished.

826
00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.340
Mhm. Uh So I have here one more topic

827
00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:19.909
that I would like to ask you about and

828
00:47:19.919 --> 00:47:22.090
then a couple of questions from a patron of

829
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.159
the show, but just before we get into the

830
00:47:24.169 --> 00:47:27.580
final topic, uh still about on the topic of

831
00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:32.040
bullying. Uh AND when it comes to intervention specifically,

832
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:37.120
so because of the very nefarious individual and societal

833
00:47:37.129 --> 00:47:40.620
effects that bullying has as we talked about here

834
00:47:40.629 --> 00:47:44.040
today, uh I mean, from a and since you

835
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:49.070
come from an evolutionary and developmental perspective, do we

836
00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.439
know of any good interventions to reduce bullying uh

837
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:55.560
effectively?

838
00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.879
You know, that that's the really big question. Um

839
00:48:01.139 --> 00:48:02.909
And we have learned a lot in 20 years

840
00:48:02.919 --> 00:48:06.870
about what works and what doesn't work. Um So

841
00:48:06.879 --> 00:48:09.770
some of the things that don't work are asking

842
00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.989
the victims to fight back. Um BECAUSE as I

843
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.500
said earlier, that uh often backfires and makes the

844
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.040
problem worse. Having the bully and the victim sit

845
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.310
down together and try and mediate, it makes the

846
00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.229
problem worse. The bully says you ratted on me

847
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.510
and we see the bullying goes down but then

848
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.340
it goes back worse than it was before and

849
00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.209
zero tolerance policies where schools say if you do

850
00:48:33.219 --> 00:48:36.010
this, we're gonna suspend you and that doesn't work

851
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.709
because bullies are smart and don't get caught. So

852
00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:43.780
that's not very effective. What does work? I've mentioned

853
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.449
the Kiva program that is effective in stopping a

854
00:48:46.459 --> 00:48:50.080
low and medium popularity bullies, uh not effective with

855
00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:54.070
higher popularity bullies. A really interesting study was done

856
00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.949
in Norway where uh Dan Elvas was kind of

857
00:48:57.959 --> 00:49:01.040
the the the godfather of bullying research. And he

858
00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.169
was able to implement a program where the federal

859
00:49:03.179 --> 00:49:07.280
government, their version of provincial and municipal and schools

860
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:10.090
and parents all cracked down on bullying and they

861
00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.209
reduced bullying by almost 40% which is the biggest

862
00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:16.979
reduction we've seen. But of course, it was very

863
00:49:16.989 --> 00:49:19.810
intensive to try and maintain this focus on bullying.

864
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.850
And what was really instructive was after three years

865
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.729
as governments do. They said, ok, well, that problem's

866
00:49:25.739 --> 00:49:29.030
solved, let's stop investing in it. And bullying immediately

867
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.080
shot back up to pre intervention levels, which is

868
00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:34.899
really important from an evolutionary perspective because it tells

869
00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:37.419
us that bullying is not simply a learned or

870
00:49:37.429 --> 00:49:40.610
copycat behavior. If it was students would have copied

871
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.649
that low level and kept it at low levels.

872
00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:45.060
The fact that it popped back up tells us

873
00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.360
that it's sensitive to costs and benefits when adults

874
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:53.090
really tried to make it uh costly, that bullies

875
00:49:53.229 --> 00:49:56.409
avoided doing it. What we focused on in our

876
00:49:56.419 --> 00:50:00.370
group is a program called meaningful roles where we

877
00:50:00.379 --> 00:50:03.060
try and teach bullies to get the goals that

878
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.270
they want without hurting others. Right? So I'm not

879
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.870
often invited to schools anymore. I was invited frequently

880
00:50:10.879 --> 00:50:13.229
early in my career. But when I go to

881
00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:16.939
schools and say bullying will get you sex, popularity

882
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.360
and resources and we can't catch you. That's not

883
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.870
a good message for adolescence, right? Because of course,

884
00:50:23.879 --> 00:50:27.540
those are things that adolescents want. Uh And many

885
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:31.149
people beyond adolescence want. So instead, we're taking the

886
00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:35.870
message of, we recognize that sex and popularity and

887
00:50:35.879 --> 00:50:38.760
resources are important to you. But there's better ways

888
00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.659
of getting them, there's ways of getting them in

889
00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:44.929
particular that will make you popular and light. So

890
00:50:44.939 --> 00:50:47.919
if you wanna be popular in the classroom, uh

891
00:50:47.929 --> 00:50:50.159
we can give you the role of whenever somebody

892
00:50:50.169 --> 00:50:54.310
comes in the classroom, you say hello, David, welcome

893
00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.209
to uh Mrs Smith's grade seven classroom. And so

894
00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:03.010
every person who walks in that classroom recognizes that

895
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.719
person who used to be a bully and they're

896
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.080
getting the popularity that they wanted, they're getting the

897
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.040
attention that they want, but they're doing it in

898
00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:13.300
a nice way. And so number one, it takes

899
00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.459
away from their time and ability to bully others

900
00:51:15.469 --> 00:51:18.399
because they're doing something else. And number two, it's

901
00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:20.250
showing them that they can get what they want

902
00:51:20.379 --> 00:51:23.689
without having to be antisocial towards other people. And

903
00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:26.500
I think that's a really critical factor that we

904
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.659
have to acknowledge because otherwise it, it's a really

905
00:51:29.669 --> 00:51:33.159
hard sell to say to adolescents. Stop doing this.

906
00:51:33.169 --> 00:51:35.969
We can't catch you doing this and it's getting

907
00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:39.189
you more sex and popularity. That's, that's, those are

908
00:51:39.199 --> 00:51:43.500
very powerful incentives for individuals to behave in that

909
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.870
way. So we need to find better ways of

910
00:51:46.879 --> 00:51:50.169
showing how people can get those goals without being

911
00:51:50.179 --> 00:51:51.709
antisocial towards other people.

912
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:57.399
Mhm. So changing topics, then I would like to

913
00:51:57.409 --> 00:52:01.280
ask you about something that is perhaps, I don't

914
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.479
know to what extent exactly, but perhaps somewhat related

915
00:52:04.489 --> 00:52:09.500
to bullying. But what is classroom in civility and

916
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:14.219
how is it conceptualized by both students and teachers

917
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:20.060
classroom incivility was something that uh my former colleague

918
00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:22.419
Zito Marini, who passed away a few years ago

919
00:52:22.429 --> 00:52:26.840
was interested in and it's basically following the rules

920
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:32.709
that we have for governing civil behavior or appropriate

921
00:52:32.719 --> 00:52:37.260
social behavior. So, uh standing in line quietly, not

922
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:40.320
talking when the teacher is talking, uh not packing

923
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:42.580
up your books early, not making rude jokes to

924
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.870
other people in the class. And these kinds of

925
00:52:45.879 --> 00:52:49.270
behaviors were often viewed as fairly trivial. Um AND

926
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.340
not worth worrying about compared to some of the

927
00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.629
more severe behaviors that we've seen in the classroom.

928
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.760
But what we've seen is that the same personality

929
00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:02.750
traits that predict more antisocial behavior, predict uncivil behavior

930
00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.580
and that these incivil behaviors over time predict your

931
00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:12.479
behavior in more severe situations. So kids who are

932
00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:14.639
likely to pack up their books early, who are

933
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:16.979
likely to talk when the teacher is talking are

934
00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:20.909
also more likely over time to bully other kids

935
00:53:20.919 --> 00:53:26.469
and, and cause uh more severe antisocial problems. So,

936
00:53:27.399 --> 00:53:32.030
what we think is happening is that civility is

937
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.219
again a form of costly signaling. So why do

938
00:53:36.229 --> 00:53:38.820
we say the word, please? You know, if you're

939
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:43.189
having some nice tapas tonight, uh and I want

940
00:53:43.199 --> 00:53:45.120
some of that octopus. Why do I have to

941
00:53:45.129 --> 00:53:48.129
say? Can you please pass me that? Not just

942
00:53:48.139 --> 00:53:51.840
pass me that it's because adding the word please

943
00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:56.250
is showing you that I'm willing to make effort

944
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.860
to be civil and cooper when you don't have

945
00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.590
that. If I just said pass me the octopus,

946
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.899
then I am showing that I don't care about

947
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.169
investing in that relationship. I don't care about investing

948
00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:14.159
in that cost and that seems to be a

949
00:54:14.169 --> 00:54:18.199
low level but important route of antisocial behavior.

950
00:54:19.419 --> 00:54:24.139
Mhm And so uh I have then two questions

951
00:54:24.149 --> 00:54:26.340
from a patron of the show, as I mentioned

952
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.669
earlier, Bernardo Sei. And they are basically about some

953
00:54:30.679 --> 00:54:33.590
of the work you've been doing on life history

954
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.800
theory and life history strategies and topics of the

955
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.939
sort. So, uh the first one has to do

956
00:54:39.949 --> 00:54:44.459
directly with one of your papers titled Historical and

957
00:54:44.469 --> 00:54:48.159
The Hunter Gatherer Perspectives on Fast, slow life history

958
00:54:48.169 --> 00:54:52.169
strategies. And the question is uh could you discuss

959
00:54:52.179 --> 00:54:55.659
if the predictions made by life history theory about

960
00:54:55.669 --> 00:55:00.620
environmental effects are supported by the historical evidence we

961
00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:01.939
have or not?

962
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:07.760
So it depends what aspect of life history theory.

963
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.629
Life history theory evolve in biology. No pun intended

964
00:55:12.639 --> 00:55:16.429
um as a way of explaining how organisms allocate

965
00:55:16.439 --> 00:55:19.429
their time and energy across their lifespan. So, did

966
00:55:19.439 --> 00:55:22.379
they spend it more in chasing mates and raising

967
00:55:22.389 --> 00:55:27.159
their offspring and growing a big body? Um And

968
00:55:27.169 --> 00:55:31.469
so that it is a very viable and active

969
00:55:31.479 --> 00:55:35.310
part in the biological literature, what came into the

970
00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:39.780
human literature um were theories that said in harsh

971
00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:45.979
environments, individuals should speed up their reproduction so that

972
00:55:45.989 --> 00:55:51.600
they could reproduce before they died. The reality um

973
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.229
is that when we look at those effects, they're

974
00:55:55.239 --> 00:56:01.189
small across cultures. Um And I'm involved in reviewing

975
00:56:01.199 --> 00:56:03.290
a, a rebuttal to what I said, I'm trying

976
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.899
to pick my words carefully here. Uh But the

977
00:56:06.909 --> 00:56:09.929
basic idea is that there's a very small effect

978
00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:14.889
that being in antisocial or stressful environments is more

979
00:56:14.899 --> 00:56:18.290
likely to cause early puberty and having more Children.

980
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.719
The first problem with that is it doesn't consider

981
00:56:22.729 --> 00:56:26.129
the reverse effects in that we know that individuals

982
00:56:26.139 --> 00:56:28.389
who have early puberty and have kids when they're

983
00:56:28.399 --> 00:56:31.629
teenagers, in modern societies are much more likely to

984
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:35.070
then have bad environment. So, if you were a

985
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.229
15 year old girl in Spain and you're pregnant,

986
00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:40.679
you're likely to drop out of high school, you're

987
00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:42.739
less likely to go to university, you're less likely

988
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.010
to have a stable marriage, you're less likely to

989
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.820
have financial stability, you're more likely to be involved

990
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.870
with substance abuse. And these are big effects. So

991
00:56:50.879 --> 00:56:54.620
we see right away that the opposite explanation has

992
00:56:54.629 --> 00:56:58.330
a much stronger uh effect size to it, that

993
00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.590
it's not that bad environments are causing people to

994
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.600
mature more quickly. But being an early mature and

995
00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:09.040
in particular, having Children early is a significant risk

996
00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:15.080
factor um for their development in modern societies. Historically,

997
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:18.489
when we look at the data, the data is

998
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:23.500
unequivocal that historically, in the past, individuals who had

999
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:28.239
more resources were able to have puberty sooner because

1000
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.429
they had the physical resources, they were able to

1001
00:57:30.439 --> 00:57:33.810
have shorter inter birth intervals because they either could

1002
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:36.820
restore their nutrition faster as women or have uh

1003
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:40.709
wet nurses and or as men, they could have

1004
00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:45.010
more wives or uh concubines or, you know, out

1005
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:48.800
of marriage partners that they could reproduce with. And

1006
00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:52.929
the genetic evidence shows this as well that repeatedly

1007
00:57:52.939 --> 00:57:55.800
in human history, a small group of men have

1008
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:59.310
dominated the gene pool. So 1% of all people

1009
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.389
alive today are descended from Genghis Khan, uh the

1010
00:58:03.399 --> 00:58:09.159
founders of the original first Chinese civilization. Um A

1011
00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:12.250
group of men from that time who we believe

1012
00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.270
are likely to be the rulers of that time

1013
00:58:14.409 --> 00:58:17.830
are related to 20% of Chinese men alive today.

1014
00:58:18.419 --> 00:58:20.860
Uh You find the same correlations in Ireland, in

1015
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:25.389
the Middle East where small groups of individuals have

1016
00:58:25.399 --> 00:58:29.239
exploited their resources and didn't have a slow strategy.

1017
00:58:29.679 --> 00:58:32.270
And that's the thing. They didn't delay the reproduction.

1018
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.909
They didn't have fewer Children that they invest in.

1019
00:58:35.379 --> 00:58:40.120
Instead they invested heavily in reproduction. So why do

1020
00:58:40.129 --> 00:58:43.000
we see what we see today? Uh I think

1021
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:46.800
partly because of what I've said, um that's that

1022
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:49.149
we're looking at it the wrong way. It's not

1023
00:58:49.159 --> 00:58:53.280
the environment causing the early reproduction. It's the early

1024
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.830
reproduction leading to the environment. And secondly, we are

1025
00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.879
in a demographically, very unusual time for human beings.

1026
00:59:01.449 --> 00:59:05.540
And one of the major, if not the biggest

1027
00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:09.409
question, evolutionary psychology is, why don't we repro reproduce

1028
00:59:09.419 --> 00:59:15.530
more often? So as a uh faculty in uh

1029
00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.729
uh in Canada, my salary is public. So I

1030
00:59:19.739 --> 00:59:22.300
make about 100 and $75,000 a year as a

1031
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.770
full professor. Now, why don't I have 15 kids?

1032
00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.870
I have three, which is more than a lot

1033
00:59:27.879 --> 00:59:30.310
of professors. Why not? 15? Why not 20? I

1034
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.050
can theoretically support them. And we're in a very

1035
00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:36.689
strange place demographically. Um And this is where I

1036
00:59:36.699 --> 00:59:39.239
think some of the confusion comes from, is looking

1037
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:41.959
at modern humans and how we behave versus what

1038
00:59:41.969 --> 00:59:46.010
was available in the past. So uh put differently

1039
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.610
if somebody was in a harsh environment in the

1040
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.120
past and they wanted to speed up the reproduction

1041
00:59:51.649 --> 00:59:54.709
where did they get the resources from? You can

1042
00:59:54.719 --> 00:59:58.340
have uh 10 kids in Spain or in Canada

1043
00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.520
where we have social networks where the government will

1044
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.479
provide you free education to an extent for food

1045
01:00:04.489 --> 01:00:09.280
and housing and medical care that didn't exist 1000

1046
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:12.250
years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, if

1047
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.090
you're a hunter gatherer and you have 10 Children

1048
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.610
and you can't provide for them, they die. It's

1049
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.780
a really maladapted outcome. So that's why I think

1050
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:23.500
it's really important for life history theory. But for

1051
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:27.770
behavior and evolutionary theory in general to look beyond

1052
01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:32.260
modern examples. So uh as much as we're pleased

1053
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.629
that we found data showing that uh it's currently

1054
01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:37.750
adaptive to be a bully and that you have

1055
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.050
more offspring. That's not the same thing as saying

1056
01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.270
that it was adaptive in the past. We do

1057
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.379
have lots of other evidence that it was adaptive

1058
01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.169
in the past. But we have to be very

1059
01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:51.030
careful about using modern data to draw conclusions about

1060
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.419
how we used to live ancestrally

1061
01:00:55.159 --> 01:00:58.620
and so related to that. The also the second

1062
01:00:58.629 --> 01:01:02.449
question, how do we know if life history strategies

1063
01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:07.439
are the product of nature or nurture? Most studies

1064
01:01:07.449 --> 01:01:09.820
on the subject are correlation

1065
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.860
really good questions from your patron. Um One of

1066
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:20.110
the things that you would expect if you saw

1067
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.389
say, for example, uh the argument being that harsh

1068
01:01:25.399 --> 01:01:28.169
environments cause you to speed up puberty. And I've

1069
01:01:28.179 --> 01:01:31.020
argued the opposite. And Sarah Hury in her book,

1070
01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:33.379
um, was the first one to do that. I

1071
01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:38.179
think it was, uh, Mother Nature mentioned this possibility

1072
01:01:38.189 --> 01:01:42.620
that it was this reverse effect. And you would

1073
01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:44.860
expect that if you were, had a teenage mother,

1074
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.250
uh, who gave birth to you, who didn't go

1075
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.409
to high school, who didn't have a stable relationship

1076
01:01:52.419 --> 01:01:55.969
because not surprisingly, teenage relationships are not as strong

1077
01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:59.239
as getting married in your late twenties or thirties,

1078
01:01:59.719 --> 01:02:02.790
um who doesn't have a lot of income. So

1079
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.989
it looks like this person's harsh environment is associated

1080
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.530
with their uh earlier reproduction. But not only is

1081
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.639
that being influenced by the environment that they're raised

1082
01:02:14.649 --> 01:02:18.219
in, they're watching their mother's behavior. So father absence

1083
01:02:18.229 --> 01:02:21.199
is commonly something that is associated with the faster

1084
01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:24.709
life history. But if they're observing their way that

1085
01:02:24.719 --> 01:02:27.729
their mother behaves, we know from a huge range

1086
01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:33.040
of uh studies that Children imitate their parents. Uh

1087
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:37.129
It, it's an evolutionarily adaptive strategy. It underlies the

1088
01:02:37.139 --> 01:02:42.000
earliest evolutionary psychology which is Bowie's attachment that you

1089
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:44.409
should copy what your parents did because they managed

1090
01:02:44.419 --> 01:02:47.239
to survive and reproduce and make you. So they're,

1091
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.649
they're at least a good enough model to copy

1092
01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:54.050
from the environment. So if an individual is being

1093
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.280
born uh in an environment to a teenage mother

1094
01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.550
who doesn't go to high school, who has unstable

1095
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.959
relationships, it's not shocking that that person is then

1096
01:03:01.969 --> 01:03:05.830
more likely to grow up in uh an environment

1097
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.500
and become less likely to go to high school

1098
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:12.370
and graduate high school and have stable partners because

1099
01:03:12.379 --> 01:03:14.979
they're learning from the environment. So I would completely

1100
01:03:14.989 --> 01:03:16.510
agree with the idea that we need to be

1101
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:22.290
very cautious about these correlational um behaviors and make

1102
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.189
sure that we're looking at them from all the

1103
01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:28.300
different perspectives that could cause causation, which is a

1104
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:32.879
bad way of saying when we have correlations, you

1105
01:03:32.889 --> 01:03:35.090
wanna make sure that it's not just going in

1106
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.790
one direction that other directions have been looked at

1107
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.030
and have been found less plausible. And in the

1108
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.850
case of life history theory, the effect sizes are

1109
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.080
much larger in the direction going from having a

1110
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.370
mother. And we know that genetics are really strongly

1111
01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:53.629
involved with early reproduction and timing of anarchy that

1112
01:03:53.639 --> 01:03:56.209
having mother in that situation is a really big

1113
01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:58.550
effect size for you having risks later on in

1114
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.729
your development, going the other direction. It's a really

1115
01:04:01.739 --> 01:04:05.600
small effect size that being in that environment predicting

1116
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:09.620
you having early reproduction is a very small factor

1117
01:04:09.629 --> 01:04:14.219
and probably the result of that larger correlation. So

1118
01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:17.360
more research needs to be done in the directions

1119
01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.699
of these effects and then especially we need to

1120
01:04:20.709 --> 01:04:22.899
look and make sure that they make sense historically

1121
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:26.489
because as I said earlier, uh you know, it

1122
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.030
reminds me of a 19 eighties commercial for burgers

1123
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.949
where they were saying, where is the beef? It

1124
01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.830
was, you know, looking at a mcdonald's hamburger and

1125
01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.409
saying it's so small. That's the reality. How does

1126
01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:40.479
this happen in the in ancestral environment? How do

1127
01:04:40.489 --> 01:04:43.120
you speed up your reproduction if you're in a

1128
01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:48.239
one acre farm, uh or one square kilometer farm

1129
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.840
and you already have two or three people living

1130
01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:51.870
there? How do you get more food? There's, there's

1131
01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:54.919
not social systems like we have today that will

1132
01:04:54.929 --> 01:04:56.939
provide for your offspring. So we need to look

1133
01:04:56.949 --> 01:05:00.590
at the viability of these theories um in the

1134
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.260
environments that they would have evolved in.

1135
01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.600
Great. So, Doctor Volt, just before we go, would

1136
01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.679
you like to tell people where they can find

1137
01:05:08.689 --> 01:05:10.560
you and your work on the internet?

1138
01:05:12.649 --> 01:05:16.030
Uh I maintain a relatively low profile. Um But

1139
01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.479
if you Google my name, uh you'll, you'll see

1140
01:05:18.489 --> 01:05:21.429
my labs. Uh There's Brock U dot C A

1141
01:05:21.439 --> 01:05:26.030

1142
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.550
well as uh Brock U dot C A slash

1143
01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.060
brave, which is um a group of us who

1144
01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:37.290
are studying bullying from an evolutionary perspective and trying

1145
01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.080
to intervene. Um So I always welcome any thoughts

1146
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:43.510
or questions or ideas that folks have. Um But

1147
01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.520
generally I try to stay off of arguments uh

1148
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:51.679
on social media because it's not my forte for

1149
01:05:51.689 --> 01:05:55.129
engaging in those, but I welcome any thoughts, ideas

1150
01:05:55.139 --> 01:05:56.620
or questions that folks may have.

1151
01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.169
