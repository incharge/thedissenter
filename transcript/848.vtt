00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.048 --> 00:00:05.440
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.429
And today I'm joined for a third time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.909
Robert Sapolsky. And today we're talking about his latest

5
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.899
book, Determined The Science of Life without free will

6
00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:19.850
. And I'm also leaving the links to our first

7
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.589
two interviews in the description of this one. So

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.899
Doctor Sapolsky, welcome back to the show. It's

9
00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:29.519
always a pleasure to everyone. Well, likewise seeing

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.529
you again and uh glad we're on the other side

11
00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.529
of the pandemic. A pleasure to be here.

12
00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.840
OK. So in our first two interviews, we

13
00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:43.959
talked a lot about the science of human behavior and

14
00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.819
this time focusing on questions surrounding free will and determinism

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.798
. Are there specific aspects of the science of human

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.728
behavior that you would deem to be the most important

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.279
here when considering these types of questions? Well,

18
00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.049
um just as a preamble, my, my song

19
00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:11.269
and dance is that there's no free will. We

20
00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:17.430
have none whatsoever. Um which puts me fairly far

21
00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.948
on the extreme of the continuum of people thinking about

22
00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.079
this. Um but that we have no free will

23
00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:27.439
at all. And this is relevant to everything about

24
00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.989
how we became, who became uh individually, all

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
of that, why you just did what you did

26
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.638
. Um But in terms of where that's most important

27
00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.079
, um just to focus on the very narrow area

28
00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:47.430
, which is anything but narrow. Um The biggest

29
00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.180
implication of that is none of us are entitled to

30
00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.010
anything. None of us have earned to be treated

31
00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:00.319
any differently than anyone else. Of course, we

32
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.620
may need to be treated differently. Uh Like if

33
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:07.819
you're uncontrollably violent, people have to be protected from

34
00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.919
you. Um If you have extremely good motor skills

35
00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.258
through no, you know, achievement of your own

36
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.770
, uh Maybe you're a candidate to be a good

37
00:02:16.778 --> 00:02:22.020
neurosurgeon, but none of us have earned the right

38
00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:25.020
to have our needs be considered more important than anyone

39
00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:30.179
else's. And so, uh it's one thing to

40
00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.770
try to answer the question of free will. I

41
00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:37.389
mean, if it exists or not, but another

42
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:43.110
thing is why and when people believe in free will

43
00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:46.429
, I mean, are there specific cues that people

44
00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.179
pay attention to specific variables that play a role in

45
00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.088
how much free will people attribute to themselves or to

46
00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.288
someone else when evaluating a particular action? Well,

47
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.490
you're right and people almost universally uh believe that they

48
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.729
are the agents of their action. Um Like 90%

49
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.169
of philosophers fall into a camp uh called compatible list

50
00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.788
views of free will. These are people, they're

51
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.618
not saying there's magic, they're not taking theological stances

52
00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.360
, whatever they say. Yeah, the world is

53
00:03:29.368 --> 00:03:31.558
made of atoms, we're made of cells like we

54
00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.110
believe in all that stuff. Yet, somehow here's

55
00:03:37.118 --> 00:03:38.919
how free will still like pops out of your brain

56
00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:42.500
and do a lot of hand waving at that point

57
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.258
. Um So it's incredibly common view. Um Like

58
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.500
all of our other features of our beliefs and temperaments

59
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.889
, um It's kind of context dependent people really,

60
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:58.250
really are more likely to believe in free will if

61
00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:01.580
someone's complimenting them and saying good job, they're really

62
00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:06.050
looking like to like, likely to under circumstances where

63
00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:09.949
things have come up short. I mean, there's

64
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.929
, there's this classic dichotomy and sort of us,

65
00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.910
them thinking that with them, when thems do something

66
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.369
awful, it's constitutional. That's what they're like.

67
00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.649
They've always been like, they'll always be like,

68
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.009
and when one of us does something awful, it's

69
00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:30.569
situational. Yeah, you have to understand they were

70
00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:33.670
under a lot of stress, there were financial pressures

71
00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:36.170
, they had just been whatever, um, as

72
00:04:36.178 --> 00:04:43.059
to how stable our us this is and we're often

73
00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.829
being pretty nasty when we're attributing unchangeable them ness to

74
00:04:48.838 --> 00:04:51.949
them. Um, in that regard, we're very

75
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:57.588
, very malleable when it comes to how characteristically free

76
00:04:57.858 --> 00:05:00.980
we are. When things are going well, people

77
00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:04.048
believe in free will when things are not, there's

78
00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.699
a tendency to go in the other direction but not

79
00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:10.488
in a globalized. There's no free will whatsoever.

80
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.928
Here's the extenuating circumstance that screwed me up just now

81
00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.250
that kept me from being the wondrous free, consistent

82
00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.329
person that I am. Yeah, something came up

83
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:25.769
. But overall, overall we are the captains of

84
00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:30.129
our fate. Mhm But uh let me ask you

85
00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:38.019
about one criticism that perhaps many people, scientists particularly

86
00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:43.399
would have of uh your position. So we have

87
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:46.980
a, a good understanding or at least to some

88
00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:49.309
extent of the science of human behavior, the factors

89
00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.170
that play a role there uh from genetics to the

90
00:05:54.178 --> 00:05:58.009
environment and culture. But uh I mean, there's

91
00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.889
still lots and lots of details that we are missing

92
00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.119
. And it's really hard to be able to predict

93
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:12.079
with a very high level of accuracy how people will

94
00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:15.980
behave in any particular point in time. So,

95
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.959
the fact that there's still fairly low predictability, do

96
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.358
you think that that's an argument against your position?

97
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.709
Um No, and that's, that's like a fantastic

98
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.838
counter ment to bring up because it's very essential.

99
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.139
It, it obviously is very essential. Um Like

100
00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.699
I, I have sort of a hobby by now

101
00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:46.100
that I uh help uh public defenders uh who are

102
00:06:46.108 --> 00:06:49.170
lawyers defending poor people who can't afford uh their own

103
00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:54.338
lawyers in murder cases for people who have a history

104
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.139
of traumatic childhoods, uh concussive head trauma and such

105
00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:01.720
teaching juries about the brain. And what always happens

106
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.519
is I get to do a two hour presentation and

107
00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:10.459
then the prosecuting attorney gets to cross examine me and

108
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.928
they always nail me on exactly these lines. So

109
00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:16.790
, are you saying every single person with this type

110
00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:19.619
of brain damage would do what this guy did?

111
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.470
I'd say, no, we can't say that.

112
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.709
Could you have predicted this guy? No, we

113
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.959
can't. Um Part of it, a fundamentally deep

114
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:39.139
response is um when you look at uh chaotic systems

115
00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:42.889
, systems that run on chaotic system, like us

116
00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.899
, our brains, our cells, our molecules,

117
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.750
our societies, um a critical thing about them is

118
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:55.699
they are unpredictable. They're still deterministic and lots of

119
00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:00.139
people mistake sort of chaotic and the unpredictability of it

120
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:03.500
as proof that somehow we could transcend our molecules.

121
00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:07.699
But on that level, in this very fundamental way

122
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.278
, um systems that are entirely deterministic can nonetheless be

123
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.480
completely unpredictable. A much more mundane answer is,

124
00:08:16.738 --> 00:08:20.619
well, yeah, we're still finding out stuff.

125
00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:24.619
And when you look at our knowledge about sort of

126
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.750
the biology of human behavior, like 99% of what

127
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:31.579
we've learned about it has been in the last century

128
00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:35.250
, 75% has been in the last 50 years,

129
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.918
51% has been in the last decade, 25% of

130
00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:43.918
it has been since like we started this broadcast or

131
00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:46.609
whatever, like the rate at which knowledge is pouring

132
00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:50.629
in is incredibly fast. So there, there's this

133
00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:54.830
sort of indirect cheating strategy that one can then say

134
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.389
, which is OK if we're all going to accept

135
00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:01.798
that tonight. At midnight. That's it. Science

136
00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:03.529
is done. We're never gonna find out anything new

137
00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:05.599
again. This is everything we know at this point

138
00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:07.379
. The answer is, yeah. Nonetheless, we

139
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:11.320
can't predict a whole lot about human behavior. Um

140
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:16.178
But everything we know about the exponential increase in knowledge

141
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.859
is over and over and over, we're gonna continue

142
00:09:18.869 --> 00:09:22.200
this pattern of saying, oh, I had no

143
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.080
idea. Biology had something to do with that.

144
00:09:26.729 --> 00:09:30.340
And like you have a choice at this point,

145
00:09:30.349 --> 00:09:33.769
do you wanna be on the cutting edge of viewing

146
00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:35.769
that we are nothing more or less than biological machines

147
00:09:35.798 --> 00:09:39.529
or do you wanna be like the history of science

148
00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:43.308
example in a century of just the primitiveness of what

149
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.580
people still believed at the time. And so one

150
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.038
of the things uh also that people bring to the

151
00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:56.960
table in discussions surrounding free will and that people use

152
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.538
in law and in the courtroom has to do with

153
00:10:00.548 --> 00:10:05.769
intent. So, from a scientific perspective, what

154
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:09.080
is intent exactly? And what do we know about

155
00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:13.639
it? And do you think that its intent in

156
00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:18.908
any way would make for a good case for free

157
00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.690
will in any way? Yes. Let me,

158
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.200
let me just be really uh sort of over the

159
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.769
top here. Um As a scientist, my definition

160
00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:33.058
of intent as a subject to consider when thinking about

161
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.219
free will. Um intent can be defined as boring

162
00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:41.719
as hell and totally irrelevant. Um OK. Why

163
00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:45.580
is that? Um the entire legal system, as

164
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.928
you said, runs on that. Um, when

165
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.340
somebody did something awful, did they intend to do

166
00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:54.330
it? And did they know that they had alternative

167
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.058
options? Um And did they understand what the consequences

168
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.389
were going to be? Um And if the answer

169
00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:03.298
to all of that is? Yeah, lock them

170
00:11:03.308 --> 00:11:05.649
up. They intended to do what they did and

171
00:11:05.658 --> 00:11:11.219
they knew there were alternatives. Um And in sort

172
00:11:11.229 --> 00:11:15.979
of the neuroscience world of free will where intent comes

173
00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:20.519
in is the most influential crazy making experiment of all

174
00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:22.629
time in the field. This is something that came

175
00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.619
in the early 19 eighties by a man named Benjamin

176
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:28.969
Lit. And you read any paper about the biology

177
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:33.989
of free will and like the person is almost required

178
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.879
by law to mention lit by the second paragraph,

179
00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:39.038
these were these amazing studies. He took people and

180
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:43.879
wired them up with sort of electroencephalograms, eegs to

181
00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.359
record brain activity in different areas. This was like

182
00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:50.629
Neanderthal era technology at the time, you couldn't do

183
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.710
brain imaging then. But this very simple approach.

184
00:11:52.729 --> 00:11:58.690
Um he said to people, OK, whenever you

185
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.229
want, press this button and they had things to

186
00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:07.330
tell when the pressing process actually started by seeing when

187
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.859
muscles started constricting in his arm. And they could

188
00:12:09.869 --> 00:12:13.408
see what was happening in the motor cortex, the

189
00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:16.460
part of the brain telling those muscles and they could

190
00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.538
see the parts of the brain that would tell another

191
00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:22.609
part to tell another part to tell the motor cortex

192
00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.239
to do that. And the earth shattering finding that

193
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.288
he came up with was all of this playing out

194
00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:31.219
in about a half second or so. You could

195
00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:35.879
tell when the brain had decided it was time to

196
00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:39.969
press the button because before the person was conscious of

197
00:12:39.979 --> 00:12:45.239
their intention to do it by about 200 milliseconds,

198
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.129
2/10 of a second. And oh my God,

199
00:12:48.178 --> 00:12:54.048
your brain has decided before you were conscious of intending

200
00:12:54.058 --> 00:12:58.009
to do this. And everyone like went crazy over

201
00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:01.479
this because this is just proven there was no free

202
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:05.928
will until like people started arguing about. When do

203
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.009
you become aware of intention? And is that different

204
00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:11.239
from when you intend to do something? And,

205
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.960
and you know, all this philosophical stuff of,

206
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:18.548
is there a difference between intending to do something and

207
00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:22.808
intending to stop yourself from doing something? The difference

208
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.279
between free will and free won't? And they're still

209
00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:30.440
fighting about this. This is 40 years later for

210
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.090
a scientist, there was like a paper a couple

211
00:13:31.099 --> 00:13:35.149
of years ago entitled like Livid. Had no idea

212
00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:39.119
what he was talking about or, or something slightly

213
00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:41.908
more like formal than that for people to still be

214
00:13:41.918 --> 00:13:46.090
telling you that your science was wrong 40 years after

215
00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:48.548
you did it, this is like immortality for a

216
00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:52.109
scientist. They're still fighting about what this finding means

217
00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:56.450
. Does your brain know that you're intending to do

218
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.219
something before you're consciously aware of it. And I

219
00:14:01.229 --> 00:14:03.418
scream every time I see yet another one of these

220
00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:07.359
studies because as I said, it's boring as hell

221
00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:11.479
and totally irrelevant. And in a courtroom as well

222
00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:13.899
, did this person intend to do that? Because

223
00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:18.009
none of it asks the only relevant question there is

224
00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:20.178
. Oh, yeah. Where did that intent come

225
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.408
from? Where did it come from in the first

226
00:14:24.418 --> 00:14:28.590
place? Because to answer the question of, did

227
00:14:28.599 --> 00:14:31.389
the brain have intent before you did that's playing out

228
00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:35.869
in 2/10 of a second when you're asking, where

229
00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:39.489
did that intent come from? What does that have

230
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.479
to do with what was going on in your brain

231
00:14:41.558 --> 00:14:45.048
one second ago? And what was happening in the

232
00:14:45.058 --> 00:14:48.729
environment one minute ago? And what hormone levels were

233
00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:52.908
like one day ago and how traumatic or stimulating the

234
00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:56.428
previous one year had been and what your adolescence was

235
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.080
like in your childhood and your fetal life and your

236
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:03.158
genes and the culture your ancestors invented because that influenced

237
00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.769
how your mother was raising you within a minute of

238
00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:09.119
birth. Where did that intent come from? And

239
00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:13.668
the metaphor I use in the book is deciding whether

240
00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:16.399
or not there's free will based on what's going on

241
00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:20.830
in that last half second and only knowing what the

242
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.479
intent was is like deciding whether you like a movie

243
00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:26.149
or not by just having seen the final three minutes

244
00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:31.678
of it because you've missed everything. It doesn't matter

245
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.320
if the person intended to or not. Where did

246
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.779
that intent come from? And that's where the legal

247
00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:43.320
system falls apart in terms of their thinking about,

248
00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:46.399
you know, punishment and blame. And that's where

249
00:15:46.408 --> 00:15:50.580
most thinking about whether or not there's free will falls

250
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.739
apart because everybody is just interested in their brain imaging

251
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.109
studies telling you what happened in the last three milliseconds

252
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.859
. And that tells you nothing because something about what

253
00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:03.849
happened to you this morning had something to do with

254
00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:07.109
it. Something about your fetal life had something to

255
00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:10.979
do with it. Something about the culture, your

256
00:16:10.989 --> 00:16:14.908
answer came up with 500 years ago, had something

257
00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:15.538
to do with it. And when you look at

258
00:16:15.548 --> 00:16:19.889
all those pieces from one second before to millennia before

259
00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:22.500
and you put all those pieces together, there's not

260
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:26.090
a damn inch in there to shoehorn in an ocean

261
00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:30.090
of free will operating independent of all of that stuff

262
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:36.489
. Mhm So when it comes to behavioral science,

263
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.129
we always hear about nature versus nurture genes, the

264
00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:45.649
environment does when it comes to free will specifically,

265
00:16:45.658 --> 00:16:52.288
does it matter at all if uh we're talking about

266
00:16:52.308 --> 00:16:56.580
uh for example, biological factors or environmental factors?

267
00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.719
I mean, do we have any more control,

268
00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:04.368
for example, over our environment and how it affects

269
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.140
our behavior than we have over our gyms, for

270
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:15.199
example, zero in both cases in the fundamental ways

271
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:17.930
. I mean, what one is obliged to do

272
00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:21.180
in my business at this point is saying, nature

273
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:23.420
and nurture always interact and you can't pull them apart

274
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:29.009
and asking which contributes more is like what's contributing more

275
00:17:29.019 --> 00:17:32.660
to the area of this rectangle, the length or

276
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.299
the width they always interact and that sort of thing

277
00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:40.390
um within this realm. Um The summary I would

278
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.380
get at is we are nothing more or less than

279
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.489
the sum of our biology, which we had no

280
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.588
control over and its interactions with the sum of our

281
00:17:51.598 --> 00:17:55.750
environment over which we had no control over. And

282
00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:59.209
they're completely inseparable. I mean, it's the simplest

283
00:17:59.219 --> 00:18:02.939
example of like, oh, how important was environment

284
00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.729
in this sort of case and its interaction with biology

285
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.189
? Wow, what explains the fact that I'm sitting

286
00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:14.750
here right now and have a occupation that carries some

287
00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:17.640
prestige and westernized culture and all of that, what

288
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.199
did environment have to do with it? Starting with

289
00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:22.779
environment prenatal environment. The fact that my, my

290
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:29.779
mother was not suffering from malaria or Chagas disease or

291
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:33.000
like any such thing and wasn't protein starved because she

292
00:18:33.009 --> 00:18:37.098
was a nomadic pastoralist in the Sahel, in Africa

293
00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:40.150
. And like, oh, like we're talking like

294
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.219
at that level already. That's like what we're talking

295
00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:48.059
already at that level. That's part of the brain

296
00:18:48.068 --> 00:18:52.130
that you wound up being uh handed to you here

297
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.219
in adulthood. Um All of that stuff matters and

298
00:18:56.229 --> 00:19:00.799
it's inseparable. Mhm One very interesting thing that you

299
00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:06.029
talk about in the book is the Behavioral Science slash

300
00:19:06.039 --> 00:19:11.219
Biology of luck. What is that about it?

301
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:17.160
It's, that's ultimately everything, everything we're talking about

302
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.368
here. Um Another way of saying, oh,

303
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.459
the sum of our biology and this interaction with the

304
00:19:22.469 --> 00:19:26.199
sum of our environment is we are nothing more or

305
00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:30.719
less than the outcome of our luck and anyone who

306
00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:37.299
claims otherwise that they earned their good luck or that

307
00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:40.449
it makes sense to punish them for their bad luck

308
00:19:40.588 --> 00:19:45.130
. Um All we are is the outcome of biology

309
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.108
, interacting with environment in the context of luck.

310
00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:52.588
And there's this whole thing like child development, um

311
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.019
try to make sense of who turns out to be

312
00:19:56.029 --> 00:20:00.219
like the the violent adults and the drug addicts and

313
00:20:00.229 --> 00:20:03.410
all the, all the bad outcomes and like no

314
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.779
surprise childhood has a huge amount to do with it

315
00:20:07.318 --> 00:20:11.789
and it's been formalized into this thing. Um At

316
00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:15.289
least in sort of uh United States called your ace

317
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:21.838
score A ce the sum of your adverse childhood experiences

318
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:26.338
. And there's this ace like questionnaire scoring system where

319
00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:30.789
you can get from 0 to 10 and zero is

320
00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:33.219
you had no adversity 10 is like you had all

321
00:20:33.229 --> 00:20:37.328
of the following 10 horrible things happen to you.

322
00:20:37.368 --> 00:20:42.789
Were you a witness to physical violence or psychological violence

323
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:48.170
at home? Were you a victim of physical violence

324
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.838
or psychological violence? Were you a victim of sexual

325
00:20:51.848 --> 00:20:53.809
abuse? Were you in a broken family? Was

326
00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:56.500
there a weapon at home when you was there,

327
00:20:56.509 --> 00:21:00.049
a family member who was incarcerated this whole list there

328
00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:03.068
going from 0 to 10. Um, and what

329
00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:07.150
you see is for every single step, every point

330
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.400
you add to somebody's ace score. Um, there's

331
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.559
about a 35% increased likelihood that they're going to be

332
00:21:15.568 --> 00:21:21.170
involved in violent antisocial behavior by the time they're adult

333
00:21:21.318 --> 00:21:23.420
. If they're a male, there's about a 35%

334
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.229
increased chance that they're gonna have a teenage pregnancy.

335
00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:30.750
If they're female, about a 35% increased chance of

336
00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:34.660
either that they're gonna have substance abuse and addiction problems

337
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.509
every step in the way. And this is one

338
00:21:37.519 --> 00:21:42.689
way of formalizing like this is the quantified science of

339
00:21:42.699 --> 00:21:47.019
shitty luck in childhood. And it has always struck

340
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:48.469
me that at the same time. Instead of making

341
00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:53.318
it an adverse childhood experience score, you could make

342
00:21:53.328 --> 00:22:00.049
a ridiculously lucky childhood experience score. Did your parent

343
00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:03.930
or parents read books to you? Did you have

344
00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:07.769
a stable income? Um Did you never have to

345
00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:11.939
worry about food? Did you play games and laugh

346
00:22:11.949 --> 00:22:14.019
at home? Whatever? Come up with a score

347
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:15.769
of that and it's gonna tell you forever. Each

348
00:22:15.779 --> 00:22:18.459
step in those, there's a 35% increase that you're

349
00:22:18.469 --> 00:22:23.390
gonna be working a prestigious white collar job someday and

350
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.729
have an office and a secretary or who knows just

351
00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:30.868
a different way of explaining the same thing. Um

352
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.459
Everything that we frame as morality is instead the outcome

353
00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:41.500
or of good or bad luck. And we have

354
00:22:41.509 --> 00:22:47.209
built a world in which we punish or reward people

355
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.979
over the luck they had nothing to do with.

356
00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:53.479
Mhm. But, uh, as we go through

357
00:22:53.549 --> 00:23:00.838
, uh childhood adolescence, adulthood and our prefrontal cortices

358
00:23:00.848 --> 00:23:06.779
develop, we tend to gain or acquire more self-control

359
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:11.390
, more impulse control. Does that not count at

360
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.309
least as a few more degrees of rhythm? Right

361
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.848
. Let's look at the sentence you just said as

362
00:23:18.858 --> 00:23:22.469
we get older, don't we acquire more frontal cortical

363
00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:27.019
self control? What does acquire mean? It means

364
00:23:27.078 --> 00:23:30.199
you're lucky enough to be in an environment that would

365
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:33.799
have taught you that it means you're lucky enough to

366
00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:37.588
have a brain at that point where you could learn

367
00:23:37.598 --> 00:23:41.009
from those experiences. It means that you're lucky enough

368
00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:44.118
that the counter examples every day when you finish school

369
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.368
and went outside and there was the, your gang

370
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.890
telling you let's go rob that liquor store. Um

371
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:55.189
Let's do something impulsive that reinforces your frontal cortex not

372
00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:57.078
working very well. How many of those were going

373
00:23:57.088 --> 00:24:00.118
on at the end of the day? Do you

374
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.420
go home and you're bullied by somebody at home and

375
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.098
anything you heard during the day about like the wonderful

376
00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:10.269
path ahead of you? Thanks to self control goes

377
00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:14.250
out the window. Be Yeah, we learned.

378
00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:17.459
Oh, wow. Didn't you learn somewhere along the

379
00:24:17.469 --> 00:24:18.539
way that self control is a bad thing for you

380
00:24:18.568 --> 00:24:23.618
if you're a fetus and your mother is very stressed

381
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.578
and secreting a lot of stress hormones. You're going

382
00:24:26.588 --> 00:24:30.098
to be born with a frontal cortex that's already less

383
00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:34.654
developed than average and newborns. Meaning 15 years later

384
00:24:34.664 --> 00:24:37.654
, you're getting great lessons in life about the importance

385
00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:40.723
of self control. And by the time you were

386
00:24:40.733 --> 00:24:44.574
a damn fetus, you were already less likely than

387
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:48.535
average to be able to learn those lessons and benefit

388
00:24:48.545 --> 00:24:52.255
from them every step along the way. Where did

389
00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:53.785
that intent come from? Where did that learning come

390
00:24:53.795 --> 00:24:56.664
from? Where did the opportunity for that learning come

391
00:24:56.674 --> 00:25:00.588
from? And it's always, you know, all

392
00:25:00.598 --> 00:25:03.390
that stuff that brought you to this moment over which

393
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.759
you had no control. And when it comes to

394
00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:11.789
our psychological traits, we know, for example,

395
00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:17.009
from disciplines like behavior genetics that there's the role of

396
00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:21.049
genes and then the shared environment, the non shared

397
00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:25.969
environment, unique experiences we go through. Isn't there

398
00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:30.009
any space at all there for some, uh I

399
00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:33.410
mean, for us to have some sort of be

400
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.289
, be able to play some active role in the

401
00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:41.910
kind of person that we're going to become? Absolutely

402
00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:45.818
. Um And that's one of the ways in which

403
00:25:47.209 --> 00:25:51.469
uh people should avoid the hysteria of deciding genes,

404
00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:55.108
determine everything that genes are the most interesting things.

405
00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:56.130
If nothing else, you have this whole field of

406
00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:02.318
epigenetics, the ways in which experience can change how

407
00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:03.969
readily genes of yours are turned on or off.

408
00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:07.088
For the rest of your life in some cases.

409
00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:10.049
OK. So we're moved away from a genetic deterministic

410
00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:12.328
picture for a zillion reasons, uh both biological and

411
00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:17.729
environmental. Um But you're saying, can't we choose

412
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.199
to take an action to take a conscious action which

413
00:26:22.209 --> 00:26:26.759
will change our destiny? And the answer is not

414
00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:30.779
in the slightest, you look at two people who

415
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:33.838
were given an opportunity and one is this person who

416
00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:38.578
every single split in the road, they always take

417
00:26:38.588 --> 00:26:42.420
the wrong direction. They never miss an opportunity to

418
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.939
miss an opportunity at everyone. You could have.

419
00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:49.439
They, they would have given you that job.

420
00:26:49.469 --> 00:26:52.439
They were offering you a scholarship. The guy said

421
00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:55.559
you didn't have to drive the car when they were

422
00:26:55.568 --> 00:26:57.439
going to do the robbery and oh my God,

423
00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:03.608
every time that person makes the wrong choice, every

424
00:27:03.618 --> 00:27:07.739
time they come up with the wrong intent and where

425
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.328
did that come from? And when we seemingly have

426
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:17.769
made a major decision on our part about something in

427
00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:21.739
life, are you going to rob the store?

428
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.289
Are you going to study hard? Are you gonna

429
00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:26.559
propose marriage to this person or you? Who knows

430
00:27:26.568 --> 00:27:33.269
what? Um And that feels intent. Um Everything

431
00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:36.000
about the biology and this interaction with the environment that

432
00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:38.979
came before that is what brought you to that moment

433
00:27:40.108 --> 00:27:45.539
. Like from everything. Like if you're hungry,

434
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.769
you're more likely to commit an antisocial violent act.

435
00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:55.189
If somebody smells good to you, their pheromones,

436
00:27:55.199 --> 00:27:57.029
you're more likely to find them. You claim that

437
00:27:57.039 --> 00:28:00.380
they are more vis visually physically attractive if you,

438
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:06.000
you know all this stuff, what, what this

439
00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:07.680
, at the split in the road? Do you

440
00:28:07.689 --> 00:28:10.439
make the right decision or not? What this taps

441
00:28:10.449 --> 00:28:14.568
into is? I think the most pernicious way in

442
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.519
which people hold on to. Yes. Yes.

443
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:18.670
Yes. Yes. There's biology and we have brains

444
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.250
and all of that and it just made a brain

445
00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:22.479
gunk. Um, but we have free will,

446
00:28:22.489 --> 00:28:26.239
we have free will. Is this dichotomy people bring

447
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:32.650
in? You look at somebody who's 7 ft four

448
00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.130
and of course, they're a great basketball player or

449
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.239
you look at somebody and they have particular ratio of

450
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.750
slow twitch to fast twitch fibers in their leg muscles

451
00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:45.348
and of course they turn out to be a good

452
00:28:45.358 --> 00:28:52.078
marathoner or maybe even you understand enough about receptors for

453
00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:55.250
this or that neurotransmitter. And of course they have

454
00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:57.180
a good memory or good. Any of these.

455
00:28:57.189 --> 00:29:02.900
We're pretty good at accepting the biology of what our

456
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.358
natural attributes are. Some people have lovely voices and

457
00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:10.439
others don't. And they're never gonna sing in an

458
00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:12.920
opera. Some people have, yes, there's these

459
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:17.039
natural attributes. OK. Ok. Ok. Science

460
00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.259
biology has something to do with that. But oh

461
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:22.449
, where free will comes in is what you do

462
00:29:22.459 --> 00:29:26.920
with your attributes? Do you squander them? Do

463
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.588
you work hard to overcome your limitations? Do you

464
00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:33.489
, are you one of these people like you go

465
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.769
on youtube and there's unbelievable examples of this, of

466
00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:41.469
like marathoners and like important races where they collapse 53

467
00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:45.000
ft from the finish line and they crawl, they

468
00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:48.598
crawl to the very end. And you say,

469
00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:52.858
oh my God, this is amazing with what they

470
00:29:52.868 --> 00:29:55.160
did with what they were given. Or you find

471
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.318
like somebody raised in poverty in a horrible neighborhood and

472
00:29:57.328 --> 00:30:02.519
all of that who somehow winds up like with their

473
00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:04.000
Nobel Prize at the other end, or somebody who

474
00:30:04.009 --> 00:30:07.549
grows up in great wealth and privilege and they're a

475
00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:11.519
junkie by the time they're 20 they've spent half their

476
00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:15.299
fortune. Oh, your attributes you have no control

477
00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:18.959
over. That's the biology. What do you do

478
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:22.269
with the attributes? That's where we have a world

479
00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:26.209
of, oh, what a self indulgent squander.

480
00:30:26.309 --> 00:30:29.949
What an inspiring role model, how they worked to

481
00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:34.009
overcome. There's something in there that we believe that

482
00:30:34.019 --> 00:30:38.400
things like your memory or whether you have perfect pitch

483
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.519
or things like that are made of biology and how

484
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:47.920
hard you work and your self control and how indulgent

485
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.039
you are and all of that somehow that's made of

486
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.939
other stuff that's not made of biology. And when

487
00:30:53.949 --> 00:30:56.410
you look at it like what happened to you as

488
00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.199
a fetus is going to have something to do with

489
00:31:00.209 --> 00:31:02.959
the construction of your part of the brain that has

490
00:31:02.969 --> 00:31:06.250
something to do with whether it splits in the road

491
00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:10.469
, you always make the bad decision, you every

492
00:31:10.479 --> 00:31:14.150
step of this is biology as well. Um But

493
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:21.098
there's this very strong emotional pull to differentiate between the

494
00:31:21.108 --> 00:31:27.059
two and willpower and backbone and fortitude and all of

495
00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:30.309
that, that's the stuff we admire because that's the

496
00:31:30.318 --> 00:31:34.750
true measure of who somebody is independent of their neurons

497
00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:37.598
and molecules of it's made of the same stuff.

498
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:45.449
And so um is there any space for an idea

499
00:31:45.459 --> 00:31:51.029
like meritocracy in this sort of deterministic world? I

500
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:55.068
mean, if someone just so happens to have the

501
00:31:55.078 --> 00:31:59.180
psychological traits that tend to correlate with success, for

502
00:31:59.189 --> 00:32:05.299
example, in industrialized societies, like greed, conscientiousness

503
00:32:05.309 --> 00:32:07.559
, high intelligence and so on. Should we at

504
00:32:07.809 --> 00:32:10.380
from, from a scientific perspective? Of course,

505
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:15.299
I'm not talking about uh philosophy, a philosophical perspective

506
00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:17.118
nor any of that. Does it make sense to

507
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:22.989
attribute any personal merit to them? Yeah. Um

508
00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:32.140
The only possible, scientifically acceptable and morally acceptable conclusion

509
00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:37.680
from all of this is there's no circumstance in which

510
00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:45.670
blame and punishment make moral sense or are uh are

511
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.279
good things in and of themselves. And likewise,

512
00:32:49.289 --> 00:32:52.559
there's no circumstance in which praise and reward are virtues

513
00:32:52.568 --> 00:32:55.939
in and of themselves because nobody earned one or the

514
00:32:55.949 --> 00:32:59.618
other, that sort of thing. This comes with

515
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:06.400
two provisos though um the first one is like every

516
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.338
now and then it's useful to punish someone because it

517
00:33:09.348 --> 00:33:13.880
changes their behavior in an effective way or it's useful

518
00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.848
to praise somebody because in an instrumental sense. Um

519
00:33:19.709 --> 00:33:22.818
Praise and blame could be useful, not because of

520
00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:24.650
what somebody did in the past that this is retribute

521
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.380
but for shaping their future behavior just in like a

522
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.279
psychological engineering kind of way. Um So that's not

523
00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:36.539
saying it's not possible, it's never useful, but

524
00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:42.719
just as another way of influence the influencing the biological

525
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:46.979
machine. Um The more fundamental level is when you

526
00:33:46.989 --> 00:33:52.160
say crazy stuff like I just did to people they

527
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:57.289
say, oh, so you want just murderers running

528
00:33:57.299 --> 00:34:00.789
around the streets or? Oh, you just want

529
00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:04.500
it randomly picked who's going to do brain surgery to

530
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:07.519
take out your tumor. No, of course not

531
00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:10.260
. Even if you get rid of the entire criminal

532
00:34:10.269 --> 00:34:15.228
justice system as it now appears. And as we

533
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:19.559
should, because it's built on biological nonsense of the

534
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.978
most destructive kind. Nonetheless, people who are uncontrollably

535
00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:27.349
dangerous and violent where you can't fix them, you

536
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.829
gotta protect people from them. Um, a car

537
00:34:30.858 --> 00:34:32.887
whose brakes don't work. You don't let it out

538
00:34:32.898 --> 00:34:36.088
on the street, you put it in the garage

539
00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:37.849
and you like, don't drive it, but you

540
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:43.117
don't preach to either that violent person or to the

541
00:34:43.128 --> 00:34:45.289
car whose brakes don't work that they have a crummy

542
00:34:45.298 --> 00:34:49.628
rotten soul and they don't deserve to be able to

543
00:34:49.637 --> 00:34:52.489
do this and what you have to do instead is

544
00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:55.717
use a term that's more and more in like this

545
00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:59.349
. People thinking this way is they have to be

546
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.989
quarantined, quarantine them so that they're not dangerous to

547
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.958
anyone and not an inch more. And not because

548
00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:09.050
there's anything about it that they deserve the brakes don't

549
00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:13.159
work on their car and then the flip side is

550
00:35:13.168 --> 00:35:15.228
exactly the same. Oh, my God. So

551
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:16.489
, what, we should just have a random lottery

552
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.510
as to who, who, like, does brain

553
00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:24.050
surgery on you. No, of course not.

554
00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:28.550
Just as you can't have dangerous people on the street

555
00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:32.159
, You need the most competent people out there doing

556
00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:37.510
the medicine, doing the legal stuff, writing whatever

557
00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:42.820
it is that takes um skill that matters, that's

558
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:45.898
really important. But you just the same, you

559
00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:49.869
can't sit there and tell that person because they have

560
00:35:49.878 --> 00:35:53.019
a wonderful soul or a wonderful self discipline or whatever

561
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.889
that they deserve to have this ridiculously large income.

562
00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:02.378
Like a world built around blaming people for their antisocial

563
00:36:02.389 --> 00:36:06.938
behavior makes no sense. And a world built around

564
00:36:06.949 --> 00:36:10.260
rewarding people for their prosocial behavior or their expertise makes

565
00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:15.539
no sense either. Um And is ultimately just as

566
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:22.728
morally corrupt because if you say you are a brain

567
00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:28.938
surgeon and getting enormous societal prestige because you did something

568
00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:30.780
where you earned it, you deserve to do that

569
00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:35.119
and be in that position makes as little sense biologically

570
00:36:35.128 --> 00:36:38.079
as saying the brain, the uh the murderer with

571
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.668
a history of frontal cortical damage deserves to be in

572
00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:44.639
prison all of that. Um Yeah, it's the

573
00:36:44.648 --> 00:36:47.000
flip side. A meritocracy makes no sense. A

574
00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:52.429
justice system built around retribution makes no sense either.

575
00:36:52.458 --> 00:36:55.188
But at the same time, dangerous people should not

576
00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:59.628
be allowed to damage people. And competent people should

577
00:36:59.639 --> 00:37:00.989
be more likely to be running the world than less

578
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.179
competent people. But no one should feel shame or

579
00:37:06.188 --> 00:37:09.059
pride for which end of those Katina they wind up

580
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:15.829
on. But even if there's not really space for

581
00:37:16.148 --> 00:37:21.860
blame or praise or to consider or to think that

582
00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:25.260
someone is responsible for their own actions, do you

583
00:37:25.269 --> 00:37:29.699
think that it would still make sense to talk about

584
00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:34.958
punishment? At least as a deterrence measure or for

585
00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:39.000
example, blaming or praising someone just because we know

586
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:44.489
scientifically that if we do that, we would be

587
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:50.958
disincentivizing bad behavior, incentivizing good behavior and conditioning people

588
00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:57.360
to behave in better ways. Absolutely. And it's

589
00:37:57.369 --> 00:38:00.878
the same biology that like you take a, a

590
00:38:00.889 --> 00:38:05.090
sea snail and it could learn that when you like

591
00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:07.409
bop it on the head with a pencil, it

592
00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:10.989
retracts its gill mechanism or some. Yeah, you

593
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.148
can shape sea snails behavior, you could shape human

594
00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:19.188
behavior, you could shape human behavior to be more

595
00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:20.909
or less adaptive, blah, blah, all of

596
00:38:20.918 --> 00:38:22.813
that. And yeah. Yeah, sometimes it requires

597
00:38:22.824 --> 00:38:28.094
punishment and sometimes it requires praise and reward. Um

598
00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:32.425
But just because that's like another thing you can do

599
00:38:32.554 --> 00:38:37.724
, sometimes intervene with somebody who's got problems and make

600
00:38:37.735 --> 00:38:43.043
sure they uh they get enough calories in their diet

601
00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:45.989
and things will go better sometimes like you hit someone

602
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.010
over the head and say they, they can't do

603
00:38:49.019 --> 00:38:52.250
this anymore and they'll stop doing some rotten behavior.

604
00:38:52.378 --> 00:38:55.378
Yes. But never with a sense that you are

605
00:38:55.389 --> 00:39:00.280
doing a moral good because that's completely irrelevant. It's

606
00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:07.039
just another realm in which we as biological machines can

607
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:10.708
be shaped in our behavior. And what do you

608
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:15.340
think about, uh, the idea that some people

609
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:17.250
put forth that, uh, ok, even if

610
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.389
we know that free will does not exist that it

611
00:39:22.398 --> 00:39:25.050
doesn't make sense to talk about free will. People

612
00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:30.090
should still believe in free will because if they don't

613
00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:34.329
, they will be worse people. I mean,

614
00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.530
do you, or do you think on the other

615
00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:39.539
hand that, uh, telling people that, uh

616
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.728
, they should abandon their belief in free will would

617
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.898
actually improve their lives? Ok. This is,

618
00:39:47.909 --> 00:39:52.619
this is ultimately like the most important question to ask

619
00:39:52.628 --> 00:39:54.300
whether or not we have free will. Should we

620
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:59.458
all believe that we do? Um, one worry

621
00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:00.820
which you bring up is if we stop believing in

622
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:05.458
free will, we're all gonna become murderers and cheats

623
00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.684
and liars and we will run amok. Um And

624
00:40:07.695 --> 00:40:10.844
this is the thing people worry about, uh,

625
00:40:10.853 --> 00:40:17.635
most instantly and there's a cruel experimental psychology literature showing

626
00:40:17.644 --> 00:40:22.324
that if you take like volunteer test subjects and you

627
00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:25.844
manipulate them into feeling like there is less free will

628
00:40:25.853 --> 00:40:29.934
than they thought there was 10 minutes later, they're

629
00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:32.003
more likely to cheat on a test, they're more

630
00:40:32.014 --> 00:40:35.994
likely to do something crummy to somebody else. When

631
00:40:36.003 --> 00:40:39.579
they're playing a game, morality and ethical behavior goes

632
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:44.699
down. That's it. That's exactly what, like

633
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.769
the problem is when you tell people, um,

634
00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:51.478
like you can't be held responsible for anything. They've

635
00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:54.039
run amok. Just like if you convince someone that

636
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.938
there is no God and thus there's no punishment,

637
00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.250
they run amok also. And then you look closer

638
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.829
at it and because there's this parallel literature, you

639
00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:10.070
have test subjects and you convince them, manipulate them

640
00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:14.148
into believing, lesson God and right afterward, they

641
00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:15.628
cheat more and they do the same crummy stuff.

642
00:41:15.849 --> 00:41:20.250
But now you do a different version of these studies

643
00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:22.679
, get someone who comes in and says, I

644
00:41:22.688 --> 00:41:27.570
haven't believed in free will for 10 years or I

645
00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:30.878
haven't believed in God since I was a teenager or

646
00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:34.260
any. You get people who have thought that way

647
00:41:34.269 --> 00:41:37.099
and felt that way for a long time who got

648
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.809
there. Not because some like psychology professor is manipulating

649
00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.418
them in this environment. But you get people like

650
00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:47.938
that who've thought through this for a long time.

651
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.378
And they are exactly as moral as the most religious

652
00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:55.519
people and the people with the strongest sense of belief

653
00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.539
in free will. And this fascinates me, like

654
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.269
in terms of the God issue, you look at

655
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.168
people who very, very strongly believe in God and

656
00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:10.989
the whole show that goes along with that or very

657
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.599
, very strongly believes there is no God. And

658
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.510
as I said, there's no difference in their levels

659
00:42:16.519 --> 00:42:21.840
of ethical behavior and it's very high in both cases

660
00:42:21.849 --> 00:42:24.780
who are the ones who are less ethical, the

661
00:42:24.789 --> 00:42:28.250
ones who are in between, the ones who say

662
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.750
, oh, I don't know, I guess there's

663
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.199
God and like, I make sure the kids learn

664
00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:35.869
something about it because it's good for them and like

665
00:42:35.878 --> 00:42:38.199
, the, the ho are good or say God

666
00:42:38.208 --> 00:42:40.208
, I don't, I don't actually care. Maybe

667
00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:42.849
there's not a God, but it's like, what

668
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.809
does it have to do with me? The people

669
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:51.269
who are like indifferently religious or apathetically atheistic, the

670
00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.958
ones in the middle, those are the ones who

671
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:57.320
you readily manipulate their moral behavior, one direction or

672
00:42:57.329 --> 00:42:59.898
the other. If you've spent a hell of a

673
00:42:59.909 --> 00:43:04.789
long time sitting and thinking about the root of human

674
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.898
goodness and evil and what we owe our fellow humans

675
00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:13.139
and is their purpose in life that transcends us.

676
00:43:13.188 --> 00:43:15.559
It doesn't really matter if your conclusion is there is

677
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:19.438
a God or there is no God or we're free

678
00:43:19.449 --> 00:43:22.329
agents or we have no free will whatsoever. You're

679
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.659
one of the ones who thought long and hard about

680
00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:29.289
it and both sets of conclusions you come out as

681
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.780
being more ethically moral than your average person. Um

682
00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:38.469
So people are not going to run amok if they

683
00:43:38.478 --> 00:43:43.139
are raised from the very beginning to think this is

684
00:43:43.148 --> 00:43:45.179
not a world where it is fair. To blame

685
00:43:45.188 --> 00:43:47.599
anyone and I don't deserve to get this or that

686
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:52.059
reward more than anyone else. They're going to be

687
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.599
past the notion. Oh, no one's gonna hold

688
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.079
me responsible. I can go and stab the old

689
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.188
lady there with any luck to be past that by

690
00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:06.260
the time they're like, 20 years old. And

691
00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:09.688
I was here hearing all the time people saying that

692
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:15.179
hard determinist were all nihilists and atheists and they were

693
00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:19.780
all the time, uh, pillaging and raping and

694
00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:23.579
murdering people. Exactly. Because that's, that's the

695
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.409
logical first thing. Um, the logical second thing

696
00:44:28.418 --> 00:44:30.949
that was also, went back in your question is

697
00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:32.188
when you get past, oh, should I run

698
00:44:32.199 --> 00:44:35.938
amok and do whatever I want all of that is

699
00:44:35.949 --> 00:44:38.179
, should I get depressed as hell? Because there's

700
00:44:38.188 --> 00:44:42.619
no purpose to any of this? There's this huge

701
00:44:42.628 --> 00:44:46.820
existential void out there. Should I like, is

702
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:51.398
this terrible thing to have people believe in terms of

703
00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:53.559
their mental health and stuff? Um, and a

704
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.820
point, like, it took me five years to

705
00:44:57.829 --> 00:45:00.079
write this book and the 1st 4.5 years I was

706
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:04.309
thinking the answer to that was gonna have to be

707
00:45:04.409 --> 00:45:07.199
. Yeah. And that sucks. And it's awful

708
00:45:07.208 --> 00:45:08.280
. But, you know, that's how things work

709
00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:09.958
and, like, come on, we need to

710
00:45:09.969 --> 00:45:14.519
be adults and face reality and it finally struck me

711
00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:19.070
the much more meaningful answer to it, which is

712
00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:22.340
, if you are convinced there's no free will and

713
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:28.559
you get totally depressed and empty void because it means

714
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.280
your accomplishments. You didn't really earn that. The

715
00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:35.250
people who loved you don't really love you for who

716
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.878
you are. But for biological stuff that you helped

717
00:45:37.889 --> 00:45:40.719
this old woman cross the street just now. Not

718
00:45:40.728 --> 00:45:44.708
because you're a good person, but because that's how

719
00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:45.668
you function as machine. All that. Oh my

720
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:49.840
God. This is so depressing. If that's your

721
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:53.639
response, you're one of the lucky ones. You've

722
00:45:53.648 --> 00:45:57.438
got the luck and privilege to sit there and say

723
00:45:57.599 --> 00:46:00.360
, oh my God, maybe I really didn't earn

724
00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:04.239
my wonderful university degree. Oh my God. Maybe

725
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.478
I didn't really deserve to be liked by people because

726
00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:09.438
of my personality. If you're someone who has spent

727
00:46:09.449 --> 00:46:14.389
your whole life paying the price of your parents,

728
00:46:14.398 --> 00:46:19.199
poverty or the fact that you don't have an attractive

729
00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:22.119
face or the fact that you have the genes that

730
00:46:22.128 --> 00:46:25.679
deep predispose you towards obesity and people recoil from overweight

731
00:46:25.688 --> 00:46:29.280
people. Or because you turned out not to be

732
00:46:29.289 --> 00:46:30.860
so smart or it turns out you can't control your

733
00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:35.239
behavior because of biology. All that getting rid of

734
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:39.039
the free will concept does is be liberating. You

735
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:43.708
don't have a shitty soul because your life has not

736
00:46:43.719 --> 00:46:45.860
turned out that well. And for most people,

737
00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:50.219
that's the much more important outcome to all of this

738
00:46:50.228 --> 00:46:52.829
than deciding, oh, I guess I really didn't

739
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.260
earn my million dollars to be a millionaire. Um

740
00:46:55.269 --> 00:47:00.059
, for most people getting rid of the concept of

741
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.250
free will is not gonna make us like crazy and

742
00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:08.699
nihilistic. Um It's gonna be liberating. Mhm But

743
00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:13.000
uh going back just for a second to one of

744
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.989
the initial points I brought to the table when it

745
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.530
comes to the fact that we do not yet have

746
00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:23.958
a complete science of human behavior and we cannot 100%

747
00:47:23.969 --> 00:47:29.530
predict how someone will behave in a particular situation.

748
00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:35.349
Uh What if someone heard your arguments of behavioral scientist

749
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.869
and said, oh OK, Dr Sapolsky, your

750
00:47:37.878 --> 00:47:40.418
arguments are great, the science is awesome. But

751
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:45.579
since we still do not have a complete picture of

752
00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:47.949
human behavior, at least for the time being,

753
00:47:47.958 --> 00:47:53.385
I will refrain from making absolute claims, uh claims

754
00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:57.195
regarding free will. I will wait and see.

755
00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:00.324
I mean, basically what I'm asking you is do

756
00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:02.474
you think that the fact that we do not yet

757
00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:07.753
have a complete science of free will uh would make

758
00:48:07.764 --> 00:48:10.364
uh such a claim that we should reframe, refrain

759
00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:15.344
from making such absolute claims about free will uh make

760
00:48:15.353 --> 00:48:22.000
sense, right? Um Two types of answers there

761
00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:24.989
. The first one is um yeah, it's gonna

762
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.208
be so hard to subtract out thinking there's free will

763
00:48:29.219 --> 00:48:31.289
because we don't have the solid scientific facts yet.

764
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.878
For centuries, all we've done over and over is

765
00:48:35.889 --> 00:48:38.909
figure out that responsibility turns out not to have something

766
00:48:38.918 --> 00:48:44.369
to do with our behavior. Turns out hailstorms are

767
00:48:44.378 --> 00:48:47.309
not caused by witches, it turns out people who

768
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.898
have epileptic seizures are not possessed by Satan or even

769
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.438
within the last 50 years or so. It turns

770
00:48:57.449 --> 00:49:00.860
out people come down with the disease. Schizophrenia,

771
00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:07.208
not because their mothers were psycho dynamically, monsters who

772
00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:10.099
hated them. And all that happened at each one

773
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:15.128
of those points is you tell the mothers of,

774
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.329
you know, hundreds of thousands of people with schizophrenia

775
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.449
, it's not your fault. It's a neuro genetic

776
00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:25.199
disorder. All you've done is freed them all you've

777
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:29.219
done when you figured out that this kid in your

778
00:49:29.228 --> 00:49:32.679
classroom where you're a teacher just can't learn to read

779
00:49:32.688 --> 00:49:36.918
and this kid is just lazy and un mot no

780
00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.438
, there's something in their cortex that could be identified

781
00:49:39.449 --> 00:49:44.699
by scientists so that they reverse letters in their mind

782
00:49:44.739 --> 00:49:47.239
. They have dyslexia, it's not their fault.

783
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:52.010
We can't explain yet who gets dyslexia and who doesn't

784
00:49:52.019 --> 00:49:53.679
? We have only hints from prenatal environment, blah

785
00:49:53.688 --> 00:49:57.208
, blah, blah. But we know enough that

786
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.820
it is both intellectually and morally bankrupt to decide that

787
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:07.219
this child is lazy and unmotivated and to instead recognize

788
00:50:07.228 --> 00:50:12.289
we've identified their particular type of biological constraint and all

789
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.978
that's going to happen in the future is more and

790
00:50:14.989 --> 00:50:17.019
more and more of those. And all we can

791
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:21.340
be at this point is accepting that a whole lot

792
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:24.789
of things that pulls out the ugliest in us in

793
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.429
the way of judgment. We're gonna wind up saying

794
00:50:29.438 --> 00:50:30.789
, oh my God, I had no, I

795
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.989
had no idea. It had something to do with

796
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.840
that or framed a different way. Yeah. Yeah

797
00:50:36.849 --> 00:50:37.639
. Yeah, we can't sit there and say somebody

798
00:50:37.648 --> 00:50:40.719
with this sort of upbringing, we can absolutely predict

799
00:50:40.728 --> 00:50:45.478
that they're gonna wind up going to a top university

800
00:50:45.489 --> 00:50:46.559
or wind up being a multiple murderer. Yeah,

801
00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:49.679
we can't predict that yet. The science isn't good

802
00:50:49.688 --> 00:50:52.715
enough. The science is good enough on a population

803
00:50:52.724 --> 00:50:57.253
level. Any time you could look at an entire

804
00:50:57.264 --> 00:51:01.753
population and say for every increased incidence of a horrible

805
00:51:01.764 --> 00:51:07.364
childhood experience, you've just increased 35% the likelihood that

806
00:51:07.375 --> 00:51:08.994
they're going to be arrested by the time they're 20

807
00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:13.148
you got enough science. At that point, you've

808
00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:15.840
got enough science that you better know you have no

809
00:51:15.849 --> 00:51:17.800
leg to stand on. If you sit there and

810
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:22.699
say this kid this 20 year old, what can

811
00:51:22.708 --> 00:51:24.320
I say? They're just plain evil. This kid

812
00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:30.409
, if you 35% for each step, there's enough

813
00:51:30.418 --> 00:51:34.349
science at this point, there's enough knowledge there.

814
00:51:34.418 --> 00:51:37.648
If you have, I don't know whatever percent predictability

815
00:51:37.769 --> 00:51:39.969
that if your mother was drinking heavily when you're a

816
00:51:39.978 --> 00:51:45.208
fetus, you've got this likelihood of having an IQ

817
00:51:45.219 --> 00:51:49.289
below this. And someday when you're failing classes,

818
00:51:50.668 --> 00:51:52.530
we know enough science already. In all these cases

819
00:51:52.539 --> 00:51:57.250
, we know enough science because we run an entire

820
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:04.889
society on statistical guilt and statistical wonderful accomplishments. And

821
00:52:04.898 --> 00:52:07.978
we know enough now to know that those are not

822
00:52:07.989 --> 00:52:14.179
OK. So I have one last question then what

823
00:52:14.188 --> 00:52:17.110
would it take for, for someone to convince you

824
00:52:17.489 --> 00:52:24.978
that you're wrong and actually free will exists? OK

825
00:52:24.989 --> 00:52:28.958
? Here's, here's my pain in the ass response

826
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.039
. And the philosophers are going to like, oh

827
00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:35.280
come on, give me a break. Um The

828
00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:37.570
version that they start off with is oh, come

829
00:52:37.579 --> 00:52:38.719
on, give me a break is you've just done

830
00:52:38.728 --> 00:52:42.719
something, you've pulled a trigger on a gun,

831
00:52:42.728 --> 00:52:46.000
you just did something consequential And here's the muscles that

832
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:50.809
contract it. And here's the three motor neurons that

833
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.458
just sent that command. And if you wanna convince

834
00:52:53.469 --> 00:52:57.369
us that free will actually exist, show us that

835
00:52:57.378 --> 00:53:01.750
those neurons just did what they did independent of what

836
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.079
any other neuron in the brain was doing at that

837
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.539
moment. If you could do that, you've just

838
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.539
proven free will. And they say, oh come

839
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.530
on, give us a break. That's ridiculous.

840
00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:14.500
A demand. I would demand a whole lot more

841
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:17.059
than that. I would say. Show me that

842
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.909
those three neurons just told you to pull that trigger

843
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.739
, having nothing to do with what any other neuron

844
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:28.250
was whispering to it at the time and having nothing

845
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.239
to do with your hormone levels that morning and having

846
00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.918
nothing to do with your history of trauma and having

847
00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:36.639
nothing to do with your genes. So show me

848
00:53:36.648 --> 00:53:38.840
that if you had changed any of those, those

849
00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:42.128
neurons would still have done the exact same thing at

850
00:53:42.139 --> 00:53:45.760
that moment, then I'll believe in free will and

851
00:53:45.769 --> 00:53:49.728
you can't, you can't show that because nothing going

852
00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:52.860
on in you right now is anything but the outcome

853
00:53:52.869 --> 00:53:57.860
of all of that stuff that came beforehand, perhaps

854
00:53:57.869 --> 00:54:01.938
unpredictably, perhaps in some nonlinear, non additive cool

855
00:54:01.949 --> 00:54:06.159
way, perhaps in an emergent way that we can't

856
00:54:06.168 --> 00:54:08.208
even begin to mix. But that's all we are

857
00:54:08.239 --> 00:54:12.340
. Nothing more or less and show me a neuron

858
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:15.458
that just decided to do what it did independent of

859
00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:20.539
everything that came before that millisecond. And if you

860
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.128
could do that, I believe in free will and

861
00:54:23.139 --> 00:54:27.159
uh philosophers are gonna hate it. But what I

862
00:54:27.168 --> 00:54:30.610
think any biologist who knows this stuff would say is

863
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.889
, yeah, that's kind of what you need to

864
00:54:32.898 --> 00:54:37.188
show. That's kind of the proof that is needed

865
00:54:37.199 --> 00:54:40.599
to show that there really is free will and that's

866
00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:44.070
pretty damn unlikely to be able to show that.

867
00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:50.329
OK. So let's see if someone accepts the challenge

868
00:54:52.378 --> 00:54:54.989
. So, yeah, so the book is again

869
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.039
, determined a science of life without free will.

870
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.059
I'm leaving a link within the description box of this

871
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.750
interview. Um Doctor Sapolsky, just before we go

872
00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.389
apart from the book, would you like to mention

873
00:55:08.398 --> 00:55:12.829
briefly where people can find you and your work on

874
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.389
the internet? Um Let's see, I'm I am

875
00:55:16.648 --> 00:55:21.659
a medieval peasant in that. Not only don't,

876
00:55:21.668 --> 00:55:22.938
I do Facebook, I don't know how to,

877
00:55:22.949 --> 00:55:28.090
don't, not only do I not do Instagram or

878
00:55:28.099 --> 00:55:30.260
any of these things that my kids say that I

879
00:55:30.269 --> 00:55:31.760
don't understand. So I have no presence there,

880
00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:36.769
but there's a bunch of my lectures that have been

881
00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.458
put up on youtube. Um I teach a class

882
00:55:40.469 --> 00:55:45.188
at Stanford every other year on the biology of human

883
00:55:45.199 --> 00:55:47.610
social behavior. That's basically the last hour stretched out

884
00:55:47.619 --> 00:55:52.050
over entire semester. And years ago, Stanford posted

885
00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:53.750
all of those lectures up there and one of these

886
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.489
years I have to update them. So go to

887
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.728
youtube. Uh You'll see I'm doing the exact same

888
00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:04.139
ranting and raving word for word and a number of

889
00:56:04.148 --> 00:56:07.849
those like talks that overlap, but that would be

890
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.668
a good place. Ok, great. So,

891
00:56:10.679 --> 00:56:15.219
Doctor Sapolsky, thank you again for coming on the

892
