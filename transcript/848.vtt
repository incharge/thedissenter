00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.820
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:08.430
today I'm joined for a third time by Doctor

4
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.909
Robert Sapolsky. And today we're talking about his latest

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.899
book, Determined The Science of Life without free will.

6
00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.850
And I'm also leaving the links to our first

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.590
two interviews in the description of this one. So

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.229
Doctor Sapolsky, welcome back to the show. It's always

9
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.360
a pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.809
Well, likewise seeing you again and uh glad we're

11
00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.819
on the other side of the pandemic. A pleasure

12
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.529
to be here.

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.200
OK. So in our first two interviews, we talked

14
00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:43.959
a lot about the science of human behavior and

15
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.799
this time focusing on questions surrounding free will and

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.419
determinism. Are there specific aspects of the science of

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.919
human behavior that you would deem to be the

18
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.900
most important here when considering these types of questions?

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.050
Well, um just as a preamble, my, my song

20
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:11.269
and dance is that there's no free will. We

21
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:17.430
have none whatsoever. Um WHICH puts me fairly far

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.610
on the extreme of the continuum of people thinking

23
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.779
about this. Um BUT that we have no free

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.879
will at all. And this is relevant to everything

25
00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.989
about how we became, who became uh individually, all

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
of that, why you just did what you did.

27
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.639
Um But in terms of where that's most important,

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.080
um just to focus on the very narrow area,

29
00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:48.169
which is anything but narrow. Um The biggest implication

30
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.180
of that is none of us are entitled to

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.010
anything. None of us have earned to be treated

32
00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:00.510
any differently than anyone else. Of course, we may

33
00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.220
need to be treated differently. Uh Like if you're

34
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.119
uncontrollably violent, people have to be protected from you.

35
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.220
Um If you have extremely good motor skills through

36
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.449
no, you know, achievement of your own, uh Maybe

37
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.470
you're a candidate to be a good neurosurgeon, but

38
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.580
none of us have earned the right to have

39
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.660
our needs be considered more important than anyone else's.

40
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.839
And so, uh it's one thing to try to

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.169
answer the question of free will. I mean, if

42
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.410
it exists or not, but another thing is why

43
00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.449
and when people believe in free will, I mean,

44
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.110
are there specific cues that people pay attention to

45
00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.550
specific variables that play a role in how much

46
00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.630
free will people attribute to themselves or to someone

47
00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.389
else when evaluating a particular action?

48
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.559
Well, you're right and people almost universally uh believe

49
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.380
that they are the agents of their action. Um

50
00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.119
Like 90% of philosophers fall into a camp uh

51
00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.929
called compatible list views of free will. These are

52
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.389
people, they're not saying there's magic, they're not taking

53
00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.360
theological stances, whatever they say. Yeah, the world is

54
00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.559
made of atoms, we're made of cells like we

55
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.300
believe in all that stuff. Yet, somehow here's how

56
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.919
free will still like pops out of your brain

57
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.020
and do a lot of hand waving at that

58
00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.259
point. Um So it's incredibly common view. Um Like

59
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.699
all of our other features of our beliefs and

60
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.889
temperaments, um It's kind of context dependent people really,

61
00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.580
really are more likely to believe in free will

62
00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.899
if someone's complimenting them and saying good job, they're

63
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.589
really looking like to like, likely to under circumstances

64
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.949
where things have come up short. I mean, there's,

65
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.289
there's this classic dichotomy and sort of us, them

66
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.589
thinking that with them, when thems do something awful,

67
00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.109
it's constitutional. That's what they're like. They've always been

68
00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:26.130
like, they'll always be like, and when one of

69
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.929
us does something awful, it's situational. Yeah, you have

70
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.890
to understand they were under a lot of stress,

71
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.579
there were financial pressures, they had just been whatever,

72
00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:41.559
um, as to how stable our us this is

73
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.100
and we're often being pretty nasty when we're attributing

74
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.070
unchangeable them ness to them. Um, IN that regard,

75
00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.670
we're very, very malleable when it comes to how

76
00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:00.149
characteristically free we are. When things are going well,

77
00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:04.570
people believe in free will when things are not,

78
00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.010
there's a tendency to go in the other direction

79
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.790
but not in a globalized. There's no free will

80
00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:15.109
whatsoever. Here's the extenuating circumstance that screwed me up

81
00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:18.730
just now that kept me from being the wondrous

82
00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:23.160
free, consistent person that I am. Yeah, something came

83
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.769
up. But overall, overall we are the captains of

84
00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.679
our fate. Mhm

85
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.489
But uh let me ask you about one criticism

86
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.970
that perhaps many people, scientists particularly would have of

87
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.850
uh your position. So we have a, a good

88
00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:48.100
understanding or at least to some extent of the

89
00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:50.850
science of human behavior, the factors that play a

90
00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:55.010
role there uh from genetics to the environment and

91
00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:59.119
culture. But uh I mean, there's still lots and

92
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.600
lots of details that we are missing. And it's

93
00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:07.649
really hard to be able to predict with a

94
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.200
very high level of accuracy how people will behave

95
00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:16.799
in any particular point in time. So, the fact

96
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:21.320
that there's still fairly low predictability, do you think

97
00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:25.359
that that's an argument against your position?

98
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.019
Um No, and that's, that's like a fantastic counter

99
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.000
ment to bring up because it's very essential. It,

100
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.899
it obviously is very essential. Um Like I, I

101
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.500
have sort of a hobby by now that I

102
00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.700
uh help uh public defenders uh who are lawyers

103
00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.170
defending poor people who can't afford uh their own

104
00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:53.799
lawyers in murder cases for people who have a

105
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:58.809
history of traumatic childhoods, uh concussive head trauma and

106
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.339
such teaching juries about the brain. And what always

107
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.739
happens is I get to do a two hour

108
00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:09.070
presentation and then the prosecuting attorney gets to cross

109
00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.640
examine me and they always nail me on exactly

110
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.859
these lines. So, are you saying every single person

111
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:19.720
with this type of brain damage would do what

112
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.230
this guy did? I'd say, no, we can't say

113
00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:26.709
that. Could you have predicted this guy? No, we

114
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.739
can't. Um Part of it, a fundamentally deep response

115
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:39.140
is um when you look at uh chaotic systems,

116
00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:43.269
systems that run on chaotic system, like us, our

117
00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:48.160
brains, our cells, our molecules, our societies, um a

118
00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:53.209
critical thing about them is they are unpredictable. They're

119
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.149
still deterministic and lots of people mistake sort of

120
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.500
chaotic and the unpredictability of it as proof that

121
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.500
somehow we could transcend our molecules. But on that

122
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.019
level, in this very fundamental way, um systems that

123
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:14.859
are entirely deterministic can nonetheless be completely unpredictable. A

124
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:19.019
much more mundane answer is, well, yeah, we're still

125
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:22.750
finding out stuff. And when you look at our

126
00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:26.700
knowledge about sort of the biology of human behavior,

127
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.299
like 99% of what we've learned about it has

128
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:34.460
been in the last century, 75% has been in

129
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:38.340
the last 50 years, 51% has been in the

130
00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.058
last decade, 25% of it has been since like

131
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.989
we started this broadcast or whatever, like the rate

132
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.799
at which knowledge is pouring in is incredibly fast.

133
00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:53.440
So there, there's this sort of indirect cheating strategy

134
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.820
that one can then say, which is OK if

135
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.419
we're all going to accept that tonight. At midnight.

136
00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:03.729
That's it. Science is done. We're never gonna find

137
00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:05.909
out anything new again. This is everything we know

138
00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:08.380
at this point. The answer is, yeah. Nonetheless, we

139
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.320
can't predict a whole lot about human behavior. Um

140
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.489
But everything we know about the exponential increase in

141
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.270
knowledge is over and over and over, we're gonna

142
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.200
continue this pattern of saying, oh, I had no

143
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.580
idea. Biology had something to do with that. And

144
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.690
like you have a choice at this point, do

145
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.770
you wanna be on the cutting edge of viewing

146
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.020
that we are nothing more or less than biological

147
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.919
machines or do you wanna be like the history

148
00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:41.919
of science example in a century of just the

149
00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:45.309
primitiveness of what people still believed at the time.

150
00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:51.179
And so one of the things uh also that

151
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.039
people bring to the table in discussions surrounding free

152
00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:58.479
will and that people use in law and in

153
00:09:58.489 --> 00:10:03.909
the courtroom has to do with intent. So, from

154
00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:08.840
a scientific perspective, what is intent exactly? And what

155
00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:11.229
do we know about it? And do you think

156
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:16.200
that its intent in any way would make for

157
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.190
a good case for free will in any way?

158
00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:25.140
Yes. Let me, let me just be really uh

159
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.820
sort of over the top here. Um As a

160
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.419
scientist, my definition of intent as a subject to

161
00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:36.219
consider when thinking about free will. Um INTENT can

162
00:10:36.229 --> 00:10:40.380
be defined as boring as hell and totally irrelevant.

163
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.880
Um OK. Why is that? Um THE entire legal

164
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.929
system, as you said, runs on that. Um, WHEN

165
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.340
somebody did something awful, did they intend to do

166
00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:54.330
it? And did they know that they had alternative

167
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.059
options? Um And did they understand what the consequences

168
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.390
were going to be? Um And if the answer

169
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.750
to all of that is? Yeah, lock them up.

170
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.789
They intended to do what they did and they

171
00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:11.349
knew there were alternatives. Um And in sort of

172
00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:15.979
the neuroscience world of free will where intent comes

173
00:11:15.989 --> 00:11:20.299
in is the most influential crazy making experiment of

174
00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:22.369
all time in the field. This is something that

175
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.900
came in the early 19 eighties by a man

176
00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:29.130
named Benjamin Lit. And you read any paper about

177
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.880
the biology of free will and like the person

178
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.609
is almost required by law to mention lit by

179
00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:38.580
the second paragraph, these were these amazing studies. He

180
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.799
took people and wired them up with sort of

181
00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:46.400
electroencephalograms, eegs to record brain activity in different areas.

182
00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:50.070
This was like Neanderthal era technology at the time,

183
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.640
you couldn't do brain imaging then. But this very

184
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:58.530
simple approach. Um HE said to people, OK, whenever

185
00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:02.090
you want, press this button and they had things

186
00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:06.159
to tell when the pressing process actually started by

187
00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:10.549
seeing when muscles started constricting in his arm. And

188
00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:12.690
they could see what was happening in the motor

189
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.830
cortex, the part of the brain telling those muscles

190
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.489
and they could see the parts of the brain

191
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.070
that would tell another part to tell another part

192
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.200
to tell the motor cortex to do that. And

193
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.309
the earth shattering finding that he came up with

194
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.679
was all of this playing out in about a

195
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.570
half second or so. You could tell when the

196
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.400
brain had decided it was time to press the

197
00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:41.159
button because before the person was conscious of their

198
00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:46.020
intention to do it by about 200 milliseconds, 2/10

199
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.359
of a second. And oh my God, your brain

200
00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:54.239
has decided before you were conscious of intending to

201
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.250
do this. And everyone like went crazy over this

202
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.479
because this is just proven there was no free

203
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:06.929
will until like people started arguing about. When do

204
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.010
you become aware of intention? And is that different

205
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.400
from when you intend to do something? And, and

206
00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:16.349
you know, all this philosophical stuff of, is there

207
00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:20.109
a difference between intending to do something and intending

208
00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:23.409
to stop yourself from doing something? The difference between

209
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:26.770
free will and free won't? And they're still fighting

210
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.460
about this. This is 40 years later for a

211
00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:32.119
scientist, there was like a paper a couple of

212
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.309
years ago entitled like Livid. Had no idea what

213
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.669
he was talking about or, or something slightly more

214
00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:42.909
like formal than that for people to still be

215
00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.690
telling you that your science was wrong 40 years

216
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.530
after you did it, this is like immortality for

217
00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:52.479
a scientist. They're still fighting about what this finding

218
00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:57.239
means. Does your brain know that you're intending to

219
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.900
do something before you're consciously aware of it. And

220
00:14:00.909 --> 00:14:04.130
I scream every time I see yet another one

221
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.760
of these studies because as I said, it's boring

222
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.880
as hell and totally irrelevant. And in a courtroom

223
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.150
as well, did this person intend to do that?

224
00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:17.140
Because none of it asks the only relevant question

225
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.179
there is. Oh, yeah. Where did that intent come

226
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.409
from? Where did it come from in the first

227
00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:28.630
place? Because to answer the question of, did the

228
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.390
brain have intent before you did that's playing out

229
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.869
in 2/10 of a second when you're asking, where

230
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.489
did that intent come from? What does that have

231
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.030
to do with what was going on in your

232
00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:44.890
brain one second ago? And what was happening in

233
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.539
the environment one minute ago? And what hormone levels

234
00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:51.979
were like one day ago and how traumatic or

235
00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:55.299
stimulating the previous one year had been and what

236
00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:57.830
your adolescence was like in your childhood and your

237
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.090
fetal life and your genes and the culture your

238
00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:05.330
ancestors invented because that influenced how your mother was

239
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.049
raising you within a minute of birth. Where did

240
00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:11.109
that intent come from? And the metaphor I use

241
00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:14.320
in the book is deciding whether or not there's

242
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.719
free will based on what's going on in that

243
00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:21.320
last half second and only knowing what the intent

244
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.479
was is like deciding whether you like a movie

245
00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:26.760
or not by just having seen the final three

246
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.340
minutes of it because you've missed everything. It doesn't

247
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:34.130
matter if the person intended to or not. Where

248
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.340
did that intent come from? And that's where the

249
00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:42.739
legal system falls apart in terms of their thinking

250
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.400
about, you know, punishment and blame. And that's where

251
00:15:47.409 --> 00:15:50.239
most thinking about whether or not there's free will

252
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.929
falls apart because everybody is just interested in their

253
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.400
brain imaging studies telling you what happened in the

254
00:15:55.409 --> 00:16:00.080
last three milliseconds. And that tells you nothing because

255
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.849
something about what happened to you this morning had

256
00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:06.840
something to do with it. Something about your fetal

257
00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:09.909
life had something to do with it. Something about

258
00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:13.770
the culture, your answer came up with 500 years

259
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.080
ago, had something to do with it. And when

260
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.900
you look at all those pieces from one second

261
00:16:18.909 --> 00:16:21.619
before to millennia before and you put all those

262
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.250
pieces together, there's not a damn inch in there

263
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.090
to shoehorn in an ocean of free will operating

264
00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:31.090
independent of all of that stuff.

265
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:37.070
Mhm So when it comes to behavioral science, we

266
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.270
always hear about nature versus nurture genes, the environment

267
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.030
does when it comes to free will specifically, does

268
00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:52.289
it matter at all if uh we're talking about

269
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:57.599
uh for example, biological factors or environmental factors? I

270
00:16:57.609 --> 00:17:01.650
mean, do we have any more control, for example,

271
00:17:01.659 --> 00:17:06.290
over our environment and how it affects our behavior

272
00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:10.140
than we have over our gyms, for

273
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:16.199
example, zero in both cases in the fundamental ways.

274
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:18.020
I mean, what one is obliged to do in

275
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.310
my business at this point is saying, nature and

276
00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.420
nurture always interact and you can't pull them apart

277
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.689
and asking which contributes more is like what's contributing

278
00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:32.489
more to the area of this rectangle, the length

279
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.760
or the width they always interact and that sort

280
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.109
of thing um within this realm. Um The summary

281
00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:43.030
I would get at is we are nothing more

282
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.069
or less than the sum of our biology, which

283
00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:50.550
we had no control over and its interactions with

284
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.579
the sum of our environment over which we had

285
00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:58.250
no control over. And they're completely inseparable. I mean,

286
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.989
it's the simplest example of like, oh, how important

287
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.109
was environment in this sort of case and its

288
00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:08.140
interaction with biology? Wow, what explains the fact that

289
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:13.930
I'm sitting here right now and have a occupation

290
00:18:13.939 --> 00:18:16.880
that carries some prestige and westernized culture and all

291
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.189
of that, what did environment have to do with

292
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:22.939
it? Starting with environment prenatal environment. The fact that

293
00:18:22.949 --> 00:18:27.869
my, my mother was not suffering from malaria or

294
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.619
Chagas disease or like any such thing and wasn't

295
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.819
protein starved because she was a nomadic pastoralist in

296
00:18:35.829 --> 00:18:39.260
the Sahel, in Africa. And like, oh, like we're

297
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.709
talking like at that level already. That's like what

298
00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:47.209
we're talking already at that level. That's part of

299
00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:51.180
the brain that you wound up being uh handed

300
00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:54.359
to you here in adulthood. Um All of that

301
00:18:54.369 --> 00:18:57.660
stuff matters and it's inseparable.

302
00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:02.439
Mhm One very interesting thing that you talk about

303
00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:06.939
in the book is the Behavioral Science slash Biology

304
00:19:06.949 --> 00:19:10.400
of luck. What is that about

305
00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:17.160
it? It's, that's ultimately everything, everything we're talking about

306
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.660
here. Um Another way of saying, oh, the sum

307
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.680
of our biology and this interaction with the sum

308
00:19:23.689 --> 00:19:26.199
of our environment is we are nothing more or

309
00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:30.510
less than the outcome of our luck and anyone

310
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:36.829
who claims otherwise that they earned their good luck

311
00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:39.130
or that it makes sense to punish them for

312
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.060
their bad luck. Um All we are is the

313
00:19:44.069 --> 00:19:48.229
outcome of biology, interacting with environment in the context

314
00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:51.109
of luck. And there's this whole thing like child

315
00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:55.050
development, um try to make sense of who turns

316
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.800
out to be like the the violent adults and

317
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.339
the drug addicts and all the, all the bad

318
00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:06.689
outcomes and like no surprise childhood has a huge

319
00:20:06.699 --> 00:20:10.160
amount to do with it and it's been formalized

320
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.180
into this thing. Um At least in sort of

321
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:17.439
uh United States called your ace score A ce

322
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.819
the sum of your adverse childhood experiences. And there's

323
00:20:22.829 --> 00:20:27.640
this ace like questionnaire scoring system where you can

324
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.979
get from 0 to 10 and zero is you

325
00:20:30.989 --> 00:20:34.219
had no adversity 10 is like you had all

326
00:20:34.229 --> 00:20:37.329
of the following 10 horrible things happen to you.

327
00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:43.199
Were you a witness to physical violence or psychological

328
00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:47.640
violence at home? Were you a victim of physical

329
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.250
violence or psychological violence? Were you a victim of

330
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.810
sexual abuse? Were you in a broken family? Was

331
00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:57.500
there a weapon at home when you was there,

332
00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.520
a family member who was incarcerated this whole list

333
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.069
there going from 0 to 10. Um, AND what

334
00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:08.150
you see is for every single step, every point

335
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.689
you add to somebody's ace score. Um, THERE'S about

336
00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:16.560
a 35% increased likelihood that they're going to be

337
00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:20.520
involved in violent antisocial behavior by the time they're

338
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.420
adult. If they're a male, there's about a 35%

339
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.229
increased chance that they're gonna have a teenage pregnancy.

340
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.750
If they're female, about a 35% increased chance of

341
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.030
either that they're gonna have substance abuse and addiction

342
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.209
problems every step in the way. And this is

343
00:21:38.219 --> 00:21:42.489
one way of formalizing like this is the quantified

344
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.469
science of shitty luck in childhood. And it has

345
00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:48.949
always struck me that at the same time. Instead

346
00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:53.800
of making it an adverse childhood experience score, you

347
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:59.369
could make a ridiculously lucky childhood experience score. Did

348
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.250
your parent or parents read books to you? Did

349
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.489
you have a stable income? Um Did you never

350
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.290
have to worry about food? Did you play games

351
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.680
and laugh at home? Whatever? Come up with a

352
00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:15.609
score of that and it's gonna tell you forever.

353
00:22:15.689 --> 00:22:19.040
Each step in those, there's a 35% increase that

354
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:23.550
you're gonna be working a prestigious white collar job

355
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.949
someday and have an office and a secretary or

356
00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:29.989
who knows just a different way of explaining the

357
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.869
same thing. Um Everything that we frame as morality

358
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.819
is instead the outcome or of good or bad

359
00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:44.599
luck. And we have built a world in which

360
00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:48.739
we punish or reward people over the luck they

361
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.979
had nothing to do with.

362
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:56.160
Mhm. But, uh, as we go through, uh childhood

363
00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:02.709
adolescence, adulthood and our prefrontal cortices develop, we tend

364
00:23:02.719 --> 00:23:08.280
to gain or acquire more self-control, more impulse control.

365
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.880
Does that not count at least as a few

366
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.119
more degrees of rhythm?

367
00:23:15.739 --> 00:23:18.630
Right. Let's look at the sentence you just said

368
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.689
as we get older, don't we acquire more frontal

369
00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:28.020
cortical self control? What does acquire mean? It means

370
00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:31.030
you're lucky enough to be in an environment that

371
00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.089
would have taught you that it means you're lucky

372
00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:36.890
enough to have a brain at that point where

373
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.810
you could learn from those experiences. It means that

374
00:23:39.819 --> 00:23:43.099
you're lucky enough that the counter examples every day

375
00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:45.829
when you finish school and went outside and there

376
00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:48.979
was the, your gang telling you let's go rob

377
00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:52.969
that liquor store. Um Let's do something impulsive that

378
00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:57.010
reinforces your frontal cortex not working very well. How

379
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.030
many of those were going on at the end

380
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.089
of the day? Do you go home and you're

381
00:24:01.099 --> 00:24:04.430
bullied by somebody at home and anything you heard

382
00:24:04.439 --> 00:24:07.719
during the day about like the wonderful path ahead

383
00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:10.569
of you? Thanks to self control goes out the

384
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:16.099
window. Be Yeah, we learned. Oh, wow. Didn't you

385
00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:18.560
learn somewhere along the way that self control is

386
00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:21.939
a bad thing for you if you're a fetus

387
00:24:21.949 --> 00:24:25.479
and your mother is very stressed and secreting a

388
00:24:25.489 --> 00:24:28.439
lot of stress hormones. You're going to be born

389
00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:31.810
with a frontal cortex that's already less developed than

390
00:24:31.819 --> 00:24:36.114
average and newborns. Meaning 15 years later, you're getting

391
00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:39.055
great lessons in life about the importance of self

392
00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:41.104
control. And by the time you were a damn

393
00:24:41.114 --> 00:24:45.915
fetus, you were already less likely than average to

394
00:24:45.925 --> 00:24:48.765
be able to learn those lessons and benefit from

395
00:24:48.775 --> 00:24:52.435
them every step along the way. Where did that

396
00:24:52.444 --> 00:24:55.244
intent come from? Where did that learning come from?

397
00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:58.094
Where did the opportunity for that learning come from?

398
00:24:58.489 --> 00:25:02.589
And it's always, you know, all that stuff that

399
00:25:02.599 --> 00:25:04.670
brought you to this moment over which you had

400
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.430
no control.

401
00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:11.680
And when it comes to our psychological traits, we

402
00:25:11.689 --> 00:25:15.949
know, for example, from disciplines like behavior genetics that

403
00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:19.449
there's the role of genes and then the shared

404
00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:23.920
environment, the non shared environment, unique experiences we go

405
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.290
through. Isn't there any space at all there for

406
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.130
some, uh I mean, for us to have some

407
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.630
sort of be, be able to play some active

408
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.410
role in the kind of person that we're going

409
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.290
to become?

410
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.150
Absolutely. Um And that's one of the ways in

411
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.670
which uh people should avoid the hysteria of deciding

412
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.709
genes, determine everything that genes are the most interesting

413
00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.939
things. If nothing else, you have this whole field

414
00:25:56.949 --> 00:26:01.770
of epigenetics, the ways in which experience can change

415
00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.709
how readily genes of yours are turned on or

416
00:26:04.719 --> 00:26:06.380
off. For the rest of your life in some

417
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.250
cases. OK. So we're moved away from a genetic

418
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.239
deterministic picture for a zillion reasons, uh both biological

419
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.729
and environmental. Um But you're saying, can't we choose

420
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.689
to take an action to take a conscious action

421
00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:27.119
which will change our destiny? And the answer is

422
00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:30.479
not in the slightest, you look at two people

423
00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:33.880
who were given an opportunity and one is this

424
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.599
person who every single split in the road, they

425
00:26:38.609 --> 00:26:42.239
always take the wrong direction. They never miss an

426
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.550
opportunity to miss an opportunity at everyone. You could

427
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.439
have. They, they would have given you that job.

428
00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:53.439
They were offering you a scholarship. The guy said

429
00:26:53.449 --> 00:26:55.400
you didn't have to drive the car when they

430
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.030
were going to do the robbery and oh my

431
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.640
God, every time that person makes the wrong choice,

432
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:06.189
every time they come up with the wrong intent

433
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.810
and where did that come from? And when we

434
00:27:09.819 --> 00:27:15.890
seemingly have made a major decision on our part

435
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.959
about something in life, are you going to rob

436
00:27:20.969 --> 00:27:23.959
the store? Are you going to study hard? Are

437
00:27:23.969 --> 00:27:26.560
you gonna propose marriage to this person or you?

438
00:27:26.569 --> 00:27:32.010
Who knows what? Um And that feels intent. Um

439
00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:35.310
Everything about the biology and this interaction with the

440
00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:38.780
environment that came before that is what brought you

441
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:44.579
to that moment. Like from everything. Like if you're

442
00:27:44.589 --> 00:27:49.300
hungry, you're more likely to commit an antisocial violent

443
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:55.189
act. If somebody smells good to you, their pheromones,

444
00:27:55.199 --> 00:27:58.030
you're more likely to find them. You claim that

445
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.380
they are more vis visually physically attractive if you,

446
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:06.449
you know all this stuff, what, what this, at

447
00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:07.989
the split in the road? Do you make the

448
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.119
right decision or not? What this taps into is?

449
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.939
I think the most pernicious way in which people

450
00:28:15.949 --> 00:28:18.939
hold on to. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's biology

451
00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:20.390
and we have brains and all of that and

452
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.839
it just made a brain gunk. Um, BUT we

453
00:28:22.849 --> 00:28:25.260
have free will, we have free will. Is this

454
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:30.910
dichotomy people bring in? You look at somebody who's

455
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.170
7 ft four and of course, they're a great

456
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.540
basketball player or you look at somebody and they

457
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:42.439
have particular ratio of slow twitch to fast twitch

458
00:28:42.449 --> 00:28:45.459
fibers in their leg muscles and of course they

459
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:48.449
turn out to be a good marathoner or maybe

460
00:28:48.459 --> 00:28:52.459
even you understand enough about receptors for this or

461
00:28:52.469 --> 00:28:55.560
that neurotransmitter. And of course they have a good

462
00:28:55.569 --> 00:29:00.010
memory or good. Any of these. We're pretty good

463
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.250
at accepting the biology of what our natural attributes

464
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.160
are. Some people have lovely voices and others don't.

465
00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.489
And they're never gonna sing in an opera. Some

466
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.150
people have, yes, there's these natural attributes. OK. Ok.

467
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.949
Ok. Science biology has something to do with that.

468
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.780
But oh, where free will comes in is what

469
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:27.589
you do with your attributes? Do you squander them?

470
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.180
Do you work hard to overcome your limitations? Do

471
00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:33.239
you, are you one of these people like you

472
00:29:33.339 --> 00:29:36.209
go on youtube and there's unbelievable examples of this,

473
00:29:36.219 --> 00:29:40.719
of like marathoners and like important races where they

474
00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:44.839
collapse 53 ft from the finish line and they

475
00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:48.300
crawl, they crawl to the very end. And you

476
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.459
say, oh my God, this is amazing with what

477
00:29:52.469 --> 00:29:54.800
they did with what they were given. Or you

478
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.719
find like somebody raised in poverty in a horrible

479
00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.199
neighborhood and all of that who somehow winds up

480
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.180
like with their Nobel Prize at the other end,

481
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:06.739
or somebody who grows up in great wealth and

482
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.979
privilege and they're a junkie by the time they're

483
00:30:09.989 --> 00:30:15.040
20 they've spent half their fortune. Oh, your attributes

484
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.300
you have no control over. That's the biology. What

485
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.349
do you do with the attributes? That's where we

486
00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:25.089
have a world of, oh, what a self indulgent

487
00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:29.829
squander. What an inspiring role model, how they worked

488
00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:34.859
to overcome. There's something in there that we believe

489
00:30:34.869 --> 00:30:38.310
that things like your memory or whether you have

490
00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:40.780
perfect pitch or things like that are made of

491
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.650
biology and how hard you work and your self

492
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.800
control and how indulgent you are and all of

493
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.839
that somehow that's made of other stuff that's not

494
00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:55.800
made of biology. And when you look at it

495
00:30:55.849 --> 00:30:58.719
like what happened to you as a fetus is

496
00:30:58.729 --> 00:31:01.030
going to have something to do with the construction

497
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.359
of your part of the brain that has something

498
00:31:03.369 --> 00:31:06.250
to do with whether it splits in the road,

499
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.869
you always make the bad decision, you every step

500
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.520
of this is biology as well. Um But there's

501
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:21.099
this very strong emotional pull to differentiate between the

502
00:31:21.109 --> 00:31:27.920
two and willpower and backbone and fortitude and all

503
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.160
of that, that's the stuff we admire because that's

504
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.859
the true measure of who somebody is independent of

505
00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:37.469
their neurons and molecules of it's made of the

506
00:31:37.479 --> 00:31:38.599
same stuff.

507
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.910
And so um is there any space for an

508
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:51.010
idea like meritocracy in this sort of deterministic world?

509
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.589
I mean, if someone just so happens to have

510
00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:58.510
the psychological traits that tend to correlate with success,

511
00:31:58.729 --> 00:32:05.640
for example, in industrialized societies, like greed, conscientiousness, high

512
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.680
intelligence and so on. Should we at from, from

513
00:32:09.689 --> 00:32:12.640
a scientific perspective? Of course, I'm not talking about

514
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:16.290
uh philosophy, a philosophical perspective nor any of that.

515
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.180
Does it make sense to attribute any personal merit

516
00:32:20.189 --> 00:32:20.739
to them?

517
00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:31.250
Yeah. Um The only possible, scientifically acceptable and morally

518
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.030
acceptable conclusion from all of this is there's no

519
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:42.060
circumstance in which blame and punishment make moral sense

520
00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:47.260
or are uh are good things in and of

521
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:51.520
themselves. And likewise, there's no circumstance in which praise

522
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.579
and reward are virtues in and of themselves because

523
00:32:55.589 --> 00:32:57.920
nobody earned one or the other, that sort of

524
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.739
thing. This comes with two provisos though um the

525
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:08.290
first one is like every now and then it's

526
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.680
useful to punish someone because it changes their behavior

527
00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:14.489
in an effective way or it's useful to praise

528
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:20.479
somebody because in an instrumental sense. Um Praise and

529
00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:23.300
blame could be useful, not because of what somebody

530
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.180
did in the past that this is retribute but

531
00:33:26.189 --> 00:33:29.380
for shaping their future behavior just in like a

532
00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.280
psychological engineering kind of way. Um So that's not

533
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.469
saying it's not possible, it's never useful, but just

534
00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:42.719
as another way of influence the influencing the biological

535
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:47.979
machine. Um The more fundamental level is when you

536
00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:52.689
say crazy stuff like I just did to people

537
00:33:52.709 --> 00:33:57.290
they say, oh, so you want just murderers running

538
00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.890
around the streets or? Oh, you just want it

539
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.500
randomly picked who's going to do brain surgery to

540
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.929
take out your tumor. No, of course not. Even

541
00:34:08.938 --> 00:34:11.820
if you get rid of the entire criminal justice

542
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.820
system as it now appears. And as we should,

543
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.860
because it's built on biological nonsense of the most

544
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:24.699
destructive kind. Nonetheless, people who are uncontrollably dangerous and

545
00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:27.899
violent where you can't fix them, you gotta protect

546
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:32.188
people from them. Um, A car whose brakes don't

547
00:34:32.197 --> 00:34:34.589
work. You don't let it out on the street,

548
00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:36.789
you put it in the garage and you like,

549
00:34:36.799 --> 00:34:40.928
don't drive it, but you don't preach to either

550
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.217
that violent person or to the car whose brakes

551
00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:47.768
don't work that they have a crummy rotten soul

552
00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:49.868
and they don't deserve to be able to do

553
00:34:49.878 --> 00:34:53.489
this and what you have to do instead is

554
00:34:53.498 --> 00:34:56.259
use a term that's more and more in like

555
00:34:56.268 --> 00:34:59.229
this. People thinking this way is they have to

556
00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:03.850
be quarantined, quarantine them so that they're not dangerous

557
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.629
to anyone and not an inch more. And not

558
00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:09.510
because there's anything about it that they deserve the

559
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.229
brakes don't work on their car and then the

560
00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:15.100
flip side is exactly the same. Oh, my God.

561
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.489
So, what, we should just have a random lottery

562
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:23.149
as to who, who, like, does brain surgery on

563
00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:26.149
you. No, of course not. Just as you can't

564
00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:29.770
have dangerous people on the street, You need the

565
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.439
most competent people out there doing the medicine, doing

566
00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:38.860
the legal stuff, writing whatever it is that takes

567
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:45.540
um skill that matters, that's really important. But you

568
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.570
just the same, you can't sit there and tell

569
00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.790
that person because they have a wonderful soul or

570
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.560
a wonderful self discipline or whatever that they deserve

571
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.820
to have this ridiculously large income. Like a world

572
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.790
built around blaming people for their antisocial behavior makes

573
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.040
no sense. And a world built around rewarding people

574
00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.429
for their prosocial behavior or their expertise makes no

575
00:36:11.439 --> 00:36:17.419
sense either. Um And is ultimately just as morally

576
00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:22.729
corrupt because if you say you are a brain

577
00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:28.219
surgeon and getting enormous societal prestige because you did

578
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:31.340
something where you earned it, you deserve to do

579
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.040
that and be in that position makes as little

580
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.080
sense biologically as saying the brain, the uh the

581
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.360
murderer with a history of frontal cortical damage deserves

582
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.110
to be in prison all of that. Um Yeah,

583
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.959
it's the flip side. A meritocracy makes no sense.

584
00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:52.790
A justice system built around retribution makes no sense

585
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.040
either. But at the same time, dangerous people should

586
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.389
not be allowed to damage people. And competent people

587
00:36:59.399 --> 00:37:01.639
should be more likely to be running the world

588
00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:05.310
than less competent people. But no one should feel

589
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.189
shame or pride for which end of those Katina

590
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.500
they wind up on.

591
00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:18.239
But even if there's not really space for blame

592
00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.860
or praise or to consider or to think that

593
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:26.260
someone is responsible for their own actions, do you

594
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.120
think that it would still make sense to talk

595
00:37:29.129 --> 00:37:34.669
about punishment? At least as a deterrence measure or

596
00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:39.679
for example, blaming or praising someone just because we

597
00:37:39.689 --> 00:37:43.879
know scientifically that if we do that, we would

598
00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:50.419
be disincentivizing bad behavior, incentivizing good behavior and conditioning

599
00:37:50.429 --> 00:37:54.409
people to behave in better ways.

600
00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.439
Absolutely. And it's the same biology that like you

601
00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:04.199
take a, a sea snail and it could learn

602
00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:06.209
that when you like bop it on the head

603
00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:10.429
with a pencil, it retracts its gill mechanism or

604
00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:15.340
some. Yeah, you can shape sea snails behavior, you

605
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.790
could shape human behavior, you could shape human behavior

606
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.820
to be more or less adaptive, blah, blah, all

607
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:24.524
of that. And yeah. Yeah, sometimes it requires punishment

608
00:38:24.534 --> 00:38:28.544
and sometimes it requires praise and reward. Um But

609
00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:33.425
just because that's like another thing you can do,

610
00:38:33.554 --> 00:38:38.725
sometimes intervene with somebody who's got problems and make

611
00:38:38.735 --> 00:38:42.544
sure they uh they get enough calories in their

612
00:38:42.554 --> 00:38:46.469
diet and things will go better sometimes like you

613
00:38:46.479 --> 00:38:48.510
hit someone over the head and say they, they

614
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.399
can't do this anymore and they'll stop doing some

615
00:38:51.409 --> 00:38:55.989
rotten behavior. Yes. But never with a sense that

616
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.110
you are doing a moral good because that's completely

617
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.659
irrelevant. It's just another realm in which we as

618
00:39:04.669 --> 00:39:08.699
biological machines can be shaped in our behavior.

619
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.469
And what do you think about, uh, the idea

620
00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:18.040
that some people put forth that, uh, ok, even

621
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:21.949
if we know that free will does not exist

622
00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:24.199
that it doesn't make sense to talk about free

623
00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:28.770
will. People should still believe in free will because

624
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:34.030
if they don't, they will be worse people. I

625
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.340
mean, do you, or do you think on the

626
00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:41.260
other hand that, uh, telling people that, uh, they

627
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:45.580
should abandon their belief in free will would actually

628
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.250
improve their lives?

629
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.179
Ok. This is, this is ultimately like the most

630
00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:54.489
important question to ask whether or not we have

631
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.620
free will. Should we all believe that we do?

632
00:39:56.889 --> 00:40:00.969
Um, ONE worry which you bring up is if

633
00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:03.260
we stop believing in free will, we're all gonna

634
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.679
become murderers and cheats and liars and we will

635
00:40:06.689 --> 00:40:10.294
run amok. Um And this is the thing people

636
00:40:10.304 --> 00:40:14.945
worry about, uh, most instantly and there's a cruel

637
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:19.965
experimental psychology literature showing that if you take like

638
00:40:19.975 --> 00:40:24.885
volunteer test subjects and you manipulate them into feeling

639
00:40:24.895 --> 00:40:27.504
like there is less free will than they thought

640
00:40:27.514 --> 00:40:30.764
there was 10 minutes later, they're more likely to

641
00:40:30.774 --> 00:40:33.715
cheat on a test, they're more likely to do

642
00:40:33.725 --> 00:40:36.584
something crummy to somebody else. When they're playing a

643
00:40:36.594 --> 00:40:42.199
game, morality and ethical behavior goes down. That's it.

644
00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:46.030
That's exactly what, like the problem is when you

645
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.360
tell people, um, like you can't be held responsible

646
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.719
for anything. They've run amok. Just like if you

647
00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:56.580
convince someone that there is no God and thus

648
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.850
there's no punishment, they run amok also. And then

649
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.550
you look closer at it and because there's this

650
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.729
parallel literature, you have test subjects and you convince

651
00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:13.250
them, manipulate them into believing, lesson God and right

652
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.669
afterward, they cheat more and they do the same

653
00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:19.000
crummy stuff. But now you do a different version

654
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.870
of these studies, get someone who comes in and

655
00:41:22.879 --> 00:41:25.510
says, I haven't believed in free will for 10

656
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.419
years or I haven't believed in God since I

657
00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:33.280
was a teenager or any. You get people who

658
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.290
have thought that way and felt that way for

659
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.800
a long time who got there. Not because some

660
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.030
like psychology professor is manipulating them in this environment.

661
00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:46.780
But you get people like that who've thought through

662
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.659
this for a long time. And they are exactly

663
00:41:50.669 --> 00:41:54.590
as moral as the most religious people and the

664
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.929
people with the strongest sense of belief in free

665
00:41:56.939 --> 00:42:02.070
will. And this fascinates me, like in terms of

666
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.620
the God issue, you look at people who very,

667
00:42:05.629 --> 00:42:10.020
very strongly believe in God and the whole show

668
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.709
that goes along with that or very, very strongly

669
00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:15.290
believes there is no God. And as I said,

670
00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.949
there's no difference in their levels of ethical behavior

671
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.840
and it's very high in both cases who are

672
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.239
the ones who are less ethical, the ones who

673
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.590
are in between, the ones who say, oh, I

674
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.870
don't know, I guess there's God and like, I

675
00:42:31.879 --> 00:42:34.300
make sure the kids learn something about it because

676
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.510
it's good for them and like, the, the ho

677
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.969
are good or say God, I don't, I don't

678
00:42:39.979 --> 00:42:42.459
actually care. Maybe there's not a God, but it's

679
00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:44.040
like, what does it have to do with me?

680
00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:50.350
The people who are like indifferently religious or apathetically

681
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.260
atheistic, the ones in the middle, those are the

682
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.770
ones who you readily manipulate their moral behavior, one

683
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.770
direction or the other. If you've spent a hell

684
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.310
of a long time sitting and thinking about the

685
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.750
root of human goodness and evil and what we

686
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.570
owe our fellow humans and is their purpose in

687
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.600
life that transcends us. It doesn't really matter if

688
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.620
your conclusion is there is a God or there

689
00:43:17.629 --> 00:43:21.129
is no God or we're free agents or we

690
00:43:21.139 --> 00:43:23.649
have no free will whatsoever. You're one of the

691
00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:26.250
ones who thought long and hard about it and

692
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.500
both sets of conclusions you come out as being

693
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:35.530
more ethically moral than your average person. Um So

694
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.469
people are not going to run amok if they

695
00:43:39.479 --> 00:43:43.000
are raised from the very beginning to think this

696
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.790
is not a world where it is fair. To

697
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.239
blame anyone and I don't deserve to get this

698
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.820
or that reward more than anyone else. They're going

699
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:55.389
to be past the notion. Oh, no one's gonna

700
00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:57.780
hold me responsible. I can go and stab the

701
00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:00.810
old lady there with any luck to be past

702
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.419
that by the time they're like, 20 years old.

703
00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.679
And I was here hearing all the time people

704
00:44:09.689 --> 00:44:15.080
saying that hard determinist were all nihilists and atheists

705
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.949
and they were all the time, uh, pillaging and

706
00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:21.379
raping and murdering people.

707
00:44:21.449 --> 00:44:26.570
Exactly. Because that's, that's the logical first thing. Um,

708
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.199
THE logical second thing that was also, went back

709
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.080
in your question is when you get past, oh,

710
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:34.729
should I run amok and do whatever I want

711
00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:37.459
all of that is, should I get depressed as

712
00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:41.239
hell? Because there's no purpose to any of this?

713
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:46.909
There's this huge existential void out there. Should I

714
00:44:46.919 --> 00:44:50.719
like, is this terrible thing to have people believe

715
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.909
in terms of their mental health and stuff? Um,

716
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.699
AND a point, like, it took me five years

717
00:44:57.709 --> 00:45:00.790
to write this book and the 1st 4.5 years

718
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.409
I was thinking the answer to that was gonna

719
00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:06.620
have to be. Yeah. And that sucks. And it's

720
00:45:06.629 --> 00:45:09.610
awful. But, you know, that's how things work and,

721
00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.600
like, come on, we need to be adults and

722
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.110
face reality and it finally struck me the much

723
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.560
more meaningful answer to it, which is, if you

724
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:23.330
are convinced there's no free will and you get

725
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:28.959
totally depressed and empty void because it means your

726
00:45:28.969 --> 00:45:32.919
accomplishments. You didn't really earn that. The people who

727
00:45:32.929 --> 00:45:35.350
loved you don't really love you for who you

728
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.100
are. But for biological stuff that you helped this

729
00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.070
old woman cross the street just now. Not because

730
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.840
you're a good person, but because that's how you

731
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.199
function as machine. All that. Oh my God. This

732
00:45:47.209 --> 00:45:52.110
is so depressing. If that's your response, you're one

733
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.550
of the lucky ones. You've got the luck and

734
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.760
privilege to sit there and say, oh my God,

735
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:02.580
maybe I really didn't earn my wonderful university degree.

736
00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:05.780
Oh my God. Maybe I didn't really deserve to

737
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.199
be liked by people because of my personality. If

738
00:46:09.209 --> 00:46:11.679
you're someone who has spent your whole life paying

739
00:46:11.689 --> 00:46:17.959
the price of your parents, poverty or the fact

740
00:46:17.969 --> 00:46:20.479
that you don't have an attractive face or the

741
00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:23.139
fact that you have the genes that deep predispose

742
00:46:23.149 --> 00:46:27.280
you towards obesity and people recoil from overweight people.

743
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.429
Or because you turned out not to be so

744
00:46:29.439 --> 00:46:31.860
smart or it turns out you can't control your

745
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:35.239
behavior because of biology. All that getting rid of

746
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.040
the free will concept does is be liberating. You

747
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.370
don't have a shitty soul because your life has

748
00:46:43.379 --> 00:46:46.860
not turned out that well. And for most people,

749
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.850
that's the much more important outcome to all of

750
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.830
this than deciding, oh, I guess I really didn't

751
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.260
earn my million dollars to be a millionaire. Um,

752
00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.060
FOR most people getting rid of the concept of

753
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.959
free will is not gonna make us like crazy

754
00:47:02.969 --> 00:47:08.479
and nihilistic. Um It's gonna be liberating. Mhm

755
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:12.360
But uh going back just for a second to

756
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.229
one of the initial points I brought to the

757
00:47:15.239 --> 00:47:18.169
table when it comes to the fact that we

758
00:47:18.179 --> 00:47:21.899
do not yet have a complete science of human

759
00:47:21.909 --> 00:47:27.350
behavior and we cannot 100% predict how someone will

760
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.270
behave in a particular situation. Uh What if someone

761
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.909
heard your arguments of behavioral scientist and said, oh

762
00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:40.010
OK, Dr Sapolsky, your arguments are great, the science

763
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.679
is awesome. But since we still do not have

764
00:47:43.689 --> 00:47:48.070
a complete picture of human behavior, at least for

765
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.629
the time being, I will refrain from making absolute

766
00:47:52.725 --> 00:47:56.584
claims, uh claims regarding free will. I will wait

767
00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:59.264
and see. I mean, basically what I'm asking you

768
00:47:59.274 --> 00:48:02.385
is do you think that the fact that we

769
00:48:02.395 --> 00:48:05.375
do not yet have a complete science of free

770
00:48:05.385 --> 00:48:09.344
will uh would make uh such a claim that

771
00:48:09.354 --> 00:48:14.475
we should reframe, refrain from making such absolute claims

772
00:48:14.485 --> 00:48:16.344
about free will uh make

773
00:48:16.354 --> 00:48:22.679
sense, right? Um Two types of answers there. The

774
00:48:22.689 --> 00:48:26.520
first one is um yeah, it's gonna be so

775
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.510
hard to subtract out thinking there's free will because

776
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.810
we don't have the solid scientific facts yet. For

777
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.330
centuries, all we've done over and over is figure

778
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.909
out that responsibility turns out not to have something

779
00:48:39.919 --> 00:48:44.370
to do with our behavior. Turns out hailstorms are

780
00:48:44.379 --> 00:48:48.310
not caused by witches, it turns out people who

781
00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:53.100
have epileptic seizures are not possessed by Satan or

782
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:57.139
even within the last 50 years or so. It

783
00:48:57.149 --> 00:49:01.860
turns out people come down with the disease. Schizophrenia,

784
00:49:01.909 --> 00:49:07.209
not because their mothers were psycho dynamically, monsters who

785
00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:11.100
hated them. And all that happened at each one

786
00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:15.129
of those points is you tell the mothers of,

787
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.330
you know, hundreds of thousands of people with schizophrenia,

788
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.229
it's not your fault. It's a neuro genetic disorder.

789
00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:26.679
All you've done is freed them all you've done

790
00:49:26.689 --> 00:49:29.219
when you figured out that this kid in your

791
00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:33.040
classroom where you're a teacher just can't learn to

792
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.709
read and this kid is just lazy and un

793
00:49:35.719 --> 00:49:39.439
mot no, there's something in their cortex that could

794
00:49:39.449 --> 00:49:43.669
be identified by scientists so that they reverse letters

795
00:49:43.679 --> 00:49:47.570
in their mind. They have dyslexia, it's not their

796
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:51.429
fault. We can't explain yet who gets dyslexia and

797
00:49:51.439 --> 00:49:54.520
who doesn't? We have only hints from prenatal environment,

798
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.590
blah, blah, blah. But we know enough that it

799
00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.820
is both intellectually and morally bankrupt to decide that

800
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.459
this child is lazy and unmotivated and to instead

801
00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:11.610
recognize we've identified their particular type of biological constraint

802
00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.979
and all that's going to happen in the future

803
00:50:13.989 --> 00:50:17.219
is more and more and more of those. And

804
00:50:17.229 --> 00:50:20.300
all we can be at this point is accepting

805
00:50:20.419 --> 00:50:23.320
that a whole lot of things that pulls out

806
00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.179
the ugliest in us in the way of judgment.

807
00:50:27.889 --> 00:50:30.989
We're gonna wind up saying, oh my God, I

808
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.510
had no, I had no idea. It had something

809
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.550
to do with that or framed a different way.

810
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we can't sit there and say

811
00:50:38.129 --> 00:50:41.179
somebody with this sort of upbringing, we can absolutely

812
00:50:41.189 --> 00:50:44.129
predict that they're gonna wind up going to a

813
00:50:44.139 --> 00:50:47.320
top university or wind up being a multiple murderer.

814
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.500
Yeah, we can't predict that yet. The science isn't

815
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.814
good enough. The science is good enough on a

816
00:50:52.824 --> 00:50:56.524
population level. Any time you could look at an

817
00:50:56.534 --> 00:51:02.014
entire population and say for every increased incidence of

818
00:51:02.024 --> 00:51:06.705
a horrible childhood experience, you've just increased 35% the

819
00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:08.764
likelihood that they're going to be arrested by the

820
00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:12.280
time they're 20 you got enough science. At that

821
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:16.100
point, you've got enough science that you better know

822
00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.120
you have no leg to stand on. If you

823
00:51:18.129 --> 00:51:21.409
sit there and say this kid this 20 year

824
00:51:21.429 --> 00:51:24.679
old, what can I say? They're just plain evil.

825
00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:30.110
This kid, if you 35% for each step, there's

826
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.350
enough science at this point, there's enough knowledge there.

827
00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:37.649
If you have, I don't know whatever percent predictability

828
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.949
that if your mother was drinking heavily when you're

829
00:51:40.959 --> 00:51:44.620
a fetus, you've got this likelihood of having an

830
00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:49.290
IQ below this. And someday when you're failing classes,

831
00:51:50.669 --> 00:51:53.530
we know enough science already. In all these cases,

832
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.250
we know enough science because we run an entire

833
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:04.889
society on statistical guilt and statistical wonderful accomplishments. And

834
00:52:04.899 --> 00:52:07.739
we know enough now to know that those are

835
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.449
not OK.

836
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.530
So I have one last question then what would

837
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:19.169
it take for, for someone to convince you that

838
00:52:19.179 --> 00:52:23.719
you're wrong and actually free will exists?

839
00:52:25.419 --> 00:52:28.959
OK? Here's, here's my pain in the ass response.

840
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.469
And the philosophers are going to like, oh come

841
00:52:32.479 --> 00:52:36.070
on, give me a break. Um The version that

842
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.929
they start off with is oh, come on, give

843
00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:40.409
me a break is you've just done something, you've

844
00:52:40.419 --> 00:52:43.389
pulled a trigger on a gun, you just did

845
00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:47.899
something consequential And here's the muscles that contract it.

846
00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:51.310
And here's the three motor neurons that just sent

847
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.860
that command. And if you wanna convince us that

848
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:58.370
free will actually exist, show us that those neurons

849
00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:03.060
just did what they did independent of what any

850
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:05.080
other neuron in the brain was doing at that

851
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.919
moment. If you could do that, you've just proven

852
00:53:07.929 --> 00:53:09.919
free will. And they say, oh come on, give

853
00:53:09.929 --> 00:53:12.979
us a break. That's ridiculous. A demand. I would

854
00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:16.340
demand a whole lot more than that. I would

855
00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:20.530
say. Show me that those three neurons just told

856
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.280
you to pull that trigger, having nothing to do

857
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.919
with what any other neuron was whispering to it

858
00:53:25.929 --> 00:53:28.760
at the time and having nothing to do with

859
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.780
your hormone levels that morning and having nothing to

860
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.300
do with your history of trauma and having nothing

861
00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:36.959
to do with your genes. So show me that

862
00:53:36.969 --> 00:53:40.239
if you had changed any of those, those neurons

863
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.129
would still have done the exact same thing at

864
00:53:42.139 --> 00:53:45.760
that moment, then I'll believe in free will and

865
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:49.729
you can't, you can't show that because nothing going

866
00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:53.139
on in you right now is anything but the

867
00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:57.219
outcome of all of that stuff that came beforehand,

868
00:53:57.229 --> 00:54:02.939
perhaps unpredictably, perhaps in some nonlinear, non additive cool

869
00:54:02.949 --> 00:54:06.159
way, perhaps in an emergent way that we can't

870
00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:09.209
even begin to mix. But that's all we are.

871
00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:12.340
Nothing more or less and show me a neuron

872
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:16.310
that just decided to do what it did independent

873
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.449
of everything that came before that millisecond. And if

874
00:54:20.459 --> 00:54:22.080
you could do that, I believe in free will

875
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:27.139
and uh philosophers are gonna hate it. But what

876
00:54:27.149 --> 00:54:29.679
I think any biologist who knows this stuff would

877
00:54:29.689 --> 00:54:33.729
say is, yeah, that's kind of what you need

878
00:54:33.739 --> 00:54:37.469
to show. That's kind of the proof that is

879
00:54:37.479 --> 00:54:40.429
needed to show that there really is free will

880
00:54:41.129 --> 00:54:43.310
and that's pretty damn unlikely to be able to

881
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.070
show that.

882
00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:50.330
OK. So let's see if someone accepts the challenge.

883
00:54:52.379 --> 00:54:57.149
So, yeah, so the book is again, determined a

884
00:54:57.159 --> 00:55:00.780
science of life without free will. I'm leaving a

885
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:04.399
link within the description box of this interview. Um

886
00:55:04.409 --> 00:55:07.770
Doctor Sapolsky, just before we go apart from the

887
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:10.850
book, would you like to mention briefly where people

888
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.550
can find you and your work on the internet?

889
00:55:13.959 --> 00:55:19.550
Um Let's see, I'm I am a medieval peasant

890
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.840
in that. Not only don't, I do Facebook, I

891
00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:26.090
don't know how to, don't, not only do I

892
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.100
not do Instagram or any of these things that

893
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.500
my kids say that I don't understand. So I

894
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.870
have no presence there, but there's a bunch of

895
00:55:34.879 --> 00:55:38.129
my lectures that have been put up on youtube.

896
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:42.840
Um I teach a class at Stanford every other

897
00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:46.610
year on the biology of human social behavior. That's

898
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.919
basically the last hour stretched out over entire semester.

899
00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:53.139
And years ago, Stanford posted all of those lectures

900
00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.310
up there and one of these years I have

901
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.149
to update them. So go to youtube. Uh You'll

902
00:55:59.159 --> 00:56:02.179
see I'm doing the exact same ranting and raving

903
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.899
word for word and a number of those like

904
00:56:04.909 --> 00:56:08.139
talks that overlap, but that would be a good

905
00:56:08.149 --> 00:56:08.689
place.

906
00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:14.419
Ok, great. So, Doctor Sapolsky, thank you again for
