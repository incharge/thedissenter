00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.119
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.000
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs and

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.899
to them, joined by Doctor Michael Frank. He is

4
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.710
David and Lucille Packard, professor of Human Biology and

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.780
Director of the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University.

6
00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:21.370
He studies children's language learning and how it interacts

7
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:26.129
with their developing understanding of the social world. And

8
00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:30.329
today we're talking about topics like infant directed speech,

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.110
pragmatic abilities, similarity reasoning, some other aspects of language

10
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:40.319
learning, parenting, attitudes and related topics. So, Doctor Frank,

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.630
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.790
Uh Yeah. So let's get into the questions then.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.150
Um WHAT is infant directed speech? And in what

14
00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.860
ways does it differ from speech directed at adults?

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.459
So when we talk to babies, we talk in

16
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.560
a very specific way, our voices get kind of

17
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.279
high and squeaky. Uh WE tend to simplify what

18
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.989
we say and this is based on the age

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.580
of the baby we're talking to. But if we're

20
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:14.160
talking to a very young baby, you might hold

21
00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:16.290
them in your arms and say, oh, aren't you

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.459
a nice baby? That would be profoundly weird to

23
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.279
do if you were talking to an adult. Um

24
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.910
So all of that simplification uh stretching out, making

25
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:30.349
more melodic. Uh ALL of that makes the speech

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.529
exciting and interesting to infants and seems to draw

27
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.110
their attention

28
00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:40.489
and I is infant directed speech the same across

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.470
all cultures or does it vary, for example, in

30
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.389
form or in prevalence? Uh How does it work

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.220
exactly? I think Americans are maybe among the most

32
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.400
uh fond of really changing their speech to, to

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.610
infants. So uh American infant directed speech is the

34
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.279
most exaggerated in its characteristics. And there are other

35
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.059
cultures in Northern Europe that use much less uh

36
00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.988
infant directed speech. So it was initially thought that

37
00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.468
infant directed speech was completely universal. I I think

38
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.828
it's turned out to be quite variable. Um Nobody

39
00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.108
talks to infants exactly the same way they talk

40
00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.488
to adults. I I would say, but the degree

41
00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:25.048
of exaggeration and change and the nature of that

42
00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.779
change can vary across cultures.

43
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.929
And do we have any idea why there is

44
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.080
that variability? Where exactly does it stem from?

45
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.919
We're not sure where that variability comes from. Uh

46
00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.529
But it likely intersects with cultural views on childhood

47
00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.009
and parenthood and the ways that we think it's

48
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.970
appropriate to interact with kids. So in some cultures,

49
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.949
infants are really a a key focal point for

50
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.410
for discussion and conversation. We really focus in on

51
00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.460
them. That's not just in the US and the

52
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.169
developed world there are some uh uh low and

53
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.259
middle income contexts. Uh There are even some traditional

54
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.850
societies where kids are really focal point and there

55
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.710
are other contexts where uh Children are not expected

56
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.559
to be talked to or heard from until they

57
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.699
become verbal themselves. So there's quite, quite wide variability

58
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.559
in our attitudes towards childhood. And that probably drives

59
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.270
the ways we uh culturally think about um expressing

60
00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.449
ourselves the kind of register or mode of speech

61
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.029
that we use.

62
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:33.419
And does infant directed speech help Children or infants

63
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.149
in this case, learn a language easier because that's

64
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.580
a common idea out there. But is it true?

65
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.679
Yeah, I think there are two ways that people

66
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.960
have thought about infant directed speech helping. The first

67
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.360
way I think is almost certainly true, which is

68
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.059
that infant directed speech draws infants attention. So the

69
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.600
study that I was involved in that, that looked

70
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.869
at this is called uh many Babies one, it

71
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.520
was a giant collaborative project across many different labs

72
00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.660
across many different countries. And what we did was

73
00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.330
we looked at babies preference for infant directed speech.

74
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.869
And we found that across cultures, even when babies

75
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.199
were hearing speech in a language that they didn't

76
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.130
know they still like the infant directed version better.

77
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.190
So we found quite good evidence for uh widespread

78
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.369
cultural cross cultural consistency of infant directed speech preference.

79
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.239
Babies like to hear baby talk. Now, the second

80
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.260
way that infant directed speech could help is a

81
00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:33.700
little bit more controversial. It might be that some

82
00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.950
aspects of the structure are uniquely suited for learning.

83
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.119
So it might be that the ways we simplify

84
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.329
really help babies learn. And I think there's some

85
00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:45.380
evidence for that and some evidence against. So we,

86
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.250
we maybe we make these exaggerated sounds like hi

87
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.309
baby. Uh Maybe we make the vowels a little

88
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.029
bit more distinct from one another. Some cultures. Yeah,

89
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.739
maybe, yes, maybe no. Uh THE evidence is, is

90
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.589
a little weaker for that. We do also simplify

91
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.540
the sentence structure and we talk about things that

92
00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:04.059
are kind of in the here and now and

93
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.250
much more likely to be relevant to the baby.

94
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.959
And that aspect of infant directed speech probably does

95
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.609
help early language learning using kind of concrete restricted

96
00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.760
vocabulary, makes it a lot easier to figure out

97
00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:17.390
what words mean, especially when babies are starting to

98
00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.920
be in that age where they're starting to understand

99
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.720
how language is connecting to the world around them.

100
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.049
So not, not that super tiny newborns, but maybe

101
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.239
6789 month olds, especially going into the first year

102
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.709
when they're starting to um really uh begin to

103
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.200
produce words around their first birthday.

104
00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.609
And then in regards to some topics related to

105
00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:46.709
language learning, what are, what are pragmatic abilities.

106
00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:50.529
So when linguists talk about the structure of language,

107
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.309
they generally distinguish the sound levels that that's a

108
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.299
lot of what we were talking about when we

109
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.839
were talking about uh infant directed speech uh from

110
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.649
the, the lexicon and the morphology, the ways that

111
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.730
words are combined together in syntax, the semantics, the

112
00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:09.910
meaning. And then we talk about pragmatics, which is

113
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.220
the communicative aspect of language, the ways that we

114
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.970
reason about what somebody is trying to tell us

115
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.579
in a particular context. So syntax, semantics, morphology are

116
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.089
often thought to be kind of more context independent.

117
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:25.869
But the ways we modulate language depending on the

118
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.679
context, depending on the speaker, depending on the prior

119
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.570
discourse. All of that is what we refer to

120
00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:32.640
as pragmatics. Mhm

121
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.920
And what is similarity reasoning,

122
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.940
similarity reasoning? Uh Well, broadly speaking, we're talking about

123
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.940
now uh cognition rather than language. Here. We're talking

124
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.980
about the ways that we reason about the structure

125
00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:53.100
of concepts and uh how different concepts relate to

126
00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:56.260
one another. Uh So we've people in the uh

127
00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:59.989
studying the structure of concepts, the structure of knowledge

128
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160
have often used the idea of similarity as a

129
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.970
way in uh to studying the relationships between different

130
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.540
concepts.

131
00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:10.790
Uh And do we know if it also varies

132
00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:11.980
cross culturally?

133
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.279
Yeah, absolutely. So the ways that people conceptualize uh

134
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.059
the relationships between concepts is something that varies uh

135
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.920
quite a fair amount. Uh You know, just as

136
00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:26.730
as a one example of a widely studied cross

137
00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:30.899
cultural difference, there are differences between uh you know,

138
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.350
uh what's called taxonomic similarity uh similarity. Um IN

139
00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:41.019
uh you know the type of uh concept versus

140
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.019
a thematic similarity, similarity in the sort of situations

141
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.309
that that concept occurs in. So that sounds very

142
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.510
abstract. A concrete example of this is um if

143
00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.390
I uh ask you which is more similar dog

144
00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:57.255
versus cat or dog versus bone, dog versus cat,

145
00:07:57.265 --> 00:08:00.605
is that taxonomic level of similarity? Whereas dog versus

146
00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:03.864
bone is thematic dog and bone go together in

147
00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.795
situations, even though they're dissimilar in the kind of

148
00:08:06.804 --> 00:08:09.415
concept they are one is animate, one is inanimate

149
00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:13.614
and so forth. I and there's some evidence that

150
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:17.154
in different cultures, you get different levels of emphasis

151
00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:22.130
on taxonomic structures versus thematic structures. Um So, uh

152
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.350
what are sometimes referred to as weird cultures, Western

153
00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.450
educated, industrialized, rich democratic cultures uh tends to have

154
00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:34.129
more of a focus on uh taxonomic structures. Uh

155
00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:37.408
WHEREAS uh less weird context, which is of course

156
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.369
many different, it's not a category itself, it's a

157
00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:42.808
non category, but many other cultures uh show more

158
00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:45.249
interest in thematic reasoning. And this is something that's

159
00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:48.098
been pretty well studied between the West and East

160
00:08:48.109 --> 00:08:51.648
Asia. Uh AND also uh more traditional societies versus

161
00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:53.039
more industrialized societies.

162
00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:56.919
And do we have a good understanding of where

163
00:08:56.929 --> 00:08:59.059
that variability comes from?

164
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.940
I I would say not completely. Uh So, yeah,

165
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.669
it's a pretty deep and interesting question like how

166
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:12.729
the structure of our concepts reflects our broader theories

167
00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:14.950
of the world. My lab has done a little

168
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.640
bit of work on this. We're not specialists in

169
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.440
it. Uh But one thing we're interested in is

170
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.989
that reciprocal relationship between language and cognition that you

171
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.030
mentioned uh a little bit in your intro. So

172
00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:28.510
we've been interested in whether uh the structure of

173
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.549
kind of linguistic input to kids and to adults

174
00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:35.929
reflects those taxonomic and thematic uh relationships. And we,

175
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.590
we did find some initial evidence for it in

176
00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:40.159
a paper last year. So when you look at

177
00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:44.150
uh Chinese language corpora, they seem to uh show

178
00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:48.594
more kind of um semantic similarity uh on the

179
00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:51.655
uh thematic level. Whereas English language corporate maybe support

180
00:09:51.664 --> 00:09:55.135
uh taxonomic reasoning a bit more. So that's doesn't

181
00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:58.484
solve your chicken and egg question language to conception

182
00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:01.695
or conception to language, probably both influence each other.

183
00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:03.655
Uh But I, I think there's a suggestion that

184
00:10:03.664 --> 00:10:07.434
these different cross cultural ways of conceptualizing the world

185
00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:10.474
um really get reflected in language and maybe get

186
00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:12.155
perpetuated as well in language.

187
00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:18.190
Uh And the similarity reasoning connect in any way

188
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.049
to language or how people use language.

189
00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:27.849
Yeah, I mean, I think uh similarity and especially

190
00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:31.479
uh sameness identity uh have been really important lenses

191
00:10:31.489 --> 00:10:36.409
by which cognitive science has looked at language cognition

192
00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:38.859
development and how all of these things compare to

193
00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:45.280
one another. So uh the idea of sameness especially

194
00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:48.979
actually uh identity has been a really powerful lens

195
00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:53.200
to look at how uh language enables complex cognition.

196
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.729
So uh there are some, you know, studies using

197
00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:01.010
nonhuman animals and trying to train the concept of

198
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.489
exact identity and you, you can do this in

199
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.200
certain restricted cases. But uh for more complex tasks

200
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.419
using identity, it can be really true. Excuse me,

201
00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:13.270
really tricky to train a even a a great

202
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.760
ape to do these tasks. Um In contrast, they're

203
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.090
actually quite easy for uh human adults to pick

204
00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:22.049
up in just a couple of trials. So there's,

205
00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:23.719
there's really kind of a big boundary there. And

206
00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:25.940
people have hypothesized that language has something to do

207
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.239
with that. Uh So one example, uh uh the

208
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.840
speculation is that language trained primates seem to be

209
00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:35.929
the only ones who can succeed in these kinds

210
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.080
of really complex identity and relational reasoning tasks about

211
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.969
um sameness. So yeah, the, the these general notions

212
00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:47.400
but um similarity and identity have really structured our

213
00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:50.659
conversation about how language connects to thought and how

214
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:54.020
that relates to uh you know, children's growing conception

215
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.059
when they learn a language and the boundaries between

216
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.250
uh nonhuman animals and uh and humans

217
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.460
do Children learn some words earlier than others. And

218
00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:10.260
if so, why does that happen?

219
00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:14.390
Yeah. So, so the words that kids learn earliest

220
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.130
tend to be things that are grounded in their

221
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.690
environment. Um So they refer mostly to the people

222
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.880
around them. Uh THE social routines they engage in

223
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.299
like high by bath time, peek a boo, uh

224
00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:30.690
then the small objects and animals around them, dog

225
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.570
ball uh these kinds of things. So the earliest

226
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.210
learned words are those that are supported both by

227
00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:40.200
the conception of the kids, the ways that they

228
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.840
understand the world and also by the input, they

229
00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:45.830
get the language that they are hearing around them.

230
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.599
Uh And is this consistent in any way across

231
00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:52.440
languages?

232
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:58.549
Surprisingly consistent? Actually, of course, the big feature of

233
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:01.669
uh words is that the words themselves, their forms

234
00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:06.169
vary across languages. But uh what's surprising, I think

235
00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:09.789
from my perspective, looking at cross cultural data is

236
00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:13.580
that the actual concepts that kids learn early are

237
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.020
really quite related to one another. So one of

238
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.809
the big projects that my lab does is called

239
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.440
Word Bank. This is a site that offers up

240
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.989
a database of children's early words and uh parents

241
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.500
reports about their language more broadly to uh to

242
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.609
people around the world. And we host data from,

243
00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:36.210
I think at this 0.30 or 40 languages uh

244
00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:39.229
from around the world, of course, focused mostly on,

245
00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:42.239
you know, uh the developed world and uh Indo

246
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.989
European languages, but increasingly broadening to some East Asian

247
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.250
languages and non indo-european languages um from other regions.

248
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.989
So when you look at these data, you can

249
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.059
look and ask, well, what are the 1st 10

250
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.270
words look like for kids around the world? And

251
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.969
it's really, I think, fascinating to see that kids

252
00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:02.369
around the world like to talk about these social

253
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.309
routines and the routines aren't that different. I mean,

254
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.969
it's greeting people, it's saying goodbye to people. Um

255
00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.090
It's the games we like to play with babies.

256
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.489
Uh It's the, you know, the routines that we

257
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.650
do with them as well as the people around

258
00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:17.299
them. The kinship terms like mother, father, grandmother, sister,

259
00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:20.840
brother. Uh AND, and then of course, like fun

260
00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:24.880
small toys. Uh AND, and animals. So II I

261
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.359
mentioned that this is what we talk to kids

262
00:14:27.369 --> 00:14:28.960
about that that's important and this is these are

263
00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:31.169
things that kids can understand in their environment. One

264
00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:32.960
other thing I should say is there's probably also

265
00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:35.780
some degree of children's own interest that babies around

266
00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:41.469
the world, like small animals, like balls and toys,

267
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.919
uh like interacting socially with the people around them.

268
00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:46.340
And all of that is, is very important and

269
00:14:46.349 --> 00:14:48.159
probably drives their early word learning.

270
00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:55.270
And so before Children begin their formal education, when

271
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.969
they do it, because of course, it's not the

272
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.570
case that in all human societies, there's formal education

273
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.969
but uh in, in the societies where there is

274
00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:08.890
formal education before Children begin it. Uh What sources

275
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.570
of information do they use to infer the meaning

276
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.570
of words?

277
00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:20.320
The biggest one is the social interaction with the

278
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.409
people around them. So earliest words are typically learned

279
00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:27.440
in what we call grounded social interaction that is

280
00:15:27.489 --> 00:15:30.229
um you know, you can imagine a, a caregiver

281
00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:33.989
and a child playing or talking about things that

282
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.320
are in the here and now around them. And

283
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.700
those uh that those learning instances are often accompanied

284
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.900
by social cues. Like um the uh parent is

285
00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.859
sometimes pointing to the object or uh showing it

286
00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:48.679
to the child with their hands, they might be

287
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.109
jointly holding it. Uh This creates what, what researchers

288
00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:55.190
are referred to as joint attention where both the

289
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.909
child and the parent know or the caregiver know

290
00:15:57.919 --> 00:16:00.880
that they're talking about the same thing. THEY establish

291
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.559
a context in which it's mutually known that we're

292
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.650
talking about this object. And then when they use

293
00:16:05.659 --> 00:16:07.820
a word, that name could be mapped to that

294
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.099
object pretty effectively. Now, the prevalence of joint attention

295
00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:15.380
across cultures and societies does differ. So uh the

296
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.830
character I'm giving here of, of, of this kind

297
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.440
of interaction is most frequent in the kind of

298
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.299
um very child focused interactions that you see in

299
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:27.859
the US and in Europe. Uh AND and as

300
00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:30.205
a little bit less common in other societies where

301
00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:33.474
learning from overhearing happens more where where the child

302
00:16:33.484 --> 00:16:37.424
may be observing a an interaction between two peers

303
00:16:37.434 --> 00:16:40.474
or between a a caregiver and an older child

304
00:16:40.484 --> 00:16:42.744
and observe that same kind of ground and interaction.

305
00:16:42.755 --> 00:16:44.655
But now as a third party rather than as

306
00:16:44.664 --> 00:16:46.255
the uh the second person.

307
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:53.140
And so does uh language learning in Children interact

308
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.950
in any way with their understanding of the social

309
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.309
world? I mean, does one influence the other?

310
00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:04.680
Well, I think of the social understanding and the

311
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:08.130
social motivation of Children as a really key driver

312
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.449
of language learning, it's kind of the engine that

313
00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:14.459
drives that, that uh vehicle forward it. Uh So

314
00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:16.569
the extent to which you care about and want

315
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.510
to affiliate with and want to share with other

316
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.689
people uh is really, you know, that that's the

317
00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:23.800
extent to which you're really engaging with language and

318
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.640
using it and practicing it. And that, that's very

319
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.810
much the, the position that been advocated for by

320
00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:31.780
Michael Thomasel O and his collaborators over the years.

321
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.969
So uh that said that engine gets increasingly more

322
00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:40.160
sophisticated as you can use language to understand the

323
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.949
nature of the interactions that are happening. I I've

324
00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:45.939
argued for a lot of continuity in social cognition

325
00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:48.650
from uh very early on until uh you know,

326
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.369
kind of later in language development. So I think

327
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.469
even quite young infants have some sense of how

328
00:17:55.479 --> 00:18:00.699
conversation works and how uh language functions to transfer

329
00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:05.579
information between people. But there's some refinement that can

330
00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:08.219
happen. Um One big debate that's happening in the

331
00:18:08.229 --> 00:18:10.089
field right now and that I I'm uncertain about

332
00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:13.449
the answer to is whether language plays a really

333
00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:16.449
critical role in enabling uh reasoning about other people's

334
00:18:16.459 --> 00:18:19.910
beliefs, either in allowing the discovery of that or

335
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.430
at least allowing you to represent other people's beliefs

336
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:25.239
sufficiently. Uh So I think in, in some sense,

337
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.880
the jury is still out about that, probably language

338
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.660
plays some role, maybe it's not a constitutive role.

339
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.829
But I, so, so that's one way in which

340
00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:37.739
uh understanding language better could really help drive a

341
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.050
uh uh social cognitive ability in this case theory

342
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.560
of mind.

343
00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:44.290
So I've asked you about some of the ways

344
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.800
that language acquisition varies cross culturally. But what do

345
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:54.250
we know about the universality of language acquisition? Are

346
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.319
there many human universals in this regard?

347
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.290
Universal? And the, the question of, of, of Invariant

348
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.329
here has been a one of the most controversial

349
00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:09.650
topics in language acquisition and cognitive science more generally.

350
00:19:09.709 --> 00:19:13.479
So it it's very complex to state something like

351
00:19:13.489 --> 00:19:16.180
universal, especially when we have data, really, you know,

352
00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:19.229
good rich data about a very small set of

353
00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:22.520
the world's current languages and especially of the languages

354
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.030
that have ever existed. Maybe they're, you know, hundreds

355
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.819
of thousands of languages that have existed and maybe

356
00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:30.079
uh you know, 8000 right now. And we have

357
00:19:30.089 --> 00:19:33.420
really good data um about just a small handful,

358
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.770
a couple of dozen. And, and really most of

359
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.819
the studies have been concentrated in just AAA tiny

360
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:41.910
number. So it's tough to make strong claims about

361
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.489
universality. The way we talk about this with respect

362
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.729
to the data that I work on is about

363
00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:52.770
relative consistency and variability of different aspects of language

364
00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.010
learning. So that turns out I think a really

365
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.180
complex kind of black and white uh you know,

366
00:19:58.189 --> 00:20:01.569
issue about um human nature as it's been framed

367
00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:05.209
into a statistical question of how consistent a particular

368
00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:09.650
phenomenon is across languages. And so when you use

369
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.459
that sort of statistical lens, you can quantify, OK,

370
00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:14.520
in the sample we have with all of its

371
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.089
limitations. Uh Are there things that tend to be

372
00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:20.140
relatively more consistent? And I would say yes, there

373
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.079
certainly are. So, one thing that's very consistent across

374
00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:28.489
languages is uh how connected different aspects of language

375
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.680
are. So, uh when you go to the linguistics

376
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:33.939
department, like we were talking about, you've got, you

377
00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:37.219
know, sounds and words and word parts and uh

378
00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:41.380
connections between words, syntax and semantics and for meaning

379
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.449
and it sounds like those are really distinct modular

380
00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:46.204
things. But one of the biggest generalizations from our

381
00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:48.535
work is that when you go across cultures, no

382
00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:51.064
matter what culture you're looking at, if you're good

383
00:20:51.074 --> 00:20:54.234
at gesturing and communication, you're good at words. If

384
00:20:54.244 --> 00:20:56.084
you've got a lot of words, you're good at

385
00:20:56.094 --> 00:20:57.964
putting word parts together. And if you're good at

386
00:20:57.974 --> 00:21:01.114
putting word parts together, you're good at creating sentences

387
00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:05.589
so structured as a function of individual variability, there's

388
00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:08.420
actually a lot of consistency in how tightly woven

389
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.900
the language system is that all of the different

390
00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.790
parts connect to one another within individuals. That's just

391
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.469
an example of something that turns out to be

392
00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:19.000
very consistent across languages. I'm not gonna call that

393
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.469
a universal. We don't have the sample diversity to,

394
00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:23.829
to make that kind of claim, but it, it

395
00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:26.780
is very striking to me that in the languages

396
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.790
we study, we really consistently see that.

397
00:21:29.349 --> 00:21:33.270
Mhm. So changing topics, I would like to ask,

398
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.609
you know, a little bit about polite language. I

399
00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:40.699
mean, how does it emerge and why do people

400
00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:43.609
use it particularly if we take into account that

401
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.910
many times it implies making statements that are imprecise,

402
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.829
inefficient and even sometimes untrue.

403
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.660
Yeah, I love this. So we're going from the

404
00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.030
question of universality to something that's clearly very, very

405
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.680
culturally specific and very culturally conditioned and, and really

406
00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.599
fascinating for that reason. So politeness is this way

407
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:10.790
that we navigate the social world using language. I

408
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.380
in some sense, I, I like to think of

409
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.140
politeness as kind of the the expert level, you

410
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.479
know, the the God mode level of a theory

411
00:22:17.489 --> 00:22:20.060
of mind, right? If you're good at theory of

412
00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:22.170
mind, you, you're good at tracking other people's beliefs,

413
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.319
you're really good at theory of mind, you can

414
00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:27.439
manage their expectations, you can manage their feelings, you

415
00:22:27.449 --> 00:22:30.079
can manage your own self presentation uh and how

416
00:22:30.089 --> 00:22:34.280
you appear through your use of language. So I

417
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.089
politeness, roughly speaking, I would say is, is the

418
00:22:39.099 --> 00:22:43.079
set of ways we use language outside of the

419
00:22:43.089 --> 00:22:46.119
goal of information transfer uh to manage our social

420
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:50.250
relationships and our, our presentation of ourselves. And so

421
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.229
this um this set of ideas comes from the

422
00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:56.930
uh anthropological linguistics literature where they talk about the

423
00:22:56.939 --> 00:22:59.869
use of language to manage face or appearance to

424
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.449
the community. Uh And it has a really long

425
00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.229
tradition because the, the ways that we go about

426
00:23:06.239 --> 00:23:08.959
managing face and using politeness differs so much from

427
00:23:08.969 --> 00:23:13.939
culture to culture. I have worked on this topic

428
00:23:13.949 --> 00:23:17.329
using a set of um ideas about pragmatics that

429
00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:20.400
are related to the rational use of language. So

430
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.650
um my collaborators and I notably my longtime collaborator,

431
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.300
Noah Goodman and I have I proposed this model

432
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.880
of pragmatic language use called the rational speech Act

433
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.020
model. And the basic idea of that model is

434
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.910
that you use language to get information across in

435
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.180
a way that uh helps you be sure that

436
00:23:40.189 --> 00:23:43.280
another person who's reasoning equally rationally about the language

437
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.760
used could figure out what you were trying to

438
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.989
say. Uh And so that's, that's fundamentally about information

439
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.609
transfer. And we started studying uh politeness because the

440
00:23:51.619 --> 00:23:54.089
case where that model really fails. If you just

441
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.750
think about languages, information transfer, as you said, it's

442
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.349
very hard to figure out why you would say

443
00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:01.709
these things that are long vague and precise, sometimes

444
00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:06.579
even false. And our answer was, well, you sometimes

445
00:24:06.589 --> 00:24:08.630
care about information transfer, but sometimes you care about

446
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.510
these other goals, like being nice or looking like

447
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.839
a person who's nice, uh respectful and so forth.

448
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.160
And uh if you think about the effort that

449
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.959
you spend to produce language as a cost, then

450
00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:25.459
you're essentially paying that cost to signal that you're

451
00:24:25.469 --> 00:24:29.630
a nice or uh respectful person. So the more

452
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.130
verbiage you use, the more you're kind of signaling,

453
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.079
hey, I respect you. I feel that it is

454
00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:38.079
important that I show how much I respect you

455
00:24:38.089 --> 00:24:40.739
by paying this cost. If I say open the

456
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.770
window, OK. That's the most direct information transfer about

457
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.310
my desires. But if I say, hey, I'm so

458
00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.250
sorry to bother you and I know you're involved

459
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.180
in other things. But maybe if you have a

460
00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:53.270
moment in the next few minutes, it would be

461
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.349
really great. If you could just manage to open

462
00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:57.670
the window, it's like a caricature, right? I've spent

463
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.170
all this time to try to show how much

464
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.890
I care about your feelings, same information, but greater

465
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.349
cost. So I'm like kind of burning money here

466
00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:09.880
to try to convince you that I care about

467
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.900
your, you know, your feelings and respect them.

468
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.000
But when you said at the beginning of your

469
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.829
answer that this is, this tends to be very

470
00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:22.310
culture specific. What does that mean exactly? Uh uh

471
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.750
I mean, does it mean that what we consider

472
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.219
to be polite is culture specific or that across

473
00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:35.270
cultures, there are varying degrees of politeness in language.

474
00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:38.819
Uh So both I, I almost everything about this

475
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:45.349
particular cultural ritual varies. Um So in some cultures,

476
00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:48.510
it is really critical to use this kind of

477
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.400
extra verbiage. Um And that can be both the

478
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.189
kind of unconventional or slightly just um unstructured uh

479
00:25:56.199 --> 00:25:59.390
uh extra um extra verbiage around a request that

480
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.540
I just gave my example or it could be

481
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.430
specific markers of politeness that indicate the status relationships.

482
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:08.469
And these are grammatical or morphology and in quite

483
00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:11.400
a number of languages, um you know, they used

484
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.119
to be in English, they are still to a

485
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.079
certain extent in, in romance languages where you have

486
00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:19.040
formal, informal, distinguish uh distinguished by the morphology, but

487
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.959
they're much more complex politeness marking systems and a

488
00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:25.280
wide variety of other languages. Uh So, so you

489
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.479
get those, those sorts of, of markers that can

490
00:26:27.489 --> 00:26:30.260
differ. Um But you also get really big differences

491
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.790
in the norms in some cultures. It's very annoying

492
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.020
to ask very slowly and beat around the bush

493
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.319
and, and be indirect and in some cultures, it's

494
00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:41.510
absolutely critical and, and a marker of respect. So,

495
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.060
the collaborator that I worked with on this Erica

496
00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:47.189
Yon was from Korea and she had this really

497
00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:51.459
interesting experience studying um Korean politeness versus politeness in

498
00:26:51.469 --> 00:26:53.650
the US. And then her third comparison was in

499
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.380
India. So uh she, she was studying this task

500
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:01.900
where we say, um you know, uh Adam has

501
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.400
written a poem and he doesn't know how good

502
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.800
the poem is. So he asks Betty, uh what

503
00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.339
did you think of my poem? And Betty actually

504
00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:12.949
thinks the poem was terrible as an example, by

505
00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.979
the way. Um uh That's uh from JF Boon

506
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.510
originally. We, we adapted it. So OK, Betty is

507
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.390
in this dilemma. She thinks the poem is terrible.

508
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.670
Does she tell him the poem is terrible or

509
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.859
does she, uh, prevaricate a little bit? Say it

510
00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:29.760
was not bad or does she lie and say

511
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.569
it was great? And when we start to query

512
00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:37.579
people's intuitions about this cross culturally, uh, you know,

513
00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:39.900
the Americans, I think typically go with some sort

514
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.959
of prevarication is, you know, uh, not bad. Yeah,

515
00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:46.390
it's ok. Uh OH, you know, it's, uh, some

516
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.050
people liked it, something like this. I, we actually

517
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.180
got some of our Indian participants saying, well, it's,

518
00:27:53.439 --> 00:27:58.010
it's uh kind of impolite or, or not, right

519
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.709
to hold back how bad the poem is because

520
00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:04.239
it's gonna hurt Adam in the end. So, um

521
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.560
you know, Betty really needs to share what's true

522
00:28:06.569 --> 00:28:08.630
about the poem in order to help him. And

523
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.660
that's, that's how you are most helpful. Um The

524
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.540
Korean participants were much more on the side of

525
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.770
being polite about the poem and not sharing the

526
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.680
true uh information about it. So that's just a

527
00:28:20.689 --> 00:28:24.349
tiny little example but, but resonated with us because

528
00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:26.619
it felt like it related to these sort of

529
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.760
more general cultural norms that you see. I, I

530
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.099
remember um, a, a Dutch person was, was visiting

531
00:28:32.109 --> 00:28:33.329
my lab at the time we were doing this

532
00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:35.619
research and she heard this presentation and she said,

533
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.540
now I understand my own culture. It's totally impolite

534
00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.939
to withhold direct information. If you had information. How

535
00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:45.790
could you not share it? Yeah. So

536
00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:50.140
yeah. No, no, that's really fascinating. And I mentioned

537
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:55.500
Korea there and I'm somewhat familiar with the Japanese

538
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:59.150
culture, for example, and they have one very specific

539
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.599
thing there. I'm not sure if in other cultures,

540
00:29:01.609 --> 00:29:04.599
you also find it. But for example, if someone

541
00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:08.010
compliments you uh I mean in Portugal and in

542
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.560
the US, you would just say something like thank

543
00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:13.614
you, you so nice, something like that. But for

544
00:29:13.625 --> 00:29:17.474
example, there just to give a very specific example,

545
00:29:17.484 --> 00:29:21.655
if they complement your shoes, you're supposed to say,

546
00:29:21.665 --> 00:29:24.694
oh the they they're not that great. Come on.

547
00:29:24.944 --> 00:29:29.125
So I mean, they don't like people that brag

548
00:29:29.135 --> 00:29:31.435
at all. And so it's not only a thank

549
00:29:31.444 --> 00:29:36.329
you, it's oh they're nothing special. I mean, so

550
00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:40.229
there, there is that, for example, um so getting

551
00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:44.050
into another topic, uh tell us about how you

552
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.880
use and now I'm asking you specifically about some

553
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.729
of the methodology you use in your studies, how

554
00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:56.430
you use eye tracking and head mounted cameras to

555
00:29:56.439 --> 00:30:01.599
study children's early social and visual environment. So tell

556
00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:03.510
us about that and then I will ask some

557
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.819
follow up questions.

558
00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:09.099
Yeah, I, so I've always been fascinated by uh

559
00:30:09.109 --> 00:30:12.310
the possibility of using different methods to reveal new

560
00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:14.979
ways of looking at the uh the human mind,

561
00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:17.989
especially uh when you're talking about very young Children.

562
00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:21.599
So with adults, there is a lot you can

563
00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:24.150
do. It's not perfect. But, but, but it as

564
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.839
a well designed behavioral task can really reveal a

565
00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:30.839
tremendous amount about cognition, especially in the moment you

566
00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:32.810
can, you know, ask an adult to perform a

567
00:30:32.819 --> 00:30:35.520
complex task many times and really get a good

568
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.079
sense of how they make a particular inference when

569
00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:40.290
you're studying learning. And especially when you're studying learning

570
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.030
in small Children, you have a much more limited

571
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.890
behavioral repertoire that you're able to look at. And

572
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.560
you're also often interested in the environment of learning.

573
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:53.099
And so those two needs have led developmental lists

574
00:30:53.109 --> 00:30:55.599
to get more creative in terms of the particular

575
00:30:55.609 --> 00:30:58.640
measures they use to study the learning environment and

576
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.219
the consequences of learning. So I got excited about

577
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.520
eye tracking uh by working in Scott Johnson's lab

578
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.920
actually as a research assistant after college. So this

579
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.430
is 20 odd years ago and Scott was very

580
00:31:11.439 --> 00:31:13.770
interested in infant development and he really felt like

581
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.770
you could learn a lot about early infancy by

582
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.630
looking at eye movements. Um BECAUSE that was part

583
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.000
of the infants behavioral repertoire, they were relatively good

584
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.400
at. You could get multiple observations of where they

585
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.890
would look on a stimulus or how they would

586
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.400
predict an outcome uh by looking at their eye

587
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.250
movements. And that rich measure really could reveal much

588
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.469
more than say uh a kind of gross motor

589
00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:39.390
behavior like a reach um or even just a

590
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.500
um something like a single looking time, which is

591
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.819
more commonly used. So I got excited about eye

592
00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:47.520
tracking because of that. And I spent a bunch

593
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.819
of years really studying dynamics of eye movements in,

594
00:31:50.829 --> 00:31:54.640
in young Children and how they uh modulated their,

595
00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.910
their eye movements in different social scenes. That line

596
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.810
of research led me to think, well, you know,

597
00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:03.199
it would be really nice to know what their

598
00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:05.579
social input was. So if, if we think of

599
00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:09.239
their social uh preferences and their social inferences as

600
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.719
stemming from some kind of learning, what, what are

601
00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:14.469
they learning from? Uh WHEN we see, you know,

602
00:32:14.479 --> 00:32:16.609
a preference for looking at faces or a preference

603
00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:18.839
for looking at hands in certain situations is that

604
00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:20.305
because they're looking at a lot of hands and

605
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:22.505
faces is that because the faces and hands are

606
00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:25.175
informative in some way. So I started getting excited

607
00:32:25.185 --> 00:32:27.234
about this method that was pioneered by a bunch

608
00:32:27.244 --> 00:32:31.064
of folks, Linda Smith, um Chen Yu, um Karen

609
00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:33.314
Adolf and others where you stick a camera, uh

610
00:32:33.324 --> 00:32:35.214
sometimes an eye tracker, but at least a camera

611
00:32:35.224 --> 00:32:38.165
on the child's head and you measure their visual

612
00:32:38.175 --> 00:32:40.800
environment. And as I was setting up my lab,

613
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:43.479
I started playing with this and it, it was

614
00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:46.319
very exciting to see the child's own viewpoint on

615
00:32:46.329 --> 00:32:49.150
the social world because it looked pretty different than

616
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.270
what I had hypothesized. You know, I was showing

617
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.790
kids videos that looked like, you know, youtube videos,

618
00:32:54.449 --> 00:32:57.000
maybe focused for kids. But basically, you know, like

619
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.369
kind of third person static perspectives. And when you

620
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.430
looked at the first person perspective, uh hands were

621
00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:05.469
huge in the field of view. They were, you

622
00:33:05.479 --> 00:33:07.160
know, kind of coming in from nowhere and putting

623
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.430
an object in the child's uh field of view.

624
00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:11.229
They weren't seeing that many faces because they're down

625
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:12.819
on the ground and the faces are way up

626
00:33:12.829 --> 00:33:15.729
above them and so forth. And so I started

627
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.189
uh working with folks in my lab to build

628
00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:20.540
different kinds of head mounted cameras and try to

629
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:24.630
capture what Children are experiencing. Uh This resulted in

630
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.060
a, a longitudinal study called C CAM, where we

631
00:33:27.069 --> 00:33:30.150
made a corpus of children's early visual experience that's

632
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.430
been really fun to work with uh for machine

633
00:33:32.439 --> 00:33:35.819
learning and computer vision researchers because it documents uh

634
00:33:35.829 --> 00:33:39.189
the changing perspective and social input over the course

635
00:33:39.199 --> 00:33:41.849
of several years for a couple of kids. And

636
00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:44.010
we're currently doing a, a much larger version of

637
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.550
this called the baby View project where we're tracking

638
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.349
uh quite a number of kids with a baby

639
00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:52.449
gopro rigs, basically trying to get this high resolution,

640
00:33:52.459 --> 00:33:55.069
you know, high quality video of what they're experiencing

641
00:33:55.079 --> 00:33:56.040
in their social world.

642
00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.300
And uh what do you think this kind of

643
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:07.839
methodology can add to developmental psychology that perhaps other

644
00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:12.860
more traditional ways of studying child development wouldn't uh

645
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:13.620
give

646
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:17.438
us well, when we're talking about cognitive and linguistic

647
00:34:17.447 --> 00:34:19.668
development, we're talking about things that are happening inside

648
00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:22.228
the head that we can't observe and that's obvious.

649
00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.208
But I think really critically important. And so when

650
00:34:25.217 --> 00:34:28.829
we're trying to triangulate these latent abilities, we really

651
00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:32.110
need to bring a bunch of information to bear

652
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.228
on that, especially when we're talking about learning and

653
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.270
language. Uh WE need to know what the child

654
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.800
is learning from their learning environment and their learning

655
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.668
input. We need to characterize the dynamics of how

656
00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.120
they process that information in the moment. And eye

657
00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:46.989
tracking can be really helpful for that. And then

658
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.228
we need to look at the long term large

659
00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.020
scale outcome. What have they learned? What's their vocabulary

660
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.228
look like? What's their linguistic ability look like more

661
00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.099
broadly? So if you just have one of those

662
00:34:57.108 --> 00:34:59.408
pieces of information, you don't have enough to really

663
00:34:59.418 --> 00:35:01.878
pin down what the nature of the learning process

664
00:35:01.888 --> 00:35:05.178
is. Um But in order to characterize the system,

665
00:35:05.188 --> 00:35:07.509
you, you, you want all of those different pieces

666
00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.989
of information and that's gonna require uh some methodological

667
00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:11.509
innovation.

668
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.040
Mhm So to get into the final topic of

669
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.870
our conversation today, you've also studied a little bit

670
00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:25.949
of parenting attitude. So where do parenting attitudes come

671
00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:26.310
from?

672
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.189
That's a, that's a very hard one. So I'll

673
00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:33.250
start with something a little little easier, which is

674
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.770
that one of the other discoveries that we made

675
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.219
when we looked at children's um language across different

676
00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:44.129
cultures uh was that there was something else that

677
00:35:44.139 --> 00:35:48.050
was consistent beyond the, the tight woven that I

678
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.300
was referring to earlier and that was variability in

679
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.939
every culture we looked at kids were very different

680
00:35:54.949 --> 00:35:58.300
with respect to their path and trajectory into language.

681
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.320
Some kids were going faster, some kids were going

682
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.780
slower. Some kids were learning more grammar, other kids

683
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.169
were learning more single vocabulary items. That voca that

684
00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:11.500
variability is fascinating to people studying early language. And

685
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.340
one of the big goals of early language research

686
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.820
is to get a handle on it, try to

687
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.770
understand its socio-economic roots. It's um genetic roots, it's

688
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:26.350
uh the environmental roots and so forth. And so

689
00:36:26.479 --> 00:36:29.629
measuring language input as we were talking about, you

690
00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.270
know, using recordings or head mounted cameras is important

691
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.100
there. Uh BUT it's also important to try to

692
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:38.000
get a sense of what kind of home environment

693
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.189
the child is in. And so hence an interest

694
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:46.860
in parenting attitudes and uh folks um theories of

695
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.179
what it means to parent or interact with, with

696
00:36:49.189 --> 00:36:52.199
kids. So that, that, that was the broad motivation

697
00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:55.260
for studying parenting attitudes. Uh Many people have, have

698
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.570
studied parenting from a lot of different lenses. We,

699
00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.919
we developed a questionnaire on this as, as one

700
00:36:59.929 --> 00:37:03.659
entry into this much broader, more complex space. And

701
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.580
are, you know, I I an earlier observation, I

702
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.149
made kind of motivates this, there are some cultures

703
00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:12.560
that where you get a real deep focus on

704
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.600
kids and their development and providing them with really,

705
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.510
you know, um educational opportunities even before school. And

706
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.479
there are other cultures where you don't see that

707
00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:23.409
as much. And so we were interested in measuring

708
00:37:23.419 --> 00:37:26.479
cultural and also individual variation on that dimension. Do

709
00:37:26.489 --> 00:37:28.800
parents think it's their job to teach their kids

710
00:37:29.379 --> 00:37:31.419
or the kids supposed to mostly be learning to

711
00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:33.929
be respectful and, you know, kind of good members

712
00:37:33.939 --> 00:37:35.919
of the community and it's not about teaching them

713
00:37:35.929 --> 00:37:38.280
words or teaching them the precursors of math or

714
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.959
reading to them and so forth. So, uh that

715
00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:44.000
was the goal of our parenting attitude questionnaire. And,

716
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.040
and we did find some evidence for individual variation

717
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.179
on this dimension. Um And of course, folks around

718
00:37:50.189 --> 00:37:52.780
the world are interested in, in parenting variation. So

719
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.199
we've gotten a lot of uptick people translating these

720
00:37:55.209 --> 00:37:58.860
questionnaires and using them in different places. Uh I,

721
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.780
I think it's too soon to say whether we

722
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.010
know what the universal dimensions of parenting are. That's,

723
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.090
that's a pretty uh strong um kind of set

724
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.620
of claims. But, but we're starting to understand that,

725
00:38:10.629 --> 00:38:12.919
that there are these some dimensions of variation that

726
00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:14.540
are important across a couple of cultures.

727
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:21.050
But even if we don't still have that understanding

728
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.030
about those dimensions of attitude and how they vary

729
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.149
cross culturally. Do we have any idea about where

730
00:38:31.429 --> 00:38:34.320
uh parenting attitudes come from?

731
00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:41.159
Um I was dodging that question because it's hard.

732
00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:45.919
I it's, yeah, it, so culture, right. So um

733
00:38:45.929 --> 00:38:48.840
we have a broad complex of cultural ideas about

734
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.129
what parents do and what parents role is. Uh

735
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.949
And in the US, especially, but also in Europe,

736
00:38:56.959 --> 00:38:59.209
to a certain extent, we have, you know, as

737
00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:01.689
Alison Gopnik and others have written about um we've

738
00:39:01.699 --> 00:39:04.219
come to this idea that parenting is an active

739
00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:06.620
activity that we engage in. And it's part of

740
00:39:06.629 --> 00:39:09.290
a process of concerted cultivation of our kids for

741
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.820
success. And that's quite different than an alternative theory

742
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.969
where maybe uh you have to take care of

743
00:39:15.979 --> 00:39:18.870
your kids and it's important to teach them respect.

744
00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:22.120
But then the kind of education uh and formation

745
00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:24.260
of the kids is part of the educational system,

746
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.989
for example, you send them somewhere. So uh those

747
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.600
two different mindsets uh seem like they're kind of

748
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.770
culturally ingrained and have emerged, you know, uh especially

749
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.820
in the US over the post war period or,

750
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.260
you know, social mobility desires for kind of uh

751
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.959
increased engagement, um decreasing birth rates, there's a kind

752
00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:47.500
of a whole set of, you know, important cultural

753
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.850
dynamics that lead to us, us to value the

754
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.229
outcomes of individual kids, especially in, you know, middle

755
00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:54.800
and higher ses families.

756
00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.340
Mhm. Uh And so one last question, then do

757
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:05.949
we know if beliefs about parenting attitudes actually translate

758
00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:08.530
into parenting behaviors

759
00:40:10.409 --> 00:40:13.139
that I think we're at early days for understanding

760
00:40:13.149 --> 00:40:17.030
exactly how that happens. So it's clear that uh

761
00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:18.790
you know, at the, at the edges like the,

762
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.860
the more extreme cases, uh there are real differences

763
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.479
in the ways that parents act, they, in terms

764
00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:27.030
of, you know, the language that they produce for

765
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.070
kids, but also the, the kinds of, um I

766
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.629
amount of engagement and the richness of the the

767
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:37.250
home environment. Um THE amount that parents are preparing

768
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.280
their kids for an educational path versus the amount

769
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.989
that they're feeling their responsibility, more cultural to pass

770
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.439
on cultural traditions versus the amount they're engaging at

771
00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:48.429
all. Uh So, so it's clear that, you know,

772
00:40:48.439 --> 00:40:51.350
from that perspective, from an intuitive perspective, attitudes are

773
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.850
translating into action. How much does our questionnaire particularly

774
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.830
measure that? Well, we did a little bit of

775
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.229
initial validity work to try to uh test whether

776
00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:05.649
parents reports of their attitudes matched parents reports of

777
00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:10.219
their actual activities and, and they did, but really

778
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:14.949
validating uh in the most, you know, thorough way

779
00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:18.590
to really understand whether parents implicit theories of what

780
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.429
it means to be a parent, really translate day

781
00:41:20.439 --> 00:41:22.729
to day into their observed actions and behaviors. I

782
00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:25.270
think that work, you know, uh from a measurement

783
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.899
perspective still needs to be ongoing.

784
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.520
Mhm. So Doctor Frank, just before we go, would

785
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.050
you like to tell people where they can find

786
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.199
you and your work on the internet?

787
00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:39.330
Oh, thanks for the opportunity. Yeah. Yeah. So if,

788
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.479
if folks want to engage more um I Twitter

789
00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:46.290
or X as it's now called, have become a

790
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.469
really good platform for engaging with scientists. And I,

791
00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:50.139
I do try to engage there. It's a lot

792
00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:54.030
of fun. Um Also uh if you're interested in

793
00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.590
any of the resources that we create, because that's,

794
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.330
that's very much what, what we do is create

795
00:41:59.459 --> 00:42:02.169
open resources for studying child development. I encourage you

796
00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:04.780
to take a look at our labs website, Lang

797
00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:08.879
cog.stanford.edu um which provides links to some of the

798
00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:11.929
studies and resources that I've described, including Word Bank,

799
00:42:11.969 --> 00:42:15.550
um which you can Google uh word bank.stanford.edu. Uh

800
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.689
And that's, that's a really fun resource for exploring

801
00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:20.149
child language. And uh so, so encourage you to,

802
00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:21.909
to take a look at all of those platforms

803
00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:23.639
and, and play with some of the uh tools

804
00:42:23.649 --> 00:42:24.860
and data sets that we've created.

805
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.370
Great. So I'm leaving links to that in the

806
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:31.959
