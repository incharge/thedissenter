00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.019
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.099 --> 00:00:06.000
Center. I'm your host as always, Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.779
today I'm joined by Doctor Elizabeth Pilsner. She is

4
00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.920
Professor of Anthropology at California State University. Fullerton her

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.319
research questions include patterns of mate preferences, mate choice,

6
00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.629
sexuality, gender, romantic love and reproduction. And today we're

7
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.450
going to talk about the Shuar uh which is

8
00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:33.200
basically a group of hunter horticultural people in South

9
00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:37.930
America, uh partner choice and marital practices, parent offspring,

10
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:43.799
conflict made preferences, parental investment, coupling, women, sexual strategies

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.000
and some other related topics. So, Doctor Pills. Wor

12
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.169
welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.919
Thank you. Thank you for inviting me. I'm really

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.770
happy to be here.

15
00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.439
So tell us about the shoar who, who are

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.080
these people. And uh I mean, tell us a

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.879
little bit about their society generally.

18
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:07.250
Sure. Well, first, one of the things that you

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.230
should know is that they are one of many

20
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:15.489
indigenous nationalities in South America and particularly in Ecuador.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.160
The Shuar uh live both in Ecuador and in

22
00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:23.779
Peru. They are in Ecuador, the second largest indigenous

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.760
nation. So there's approximately 100 and 10,000 by some

24
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:32.779
estimates. So are people living today um across three

25
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.769
different provinces in Ecuador? And as I said on

26
00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:39.919
into Peru, um They have uh a so when

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.580
we say that they are hunter horticulturalists. So first

28
00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:45.419
of all, for your viewers who may not know

29
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.430
those terms, um horticulture, so we, we can talk

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.660
about subsistence strategies um that differ in terms of

31
00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:57.599
how much we're relying on resources that occur naturally

32
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.449
in the environment and how much we're producing resources.

33
00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.160
So hunter gatherers get all of their resources from

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.940
resources that are occurring naturally in the environment that

35
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.000
are not cultivating plants as a general rule. They

36
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:18.389
are not domesticating animals or keeping animals. Um Hunter

37
00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:25.149
horticulturalists specific uh uh rely on hunting primarily for

38
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.059
protein sources. Um And horticulture means that they are

39
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.259
not just gathering, although they do a lot of

40
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.830
gathering in the rainforest, but they are also cultivating

41
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:40.520
plants. So the women maintain gardens. Their primary crops

42
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.850
are uh manio sweet manioc, not bitter manio, which

43
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.610
requires a lot more processing um plantain, uh and

44
00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:56.009
AAA variety of other plants that they grow through

45
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.449
planting, through propagating through even sharing. They have vast

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.479
networks of uh um sharing networks of the props

47
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.529
that they use for their, their plants for by

48
00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:12.210
one of my colleagues, Doctor Brenda Bowser. Um So

49
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.210
they, there's a very strong interdependence between men and

50
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.110
women. Um IN terms of uh resource acquisition, in

51
00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:28.089
terms of subsistence, uh the family organization. One of

52
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.250
the things that you should know about the Shaar

53
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.369
also is that they really have a very recent

54
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.539
history of acculturation as recently as the 19 fifties

55
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.839
and 19 sixties. Prior to that, um the Schwar

56
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.589
didn't live in settled communities really at all. They

57
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.570
lived in independent households throughout the rainforest. Um And

58
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.720
they uh had alliances amongst these individual households, generally

59
00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.210
individual men. Um And so these alliances could be

60
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.110
due to kinship or uh uh reciprocal relationships. Um

61
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.009
And the households typically were composed of AAA man

62
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.789
with his wife or wives. Um And I'll get

63
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.950
back to that in just a second. Um And

64
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.019
their Children and possibly uh a New son-in-law um

65
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:26.829
or two might be around. Um So in terms

66
00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:30.809
of numbers of wives, if we look at the

67
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.119
earlier ethnography of the Schwar, we look at uh

68
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.410
historical accounts from Schwar community members themselves in the

69
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.850
very recent past, again, a as recently as in

70
00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:46.929
the 19 fifties and sixties. And really up until

71
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.399
um nearly the 21st century, the Schwar could be

72
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.239
characterized as most men had 2 to 3 wives.

73
00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:04.089
Um So this is an interesting figure, right? Because

74
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.369
if we expect that on average populations have relatively

75
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.140
equal numbers of males and females, if we have

76
00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:15.459
a majority of males having 2 to 3 wives,

77
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.619
that means mathematically, we have a lot more women

78
00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:22.380
than we do men approximately 2 to 3 times

79
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.339
as many women as we do men. Um And

80
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.820
the reason for this was that in uh historic

81
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.049
shore communities, there's a really high rate of inter

82
00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:40.029
individual and intergroup violence, very high rate of homicide,

83
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.140
one of the highest homicide rates on the planet

84
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.670
even today, although fortunately, it's reduced substantially. Um But

85
00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:54.109
that is the, the traditional context, as I said,

86
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.190
this really didn't start to change very much at

87
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.130
all until about the 19 fifties and sixties. At

88
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.779
which time the show started to, uh, concentrate into

89
00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:09.559
cros into communities, um, which could range in size

90
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.920
from just a couple of households to up to

91
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.880
several 100 individuals. Um Although those larger sizes really

92
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.429
more recently, um And this was in part, in

93
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.679
order to provide, um, themselves with political protection, um,

94
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.690
and the ability to, uh, interact with the, um,

95
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:37.309
Ecuadorian government. Um And so that's the context in

96
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.670
which the Shuar have been living for the past,

97
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.670
um, half century plus, I lose track of the

98
00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:50.329
dates. I think it's still like 1988 or something.

99
00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:58.049
And so, uh, so now they live primarily in,

100
00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:02.390
in Centros. Um, THEY still practice to some extent

101
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.730
polygamy, but the rates of polygamy are declining substantially.

102
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.890
Um And, uh, but they still primarily subsist with

103
00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:16.549
hunting and horticulture. Women still produce the bulk of

104
00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:20.190
the food that people eat every day. Hunting is

105
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.850
becoming scarcer and harder to really sustain. So we

106
00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:30.089
see a lot more wage labor. Um, WHETHER that's

107
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.470
through contract labor or through salaried positions. Um A

108
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.589
lot of men in the villages where I work

109
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.910
in the communities where I work um are actually

110
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.750
employed as teachers. Um AND a growing number of

111
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.589
women as well. Um And that's a uh a

112
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.589
government paid job. So it's a very reliable income.

113
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.799
Um And, and so we're seeing these kinds of

114
00:07:55.809 --> 00:08:00.640
economic changes which then also changes the ways that

115
00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:04.519
people contribute to the household. Um But we'll get

116
00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:07.309
into that probably more further down.

117
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.190
Sure. Sure. Uh So, yeah, le let's try to

118
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.230
keep some of the aspects that you mentioned there

119
00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:19.720
in mind when exploring some specific aspects of their

120
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.480
society. But uh OK, so among all of that,

121
00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:28.739
what are the aspects of their society, their sociality

122
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.200
that you've studied the most or focus the most

123
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:32.359
on?

124
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.200
Yeah. So my primary area of study is related

125
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:43.400
to reproductive and mating strategies. So that includes uh

126
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.719
uh studying the both the traditional and the current

127
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:54.000
um marriage norms and behavior, sexual norms and behavior

128
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.479
and parenting norms and behavior. Um I have done

129
00:08:58.489 --> 00:09:03.500
quite a bit of uh research on mate preferences

130
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.440
and in fact, I'll a little bit later, I'll

131
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.799
tell you about the follow up study. I'm doing

132
00:09:07.809 --> 00:09:11.520
uh working on um getting, gosh, it's now like

133
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.179
20 year follow up data on people I interviewed

134
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.359
when they were unmarried. Um As part of my

135
00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:24.080
dissertation research. Um So that's it, it's gonna be

136
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.659
really cool because looking at how their mate preferences

137
00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:30.270
actually played out, uh I'm, I have uh recently

138
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.320
been focusing on parent offspring, conflict and mating decisions

139
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.640
as well as women's uh mating and reproductive strategies.

140
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.059
What are the choices that, that they're making? What

141
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.780
are the strategies that they're utilizing? Um AND also

142
00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:49.609
reproductive behavior in general. So in terms of things

143
00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:53.210
like the utilization of birth control or other forms

144
00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:58.309
of traditional family planning, um the nursing behaviors, weaning

145
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.390
behaviors, and pregnancy and childbirth, um norms and behaviors.

146
00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:07.549
So those are, those are the main things that,

147
00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:11.940
that I've been studying other things that, that I

148
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.140
don't have much sys or any systematic data on.

149
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.900
But I pay a lot of attention to while

150
00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:22.340
doing field work because I'm really deeply interested in

151
00:10:22.349 --> 00:10:25.940
them are issues related to the sexual division of

152
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.739
labor, gender norms, um perceptions of sexuality in particular,

153
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:38.710
in terms of uh perceptions of uh sexuality diversity

154
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.599
um including LGBT Q plus issues and women's lives

155
00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:47.760
in general. Um All the things that women do

156
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.030
and the struggles and challenges and, and, and powers

157
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:55.039
that they have all of those things um and

158
00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:57.059
cultural change. So those are some of the things

159
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.830
that I pay attention to but haven't really collected

160
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.830
any data on. Mhm uh

161
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.229
So we're going to get more into that later

162
00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:08.840
on. But uh I, I mean, just for a

163
00:11:08.849 --> 00:11:12.690
brief question about all of what you said there

164
00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:17.799
when it comes to the gender norms specifically, uh

165
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.239
with the economic changes that you described there, have

166
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:29.039
you seen uh any, I mean, important uh differences

167
00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:33.200
over time in terms of how gender norms might

168
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.599
have changed?

169
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.250
Yeah. So, I mean, I don't know that I

170
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.080
would even go so far as to say gender

171
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.369
norms have changed. But certainly in terms of, for

172
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.570
example, I think that the idea of what makes

173
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:56.179
men, men and what makes women women um is

174
00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.250
still pretty similar to what people have described to

175
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.409
me from the past. Um AND what I've read

176
00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:13.299
from the past, um but what's changed is in

177
00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:19.179
particular, what's expected in terms of rights for women,

178
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.390
what women can are allowed to do are, are,

179
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.580
are, are, are, what's the word I'm looking for

180
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:33.859
um are owed essentially as humans, right? Not as

181
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.619
anything, it some special category, but just that, that,

182
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.380
that, you know, this idea of women's rights really

183
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.590
has changed. So if we look at, you know,

184
00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:56.409
schwar traditional practices, um they're very, it, it, it,

185
00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:59.880
it's, it's an, it was an extremely patriarchal society.

186
00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:07.770
Um MEN absolutely dominated in terms of both with

187
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:14.590
physical domination, right? So beating of women was common,

188
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.919
men absolutely controlled women with force and Children as

189
00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:25.679
well. Um And women weren't, did not have any

190
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:31.099
explicitly or very little I should say explicitly recognized

191
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.770
influence. Now, of course, as women do in all

192
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.039
places and in all times this is not to

193
00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:40.640
say that women were passive or that they had

194
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.179
no power or influence it. One of the things

195
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.719
that I have written about a little bit is

196
00:13:47.729 --> 00:13:53.229
women's uh the, the sources of resistance that are

197
00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:55.919
available to women as well as the areas in

198
00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:59.239
which they are able to exert influence in which

199
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.179
they're able to shape the society uh as, as

200
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.520
well. It's just that those things are much more

201
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:14.909
under uh uh uh what's what I'm, what, how

202
00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:17.590
am I trying to say that? Um MUCH less

203
00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:24.590
explicit, much less um publicly recognized um undercover a

204
00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:29.159
little bit. Um So that has, has changed quite

205
00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.549
a bit, right. The there has been a, a

206
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:36.479
substantial increase in education for everybody across the board,

207
00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:40.880
but particularly for girls and women. So of the

208
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:47.460
women approximately my age. So I'm 50 ish my

209
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:50.359
age in the shore communities, most of them have

210
00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:55.219
about a third grade education. Um And a lot

211
00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.960
of them my age are a little bit older

212
00:14:57.969 --> 00:15:02.780
are illiterate. Um However, if you look at women

213
00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:06.059
just a little bit younger than me. So we're

214
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.909
looking at women in their forties, in their thirties,

215
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.260
we're seeing gradual increases in the amount of education

216
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.130
to, at that, to, at this point, most girls

217
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.789
are staying in school through the completion of high

218
00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:25.369
school. Um And many are going on to college.

219
00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:29.229
Um So that has been a huge change again,

220
00:15:29.349 --> 00:15:31.789
that's been in some ways across the board. So

221
00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:35.799
boys have also been doing more schooling. Um BUT

222
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:38.130
the effect is much more dramatic in terms of

223
00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.250
girls and this has very, very huge impacts on

224
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.400
how their lives unfold. So again, when we're talking

225
00:15:48.409 --> 00:15:51.190
about, and I, and I reference my own age

226
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.169
because this is, again, it's just to me, it's

227
00:15:53.179 --> 00:16:00.190
so significant how recent this history is that again,

228
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.390
women, my age, almost all of them were married

229
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.369
by the age of 12 without having had any

230
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.020
say in that marriage without having any expectation of

231
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.530
it. There. You know, the story that's told to

232
00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:21.070
me again and again is I was out, you

233
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.090
know, doing playing or doing whatever, working in the

234
00:16:25.099 --> 00:16:27.770
garden, my parents called me and said, you're gonna

235
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.150
marry this guy. And what? Um AND so that's

236
00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:34.770
so recently. So that's, that's all the women my

237
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.659
age. Um But now the girls are mostly at

238
00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:42.809
least finishing high school. So that's pushing back that

239
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.260
age of marriage a little bit. Surprisingly, the actual

240
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.880
age of marriage hasn't changed. Average age of marriage

241
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.150
hasn't changed that much in my sample over the

242
00:16:55.159 --> 00:17:00.229
years. But in part, that's because there's some outliers

243
00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:03.760
at both ends. So amongst the older women, there's

244
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.280
my sample sizes are so small right in my,

245
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.449
the community where I've collected the most data where

246
00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:15.050
I collected complete uh uh marital and pregnancy histories

247
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.489
of, of all the women in that community that

248
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.709
sample size was, uh, let me look. I think

249
00:17:20.719 --> 00:17:24.189
I had, hold on a second. I'll tell you

250
00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:32.859
exactly. 20. Um, NO, it was 30 in, in

251
00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:36.449
total 30 married women and one unmarried woman. So

252
00:17:36.459 --> 00:17:39.859
that's, you know, that's my sample size. So I

253
00:17:39.869 --> 00:17:43.010
have of the older cohort, most of them are

254
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.510
getting married, as I said at around 12 or

255
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.949
13. But then there's one woman who got married,

256
00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:52.839
didn't get married really at all until she was

257
00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:55.180
in her late into her, into her twenties. So

258
00:17:55.189 --> 00:17:58.709
she was fully adulthood at that point. Um And

259
00:17:58.719 --> 00:18:01.810
that pulls that average up and then amongst my

260
00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:04.729
younger cohort, you know, the average age is closer

261
00:18:04.739 --> 00:18:08.489
to 17 or 18. Um But there's a few

262
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.420
who ran off and got married at 13. Um

263
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.449
So when you look at the average, it doesn't

264
00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:17.540
look like there's been that much change, but there,

265
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.969
there really has if you're looking at the uh

266
00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:23.489
the median um changes pretty significantly.

267
00:18:24.699 --> 00:18:28.560
So we'll come back to gender roles later in

268
00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:32.439
our conversation, but just to follow perhaps a sort

269
00:18:32.449 --> 00:18:36.619
of a script here. So starting with uh partner

270
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:41.680
choices and mari marital practices. So, uh how do

271
00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:48.489
partner choices work in? Sure society, I mean, who

272
00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:54.119
uh chooses there, who does the choices? Uh And

273
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.420
uh I mean, how does marriage look like? Of

274
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.280
course, you mentioned earlier that uh at least until

275
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:09.810
recently, historically speaking, most marriages were polygamous, polygynous specifically,

276
00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:12.459
right? So but uh uh we can get into

277
00:19:12.469 --> 00:19:16.160
how that changed over time, but tell us first

278
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.859
about partner choice.

279
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.130
Yeah. So again, I always have to, whenever I'm

280
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:29.189
describing anything in terms of our relationship practices, I

281
00:19:29.199 --> 00:19:31.810
do have to sort of make this comment, I

282
00:19:31.819 --> 00:19:37.050
talk about traditionally, which was pretty recently and today,

283
00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:43.780
so traditionally, partner choice was almost entirely a negotiation

284
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.660
between men. Um What would typically happen is, so,

285
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.420
remember I said that people mostly were living in

286
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.540
independent households, not in communities and a man would

287
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.089
come of age, which when I say of age

288
00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:03.859
would have been about 1516, 17 ish. Uh And

289
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:09.319
he would go out in search of a potential

290
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.260
wives. Um And if in he, you know, and

291
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.410
he very well might have information from kin or

292
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.760
other people he knows. Um But he also might

293
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:25.930
literally have just gone out searching um if he

294
00:20:25.939 --> 00:20:32.780
finds a AAA girl, and again, traditionally, girls might

295
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.430
have been married off very in childhood. Um They

296
00:20:37.439 --> 00:20:41.729
were not expected to engage in any sexual behavior

297
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:46.579
at the before the onset of Menzies anyway. Um

298
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.949
But they might be married off at childhood even

299
00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:56.339
in infancy. Again, in terms of uh uh because

300
00:20:56.349 --> 00:20:59.180
these relationships were negotiated between men and they were

301
00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:04.270
these alliances between men. Sometimes the father would promise

302
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.310
his future daughters even so some girls would be

303
00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:14.069
married even before they were born. Um And uh

304
00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:16.500
and so basically, so the young man would be

305
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.130
out looking for potential brides. If he found one

306
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.619
that he, he thought was appropriate, he would approach

307
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.689
her father. Um And it was so traditionally, also,

308
00:21:30.699 --> 00:21:39.010
the Schwar had a very um uh ritualized form

309
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.689
of greeting and meeting when you approached another man's

310
00:21:43.699 --> 00:21:47.969
house, um that's referred to as strong talking where

311
00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:53.900
the men would partially threaten one another, partially uh

312
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.910
give their genealogy to, you know, to situate their

313
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.449
relatedness or, or their, their network connections. Um And

314
00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:09.959
this was then when it was concluded, it, well,

315
00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:11.989
the indication that was concluded is in the, the

316
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.390
man of the house would call to his wife

317
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.829
to bring Chica. Um So sorry, I'm giving another

318
00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:23.630
side. Um Chica is manio beer. I will come

319
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.849
back to it later, but for now, just say

320
00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:31.829
it's very important to show our cultural practices. Um

321
00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:35.109
And women are in charge of making chica and

322
00:22:35.119 --> 00:22:40.680
having chica, but men control to whom it's given.

323
00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:47.209
And when, um traditionally, so, uh the son, the,

324
00:22:47.219 --> 00:22:49.680
the potential son-in-law would make his case to the

325
00:22:49.689 --> 00:22:54.969
potential father-in-law. He would go hunting, bring some game

326
00:22:54.979 --> 00:23:01.869
back. Now, there are descriptions in the earlier ethnography

327
00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:09.949
um that the daughter herself would basically signal her

328
00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:12.920
acceptance of this young man when she would cook

329
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.489
the food and bring it to him. Um, IN

330
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:24.119
my experience in my interviews with women, um I

331
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:29.719
do not get the sense that they had much

332
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:35.430
room for choosing not to serve the man food.

333
00:23:35.729 --> 00:23:39.680
Um, AND in fact, I, I have many stories

334
00:23:39.689 --> 00:23:43.479
of women and their conflicts with their parents of

335
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:48.900
either them running away and their parents retrieving them,

336
00:23:49.239 --> 00:23:54.000
um, or them refusing and their parents forcing them.

337
00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:57.170
Um, AGAIN of the women in my sample where

338
00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.280
I have these full marital histories. Um, ONLY one

339
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.959
of those who had an, whose, whose parents chose

340
00:24:05.969 --> 00:24:08.780
her, her, her partner, only one of them said

341
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.349
she actually came to agree to it before they

342
00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:19.270
were married. Um So I don't know, um how

343
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.199
much leeway girls had in the past, but I

344
00:24:23.209 --> 00:24:28.410
would bet not a whole lot. Um Again, girls

345
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.589
and their mothers might have had some influence if

346
00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:38.430
they had strong uh uh reasons against this person.

347
00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:43.589
Um But in the end, fathers basically made the

348
00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:45.719
decision. So

349
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.400
let me just ask you one question because you're

350
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:55.660
already uh mentioning how much power uh the parents

351
00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.569
of the women have over their partner choices. But

352
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:05.579
what about the parents of the men? Did they

353
00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:08.219
also play a role there or not?

354
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.569
No, no, not at all. No, no, no. This

355
00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:16.510
is entirely a negotiation between a potential son in

356
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.300
law and a potential father in law. And this

357
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:24.949
was very much about them forming an alliance. So

358
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:28.540
again, there were very high rates of intra and

359
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.569
intergroup warfare. Um So having allies was really important.

360
00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:38.930
Now, man might be able to also get another

361
00:25:38.939 --> 00:25:41.530
ally via his son in law. So it could

362
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.260
be that, you know, if he, if he gets

363
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.780
his son in law and maybe his son-in-law, his

364
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.010
potential son-in-law's dad is very powerful and then he

365
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.209
has sort of an ally through that. But the

366
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:58.280
parents of the sons really didn't have much to

367
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:03.699
do with this. Um Except to the extent that

368
00:26:03.709 --> 00:26:06.729
again, that might be part of those negotiations. So

369
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:10.520
let's say for example, that the um a young

370
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.780
man comes looking for a, a wife. Um IF

371
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:19.939
he has sisters and I have as the dad,

372
00:26:19.949 --> 00:26:22.890
I have sons, right? That might be part of

373
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.050
the negotiation that, you know, I'll give you my

374
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.939
daughter, but you need to give me one of

375
00:26:28.949 --> 00:26:32.369
your sisters for one of my sons. Um So

376
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.650
to that extent, uh they might have some influence

377
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.170
in it, but generally other than that, no real

378
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.170
decision making.

379
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.859
Ok. Uh And, but when it comes to marriage,

380
00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:47.540
since at the very beginning, you mentioned that uh

381
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:53.660
most marriages were polygynous, I mean, between a man

382
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.439
and two or three women. Uh I mean, I

383
00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:00.810
was trying to understand because of course, uh it

384
00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:05.500
seems that status also played a role in sure

385
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:09.349
society, right? I mean, the status of the particular

386
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:14.420
man who is making uh a marriage offer to

387
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.819
the father of the woman they uh he, he

388
00:27:17.829 --> 00:27:21.689
wants to marry. Uh So, uh I mean, how,

389
00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:26.050
how does that work? Exactly? Because if, if most,

390
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.339
I'm not sure what percentage we're talking about here.

391
00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:33.109
But if you say that most marriages were between

392
00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:36.020
one man and two or three women. Uh I

393
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:41.920
mean, uh how low in the social ranking, let's

394
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:46.189
say, would people, would the father of the uh

395
00:27:46.199 --> 00:27:49.910
the woman be willing to go when uh accepting

396
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.390
uh an offer? Because I, I mean, it couldn't

397
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.750
be that like, I don't know, for example. Yeah,

398
00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.030
I, I'm just putting a number out there. 70%

399
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.810
of men were uh high ranking,

400
00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:07.920
right? So it, it, I don't think you, you

401
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.680
can really think of it in terms of this

402
00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:17.800
hierarchical ranking. Um BECAUSE again, they were organized into

403
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:24.560
a community. So it's really about individual warrior. Um

404
00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:28.760
And so there's very little, well, you know, again,

405
00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:33.839
knowing that somebody has a powerful shaman as a

406
00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:37.739
father or a powerful warrior as a father is

407
00:28:38.109 --> 00:28:44.069
important information, but it's not like there's inherited status

408
00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:50.869
rankings. Um And being the son of a, of

409
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.540
a formidable warrior doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a

410
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.079
formidable warrior and your status will be based on

411
00:28:58.089 --> 00:29:01.829
your warrior. Um And that's really where this w

412
00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:06.160
what's determining status is, you know, really, we can

413
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.270
think about it almost very directly as a warrior

414
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.510
ship um to use John Patton's uh terms for,

415
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.469
you know, how he worked in a neighboring population.

416
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.650
Um So not the Schwar but the Achuar um

417
00:29:23.369 --> 00:29:26.989
who actually the two, these two na nationalities were

418
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.239
very much warring with one another as well. So

419
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.660
they both, both of them experienced intra group warfare,

420
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.089
but also between these two groups, particularly very high

421
00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:42.859
rates of warfare. Um And so, yeah, so status

422
00:29:42.869 --> 00:29:46.920
was really very much about one's prowess, um, in

423
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.599
terms of, of warriors and this was displayed by,

424
00:29:51.609 --> 00:29:54.780
you know, one of the, uh features that the

425
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:58.400
Schwar have been well known for is that they

426
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.000
are the ones who, who made shrunken heads santa.

427
00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:08.160
Um And that was really how a man could.

428
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.349
Well, here are the ways that he could indicate

429
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:13.550
his status, the number of salsa, he had the

430
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.859
number of wives he had and the amount of

431
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.109
chica he had. Um THOSE were, those are the

432
00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:23.410
big ones. Um There were other many other things

433
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.140
as well, but those, those were the really big

434
00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:27.810
status markers.

435
00:30:28.089 --> 00:30:31.829
So you've already mentioned Chi twice. So what is

436
00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:32.130
that?

437
00:30:33.189 --> 00:30:36.660
So, Chica Chico is incredibly important. It is, as

438
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.930
I said, it's, it's, it's actually manio beer. So

439
00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:42.229
it's uh a fermented drink made with this sweet

440
00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:51.339
manioc root. Um And it is the core both

441
00:30:51.349 --> 00:31:03.339
food beverage and social uh context. So, you know,

442
00:31:03.349 --> 00:31:07.599
it's really created all the social contexts. So Chica

443
00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:10.579
is really, it's really complicated i in talking about

444
00:31:10.589 --> 00:31:12.329
it's simple to describe, it's, it's, you know, it's

445
00:31:12.339 --> 00:31:16.729
fermented maniac beer, which is made by Mashing. I

446
00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:20.699
have made Chica several times. Mashing the manioc um

447
00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:25.219
chewing the uh the hard uh roots of the,

448
00:31:25.229 --> 00:31:27.800
that's the sort of vein of the manioc chewing

449
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:32.280
that spitting that back in stirring it all together.

450
00:31:32.329 --> 00:31:36.050
Um Mashing chewing, spitting, mashing chewing, spitting all that.

451
00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.030
Um And then you let it ferment. Um AND

452
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.469
it can be, it can range dramatically in alcohol

453
00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:48.020
content. There's very sort of everyday weak chica and

454
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:53.420
there's much stronger chica for parties or for guests.

455
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.530
Um Children drink chica Chica is, I mean, traditionally

456
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.819
that was the staple food. Um And I was,

457
00:32:01.829 --> 00:32:04.880
when I talked to my friends in short communities

458
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.959
whose only experience with beer is this very sort

459
00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:13.069
of watered down Pilsner, that's the National Beer of

460
00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:16.670
Ecuador. And I tell them that beer is my

461
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.849
people's chica. And I tell them the history and

462
00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:23.550
I'm like, no really in Northern Europe beer in

463
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.469
the, you know, in, in, in the middle ages,

464
00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:28.089
beer was food. It was how you saved your

465
00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:30.459
grains. And this is the same thing. It's, you

466
00:32:30.469 --> 00:32:32.479
know, that's the way that they can keep that,

467
00:32:32.489 --> 00:32:36.630
that uh those, those roots um and keep them

468
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.479
from rotting. Um So it, it, it serves very

469
00:32:40.489 --> 00:32:43.540
much the same. And then as I said, it's

470
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:48.839
also because it's incredibly labor intensive to produce. So

471
00:32:48.849 --> 00:32:52.349
first, there's, and all of the, all of the

472
00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:55.819
labor that goes into making chica, all of it

473
00:32:55.949 --> 00:32:59.060
is women's work with the one exception of clearing

474
00:32:59.069 --> 00:33:02.430
the gardens originally. So again, we're in primary rainforest

475
00:33:02.439 --> 00:33:06.270
here. Men usually clear out the garden. Um But

476
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.729
women plant the yuca, they harvest the yuca, which

477
00:33:09.739 --> 00:33:13.250
is quite difficult to pull these big tuber roots

478
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:17.369
up out of the ground. They transport the yuca

479
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.089
in jungin. These are baskets that are, you know,

480
00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:25.410
like £50 of yuca root in them that they

481
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.640
carry on their heads. Um Not on their heads

482
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.550
with a strap around their head, on their back.

483
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.010
Um Washing that, then they have to boil it,

484
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:39.439
they peeling it, peeling. It is a whole activity

485
00:33:39.449 --> 00:33:42.660
in and of itself. Um And the show women

486
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.349
take, they have their machetes and they're just like

487
00:33:45.739 --> 00:33:48.630
peeling and, you know, I almost cut my hand

488
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.819
off several times. Um I am not very competent

489
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.630
at this. Um And then, you know, the boiling

490
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.400
it, the mashing and the chewing and, and this

491
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:03.420
takes all afternoon to do um just the, the

492
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.050
making of the che itself, not the, you know,

493
00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:10.197
harvesting and et cetera, et cetera. So it's incredibly

494
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:14.418
time and labor intensive. Um And it's all women's

495
00:34:14.428 --> 00:34:19.039
labor, which is why Chica is such a good

496
00:34:19.289 --> 00:34:24.279
indicator of a man's status, right? So men's status

497
00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:28.248
relies on chica, the more chica he has the

498
00:34:28.259 --> 00:34:31.118
better the chica is, the quicker women are able

499
00:34:31.128 --> 00:34:34.539
to bring the chica out. Um You know, it,

500
00:34:34.549 --> 00:34:37.498
the fact that he has enough on hand that

501
00:34:37.509 --> 00:34:41.138
he doesn't run out. Um All of that is

502
00:34:41.148 --> 00:34:45.148
a measure of his status So, it's, it's really

503
00:34:45.158 --> 00:34:48.039
interesting how much, you know, this, this thing that's

504
00:34:48.049 --> 00:34:54.639
entirely produced by women is this massive component of

505
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:55.659
men's status,

506
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.739
by the way, does it taste good? How does

507
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:04.459
it, how does it compare to other common alcoholic

508
00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:06.939
beverages in, in the west? For example.

509
00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:10.760
Well, it's quite a bit chunkier as a general

510
00:35:10.899 --> 00:35:13.955
rule. So it is, it's thick and it's, you

511
00:35:13.965 --> 00:35:15.824
know, it's usually got quite a lot of fibers

512
00:35:15.834 --> 00:35:18.514
in it. Although usually when women serve it, they,

513
00:35:18.524 --> 00:35:22.094
they wring out the fibers so it'll be mostly

514
00:35:22.104 --> 00:35:24.235
liquidy, but it can be still quite, quite thick

515
00:35:24.245 --> 00:35:29.060
and fairly fibrous. Um It is, it's kind of

516
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:33.070
sour. Um I admit that the first couple times

517
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.479
I tried it, I didn't like it that much.

518
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.270
Um But now I actually, it's like I crave

519
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.409
it and I get so I, when I go

520
00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.449
back to Ecuador and I'm like, can I have

521
00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:45.120
some chica in it? The chica? It's so good.

522
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.409
Um And then, you know that we've been doing

523
00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:49.620
so a lot of people recently have been starting

524
00:35:49.629 --> 00:35:52.290
to look at gut microbiomes because, you know, I

525
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.800
mentioned that the chewing and um and so this

526
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.399
is some work that my uh sadly, recently departed

527
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:02.219
colleague, John Patton was doing and other people are

528
00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:04.699
doing it in other places as well, but he

529
00:36:04.709 --> 00:36:09.689
was looking at how the um the gut microbiomes

530
00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:13.110
uh of, of individuals in, in this case, Achuar

531
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:21.370
and uh Quechua communities, um how that was affected

532
00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:24.179
by basically chica consumption. It turns out that it's

533
00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:27.969
really good for, you know, basically sharing these gut

534
00:36:27.979 --> 00:36:32.840
microflora that are really helpful. Um So anyway, but

535
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.169
I love it. I think it's, I think it's

536
00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:38.360
really good and there's hot, there's a very wide

537
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:45.899
range of um of styles and quality. Um, A

538
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:48.699
study that I have been wanting to do for

539
00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:52.429
a long time is essentially a blind taste test.

540
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.110
Um BECAUSE everybody is very open about the fact

541
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.850
that there's different qualities of chica and everybody knows,

542
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.699
you know, this woman makes really good chica and

543
00:37:03.709 --> 00:37:06.570
this woman makes a not so great chica. Um

544
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:12.969
BUT there's not very good consensus on what qualities

545
00:37:12.979 --> 00:37:16.760
would predict which women would make good chica. And

546
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.770
from an evolutionary perspective, we have a couple of

547
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:23.169
competing hypotheses, right? It could be that men are

548
00:37:23.179 --> 00:37:27.100
picking up on um chemical cues of fecundity and

549
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.449
fertility, right? So that we would expect that the

550
00:37:30.649 --> 00:37:35.120
chica that's produced by younger women with more reproductive

551
00:37:35.129 --> 00:37:38.209
potential ahead of them would be preferred. However, there's

552
00:37:38.219 --> 00:37:45.449
also pretty good argument that practice and experience actually

553
00:37:45.459 --> 00:37:47.739
make for better chica. So there's also a prediction

554
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.129
that actually men would probably, or everybody on average

555
00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:55.310
might prefer the chica of older women. And then

556
00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.820
there's, you know, mh C predictions, maybe men prefer

557
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.179
the chica of women who are more distantly related

558
00:38:02.189 --> 00:38:05.379
to them. And women maybe prefer the chica of

559
00:38:05.389 --> 00:38:07.629
women who are more closely related to them. So,

560
00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:10.270
there's all sorts of predictions that we could test.

561
00:38:10.379 --> 00:38:13.760
Um And I'm dying to do this. Uh And

562
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.399
one of these days I'll get around to it,

563
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:15.939
by

564
00:38:15.949 --> 00:38:19.169
the way, can you find uh Chi anywhere out

565
00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:20.500
outside of Ecuador?

566
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.560
Yes. So, Chica is widely produced throughout South America,

567
00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:30.199
but it differs really dramatically in different places and

568
00:38:30.209 --> 00:38:34.199
it's, it's made both by highland uh populations and

569
00:38:34.209 --> 00:38:40.080
lowland populations. Um AND with different kinds of core

570
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.800
ingredients. So in some places, it's made with um

571
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:48.800
uh mice and other places, it's made with uh

572
00:38:49.149 --> 00:38:51.389
oh my gosh, all sorts of things. Bitter manioc

573
00:38:51.399 --> 00:38:53.800
in Brazil, I think. But that requires a whole

574
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:59.120
different process. Um CORN. Uh And then even in,

575
00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:02.399
in, in Schwar communities, they have multiple different kinds

576
00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:04.790
of chica and some of them are really special

577
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.010
for special occasions. So there's chica de Chata which

578
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.090
is made with the Chanta Palm. Um That is

579
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.580
a very special occasion chica. Um I'll make chica

580
00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:19.600
with uh uh Maduros which are uh uh basically

581
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.479
bananas, but the plantains that are have become yellow

582
00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:28.110
and sweet. Um And uh yeah, so there's all

583
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.439
sorts of different kinds of chica. Um BUT short

584
00:39:31.679 --> 00:39:36.399
chicas, primarily sweet maniac. So

585
00:39:36.409 --> 00:39:38.870
OK, so to get back on track, uh

586
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.439
I get very excited about.

587
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. And it's, it seems

588
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:49.159
interesting to me. I mean, I'm not much of

589
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.479
a, I'm not much of a person who likes

590
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.520
alcohol. But, yeah, if, if it tastes good. Yeah,

591
00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.929
I, I, I'm there, I'm there. So, uh, um,

592
00:40:00.939 --> 00:40:04.899
about parent of spring conflict because earlier when we

593
00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:07.909
were talking about partner choice. O of course, in

594
00:40:07.919 --> 00:40:11.120
the case of men, that's one of the reasons

595
00:40:11.129 --> 00:40:13.189
why I asked you if the parents of the

596
00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:15.979
men also played the role there. You said they

597
00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:20.475
don't really, so that doesn't matter really there. But

598
00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:23.185
when it comes to the women, there are, of

599
00:40:23.195 --> 00:40:27.415
course, some women as we should expect that do

600
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:31.725
not like their father's choices. And so how does

601
00:40:31.735 --> 00:40:34.415
parent offspring conflict play out there?

602
00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:39.929
Yeah. So this is my, my really big interest

603
00:40:39.939 --> 00:40:44.879
currently as I'm very interested in the, the idea

604
00:40:44.889 --> 00:40:50.389
of parent offspring conflict. Um And where the really

605
00:40:50.399 --> 00:40:56.129
interesting research questions are. So, you know, the first

606
00:40:56.139 --> 00:41:01.129
thing is that, well, the very first thing that

607
00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:06.399
I want to, to say is that parent, parental

608
00:41:06.409 --> 00:41:13.310
choice, parents being involved at all in offspring mating

609
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.020
decisions is a derived trait. It's a really human

610
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.719
trait. We don't see it basically in, in any

611
00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:21.979
other animal that I can that I know of

612
00:41:21.989 --> 00:41:27.850
where any third party has any sort of vested

613
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:34.469
interest in somebody else's mating decisions. So to that

614
00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:36.949
extent, you know, we need to think about this

615
00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:43.300
as very much related to the human mating context.

616
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.239
Um AND the, the really specific challenges of the

617
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.969
human mating context. So in in terms of the

618
00:41:51.979 --> 00:41:55.530
parent offspring conflict. Uh YOU know, the general concept,

619
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.540
this goes right back to, you know, Trevor's parental

620
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.280
parental conflict paper, which has to do with the

621
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:07.090
fact that of course, Children should want as much

622
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.939
of their parents investment in resources as they can

623
00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:12.129
possibly get because it's related to their own reproductive

624
00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:15.449
success. And parents of course, should be trying to

625
00:42:15.459 --> 00:42:18.639
distribute their investment and resources across their offspring in

626
00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:21.409
order to get the most reproductive uh benefit to

627
00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:26.649
themselves. Because of this, we also should expect that

628
00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:30.790
if we're talking about preferences for a mate, for

629
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.699
an offspring that on average parents and offspring are

630
00:42:35.709 --> 00:42:38.110
going to have a pretty large overlap in their

631
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:44.189
interests. It's not massive conflict of interest because the

632
00:42:44.199 --> 00:42:50.000
daughters maximizing her own reproductive potential. This should on

633
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:54.169
the whole benefit the parent reproductive success as well.

634
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.010
Now, of course, there's a bunch of caveats to

635
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:01.179
that um that make it not work out so

636
00:43:01.189 --> 00:43:03.760
nicely. Um So first of all, there's not complete

637
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.820
overlap. Daughters, fitness is only a small piece of

638
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.300
parents overall fitness. Um And the relative weight to

639
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:16.270
their fitness of her reproductive success is going to

640
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.500
depend on a whole bunch of factors, including things

641
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.389
like how many offspring they have. Is she the

642
00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:26.310
only one that their entire fitness is resting on

643
00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.000
or is she one of 10? Um That's gonna

644
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:36.090
make a difference, the relative impact, the relative influence

645
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.310
on the parents own fitness of their individual children's

646
00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:46.800
reproductive success compared to the direct benefits that they

647
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:50.760
could potentially get from these mating decisions is gonna

648
00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:54.679
also affect how big that that gap, that conflict

649
00:43:54.689 --> 00:43:59.159
of interest is. Um And there's a whole bunch

650
00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:03.399
of ways that parents should be interested in the

651
00:44:03.409 --> 00:44:07.439
mating choices of their offspring that aren't directly related

652
00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:11.439
to the potential reproductive success of their offspring. But

653
00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:13.000
instead are related to some of the things that

654
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:18.399
we've already talked about alliance uh opportunities. Um So

655
00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:22.010
the alliance value of a potential son-in-law is going

656
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.949
to be really, really important to um a father's

657
00:44:25.959 --> 00:44:29.889
direct fitness, whereas it might have very little impact

658
00:44:30.419 --> 00:44:36.010
on the daughter's reproductive success. Um I mentioned mating

659
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.209
opportunities. So again, there might be uh through these

660
00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.370
alliances and we see this cross culturally in all

661
00:44:43.379 --> 00:44:45.889
sorts of places, especially where we see arranged marriages,

662
00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:48.510
part of what parents are max, part of what

663
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.969
parents are maximizing is those social benefits, the network

664
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:58.540
um benefits mating opportunities for their other Children. Uh

665
00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:04.969
And um and e enhancing kinship ties. Um Other

666
00:45:04.979 --> 00:45:07.469
factors that will affect this would be things like

667
00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:10.350
the parents, particularly the dad's age. So, is he

668
00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.040
still reproductively competitive or is he now just trying

669
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.370
to get the reproductive benefits from his Children if

670
00:45:19.379 --> 00:45:22.879
he's still reproductively competitive? Which again, because men can

671
00:45:22.889 --> 00:45:28.090
reproduce throughout their lifetimes, he probably is he can

672
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:32.560
also gain direct benefits by arranging his daughter's marriage.

673
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:36.320
And and getting potentially other mates for himself or

674
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.959
his Children. And of course, the resources that um

675
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.590
mates of offspring can bring to the, the the

676
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.889
parents or the the siblings of that um that

677
00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:53.580
offspring that's going to partner up. Now, all of

678
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.570
those costs and benefits differ from one context to

679
00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.199
the other. And this is part of why we

680
00:45:59.209 --> 00:46:04.530
see such really different effects of parental influence on

681
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.139
offspring mate choice and different patterns of parental influence.

682
00:46:09.149 --> 00:46:14.830
Um So in the Schwar context, we expect in

683
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.070
the traditional context, this probably would have been, you

684
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:23.209
know, near the extreme end of conflicts of interest

685
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.959
um because there were between, particularly between fathers and

686
00:46:28.969 --> 00:46:34.080
daughters. So again, this is a really gendered argument

687
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.000
because we're not seeing the same thing at all

688
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:41.070
on the side of men's mating choices, right? So

689
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.250
this is really about the conflict of interest between

690
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:49.760
fathers and daughters. And there's several factors that make

691
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.560
it, make it make it more beneficial to fathers

692
00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.870
to prioritize their own interests over their daughters. One

693
00:46:57.879 --> 00:47:02.719
of those is that there's extreme reproductive skew. Um

694
00:47:02.729 --> 00:47:07.179
Meaning that again, because of this general polygamy, um

695
00:47:07.189 --> 00:47:10.120
if most men had two or three wives, that

696
00:47:10.129 --> 00:47:13.860
means that most men had 2 to 3 times

697
00:47:14.669 --> 00:47:20.570
the reproductive success of any individual woman. Um Now,

698
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.719
usually these things even out because again, the average

699
00:47:25.729 --> 00:47:27.719
number of offspring for men should be the same

700
00:47:27.729 --> 00:47:29.500
as the average number of offspring for women since

701
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.219
there's, each child has one off, one parent, uh

702
00:47:32.229 --> 00:47:36.929
one parent of each sex, but we're missing a

703
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:40.570
lot of men. So we have, you know, this

704
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.330
idea that you, your sons really are either going

705
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.879
to have like three times the reproductive value of

706
00:47:47.889 --> 00:47:51.870
your daughters or they're gonna be dead. Right? Is

707
00:47:51.879 --> 00:47:55.239
really from the parental perspective what you're looking at.

708
00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:59.340
Um But that means that, you know, you're not

709
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:03.070
thinking as much about the daughter's reproductive success. It's,

710
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.770
it's about, you know, how can I get the,

711
00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.929
these direct benefits to myself or my sons? Um,

712
00:48:11.129 --> 00:48:13.419
THERE'S also a, as I just mentioned that what

713
00:48:13.429 --> 00:48:16.169
led to that is there is a highly discrepant

714
00:48:16.179 --> 00:48:19.550
sex ratio. So there's far more women than there

715
00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.949
are men. So again, we should expect that dad's

716
00:48:23.959 --> 00:48:28.149
interests are going to be dramatically at odds with

717
00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:33.639
daughters. Um, IN terms of what they're going to

718
00:48:33.649 --> 00:48:41.689
be prioritizing. Um If uh if fathers could gain

719
00:48:41.699 --> 00:48:45.610
allies or mates for themselves or their sons, those

720
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.939
bene benefits likely would have outweighed what really would

721
00:48:49.949 --> 00:48:54.139
have been sort of marginal cost, possibly, possibly dramatic

722
00:48:54.149 --> 00:48:59.030
cost, but probably more marginal costs, uh, or detriments

723
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.459
to daughters, fitness, certainly to her happiness, right. If

724
00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:05.929
she's being married off to somebody that she doesn't

725
00:49:05.939 --> 00:49:08.719
care about, she doesn't have a connection with, she's

726
00:49:08.729 --> 00:49:12.120
not gonna be terribly happy. And here I have

727
00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:15.260
to take another side note to talk about the

728
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:21.179
relationship between happiness and fitness. Um, BECAUSE of course,

729
00:49:21.189 --> 00:49:25.739
we know that natural selection, it's not necessarily maximizing

730
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:32.649
happiness, it's maximizing reproductive fitness. But those things aren't

731
00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:38.979
totally orthogonal, right? Happiness. What, what is happiness? Happiness

732
00:49:38.989 --> 00:49:43.929
is often influenced by the presence of a cooper

733
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:48.530
cooper or supportive others feeling safe, secure, freedom from

734
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:52.110
fear or hardship. Right? So all of those things

735
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.870
are likely to actually have very measurable real benefits

736
00:49:55.879 --> 00:50:00.110
to reproductive success too. So, well, it's true that

737
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.159
happiness isn't what you know, leads to fitness. It

738
00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:07.239
does, you know, it, it's important and if we

739
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.550
have, you know, daughters or women in general, who

740
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.550
are just, you know, miserable and, and being treated

741
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.139
as travel, um that does have an impact on

742
00:50:18.149 --> 00:50:23.139
their own reproductive success. But in this context, the

743
00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:26.550
impact on their reproductive success of that is likely

744
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.409
to be much smaller than the impact on their

745
00:50:29.419 --> 00:50:33.629
dad's fitness of being able to get these alliances

746
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:38.659
and these um network ties. In addition, as I

747
00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:44.590
said, this was traditionally an extremely patriarchal society. Um

748
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.979
So there's a, a again, strong conflict of interest

749
00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:57.580
between um the fathers and daughters in that the

750
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.290
daughters weren't really expected to have any autonomy, any

751
00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:06.840
say. Um AGAIN, as I said before, as in

752
00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:10.989
all societies, women, e even though women were, were

753
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.739
definitely subordinated, right? They were, they were regularly beaten,

754
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.679
they were treated as property and they were basically

755
00:51:17.689 --> 00:51:21.219
wholly at the command of their husband. But as

756
00:51:21.229 --> 00:51:25.199
in all societies, shore women also also both had

757
00:51:25.209 --> 00:51:29.000
both the means of resistance and also ways of

758
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.489
influencing their society. And some of the things that

759
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:38.060
really affected that their ability to resist um are,

760
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.850
are things like, for example, in Amazonian horticultural societies,

761
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.889
women have a really a great deal of physical

762
00:51:44.899 --> 00:51:48.179
autonomy. They're spending their days in the gardens which

763
00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:50.489
the garden is not, you know, like a little

764
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:56.239
plot right outside your house. It's usually uh 5

765
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.110
to 5 minutes to an hour long walk through

766
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.189
the rainforest to a place that's, you know, again,

767
00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.110
just cleared out of the rain forest. So they're

768
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.629
pretty much on their own um out and about

769
00:52:10.159 --> 00:52:16.169
um women have vast ecological knowledge and skills. They

770
00:52:16.179 --> 00:52:19.739
have strength and endurance, they have large kin and

771
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:23.659
social networks. So, one of their strategies of resistance

772
00:52:23.669 --> 00:52:27.129
is their ability to run their ability to leave

773
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.820
bad partners, bad parents even now, that's limited because

774
00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:35.199
they can't live indefinitely on their own. As you

775
00:52:35.209 --> 00:52:39.560
said, there's really, you know, is all subsistence. Uh

776
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.530
IT peoples are there, there's a high rate of

777
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:48.040
interdependence. Um So they can't do that indefinitely but

778
00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:53.080
women, they certainly are able to leave. Um EVEN

779
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.939
if very often they're brought back, um They also

780
00:52:55.949 --> 00:52:59.310
have more subtle strategies of their ability to withhold

781
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.169
food or cheetah. Again, as I said before, that,

782
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.850
that can really actually have significant impacts on their

783
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.560
husband's social standing. Um They could conceivably also withhold

784
00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.379
sex though I have to say, I haven't ever

785
00:53:14.389 --> 00:53:17.429
heard anybody cite that as a strategy that women

786
00:53:17.439 --> 00:53:21.840
used. Um And in part that maybe because there's

787
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:27.179
definitely a general uh understanding uh among at least

788
00:53:27.189 --> 00:53:30.290
the shore that I've spoken to that, um, sex

789
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.040
is a re record. Women need sex as much

790
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.850
as men do. Um So I've never heard of

791
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.729
women withholding sex, although I'm sure it must happen.

792
00:53:40.239 --> 00:53:45.149
Um AND they can impose costs on their partner.

793
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:48.429
Uh One strategy that women have available to them.

794
00:53:48.439 --> 00:53:52.770
And I am, unfortunately, I actually know personally one

795
00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.090
woman who attempted the strategy is to attempt to

796
00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:01.469
commit suicide. Um This is so the uh um

797
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:06.909
it's, it's done by consuming Barbas is a AAA

798
00:54:06.929 --> 00:54:10.110
poison that they use for fishing and women will

799
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.199
consume that um, very often when they're out in

800
00:54:13.209 --> 00:54:16.290
their gardens. Uh I mean, I, I don't mean

801
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.469
to make this sound like it happens all the

802
00:54:17.479 --> 00:54:19.530
time. Uh It does not happen all the time,

803
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.070
as I said, um I've, I've known one woman

804
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.510
um very sadly who tried this and she survived

805
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.310
and, and actually their marriage is much improved, which

806
00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:33.389
is kind of a point towards what I'm talking

807
00:54:33.399 --> 00:54:37.320
about. This being a strategy that um usually women

808
00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:41.020
don't actually die from taking this, this drug instead.

809
00:54:41.239 --> 00:54:45.100
Usually somebody finds them uh and forces them to

810
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.340
vomit. Um But what it does is it calls

811
00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:52.820
public attention to the way that their partner is

812
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:56.699
treating them. Um And this can actually end up

813
00:54:56.709 --> 00:55:00.399
exerting some uh social pressure on the husband, especially

814
00:55:00.409 --> 00:55:05.169
if it gets her family involved. Um And uh

815
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.879
uh that can is another strategy that women have

816
00:55:08.889 --> 00:55:12.510
to subvert some of these things. So especially again,

817
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.610
if a woman has been married against her will

818
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.290
to a man who she does not want to

819
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.729
be with, who is abusive or harmful. This is

820
00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:23.909
the strategies that she has. Um And of course,

821
00:55:23.919 --> 00:55:28.429
also, uh women have recourse to traditional medicines and

822
00:55:28.439 --> 00:55:32.590
witchcraft is practiced amongst the shoar. Um They can

823
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.219
go to shamans um And uh have a variety

824
00:55:37.229 --> 00:55:41.030
of, of um strategies through by which they can

825
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.820
basically exert their own preferences.

826
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.840
So, uh I, I mean, a lot we could

827
00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:51.209
talk about there. But uh let me ask you

828
00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:54.479
this. So uh of course, we're talking about the

829
00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.209
Schwar and I would imagine that across many other

830
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:02.840
human societies, we would see also this interplay between

831
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:07.360
female choice and parental choice playing out. Uh So,

832
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.479
in terms of, uh and now I'm talking more

833
00:56:10.489 --> 00:56:14.179
generally in terms of evolutionary theory and all of

834
00:56:14.189 --> 00:56:17.729
that. So uh do we know what are the

835
00:56:17.739 --> 00:56:22.399
relative influences of female choice and parental choice on

836
00:56:22.409 --> 00:56:25.570
the evolution of human made references?

837
00:56:26.979 --> 00:56:29.800
Well, so this is where, first of all, I

838
00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:32.540
would say again, we really need to put parental

839
00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.860
choice in context of it being very much a

840
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:39.409
derived trait and it's really we're talking about two

841
00:56:39.419 --> 00:56:42.469
derived traits and by derived, I mean, this is

842
00:56:42.479 --> 00:56:45.919
something new in our lineage. Um And the two

843
00:56:45.929 --> 00:56:49.840
traits that are derived is both parental interest, their

844
00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:54.300
parental preferences for the mating partners of their offspring.

845
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:58.770
So that's something that presumably arose in the human

846
00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:02.969
evolutionary history after we split from uh our last

847
00:57:02.979 --> 00:57:07.189
common ancestor with the great apes um and parental

848
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.540
influence. And we have to think of that again

849
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:14.739
as a an adaptive strategy because it costs something

850
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:18.379
to exert influence, right? So if parents are doing

851
00:57:18.389 --> 00:57:22.620
that, they're incurring some costs in doing that. So

852
00:57:22.629 --> 00:57:26.520
those are the two derived traits. But as I

853
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.610
said, you know, we need to put that in

854
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:37.060
the larger evolutionary context and ancestral prehuman populations or

855
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:42.219
early human populations probably actually underwent similar selection pressures

856
00:57:42.229 --> 00:57:46.219
as is typical of most extant primate species, which

857
00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:49.100
is characterized more by, first of all, substantially higher

858
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:54.030
obligate investment, parental investment by females than males. Um

859
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.260
AND therefore probably across most of human e or

860
00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:02.580
prehuman evolutionary history. We would have seen stronger selection

861
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:08.340
by and for female preferences for mates and compared

862
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:10.379
to male preferences, and there would have been no

863
00:58:10.389 --> 00:58:12.810
parental preferences, right? That wouldn't have even been a

864
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:17.939
force um and stronger selection by and for male

865
00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:23.310
intersexual competition, direct competition, especially physical competition um over

866
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:29.169
mating opportunities compared to female intersexual competition. So up

867
00:58:29.179 --> 00:58:32.820
until we get to, you know, pretty recent evolutionary

868
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:37.760
history, we're looking at probably a very, very strong

869
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:42.500
effect of female choice on it in terms of

870
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:47.560
a selective pressure um on the species. Now, then

871
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:51.399
we think about how the mating context of humans

872
00:58:51.409 --> 00:58:55.510
changed and there's a lot of unknowns, right? We

873
00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:04.070
don't know exactly what the typical reproductive context was,

874
00:59:04.209 --> 00:59:08.729
but we're pretty sure that it relied on co-operative

875
00:59:08.739 --> 00:59:13.550
breeding to some extent. Right now, co-operative breeding doesn't

876
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.709
necessarily mean that it has to be the two

877
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:21.110
biological parents that are investing. But it does mean

878
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.919
that we require as a species, we require some

879
00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:32.860
degree of co-operative investment in offspring. So within that

880
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.419
context, we actually are gonna start to see two

881
00:59:36.429 --> 00:59:38.790
different things. We're gonna start to see both an

882
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.320
increase for selection for male preferences for mates, right?

883
00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:47.820
So males are gonna start to become more and

884
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:52.429
more selective about their partners as they're investing more

885
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:57.500
in their partners and offspring. Um AND parental preferences.

886
00:59:57.979 --> 01:00:03.489
Um SH should start to be favored by natural

887
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.560
selection, the expression of having preferences and be will

888
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:11.000
being willing to incur costs to try to achieve

889
01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:14.169
those preferences. So, you know, so this idea of

890
01:00:14.179 --> 01:00:18.320
which one's more influential. I, yeah, I don't know,

891
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.929
it depends on what time scale we're looking at

892
01:00:19.939 --> 01:00:24.129
and which adaptations we're looking at. What I think

893
01:00:24.139 --> 01:00:28.229
is more interesting and more relevant than, than sort

894
01:00:28.239 --> 01:00:31.149
of this question of, you know, what's the balance

895
01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:35.350
of female choice to parental choice in terms of

896
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.120
what we see is to really what we need

897
01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:39.790
to do is we need to identify the specific

898
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.739
traits that are under selection, the, whether those are

899
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.439
preferences or phenotypic features or behavioral features. Um And

900
01:00:48.449 --> 01:00:53.530
what would have been the influence on those of

901
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:59.840
individual mate preferences versus third party made preferences is

902
01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:01.510
really the way to think about it, right? Is

903
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.229
even, you know, because, because we know that too,

904
01:01:04.239 --> 01:01:09.629
it's, it's not just parents right, extended can, can,

905
01:01:09.639 --> 01:01:14.429
can have uh an interest in some populations, the

906
01:01:14.439 --> 01:01:17.629
community as a whole has an interest. So, I

907
01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:20.350
mean, it's really this idea of third party mate

908
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.709
preferences and then we can start to think about

909
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.030
what I think is the really interesting part is

910
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.989
to think about what are the contexts in which

911
01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:38.510
we should expect to see more overlap, more, it,

912
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.790
it it um concordance of interests, right? Versus where

913
01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.889
we more likely to see more conflict of interest.

914
01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:49.709
And then we can start to make predictions about

915
01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:52.840
in what context, if there's conflict of interest in

916
01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:57.580
what contexts might we expect parental preferences to win

917
01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.830
out? And in what context might we expect offspring

918
01:02:00.919 --> 01:02:04.310
preferences to win out? And I, I think the

919
01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.120
way that we need to do that is we

920
01:02:08.129 --> 01:02:14.709
need to really think about um excuse me, the

921
01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:20.520
uh the relative costs and benefits to the different

922
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:25.629
actors in these situations. So in general, I tend

923
01:02:25.639 --> 01:02:27.770
to think of it as fathers and daughters though,

924
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.570
again, it can be mothers and sons as well.

925
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:36.949
Um But uh I I if we think about

926
01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:42.310
um what are the the factors that are going

927
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.360
to influence the cost benefit ratio to fathers? It's

928
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:49.260
things like, what is the value of acquiring their

929
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.919
own social connections or mating opportunities? What is the

930
01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:56.080
value of acquiring social connections or mating opportunities for

931
01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:00.399
others including maybe there's their other offspring or siblings?

932
01:03:00.879 --> 01:03:04.379
Um What is the value or the cost of

933
01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:07.500
exerting effort to impose their will over others? So

934
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.770
how easy is it, how hard is it, what

935
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.060
are the features that make it easy or hard

936
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.080
that cost is gonna be a deciding factor? Um

937
01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:21.939
What is the costs that they're likely to incur

938
01:03:21.949 --> 01:03:27.629
from overriding their daughters preferences? Right. So again, in

939
01:03:27.639 --> 01:03:32.669
terms of if daughters in a bad mateship that's

940
01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:36.070
gonna have some effect on, on dad's reproductive, dad's

941
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.260
fitness as well. So, what's that cost? Um And

942
01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:43.159
then here's the thing that I think is one

943
01:03:43.169 --> 01:03:45.189
of the thing that has me most excited. What

944
01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:50.709
I'm really interested in is looking at the gap

945
01:03:51.189 --> 01:03:55.659
in social competence or social knowledge between parents and

946
01:03:55.669 --> 01:04:00.800
offspring. So that also is going to impact if

947
01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.350
parents and offspring have pretty much the same information,

948
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.540
they can come to the same conclusion about mates

949
01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:10.479
for their offspring, then that's going to sort of

950
01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:14.469
increase the potential benefits. Uh uh OR, or I'm

951
01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.959
sorry, decrease the potential benefits of dad making the

952
01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:22.199
decision and increase the potential costs. Um Whereas if

953
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:26.479
there's a big gap in this, so parents have

954
01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:33.540
better information or are more uh able to evaluate

955
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:36.590
potential mates on a variety of factors in terms

956
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.969
of long term reliability or investment prospects or whatever.

957
01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:46.010
Um, THEN it might be a lot more costly

958
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.840
to let daughters have their own preferences. Um And

959
01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:53.979
then the same thing, you know, and thinking about

960
01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:56.760
the payoffs to, to daughters, right, we need to

961
01:04:56.770 --> 01:05:01.560
think about what are the potential benefits to her

962
01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:05.469
being able to fulfill her own mate preferences. And

963
01:05:05.909 --> 01:05:09.830
I think in some environments and in some contexts

964
01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:12.750
that benefit might not be that huge, especially again

965
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.699
if her parents and her interests are aligned, why

966
01:05:16.709 --> 01:05:20.290
fight about it. Um But I think the big

967
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:26.629
place where that makes a difference is in predictions

968
01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:30.280
of compatibility, right? Because this is the stuff. So

969
01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:32.800
people have been focusing all the people, most of

970
01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:35.290
the people who are writing that parent offspring conflict

971
01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:39.719
inmate choice have been focusing a lot on things

972
01:05:39.729 --> 01:05:45.719
like daughters, daughters should prefer cues to genetic quality

973
01:05:45.729 --> 01:05:49.870
or sexual attractiveness and parents should prefer cues to

974
01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:54.360
resources or net social networks. I think the big

975
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:59.120
difference between parents and, and daughters is in their

976
01:05:59.129 --> 01:06:04.620
ability to assess compatibility. Um We just don't have

977
01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:08.699
access to the same cues for other people, including

978
01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:12.179
things like scent cues, scent preferences that are we,

979
01:06:12.189 --> 01:06:15.780
we have lots of evidence that both men and

980
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.510
women prefer the scent of people who are, they

981
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.989
are more genetically compatible with. Um We don't have

982
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.800
access to the sent preferences of somebody else, but

983
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:32.719
also that sort of indefinable thing that we talk

984
01:06:32.729 --> 01:06:36.209
about when we talk about human mating. That click,

985
01:06:36.219 --> 01:06:40.500
right. That chemistry, we still haven't totally figured out

986
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:44.870
what exactly that is. Probably because it's an incredibly

987
01:06:44.879 --> 01:06:49.659
complicated algorithm taking into account all sorts of information

988
01:06:49.669 --> 01:06:55.729
about shared worldviews, shared values, shared psychology, shared personality,

989
01:06:55.739 --> 01:06:58.689
you know, whatever it is, all of these things

990
01:06:58.699 --> 01:07:02.750
that are weighted in different ways that help us

991
01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.689
predict who's somebody I can just be with, I

992
01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:08.620
can get along with that I can work effectively

993
01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.320
with. Right. And there, I think it's a really

994
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:18.800
open question who's better at, at sort of making

995
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:23.000
those decisions. And I strongly suspect that that's gonna

996
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:28.399
change dramatically over the lifespan of daughters as they

997
01:07:28.409 --> 01:07:33.350
go from Children to adolescence to young adults, to

998
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.030
adults. Um So that's some of the stuff that

999
01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.330
I really want to look at in the future

1000
01:07:39.449 --> 01:07:45.580
is looking at this developmental trajectory and where daughters

1001
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:52.459
assessments of potential mates, um when they gain sort

1002
01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:57.770
of the the equal uh reliability as their assessments

1003
01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.929
of their parents. And

1004
01:07:58.939 --> 01:08:02.479
and I would imagine that the developmental trajectory would

1005
01:08:02.489 --> 01:08:07.409
also include, I mean, unique life experiences, right? Because

1006
01:08:07.419 --> 01:08:11.330
I mean, as people try things out with different

1007
01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.040
mates, they also change their mate preferences I mean,

1008
01:08:16.049 --> 01:08:20.169
if women have had bad experiences with these type

1009
01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.810
of men, then probably as they grow older, they

1010
01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:27.149
prefer that type of men. Right.

1011
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.430
Right. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1012
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:33.450
Uh, SO, I, I mean, just generally speaking, when

1013
01:08:33.459 --> 01:08:37.299
it comes to studying human mate preferences, we've been

1014
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.799
focusing here a lot on female mate preferences, but

1015
01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:43.160
I would imagine it would be the same for

1016
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:47.939
a male mate preferences. I mean, uh, even if

1017
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:51.850
we come at it, from an evolutionary perspective, we

1018
01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:55.049
have to take into account that uh lots of

1019
01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.479
it as is context dependent, right? I mean, not

1020
01:08:59.488 --> 01:09:04.738
only those particular individual life experiences, for example, but

1021
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:09.438
even more generally, it would be influenced by probably

1022
01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:16.578
the ecology, the economic circumstances, social influences, peer evaluations,

1023
01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:20.108
influences from the family and so on and so

1024
01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:24.818
forth. So there is, there's lots of environmental inputs

1025
01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.038
that go into them.

1026
01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:29.000
Right. Right. And that's where I would say that's

1027
01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:31.839
actually what the adaptation is. So when we think

1028
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:37.318
about mating adaptations, II, I think it's, you know,

1029
01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:40.167
there are a few things that seem to be

1030
01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:45.258
fairly catalyzed in humans. So things like preferring sort

1031
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:50.698
of sex, typical body shapes um is, you know,

1032
01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:57.619
pretty consistent, but the real adaptation is the the

1033
01:09:57.628 --> 01:10:02.129
cognitive work that's being done in terms of taking

1034
01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.859
in information about the environment. And that's the, as

1035
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.890
you said, the ecology, but also the social environment,

1036
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:14.580
it is all of that stuff, right? And this

1037
01:10:14.589 --> 01:10:16.129
is where I said, I think, you know, we

1038
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:23.819
are barely barely scratching the surface in understanding all

1039
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:29.350
the the the the crunching of data that our

1040
01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:34.000
brains are doing and we experience it as emotion,

1041
01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:36.479
right? I like this person. That person makes me

1042
01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:39.580
ick. Yeah. You know, that's how we experience it,

1043
01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.759
but that's like the output of vast amounts of

1044
01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.040
information, a lot of which we don't even have

1045
01:10:47.049 --> 01:10:50.609
conscious access to, right? Like these scent preferences, we're

1046
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.640
not even aware of those, but they're strongly influencing

1047
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:57.750
our preferences. And I think this is the thing

1048
01:10:57.759 --> 01:11:03.759
that when we talk about human adaptations, almost all

1049
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.740
of them, this is what makes humans so unique,

1050
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:09.580
right? We evolved to be able to live in

1051
01:11:09.589 --> 01:11:16.250
the most diverse ecologies imaginable. We live in every

1052
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:20.080
natural ecology on the planet except for like one,

1053
01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:25.620
right? We live in incredibly diverse social environments that

1054
01:11:25.629 --> 01:11:28.370
are shaped in part by the ecological needs of

1055
01:11:28.379 --> 01:11:33.200
various places, but also shaped by tradition and cultural

1056
01:11:33.209 --> 01:11:38.509
transmission and cultural evolution. And so our greatest adaptation

1057
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.339
is in the behavioral flexibility of being able to

1058
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.470
pay attention to the relevant cues across these different

1059
01:11:46.479 --> 01:11:49.750
domains. So I study mate preferences, right? But other

1060
01:11:49.759 --> 01:11:53.560
people study other kinds of partner choice, co-operative partner,

1061
01:11:53.569 --> 01:11:58.950
choice, uh alliances or all sorts of things when

1062
01:11:58.959 --> 01:12:02.354
you know, when to be prosocial or antisocial. And

1063
01:12:02.365 --> 01:12:05.924
all of those, the the adaptation is not that

1064
01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:08.154
in humans that we have some sort of rote

1065
01:12:08.165 --> 01:12:14.634
response. It's that we are doing massive calculations of

1066
01:12:14.645 --> 01:12:22.520
information and then producing on average pretty good responses.

1067
01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:26.330
Yeah. Yeah. No, ju just before we move on

1068
01:12:26.339 --> 01:12:29.020
to another topic, let me just say that that's

1069
01:12:29.029 --> 01:12:31.850
one of the reasons why sometimes II, I mean,

1070
01:12:31.859 --> 01:12:35.899
I'm getting increasingly frustrated by people who talk about

1071
01:12:36.589 --> 01:12:41.729
innate mate preferences because, I mean, it's like all,

1072
01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:46.830
all men and all women everywhere every time pre

1073
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:50.649
tend to prefer this kind of partner. I mean,

1074
01:12:50.819 --> 01:12:51.649
really,

1075
01:12:53.459 --> 01:12:58.040
really that it's all about the level of abstraction,

1076
01:12:58.049 --> 01:13:00.660
the level of generalization, right? So some things like

1077
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:04.259
we can say, for example, we should expect that

1078
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:07.839
women should place a lot of emphasis on cues

1079
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.939
to, are they going to have enough resources to

1080
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:16.209
raise offspring? That's a pretty general level of, of,

1081
01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.140
you know, talking about a specific adaptation because what

1082
01:13:19.149 --> 01:13:23.259
those resources are can vary enormously, they might be

1083
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:25.970
physical resources, they might be nutritional resources, they might

1084
01:13:25.979 --> 01:13:28.200
be social resources, you know, there's all sorts of

1085
01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:29.950
things, it doesn't necessarily need to be from the

1086
01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:33.689
dead, you know, anyway. Yeah, it's um there's very

1087
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.330
little that I would say is, is, you know,

1088
01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:37.410
innate,

1089
01:13:38.089 --> 01:13:41.569
right? So let's talk a little bit about paternal

1090
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.370
investment then. So what do we know about paternal

1091
01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:50.330
investment in humans? How has it evolved and what

1092
01:13:50.339 --> 01:13:53.549
are basically the roles that fathers play?

1093
01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:57.459
Well, it depends on who you ask, but in

1094
01:13:57.470 --> 01:14:01.339
general, um as I've said, several times, I think,

1095
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.850
you know, the thing that we can, most of

1096
01:14:03.859 --> 01:14:08.810
us probably agree on is that humans require human

1097
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:14.149
offspring, human infants and Children require enormous amounts of

1098
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.470
investment. Um, THEY are not able to nutritionally sustain

1099
01:14:19.479 --> 01:14:22.140
themselves. Although we're learning more and more about how

1100
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:25.580
much Children are doing with foraging and how much

1101
01:14:25.589 --> 01:14:29.430
they're contributing. They're still, they're not able to sustain

1102
01:14:29.439 --> 01:14:34.310
themselves as a general rule until mid to late

1103
01:14:34.319 --> 01:14:40.580
teens. Um So they're dependent on somebody else provisioning

1104
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.919
to some extent, we have general because we have

1105
01:14:46.109 --> 01:14:49.479
a really shortened inter birth interval, right? We have

1106
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:53.899
multiple dependent offspring at different developmental stages at once

1107
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:58.810
that we have to invest in. So cooper breeding

1108
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.549
in, in that true sense of cooper investment in

1109
01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.290
offspring has to be part of human mating strategies.

1110
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:13.790
Now, in terms of paternal investment again, as we

1111
01:15:13.799 --> 01:15:16.040
just talked about, right. There's a lot of factors

1112
01:15:16.049 --> 01:15:19.529
that go into it and it can vary enormously

1113
01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.020
based on the context if we wanna sort of

1114
01:15:23.029 --> 01:15:27.509
make a broad argument about what has been favored

1115
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.689
by natural selection in terms of men's attitudes or

1116
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:38.069
interests. Clearly, there has been selection on human males

1117
01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.250
to like kids more than, you know, males of

1118
01:15:43.259 --> 01:15:46.970
most other species, maybe not as much as females,

1119
01:15:46.979 --> 01:15:50.370
but more than most other males um to tolerate

1120
01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.970
kids, to be particularly sensitive to cues of paternity.

1121
01:15:54.109 --> 01:15:57.689
Right? So we we there's some evidence that suggests

1122
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.990
that men are much more their, their affection for

1123
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.049
Children is more contingent on cues to similarity to

1124
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.200
themselves, cues to potential paternity. Whereas women's is not.

1125
01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:15.140
Um So there's lots of evidence that there has

1126
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:19.899
been selection for paternal investment and this evidence can

1127
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:22.910
runs the gamut from hormonal studies that show for

1128
01:16:22.919 --> 01:16:26.040
example, that men's levels of testosterone drop after they

1129
01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:30.029
have Children, all sorts of uh different kinds of

1130
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.509
evidence suggesting that there's definitely been selection on men

1131
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:38.439
to care about kids to be involved with kids.

1132
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:44.529
Um But as you said, there's not, there's not

1133
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:50.299
one solution. So one of my favorite examples, cultural

1134
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:53.890
examples, ethnographic examples to talk about is uh the

1135
01:16:53.899 --> 01:16:57.100
moo uh in China. Uh AND these are in

1136
01:16:57.109 --> 01:17:00.959
the highlands near Tibet. Um This population is, has

1137
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:03.899
been there for thousands of years. Um AND they

1138
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:07.950
practice what is referred to as walking marriage. So

1139
01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:13.790
it is a socio-economic household reproductive system that is

1140
01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.589
really different from what we see in most human

1141
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.069
populations in particular because Children are raised by their

1142
01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:28.000
mothers and their uncles. So the brothers and sisters

1143
01:17:28.009 --> 01:17:32.770
are cooperating to raise their offspring, the sisters, offspring

1144
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.229
and the fathers of those offspring are cooperating with

1145
01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.290
their sisters to raise their offspring. Um But there's

1146
01:17:42.299 --> 01:17:44.569
a few things that I think are really, really

1147
01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:52.220
important to know about relationships and paternal investment in

1148
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:57.490
among the most. So so early ethnographic descriptions suggested

1149
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.720
that this was in fact the title of, of

1150
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:05.520
one of the ethnographic books was the, uh, what

1151
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:10.029
was it? Culture without fathers, um, or hus culture

1152
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.000
without fathers or husbands, I think is the title.

1153
01:18:12.379 --> 01:18:17.569
Um, AND the implication was that people didn't even

1154
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.720
know who their biological fathers were, that this relationship

1155
01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:25.879
was completely devoid of any importance. But even in

1156
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:30.270
that ethnography and certainly in other accounts, it's clear

1157
01:18:30.279 --> 01:18:33.379
that there's a lot of variation. It, some people

1158
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:36.189
absolutely know who their fathers are. Some fathers are

1159
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:38.589
sort of involved in their kids' lives, but their

1160
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.810
primary responsibility is still to helping their sisters raise

1161
01:18:41.819 --> 01:18:47.600
their Children. Um, THERE'S very strong cultural norms among

1162
01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:52.200
the most so to not feel jealousy, to not

1163
01:18:52.209 --> 01:18:59.279
form, be proprietary over your partner. Right. Um, AND

1164
01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:08.080
yet we, most people form relatively exclusive, relatively long

1165
01:19:08.089 --> 01:19:11.830
lasting relationships now, relatively is doing a lot of

1166
01:19:11.839 --> 01:19:16.470
work there. Um But what I mean by that

1167
01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:21.379
is that we're not really seeing that everybody is

1168
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.450
just having sex with different people every night. Right.

1169
01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:29.240
And never having relationships. It rather men will say

1170
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:33.000
that they've had four or five walking marriages in

1171
01:19:33.009 --> 01:19:35.770
their lives. Right. I mean, that sounds pretty much

1172
01:19:35.779 --> 01:19:43.500
like dating and relationships in the US too. Um,

1173
01:19:44.399 --> 01:19:48.080
SO, so there's a lot of evidence both in

1174
01:19:48.089 --> 01:19:53.669
terms of men's psychology, um, and behaviors, their physiology,

1175
01:19:53.870 --> 01:20:02.470
um, and the uh the outcomes of offspring in

1176
01:20:02.479 --> 01:20:08.529
various different, um ethnographic contexts when they don't have

1177
01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.870
fathers around, that leads us to believe that paternal

1178
01:20:12.879 --> 01:20:19.879
investment has definitely been a large part of human

1179
01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:22.700
evolutionary history. But again, the thing to keep in

1180
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:28.100
mind is that it doesn't have to be just

1181
01:20:28.109 --> 01:20:33.720
in this sort of European traditional conjugal pair format.

1182
01:20:33.839 --> 01:20:36.379
Right? When we talk about paternal investment, there's all

1183
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:39.759
sorts of ways that men are investing in offspring.

1184
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.129
Um Yeah.

1185
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:45.979
Yeah. And I guess we also have to keep

1186
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:49.819
in mind that what we mean by father. Uh

1187
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:53.569
I mean, it's a little bit different across different

1188
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:58.439
societies because for example, I remember reading ethnography on,

1189
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:03.060
I think it was probably some people in, in

1190
01:21:03.069 --> 01:21:08.009
the Pacific Island where uh they were mostly a

1191
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.009
fishing society. And so the men would go out

1192
01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:16.830
for months uh for fishing. And so the kind

1193
01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:19.970
of arrangement they had there was that some of

1194
01:21:19.979 --> 01:21:23.649
the men did that and others stayed home. And

1195
01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:27.899
so for example, if the biological father was away,

1196
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:32.069
it was the responsibility of his brother to take

1197
01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.029
care of his, of his brother's Children. So, and

1198
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.779
that, and so the uncle would be considered the

1199
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:42.240
father as well.

1200
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:44.919
Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and going back to them

1201
01:21:44.939 --> 01:21:48.140
so that I was just talking about their um

1202
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:51.819
traditionally and of course, the world is always changing.

1203
01:21:51.839 --> 01:21:56.060
But traditionally, the main subsistence activities that men engaged

1204
01:21:56.069 --> 01:22:00.939
in were fishing, which often was overnight or multiple

1205
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:05.419
nights on the lake. Um LONG distance yak herding

1206
01:22:05.729 --> 01:22:08.770
um which could take men away for a week

1207
01:22:08.779 --> 01:22:15.629
to several weeks or um uh uh caravans of

1208
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.620
trade, trade goods on this trade caravan that would

1209
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:21.790
take men away for up to a year. And

1210
01:22:21.799 --> 01:22:24.299
so, you know, one of the things that to

1211
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:27.229
me is really interesting is that we see here's

1212
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.879
a, a scenario, here's a context in which it

1213
01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:36.569
would be really difficult to ensure paternity. Right. And

1214
01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:42.759
so what has developed over thousands of years, get

1215
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:45.580
rid of how important paternity is, right? So it

1216
01:22:45.589 --> 01:22:48.859
doesn't matter if those kids are actually your kids

1217
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.109
or not because you're taking care of your sister's

1218
01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.770
kids. Um And we're pretty sure that they're related

1219
01:22:54.779 --> 01:22:59.299
to you because if we calculate, you know, relatedness

1220
01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:01.890
to the female line, it's usually pretty, pretty obvious

1221
01:23:01.899 --> 01:23:04.370
it came out of her body, it's her kid.

1222
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:10.359
Yeah. So I, I mean, of course, this view

1223
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:13.839
that we have in the west of the nuclear

1224
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.990
family. Uh I mean, I've already talked with many

1225
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.500
other anthropologists on the show about that and it's

1226
01:23:19.509 --> 01:23:24.870
not universal at all but is uh no, not

1227
01:23:24.879 --> 01:23:29.339
at all, but is coupling important in human societies.

1228
01:23:30.049 --> 01:23:32.500
Yeah. So coupling. And so this is, it was

1229
01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:34.609
I was so when you had those questions on

1230
01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.620
there because I'm like, oh wow, the coupling paper

1231
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:42.259
that's going back to like 2005. Um And, and

1232
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:44.229
although I totally stand by, but here's, here's the

1233
01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.379
main thing is I probably wouldn't use the term

1234
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:49.560
coupling anymore. Um That was uh it was, it

1235
01:23:49.569 --> 01:23:50.950
was just a weird term. I don't even know

1236
01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.609
why we use that term. Um

1237
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:57.500
Actually I kind of like it. I don't know

1238
01:23:57.509 --> 01:23:58.270
why. But

1239
01:23:58.279 --> 01:24:02.029
anyway, well, the reason I don't like it is

1240
01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.549
because everybody thinks we're talking about like cop population,

1241
01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:11.189
right? Which is not what we mean. Um So,

1242
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.109
but also that, that paper was a commentary on

1243
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:22.040
a target article that was about the cult of

1244
01:24:22.049 --> 01:24:26.370
single or cult of no cult of couple in,

1245
01:24:26.439 --> 01:24:28.834
especially in the U I US and Canada. Oh

1246
01:24:28.854 --> 01:24:31.584
my gosh, this is so long ago. Um And

1247
01:24:31.595 --> 01:24:35.084
so the, the target article was pointing out really

1248
01:24:35.095 --> 01:24:37.895
all the injustices and inequities in the way societies

1249
01:24:37.984 --> 01:24:42.365
very much aimed it. And again, society being American

1250
01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:46.245
and Canadian, I think was their their target. Um

1251
01:24:46.584 --> 01:24:52.044
BUT very much about that family unit, right? And

1252
01:24:52.055 --> 01:24:55.654
so we wrote this paper, the evolution of coupling

1253
01:24:55.665 --> 01:24:59.149
in response to that. And one of the things

1254
01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.029
that we were arguing is that we should expect

1255
01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:11.279
that forming emotional bonds is that should be a

1256
01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:20.060
human universal that we, that we have the capacity

1257
01:25:20.069 --> 01:25:21.919
to do this. So when I say human universal

1258
01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:24.149
also, I don't mean everybody does it to the

1259
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.680
same extent or it's, you know, like this innate

1260
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.700
sort of, you know, now I own to you,

1261
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:34.240
right? It's there's still massive amounts of individual variation.

1262
01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.370
But definitely if we compare humans to our closest

1263
01:25:40.379 --> 01:25:45.160
primate relatives, right? We are more likely we tend

1264
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:49.720
to form these emotional attachments. And one of the,

1265
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:52.569
you know, I, so my background was very much

1266
01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.450
in the humanities. Um BEFORE I got into evolutionary

1267
01:25:56.459 --> 01:26:01.040
anthropology and I was taught like many other people

1268
01:26:01.049 --> 01:26:06.129
in my liberal arts education that romantic love was

1269
01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:11.020
something that was basically invented uh in western courts

1270
01:26:11.029 --> 01:26:14.500
in the middle ages. Um And that it wasn't,

1271
01:26:14.509 --> 01:26:21.100
you know, like a, a true human emotion. And

1272
01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.919
I kind of bought that when I was an

1273
01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:26.120
undergraduate. Many, many, many, many, many, many moons ago.

1274
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.040
Um um BECAUSE we, if we look at cultural

1275
01:26:32.049 --> 01:26:36.299
practices, we see so much variation in terms of

1276
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:40.080
things like how we structure our families, what's considered

1277
01:26:40.089 --> 01:26:44.305
acceptable expressions of love, whether or not love is

1278
01:26:44.314 --> 01:26:47.705
even a factor in marriage, right? So we have

1279
01:26:48.055 --> 01:26:51.904
all sorts of variation with some societies being marriages

1280
01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:54.595
like the and this is what that target article

1281
01:26:54.604 --> 01:26:58.214
was about that the romantic partners, the end all

1282
01:26:58.225 --> 01:27:03.740
be all. It's like every relationship that we could

1283
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:07.240
possibly need our best friend and our lover and

1284
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:11.740
our uh I don't remember what all else they

1285
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:14.319
are, co parent or, you know, all of it.

1286
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:17.669
And what we responded is we said, look, there's

1287
01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:23.640
nothing in evolutionary theory that says that that one

1288
01:27:23.649 --> 01:27:26.979
relationship has to be all those things. What we

1289
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.160
see in evolutionary theory is that we should be

1290
01:27:29.169 --> 01:27:31.250
looking for all of those things. We are looking

1291
01:27:31.259 --> 01:27:36.600
for romantic relation. Connections, we are looking for physical

1292
01:27:36.609 --> 01:27:39.589
connections, we are looking for co-operative connections, we are

1293
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.919
looking for all of these things, but we're supremely

1294
01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:47.720
flexible in how we compile those. And so it's

1295
01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:50.919
true that in, you know, the Western European tradition,

1296
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:54.319
we sort of put all of that onto the

1297
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:58.830
conjugal pair. Um But in other societies, we see

1298
01:27:58.839 --> 01:28:04.040
people taking different pieces of that from different different

1299
01:28:04.049 --> 01:28:09.660
relationships. Um So coupling, is it important? Yes and

1300
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:12.100
no, it depends on how you're defining it, right?

1301
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:15.339
When I define it, when I talk about coupling,

1302
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:21.470
I'm talking about seeking somebody with whom. And this

1303
01:28:21.479 --> 01:28:23.910
is what the the the studies that looked for

1304
01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:26.810
evidence of romantic love cross culturally, some of the

1305
01:28:26.819 --> 01:28:31.020
ways that they identified it is seeking AAA semi

1306
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.919
exclusive or a largely exclusive. Uh um What's the

1307
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:38.529
word I'm looking for connection with somebody else, an

1308
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:43.330
intimate connection with somebody else feeling um an intense

1309
01:28:43.339 --> 01:28:49.270
desire for reciprocal emotion from that person rearranging one's

1310
01:28:49.279 --> 01:28:54.870
priorities for that person. So that is what we're

1311
01:28:54.879 --> 01:28:58.089
talking about in terms of romantic love, in terms

1312
01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.109
of coupling. Here's the thing that I think is

1313
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.049
so cool about it. That doesn't have to be

1314
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:09.490
with the biological parent of your offspring. Doesn't need

1315
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.930
to be with somebody of the opposite sex. Doesn't

1316
01:29:11.939 --> 01:29:16.370
need to be with somebody of reproductive. Yeah, it,

1317
01:29:16.379 --> 01:29:19.189
it can be anybody, it could be, you could

1318
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.839
form that kind of bond with any anybody. And

1319
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:28.180
in different. And again, part of the environment is

1320
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:31.350
the social environment. So we might be more likely

1321
01:29:31.359 --> 01:29:35.109
to form it with different people in different contexts.

1322
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.109
But as a species, we are able to form

1323
01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.109
those kinds of cooper bonds across an incredibly diverse

1324
01:29:44.959 --> 01:29:53.169
array of different kinds of relationships. Um So coupling,

1325
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:57.330
it's important in terms of finding those co-operative partners,

1326
01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:00.669
in terms of assessing it. You know, I, I

1327
01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.049
talked to my undergrads about the gossip columnists, you

1328
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.169
know, the Hollywood gossip columnists and it's like, it

1329
01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.270
seems stupid right, that we should care about the

1330
01:30:11.279 --> 01:30:13.259
sex lives of people that we don't know and

1331
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:16.129
are never gonna meet. But we're people as, you

1332
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.140
know, as a general rule, we're obsessed. Um, I

1333
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:21.439
speak very broadly that way, not you or me,

1334
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:23.609
you know, but we as humans, we, we tend

1335
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:28.759
to be obsessed with this. Um, AND there's reasons

1336
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:33.950
why we should be very attuned to the mateship

1337
01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:38.390
of others is that person in some sort of,

1338
01:30:38.859 --> 01:30:42.270
especially if it's a, a sexual relationship because we

1339
01:30:42.279 --> 01:30:46.410
have both potential mates for ourselves and potential competitors,

1340
01:30:46.509 --> 01:30:49.779
either competitors for the same mate we want or

1341
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:53.709
competitors trying to maybe take away our mate. Um

1342
01:30:53.919 --> 01:30:56.669
And so we're, we are, we're like, really obsessed

1343
01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:02.910
with information cues to, is this person already in

1344
01:31:02.919 --> 01:31:05.180
a partnership? Are they a threat to me? Are

1345
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:07.520
they a potential benefit to me, all of those

1346
01:31:07.529 --> 01:31:12.350
kinds of things? Um, BUT definitely there is not

1347
01:31:12.359 --> 01:31:14.689
a one size fits all. So if we say

1348
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.509
that, yeah, humans have adaptations to form co-operative romantic

1349
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.890
relationships. That is, you know, in no way saying

1350
01:31:23.899 --> 01:31:27.919
that, oh yes, humans evolved to have uh nuclear

1351
01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:31.209
families with one father, one mother and 2.5 Children.

1352
01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:35.410
Um, THAT'S just, that's not the conclusion.

1353
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:40.250
No. And the, that bit about, uh, there's not,

1354
01:31:40.259 --> 01:31:43.250
no one size that fits all is very interesting

1355
01:31:43.259 --> 01:31:46.850
because I, I mean, I, I also get very

1356
01:31:46.859 --> 01:31:50.729
bothered when, for example, people start discussing and by

1357
01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:55.810
people, I even mean, academics sometimes start discussing mating

1358
01:31:55.819 --> 01:32:00.500
systems in humans because then, uh, I mean, a

1359
01:32:00.509 --> 01:32:04.410
and sometimes it's very obvious that, uh, people who

1360
01:32:04.419 --> 01:32:08.250
put for certain arguments is just because they themselves

1361
01:32:08.259 --> 01:32:12.020
tend to prefer a particular mating system like, oh,

1362
01:32:12.029 --> 01:32:15.810
I'm polyamory. Oh, I'm monogamous. And then here's the

1363
01:32:15.819 --> 01:32:19.669
evidence for humans being monogamous, here's the evidence for

1364
01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.500
humans being polyamory. And I'm, and I'm just like,

1365
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:28.020
look, just get, just get over it, do whatever

1366
01:32:28.029 --> 01:32:31.750
you want. And, but then, I mean, it doesn't

1367
01:32:31.759 --> 01:32:35.330
make any sense for me at least to say

1368
01:32:35.339 --> 01:32:39.509
that humans have evolved as a monogamous species or

1369
01:32:39.584 --> 01:32:43.205
poly amorous species or a polygynous species because it

1370
01:32:43.214 --> 01:32:47.524
depends again on ecology, on economy on, I mean,

1371
01:32:47.535 --> 01:32:51.924
individual preferences or, I mean, why are people so

1372
01:32:51.935 --> 01:32:53.845
obsessed with

1373
01:32:53.854 --> 01:32:57.569
it? It really is. Yeah. No, it really is

1374
01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.500
funny and it's, it's, you know, people are, they

1375
01:33:00.509 --> 01:33:02.540
like, and I remember this again, going, you know,

1376
01:33:02.549 --> 01:33:04.240
again, going back, way to the dark ages of

1377
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:06.910
when I was an undergraduate. Um, I remember sort

1378
01:33:06.919 --> 01:33:09.750
of being like, yeah, man, you know, fight, fight

1379
01:33:09.759 --> 01:33:12.830
the fight the system. Humans really weren't designed to

1380
01:33:12.839 --> 01:33:18.149
be monogamous. Um, REALLY it turns out, you know,

1381
01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.419
I mean, so here's how I would put it,

1382
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:23.080
say humans are designed to be much more monogamous

1383
01:33:23.089 --> 01:33:28.310
than almost any other mammal. Um Really, I mean,

1384
01:33:28.319 --> 01:33:31.939
you know, and we're designed to be much more

1385
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:38.819
likely to form long term bonds and have paternal

1386
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:42.850
investment in those offspring than almost any other mammals.

1387
01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:49.700
Um But no, you can't say that that humans

1388
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:52.229
are, you know, evolved to be monogamous or polygamous

1389
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.709
or poly and whatever poly amorous. Iii I don't,

1390
01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.009
I hate, I shouldn't say that I hate the

1391
01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:02.750
term poly amorous and I, I hate it only

1392
01:34:02.759 --> 01:34:04.930
because I, I feel like we already had that

1393
01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:08.089
term. Um WHICH is polygamy. I don't anyway, it

1394
01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:13.509
doesn't matter. Um It's, it's after 2 a.m. here.

1395
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.930
So I'm, I'm starting to, you know, get a

1396
01:34:15.939 --> 01:34:21.069
little punchy. Um But uh to get back to

1397
01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.520
that one of the things. So I tell my,

1398
01:34:22.529 --> 01:34:24.759
my students, so I'm teaching this and my anthropology

1399
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:26.470
of sex and gender class and I do teach

1400
01:34:26.479 --> 01:34:29.109
them, you know, the, the primary mating system, I

1401
01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:37.109
got four primary mating systems, polygamy, polyandry, polygynandry, um

1402
01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:41.319
multi male, multi female and monogamy, right? And, and

1403
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:42.750
I tell them that, you know, if we look

1404
01:34:42.759 --> 01:34:46.910
across humans, certainly there's evidence of pair bonding. We've

1405
01:34:46.919 --> 01:34:49.770
got tons of evidence of pair bonding, including things

1406
01:34:49.779 --> 01:34:53.109
like reduced sexual dimorphism. Um You know, all all

1407
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.060
sorts of things that suggest that we definitely have

1408
01:34:56.790 --> 01:35:00.370
an evolutionary history of para bonding. We also definitely

1409
01:35:00.379 --> 01:35:03.569
have lots of evidence of an evolutionary history of

1410
01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:07.979
sperm competition, right? That it certainly we do not

1411
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:11.490
have any clear evidence of an evolutionary history of

1412
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:17.470
strict monogamy, certainly not strict sexual monogamy. Um We

1413
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:22.310
in terms of polyandry, right? We basically look like

1414
01:35:22.319 --> 01:35:25.310
all other species, which is that the populations where

1415
01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:29.029
we see polyandry, except in humans, we're all humans,

1416
01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.279
right? Most other species, we see these variations at

1417
01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:34.939
the species level. But where we see polyandry, it's

1418
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:39.560
usually because the resources are really scarce and there's

1419
01:35:39.569 --> 01:35:44.950
not, there's not enough for one woman plus one

1420
01:35:44.959 --> 01:35:48.959
partner to raise offspring. So, what do we see?

1421
01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:53.149
We see men partnering up and almost always, no

1422
01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.129
more than two and almost always brothers, right? This

1423
01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.939
is the same thing that we see in poly

1424
01:35:58.959 --> 01:36:02.270
polyandrous, nonhuman species. Um

1425
01:36:02.279 --> 01:36:05.549
And that's mostly because of paternity, uncertainty.

1426
01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.569
Right. Exactly. It's like, so, so what males are

1427
01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:12.029
doing any sexually reproducing males, if they're sharing a

1428
01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:15.979
female partner, they're basically cutting the reproductive potential in

1429
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:18.209
half. And this is particularly true of mammals because

1430
01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.799
again, in mammals, they're really, you know, there's, I

1431
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:24.129
know, again, people are, are revisiting these ideas of

1432
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.240
obligate parental investment. But I'm like, come on, in

1433
01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:32.000
mammals, there's at least a baseline, really big difference.

1434
01:36:32.299 --> 01:36:34.729
Um, IN humans, it's definitely, I'm like, all bets

1435
01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.330
are off because even defining what obligate parental investment

1436
01:36:38.339 --> 01:36:43.930
is, is, is nearly impossible. Right? I mean, is

1437
01:36:43.939 --> 01:36:47.319
it, should we consider it obligate to get the

1438
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:50.310
appropriate social inputs? I mean, I think so because

1439
01:36:50.319 --> 01:36:54.120
Children don't develop normally if they don't have that.

1440
01:36:54.279 --> 01:36:56.540
So, you know, I mean, there's anyway, just even

1441
01:36:56.549 --> 01:36:59.180
defining what obligate parental investment is in humans is

1442
01:36:59.189 --> 01:37:04.640
difficult and then what, you know, men can provide

1443
01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:06.509
and what women can provide. But most of it

1444
01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.209
past lactation is not at all female specific, right?

1445
01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:13.540
And again, our Children are dependent until their mid

1446
01:37:13.549 --> 01:37:16.529
to late teens. So clearly, males have plenty of

1447
01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:22.229
opportunity to be incredibly important uh in investing in

1448
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.870
offspring. But the only, the only mating system and

1449
01:37:25.879 --> 01:37:28.770
this goes back to the polyamory thing. The only

1450
01:37:28.779 --> 01:37:32.669
mating system that we have really no evidence that

1451
01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.020
humans have ever been any good at is polygynandry.

1452
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.870
Uh MULTI male, multi mating um mating systems. We're

1453
01:37:40.879 --> 01:37:43.100
terrible at it. We keep trying to do it.

1454
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:46.580
People really want to do it every generation. There's

1455
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:50.930
like, you know, a new invention of free love

1456
01:37:50.939 --> 01:37:55.020
societies or, you know, poly amorous societies, whatever people

1457
01:37:55.029 --> 01:37:57.240
love the idea of it and they keep trying

1458
01:37:57.250 --> 01:38:01.660
to make it happen, but they all fail. Um

1459
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:06.189
They, they don't persist and they don't persist because

1460
01:38:06.939 --> 01:38:09.990
even though we love the idea of being able

1461
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.120
to have as many mates as we want and

1462
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:15.419
the ones that we want, we really don't like

1463
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:17.290
the idea of our partners being able to do

1464
01:38:17.299 --> 01:38:23.410
that and frankly, males even more so than females.

1465
01:38:23.419 --> 01:38:27.770
Right. So, these poly amorous today, it's poly amorous

1466
01:38:28.479 --> 01:38:30.629
in the seventies. In the sixties it was free.

1467
01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.910
Love communes, right. Um, THEY, they fall apart. They,

1468
01:38:34.919 --> 01:38:37.830
they, you know, almost always fall apart pretty quickly.

1469
01:38:38.089 --> 01:38:42.109
Um And it's usually due to jealousy. Um And,

1470
01:38:42.279 --> 01:38:45.310
and again, that's evidence that we do have adaptations

1471
01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:49.950
to form attachments to form these sorts of pair

1472
01:38:49.959 --> 01:38:56.569
bonds. Um Again, no particular way. There's massive amounts

1473
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:59.529
of latitude in what that looks like and what

1474
01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:03.589
it, how it's expressed, but we definitely have adaptations

1475
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.890
to form feelings of. I want this person for

1476
01:39:07.899 --> 01:39:08.229
me.

1477
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:12.459
Yeah. A a and I mean, since I score

1478
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:15.720
very low on agreeableness, I know that you want

1479
01:39:15.729 --> 01:39:18.339
to be a little bit more diplomatic here when

1480
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:21.439
it comes to polyamory. But uh I'm going to

1481
01:39:21.450 --> 01:39:24.379
say it straight out. I, I mean, just cut

1482
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:28.589
the BS because it basically always falls back on

1483
01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.339
polygyny.

1484
01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:36.979
Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely. Um Yeah, men, men, men

1485
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:40.549
do not like to share their women. So,

1486
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:45.370
so, yeah, le let's leave it at that. But

1487
01:39:45.439 --> 01:39:47.310
I, I also don't want to

1488
01:39:47.319 --> 01:39:47.450
be

1489
01:39:47.479 --> 01:39:50.290
polyamory people too much. But

1490
01:39:50.299 --> 01:39:53.049
anyway, well, and here's the thing too is I

1491
01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.089
would say, you know, what if you're into polyamory?

1492
01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.729
Great. That's great. Go for live your best life.

1493
01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.649
Um, I, you know, I just did it. I,

1494
01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.490
I don't, I'm not optimistic. It will last as

1495
01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.009
long as you think it might.

1496
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:05.879
Yeah, me, me neither.

1497
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.250
And,

1498
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:09.439
and anyway, I, I don't want to make you

1499
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:13.654
stay up until 3 a.m. because here in Portugal

1500
01:40:13.665 --> 01:40:16.415
it's the morning. So, uh, not a problem at

1501
01:40:16.424 --> 01:40:18.845
all for me. But a anyway, let's get just

1502
01:40:18.854 --> 01:40:21.084
into one last topic and going all the way

1503
01:40:21.095 --> 01:40:24.095
back to one of the first points we talked

1504
01:40:24.104 --> 01:40:27.575
about when we were talking about the sure and

1505
01:40:27.584 --> 01:40:32.075
gender roles. Uh How do you approach sex and

1506
01:40:32.084 --> 01:40:37.564
gender as an anthropologist and also from an evolutionary

1507
01:40:37.575 --> 01:40:38.484
perspective.

1508
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:44.149
So, first of all, uh you know, in my,

1509
01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.609
in my head, um those two things, I, I

1510
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.890
really, to me it's the, the, the tri triumvirate

1511
01:40:51.899 --> 01:40:59.029
of sex, gender and sexuality and they're all associated

1512
01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.140
with one another, but they're not the same thing.

1513
01:41:02.339 --> 01:41:06.160
So, and they're important for different things and in

1514
01:41:06.169 --> 01:41:09.680
different contexts. Um A lot of which were just

1515
01:41:09.689 --> 01:41:15.160
barely beginning to really untangle. So sex is a

1516
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:20.569
real biological thing. Um The, you know, that are

1517
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.979
there only two, no, there's definitely more than two.

1518
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:28.629
Although the vast majority of humans fall into one

1519
01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.040
of two primary sexes, 90 more than 99%. Um

1520
01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:36.850
And how do we, how am I defining the

1521
01:41:36.859 --> 01:41:42.049
sexes? I'm defining that in really biological terms, which

1522
01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:47.620
is, you know, uh uh the chromosome chromosomes is

1523
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:50.560
the most basic. But you can also look at

1524
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:55.229
um e external indicators of chromosomes which are genitalia,

1525
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.930
which of course, there's not a perfect 1 to

1526
01:41:56.939 --> 01:42:00.770
1 association. But again, there's a very, very, very

1527
01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:06.580
strong correlation um in more than 90% of humans,

1528
01:42:07.259 --> 01:42:09.160
what you see on the outside when they're born

1529
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:12.899
matches what their chromosomes are not all people. Right.

1530
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:18.799
So again, absolutely. People that don't have XX or

1531
01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:24.140
XY are real people. They exist, you know, they

1532
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:26.060
are real people and they are part of the

1533
01:42:26.069 --> 01:42:30.180
human variation. Um But it is also true that

1534
01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.359
the vast majority have either XX or XY and

1535
01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.729
uh uh

1536
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.779
sorry to interrupt. But also people who have XX

1537
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:45.060
or XY but do not develop the corresponding uh

1538
01:42:45.069 --> 01:42:50.819
secondary sexual characteristics and might identify as the opposite

1539
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:51.939
gender, for example.

1540
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:54.100
Absolutely. So, and again, I would say that there's,

1541
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:56.240
there's still a couple of different things there. So

1542
01:42:56.250 --> 01:43:00.750
you're talking about first, the, the developmental cor physical

1543
01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:06.209
developmental correlates of chromosomal sex. So secondary sexual characteristics

1544
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:12.049
and we again is really clear, it's really obvious

1545
01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:16.640
that humans are sexually dimorphic. We're only mildly sexually

1546
01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:19.250
dimorphic in size. But, you know, it's, it's a

1547
01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:21.970
very simple thought experiment. I tell, you know, again,

1548
01:43:21.979 --> 01:43:24.850
I tell this to my students, I'm like, imagine

1549
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:28.520
a bunch of babies, male and female babies just

1550
01:43:28.529 --> 01:43:32.629
wearing diapers um, and no adornments, no hair. No,

1551
01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.899
nothing. Right. Just diapers. So you're just covering their

1552
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:37.669
genitals. You know, could you sort them into male

1553
01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.459
and female and some of them think they could.

1554
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:42.080
But I'm like, I'm here to tell you you

1555
01:43:42.089 --> 01:43:44.649
couldn't, you know, you would, you would be at

1556
01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.379
chance, um, sorting infants that have their genitals covered.

1557
01:43:50.259 --> 01:43:54.640
However, if you think about adults, adult humans wearing

1558
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:58.390
just something to cover their genitals and again, remember

1559
01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:01.629
genitals is just the lower part. Um EVEN if

1560
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:06.720
we remove all other extraneous stuff, hair, right? Make

1561
01:44:06.729 --> 01:44:08.450
up any of those kinds of things, any of

1562
01:44:08.459 --> 01:44:14.709
the cultural indicators of sex, you would have like

1563
01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.680
a 90% success rate in identifying males versus females

1564
01:44:19.689 --> 01:44:24.319
at least, right? Um So humans are definitely sexually

1565
01:44:24.330 --> 01:44:31.410
dimorphic and again, those dimorphic body shapes largely correlate

1566
01:44:32.339 --> 01:44:36.529
with the chromosomes. Ok. So that's two parts. So

1567
01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:40.479
far we've got, you know, the internal biology and

1568
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:45.379
chemistry and we've got the external phenotypic traits. Now,

1569
01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:50.080
the part that I think gets into gender is

1570
01:44:50.089 --> 01:44:55.419
the expression of maleness and femaleness and this is

1571
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:58.990
where it starts getting really super messy. Um IN

1572
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.399
part because here there, it's not categorical at all.

1573
01:45:05.410 --> 01:45:11.569
So sex, I would argue is fundamentally fundamentally categorical.

1574
01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:15.229
Is it binary? No, there's definitely more than two,

1575
01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:21.370
but it's definitely still fundamentally categorical. Um WHEREAS gender

1576
01:45:21.379 --> 01:45:27.959
is fundamentally continuous, it is, there is no masculine

1577
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:34.500
and feminine. There's ranges around masculine and feminine and

1578
01:45:34.509 --> 01:45:35.740
there's, oh, sorry, go ahead.

1579
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:37.669
Let me just ask you this just to see

1580
01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.970
if you would agree with this point or not.

1581
01:45:39.979 --> 01:45:44.529
But, uh, I mean, of course, across societies, there's

1582
01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:49.669
many different ways of expressing, uh, gender binary. I

1583
01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.000
mean, what it means to be a woman or

1584
01:45:52.009 --> 01:45:55.319
a man across different societies in terms of how

1585
01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:57.740
they dress, how they present, how they behave and

1586
01:45:57.750 --> 01:46:00.669
so on. I mean, it varies. But uh e

1587
01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.899
even if we have uh uh a general binary

1588
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:08.109
across societies, I mean, in the, if it, and

1589
01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.990
even if it's different from sex, that uh whatever

1590
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.200
it is that a man or a woman means

1591
01:46:16.209 --> 01:46:18.899
in the society you live in, it's still the

1592
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:23.000
case that there's a very high degree of correlation

1593
01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:27.490
between your sex and you white and defining as

1594
01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:31.879
a man or a woman and behaving and presenting

1595
01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:34.209
as a man or a woman according to the

1596
01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:35.950
norms in the society.

1597
01:46:36.899 --> 01:46:39.660
So again, there's, there's actually multiple different levels to

1598
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:42.839
be thinking about that because there are some gender

1599
01:46:42.850 --> 01:46:48.399
traits that really do appear to be pretty consistent

1600
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.870
across cultures and across time. Um So for example,

1601
01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.189
we show homicide data which is really dark one

1602
01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.069
to show. But you know, if we look at

1603
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:07.750
homicide data across cultures, cross continents. Historically, we see

1604
01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:11.640
what looks like exactly the same pattern in the

1605
01:47:11.649 --> 01:47:14.160
data again and again and again, which is this

1606
01:47:14.169 --> 01:47:18.799
big spike in homicide Commission. Um HOMICIDE commission by

1607
01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:23.350
males uh in the late teens, early twenties that

1608
01:47:23.359 --> 01:47:27.560
then drops back off and it's massively higher than

1609
01:47:27.569 --> 01:47:31.640
any point. The the female commission of, of homicide,

1610
01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.410
what differs. And this is why, you know, again,

1611
01:47:34.419 --> 01:47:38.209
I love these data because it shows so clearly

1612
01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:44.640
that culture definitely matters because the overall rates vary

1613
01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:49.020
enormously. Right. You can look at, oh God, I'm

1614
01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:51.240
gonna pull this from my, my memory and I'm,

1615
01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:54.520
I, I actually have Dyscalculia which means I'm not

1616
01:47:54.529 --> 01:47:57.069
good with numbers at all. I can't keep them

1617
01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.439
straight. I'm gonna try and do it. And this

1618
01:47:58.450 --> 01:48:00.000
is from memory. So we'll see how I do.

1619
01:48:00.250 --> 01:48:02.899
And it was like the comparison of the Canadian

1620
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:06.720
data to the Chicago data and the big difference

1621
01:48:06.729 --> 01:48:09.709
was the overall homicide rate in Canada. It was

1622
01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.529
something like it maxed out at something like 30

1623
01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:16.899
something I wanna say per million per year. Maybe

1624
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:17.810
it was a little more than that. I wanna

1625
01:48:17.819 --> 01:48:20.640
say it was in 30 something and in Chicago

1626
01:48:20.649 --> 01:48:25.810
it was like 1000 or 3000, you know, something

1627
01:48:25.819 --> 01:48:29.140
in the thousands per million per year. So culture

1628
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:34.279
matters, right? Massively different rates of homicide. But the

1629
01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:37.729
magnitude of difference between men and women was the

1630
01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:41.970
same, the age pattern was the same, right? And

1631
01:48:41.979 --> 01:48:43.859
that's, you know, again and again and again and

1632
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:46.930
again, small scale societies, large scale societies, you know,

1633
01:48:46.939 --> 01:48:51.000
all over the place, same pattern. So some things

1634
01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:55.479
that, that we would consider gender do appear to

1635
01:48:55.490 --> 01:49:00.390
be related to maleness and femaleness. And those are

1636
01:49:00.399 --> 01:49:02.939
likely to be those things that would have been

1637
01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:08.910
really differentially important to male or female reproductive success

1638
01:49:08.919 --> 01:49:11.720
on average over evolutionary history. Right? So there's, it's

1639
01:49:11.729 --> 01:49:14.390
not, it's not an accident that males are more

1640
01:49:14.399 --> 01:49:18.189
likely to commit homicide. It's because over evolutionary history,

1641
01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.160
the context of male competition for reproductive success would

1642
01:49:23.169 --> 01:49:30.509
have favored much more uh direct physical strategies, um

1643
01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.189
competitive strategies. Um So, so we do see some

1644
01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:39.160
of these universals at some level of generality. But

1645
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:40.919
then as you said, there's other things that are

1646
01:49:40.930 --> 01:49:45.240
like, there's just no pattern at all. Right. So

1647
01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:48.839
whether I whether we wear clothing on the bottom

1648
01:49:48.850 --> 01:49:52.120
half that has one opening for both our legs

1649
01:49:52.129 --> 01:49:54.990
or one leg and opening for each leg, right.

1650
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.669
So skirts or pants, um there's, there's, you know,

1651
01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:02.569
there's no predicting who's gonna wear what, in what

1652
01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.839
society, it's all over the place. In some places,

1653
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:07.899
both men and women wear clothes that have an

1654
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:10.209
opening for each leg and some, they both wear

1655
01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:13.080
clothes that have only one opening for both legs.

1656
01:50:13.089 --> 01:50:17.779
I mean, even just in western society just look

1657
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:22.040
at paintings of men from the 18th century.

1658
01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:27.979
Right. Right. And even things like, you know, some

1659
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:29.879
of the things that we might think of as

1660
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:35.470
really like masculine, feminine, like being emotionally expressive. Yeah,

1661
01:50:35.479 --> 01:50:37.430
actually, that turns out to be a lot more

1662
01:50:37.439 --> 01:50:40.839
variable Right. It's not nearly as clear as something

1663
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:45.169
like the, the homicide data. Um, SO there's a

1664
01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:49.680
lot of things that are much more culturally defined

1665
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:51.770
but as you said, what's interesting about and, and,

1666
01:50:51.779 --> 01:50:54.350
and, and what's interesting also when we look into,

1667
01:50:54.359 --> 01:51:01.339
look at societies that recognize additional, like, uh, uh,

1668
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:07.910
additional sexes or genders. Right. So, um, they used

1669
01:51:07.919 --> 01:51:09.919
to be, we used to call them third sex.

1670
01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:14.029
Uh, uh, um, OH my God. See, here it

1671
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.660
is. It's so late. I can't, my words are

1672
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:17.709
just like gone. We used to talk about them

1673
01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.839
as um size that, that uh recognized third sexes.

1674
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:24.419
It's even more complicated than that, right? But if

1675
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:28.830
I could summarize as cultures in which there is

1676
01:51:28.839 --> 01:51:34.109
recognized more than two sexes. Um And there's a

1677
01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.390
lot of them, right? There's a lot of examples

1678
01:51:36.399 --> 01:51:37.319
of this. So

1679
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:40.209
an example of that be the fafa f in

1680
01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:40.859
Samoa.

1681
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:45.600
Yep. Absolutely. The Affine, the, uh the Hira in

1682
01:51:45.609 --> 01:51:50.040
India, the moche in Mexico. Um There's like I

1683
01:51:50.049 --> 01:51:53.029
said, there's lots of examples, two spirit people, which

1684
01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.740
is the, the term that's sort of, of course,

1685
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:58.799
that one's really confusing because it's a term that's

1686
01:51:58.810 --> 01:52:02.770
used across Native American nationalities, but it means different

1687
01:52:02.779 --> 01:52:05.299
things in different contexts. Anyway, we'll leave that one

1688
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:11.259
aside. So even in cultures where they very clearly

1689
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:17.979
recognize third or more sexes or genders, they still

1690
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:23.419
very clearly recognize men and women as well. Right.

1691
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:27.979
So there's no place that I know of, um,

1692
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:33.629
where there's no concept of men and women and,

1693
01:52:33.839 --> 01:52:38.750
and also they still make a distinction between female

1694
01:52:38.759 --> 01:52:42.729
traits and male traits because even if they're talking

1695
01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:48.149
about feminine men or masculine women or two spirited

1696
01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.049
people, I mean, they're still recognizing that they have

1697
01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:55.345
more fe or male traits, more female traits are

1698
01:52:55.354 --> 01:52:56.535
a mix of both.

1699
01:52:56.865 --> 01:53:01.225
Right. Right. Right. Exactly. So, it's like, inherent in

1700
01:53:01.234 --> 01:53:07.134
recognizing the diversity of gender expression is understanding the

1701
01:53:07.145 --> 01:53:11.975
patterns of gender expression, right? If there weren't patterns,

1702
01:53:11.984 --> 01:53:16.140
none of that would be anything we talk about.

1703
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:21.250
Right. Um So yeah, so there's definitely, you know,

1704
01:53:21.259 --> 01:53:23.689
and even when I talk about in anthropology, we

1705
01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.620
talk about the gender division of labor or the

1706
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:29.799
sexual division of labor. And one of the things

1707
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:32.399
that I try to impart to my students is

1708
01:53:32.410 --> 01:53:37.500
that the existence of a sexual division of labor

1709
01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.589
is absolutely universal. It exists in every human society

1710
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.430
that we have any record of. But what varies

1711
01:53:46.439 --> 01:53:50.689
is the extent of the sexual division of labor.

1712
01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:54.160
So, for example, in some societies, absolutely everything is

1713
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:59.279
gendered, right? Um Women's lives are comprised of this

1714
01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:01.490
stuff and men's lives of this stuff and never

1715
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:06.759
the Twain shall meet in other societies. Almost everything

1716
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:09.450
is not gendered, but there might be a couple

1717
01:54:09.459 --> 01:54:11.810
of things, right? Like this is really considered something

1718
01:54:11.819 --> 01:54:13.589
that women do and this is really something that's

1719
01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.240
considered that men do. Um So that can vary.

1720
01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:21.649
The, the uh strictness of the division of labor,

1721
01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:23.509
the sexual division of labor can vary. So, in

1722
01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:27.649
some places it's like, you know, incredibly bad if

1723
01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:32.379
you do something that's outside of your gender professions,

1724
01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.990
in other places, it's, you know, it's like uh

1725
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.410
yeah, usually men do that but you're a woman

1726
01:54:37.419 --> 01:54:39.790
and you're doing it. So it's not that big

1727
01:54:39.799 --> 01:54:45.189
of a deal. Um So that varies and uh

1728
01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.919
one other thing, so I saw the, the ubiquity

1729
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:52.000
of them. Um, OH, and the importance there is

1730
01:54:52.009 --> 01:54:56.229
one other thing that I usually identify. Um, BUT

1731
01:54:56.379 --> 01:54:59.339
anyway, so there is a sexual division of labor

1732
01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:08.399
everywhere which again is a recognition of gendered activities.

1733
01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.520
But, oh, and the content of them, that was

1734
01:55:10.529 --> 01:55:12.310
the thing. That was the third thing, the content

1735
01:55:12.319 --> 01:55:14.580
of them. So, you know, in some places, basket

1736
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:17.180
making is men's work, in some places, basket making

1737
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:20.609
is women's work. Um There are a, so if

1738
01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:24.560
you look at, uh, Bobby Lowe, um, has, uh,

1739
01:55:24.569 --> 01:55:32.220
identified, um, a number of activities that are almost

1740
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:36.540
universally, uh, male dominated. Um And there are very

1741
01:55:36.549 --> 01:55:39.879
few that are almost universally female dominated outside of

1742
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:44.109
child care. Um But there are several that seem

1743
01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:48.729
to be almost universally dominated by men, um, that

1744
01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:53.000
include things like large game hunting, um, and, uh,

1745
01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.819
metal working, I think was one of them. Uh,

1746
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:57.240
AND,

1747
01:55:57.370 --> 01:55:57.520
and

1748
01:55:57.529 --> 01:55:58.069
also,

1749
01:55:58.419 --> 01:56:00.339
uh, I mean, let me just ask you this,

1750
01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:03.600
uh, unless I'm mistaken. But I guess that we

1751
01:56:03.609 --> 01:56:06.990
can also say that even the sexual division of

1752
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.879
labor is not completely uh inflexible, right? Because for

1753
01:56:11.890 --> 01:56:16.080
example, uh there are certain activities like just in

1754
01:56:16.089 --> 01:56:19.859
the West, uh up till the Second World War,

1755
01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:22.879
it was common for uh for people to think

1756
01:56:22.890 --> 01:56:27.319
that working in factories was mostly a male job.

1757
01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:30.600
But then due to the lack of males after

1758
01:56:30.609 --> 01:56:33.009
the Second World War, there were lots and lots

1759
01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.953
and lots of women working in factories and that

1760
01:56:35.962 --> 01:56:39.413
was considered perfectly normal. And I mean, many other

1761
01:56:39.422 --> 01:56:43.612
activities that since the emancipation of women in the

1762
01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:48.692
seventies opened up to women participation. And now we

1763
01:56:48.703 --> 01:56:52.073
just think it's perfectly normal for women to be

1764
01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:53.893
doctors and so on.

1765
01:56:54.092 --> 01:56:56.393
Right. No, and that's exactly the point, right? That,

1766
01:56:56.402 --> 01:56:59.965
that flexibility that, that both it can vary between

1767
01:56:59.976 --> 01:57:03.666
cultures, but also it varies over time. Um And

1768
01:57:03.675 --> 01:57:06.306
so yeah, it's not at all static. It's not

1769
01:57:06.315 --> 01:57:08.306
that, you know, yes, women do this and men

1770
01:57:08.315 --> 01:57:12.025
do that and it, it never changes. Um It

1771
01:57:12.036 --> 01:57:14.755
can change a lot, it can change frequently, can

1772
01:57:14.766 --> 01:57:17.585
change very quickly. One of the things that is

1773
01:57:17.596 --> 01:57:21.125
really interesting and we can see this very easily

1774
01:57:21.136 --> 01:57:24.585
in our own uh culture and history is that

1775
01:57:24.596 --> 01:57:30.220
very often tasks which are considered women's work as

1776
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:35.640
soon as they become profitable or high status, become

1777
01:57:35.649 --> 01:57:39.419
men's work. Um So I'm not kidding though. Right.

1778
01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:42.810
You were laughing. II I wasn't laughing because I

1779
01:57:42.819 --> 01:57:44.689
thought you were kid. It was just that,

1780
01:57:45.310 --> 01:57:48.660
I know it is. It's funny and it's so

1781
01:57:48.669 --> 01:57:51.319
obvious. Right. So we look at, you know, here

1782
01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:56.359
in the USA generation ago, right. Elementary school teachers

1783
01:57:56.370 --> 01:58:00.379
were women, college professors were men. Right. Waitresses were

1784
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:04.879
women made ds were men, seamstresses were women, clothing,

1785
01:58:04.890 --> 01:58:07.279
designers were men. Right? I mean, it's like we

1786
01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:09.339
see it again and again and again, who takes

1787
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:12.290
care of six people in the home, women who

1788
01:58:12.299 --> 01:58:15.180
gets paid big bucks to be a doctor, men.

1789
01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:16.490
So,

1790
01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:20.029
and, and also, I mean, even the idea of

1791
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:24.810
the traditional idea that women cook, I mean, now

1792
01:58:24.819 --> 01:58:29.200
you have very famous male chefs, but why? Because

1793
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:31.439
it pays a lot to be a famous

1794
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.410
chef? And do you know how hard it is

1795
01:58:34.419 --> 01:58:38.779
for women to break into that really high end

1796
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:44.560
chef career? It's like the women are incredibly underrepresented.

1797
01:58:45.029 --> 01:58:46.580
It's, you know, and again, it's one of those

1798
01:58:46.589 --> 01:58:50.669
things, it's like, it's, it's almost stunning in its

1799
01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.830
obviousness

1800
01:58:51.850 --> 01:58:53.620
you think you would like to have?

1801
01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:57.859
Uh um, DID you just ask me anything? I'd

1802
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:58.589
like to add?

1803
01:59:00.979 --> 01:59:01.450
I mean,

1804
01:59:01.459 --> 01:59:04.910
what I could talk all night, right?

1805
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:08.660
I mean, we can, we can also schedule a

1806
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:13.109
second interview to talk just about the anthropology of

1807
01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.529
sex and gender. I mean, I would

1808
01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.959
love, no, it is, it's, it's a fascinating topic

1809
01:59:17.970 --> 01:59:19.379
and I think, you know, and I think that

1810
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:23.419
we're really at an interesting time where we starting

1811
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:29.720
to recognize so much more that sex and gender

1812
01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:34.979
are likely having different effects on different things. And

1813
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:37.009
I think we're at a, you know, at a

1814
01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:40.319
time in history where we really have to revisit

1815
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:46.040
when and why knowing somebody's sex matters. I would

1816
01:59:46.049 --> 01:59:48.979
argue that it definitely does for a lot of

1817
01:59:48.990 --> 01:59:52.350
things, primarily health related things, right? All of our

1818
01:59:52.359 --> 01:59:55.330
cells, every single one of our cells is a,

1819
01:59:55.339 --> 01:59:57.919
has a sex has, you know, because it has

1820
01:59:58.979 --> 02:00:03.479
our sex chromosomes, xxxy or some other variant, right?

1821
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.399
Every single one of

1822
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:07.660
our, I guess that even socially, I mean, we

1823
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:10.779
have to understand that it matters for people to

1824
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:13.470
really be able to distinguish between men and women

1825
02:00:13.479 --> 02:00:17.350
because since we are a sexually reproducing species, I,

1826
02:00:17.359 --> 02:00:21.220
I mean, you want to be attracted to, uh,

1827
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:24.100
whoever you are attracted to.

1828
02:00:24.319 --> 02:00:27.029
Right. Right. Well, in addition to that, you know,

1829
02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.600
one of the things and i, it's funny because

1830
02:00:30.609 --> 02:00:33.839
no, people don't like to answer this question very

1831
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:37.160
honestly. But I ask my students, I say, you

1832
02:00:37.169 --> 02:00:40.060
know, if you are walking back to your car

1833
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:45.720
across campus late at night, all alone. Right. And

1834
02:00:45.729 --> 02:00:49.399
you hear somebody walking behind you, do you care

1835
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:52.540
if it's a man or a woman? And everybody

1836
02:00:52.549 --> 02:00:54.339
wants to say no, no, no, I don't care.

1837
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:56.770
I don't care. And I'm like, really, really, you

1838
02:00:56.779 --> 02:01:01.129
don't care. You, you should care, you should care

1839
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:06.330
because here's the thing, even though if it's a

1840
02:01:06.339 --> 02:01:08.890
man, there's almost no chance that he's gonna do

1841
02:01:08.899 --> 02:01:10.729
anything. So he's probably also just trying to get

1842
02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:13.669
back to his car and go home. Right. But

1843
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:17.209
it's a much higher chance that you're gonna have

1844
02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:22.450
some sort of antagonistic interaction with a man than

1845
02:01:22.459 --> 02:01:25.810
with a woman. Right? So, even leaving, you know,

1846
02:01:25.819 --> 02:01:29.660
finding a mate aside, you should care whether you're

1847
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:33.290
a man or a woman, right? On average men

1848
02:01:33.299 --> 02:01:37.390
pose greater risks. Now again, does that mean that

1849
02:01:37.399 --> 02:01:39.549
women are all nice and sweet? No, of course

1850
02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.589
not. Does it mean that women can't mug you?

1851
02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:44.470
They can, they don't do it as often. Um

1852
02:01:44.479 --> 02:01:46.549
You know, uh does it mean that most men

1853
02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.359
are gonna mug you? No, of course not. Most

1854
02:01:48.370 --> 02:01:50.609
men are totally not gonna do anything to you.

1855
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:56.319
But on average over evolutionary history, knowing somebody's sex

1856
02:01:57.189 --> 02:02:00.790
gave you a lot of information about what kind

1857
02:02:00.799 --> 02:02:04.240
of interaction you might have. So, you know, I'm

1858
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:08.729
not at all ready to throw out the sex

1859
02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:10.430
baby with the bathwater. I don't know how that

1860
02:02:10.439 --> 02:02:15.770
goes. But, but I do think that there's also

1861
02:02:15.779 --> 02:02:17.629
a lot of things that, you know, I think

1862
02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:23.549
more and more we're saying, oh, this thing, whatever

1863
02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:29.790
it is, whether it's uh you know, worldview or

1864
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:36.180
parenting approaches, um maybe more related to gender, to

1865
02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:39.330
our gender, our expression of gender than to our

1866
02:02:39.339 --> 02:02:43.580
sex. And it may be more profitable, profitable in

1867
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:47.580
the terms of, in terms of being able to

1868
02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:52.680
predict and a, uh you know, address problems in

1869
02:02:52.689 --> 02:02:57.930
the world um that to assess people's gender rather

1870
02:02:57.939 --> 02:03:01.169
than their sex for some things. Um But I

1871
02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:02.589
just don't think we're there yet. I think that,

1872
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.020
you know, we're just starting to really look at

1873
02:03:05.029 --> 02:03:08.169
that. Yy, you know, it's actually very recent and,

1874
02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.370
and it's still not done all the time that

1875
02:03:10.379 --> 02:03:12.529
we even look at a lot of data by

1876
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:17.649
sex right across the biological sciences very often. We

1877
02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:21.560
still don't even differentiate by sex. Um So we're

1878
02:03:21.569 --> 02:03:23.770
only catching up to that to be like, well,

1879
02:03:23.779 --> 02:03:26.089
maybe sex matters and now I think what we

1880
02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:28.990
need to do is add in on top of

1881
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.069
it like I don't think we should get rid

1882
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.870
of sex, but I think we should be asking

1883
02:03:31.879 --> 02:03:34.500
about sex and gender and I think we're gonna

1884
02:03:34.509 --> 02:03:36.649
find that there are some things that sex matters

1885
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:39.180
for and some things that gender matters for.

1886
02:03:40.009 --> 02:03:42.250
Oh, ok. So look, I don't want to torture

1887
02:03:42.259 --> 02:03:44.950
you more because I know it's almost three

1888
02:03:44.959 --> 02:03:45.080
A

1889
02:03:45.089 --> 02:03:45.839
ma

1890
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.479
a

1891
02:03:46.959 --> 02:03:50.430
and we really have to wrap this up and

1892
02:03:50.439 --> 02:03:53.870
uh, I, I mean, we have to schedule another

1893
02:03:53.879 --> 02:03:58.134
conversation just about sex and gender because if we

1894
02:03:58.145 --> 02:04:00.774
kept going on, we would be here for another

1895
02:04:00.785 --> 02:04:02.004
two hours.

1896
02:04:02.015 --> 02:04:04.754
I know. I know it's a great topic though.

1897
02:04:05.035 --> 02:04:08.194
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh So would you like to

1898
02:04:08.205 --> 02:04:10.634
tell people where they can find you and your

1899
02:04:10.645 --> 02:04:11.995
work on the internet.

1900
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.830
Uh Yes, the easiest way is to just type

1901
02:04:16.839 --> 02:04:20.720
pills worth into Google. Um, I am blessed with

1902
02:04:20.729 --> 02:04:25.029
a very rare last name. It's true. I, I

1903
02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.689
mean, I don't know, you should try it there

1904
02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:29.069
in Portugal, but usually if you, somebody just types

1905
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:31.770
pills worth into Google, I'm the first one that

1906
02:04:31.779 --> 02:04:34.299
comes up. Um, AND I'm related to all the

1907
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:36.339
other ones. Uh, BUT I am at Cal State

1908
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:40.540
Fullerton. It's true where there are very, very few

1909
02:04:40.549 --> 02:04:44.279
of us. Um uh AT Cal State Fullerton, I

1910
02:04:44.290 --> 02:04:47.750
do have a, a very out of date web

1911
02:04:47.759 --> 02:04:52.229
address there. Um Which let me give it to

1912
02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:55.790
you. Hold on, I have to look it up.

1913
02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:56.040
I

1914
02:04:56.189 --> 02:04:58.270
mean, I can look it up myself and put

1915
02:04:58.279 --> 02:04:58.709
it in the

1916
02:04:58.959 --> 02:05:02.669
right. So you find me there. Um And uh

1917
02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.240
yeah, and that's it, I guess is as you

1918
02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:07.689
can find me at Cal State Fullerton and on,

1919
02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:08.790
on Google.

1920
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:11.890
