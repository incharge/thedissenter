00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.739
Decent. I'm your host, Ricard Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.399
joined by Doctor Steven Grossberg. He is Wang, professor

4
00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.220
of Cognitive and neuro Systems, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics

5
00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.799
and Statistics, psychological and brain sciences and biomedical engineering

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.760
at Boston University. And today we're focusing on one

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.229
of his books, the latest one. And I guess

8
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.510
that Steve would agree with me when I say

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.830
that it's probably his magnum opus conscious mind, resonant

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.810
brain. How each brain makes a mind. So, Steve,

11
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:40.150
welcome to the show. It's an honor to everyone.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.659
Well, it's a delight to be here and it's

13
00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.970
one of the wonders of modern zoom that you're

14
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.490
in Portugal and I'm in Newton Massachusetts. So there

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.250
we go.

16
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:57.130
Yeah. There we go. It's modern technology, right?

17
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.250
Yeah. Which got really amplified greatly when COVID happened.

18
00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.129
That's when zoom really took off.

19
00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.489
Yeah, that, that's totally right. So to get into

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.300
the topics here, then I, in the first few

21
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:22.419
sections of your book, you get into how we

22
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.699
tackle basically the brain, how we understand the brain,

23
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.739
the mind and the relationship between them and how

24
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.699
you can do it through several different perspectives, mostly

25
00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.169
you focus on physics and psychology. So to introduce

26
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.410
the topic, could you tell us perhaps and also

27
00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:44.250
to add some historical background here for the audience?

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.779
Could you tell us how uh physics and psychology

29
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.330
approach approach this issue? And historically, when and how

30
00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:56.839
did they split in their approaches?

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.870
Yeah. Well, at the um in the late 18

32
00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:08.490
hundreds, uh three very great physicists Helmholtz, I'm sorry,

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.429
Hermann, Von Helmholtz in Germany, Clerk Maxwell in England

34
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.270
and Ernst Mach in Austria made seminal contributions to

35
00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:26.240
psychology and neuroscience. Uh At that time, if you

36
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.759
were interested in the structure of physical space and

37
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.570
time, you would just as likely try to study

38
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.990
psychological space and time. But um so they were

39
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.610
uh interested in understanding how the observed world which

40
00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:50.050
is physics developed side by side their analysis of

41
00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:55.820
the observer, which is us. But by the time

42
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.539
we got to the young Albert Einstein, oh, he

43
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.740
didn't do psychology anymore. He just did physics. And

44
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.009
I wanna quote just a little thing that he

45
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.619
wrote to his friend, Queen Elizabeth of Belgium in

46
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.990
1933 which was much later. But this was his

47
00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.300
stance throughout life that quote, most of us prefer

48
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.649
to look outside rather than inside ourselves. For in

49
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.619
the latter case we see but a dark hole

50
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.419
which means nothing at all. So in the late

51
00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:36.139
18 hundreds of the greatest physicists did psychology and

52
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.660
physics and some neuroscience. And then Einstein who's at

53
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.309
least is great and did only physics. And the

54
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.820
question is why. And one main reason is due

55
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.789
to the properties of the experimental data that Helmholtz

56
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.919
Maxwell and Mach uh discovered. And that data has

57
00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:03.830
characteristics that I like saying a nonlinear non stationary

58
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:09.619
and non local. Whereas traditional physics use models that

59
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.550
are linear stationary and local. So what do those

60
00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:17.970
words mean? Well, nonlinear means uh in the simplest

61
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.980
form, the whole isn't the sum of its parts.

62
00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.898
You know, you chop us up into parts and

63
00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:30.088
life is no longer supported. But nonlinearity more technically

64
00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:34.278
means that you multiply variables. You don't just add

65
00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.329
them linear means you just add stuff non stationary

66
00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:44.140
means we're always evolving from being babies. We develop

67
00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.140
quickly and then we go on through lifelong learning

68
00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:52.760
and non local in the sense that I'm using

69
00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:57.209
it means that there are long range interactions between

70
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.500
many, many neurons in our brains. And that is

71
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.380
because these interactions enable our brains to understand the

72
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.619
context and the objects in which we experience the

73
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.390
world is not just pixel by pixel in a

74
00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.220
painting that our brains look at the whole pattern

75
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.799
which requires interactions. Uh And uh the physicists just

76
00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.239
didn't have the concepts or the math to do

77
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.200
it. And in fact, Helmholz, who started out deeply

78
00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.809
interested in psychology and physiology ended his life only

79
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.369
doing physics. So maybe that's enough to get started.

80
00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.730
And of course, when I asked you here about

81
00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:48.779
how people from physics and psychology, for example, think

82
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.250
about or understand the brain, the mind and the

83
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.089
relationship. I was also at least to some extent

84
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.709
alluding to the mind body problem. So, could you

85
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.809
tell us what exactly is the mind body problem

86
00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.640
and why has it been so difficult to tackle?

87
00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.670
Ok. Well, when we think of our brain, which

88
00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:16.040
is a central feature in our body and the

89
00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:20.160
one that's relevant to our discussion today, we may

90
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.709
think of the little gray cells of Hercule Poirot.

91
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.839
I don't know if you like mysteries, but I

92
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.250
always loved thinking about the little gray cells, but

93
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.529
we think of our mind, we may think about

94
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.140
a beautiful sunset, a feeling of being in love,

95
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:44.470
uh you know, deep thoughts or poetry. And there's

96
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.200
a huge gap between those two. And the question

97
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.010
is, how do you bridge the gap? And that's

98
00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:55.170
what my magnum opus uh tries to do as

99
00:06:55.179 --> 00:07:01.200
reflected by its title Conscious Mind Resonant Brain. How

100
00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:04.290
each brain makes a mind? How do we bridge

101
00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:08.910
the gap? And my book therefore, tries to have

102
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.470
a comprehensive and unified description of the main processes

103
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.890
whereby our brains make our minds. And that can

104
00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:23.369
be done because there are vast databases that were

105
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:30.160
accumulated in psychology and neuroscience uh since the time

106
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.940
of Helm Helmholtz Maxwell and Max. So the problem

107
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.420
wasn't um what am I supposed to explain the

108
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:41.769
problem was how can I find any explanation of

109
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.750
hundreds of experiments and which experiments cohere together? So

110
00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:49.839
in order to even even begin this, you have

111
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:55.709
to have an intuition in which data uh are

112
00:07:55.859 --> 00:08:00.230
probing the same underlying processes. And what are those

113
00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:05.010
processes? So? Well, we start with perception and at

114
00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:09.450
least two main ones, visual and auditory. I won't

115
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:13.929
even talk about tactile and that goes on to

116
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.630
cognition and emotion and action. And we can't just

117
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.109
be satisfied with discussing how that goes on in

118
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.109
uh healthy or typical individuals. It's important to also

119
00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:33.159
understand well, what happens when they break down which

120
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:38.229
they do and can lead to many clinical disorders.

121
00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:40.830
And in the course of my work, I noticed

122
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.549
that if there's certain imbalances or breakdowns in the

123
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.729
neural network processes that I used to model lots

124
00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:55.950
of uh data about typical individuals in a principled

125
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.969
and unifying way. Then al popped uh symptoms of

126
00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:08.299
diseases as varied as Alzheimer's disease, autism, medial temporal

127
00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:14.969
amnesia, schizophrenia, A DH D PTSD, auditory and visual

128
00:09:14.979 --> 00:09:19.260
neglect and agnosia. Even what goes wrong with slow

129
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.630
wave sleep things which I never dreamed of. And

130
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.559
so one of the main things to think about

131
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.270
is, you know, how are you forced into thinking

132
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.640
about things you never dreamed you would know anything

133
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:38.599
about. And more than that um our brains operate

134
00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:44.059
in cycles as a perception, cognition, emotion action cycle

135
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.580
where we're continually interacting with and adapting to a

136
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.369
rapidly changing environment. So with this background, let's come

137
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.840
down back to the mind body problem. Why are

138
00:09:56.849 --> 00:10:03.380
they so intimately linked? And one theme in my

139
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.270
book and, and think about mind body problem is

140
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:15.679
brain evolution needs to achieve behavioral success. So the

141
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.229
uh the meat, the little gray cells, uh the

142
00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:24.440
body part of it is intimately linked through Darwinian

143
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.929
selection to uh the mind part of it. Uh

144
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.239
They, they can't be separated. Um So the book

145
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:42.190
explains how multiple brain circuits and multiple brain regions

146
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.320
interact to generate the behaviors that control our day

147
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:53.460
to day uh activities and mind is what you

148
00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:57.640
can most efficiently call an emergent property, an interactive

149
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.500
property of these brain mechanisms. And even Von Neumann

150
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.750
knew that that the intelligence isn't just in the

151
00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:12.020
local interaction, it's how many of them interact. So

152
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.109
why my book is unusual is that most books

153
00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:19.859
are about mind or brain, but not about each

154
00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:22.599
brain makes a mind. And in this regard, I

155
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:26.380
was lucky because I started my life's work when

156
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.500
I was 17 years old, I was a freshman

157
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:34.659
taking introductory psychology. And there was a lot of

158
00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:40.320
quantitative data about how we learn a classical data,

159
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.599
Hovland Hall. Many other Great American psychologists were into

160
00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:52.619
learning. And so my brain exploded and I was

161
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:59.780
driven into what became neural networks uh including the

162
00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:03.419
main laws of short term memory, medium term memory,

163
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:07.440
long term memory that people use today to explain

164
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.750
how brains make minds. So because I started in

165
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.659
psychology and was forced into brain, I was able

166
00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:18.460
to make the link and then build and build

167
00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:23.700
and build with many gifted collaborators for 67 years.

168
00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:27.700
So it was a lucky start. But why my

169
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:34.849
brain exploded, I can't explain. And um so um

170
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.840
and these are not traditional concepts from computer science,

171
00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:45.770
engineering or traditional symbolic A I, although now a

172
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.929
lot of people call me the father of A

173
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.429
I. Because over the years when symbolic A I

174
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.919
failed, the people in IA I wanted to take

175
00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:59.739
over neural networks to be A I. Marvin Minsky

176
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.789
was one of them. And um anyway, so I'm

177
00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:07.690
called the father of A I because I introduced

178
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:16.289
the modern paradigm in 1957. Um And along the

179
00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:19.369
way, you know, with all the discoveries that just

180
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:24.409
poured out uh over these years, uh it's not

181
00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:28.929
just classical stuff because I had to introduce new

182
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.849
computational paradigms to link brain to mind. And I

183
00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:40.760
call two of them complementary computing and laminar computing

184
00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:49.760
and complementary computing explains the nature of brain specialization.

185
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.830
You know, we don't have independent modules like you

186
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.469
don't first compute uh edges and then shading and

187
00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:03.099
then texture and then depth rather. When we look

188
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.710
at an object, all of these properties can be

189
00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:11.340
overlaid, we're looking at a texture depth, full object

190
00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:15.179
with contours boundaries. And so there's a lot of

191
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:24.059
multiplexing of um properties. And so um complementary computing

192
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.049
was a discovery I gradually made. I didn't wake

193
00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.960
up one day and say, oh let's let's assume

194
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:33.979
the brain as complementary computing. Now I over decades,

195
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:36.900
I we try to explain more and more data

196
00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:40.390
and in every one of them, there were complementary

197
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.900
pairs of processes and a kind of Yin Yang

198
00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:51.340
relationship computationally complementary until I realized it was a

199
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:56.020
global design principle for the brain. Like I think

200
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.260
we might come to it in a while that

201
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:04.719
visual boundaries and surfaces obey computationally complementary laws. The

202
00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:11.630
ventral watt stream that um does perception and recognition

203
00:15:12.229 --> 00:15:15.739
in our brain and the dorsal we stream that

204
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:22.309
the facial representation and action obey computational complementary laws.

205
00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.630
And one of them the what and where is

206
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.630
on a huge scale of atomical organization and the

207
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.659
boundaries and surfaces are much smaller. So you have

208
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:41.150
a multilevel um uh representation of complimentary complementarity in

209
00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:44.590
all brain processes. And I mentioned lam in a

210
00:15:44.599 --> 00:15:52.789
computer and laminar computing explains how all uh higher

211
00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:59.150
forms of biological intelligence are um explained by variations

212
00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:02.020
of a single canonical Lain a circuit. I mean

213
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.619
some listeners may know that if you look at

214
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:14.130
uh the Neocortex that supports vision, speech language cognition,

215
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.559
there are six characteristic layers and characteristic sub lamina

216
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:26.299
with characteristic feedback interactions and horizontal interactions. So bottom

217
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:30.530
up, top down horizontal in all of these circuits.

218
00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:34.750
And one of the marvels of evolution is that

219
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:41.070
specializations of the same canonical circuit can do vision,

220
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.070
speech language and cognition. And that's very important when

221
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.030
you think, how do we develop a sense of

222
00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:52.750
self cause our whole cortex shares a design and

223
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.169
all the parts can seamlessly fit together into an

224
00:16:58.179 --> 00:17:05.410
emergent uh architecture that can be resonating uh as

225
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.010
needed to do, you know everything that we do

226
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.579
in our conscious experience. So I've always felt it

227
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:20.670
was remarkable that some such seemingly different behavioral competences

228
00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.930
emerge out of variations of this ship canonical circuit.

229
00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:32.229
And no less remarkable is that circuit supports different

230
00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:36.920
kinds of conscious awareness. And because all those circuits

231
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.760
obey a similar kind of input output scheme, so

232
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.560
they can all be interacted, feed forward feedback, et

233
00:17:44.569 --> 00:17:51.770
cetera that supports consciousness. Um But maybe that's all

234
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.920
I should say about that you have a lot

235
00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.349
of questions you want me to answer.

236
00:17:57.689 --> 00:18:00.140
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot there to

237
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.750
unpack and it relates to also to some of

238
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.750
the questions that I have

239
00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:09.959
also say for listeners, I think, you know, think

240
00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:13.959
of this interview as listening to his story, everything

241
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:16.589
in the story can be thought about and studied

242
00:18:16.599 --> 00:18:19.510
on multiple levels. But first get the gist of

243
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.989
the story and, and maybe as we go along,

244
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.260
uh you'll ask me to flesh out things more

245
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.989
but, but your questions really asked me to flesh

246
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.270
things out more. So I, I think we should

247
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.469
follow the questions and then see what made the

248
00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:38.589
needs to be added. Of

249
00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:43.079
course. And so uh you've mentioned words like and

250
00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:46.800
computation there. And I would like to perhaps clarify

251
00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.959
that a little bit more. So, are our brains

252
00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:54.670
like computers? I mean, when people talk about com

253
00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:59.060
brains as computers, when they use that metaphor, is

254
00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:00.839
it accurate or not?

255
00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:06.420
Well emphatically not. Um If I start, I just

256
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:12.199
noted we need new computational paradigms. Uh LIKE complementary

257
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:19.619
computing, laminate computing. Uh Moreover, traditional computers aren't conscious.

258
00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:25.380
Um So my work provides or off as a

259
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.550
scientific solution, the mind body problem by showing how

260
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.729
where in our brains and even why from a

261
00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:41.280
deep computational perspective, humans can consciously see here, feel

262
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.589
and know things about the world. And we don't

263
00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:49.910
just get conscious to serenely contemplate the beauty of

264
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.390
the world rather we use our conscious states for

265
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.170
reasons I hope will clarify as we go along

266
00:19:57.449 --> 00:20:05.630
because they are competent to uh um control uh

267
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.209
effective planning and action to realize valued goals. And

268
00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:14.800
so consciousness mediates between mind and the world of

269
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:20.329
action. Um And so to do this, our brains

270
00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:26.170
are self organizing, meaning we can learn by ourselves

271
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:31.510
autonomously throughout life. Their analog, which means that the

272
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.170
neurons can have values going from minimum to max

273
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.939
and everything in between, not namely shades of gray,

274
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.420
much as you might see an achromatic image in

275
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.880
shades of gray and everything operates in parallel because

276
00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:54.689
everything about our intelligence is organized in terms of

277
00:20:54.699 --> 00:21:01.550
spatially distributed patterns of activation. So self-organizing analog parallel,

278
00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:06.439
but present day computers are not self-organizing and they're

279
00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:12.290
digital and serial. So the architectures are fundamentally different.

280
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:19.380
Um My own belief is that as uh computers

281
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.280
evolve and they are, you know, they get even

282
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.170
more powerful, like, you know, my iphone is a

283
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.170
supercomputer. Um We have systems that on the one

284
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:37.569
hand, uh maybe dedicated VL SI chips that embody

285
00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:40.250
more and more of the kind of intelligence that

286
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.770
humans embody are complemented by a lot of things

287
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.150
humans don't do well, which digital computers do like

288
00:21:49.369 --> 00:21:52.550
adding a million numbers in a fraction of a

289
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.300
second. And that will be a very powerful tool

290
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.540
when when and if it happens.

291
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:06.150
And uh you've already mentioned their uh conscious awareness.

292
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.890
How do we experience conscious moments of seeing, hearing,

293
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.839
feeling, knowing and why do things like perception and

294
00:22:17.849 --> 00:22:19.989
awareness uh matter here?

295
00:22:21.729 --> 00:22:28.069
Well, I wanna emphasize that although I've led the

296
00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:32.219
development of what I think is arguably the most

297
00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:36.430
advanced neural theory of consciousness in the sense that

298
00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:40.180
it provides principal and unifying explanations of the most

299
00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:47.380
psychological and or biological data about conscious experiences. I

300
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:52.479
never tried to directly understand consciousness. Uh You don't

301
00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:54.380
wake up in the morning and say, hey, you

302
00:22:54.390 --> 00:23:00.000
know, let's understand consciousness today. Uh But instead all

303
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.319
the deepest insights about how our brains work a

304
00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:07.930
concern. One of the things I just mentioned how

305
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:14.599
they self organize uh through childhood development. And do

306
00:23:14.609 --> 00:23:15.790
you have any kids?

307
00:23:16.209 --> 00:23:17.640
Uh No, not yet. At

308
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.469
least. Well, we have one daughter. Well, anyone who

309
00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:25.750
has observed little kids learn language that's fast self

310
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.209
organization and lifelong learning. We continue learning throughout life.

311
00:23:32.339 --> 00:23:37.530
Remarkably. Uh My models of learning led me forced

312
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:45.260
me kicking and screaming into insights about consciousness. And

313
00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:49.839
uh so my work on learning led to the

314
00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:55.150
most advanced, currently, the most advanced cognitive and neural

315
00:23:55.170 --> 00:24:00.550
the about how brains learn to pay attention, recognize

316
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.949
and predict objects and events in a changing world

317
00:24:05.339 --> 00:24:09.790
emphatically. One that's filled with unexpected events because that's

318
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.250
what we got to do to deal with evolutionary

319
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.910
challenges. And this is the theory I call adaptive

320
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.010
resonance theory for a reason. I'll make clear in

321
00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.979
a moment and all of the foundational hypotheses have

322
00:24:24.989 --> 00:24:28.099
uh from which I could derive art have been

323
00:24:28.109 --> 00:24:35.400
supported by subsequent psychological and neurobiological data. And art

324
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.680
has also provided principled and unifying explanations of many

325
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:46.790
additional experiments. But for me, the bottom line is

326
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.050
really that I was able to derive art. I

327
00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.689
say art A RT instead of adaptive Resonance theory

328
00:24:56.219 --> 00:25:00.650
in 1980 in an off cited article in the

329
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.640
journal Psychological Ro review from a thought experiment. And

330
00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:11.229
this thought experiment is about how any learning system

331
00:25:12.109 --> 00:25:17.099
can autonomously learn to correct predictive errors. So this

332
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:23.020
is all about autonomous learning and the hypotheses of

333
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.849
the thought experiment are just a few facts that

334
00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:29.660
are familiar to us all. And they're familiar because

335
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:34.790
they represent ubiquitous environmental pressures on the evolution of

336
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.020
our brain. So they're not something. Oh, well, why

337
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.969
should I believe that? You believe it because you've

338
00:25:39.979 --> 00:25:43.130
been living with it your whole life. And moreover,

339
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.290
during the thought experiment, I never used the word

340
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:51.489
mind or brain. Mhm. So, the thought experiment and

341
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.719
the principles and mechanisms that come out of the

342
00:25:54.729 --> 00:25:58.969
wash are thus the universal solution to the learning

343
00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:06.150
problem. Wherever those hypotheses are used to derive their

344
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.250
logical consequences, you'll get a system like art and

345
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.209
the learning problem, which I didn't say one crucial

346
00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:21.560
fact about lifelong learning implies that when I learn

347
00:26:21.569 --> 00:26:25.760
something, I won't just forget it right away, which

348
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:30.160
is called catastrophic forgetting. For example, Ricardo, I never

349
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.439
uh saw your face before and now I'll remember

350
00:26:34.449 --> 00:26:36.699
it for the rest of my life. So I

351
00:26:36.709 --> 00:26:39.500
learn it in a second. I'll remember it for

352
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:45.069
years. So I call this the stability plasticity dilemma.

353
00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:51.689
How any system can learn without catastrophe, forgetting plasticity

354
00:26:51.699 --> 00:26:55.839
of because we experience incredibly fast learning often and

355
00:26:55.849 --> 00:26:59.050
then stability. The fact that our memory of that

356
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.709
fast learning can persist for a very long time.

357
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.880
And let me just say, for those of you

358
00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.949
who know some popular current A I like deep

359
00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:15.609
learning or it experiences catastrophic forgetting big time in

360
00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:19.550
multiple ways. Uh If we maybe we will talk

361
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.160
about a little later. So I think therefore, it's

362
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:28.989
remarkable. But that these results about learning without catastrophic

363
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.810
forgetting is what led me to rigorous neural models

364
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:37.030
of how we consciously see, hear and feel and

365
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.739
know things about the world. So I derive the

366
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:47.199
models I was explaining with simulation, parametric quantitative computer

367
00:27:47.209 --> 00:27:52.739
simulations with my many students and postdoc all this

368
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:58.619
quantitative data about seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing. And

369
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.069
then I realized all those parametric properties or properties

370
00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:08.060
of conscious experiences. So consciousness sort of came in

371
00:28:08.069 --> 00:28:12.439
through the back door. Uh And the thing that

372
00:28:12.449 --> 00:28:18.469
all of these experiences had in common are resonances

373
00:28:19.939 --> 00:28:23.890
which occur when there's excitatory feedback bottom up, top

374
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:30.199
down excitatory feedback between pairs or greater numbers of

375
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:35.239
brain regions when they match their signals well enough

376
00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:40.939
to cause the active cells to synchronize boom, boom,

377
00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:44.969
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Um And that's

378
00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:48.329
one reason why we have brain rhythms, but different

379
00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:55.739
brain rhythms support different processes and sustain. They're firing

380
00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:02.189
long enough to trigger not only learning but consciousness.

381
00:29:02.199 --> 00:29:04.900
In other words, the resonances and the requirement for

382
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:11.439
matching or what dynamically buffer a learning process against

383
00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:18.219
catastrophic forgetting. And the remarkable thing is that the

384
00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:24.000
contents of these resonances match properties of the conscious

385
00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:29.040
experiences that they're learning to represent. That's why I

386
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.170
call my theory adaptive resonance theory because of how

387
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:40.339
resonances trigger learning that doesn't experience catastrophic forgetting. So

388
00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:44.689
the proposed solution on mind body problem occurs due

389
00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:48.750
to a computational analysis of how humans and other

390
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.510
animals autonomously learn in a changing world without catastrophic

391
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.250
forgetting. And because the hypotheses and the thought experiments

392
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.619
that lead to cognitive models like adaptive resonance theory,

393
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.760
as well as cognitive emotional models, like what I

394
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.170
call my cog and model, the cognitive emotional motor

395
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.050
model never mentioned the word mind and brain. Um

396
00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:18.839
My work and my book show how these models

397
00:30:18.849 --> 00:30:26.239
provide a blueprint for designing autonomous adaptive intelligent applications

398
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.650
to engineering technology and A I. So if you

399
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:37.390
want autonomous adaptive intelligence, we already have the foundations

400
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.380
of a blueprint for it for the future. Um

401
00:30:43.479 --> 00:30:46.219
In particular, my books spend a lot of time

402
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.250
uh explaining how our brains consciously see the world.

403
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.540
And that's not surprising because more than half of

404
00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:01.150
various mammalian brains are devoted to vision from excuse

405
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.939
me, early sensory processing up to visually based cognitive

406
00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:11.500
planning and navigation. Um In other words, we need

407
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:16.079
perception and consciousness to be able to act upon

408
00:31:16.089 --> 00:31:21.079
the world by looking, reaching and navigating uh in

409
00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:26.079
order to survive environmental challenges. So this link between

410
00:31:26.089 --> 00:31:30.439
consciousness and action I think is very interesting mediated

411
00:31:30.449 --> 00:31:37.089
by learning that solves the stability plasticity dilemma. Sorry

412
00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:40.040
about this. I have had asthma for over 70

413
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.390
years.

414
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.469
Uh So uh another thing that I would like

415
00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:46.540
to ask you about and it's something that you

416
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:51.089
also tackle in the book is Visual Illusion. So

417
00:31:51.099 --> 00:31:54.449
how do they work and what can we learn

418
00:31:54.459 --> 00:31:57.750
about? I guess not only the visual system but

419
00:31:57.819 --> 00:32:02.650
information processing by understanding how visual illusions work.

420
00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:05.609
Yeah, I wish we were able to figure out

421
00:32:05.819 --> 00:32:09.969
how to show my powerpoint slides. I'll try to

422
00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:13.689
use the words uh about what the pictures would

423
00:32:13.699 --> 00:32:16.900
have shown more clearly. So first let me sketch

424
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:22.010
why we experience visual illusions, which will also start

425
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:28.099
to explain how they work. Um So let's start

426
00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:32.810
with the retina, the photosensitive retina, that's where light

427
00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:37.430
is registered before light signals all over the retina

428
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:43.670
are bundled through axons as the pathways uh into

429
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.369
the optic nerve to set pattern light from the

430
00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:57.469
whole retina up to the brain because of the

431
00:32:57.479 --> 00:33:01.369
need to form the optic nerve to carry the

432
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.880
light signals to the brain. The retina has no

433
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:11.199
photo detectors on the part of the retina where

434
00:33:11.209 --> 00:33:15.300
the optic nerve forms, that part of the retina

435
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:22.369
is blind. And um you might say, well, big

436
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.609
deal, I don't see it, it hasn't caused any

437
00:33:26.619 --> 00:33:31.880
trouble. But if you look down on the retina

438
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.650
and I had a pretty picture to show you

439
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.770
that. And if you get my book, um it

440
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.640
has all these pictures, it has over 600 color

441
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:47.800
pictures. So everything I say is illustrated, another part

442
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.030
of the retina not far from the blind spot

443
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.170
is called the fovea Fove A. That's where all

444
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.790
of our high acuity vision occurs. And it's because

445
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.890
we need the phia to really see things clearly

446
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:09.379
that we move our eyes several times every second

447
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.489
with psychotic eye movements to point them to the

448
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.438
things we really wanna see clearly. Things in the

449
00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:20.899
periphery get fuzzier and fuzzier and the blind spot

450
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:25.270
is as big as the phobia. And now you

451
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.478
might say, but then why don't I see it?

452
00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:33.409
And um, before getting into, why think about it,

453
00:34:33.418 --> 00:34:36.530
we couldn't look at or reach for an object

454
00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:41.309
that happened to re registered where the blind spot

455
00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:45.467
is. If we didn't somehow do something to make

456
00:34:45.478 --> 00:34:49.540
that problem go away and that could lead to

457
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.418
disaster, you know, a leopard is leaping at you

458
00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:56.340
in the place where the blind spot would have

459
00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:01.449
seen it tough. So why aren't we aware of

460
00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:04.090
the missing visual signals due to the blind spot

461
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:11.879
in particular, how do you complete the retina representation

462
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.290
so that we can look at and reach for

463
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:23.350
things which otherwise might have been uh invisible. And

464
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.179
one thing you have to deal with right away

465
00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:31.129
is our eyes are rapidly jiggling in the orbit.

466
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.580
They're sort of micro the cards and they're happening

467
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.679
so fast and they're so small, you don't notice

468
00:35:37.689 --> 00:35:42.159
it, but it's functionally very important because there may

469
00:35:42.169 --> 00:35:46.100
be a stationary object in the world and you

470
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.840
are stationary with respect to it. But your retina

471
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.360
is jiggling back and forth around every edge of

472
00:35:54.370 --> 00:36:01.379
that object and it's creating transient signals. Um And

473
00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:09.149
these transient signals, refresh visual signals um which otherwise

474
00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:13.820
would fade. I like to mention Jurassic Park here.

475
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.449
And did you see Jurassic Park? Yes, I do.

476
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:22.020
You know that famous scene where um this guy

477
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:26.669
is standing out of the car and T Rex

478
00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:32.989
comes looking very ravenous and they scream, stand still.

479
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.889
He can only see relative motion and then T

480
00:36:36.979 --> 00:36:43.000
Rex moves his head. Yes, relative motion and scoops

481
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:47.510
them up in one bite. Anyway, the blind spot

482
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.659
is stabilized on the retina. So it doesn't create

483
00:36:52.669 --> 00:36:59.340
transients and so it fades. So it's not gonna

484
00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:03.340
cause a problem in itself, but you still have

485
00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:07.330
uh an incomplete retina limit with a big hole

486
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.120
in it. And so how do you complete that?

487
00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:17.060
And that is comp accomplished by multiple stages of

488
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:23.149
completing boundaries across the hall and fill in with

489
00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:27.969
surface brightness and color. And it takes several stages

490
00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:35.110
to do it. Um And I call processes whereby

491
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:41.719
incomplete representations are completed by multiple stages of processing

492
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.540
a hierarchical resolution of uncertainty because when you're done,

493
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:52.310
you're going to get completed boundaries and completed surface

494
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.669
representations. So you don't know there was a hole

495
00:37:55.679 --> 00:38:00.530
there. Mhm But then that raises a deep question.

496
00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:07.199
How does the brain know at what stage the

497
00:38:07.209 --> 00:38:12.719
cortical representation say of a surface representing your face

498
00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:20.669
is complete enough uh to um control looking at

499
00:38:20.679 --> 00:38:24.050
you or maybe touching your nose? How do you

500
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.860
know what stage? Because it took a lot of

501
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:31.100
stages. And you don't want to use a stage

502
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.340
that has an incomplete representation because then the leopard

503
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:39.120
could leap at you through your blind spot. And

504
00:38:39.129 --> 00:38:43.100
the answer that I propose is that a resonance

505
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:49.429
with a completed surface representation. And the next processing

506
00:38:49.439 --> 00:38:52.919
stage. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa surface

507
00:38:52.929 --> 00:39:00.020
representation. Next stage lights up the surface representation makes

508
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.699
it consciously visible. And then we use the conscious

509
00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:12.229
representation to look and reach. And so the hierarchical

510
00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:18.290
resolution of uncertainty created the need to have some

511
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.360
active process light up the completed representation. And I

512
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:31.330
call this a surface shroud resonance because spatial attention

513
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:37.280
focusing on the surface is called a intentional shroud.

514
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:41.459
And I predict it occurs between a pre stride

515
00:39:41.469 --> 00:39:44.820
visual cortex V four. In other words, there's a

516
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.580
hierarchy of cortical stages. It took several days stages

517
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:54.870
to complete the surface and the posterior parietal cortex

518
00:39:55.189 --> 00:39:59.909
which is known to support spatial attention. So V

519
00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:03.790
four P PC I predict supports the surface route

520
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.300
resonance and there's a lot of data supporting that.

521
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.219
So getting back to the original question, what's a

522
00:40:12.229 --> 00:40:18.060
visual illusion? If the boundaries that are completed do

523
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:25.360
not contain expected surface brightness and colors, then we

524
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.110
say we're looking at a visual illusion. The truth

525
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.500
is that almost everything we see is a visual

526
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.709
illusion in the sense that we're completing boundaries and

527
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:40.310
surfaces not only over the blind spot also over

528
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.560
the plexus of retinal veins that covers the photo

529
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:50.429
detectors. In addition, where compensating for variable illumination, we

530
00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:57.719
not seeing the illumination gradient. So the final representation

531
00:40:57.729 --> 00:41:01.909
of objects and scenes are visual illusions, but we

532
00:41:01.919 --> 00:41:05.580
only say, oh that's a visual illusion. If the

533
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.310
color isn't what it we think it should be

534
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.110
based on our experience with that kind of boundary.

535
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:17.550
So everything basically in vision is an illusion and

536
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.790
the ones that look funny, we call illusions.

537
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.959
OK? But about those ones that look funny and

538
00:41:25.969 --> 00:41:32.159
we call illusions. How does understanding how we experience

539
00:41:32.169 --> 00:41:36.360
those connect to our experience of art?

540
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.270
Well, here, I would have shown you several pictures

541
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.550
that would have been uh let people listening. We

542
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.169
weren't able to figure out how to link my

543
00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:51.610
powerpoint to the zoom. I've done it in the

544
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.330
past, but I think the software changed or something.

545
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.030
I don't know. First, I want to say a

546
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.810
little bit more about boundaries and surfaces because they

547
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:07.850
are the general functional units of how we see.

548
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.050
That's an early prediction of mine that various people

549
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:21.590
and supported psychophysics. So, um there's a wonderful uh

550
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.820
illusion that it's painful to me not to be

551
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:27.909
able to show it to you because it's gonna

552
00:42:27.919 --> 00:42:31.149
be so hard to explain is a certain kind

553
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:37.879
of Kinnier Square, Gaetano Kita famously introduced lots of

554
00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:44.610
visual illusions. He's very great uh Italian perceptual psychologist

555
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.899
who died some years ago in this illusion. He

556
00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:58.020
takes um circles and he'll make part of the

557
00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:04.120
circle black and part of it light blue in

558
00:43:04.129 --> 00:43:08.649
a lot of concentric circles so that the black

559
00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:14.080
blue interface is horizontal. But I'll make a Pacman

560
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.270
out of it where the black part has a

561
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.449
Pacman shape. These are all black lines and then

562
00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:24.570
there's a little quarter of it, which is the

563
00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:29.909
blue parts which have less contrast and he'll do

564
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:36.540
four of them, 12 parallel to each other, like

565
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:42.139
oriented three. It is hard to do, but it's

566
00:43:42.149 --> 00:43:47.429
backwards. So we'll have pairs in a row and

567
00:43:47.439 --> 00:43:51.070
then pairs one on top of the other. And

568
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.449
so if you look at where the black and

569
00:43:54.459 --> 00:44:01.870
blue uh interfaces occur, they all line up to

570
00:44:01.879 --> 00:44:06.409
form an illusory square and my book has it.

571
00:44:06.419 --> 00:44:07.879
I don't know if you can see it.

572
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.929
Yes. Yes, I can. Yes.

573
00:44:10.719 --> 00:44:18.800
So you see the point is that because of

574
00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:25.669
the bound, the strong black boundaries inhibiting the weak

575
00:44:25.879 --> 00:44:30.800
blue boundaries, that's enough to make the square form.

576
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:36.350
And it's also enough to let surface color pour

577
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.750
out of the broken blue boundary to fill in

578
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.020
the entire square. So what you see is a

579
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:47.929
blue square, neither the blue nor the square are

580
00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:51.909
in the image. But what this illustrates and that's

581
00:44:51.919 --> 00:44:56.800
why it's such a lovely example. Boundaries are completed

582
00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:02.290
inwardly between pairs or greater numbers of inducers in

583
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.310
an oriented way. That's how you complete the square

584
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.959
and the blue color that spills out of the

585
00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:20.530
little blue uh broken boundaries spreads in a uh

586
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:28.969
un oriented way um to fill in the square.

587
00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:36.300
So um so the color spreads outwardly and un

588
00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:41.590
oriented and the boundaries are completed inwardly and oriented.

589
00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:46.080
And so you could see from this outward, inward

590
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:50.620
oriented, un oriented, a sense of what I mean,

591
00:45:50.629 --> 00:45:54.229
that boundaries and surfaces are complementary and, and Yang,

592
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.050
because you can't be both oriented and un oriented

593
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.000
and you can't be both outward and inward and

594
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.860
without both of them interacting though you don't see

595
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:10.290
anything. And so you have these parallel cortical streams

596
00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:17.239
that are doing complementary computing and then interacting to

597
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:24.530
overcome their complementary deficiencies. And there's one more big

598
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:29.090
property of boundaries and surfaces. For starters, we can

599
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:35.110
consciously see surface brightness and color we see while

600
00:46:35.169 --> 00:46:42.659
the, but we can't consciously see boundaries except when

601
00:46:42.669 --> 00:46:47.580
they separate surfaces with different brightness and color boundaries

602
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:53.020
are invisible. It's called the offset grading. Uh Yes.

603
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:59.850
OK. So all I've drawn is horizontal black lines,

604
00:47:00.669 --> 00:47:06.840
but usually you can recognize that there's a vertical

605
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.820
boundary of some kind between the ends of those

606
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:18.129
lines. Can you recognize that? So, but the boundary

607
00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:25.820
is invisible? OK. All boundaries are invisible. The only

608
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:31.439
reason why you'll see color is because if you

609
00:47:31.449 --> 00:47:34.189
create uh let me see if you can see

610
00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:35.750
this. Whoops. Uh

611
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.110
uh Yes, I can, I can. This

612
00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.500
is called the Ehrenstein disk. All I drew were

613
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:48.889
black lines. It completed a roughly circular boundary, perpendicular

614
00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:52.179
lines. And then at the line ends, there were

615
00:47:52.189 --> 00:47:58.090
little black white contrasts that were little brightness buttons

616
00:47:58.489 --> 00:48:03.389
that filled in within the boundary, the circular boundary

617
00:48:03.399 --> 00:48:05.139
and makes it look brighter. Do you see? It

618
00:48:05.149 --> 00:48:06.090
looks brighter?

619
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.080
Yes, I see.

620
00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:13.300
OK. So that's a case where because the color

621
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:18.620
can't escape, it makes for a visible brightness difference,

622
00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:22.949
but here the color can escape because it can

623
00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:27.100
flow all out of there and spread uniformly on

624
00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:31.620
both sides of the vertical boundary. And so it's

625
00:48:31.629 --> 00:48:36.370
invisible. So I let me show you, I think

626
00:48:36.379 --> 00:48:40.310
I wanna show you a very famous picture. That's

627
00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:46.229
a lot of fun. Let me see. This is

628
00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:47.860
a famous picture

629
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:49.979
uh perhaps just please move it a little bit

630
00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:53.469
away from the camera because OK, like that like

631
00:48:53.479 --> 00:48:53.770
that,

632
00:48:55.229 --> 00:48:57.409
I don't know if you can see, I can

633
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.969
see first, it looks just like splotches of black

634
00:49:00.979 --> 00:49:04.080
on white. But if you look at it for

635
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.189
a while, you can see a Dalmatian dog in

636
00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:16.340
snow. It's hard to do the image all the

637
00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:21.030
way to my right is the kita square. Mhm

638
00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:24.040
I don't know if you can see. Yes, I

639
00:49:24.139 --> 00:49:27.270
can see and right next to it horizontally, what's

640
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.139
called a reverse contrast kita square? Now the Kinnier

641
00:49:31.439 --> 00:49:37.040
square just like uh when I made that circle

642
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:41.600
with the lines, it looks brighter because the Pac

643
00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:46.929
Man, the four pac men create square boundaries and

644
00:49:46.939 --> 00:49:51.639
then they put bright contrast inside which fill in

645
00:49:51.649 --> 00:49:54.989
the square and look brighter. But if you look

646
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.260
at the one right next to it, it has

647
00:49:59.649 --> 00:50:06.270
two black and two white inducers on gray background.

648
00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.209
And there you can recognize that there is a

649
00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:16.659
square but the gray inside and outside of the

650
00:50:16.669 --> 00:50:23.879
square is the same. So it's visible. So in

651
00:50:23.889 --> 00:50:26.379
the case of the reverse contrast, Ken it a

652
00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:29.560
square, I'm so sorry, I should have just made.

653
00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:31.870
No, no, no worries. I can edit this.

654
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:39.500
Yeah. So you can consciously recognize a a square

655
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:47.719
boundary that you don't see. Um Anyway, many artists

656
00:50:48.169 --> 00:50:55.409
knew uh instinctively about these things, including matisse who

657
00:50:55.419 --> 00:51:02.669
I love and matisse used to like writing that

658
00:51:03.219 --> 00:51:06.340
all bound. Well, he didn't write all boundaries are

659
00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:14.409
invisible, but he painted with color blotches and knowing

660
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.929
that the boundaries would be completed to create a

661
00:51:21.939 --> 00:51:27.409
scene. And one of my favorites is the self

662
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.989
care and

663
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
I leave it, leave it like that, please. Yeah.

664
00:51:30.659 --> 00:51:37.479
Yeah. He painted that in uh 1905. And if

665
00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:40.949
you see it uh in my book or on

666
00:51:40.959 --> 00:51:43.860
the web or wherever you'll see that there are

667
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.479
a lot of color splotches, but they're arranged in

668
00:51:47.489 --> 00:51:52.989
a way that invisible boundaries join them and create

669
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.949
surface representations of objects. So let me see if

670
00:51:58.959 --> 00:52:02.379
I can, they get the schematic of that.

671
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.469
Yes, I can see it now. Yeah,

672
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:10.919
you see the splotches create a modal boundary groupings

673
00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:18.689
which then capture the splotches into surface color. So,

674
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:26.969
OK, anyway, so um that is one link between

675
00:52:27.879 --> 00:52:34.189
art and um illusions. And I discussed the work

676
00:52:34.199 --> 00:52:39.330
of 14 different artists showing how they all instinctively

677
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.409
exploited different properties of how we see. I mean,

678
00:52:43.419 --> 00:52:48.820
just consider like uh the impressionists like Monet and

679
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:54.800
Point Allistic painting sera. Um YOU know how these

680
00:52:54.810 --> 00:53:01.169
little points of color arranged uh in an appropriate

681
00:53:01.179 --> 00:53:06.270
way, generated emergent boundaries and surfaces that you can

682
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:13.080
interpret as a beautiful scene. So uh my book

683
00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.050
spends a lot of time showing how different artists

684
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:25.709
and artistic movements um uh generated uh painterly precepts

685
00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:31.320
that we understand often as scenes and objects even,

686
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.610
you know, and like how you get effects of

687
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.939
three dimensional curvature in a two D painting. And

688
00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:43.070
one of the big things my book explains is

689
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.290
how the way our visual system adapted to the

690
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:55.139
three dimensional world, those same laws automatically enable us

691
00:53:55.149 --> 00:54:05.879
to understand paintings. Um ZOOM screen movies as 3d

692
00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:08.679
objects. You know, I'm not seeing you like a

693
00:54:08.689 --> 00:54:12.409
pancake, I'm seeing a frontal view of a three

694
00:54:12.419 --> 00:54:13.860
dimensional face.

695
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:16.689
And so we've been talking here a lot about

696
00:54:16.699 --> 00:54:19.639
the visual system, but how do we go from

697
00:54:19.649 --> 00:54:25.439
seeing to recognizing and also then to predicting the

698
00:54:25.449 --> 00:54:25.959
world?

699
00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:34.070
Um So first let's distinguish, seeing and recognizing. So

700
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.300
seeing, we open our eyes and if there's enough

701
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:42.149
light we'll see, it could be unfamiliar or familiar.

702
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:47.429
Uh So seeing is a general purpose process, but

703
00:54:47.439 --> 00:54:53.439
we only recognize familiar things. So recognition requires prior

704
00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:59.669
learning of recognition categories for objects and scenes. Uh

705
00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:04.969
SO that these categories would selectively fire after learning

706
00:55:04.979 --> 00:55:08.360
in response to the objects and scenes that we've

707
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.399
experienced before. And that raises the question, how do

708
00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:16.679
you learn a recognition category? And I already noted

709
00:55:16.689 --> 00:55:21.310
that Adaptive Resonance Theory or art explains how we

710
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:27.300
learn to recognize stuff without experiencing catastrophic forgetting. And

711
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:31.179
one thing I didn't say about learning in what

712
00:55:31.189 --> 00:55:36.070
I said, it enables us to pay attention. But

713
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.000
what it's what we're learning as we're learning categories

714
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:45.449
that can be used for prediction is what are

715
00:55:45.459 --> 00:55:52.139
the critical feature combinations that are going to predict

716
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:57.459
uh successful action? How do we suppress the irrelevant

717
00:55:57.469 --> 00:56:02.500
outliers? And when you study adaptive residency, you see

718
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:09.500
how over learning trials outlier, irrelevant features get actively

719
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:13.330
suppressed and you gradually converge it can be very

720
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.870
fast. It depends on the complexity of the problem

721
00:56:19.419 --> 00:56:24.169
on a set of critical features in the activation

722
00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:29.229
pattern. Uh THAT you know, the top down expectation

723
00:56:29.239 --> 00:56:32.820
is lighting up and it's so critical features that

724
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.320
go into the bottom up adaptive filters that choose

725
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:41.489
the category and in the top down expectation that

726
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:47.739
the category reads out to focus attention. And so

727
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:53.389
the critical features enable art categories to be associated

728
00:56:53.399 --> 00:57:02.129
with predictive consequences. Um Yeah. So and so and

729
00:57:02.139 --> 00:57:07.959
different resonances then support seeing and recognizing I mentioned

730
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:15.320
mhm A surface shroud resonance supports conscious seeing and

731
00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.040
uh the shroud is in posterior parietal cortex. Um

732
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:26.649
THE surfaces in V four, when that resonance occurs,

733
00:57:26.979 --> 00:57:31.340
it propagates top down all the way down to

734
00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:34.360
uh lateral chani it all the way up to

735
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.739
prefrontal cortex. And because of what's called the art

736
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.560
matching room, namely how we pay attention. It selects

737
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.300
the critical features that uh we should be looking

738
00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:52.840
at. But then the feature category resonance um which

739
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:58.229
goes into the watch stream, recognition and perception stream

740
00:57:58.449 --> 00:58:04.330
that supports conscious knowing. So that when a surface

741
00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:10.489
shroud resonance and a feature category resonance synchronize, when

742
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.300
I look at a familiar person's face, I both

743
00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:18.850
see them and know who they are. Um And

744
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.489
I had a nice, nice picture of that. But

745
00:58:22.879 --> 00:58:25.949
if, if you're interested anyway about my book, if

746
00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:29.189
you are interested, I I should say this because,

747
00:58:29.199 --> 00:58:31.270
you know, you might think such a big book.

748
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.739
Uh If you buy it on Kindle, it's 15

749
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.320
bucks. And if you buy it from Amazon, it's

750
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:42.280
about 30 it would have cost over 100. But

751
00:58:42.969 --> 00:58:45.280
I worked very hard on the book and I

752
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.560
want the people who are interested to be able

753
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:53.399
to afford it. So I I asked Oxford University

754
00:58:53.409 --> 00:58:55.699
Press how much of my own money I had

755
00:58:55.709 --> 00:58:59.689
to give them to bring the prices down. So

756
00:58:59.699 --> 00:59:02.560
if you get it, it's cheap because I subsidized

757
00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:02.760
it.

758
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.830
Well, thank you so much for that. That's very

759
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.580
generous. I guess that people will

760
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.979
be. How much did it cost in Portugal? Yeah,

761
00:59:11.989 --> 00:59:15.310
I don't know why the, the you, you use

762
00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.899
euros in Portugal.

763
00:59:17.159 --> 00:59:19.860
Uh, Y yes, I, I mean, I, I think

764
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:24.239
it cost around, uh, I don't know, €30 I

765
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:29.260
guess I um order it from Amazon Spain. So,

766
00:59:29.989 --> 00:59:32.949
yeah, so that's not that different from $30.

767
00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:35.580
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's

768
00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:38.919
right. Well, thank you for buying it. So um

769
00:59:38.929 --> 00:59:40.629
should we, should we move on? Uh

770
00:59:40.639 --> 00:59:43.379
Yes. Uh And I was going to ask you

771
00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:49.739
now, uh actually earlier, you've mentioned for example, your

772
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:54.030
uh cognition, emotion motor model. But how do you

773
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.439
look at the relationship between emotion and cognition

774
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.810
and brave cognition about is what we know about

775
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:07.320
the world and emotion embodies, how we feel about

776
01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:11.610
what we know. And it's emotion that gives value

777
01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:18.120
to what we know. And here another resonance occurs

778
01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:27.179
between our cognitive alike representations and our emotional representations.

779
01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.879
So the alike ones are in places like infra

780
01:00:30.939 --> 01:00:34.739
temporal and prefrontal cortex. The emotional ones are in

781
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:41.500
places like the Amygdala and hypothalamus. And when there's

782
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:48.939
a resonance between cognitive and emotional uh representations that

783
01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:52.439
combines what we know with how we feel about

784
01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:58.209
it. And the feedback from the emotional representation is

785
01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:04.590
called incentive motivation. Not only to pay sustained attention

786
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:09.459
to something that we currently value, but it also

787
01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:15.639
gives the motivation to release actions to realize goals

788
01:01:15.649 --> 01:01:19.179
about things we value. So, you know, if I

789
01:01:19.189 --> 01:01:24.879
see my wife's face a little way from here,

790
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.969
I'll feel all the good things I feel to

791
01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:32.939
her and the motivation to approach her. So a

792
01:01:32.949 --> 01:01:40.699
cognitive emotional resonance sends positive feedback between the cognitive

793
01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:46.459
and emotional representations. So just as a current object

794
01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:52.179
or event can trigger an emotion, an active emotion

795
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.860
can select and focus attention on objects and events

796
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.209
that are compatible with that emotion. And that can

797
01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:06.439
help us achieve, you know, um results that are

798
01:02:06.449 --> 01:02:11.820
compatible with it where emotion could be hunger and

799
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:18.159
we just wanna go have lunch. So um how

800
01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:23.500
to notice desire attend and eat that ice cream

801
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:29.010
cone. It's all wrapped up into cognitive emotional resonances

802
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:34.719
in their output pathways. Um So the cognitive emotional

803
01:02:34.729 --> 01:02:39.449
resonance is a different kind of consciousness because it

804
01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:48.419
links, for example, um to surface shroud resonance. Well,

805
01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.010
I think we're gonna talk about that in a

806
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.600
moment.

807
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:55.760
So, so I I mean, these different kinds of

808
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:59.270
awareness that we have and we've talked about some

809
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.739
of them, how, how are they then integrated into

810
01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:08.870
what we experience as unified moments of conscious awareness?

811
01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:15.459
Yeah. So for that multiple adaptive resonance is synchronized.

812
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.709
I mentioned two of them that could. But so

813
01:03:19.719 --> 01:03:24.459
example, during a conversation with a friend, we might

814
01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:29.979
be synchronizing surface shroud residents to consciously see them

815
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:36.449
stream shroud resonances that consciously hear them feature category

816
01:03:36.459 --> 01:03:44.270
resonances to consciously recognize what we're hearing. Cognitive emotional

817
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.370
resonance is to consciously have feelings about what we're

818
01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:53.530
discussing and then what's called item list resonances to

819
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.780
consciously understand the conversation because they're supporting things like

820
01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:05.669
working memory of sequential sounds that form language phrases

821
01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:10.360
and sentences, and all of them come together to

822
01:04:10.699 --> 01:04:15.080
enable us to act appropriately during the conversation. So

823
01:04:15.169 --> 01:04:18.850
it's not just a single resonance, there's a continually

824
01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:23.360
evolving series of resident states as stuff keeps happening.

825
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.689
And so uh we've already talked here about the

826
01:04:27.699 --> 01:04:30.739
relationship between cognition and emotion. Uh I would like

827
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:35.209
to ask you now specifically about the prefrontal cortex.

828
01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:38.070
So, in all of what we've been talking about

829
01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.280
here, does the prefrontal cortex play a special role?

830
01:04:44.149 --> 01:04:48.620
Um Well, I'm gonna want to show you a

831
01:04:48.629 --> 01:04:52.909
figure of that for sure. But, but first, let

832
01:04:52.919 --> 01:04:57.070
me say it carries out or controls many of

833
01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:02.989
the higher cognitive, emotional and decision making processes that

834
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.679
define human intelligence as it's also controlling release of

835
01:05:07.689 --> 01:05:12.310
actions uh and aimed at achieving value gold. And

836
01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.409
as I just mentioned, one of the things prefrontal

837
01:05:15.419 --> 01:05:22.699
cortex has it has um working memories that can

838
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:30.419
uh generate uh what I call um list chunks

839
01:05:30.429 --> 01:05:36.290
or list categories like words, sentences, phrases, thoughts that

840
01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:41.639
can sequentially determine what's appropriate to do in a

841
01:05:41.649 --> 01:05:46.540
given situation. So it's not just one thing and

842
01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:50.540
it enabled us to generate behaviors that are flexible

843
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.129
and adaptive notably in novel situations and to suppress

844
01:05:56.139 --> 01:06:01.419
ones that aren't by using this contextual knowledge. Um

845
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.449
Can you see the seven regions on top in

846
01:06:05.459 --> 01:06:08.219
red and green?

847
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.979
Uh uh Yeah, I, I mean the green, it's

848
01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:14.979
not perceptible here. But yeah, I see the, the

849
01:06:14.989 --> 01:06:15.600
several

850
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.959
regions on top, they're all different regions of prefrontal

851
01:06:21.969 --> 01:06:28.679
cortex. And basically, when you put together all the

852
01:06:28.959 --> 01:06:36.260
models into this larger neural architecture, it explains how

853
01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:44.399
the prefrontal cortex interacts with uh cognitive emotional decision

854
01:06:44.409 --> 01:06:51.590
making processes to make contextually based decisions about what

855
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.770
to do or think next. So it's uh so

856
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.100
you got to understand how working memories work and

857
01:06:59.179 --> 01:07:02.810
a whole series of things we won't discuss much

858
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:03.399
today.

859
01:07:04.679 --> 01:07:08.520
So earlier, you've mentioned learning and I want to

860
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.639
ask you a little bit more about it because

861
01:07:10.649 --> 01:07:14.500
actually in the book, you also explain why we

862
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:18.340
need to understand learning to then properly understand consciousness.

863
01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:22.340
And you distinguish between two different types of learning,

864
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:28.199
perceiving and knowing versus moving and navigating. How do

865
01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:30.179
they differ from one another?

866
01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:37.580
Right. Well, so I briefly mentioned before that perception

867
01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:42.090
and cognition are represented in the w or ventral

868
01:07:42.899 --> 01:07:50.989
uh cortical stream and then a spatial organization in

869
01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:56.199
action including navigation of representing the where or dorsal

870
01:07:56.209 --> 01:08:07.260
cortical stream. And um uh they obey computationally complementary

871
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:11.100
laws. I'm gonna just say in words what they

872
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.899
are. And then it may be that one of

873
01:08:13.909 --> 01:08:19.299
the sly, one of the um copies I was

874
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.140
trying to make in my powerpoint was of that.

875
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.069
And I can actually show it. I'll run that

876
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:29.020
to my other study. So perception and cognition, use

877
01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:33.430
exci toy matching and match based learning. What does

878
01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.399
that mean? So if I read out a top

879
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:43.459
down expectation, um a prime the system for getting

880
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:48.020
ready to respond more vigorously to an expected event,

881
01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:52.279
oh, you're here, I recognize your face faster. So

882
01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:57.509
that's excitatory matching and match based learning means that

883
01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.169
you only go into adaptive resonance if what you're

884
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:07.149
expecting and what you're learning about uh c close

885
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.740
enough together. So you can suppress stuff and learn

886
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.520
a better and better critical feature pattern. So the

887
01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:18.990
learning is ex excited to it's match based and

888
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.330
the matching is side to it. But navigation and

889
01:09:22.339 --> 01:09:28.149
action use inhibitory matching and mismatch based learning. What

890
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.309
is an inhibitory match, let's say within our movement,

891
01:09:32.318 --> 01:09:36.568
I have a representation of where my hand is

892
01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:41.658
now and I wanted to go here. So this

893
01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:44.707
is my present position. This is my target position.

894
01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:47.689
Then I have a volitional go signal from the

895
01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.060
basal ganglia that makes my arm move from here

896
01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:55.580
to here. But when I get here, I am

897
01:09:55.589 --> 01:10:03.700
where I wanna be. So that present target minus

898
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:09.450
present is zero, that's inhibitory matching. And it turns

899
01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:13.910
out you use that mismatch in an appropriate way

900
01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:17.720
to tune the circuit so that when you are,

901
01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:22.020
where you wanna be the difference vector is zero.

902
01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:27.149
So first here, I can't see what I'm showing

903
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:27.660
you

904
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:29.279
I

905
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:33.640
can see it, here's a slide of adaptive resonance

906
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.959
and you can see the light green down here.

907
01:10:37.479 --> 01:10:41.819
Yes, that's the critical feature pattern so that you

908
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:45.950
have a top down match on the critical feature

909
01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:49.950
pattern. You go through an excitatory resonance to try

910
01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:56.850
to learn that. And the way that works if

911
01:10:56.859 --> 01:11:00.930
we're gonna discuss it is via the art matching

912
01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:02.770
rule. Uh MOVE

913
01:11:02.779 --> 01:11:05.250
it just a little bit to your left, please.

914
01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.509
Yes, like that. Yes.

915
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:12.080
So the what the art matching rule shows, you

916
01:11:12.089 --> 01:11:15.810
see, there's, if I have bottom up excited Tory

917
01:11:15.819 --> 01:11:21.580
input, it can fire a feature selective cells. If

918
01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:26.580
nothing else is happening, if I activate a category

919
01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:30.750
and I try to read out in those spreading

920
01:11:30.759 --> 01:11:37.459
green adapted pathways, uh AAA critical feature pattern or

921
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:42.250
prototype, I can't fully do it because I'm also

922
01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:50.899
activating this inhibitory of surround which approximately balances the

923
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:55.069
excitatory on center. That's how I prime. When I

924
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.120
read out that, that expectation, there might be some

925
01:11:58.129 --> 01:12:03.419
subthreshold activation of the cells that got activated and

926
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:06.490
a deep trough of inhibition around it. But then

927
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.589
if I have a matching bottom up input, it's

928
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.330
two against one, too excited to one bottom up,

929
01:12:13.339 --> 01:12:16.390
one top down one inhibitory, you can start to

930
01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:22.620
fire and that can lead to resonance. And I

931
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:25.390
don't know if we discuss, we're gonna discuss that.

932
01:12:25.939 --> 01:12:29.209
Uh What do you do if something unexpected happens?

933
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:34.490
There's a complimentary attentional system and orienting system where

934
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.810
the learning goes on the attentional system. And if

935
01:12:37.819 --> 01:12:41.000
you get a big enough mismatch or novelty or

936
01:12:41.009 --> 01:12:48.439
unexpectedness, it activates the oriented system which automatically discovers

937
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:51.859
a better matching category or a new category to

938
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.240
learn the new stuff. So, OK, that was a

939
01:12:55.250 --> 01:13:00.240
little a field. So sorry, let's get back to

940
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.180
your question.

941
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.569
Uh So then, I mean, why is it, why

942
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.660
do we need to understand learning then to properly

943
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:12.700
understand consciousness?

944
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:18.770
Well, to summarize my work shows that learning without

945
01:13:18.779 --> 01:13:24.580
catastrophic forgetting is solved by adaptive resonances. And that

946
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:29.259
properties of the adaptive resonances just after years of

947
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:34.770
modeling happen to support multiple conscious states with different

948
01:13:34.779 --> 01:13:38.259
functions in different parts of the brain. We reviewed

949
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:41.979
some of them, all of them are supported by

950
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:47.799
lots of explanations of modeling simulations and explanations of

951
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:54.200
data. So, um you know, science is never complete

952
01:13:54.209 --> 01:14:01.160
but um uh I'm I'm sort of baffled in

953
01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:03.600
a way, you know, we live in the world

954
01:14:03.609 --> 01:14:08.890
of Google, you can presumably search for anything in

955
01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:16.830
no time at all. And yet I've explained data

956
01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:22.729
from hundreds of experiments. Never mentioning the word quantum

957
01:14:23.419 --> 01:14:28.290
no quantum. Um There were quantum effects at the

958
01:14:28.299 --> 01:14:34.040
photoreceptors at the when you know noise hits the

959
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:39.629
the ear at the periphery right away, our brains

960
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.689
are designed to suppress quantum noise and to deal

961
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:50.609
with it to become deterministic. And yet today, there

962
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.240
are still people who are promoting that, you know,

963
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:58.200
consciousness must be quantum because they don't understand it

964
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:03.240
and must be in microtubules. So how do you

965
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:07.589
recite Keats out of a microtubule? That's beyond my

966
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.669
understanding. So there's overwhelming evidence that what I'm saying

967
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:17.910
is at least on the road to the truth

968
01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:23.169
and the thought experiments cannot be denied because the

969
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:30.910
hypotheses are familiar facts. Um When I grew up

970
01:15:30.919 --> 01:15:35.870
learning science, I thought you studied the theories that

971
01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:39.790
explain the most data in a principled way and

972
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:45.790
nothing comes close. So I hope some people are

973
01:15:45.799 --> 01:15:49.189
interested in studying it. And I wrote my book

974
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.839
in particular to be self-contained and non technical. But

975
01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:57.720
that being said, we are talking about the human

976
01:15:57.729 --> 01:16:03.379
mind, which is perhaps the most complex system in

977
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:08.069
nature that we can hope to understand scientifically. So

978
01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:13.870
uh it requires thoughtful reading. I have friends who've

979
01:16:13.879 --> 01:16:18.160
read it uh parts of it, you know, who

980
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:22.410
know no science at all. Um A rabbi, a

981
01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:27.669
pastor, a, a visual artist, a gallery owner, a

982
01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:33.160
lawyer, the social worker. Um AND they would read

983
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:36.839
the parts that interest them and, and that's possible

984
01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:39.470
because I wrote the chapter. So after you read

985
01:16:40.339 --> 01:16:45.930
the preface and introductory chapter, one, each chapter can

986
01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:49.700
be read independently of the others. So you don't

987
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:52.100
have to try to read the whole thing who

988
01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:55.290
has that much time or interest. But you know,

989
01:16:55.299 --> 01:16:59.290
if you're interested in about feelings, you can jump

990
01:16:59.299 --> 01:17:03.490
to the chapter about feelings and so on.

991
01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:08.560
So let me ask you now a little bit

992
01:17:08.569 --> 01:17:12.339
about the evolution of the brain. And actually earlier,

993
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:16.359
you've already touched a little bit on the idea

994
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:20.169
or the proposal that some people have of modularity.

995
01:17:20.279 --> 01:17:23.600
But what do you think about that idea more

996
01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:27.399
specifically about the idea of modularity of the brain

997
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.180
slash

998
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:37.299
mind? Well, brain anatomy is definitely specialized. There are

999
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:42.729
multiple brain regions that carry out different functions like

1000
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:48.279
vision, audition, cognition, emotion, and so on. But the

1001
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:53.419
processes aren't carried out by independent modules. In fact,

1002
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:57.729
if you look at f the famous Feldman and

1003
01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.259
Van Essen macro circuit, which I had a picture

1004
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:10.970
of um they all interact. Um I can't, you

1005
01:18:10.979 --> 01:18:13.000
see, I can't see it when, when you can

1006
01:18:13.009 --> 01:18:13.680
see it.

1007
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:16.169
Yes, but I can see it.

1008
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.109
Yes. OK. So on the one hand in the

1009
01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:25.790
lower right, that's the anatomical diagram by Feldman and

1010
01:18:25.799 --> 01:18:31.029
Van Een of the interactions in the visual system

1011
01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:37.810
dense bottom up, top down multiple stages. Remember, hierarchical

1012
01:18:37.819 --> 01:18:42.069
processing of uncertainty and the bigger picture if you

1013
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.439
could read it gives the functions carried out by

1014
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:51.399
different parts of visual cortex along with what region

1015
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.209
it is. And there are bottom up, top down

1016
01:18:54.220 --> 01:19:01.160
horizontal interactions and and as the figure says, the

1017
01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:06.140
bottom up horizontal and top down interactions overcome complementary

1018
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:13.229
processing deficiencies. So if it weren't for them, those

1019
01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:19.810
interactions nothing could be completed effectively. And moreover, each

1020
01:19:19.819 --> 01:19:25.370
of the processes do what one's called multiplexing information.

1021
01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:30.379
So a visual boundary, it's not just an edge.

1022
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:34.879
If you know, I the the famous example of

1023
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:38.450
a shaded ellipse, if all it was was a

1024
01:19:38.459 --> 01:19:43.750
bounding edge at the instead of a boundary, then

1025
01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:46.950
the color inside would just fill in and you'd

1026
01:19:46.959 --> 01:19:50.919
see a flat gray ellipse, but boundaries respond to

1027
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:58.459
edges, texture shading and depth. And so, um in

1028
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:02.939
addition to hierarchical resolution of uncertainty with all these

1029
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:08.439
interactions, each of the computations are multiplexing, multiple properties.

1030
01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:13.060
And as I said before, otherwise, you couldn't, I

1031
01:20:13.069 --> 01:20:16.680
couldn't ever learn to recognize your face. You know,

1032
01:20:16.959 --> 01:20:20.160
you have texture, you have shading, you have boundaries.

1033
01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:25.259
Um It's all overlaid. I have to be able

1034
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:31.020
to deal with it holistically. Did that help? No.

1035
01:20:31.029 --> 01:20:34.919
Yes, that helped. And uh earlier or just a

1036
01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:39.669
minute ago, actually, you mentioned how uh many theories

1037
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.350
of consciousness out there, people, apparently people who propose

1038
01:20:43.359 --> 01:20:47.649
them apparently do not even look at uh scientific

1039
01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:51.120
data. So, but why do you think there are

1040
01:20:51.129 --> 01:20:55.430
so many theories of consciousness out there? And uh

1041
01:20:55.439 --> 01:20:58.930
would you have a solution for how we should

1042
01:20:59.029 --> 01:21:00.850
actually approach it that

1043
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.540
we all have a conscious experience? So maybe we

1044
01:21:05.549 --> 01:21:15.009
feel entitled, but we also experience cognitive impenetrability, which

1045
01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:19.149
means that in our daily experience, if you don't

1046
01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.240
study neuroscience, you don't even know you have a

1047
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:28.470
brain. And for hundreds of years, people thought that

1048
01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:32.470
our experience was in our pancreas or our liver

1049
01:21:32.479 --> 01:21:38.290
or you know, so um you can't introspect the

1050
01:21:38.299 --> 01:21:44.169
answer. Mhm And so I don't believe that a

1051
01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:50.229
theory which discusses consciousness is a theory of consciousness.

1052
01:21:50.399 --> 01:21:55.319
Unless it can show how interacting brain processes give

1053
01:21:55.330 --> 01:22:03.350
rise to conscious psychological experiences, you have to make

1054
01:22:03.359 --> 01:22:08.189
the link and without a linking hypothesis between brain

1055
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.899
and mind, brain processes have no functional role and

1056
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:18.990
psychological processes have no mechanistic explanation. So you're high

1057
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.729
and dry. Now, as I mentioned, I'm lucky, I

1058
01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:29.720
started passionately studying psychology as a 17 year old.

1059
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.399
And that drove me because I always think in

1060
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:39.430
real time into studying brain dynamics, I I didn't

1061
01:22:39.439 --> 01:22:44.040
mention but I was driven into neural networks to

1062
01:22:44.049 --> 01:22:48.830
explain data about verbal learning, serial, verbal learning, how

1063
01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:53.529
we learn lists of anything. And I didn't know

1064
01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:57.180
they were neural networks. I had never studied, I

1065
01:22:57.189 --> 01:23:01.689
was a freshman after all cell bodies of neurons,

1066
01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:09.109
axons, synapses, synoptic knobs, transmitters, action potentials. They were

1067
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.839
all in my model from a psychological derivation. And

1068
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:17.049
so only when I talked to pre-med, friends who

1069
01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:21.529
were studying it in their pre-med courses that I

1070
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.160
realized the things that they told me they're learning,

1071
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:28.740
I already knew. So you have to make that

1072
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:34.919
link. And from a very early age, I discovered

1073
01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:41.580
a way to penetrate cognitive and penetrability and people

1074
01:23:41.589 --> 01:23:45.500
who want to know how I've done it and

1075
01:23:45.509 --> 01:23:49.959
others have tried to do it. Um They should

1076
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:53.209
read my book and then if they get really

1077
01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.399
interested. Um If you go to my web page,

1078
01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:04.979
which is just sites, si Tes dot Bu for

1079
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:16.160
Boston university.edu/, Steve Gsteveg sites W to use flash

1080
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.560
Steve G, you'll see maybe 570 archival articles and

1081
01:24:22.569 --> 01:24:28.299
quite a few videos of self-contained lectures and interviews

1082
01:24:28.609 --> 01:24:31.970
to learn more about it in detail. But my

1083
01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:36.680
book is one is a good, you know, one

1084
01:24:36.689 --> 01:24:40.950
place to go shopping for this information. There are

1085
01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:46.479
17 chapters on different stuff and it covers a

1086
01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:47.759
lot of stuff.

1087
01:24:49.879 --> 01:24:50.709
So yeah,

1088
01:24:52.169 --> 01:24:58.000
yeah. So what makes me frustrated with some very

1089
01:24:58.009 --> 01:25:01.620
well known scientists? I won't mention like the quantum

1090
01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:08.959
guys if they could explain even a tiny fraction

1091
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:12.509
of the amount of data I've explained by that.

1092
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:17.750
I mean, how brain dynamics give rise to parametric

1093
01:25:17.759 --> 01:25:22.660
psychological experiences in data. I would think they were

1094
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:27.459
making a serious contribution but they don't even try

1095
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:33.220
and, and they never try to compare their contribution

1096
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:37.399
with mine, which I just feel is unscientific. It's

1097
01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:41.129
not how I was brought up beyond bad manners.

1098
01:25:41.379 --> 01:25:46.810
It's unscientific, which is the severe criticism in my

1099
01:25:46.819 --> 01:25:47.779
lexicon.

1100
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:52.850
So let's move ahead here. I I think that

1101
01:25:52.859 --> 01:25:56.750
earlier we've already touched on what consciousness is good

1102
01:25:56.759 --> 01:26:00.970
for and you've also explained what resonance states and

1103
01:26:00.979 --> 01:26:05.490
resonance mean. So I mean, another thing that people

1104
01:26:05.564 --> 01:26:07.904
many times bring to the table when talking about

1105
01:26:07.915 --> 01:26:12.004
consciousness, particularly the philosophers. And this is something that

1106
01:26:12.015 --> 01:26:15.214
was coined, I guess by uh David Chalmers in

1107
01:26:15.225 --> 01:26:18.265
the nineties is the hard problem of consciousness. Do

1108
01:26:18.274 --> 01:26:21.625
you think that it can be solved scientifically?

1109
01:26:22.919 --> 01:26:27.350
Well, let me, um of course, it depends how

1110
01:26:27.359 --> 01:26:31.770
you define it. Let me just read first Wikipedia

1111
01:26:31.779 --> 01:26:36.819
says, and I'll quote, the hard problem of consciousness

1112
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:41.129
is the problem of explaining how and why we

1113
01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:49.589
have quality or phenomenal experiences, um how sensations acquire

1114
01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.410
characteristics such as colors and taste. So to a

1115
01:26:54.419 --> 01:26:57.359
certain extent, and I will come back to this

1116
01:26:57.370 --> 01:27:02.069
moment. All my theories do just that. Like my

1117
01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.410
theory of vision is trying to explain how we

1118
01:27:05.419 --> 01:27:12.439
see, you know, boundaries surf, you know, shading texture,

1119
01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:16.709
color, all these properties of surfaces, paintings and so

1120
01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.560
on. But let me just give another quote from

1121
01:27:19.569 --> 01:27:24.040
Nagel in 74. He wrote in part when we

1122
01:27:24.049 --> 01:27:29.750
see, for example, we experience visual sensations, the felt

1123
01:27:30.049 --> 01:27:33.259
quality of redness, the experience of dark and light,

1124
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:36.180
the quality of depth in a visual field. Other

1125
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:41.000
experiences go along with perception and different modalities, the

1126
01:27:41.009 --> 01:27:43.680
sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Well,

1127
01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:51.799
um one can give a scientific explanation of what's

1128
01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.740
going on in your brain when you see red,

1129
01:27:54.850 --> 01:28:04.149
dark and light depth, um sounds of instruments, but

1130
01:28:04.459 --> 01:28:11.220
no theory in science that's defined by mathematical equations

1131
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.859
as all scientific theories to the present have can

1132
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:21.180
experience the color red or any other conscious qualia

1133
01:28:21.459 --> 01:28:29.200
equations don't have qualia. But in other sciences um

1134
01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.979
like I I love this uh quote after you've

1135
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:41.140
read Lamb's huge treatise on hydrodynamics, you still don't

1136
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:45.479
know that water is wet, but you know, just

1137
01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:49.740
about everything you'd ever wanna know about water and

1138
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:56.029
other fluids, including air um to design airplanes that

1139
01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.859
fly boats that float on the surface of marines.

1140
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:07.459
You have an effective understanding of water and the

1141
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:12.379
fact that you don't know it's wet matters less

1142
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:16.649
and less because you can give a scientific explanation

1143
01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:24.470
of what is happening. First, what characterizes the state

1144
01:29:24.479 --> 01:29:29.330
of a liquid versus a gas versus solid through

1145
01:29:29.339 --> 01:29:32.020
the molecular theory of gasses and this and that

1146
01:29:32.029 --> 01:29:36.240
and the other thing. So it just doesn't matter

1147
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:41.120
after a while. And so in my life, given

1148
01:29:41.129 --> 01:29:49.279
what I know that I know um the fact

1149
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:56.680
that I'm seeing beautiful colors around me, I can

1150
01:29:56.689 --> 01:30:00.569
understand a lot of how that is happening and

1151
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:04.890
it is outside what an equation I can give

1152
01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:09.330
you representations of the objects and the colors and

1153
01:30:09.339 --> 01:30:14.419
their forms and their brightnesses. But I can't say

1154
01:30:14.899 --> 01:30:19.060
why it looks red. I can't because an equation

1155
01:30:19.069 --> 01:30:22.910
can't do that. And the the, but the answer

1156
01:30:22.919 --> 01:30:26.850
is an equation can't do that in any science.

1157
01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:35.250
You know, there's this famous um uh example, I

1158
01:30:35.259 --> 01:30:40.120
hope I'm remembering it right? You know, when um

1159
01:30:41.279 --> 01:30:46.379
astronauts were coming down and landing and they landed

1160
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:50.470
somewhere in, I don't know, Arizona or wherever or

1161
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:54.979
wherever, there was a flat arid surface. And the

1162
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.319
first thing I guess maybe these were the first

1163
01:30:58.330 --> 01:31:01.160
guys to the moon. I don't remember. But the,

1164
01:31:01.169 --> 01:31:04.959
the, the anecdote is the first thing they said

1165
01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:09.669
when they got out was the bump, was there?

1166
01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:15.350
Meaning that the computation of their trajectory coming in

1167
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:20.410
to the atmosphere predicted there would be a little

1168
01:31:20.419 --> 01:31:25.049
bump and it was there. But that's not the

1169
01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:30.629
same thing as the qualia uh f experiencing the

1170
01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:38.520
bump. Uh So science can be effective and useful,

1171
01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.790
but I do think it's outside the province of

1172
01:31:42.799 --> 01:31:48.859
equations to say why water feels wet, you know,

1173
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:52.939
we can say why a fluid has certain properties

1174
01:31:53.259 --> 01:31:56.790
but why it feels wet. I, I don't think

1175
01:31:56.799 --> 01:32:00.319
equations can do and if someone can, I, I

1176
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.859
will study them passionately. I don't see how it

1177
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:08.640
can be done in principle though. Mhm

1178
01:32:09.799 --> 01:32:12.859
So uh let's talk here a little bit about

1179
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:17.020
some of the applications of the way you approach

1180
01:32:17.029 --> 01:32:20.330
consciousness in your book. Before, toward the end, we

1181
01:32:20.339 --> 01:32:24.229
talk a little bit about uh principles of brain

1182
01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.959
design and some other general questions. So do you

1183
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:31.859
think that your approach to consciousness would have any

1184
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:36.399
implications for the way we understand mental disorders?

1185
01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.490
Well, um this is one of the things I

1186
01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:47.649
call an acquired taste, just like consciousness was an

1187
01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:50.290
acquire taste. It's not something I ever dreamed I'd

1188
01:32:50.299 --> 01:32:56.700
have anything to offer. Um But so all of

1189
01:32:56.709 --> 01:33:01.540
the neural models start by studying the brain dynamics

1190
01:33:01.549 --> 01:33:06.430
and mental functions of normal or typical individuals because

1191
01:33:06.439 --> 01:33:10.979
there are vast databases on that, you know, many

1192
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:15.060
hundreds thousands of scientists. Like if you go to

1193
01:33:15.069 --> 01:33:18.620
the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, I

1194
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:23.609
think a recent meeting at 26,000 scientists, they're all

1195
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:30.529
doing incredible work, huge databases. But at a certain

1196
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:37.089
point, I noticed that if some of the processes

1197
01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:43.930
get imbalanced or damaged in specific ways, then I

1198
01:33:43.939 --> 01:33:50.850
could see formal behavioral symptoms of mental disorders emerged.

1199
01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.799
And, you know, I just had to notice that

1200
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:58.140
it was in the model. Uh And so it's

1201
01:33:58.149 --> 01:34:03.089
in this spirit, I've so far explained behavioral symptoms

1202
01:34:03.359 --> 01:34:12.859
based on precisely defined imbalances. Remember, complementary computing is

1203
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:19.259
a balancing act or, or actual lesions in Alzheimer's

1204
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:26.160
disease, autism, uh Fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, medial temporal

1205
01:34:26.169 --> 01:34:30.759
amnesia, visual and auditory amnesia and neglect and problems

1206
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:33.830
of slow wave sleep. So that came in through

1207
01:34:33.839 --> 01:34:35.540
the back door just like all of it is.

1208
01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:38.700
So the moral of the story for young scientist

1209
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:45.750
is uh don't look for shortcuts, uh try to

1210
01:34:45.759 --> 01:34:51.740
understand the underlying principles and designs. Uh And then

1211
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:55.220
try to model it in an authentic and serious

1212
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:59.970
way. It's hard work. Uh Sometimes I wasn't ready

1213
01:34:59.979 --> 01:35:03.740
to even write down anything about a problem for

1214
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:09.180
10 or 20 years until I'd accumulated enough uh

1215
01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:14.740
information to be able to proceed. But then uh

1216
01:35:15.419 --> 01:35:17.560
I like saying it's the gift that keeps on

1217
01:35:17.569 --> 01:35:21.379
giving consciousness was part of the gift that kept

1218
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:25.009
on giving, understanding a little bit of mental disorder

1219
01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.120
is part of the gift that kept on giving.

1220
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:30.729
So if you try to get to the heart

1221
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:36.209
of the matter, it's richness will reward you many

1222
01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:40.089
times over. But I've been lucky because I started

1223
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:44.899
very young. And even though it's controversial for quite

1224
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:48.979
a few years before neural networks were even a

1225
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:55.209
thing, there were always enough people in Washington who

1226
01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.330
had faith in me and the work to give

1227
01:36:00.339 --> 01:36:03.700
us enough funding to do the work. And it's

1228
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:07.720
not like the kind of funding where you need

1229
01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:13.089
50 million to get a fancy machine. All the

1230
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:19.060
money that supported me paid for uh graduate fellows

1231
01:36:19.069 --> 01:36:23.479
ships and postdocs uh for people to learn from

1232
01:36:23.490 --> 01:36:26.419
me and learn to do science with me. So

1233
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:31.529
it's pennies on the dollar was a good investment

1234
01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:38.779
anyway. Um Did that say enough about that? Mhm.

1235
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.859
Uh

1236
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:42.410
And another topic that you also cover in your

1237
01:36:42.419 --> 01:36:48.020
book is irrational decisions. What is, what is an

1238
01:36:48.029 --> 01:36:52.899
irrational decision exactly? And why do we make them?

1239
01:36:54.839 --> 01:36:58.359
Well, you know, there are several different kinds and

1240
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:00.240
uh let me just make a comment before I

1241
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:05.580
focus on one kind in general. If a decision

1242
01:37:05.589 --> 01:37:11.319
fails to achieve one's goal, when another decision that

1243
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:14.910
would achieve the goals readily available, it wasn't chosen.

1244
01:37:14.919 --> 01:37:18.100
We may want to say they were being irrational,

1245
01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.200
you know, and just like in cognitive emotional interactions,

1246
01:37:22.569 --> 01:37:25.870
you might have feelings about stuff and you just

1247
01:37:25.879 --> 01:37:29.580
can't bring yourself to do it. Uh And there

1248
01:37:29.589 --> 01:37:31.990
are many factors that can cause it, including an

1249
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.959
experience with this kind of decision making or the

1250
01:37:36.970 --> 01:37:39.990
need to make a quick decision around the stress.

1251
01:37:40.319 --> 01:37:44.819
You know, there are speed accuracy, trade-off problems. But

1252
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:49.759
the most famous psychological database concerns what's called decision

1253
01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:55.459
making under risk. That is decisions in situations that

1254
01:37:55.470 --> 01:38:01.560
are uncertain because the outcomes are defined by probabilities.

1255
01:38:02.279 --> 01:38:05.270
You know, if you do this and that the

1256
01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:08.859
probability of getting this payoff is that if you

1257
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:11.339
do that and this the probability of getting that

1258
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:15.450
pay off is that and which do people choose?

1259
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:22.259
And um Danny Conman and Amos Tversky won the

1260
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:27.319
Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 for their experiments

1261
01:38:27.330 --> 01:38:31.200
in an algebraic model. They published to fit that

1262
01:38:31.209 --> 01:38:39.540
data in 1979 explaining paradoxical properties of irrational decision

1263
01:38:39.549 --> 01:38:45.259
making in probabilistic environments and their algebraic model, which

1264
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:50.049
is, you know, phenomenological model that tries to compress

1265
01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.819
the description of the data. And it is very

1266
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:58.500
useful, it's called prospect theory. But then in 1987

1267
01:38:58.509 --> 01:39:01.890
I think my student, Bill Gutowski and I uh

1268
01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:06.540
went beyond it in a uh well known article

1269
01:39:06.549 --> 01:39:11.790
in psychological review. Uh BECAUSE my article with Bill

1270
01:39:11.799 --> 01:39:18.279
introduced a real time neural network model, we gave

1271
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:22.109
it a name because I started realizing you got

1272
01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.169
to name everything you don't need to prevent other

1273
01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:30.040
people from plagiarizing it. I won't stop them. But

1274
01:39:30.049 --> 01:39:33.350
at least you could say that's just uh affective

1275
01:39:33.359 --> 01:39:37.660
balance theory is what we called it that quantitatively

1276
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:43.279
explains and simulated the Danny Kamman and Amos Tversky

1277
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:49.850
data as emergent properties. And all we did was

1278
01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:55.620
we applied my already known cognitive emotional model to

1279
01:39:55.629 --> 01:40:00.060
that data. So we didn't do any more modeling.

1280
01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:03.390
We showed that their data fell out of the

1281
01:40:03.399 --> 01:40:07.620
wash when the model was exposed to the kind

1282
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:13.979
of risky environments like those in prospect theory. So

1283
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:22.040
that I thought had an important lesson that Darwinian

1284
01:40:22.049 --> 01:40:27.930
selection does shape our mind to be adaptive, but

1285
01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:33.859
it it fails in certain environments. Um You know,

1286
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:39.729
it can't anticipate every kind of risky environment. And

1287
01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.109
in the same spirit in chapter 17, in my

1288
01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.080
book, I summarize other examples of irrational behaviors including

1289
01:40:47.479 --> 01:40:51.560
superstitious and self punitive behaviors in a similar way

1290
01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:57.149
how in certain environments, you know, and you know,

1291
01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:03.209
um conspiratorial thinking, sadly how certain social environments can

1292
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:10.009
support conspire uh conspiracy kind of ideas which we

1293
01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:13.169
see all too much in the United States these

1294
01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.290
days to say. So my abstract with Bill I,

1295
01:41:18.299 --> 01:41:25.049
I summarize a little here. These explanations illustrate that

1296
01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:28.399
the data concerning decision making under risk may now

1297
01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:33.049
be related to data concerning the dynamics of condition

1298
01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:40.270
and cognition and emotion as consequences of single psychophysiological

1299
01:41:40.339 --> 01:41:43.229
theory. So in other words, you didn't have to

1300
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.640
build a new theory and it really, and we

1301
01:41:47.649 --> 01:41:52.910
explained some risky decision making data that common and

1302
01:41:52.919 --> 01:41:57.339
Tversky could not like pref what's called preference reversals.

1303
01:41:57.350 --> 01:42:01.910
So our theory is more powerful both in the

1304
01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:08.399
sense of um uh explaining their data as the

1305
01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:13.359
merchant properties of known brain on the motional dynamics,

1306
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:17.180
but also explaining more data because Bill, you know,

1307
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:23.549
didn't experiment uh on the uh preference reversals. But

1308
01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.040
you know, our paper was published in 87 uh

1309
01:42:28.049 --> 01:42:32.299
Danny and Amos was in 79 They got the

1310
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:37.410
Nobel Prize in 2002. We didn't share it. So

1311
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:39.270
go figure.

1312
01:42:41.479 --> 01:42:45.709
Well, uh so we've already also touched on the

1313
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.649
or addressed the problem of cognitive impenetrability. So let's

1314
01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.950
talk about something that we, you've alluded to in

1315
01:42:53.959 --> 01:42:56.649
the beginning of our conversation, that is A I

1316
01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:00.509
system. So do you think that having a better

1317
01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.270
understanding of our brains give rise to minds would

1318
01:43:04.279 --> 01:43:08.069
also be important for designing A I systems?

1319
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:12.950
Well, you know, today, when people say the word

1320
01:43:12.959 --> 01:43:19.259
A I, they usually mean neural networks, which wasn't

1321
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:24.990
the case when A I was symbolic, Marvin Minsky

1322
01:43:25.259 --> 01:43:28.109
realized he ought to get on the gravy train.

1323
01:43:28.319 --> 01:43:32.209
In fact, there's a funny anecdote about that. Uh

1324
01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.629
Marvin Minsky and Seymour Pappert when they were doing

1325
01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.890
symbolic A I, they were at MIT and I

1326
01:43:39.899 --> 01:43:44.189
was an assistant professor and they really attacked me

1327
01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:50.100
brutally because I was doing neural networks. And Marvin

1328
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:53.060
when he was a young man tried to do

1329
01:43:53.069 --> 01:43:57.370
neural networks and he failed. And since Marvin was

1330
01:43:57.379 --> 01:44:00.379
the smartest man in the world. How can this

1331
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:04.399
little dipshit kid be allowed to do neural networks?

1332
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.990
They attacked me. Anyway, years later, after I'd found

1333
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.879
it and became first president of the International Neural

1334
01:44:13.890 --> 01:44:18.830
Network Society and the Archival journal neural Networks. And

1335
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:23.000
I was veteran chief for many years, I had

1336
01:44:23.009 --> 01:44:27.259
a lot of influence over the organization of international

1337
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:31.339
conferences on neural networks. And I said, let's invite

1338
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:35.279
Marvin Minsky because he had just written his book

1339
01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:39.899
Society of Mind, which basically was just plagiarism. But

1340
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:42.390
hey, that was nothing new for the People in

1341
01:44:42.399 --> 01:44:45.790
Tech Square. And I figured, let's hear what Marvin

1342
01:44:45.799 --> 01:44:53.299
has to say. Sadly, Marvin ever prepared. Um But

1343
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:55.100
he got up and the first thing he said

1344
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:58.640
was there are two things I regret in my

1345
01:44:58.649 --> 01:45:06.089
life. One was I underestimated gross Burt. And then

1346
01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:09.470
he, the rest of his presentation was telling jokes,

1347
01:45:09.939 --> 01:45:13.669
he wasn't prepared poor Marvin. He was such an

1348
01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:18.529
egotist amazing. And you know, he did some useful

1349
01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.870
earlier work and then he just, you know, shoveled

1350
01:45:22.879 --> 01:45:29.419
in the guilt anyway. Uh What can I say?

1351
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:38.959
So my neural networks illustrate autonomous adaptive intelligence and

1352
01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:41.299
not all neural networks do. So I was trying

1353
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:45.069
to say now when people say neural networks or

1354
01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:50.220
a I, they usually mean deep learning. And uh

1355
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:52.830
I published a paper a few years ago because

1356
01:45:52.839 --> 01:45:56.500
I was invited to where I explain why deep

1357
01:45:56.509 --> 01:46:03.890
learning is untrustworthy because it's not explainable. Mm If

1358
01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:06.959
you make a prediction, using deep learning and let's

1359
01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:10.979
say it's a medical prediction and someone dies as

1360
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:15.669
a result. And the surviving family are grief stricken

1361
01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:18.799
and they say, why did you tell the doctor

1362
01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:21.649
to do that? And your answer would be, I

1363
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.649
don't know, you're gonna be sued out for everything

1364
01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:30.680
you're worth. So it's untrustworthy because is unexplainable and

1365
01:46:30.689 --> 01:46:36.109
it's unreliable because it can experience catastrophic forgetting. In

1366
01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.069
fact, in 1988 I wrote a off sighed paper

1367
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:43.939
that I review in my magnum opus with 17

1368
01:46:44.370 --> 01:46:49.560
prop problems that back propagation which deep learning uses

1369
01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:53.970
as its learning engine still has that art never

1370
01:46:53.979 --> 01:46:57.859
had and yet they still choose not to use

1371
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:03.609
it. So deep learning is deeply flawed and then

1372
01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.580
chat GP t you know, a generative A I,

1373
01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:12.040
I mean, you know, they've thrown into it immense

1374
01:47:12.049 --> 01:47:17.720
databases, they scrub the internet. And so perhaps not

1375
01:47:17.729 --> 01:47:26.220
surprisingly, it can generate a lot of phrases and

1376
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:31.580
sentences that sound intelligent. But basically, you know, it

1377
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:36.129
starts with a sentential context and has a probabilistic

1378
01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:39.939
algorithm for trying to guess what to say next.

1379
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:45.750
The foundational problems are, it has no goals, it

1380
01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:49.220
has no meaning and it literally does not know

1381
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:54.790
what it's talking about literally. And in fact, um

1382
01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.149
on the connections website now, I don't know if

1383
01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:05.770
you follow it. There's been this very heated discussion

1384
01:48:05.779 --> 01:48:11.629
of this uh attack uh on A I of

1385
01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.189
this kind led by Gary Marcus who's a professor

1386
01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.509
at NYU and everything they're saying against it is

1387
01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.379
correct. But I believe the future of humanity will

1388
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:30.140
benefit from an A I that is increasingly autonomous,

1389
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:35.040
adaptive and intelligent in its algorithms, machines and mobile

1390
01:48:35.049 --> 01:48:41.939
robots, especially ones that embody brain inspired designs because

1391
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:46.919
these are the ones that can seamlessly interact in

1392
01:48:46.930 --> 01:48:56.979
brain machine uh um co-operative ventures. And I'm the

1393
01:48:56.990 --> 01:49:00.540
guy who's led that and we're well on the

1394
01:49:00.549 --> 01:49:04.490
way to it in terms of meaning, you know,

1395
01:49:04.930 --> 01:49:07.450
I don't want to presume that everything's understood. In

1396
01:49:07.459 --> 01:49:11.810
fact, just last year I published an article on

1397
01:49:11.819 --> 01:49:17.279
my web page about how Children learn in real

1398
01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:23.419
time from their parents and other teachers to learn

1399
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:27.979
effective and perceptual language meanings. It's not in my

1400
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:32.040
book. I wasn't ready to write that paper till

1401
01:49:32.109 --> 01:49:36.350
last year and that's just the beginning of what

1402
01:49:36.359 --> 01:49:41.500
has to be a huge a research program that

1403
01:49:41.509 --> 01:49:46.479
I clearly will not live to see completed. But

1404
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:52.140
at least now there's that foundation you can't say

1405
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:54.819
as people in a, I used to do all

1406
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:57.759
the time with the best game in town. They've

1407
01:49:57.770 --> 01:50:00.660
never been the best game in town, but they

1408
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:05.470
spend so much time marketing with people like me,

1409
01:50:05.479 --> 01:50:09.870
spend so much time thinking and writing and discovering

1410
01:50:10.890 --> 01:50:14.640
I, I can't do that. That's not why I

1411
01:50:14.649 --> 01:50:22.229
wanna stay alive. Um Yeah. So should I say,

1412
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.770
uh maybe I'll say, you know, the best example

1413
01:50:26.839 --> 01:50:31.620
of autonomous adaptive intelligence is the human mind. We're

1414
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:35.180
autonomous because we can act on our own. We're

1415
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:38.979
adaptive because we can learn throughout life because we

1416
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:44.569
solve the stability plasticity dilemma. And we're intelligent. Hm,

1417
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:47.359
at least in the sense that we can as

1418
01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:51.720
a species make wise enough decisions and plans to

1419
01:50:51.729 --> 01:50:58.919
create civilizations, even though we can be superstitious, conspiratorial,

1420
01:51:00.009 --> 01:51:04.459
terribly cruel and violent as well. And the end

1421
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:10.120
of my book discusses, you know, why they and

1422
01:51:10.979 --> 01:51:13.819
you know, there's a kind of Yin Yang in

1423
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:18.959
the human mind and good and evil are built

1424
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:24.140
right into us. But I also try to clarify

1425
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:31.000
why good has a a leg up. Um BECAUSE

1426
01:51:31.009 --> 01:51:36.379
bad things usually pub punished and either suppressed or

1427
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:41.689
avoided where you can, good things can be sustained

1428
01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:47.080
and you can build beautiful things, important, useful things

1429
01:51:47.089 --> 01:51:51.229
on them. So there's a broken symmetry and evolution

1430
01:51:51.779 --> 01:51:55.790
between good and evil and our lives depend on

1431
01:51:55.799 --> 01:51:55.979
it.

1432
01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.779
Uh So talking about good and evil and you

1433
01:51:59.790 --> 01:52:04.419
also mentioned a little bit earlier. Superstition. Uh DOES

1434
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:07.100
the approach that you present in the book will

1435
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:11.799
also have implications for how we understand things like

1436
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:16.790
morality, religion, creativity and the human condition where I

1437
01:52:16.799 --> 01:52:22.450
guess many of these topics are traditionally uh approached

1438
01:52:22.459 --> 01:52:23.500
in philosophy.

1439
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:31.979
Yeah. Well, um remember that Newton thought he was

1440
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:37.549
doing natural philosophy when you do deep science, it

1441
01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:45.229
gets philosophical, deep philosophical. Um Well, I wanna do

1442
01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.879
a quote chapter 17 in my book, likely discusses

1443
01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:53.720
some of these, the things they could be discussed

1444
01:52:53.729 --> 01:53:02.669
much more, more extensively on page 621 of the

1445
01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:06.149
header of this section in question is more or

1446
01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.990
less what I was just talking about symmetry breaking

1447
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:13.620
of positive and negative in cognition and emotion, coal

1448
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:16.990
and a reason for hope. I think hope is

1449
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.589
an important word and especially in our crazy world.

1450
01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.319
Let me just quote it. It's not too long

1451
01:53:26.089 --> 01:53:29.390
as with all predictive behaviors. There are cognitive and

1452
01:53:29.399 --> 01:53:34.609
emotional reasons for morality that are built into the

1453
01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:39.779
most basic properties of our brains in both cognition

1454
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:44.049
and emotion. There is, I'll argue a broken symmetry

1455
01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:49.620
between positive and negative processes with the positive emphasized

1456
01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:54.660
because it is just a broken symmetry. Much as

1457
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:58.359
every source of light can cast a shadow, both

1458
01:53:58.370 --> 01:54:02.060
good and evil deeds are possible. Although I would

1459
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:04.640
claim there's a built in bias toward the good

1460
01:54:04.979 --> 01:54:11.669
so that values aren't purely relative. And as I

1461
01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.500
was just indicating, uh an example of the broken

1462
01:54:15.509 --> 01:54:20.299
symmetry is that bad deeds are punished and punishment

1463
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:26.569
suppresses behavior uh which causes us to avoid them.

1464
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:29.870
Uh And if you don't avoid them, you end

1465
01:54:29.879 --> 01:54:33.770
up in jail or worse, whereas good deeds are

1466
01:54:33.779 --> 01:54:39.129
rewarded and thus can be sustained and built upon.

1467
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:44.370
Um And I believe in that very much, you

1468
01:54:44.379 --> 01:54:48.930
know, it's a broken symmetry that's not very romantic,

1469
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:54.459
but I think understanding it, you know, you don't

1470
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:57.080
have to understand much more than on the level

1471
01:54:57.089 --> 01:55:02.490
I said is very clarifying a lot of our

1472
01:55:02.839 --> 01:55:09.279
development and evolution due to broken symmetries. Um YOU

1473
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:12.680
know, and just look at us, we're bilaterally symmetric

1474
01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.049
but with broken, you know, we have a dominant

1475
01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:20.709
hemisphere in our cortex, uh we can be right

1476
01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.060
handed or left handed. So we are broken but

1477
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:31.779
we are symmetric and is built into everything. And

1478
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:35.160
I believe that a lot of uh the origin

1479
01:55:35.169 --> 01:55:38.850
of the universe, although I shouldn't talk about things

1480
01:55:38.859 --> 01:55:41.899
I know nothing about. I, well, not, not that

1481
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:44.370
I know nothing but I think a lot of

1482
01:55:44.379 --> 01:55:48.660
broken symmetries drove evolution. So,

1483
01:55:50.799 --> 01:55:55.009
so uh let's uh we've already also talked earlier

1484
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:59.450
about the brain design principles that you uh uh

1485
01:55:59.459 --> 01:56:02.700
go through in the book Complementarity and Certainty and

1486
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:06.049
Resonance. So perhaps let, let's go back to the

1487
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.729
very beginning of our conversation when I asked you

1488
01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:15.709
about when psychology slash neuroscience and physics diverged in

1489
01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:18.310
terms of their approach to the brain and the

1490
01:56:18.319 --> 01:56:21.180
mind. Do you think that the paradigm you present

1491
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:24.830
in your book can help unify them again?

1492
01:56:25.450 --> 01:56:28.709
Well, let me quote again from my book and

1493
01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.109
then if uh maybe I'll make some other comments

1494
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:38.950
on pages 635 and 636. Again, chapter 17, as

1495
01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:44.009
I explained in chapter five, brains can also bind

1496
01:56:44.259 --> 01:56:49.790
into coherent moments of conscious experience within a unified

1497
01:56:49.799 --> 01:56:56.899
self measurements taken from multiple physical sources light sound

1498
01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:03.810
pressure, temperature, bodily biochemical processes and the like. Um

1499
01:57:04.979 --> 01:57:06.879
SO like when someone asks, how do you feel

1500
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:10.629
today? You can tell them all sorts of stuff.

1501
01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:14.470
And it's not just like, you know, I have

1502
01:57:14.479 --> 01:57:18.069
a light meter, a sound meter, a pressure meter,

1503
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:21.660
it's all unified into a coherent moment of conscious

1504
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:28.500
awareness. So the brain is also a universal. Remember

1505
01:57:28.509 --> 01:57:34.040
I talk a little about that self organizing measurement

1506
01:57:34.049 --> 01:57:38.910
system of the world and in the world. Um

1507
01:57:38.919 --> 01:57:42.189
CHAPTER one explained that due to this universal measurement

1508
01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.049
process, brains may play a role that'll be compared

1509
01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:50.700
with the role played by played in physics by

1510
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:54.899
Max Planck's law of black body radiation. Cause by

1511
01:57:54.910 --> 01:58:00.470
describing a radiation spectrum that's universal across all matter

1512
01:58:00.939 --> 01:58:05.310
planks, lushes and quantum mechanics. Whereby to explain all

1513
01:58:05.319 --> 01:58:11.950
subatomic phenomena, the brain's universal measurement process can be

1514
01:58:11.959 --> 01:58:17.470
expected to have a comparable impact on future science.

1515
01:58:17.479 --> 01:58:25.729
So, you know, we don't, our brains don't function

1516
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:28.979
when it comes to cognition, emotion, et cetera on

1517
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:35.169
a quantum level. Um YOU know, even if there

1518
01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:41.959
are uh noisy fluctuations in individual cells, often cell

1519
01:58:41.970 --> 01:58:49.669
populations have mean activities uh that are much larger

1520
01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:53.299
than the variants. So we can have a a

1521
01:58:53.689 --> 01:59:03.140
kind of um uh deterministic or mean field dynamic

1522
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:10.560
equations or operating dynamics that's not operating uh with

1523
01:59:10.569 --> 01:59:16.479
quantum fluctuations uh needed to be considered. But we

1524
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:20.850
have this universality in terms of all these physical

1525
01:59:20.859 --> 01:59:26.240
fields as a measurement device that's self organizing. And

1526
01:59:27.959 --> 01:59:35.490
I um also in chapter 17, talk about how

1527
01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:42.560
some of these principles um like complementarity uncertainty and

1528
01:59:42.569 --> 01:59:51.509
resonance operate even in single non neural cells, a

1529
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:58.939
a very primitive uh cell types that have existed

1530
01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:05.169
long before humans. So there is a universal developmental

1531
02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:11.290
code in which art adaptive resonance is part of

1532
02:00:11.299 --> 02:00:17.529
that larger code. It is one example of the

1533
02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:24.959
kind of resonance that you find uh even in

1534
02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:31.310
morphogenesis of very simple species. Um So, you know,

1535
02:00:31.319 --> 02:00:34.770
I talk about the kind of resonance that occurs

1536
02:00:34.779 --> 02:00:40.569
when a blastula becomes a gastro, I talk about.

1537
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:47.569
Um uh WELL, you know, read the book, I'm

1538
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:50.729
getting a little worn out of my search and

1539
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:54.770
my brain isn't. So there is a universal developmental

1540
02:00:54.779 --> 02:01:03.100
code that um that includes the things that we

1541
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:08.939
experience when our brains start actually enabling us to

1542
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:13.930
remember what we know about the world. And resonance

1543
02:01:13.939 --> 02:01:18.700
goes way way back in morphosis. And you know,

1544
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:21.709
I've always thought, but you know, maybe if someone

1545
02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:26.479
makes this precise or shows its wrong, I've always

1546
02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:32.660
thought of um the double helix as an example

1547
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:39.339
of complementary computing. And you know, Barbara mcclintock got

1548
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:44.640
the Nobel Prize for showing it's very dynamic. Um

1549
02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:49.490
So, you know, if that is properly thought of

1550
02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:54.569
as an example of complementary computing, uh There are

1551
02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:59.589
many examples of this kind of complementarity uh throughout

1552
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:05.379
all of life, um et cetera, et cetera, et

1553
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:08.890
cetera. Uh And as I say, you know, when,

1554
02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.359
um so for example, some of the competitive dynamics

1555
02:02:14.370 --> 02:02:20.770
I discuss like mass action recurrent on center off

1556
02:02:20.970 --> 02:02:27.620
around networks competition uh is universal, not only when

1557
02:02:27.629 --> 02:02:29.979
you think of it on the species level, a

1558
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.359
a Darwin, but it also occurs at every level

1559
02:02:34.419 --> 02:02:40.009
of cellular organization. Uh So the aggregation of slime

1560
02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:44.910
molds is an example of a competitive dynamic with

1561
02:02:44.919 --> 02:02:51.080
an on center of surround recurrent network. Uh So

1562
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:57.270
there were these universal computational principles that are not

1563
02:02:57.279 --> 02:03:03.669
only about us that are also about all living

1564
02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:08.700
things. And you know, when I read theoretical physics,

1565
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:10.759
which I've been doing since I was a boy,

1566
02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.370
you know, I see what I view as physical

1567
02:03:16.379 --> 02:03:21.549
versions of on center of surround networks galaxy as

1568
02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:27.189
it were, you know, it's a balance balancing act,

1569
02:03:27.859 --> 02:03:30.640
but I can't say anything useful about that.

1570
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:35.310
So, uh let me just ask you one last

1571
02:03:35.319 --> 02:03:37.390
question then and I want to ask you this

1572
02:03:37.399 --> 02:03:41.109
because I also, I actually found it very interesting

1573
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:42.970
that you talk about this in the book and

1574
02:03:43.399 --> 02:03:48.180
whenever people in science talk about laws many times,

1575
02:03:48.379 --> 02:03:51.520
uh I mean, people get upset about talking about

1576
02:03:51.529 --> 02:03:54.439
laws that are not laws of physics, I mean

1577
02:03:54.450 --> 02:03:58.240
laws of biology, psychology or whatever. I mean, people

1578
02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:01.649
are not usually very fond of that. But do

1579
02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:04.770
you think that we can actually talk about laws

1580
02:04:04.779 --> 02:04:06.609
of cell biology?

1581
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:18.040
Well, cell biology is vast and these days he

1582
02:04:18.299 --> 02:04:26.149
biology usually means genetics. And uh I'm not a

1583
02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:31.040
geneticist, although I did just make a very speculative

1584
02:04:31.049 --> 02:04:37.479
comment about the double helix. Um So I'm not

1585
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:42.180
sure what context to put the question, you know,

1586
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:44.899
it is part of cell biology. What I said

1587
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:51.930
about um uh slime mold aggregation, their cells, their

1588
02:04:51.939 --> 02:04:57.649
biology, the growth of hydrous heads, their cells. It's

1589
02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:04.370
biology in that sense, there are examples of shared

1590
02:05:04.379 --> 02:05:11.970
laws, um you know, gastro relation, it's cell biology,

1591
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:15.100
it's not in a brain, there is no brain

1592
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:22.180
yet. So um I feel, you know, even my

1593
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:25.450
work has shown that what I'm doing is a

1594
02:05:25.459 --> 02:05:29.160
special case of more general laws that you can

1595
02:05:29.169 --> 02:05:34.609
see reflected in examples of cells in biology. But

1596
02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:41.399
um if you, if what you mean is genetics,

1597
02:05:41.410 --> 02:05:45.209
then I'm not a geneticist, but it does strike

1598
02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:51.089
me that the double helix. Uh AND for all

1599
02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:54.169
I know it's being done, maybe the stuff that

1600
02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:59.000
Barbara mcclintock got started is maybe being studied very

1601
02:05:59.009 --> 02:06:02.120
actively and I just don't read about it in

1602
02:06:02.129 --> 02:06:08.740
terms of the dynamics of those complimentary strands. Um

1603
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.169
YOU know, complementary computing generally gives you a form

1604
02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:17.979
of stability. You know, the Yin and the Yang

1605
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:24.250
alone aren't enough but together and bound by the

1606
02:06:24.259 --> 02:06:28.020
right kind of feedback. They can give you stable

1607
02:06:28.029 --> 02:06:34.200
organization just like with the boundaries and surfaces, for

1608
02:06:34.209 --> 02:06:37.680
example, like with the water and West streams, one

1609
02:06:37.689 --> 02:06:41.259
of the great triumphs of the watch stream, which

1610
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:45.490
I try to explain through models is how you

1611
02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:52.589
develop invariant recognition categories, size and variant view and

1612
02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:57.029
variant position variant. So I could recognize you from

1613
02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:03.649
any view, distance angle, you know. But the problem

1614
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:08.399
with being position and variant is at the place

1615
02:07:08.410 --> 02:07:12.180
where you're computing this and the anterior of infra

1616
02:07:12.279 --> 02:07:15.810
temporal cortex, I have no idea where your face

1617
02:07:15.819 --> 02:07:21.640
is in space. And that's what the, so that's

1618
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:24.459
in the W stream, the West stream gives a

1619
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:29.240
spatial representation. So you have to be able to

1620
02:07:29.250 --> 02:07:33.149
go from an invariant representation into the watch stream

1621
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:40.149
into a variant position representation in the West stream.

1622
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:47.810
And I explain how that happens. Um uh But

1623
02:07:47.819 --> 02:07:52.560
by themselves, you know, you'd have positions without objects

1624
02:07:52.569 --> 02:07:55.959
and objects, you didn't know where they are. So

1625
02:07:55.970 --> 02:08:00.080
each of them is useful and important, but it's

1626
02:08:00.089 --> 02:08:06.229
not enough his survival. So complementary computing on every

1627
02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:10.569
level of our brains is necessary for survival. And

1628
02:08:10.580 --> 02:08:14.379
it may very well be uh at every level

1629
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:18.629
of cell biology. But I'm not a person who

1630
02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:23.910
studied non brainin cell systems for long enough to

1631
02:08:23.919 --> 02:08:28.129
make a strong comment. I'd love to know more

1632
02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:31.129
about it. Maybe I'll do more of that. Uh

1633
02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.970
In my remaining years. I don't know.

1634
02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:38.319
Well, uh there are many other topics that of

1635
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:41.359
course, we could cover here because the book is

1636
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:45.959
massive and very detailed. And again, it is the

1637
02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:49.830
conscious mind resonant brain how, which brain makes a

1638
02:08:49.839 --> 02:08:52.720
mind and I'm leaving a link in the description

1639
02:08:52.729 --> 02:08:55.959
to it and I hope that my audience runs

1640
02:08:55.970 --> 02:08:58.109
and buys it. It's a very interesting book. And

1641
02:08:58.529 --> 02:09:01.250
uh Steve, apart from the book, would you like

1642
02:09:01.259 --> 02:09:03.830
to tell people where they can find you and

1643
02:09:03.839 --> 02:09:05.549
your work on the internet?

1644
02:09:06.689 --> 02:09:08.770
Oh, yes. So I had mentioned once, but let

1645
02:09:08.779 --> 02:09:12.729
me say again, I have a personal web page

1646
02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:25.180
sites, si tes dot bu.edu. So sites Boston University

1647
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:34.990
Education slash Steve Gsteveg. Um uh All my articles

1648
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.950
can be downloaded from there and quite a few

1649
02:09:37.959 --> 02:09:43.609
interviews and uh some videos of keynote lectures on

1650
02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:49.810
different topics. Um And if anyone wants to write

1651
02:09:49.819 --> 02:09:54.299
me with a question about my work, my email

1652
02:09:54.310 --> 02:10:02.740
is simple. It's just Steve Steve at bu.edu. Steve

1653
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:07.410
at bu.edu. So I love to discuss science. And

1654
02:10:07.419 --> 02:10:15.200
um um what can I say? I started 67

1655
02:10:15.209 --> 02:10:19.509
years ago and I'm still at it. And um

1656
02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:22.890
and that's a testimony and I only need to

1657
02:10:22.899 --> 02:10:28.209
my good luck but to really respect the foundations

1658
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:30.419
of what I was studying and not go for

1659
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:34.589
shortcuts and they've thrust me forward. So I never

1660
02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:38.549
hit a brick wall. And uh I've loved every

1661
02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.959
minute of it even though it's been really hard

1662
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:41.470
work.

1663
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:46.450
Well. And uh thank you so much for that

1664
02:10:46.459 --> 02:10:50.279
work and it's been an immense pleasure to have

1665
02:10:50.290 --> 02:10:51.930
you on the show. Thank you so much for

1666
02:10:51.939 --> 02:10:52.729
accepting the

1667
02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:55.939
invitation. Thank you for inviting me and I'll look

1668
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:59.580
forward to getting the URL for it so I

1669
02:10:59.589 --> 02:11:03.990
can uh hope I don't cringe too much.

1670
02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.740
No, it was great. It was great. So, thank

1671
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:09.169
you again.

1672
02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:11.089
