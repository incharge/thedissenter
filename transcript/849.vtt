00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.160
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.139
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.670
today I'm joined by Doctor Claudio 10. He is

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.260
a tenured research group leader in the Department of

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.139
Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of

6
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.719
Tubingen. This is our second interview. I'm leaving the

7
00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.690
link to our first one in the description box.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.979
Uh And today we're going to talk basically about

9
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.909
the differences between ape culture and human culture. So,

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.319
Doctor 10 Year, welcome back to the show. It's

11
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.900
always a pleasure to talk to you.

12
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.360
It's a great pleasure to talk to you and

13
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.040
thank you very much for having me a second

14
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.700
time. Thanks,

15
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.150
great. So OK, let's perhaps start with some basics

16
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.770
here. Uh How would you define ape culture? What

17
00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:52.819
is ape culture?

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.029
Right? Yeah. Well, uh ape culture would be cultures

19
00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.909
um shown by apes. But when we talk about

20
00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:04.720
culture generally, and this is uh always news for

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.360
newcomers to the field. At first, it turns out

22
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.879
that culture is quite a slippery fish. It's quite

23
00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.269
difficult to uh measure it to, to really get

24
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:17.809
hold of uh culture generally, not just in apes

25
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.680
anywhere. And um to see why that is, you

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.949
know, we can imagine that we can measure genes,

27
00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.830
you know, the existence of genes. Anyway, um what

28
00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.230
to make with this data is a different matter.

29
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.910
But we can measure them, you know, we can

30
00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.010
find them same for environment. You know, we can

31
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.410
measure the temperature somewhere, we can measure the humidity,

32
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.430
uh someplace and so on. But with culture, it

33
00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.870
is difficult, it continues to be difficult to really

34
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:49.120
measure our culture. Culture is something that happens out

35
00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:52.190
in the world sometimes stays out in the world

36
00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:55.089
such as cultural artifacts and so on. But it

37
00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.150
is also something that is very much in minds

38
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.989
in brains. And we don't have very good means

39
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.639
to get to these brains, you know, uh it's

40
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.830
not something that I personally do, for example. So

41
00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.690
the general approach had been then in the past,

42
00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.509
in order to try to pinpoint culture is to

43
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.100
take away the signal and the factors from other

44
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.259
um uh areas. So, for example, to try to

45
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.380
find, if you control for, if you measure and,

46
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.229
and um adjust for genetic differences, and if you

47
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.550
measure and control for environmental differences between populations, if

48
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.929
you do both of these things, the idea is

49
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.309
that what is left over, if there is some

50
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.199
difference, still left over between these populations, that you

51
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.889
can call that difference um cut. So it's an

52
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:55.000
approach that the philosophers call an X Negativo approach.

53
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.000
It's basically defining uh something by uh the absence

54
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.100
of all the other things. Um And that is

55
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.759
what, what culture has been uh come to be

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.490
seen. And also in the apes, I can talk

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.639
more later, maybe about this, but population differences between

58
00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:16.070
apes that are not very obviously linked to genetic

59
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.399
differences and um environmental differences, that's what people call

60
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.270
ape culture.

61
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.919
Uh And so, uh I would imagine that we

62
00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:31.509
can study ape culture through different means. So I

63
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.800
guess that perhaps some aspects of it could be

64
00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.630
studied in the lab, but we can also study

65
00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.669
ape culture in the wild. So, um uh what

66
00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.990
do we know about wild ape culture? And is

67
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.990
it similar or different to human culture?

68
00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.789
Yes. So wild ape culture is a prototypical case

69
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.320
of ape culture. Wild ape culture is what most

70
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.800
people focus on. Really when you, when you open

71
00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.089
up your TV channel and you see David Attenborough

72
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.690
come up and talk about, I don't know chimpanzee

73
00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.690
nut cracking or something and so on. And then

74
00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.220
they would invariably talk about some culture there. That's

75
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.160
what they are ultimately uh on about, they talk

76
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.549
about these dissimilarities between populations and they call that

77
00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:28.920
um culture. And again, uh when, when you ask

78
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:31.549
about the similarities, now, now we get into the

79
00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.700
topic of what we are talking about today. Um

80
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:38.940
The similarities uh there is some similarity in the

81
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.649
sense that indeed we also see in humans, population

82
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.829
differences, right, the way that I eat uh rice

83
00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.019
might be different to how some other people and

84
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:52.899
some other populations eat rice. Right? So there are

85
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.890
some differences and these differences can indeed be meaningfully

86
00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:01.950
linked to some cultural processes. So on that level,

87
00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.640
on the surface level, we are dealing with a

88
00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:08.429
similar phenomenon, we are dealing with population differences. And

89
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.899
by the way, if somebody were to say this

90
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.589
is a cultural difference, you know, on this very

91
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.989
rough level, just to talk about culture per se,

92
00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:20.459
I have no problem with that. Um uh If

93
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.910
you know, if the method of exclusion, that's this

94
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.690
method to exclude genetic and environmental differences. If, if

95
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.649
it had been applied correctly, uh then, you know,

96
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.670
I have no problem with that. But this does

97
00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:37.380
not mean that the culture specifics underlying these cases

98
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.459
are or must be the same. And this is

99
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.029
basically where I have the biggest difficulties always in

100
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.350
getting our main point across the main point from

101
00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:52.660
my research group is to say they, that is

102
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.559
not to say that apes don't have culture. This

103
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.380
is a point that is very frequently misconstruct. The

104
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.369
point is not to say that apes don't have

105
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.739
culture. The point is to say Ape apes have

106
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.700
culture, but that culture might be very different from

107
00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:13.079
the culture of humans. That's essentially our main point

108
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.179
here. Um Yeah, but, but, but, but the rest

109
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.540
of the devil is in the details and so

110
00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:19.959
on. Uh But I'm sure we're gonna get to

111
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.500
this. Yeah.

112
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.739
But do you think that when studying a culture,

113
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.260
uh we have to be careful about, uh what

114
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:33.929
would probably be some of the differences that arise

115
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.209
between, for example, studying it uh when the animals

116
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.859
are uh captive versus uh in the wild?

117
00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.359
Um Well, there are different opinions on that. Uh

118
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.809
The, the opinion, the main opinion is, I guess

119
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.869
for most people out in the world, many, most

120
00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.959
people are very interested in apes generally and they

121
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.399
are somehow very interested in ape culture generally. But

122
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.470
when they are interested in these things, they are

123
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.329
usually interested most in the wild ape cultural case.

124
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.000
However, you can also do similar methods, you can

125
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.320
apply them across different populations of captive apes, for

126
00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:23.380
example. And then you can find also some population

127
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.269
differences between these captive populations that suggests, it suggests

128
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:33.190
that perhaps we are dealing here with similar phenomenon,

129
00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:37.470
meaning that the similar phenomenon might be underlain by

130
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.049
very similar mechanisms as well. But here is where

131
00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:44.829
then some people um disagree. Some people would then

132
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.489
say there is a, there is a big difference

133
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.540
between wild apes and captive apes. And uh that

134
00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:55.309
is, I mean, theoretically speaking, you know, that could

135
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.980
well be. Um BUT then you look at the

136
00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:01.820
arguments and the there is already a problem, the

137
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:06.269
arguments that people then bring are go are pointing

138
00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:10.500
to completely the opposite patterns. So I'm not explaining

139
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:16.290
this very well. People make different claims with regard

140
00:08:16.299 --> 00:08:21.369
to this difference, wildly different claims. So some people

141
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.709
essentially claim I, I have to turn this down

142
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.250
a little bit here because we don't have much

143
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.839
time. Um So I'm painting with a very broad

144
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.049
brush here. Some people would then say that um

145
00:08:31.059 --> 00:08:35.320
captive apes are stupid. Again, I'm painting with a

146
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.200
broad brush. Uh So then they would say the

147
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.549
captive apes, they, they can't do very much and

148
00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:42.919
so on the wild apes, they can do many

149
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.909
more things and they are really clever ones and

150
00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.599
so on. So these people would then essentially claim

151
00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:54.250
that captivity impoverishes the cognition, um intelligence if you

152
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.510
so on, you know, of these things. But then

153
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.299
you look and some other people say the exact

154
00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:04.380
opposite. They say actually, you know, there is a

155
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.960
thing they call it a captivity effect doesn't matter

156
00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:10.150
what it's called now. And they say, oh actually,

157
00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:12.859
it turns out that the captive ones, they are

158
00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:17.760
the ones that are showing improved cognition. So there

159
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.549
is a huge problem here. And um logically speaking,

160
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:27.070
uh unless you finesse it down into more details,

161
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.070
logically speaking, on this level, one side must be

162
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.960
wrong, right? It cannot be both correct that they

163
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:37.570
are impoverished and improved in, in their cognition. So

164
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.789
that's already shown you um part of the divide

165
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.349
that we have in the field where people talk

166
00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:49.190
about different things without even agreeing on the basics,

167
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.570
even agreeing, they can't even agree on the overall

168
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.789
patterns as it were. But if you can't agree

169
00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.830
on this overall patterns, and it will be very

170
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.679
difficult also to frankly answer once and for all

171
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.039
the questions that you ask me, it's a good

172
00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:06.349
question. You know, is there a difference between the

173
00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:09.309
culture of the captive apes and the word? And

174
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.250
there currently it depends who you ask. Those people

175
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.469
who say that uh the the uh captive apes

176
00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:18.940
are impoverished, they will give you a different answer

177
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.570
than those who say uh you know, that the

178
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.710
captive apes are improved in their cognition or enhanced

179
00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:29.789
in their cognition. I personally think that the difference

180
00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:34.099
between wild apes and captive apes doesn't go as

181
00:10:34.109 --> 00:10:38.419
extreme in one direction or the other as some

182
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.869
of these scams have been made, right? Uh I

183
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.400
think also if you, if you think about it

184
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.690
for a second, the fact that that can be

185
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.840
people who, who promote the idea that, you know,

186
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.840
the the difference is like this, you know, and

187
00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:54.539
the others promote the exact opposite uh idea. Well,

188
00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:57.239
maybe what really is happening is that the, the

189
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.799
real difference is not all that great. And indeed,

190
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:05.849
um unless we talk about incarcerated apes and so

191
00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.989
on so forth, we, we might do so later.

192
00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:12.520
Um Unless you talk about this, the difference is

193
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.840
not that great. Uh And so my answer then

194
00:11:16.849 --> 00:11:19.380
would be quite similar. My answer would be to

195
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.440
say, captive apes are also able to um have

196
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.169
an ape culture just like wild apes do. It's

197
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:31.119
just that most people focus on white ape culture.

198
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.659
That would be my my personal short answer to

199
00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:37.809
that question. But I mean, I've also asked you

200
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.049
about that because sometimes when we talk about studies

201
00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:45.570
that are done in uh not only with animals

202
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.309
but also with uh humans in the lab, uh

203
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.020
There are people uh that bring to the table

204
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:59.330
criticisms regarding for example, ecological validity, right? Of those

205
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.909
studies. But I mean, perhaps I'm saying something that

206
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:07.250
is completely wrong and if so please correct me.

207
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.140
But uh I mean, I I if um couldn't

208
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.059
we treat, let's say captive animals or animals studied

209
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.890
in the lab as uh I mean, those artificial

210
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.760
settings as a different ecology. I mean, would that

211
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.820
make sense?

212
00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:31.390
It would, it would absolutely make sense. You know,

213
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.340
we can even go into an evil route. You

214
00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:37.000
could, you could and people have done that. Unfortunately,

215
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.340
in the past, you can take um single chimpanzees,

216
00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:43.070
right? So you it's a social animal and you

217
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.309
better treat them as social animals and you keep

218
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.690
them as social animals but, but people have taken

219
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.039
them and put them in single cages and that's

220
00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:53.320
not only is that super cruel, we don't need

221
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.260
to talk about that. Everybody would agree that that's

222
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.900
a cool thing to do but that kind of

223
00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:01.070
thing, that kind of thing I am convinced that

224
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.369
that does deprive these apes and it leads to

225
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.140
impoverished cognition. So how, how can we expand from

226
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.669
this uh case? Right, we can expand from it

227
00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.969
in, in the following way, I think we can

228
00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:17.530
ask the the more sensible question and the question

229
00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:21.909
that can be measured like how similar to the

230
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:25.539
wild do we need to create conditions in order

231
00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:29.739
to make these cases ecologically comparable? This is very

232
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.270
important because when we do that, we see that

233
00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:37.340
there is not one type of ecology for chimpanzees.

234
00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:39.770
Let's talk about chimpanzees. Generally, we can talk about

235
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.880
all the A I DS but chimpanzees are the

236
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.130
typical case to talk about. So when we look

237
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.679
at chimpanzees across, you know, Africa, uh we see

238
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.349
that they live too in very widely different situations

239
00:13:52.359 --> 00:13:56.369
in different environments, you know, but also in different

240
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.309
sizes of populations. That is simply the case, right?

241
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.179
Um So some live in small populations actually, you

242
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.109
know, this is there is also an interference with

243
00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:08.919
human observation there, but let's not go in in

244
00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:12.414
that direction. Um And some live in very big

245
00:14:12.424 --> 00:14:15.984
uh uh environments um in big groups and they

246
00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:19.275
live in this different environments too. So what we

247
00:14:19.284 --> 00:14:21.354
can glean from that is the following, we can

248
00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:23.825
glean from that. And, and we can also imagine

249
00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:26.325
that in the past in the environment of evolutionary

250
00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:29.155
adapted this of, of uh chimpanzees and so on.

251
00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:32.815
In the past, there were very likely more variability

252
00:14:32.825 --> 00:14:40.320
in their living conditions. So actually many different environments,

253
00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:44.469
social environments and physical environments, many different environments are

254
00:14:44.479 --> 00:14:49.289
compatible within chimpanzee life, which means that this is

255
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.460
good news as it were for those captive workers.

256
00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:56.590
Because now it's not altogether immediately clear that if

257
00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:59.030
you have a good zoo that provide the aids

258
00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:02.799
with uh big enclosure, say that keep them in

259
00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:06.159
uh social settings, the chimpanzees, especially in social settings,

260
00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:09.539
right? It's not immediately obvious and it's not an

261
00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:14.349
immediate, you know, Trump card against captive work to

262
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:17.460
say that there are some differences between this situation

263
00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:19.650
and the wild situations. You know, you can always

264
00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:22.650
find the differences. Yes. But the question is, how

265
00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:24.929
much do they matter? And if you frame it

266
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.530
like that, I think it's easy to see that

267
00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:30.750
the answer will depend, right? I would, I would

268
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.799
say uh some zoos are more ecologically relevant or

269
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:39.229
similar to the range of environments that uh wild

270
00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:42.890
apes have, right? Some are less, you know, yes,

271
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.099
in an ideal world, you, you take that into

272
00:15:45.109 --> 00:15:47.900
account, but that's why we always report also where

273
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:50.940
we run our studies. So later meta reviews and

274
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.549
so on can look out for these things. But

275
00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:57.330
as I said earlier, when we actually look, the

276
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.380
differences don't seem to be all that great. Again,

277
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.280
if people have widely different opinions on that. Probably

278
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:07.250
the truth is somewhere in the middle, which in

279
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.109
this case means they are not altogether incomparable. Yes.

280
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:18.270
So, uh going back to the wild apes specifically

281
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.380
earlier, I asked you, uh if their culture is

282
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.809
similar or different to humans when it comes to

283
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.840
the differences, do we know exactly what they are

284
00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:35.349
in what ways wild health culture is different from

285
00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.909
the human culture?

286
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:41.809
Um Well, many people, when you ask them, many

287
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.809
people would point immediately to language and they would

288
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.109
say humans have language and AIDS, don't that's what

289
00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:52.789
many people would say to a large degree. I

290
00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:56.659
think it's true. Then again, when, when, when you

291
00:16:56.669 --> 00:16:59.419
look more closely, well, what is language? Language is

292
00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:01.979
a form of communication, right? OK. Do apes have

293
00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:05.579
communication? Surely they have communication, right? They even have

294
00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.530
a communication on different channels, you know, they can

295
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.118
uh use gestures, they can use sounds, you know,

296
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:14.368
so it's not that there is a complete lack

297
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.670
of complexity, say in their, in their communication, right?

298
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.060
And then you get into essentially linguistics, lin linguistic

299
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.219
debates which are always tough to follow, let's say,

300
00:17:26.229 --> 00:17:29.569
right? Uh They are more for the specialists. And

301
00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:32.569
so let me just summarize what I think most

302
00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:35.420
linguists would say. They would say while that is

303
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.739
true that they have this communication, et cetera, et

304
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.030
cetera. There are some big differences still and what

305
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.369
you always find every year when you, when you

306
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.800
look at this literature, you know, the the the

307
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.109
aid researchers, they, they chip away every year a

308
00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:52.069
little bit, you know, they chip away at these

309
00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:55.239
differences, right? But the chips that they remove are

310
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.760
usually not very, very large. So the the the

311
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.949
overall picture is that a communication does, I think

312
00:18:02.959 --> 00:18:04.939
that it is fair to say does get closer

313
00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:08.369
to human language over time. But the steps don't

314
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.579
seem to be as big as they would ever

315
00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:14.660
reach a complete overlap. Let me put it this

316
00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:18.660
way, right? I'm not an ape language researcher. Let

317
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.199
me, let me, let me say it like that.

318
00:18:20.209 --> 00:18:23.079
But that is my interpretation from all of this.

319
00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:26.290
But in my own approach, I try to go

320
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.770
one step deeper. I take the following as um

321
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.420
as granted, one major assumption of my, my work

322
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.449
is also and I take this from the linguists.

323
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.430
Um THEY describe language in all kinds of ways

324
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.380
and some specifics of languages also that we learn

325
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.209
from each other, the words or in gestural language,

326
00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:52.170
you know, in sign language that the specific gestures

327
00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:55.229
from each other, right? The fact that we speak

328
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:58.385
English together, right? Uh I think none of us

329
00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:01.334
as a as a native speaker, right? That is

330
00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:04.545
because we learned these things from others and also

331
00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:08.155
even our native languages, we learned these things from

332
00:19:08.165 --> 00:19:11.224
others, right? We learned these words from others. But

333
00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:14.094
then what are words in a in a way

334
00:19:14.104 --> 00:19:19.390
um words are a specific type of information. Um

335
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.260
It's in the vocal domain, let's stick with the

336
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.650
vocal domain now. And it's sequences of certain pronunciations

337
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.290
and so on that you really have to learn

338
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.550
as this all sequences a slow. And in my

339
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.449
lab, we, we call this and other cases, we

340
00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:40.849
call that, know how, know how to pronounce a

341
00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:45.209
word, know how to pronounce the word uh printer,

342
00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:47.890
know how to pronounce the word word water bottle.

343
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.290
You know, that, that kind of thing it is

344
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.859
about, know how and, and I know uh you

345
00:19:52.869 --> 00:19:55.310
know, I've, I've moved away quite a bit from

346
00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:58.410
your original question. I haven't forgotten the question was

347
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.089
what is the difference between ape and human culture?

348
00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:05.119
Right? OK. So let's take for granted that language

349
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.780
is still the big difference maker. But now we

350
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.479
see that in order to get language, you need

351
00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:13.400
several factors as the linguist, they've got whole list.

352
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.459
But one of these factors that is necessary is

353
00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:20.599
that you need to be able to copy arbitrary

354
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:26.050
strings, arbitrary, know how. And another way of saying

355
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.819
that is you need to copy, know how that

356
00:20:28.829 --> 00:20:32.109
you yourself will not have come up with uh

357
00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:35.339
any time in your life unless you had copied

358
00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:38.489
it from others. So nobody wakes up in the

359
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.420
morning without ever having had contact with uh Mandarin

360
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.949
and speaks Mandarin. You know that that is just

361
00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:47.780
not the case. We all know this, but the

362
00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.579
the background to that is that it consists among

363
00:20:50.589 --> 00:20:54.280
other things of know how pronouncing all these words

364
00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.670
um that we could not just produce our own.

365
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.510
So our lab, we call that and I know

366
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.810
it's a bit of a mouthful, right? We call

367
00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:09.060
that super individual, know how s above individual beyond

368
00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:13.140
the individual. No, is the term. The whole idea

369
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.849
goes back to classical uh research and cultural evolution.

370
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.359
The whole idea goes back to Boyd and Richardson

371
00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:22.869
who pointed out that, you know, a special type

372
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.650
of culture, cumulative culture, I would like to add

373
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.189
cumulative culture of know how produces, you know, ways

374
00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:34.089
of doing things and so on. Um THAT nobody

375
00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:37.979
on their own could develop uh from scratch anymore.

376
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.390
So we just, you know, we just gave this

377
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.089
a label. Uh We, we specified a little bit

378
00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:45.489
more, we said it's about know how and we

379
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.449
specified uh you know, the whole idea in the

380
00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:52.844
extrovert super individual. So the difference then, and this

381
00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:55.635
is the high positive, but it's really very well

382
00:21:55.645 --> 00:21:59.665
supported by now, the difference is that humans have

383
00:21:59.675 --> 00:22:03.594
recounted them roughly and we found billions, billions of

384
00:22:03.604 --> 00:22:07.555
cases of super individual know-how across the whole planet,

385
00:22:07.564 --> 00:22:11.630
across all humans, billions. And then in the case

386
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.579
of the apes, you know, do they have super

387
00:22:13.589 --> 00:22:16.640
individual? Know how, I mean, the interview is continuing,

388
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.310
we can talk more about that. But let me

389
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:21.209
give you a very rough answer. And the answer

390
00:22:21.219 --> 00:22:28.390
is if, if apes have, I should specify un

391
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.310
incarcerated, untrained apes, if they have super individual know

392
00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:36.209
how they have it in very rare cases. So

393
00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.369
a couple of cases, maybe a handful of cases,

394
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.650
but maybe also they have none and these handful

395
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.579
of cases may be illusions. Um But then we

396
00:22:47.589 --> 00:22:49.930
have the answer in focus. Now the answer is

397
00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:54.079
essentially uh human life would be widely different. What

398
00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:58.089
is inconceivable in its current form. If we were

399
00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:00.760
to take all these super individual know how away

400
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.369
everything would come to a grinding halt. We wouldn't

401
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.155
have computers, we wouldn't have language, we wouldn't have

402
00:23:07.165 --> 00:23:08.885
any of these things, you know, you and I,

403
00:23:08.895 --> 00:23:11.234
we wouldn't uh be able to talk to each

404
00:23:11.244 --> 00:23:12.925
other, you and I, we wouldn't have names, you

405
00:23:12.935 --> 00:23:17.525
know. So that is what, what my approach has

406
00:23:17.535 --> 00:23:21.055
been for for many years now. Um TO say

407
00:23:21.064 --> 00:23:23.905
that the difference is that we humans, we are

408
00:23:24.114 --> 00:23:27.165
um we, we are able to copy, know how,

409
00:23:27.175 --> 00:23:30.045
even if there's no how it is super individual

410
00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:32.734
and we indeed do. And we have created all

411
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.005
of this around us in this

412
00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:37.619
way. OK. So perhaps I could save this question

413
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.510
for later. But since you brought it already to

414
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.869
the table, let's censor it now. So uh you

415
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.069
mentioned there the question, I mean, if other apes

416
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:53.109
have some, some form of super individual know how

417
00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:57.880
uh I mean, what are examples of that. And

418
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.459
I mean, what are examples of that where some

419
00:24:00.469 --> 00:24:05.000
people might claim that they in fact have that?

420
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.920
Yes. So um here is it is an interesting

421
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.500
approach. If you do the data approach, where you

422
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.560
actually look systematically, what are these cases, you find

423
00:24:16.569 --> 00:24:20.199
actually a different answer than when you ask people

424
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:22.400
like that at a conference. For example, when II

425
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.069
I do this kind of thing as well, I

426
00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:26.359
ask around, you know, I, I talk to people.

427
00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:29.099
So when I explain what I'm after and I

428
00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:32.699
explain, you know, I'm I'm after know how not

429
00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:36.540
know where food is, not know what food is.

430
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.920
You know, this thing, whether it's that thing, we

431
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.979
all know that apes can learn socially also about

432
00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:44.069
these things. When I say no, no, we are

433
00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:47.300
talking about know how more specifically not know how

434
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.609
that they can do on their own, what my

435
00:24:49.619 --> 00:24:52.030
lab calls latent solutions. It doesn't matter what we

436
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.140
call that, you know, let's stick with this. Know

437
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.500
how. So we are not talking about this latent

438
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.189
know-how, we are talking about super individual. When I

439
00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:03.369
explain all that, they give me answers such as

440
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.069
OK. But then for example, they would say, for

441
00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:10.750
example, Chimpanzee nut cracking would be uh one of

442
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.770
these cases, right? Chimpanzee nut cracking. Um I don't

443
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.750
need to explain, they use uh some hammers to

444
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.369
crack, open some nuts, you know, very cool behavior.

445
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.069
Nobody denies that. But it's a question is that

446
00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:24.229
a good idea, you know, to call that super

447
00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:28.640
individual, know how, in fact, um this is so

448
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.589
convincing to most people per se per se without

449
00:25:32.599 --> 00:25:35.829
looking at the data that uh the United Nations

450
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:41.209
have now uh started to protect Chimpanzee nutcracker. The

451
00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:45.660
United Nations protect Chimpanzee nut cracking. The whole idea

452
00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:48.839
there is that this is they don't use these

453
00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:50.880
terms. But the whole idea is that this is

454
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.489
so human like that, this is super individual. Know

455
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.790
how that this is not know how that the

456
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.530
apes would ever show unless they had developed this

457
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.219
culture around it. That's the idea, right? And again,

458
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.180
nobody is saying that this is a stupid idea.

459
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:07.530
You know, it's not a stupid idea. It's just

460
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.140
a matter of does it actually fit the data?

461
00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.479
And so what we have done is we have

462
00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:18.800
given um uh orangutans in two different zoos orangutans

463
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.079
untrained. So they were not trained to correct nuts,

464
00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:26.589
un incarcerated, you know, so they were not, their

465
00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:30.239
cognition wasn't changed by human interaction. Maybe that's the

466
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.260
shortest way I can describe this, you know, they

467
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.910
were left on their own and nobody showed them

468
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.569
how to correct these nuts, right? We asked the

469
00:26:38.579 --> 00:26:41.770
keepers, they promised us, you know that nobody showed

470
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.180
them how to correct these nuts, right. Well, they

471
00:26:45.189 --> 00:26:47.680
crack nuts, they use an animals and they crack

472
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:53.170
nuts spontaneously, right? So orangutans don't even crack nuts

473
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.839
in the wild. This would have been maybe the

474
00:26:56.849 --> 00:27:01.469
last remaining uh rescue hypotheses for the United Nations.

475
00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:05.739
Say when they say, oh, maybe they, they learned

476
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.189
it somehow we, because eventually, if you go back

477
00:27:09.199 --> 00:27:11.500
long enough in time, eventually some orangutans had to

478
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.709
come from the wild, maybe they brought this knowledge

479
00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:16.130
along. No, you know, orangutans don't crack nuts in

480
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.160
the wild, not that we know of anyway. And

481
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.599
so we have basically um uh an ape species

482
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.270
very relevant because it's an ape species, you know,

483
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.709
they are all very closely related to each other

484
00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:30.479
and to us um who didn't bring this knowledge

485
00:27:30.489 --> 00:27:33.310
from, there's no help from the world who wasn't

486
00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:36.089
trained to show this knowledge, who wasn't, you know,

487
00:27:36.099 --> 00:27:41.310
cognitively, um super enhanced by, by human incarceration. And

488
00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:43.300
we didn't show them how to do these things

489
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.089
and yet they take hammers and they crack nuts,

490
00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:52.260
right? So p definition is this is not super

491
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.290
individual. Nohow, by definition, it shows that the individuals

492
00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:01.199
could come up with this know-how. So this latent

493
00:28:01.209 --> 00:28:03.810
know-how, it's know how that they can come up

494
00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:08.099
with on their own. So exactly, unlike the example

495
00:28:08.109 --> 00:28:10.089
that I said earlier when I said nobody wakes

496
00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:11.859
up in the morning and just be able to

497
00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:14.969
speak Mandarin or, or Portuguese or, or whatever, you

498
00:28:14.979 --> 00:28:19.319
know, that doesn't happen. But in a is it

499
00:28:19.329 --> 00:28:21.869
does happen that, you know, they, they encounter the

500
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.949
situation and as long as they are motivated. It's

501
00:28:24.959 --> 00:28:28.910
very important, motivated to actually eat these nuts. We,

502
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.790
we tried this with chimpanzees as well and they

503
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.550
were not motivated to eat the nuts. And of

504
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.869
course, you can't study it. But you know, if

505
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.150
they are motivated, then um apparently they can do

506
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.609
it, you know, so the answer then that people

507
00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:45.390
give you what is super individual, know how in

508
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.199
the apes you can then go and you test

509
00:28:48.209 --> 00:28:50.699
it in these ways. And we have done many,

510
00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:54.780
many such tests. And the overwhelming result from all

511
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:59.010
these tests is that people make these claims, right?

512
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.760
And the claim, nobody you know is fine to

513
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.270
make this claim. But then you test it and

514
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.229
we showed many of these papers are still yet

515
00:29:08.239 --> 00:29:11.109
to be published. You know, uh we show that

516
00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:15.750
these kind of know how develop spontaneously in individuals.

517
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.310
And therefore it does not require the special human

518
00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:22.680
skill, it does not require the skill to copy.

519
00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:25.869
This is very important, the skill to copy super

520
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.770
individual know how instead all they need is uh

521
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.790
being able to trigger each other's latent, know how

522
00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:36.510
they do that. But that's a different thing, right?

523
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.650
I can this is a bad example because it's

524
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.500
a hard wire behavior, but I can trigger you

525
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.569
to yawn, you don't have to copy the know

526
00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:46.810
how of the yawn from me, right? Just to

527
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:49.410
give you an example that it happens in humans

528
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.739
too, but it's very rare in the human case,

529
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.000
right? We don't, that's not usually the way that

530
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.680
we work that we learn from each other. Right?

531
00:29:57.689 --> 00:30:00.140
But it is a typical way that the apes

532
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.949
learn from each other. And, you know, yes, they,

533
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:05.209
they, you have to have some social learning in

534
00:30:05.219 --> 00:30:07.650
the apes and it's clearly is there otherwise they

535
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.810
wouldn't have culture. Right. So, um if you bring

536
00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:13.670
it all together apes have culture, yes, but their

537
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.910
culture is different in the sense that they don't

538
00:30:17.219 --> 00:30:21.550
copy super individual, know how, which prevents logically, which

539
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.189
prevents the cultural evolution of this. Know how, because

540
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:28.920
if the apes, even if some ape comes up

541
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.050
with a super great uh know how on their

542
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.790
own. Let's imagine an ape genius uh scenario. Let's

543
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.599
just imagine this, this a genius comes up with

544
00:30:37.609 --> 00:30:40.750
a super great super individual or maybe a techni

545
00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.520
technological way to crack nuts like 100 in an

546
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.550
hour, you know, let's, you know, we humans do

547
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.140
this kind of thing. So why not? You know,

548
00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.880
so um this a genius comes up with that,

549
00:30:51.989 --> 00:30:54.160
but if the other apes are unable to copy

550
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.959
super individual, know how they are not in this

551
00:30:56.969 --> 00:31:00.790
example, they would not be geniuses. Well, the predictable

552
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.060
outcome would be that this invention would die with

553
00:31:04.069 --> 00:31:06.910
its maker. You know, all the others would do

554
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.250
the kind of things that they are able to

555
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.810
do on their own again, a long answer. But,

556
00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:14.849
but that is maybe the shortest I can do

557
00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:15.569
for this question.

558
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.859
Great. So uh before we move on to another

559
00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:22.489
topic, I mean, the questions I have asked you

560
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.660
up till now that were mostly related to wild

561
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:30.380
ape culture and how similar or different it is

562
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:36.280
to human culture. I mean, of course, uh intellectually

563
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.099
the I guess these questions are very interesting but

564
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.239
from the perspective of someone who's trying to study

565
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:49.339
and understand the culture, cultural evolution, why should we

566
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:52.770
bother with these questions? I mean, why, why does

567
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.410
it matter if wild ape culture is similar or

568
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.170
different to human culture and if similar or different

569
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.520
in what way, specifically, why should we bother with

570
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.619
this question? Um

571
00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:10.380
So generally speaking, I think what we are doing

572
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.650
in all these cases is we are not, we're

573
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.459
not producing anything, you know, this is not, you

574
00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:20.060
know, this is not feeding humans on the planet

575
00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:22.800
or the answer to this question, right? So it's

576
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.349
essential basic science, essentially basic science, but that we

577
00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:29.060
are doing here, we're just trying to understand systems.

578
00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:32.310
That's, that's what we do. And within that, I

579
00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:35.250
think we have got a couple of different approaches.

580
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.869
I am, I am a biologist by training originally.

581
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.500
Now, I'm also an archaeologist, but I am originally

582
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.119
a biologist. And so for me, it's just of

583
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.449
general interest to find out how apes behave and

584
00:32:48.459 --> 00:32:50.849
uh what ape culture is where it comes from

585
00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:52.979
and, and so on and to describe it, you

586
00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:56.030
know, so that's generally interesting, but there are a

587
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.160
couple of other things that are more broadly interesting.

588
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.239
Um So for example, to, to be able to

589
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.910
talk about animal culture, generally, we would need to

590
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.420
study as many animal species as possible. Some people

591
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.150
now even claim that plants have some social learning.

592
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.530
So we would have to include them in some

593
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.839
general very general cultural category. So apes then would

594
00:33:21.849 --> 00:33:24.290
be one part of this general puzzle that we

595
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.060
should study everything that we can in an ideal

596
00:33:27.069 --> 00:33:31.609
world. But in addition to that, um we can

597
00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:34.339
use this kind of knowledge, this hard gain knowledge

598
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:38.520
in order to try to understand um cultural settings

599
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.510
generally and cultural evolution generally and specifically for humans.

600
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.790
And here is where the apes of course play

601
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.689
very um large role. They play a large role

602
00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:53.790
because they are our closest living relatives. And so

603
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.680
in addition to being of interest in and of

604
00:33:56.689 --> 00:34:02.890
themselves, they are highly, potentially highly uh phylogenetic informative.

605
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.670
Uh IF we understand ape culture, it gives us

606
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:11.290
a handle to have a likelihood, understanding a likelihood,

607
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.978
understanding of uh the last common ancestor with apes.

608
00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.610
So if we find some patterns that are shared

609
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.570
among all living apes today, chances are good. Chances

610
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.149
are good is the implication that the last common

611
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.350
ancestor also shared in. It's not the perfect uh

612
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.830
uh data set, right. Ideally, we would have to

613
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.540
have hundreds of living ape species that would be

614
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.800
much better for this kind of influence. But it's

615
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.379
the best that we have, you know, and, and

616
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.879
so we should use it and then we can

617
00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.350
infer with a certain likelihood what the last common

618
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.530
ancestor ancestors culture was like. And we can then

619
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.100
build from that. And that is, that is my

620
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.449
other area of research. But I think we talked

621
00:34:56.458 --> 00:35:01.010
about that last time to a high uh degree.

622
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.000
So I would be refer listeners interested in that

623
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.239
what we are homing in our own past ancestors,

624
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.379
cultures like and so on that we, that we

625
00:35:10.389 --> 00:35:13.270
debated last time. So uh people could maybe listen

626
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:13.959
to that then.

627
00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:16.409
Yes, of course. And as I said, at the

628
00:35:16.419 --> 00:35:19.399
beginning, I'm linking to our first interview in the

629
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:22.520
description of this one. And by the way, just

630
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.389
to clarify when you mentioned that a certain point

631
00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:29.429
there, our last common ancestor with apes. Are you

632
00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:34.439
referring specifically to the last common ancestor? We have,

633
00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:38.989
we have with chimpanzees or going all the way

634
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.100
back to the one from which uh orangutans and

635
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.389
gorillas also wrenched.

636
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.340
I would, I would say the typical way that

637
00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.919
people talk about it, the last common ancestor and

638
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:52.810
they say it just like that and it's the

639
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.639
last common ancestor we have together with the chimpanzees

640
00:35:55.649 --> 00:35:59.929
and the bonobos, right? Um But my lab has

641
00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:02.979
also been, again, I would refer to the last

642
00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:05.580
interview we did has also looked at all the

643
00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.540
other apes and so on so forth. We should

644
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.820
really, ideally, we should look at all primates. Uh

645
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.139
But uh you know, that's hard to do. It's,

646
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:16.010
it's very difficult to get all the data for

647
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.580
the apes.

648
00:36:17.889 --> 00:36:24.850
So another question, then there's this similarity hypothesis that

649
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.979
people apply to the kinds of questions we've been

650
00:36:27.989 --> 00:36:32.090
talking about here. So what is the similarity hypothesis?

651
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.750
And what are the types of claims that people

652
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.419
have proposed in favor of it?

653
00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:41.419
I think if you ask around us the conferences,

654
00:36:41.929 --> 00:36:45.290
the the the the things that convinced most people

655
00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:49.429
sometime in their Androgyny, you know, um many are

656
00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:51.459
convinced this is how I started too. I was

657
00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:54.360
convinced by the similarity of hypothesis in the beginning

658
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.189
too. And then the data changed my mind, my

659
00:36:57.199 --> 00:37:00.060
own data uh changed my mind but also other

660
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:05.560
people's data. Um So many people arrived there because

661
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.739
they had heard this in school that all primates

662
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.879
of human like culture, sometimes this was just implicit

663
00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:14.899
by the teachers, you know, and then people just

664
00:37:14.909 --> 00:37:17.590
pick it up in this way. Sometimes it was

665
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.800
said explicitly, I've asked some people a little bit

666
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:25.409
about that, but many also arrived because in public

667
00:37:25.419 --> 00:37:28.530
uh common media, imagine Attenborough and so on. But

668
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.100
of course, other people in wildlife documentaries and so

669
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.449
on, the typical way that they describe these things

670
00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:37.129
is that they say, yeah, yeah, this is all

671
00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:39.489
exactly like in the human case. And then of

672
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.379
course, um, it looks also, I have to admit

673
00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:46.330
it looks at first it looks quite humanlike. Right.

674
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.379
Um, SO why would people based on that, why

675
00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:53.159
would they come away watching these things and hearing

676
00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:54.840
these things? Why would they come away with a

677
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.040
skeptical mindset? Right. There's absolutely no reason for that.

678
00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:01.889
But, and, and, and that's why I arrived at

679
00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:04.129
the scene, you know, uh like that, I, I

680
00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:07.020
believed, you know, that apes would have human like

681
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:11.939
culture. Um So, you know, if you look at

682
00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:15.520
that just superficially, there is something already wrong with

683
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.780
this uh approach because when you look even superficially

684
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.370
at ape life and then human life even cross

685
00:38:22.379 --> 00:38:25.909
culturally, you do see differences, right? So there is

686
00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:27.629
a problem if you think about it like that,

687
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.409
if you begin to actually compare with the human

688
00:38:30.419 --> 00:38:32.449
case, but let's not, let's not go in this

689
00:38:32.459 --> 00:38:36.669
direction right now, a different direction is to basically

690
00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:41.239
say what we, the the main convincing things are

691
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.159
that people see videos say of uh mother chimpanzee

692
00:38:45.169 --> 00:38:48.820
doing some things and then often cut videos, you

693
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.750
know, sometimes not even the same individual, but it

694
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.739
can be the same individual uh later on these

695
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:59.899
youngsters doing similar things, all right. Uh So that's

696
00:38:59.909 --> 00:39:03.229
very convincing to people, then I always point out

697
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.530
yes. But uh that is also the explanation that

698
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.820
people had in the past for um how birds

699
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.030
learn to make their nests, they believe was that

700
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.149
they always have to learn how to make their

701
00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:19.699
nest, how notice how, you know, they learn what

702
00:39:19.709 --> 00:39:22.850
material where this material is for sure. But the

703
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.719
how, that's the question and uh the crucial uh

704
00:39:25.729 --> 00:39:29.649
studies there were done uh many years ago, Colas

705
00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:32.159
and Colas, for example, did a study on river

706
00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:34.760
bird nest making weaver birds are fantastic because they

707
00:39:34.854 --> 00:39:38.254
super fantastic. N you know, super great design, seemingly

708
00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:40.465
very complicated and so on. So what they did

709
00:39:40.475 --> 00:39:43.135
is they took an egg, the beauty with birds

710
00:39:43.145 --> 00:39:44.475
is that you can take them as an egg.

711
00:39:44.485 --> 00:39:47.034
They can't have seen anything, right? And then they

712
00:39:47.044 --> 00:39:50.074
raised these eggs outside of the view of any

713
00:39:50.084 --> 00:39:53.879
nests, let alone nest making and then they ate

714
00:39:53.889 --> 00:39:57.750
it, you know, and uh these river birds completely

715
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.280
naive to nest and nest making, they made the

716
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:05.929
species typical nest and then, you know, people immediately

717
00:40:05.939 --> 00:40:08.360
get it, you know, they say, yeah, the, the

718
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.510
logic is super clear here. We may have assumed

719
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.100
that the birds have to copy how to make

720
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:18.479
the nests. But these kind of studies conclusively prove

721
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.520
that they don't. Hm. And then I say, ok,

722
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.689
now we talked about uh birds somehow, you know,

723
00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:28.500
birds are much less emotional and the logic is

724
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.600
much clearer to see, you know, let's go to

725
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.909
this, unfortunately, very emotional case of the apes. And

726
00:40:36.919 --> 00:40:38.790
what if I were to tell you that, you

727
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.530
know, you see mother chimpanzee do something, uh baby

728
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.919
chimpanzee do something if we now remove this knowledge,

729
00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:47.550
right? And they still do it. And I, I

730
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.629
told you about this one example in the orangutan

731
00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:52.280
case already, you know, they didn't have to see

732
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.989
these kind of things. It's logically, it's the same

733
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.429
structure in the river bird case as in the

734
00:40:58.439 --> 00:41:01.620
orangutan nut cracking case, if they can do these

735
00:41:01.629 --> 00:41:05.199
things on their own, it proves that the assumption

736
00:41:05.209 --> 00:41:08.629
that they have to copy these things was wrong,

737
00:41:08.639 --> 00:41:13.469
right? Um So that's, that's essentially one aspect. But

738
00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:16.290
there are, there are two more I think. Um

739
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.939
ANOTHER is that people point to uh to super

740
00:41:21.949 --> 00:41:25.310
rare behaviors. Uh And they say, look, you know,

741
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.689
this is similar to the human case. We've got

742
00:41:27.699 --> 00:41:31.489
this super rare behaviors only occurs here only occurs

743
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.719
here in this particular population of say chimpanzees. And

744
00:41:35.729 --> 00:41:39.239
again, the intuition, we can, we can long discuss

745
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.120
why that is the case. But I don't need

746
00:41:41.129 --> 00:41:43.219
to because people have this intuition already. So I

747
00:41:43.229 --> 00:41:45.770
don't need to explain why that is actually not

748
00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.560
a bad argument per se. Um But then we

749
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.790
tested that. So um I A Motes Rodrigo, my,

750
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.020
my phd student at the time and I, we

751
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.850
tested that and we looked at all these claims

752
00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.760
where people have said this kind of know how

753
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.439
only exists in this one population of one specific

754
00:42:03.449 --> 00:42:07.110
um species of apes and we asked around and

755
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.330
we look for the literature that came later. Uh

756
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.280
IF that is actually the case and we found

757
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.649
that in 99% of cases that was not the

758
00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:18.709
case or 98% you know, was not the case.

759
00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:24.250
Instead these things did repeat someplace else. They, they,

760
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.709
they, that shows that this intuition, even though it

761
00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:29.879
was not a bad intuition, you know, it was

762
00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:33.169
actually not correct in, in the vast majority of

763
00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:37.540
cases, a know how repeats across different things. It

764
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.750
pops up time and again. And then you have

765
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.040
to explain why does it pop up time and

766
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.939
again. And our approach is to say, well, because

767
00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:49.040
it is latently present anyway, right? And it requires

768
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:54.802
certain conditions, um motivational issues, environmental conditions, et cetera,

769
00:42:54.812 --> 00:42:59.123
et cetera, tiny details to then create different patches

770
00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:03.653
of these cultures everywhere. That's cultural. Let's let's be

771
00:43:03.663 --> 00:43:06.163
very clear about this, but it's different cultural from

772
00:43:06.173 --> 00:43:09.393
the human case because we culturally evolve our know

773
00:43:09.403 --> 00:43:11.833
how on top of this, you know, very different

774
00:43:11.843 --> 00:43:15.045
uh approach. Oh yeah. And uh and lastly, I

775
00:43:15.055 --> 00:43:17.845
think what many people are also convinced of is

776
00:43:18.016 --> 00:43:20.996
when they see, for example, let's say uh in

777
00:43:21.006 --> 00:43:24.385
a Hollywood movie these days, luckily Hollywood does a

778
00:43:24.395 --> 00:43:26.345
lot of CG I for apes and so on.

779
00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:28.375
But in the past, they would have a trained

780
00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:30.956
ape and that ape would act say very human

781
00:43:30.966 --> 00:43:36.560
like, right? And then they, this the number of

782
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.760
people who came to this belief because of these

783
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.239
kind of images goes down, I think, but they

784
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:47.179
still exist. And so they basically then say, uh

785
00:43:47.189 --> 00:43:50.469
look, I've seen apes act like humans. What are

786
00:43:50.479 --> 00:43:53.000
you, what are you talking about? Claudio, I've seen

787
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.780
apes look like humans and act like humans. So

788
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.550
they must have copied it from humans. And that

789
00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.129
is not true. We can, we can make a

790
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:05.149
bear ride a motorcycle in circles. It's not that

791
00:44:05.159 --> 00:44:07.310
I would do this, but we can. But that

792
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.610
doesn't mean that why natural bears ride motorcycles, right?

793
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:17.520
So we have to keep separate, trained behavior and

794
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.760
going even further, we have to keep separate and

795
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.239
incarcerated apes that you know, that are very special,

796
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.370
incarcerated apes are a special case. They are again

797
00:44:26.379 --> 00:44:29.719
irrelevant for the aggression of wild ape cultures. But

798
00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:32.590
it's much harder to see why they are irrelevant

799
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.379
for this case.

800
00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:40.760
But uh why should we study un inculturated and

801
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.000
untrained apes? What kind of information can we get

802
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:45.229
from

803
00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:48.580
them? So the again, the trained, the trained apes,

804
00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.239
if we, if we were to train a dog,

805
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:55.070
say, uh if we were to train a dog

806
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.219
to not like meat, let's just make it very

807
00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.409
simple. It's not about know how this is about,

808
00:45:01.419 --> 00:45:03.850
know what, know what to eat, but it doesn't

809
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.820
matter for now, then it's very easy to see

810
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:12.889
that this is not representative anymore for wolves. Why

811
00:45:12.899 --> 00:45:16.679
would wolves not like me, right. So if you

812
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:20.520
were to take, of course, dogs are uh domesticated

813
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.919
animals, we can use a non-domestic animal with a

814
00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:25.570
similar logic. It's easy enough to do. So let's

815
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.469
just stick with the dogs. Um So if we

816
00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:31.270
were to make them train them not to do

817
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.110
something, we can do that, right? Uh But that

818
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:41.969
is not um relevant for extrapolating what wild animals

819
00:45:41.979 --> 00:45:44.560
would be doing. This is just one example, but

820
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.909
they, the one generalizes, we can train animals generally

821
00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:52.510
via clicker training. I've done this myself, you know,

822
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.379
uh all kinds of race. Um We can do

823
00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:59.159
that and they perform things including even if we

824
00:45:59.169 --> 00:46:01.610
want to know how we can make a dog

825
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.139
done salsa, right? Uh We can do, we can

826
00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:08.250
install, know how in them that would never come

827
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:13.679
about in wild animals. That means that we need

828
00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:17.149
to exclude all of these cases where we train

829
00:46:17.159 --> 00:46:20.120
the, know how into these animals. Because the question

830
00:46:20.129 --> 00:46:24.560
is not, is decidedly not, can for example, an

831
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:28.629
ape, can an ape, can an ape show some

832
00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:32.350
human know how that question is a different question,

833
00:46:32.429 --> 00:46:36.050
that question we can answer yes because for example,

834
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.129
we can train them to our question here is

835
00:46:39.139 --> 00:46:45.489
different. Our question is can a spontaneously copy super

836
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.159
individual nohow, copy and spontaneous, you know, these, these

837
00:46:50.169 --> 00:46:52.750
are the two things that we have to have

838
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.050
in place because if they are not spontaneous. Um

839
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.469
And if it's not copying, then this is not

840
00:46:58.479 --> 00:47:01.020
what we are really after. You know, that's, that's

841
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.000
what we are after here. Oh, yeah. And with

842
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.719
the incarceration, the incarceration is a little bit complicated.

843
00:47:06.729 --> 00:47:10.560
So bear with me a little bit. Ok. Um

844
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:16.280
There are two general, two general approaches to explaining

845
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:22.929
why we humans have special social learning abilities. So

846
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.919
just so, you know, yes, I'm, my research group

847
00:47:25.929 --> 00:47:28.409
is a little bit special that we talk about,

848
00:47:28.419 --> 00:47:31.209
know how copying supervision, know how copying. So we

849
00:47:31.219 --> 00:47:33.570
specify it like that. But we are by no

850
00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.929
means alone in saying that humans have some special

851
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:42.489
social learning abilities. Others focus focus much more detailed

852
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.270
on imitation and so on. We think this is

853
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.750
too, too focused, you know, but it doesn't matter.

854
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.370
So we are not the only ones that say

855
00:47:48.409 --> 00:47:52.219
humans have got special social learning abilities, good. Keep

856
00:47:52.229 --> 00:47:55.179
that in mind. So now when we say there

857
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:57.620
was a whole class of social learning American that's

858
00:47:57.629 --> 00:48:02.139
special. Let's even not say what they are. Then

859
00:48:02.149 --> 00:48:05.310
there are two general approaches to this, how we

860
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.050
humans got to have these special social learning. One

861
00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.739
approach is to say they are adaptations, they are

862
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:16.139
natural adaptations. We have them in our genes essentially.

863
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.830
Again, I'm painting with a very broad product. These

864
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.520
people will then say, well, we are born with

865
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:28.260
these skills or we are born um in a

866
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.750
way that makes us have these skills very, very,

867
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.909
very likely, you know, OK, again, broad brush, let's

868
00:48:35.919 --> 00:48:39.020
not go into detail uh here. But there was

869
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:42.409
this other approach where people say yes, genes play

870
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:44.280
a little bit of a role, but they play

871
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.419
only a small role and they play an enabling

872
00:48:46.429 --> 00:48:50.699
role. They pro provide a small platform on which

873
00:48:50.709 --> 00:48:53.750
we build these skills and the skills themselves, these

874
00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:00.070
special skills, they are built into us socially. They

875
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.489
are built into us by culture itself. Very unintrusive

876
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.750
idea. Basically what these people say at the forefront

877
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.090
of this old movement right now is uh Cecilia

878
00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.020
Hayes. What these people are saying is we culturally

879
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:21.669
learn how to culturally learn. OK. So why am

880
00:49:21.679 --> 00:49:23.510
I, why am I mentioning this? You will know

881
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.810
this anyway, but I'm mentioning this because if that

882
00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.320
is true, let's just assume for this moment that

883
00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:31.000
this is true. This is the correct way. Let's

884
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:37.989
just assume then humans themselves learn these things culturally.

885
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:42.080
And if we learn this thing culturally, it stands

886
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.830
to reason that perhaps the ways in which we

887
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:52.050
transmit these skills, we could apply these skills and

888
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:57.209
make other species have these skills too that we

889
00:49:57.219 --> 00:50:02.850
can find soft means to install again, broad brush,

890
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.330
install in their brains, completely new skills, new abilities,

891
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:14.370
including new abilities to culturally learn. Uh And indeed,

892
00:50:14.379 --> 00:50:16.649
it seems to be, you know, this does not

893
00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:18.770
mean that this whole approach of the CD A

894
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.500
is is completely correct. Although these days, I tend

895
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.010
to believe that maybe it is right, but it

896
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.520
certainly is in favor of this approach that we

897
00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.830
see that if we train, if we put our

898
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.260
minds to it, if we put our intentions behind

899
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.449
it, if we apply everything that we can to

900
00:50:36.459 --> 00:50:43.020
make apes copy, nohow, we succeeded. We can, we

901
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.870
can make them different apes, we can change them,

902
00:50:46.879 --> 00:50:51.110
we can cognitively change them. We install something new

903
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.510
in their brains that they wouldn't otherwise have. That's

904
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.739
the other implication. And that is what happens intentionally

905
00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:00.870
or not. You know, it depends on the study

906
00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:07.760
uh when we incarcerate apes. Now, that means then

907
00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.439
because no ape is running around in the wild

908
00:51:11.449 --> 00:51:13.350
and no human is running around in the wild,

909
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.689
inculturated apes. And this is not the case now

910
00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:19.100
and this hasn't been the case in any time

911
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:24.169
in the evolutionary past of apes that we need

912
00:51:24.179 --> 00:51:27.770
to exclude. This is just very, very simple logic.

913
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.260
We need to exclude this incarcerated apes um from

914
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:35.669
our equation. They cannot provide the answer. They are

915
00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:38.520
interesting if you want to study the whole approach

916
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.389
of C VA and so on. They're very interesting,

917
00:51:40.399 --> 00:51:43.439
you know, for these other reasons. But if we

918
00:51:43.449 --> 00:51:46.889
want to understand what, why apes have and what,

919
00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:50.209
you know, how they make their cultures and by

920
00:51:50.219 --> 00:51:53.074
implication, what our last common answer that uh we

921
00:51:53.084 --> 00:51:56.985
must fully exclude uh incarcerated apes. That's why I

922
00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:00.524
whenever I absolutely can. I try not to study

923
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.274
incarcerated apes. You know, the only time when we

924
00:52:03.284 --> 00:52:05.995
do is if they are intermixed with un incarcerated

925
00:52:06.004 --> 00:52:08.995
apes and then we hope that the un incarcerated

926
00:52:09.004 --> 00:52:11.705
apes come first and test first. You know, then

927
00:52:11.715 --> 00:52:14.995
it's interpretable. If the incarcerated apes do it first,

928
00:52:15.004 --> 00:52:16.425
then it's uninterpretable.

929
00:52:17.879 --> 00:52:20.409
Ok. So, uh I mean, I wasn't planning on

930
00:52:20.419 --> 00:52:23.229
asking you about this, but since you mentioned Cecilia

931
00:52:23.239 --> 00:52:26.790
Hayes there, I've had an interview with her in

932
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.979
2019. And so I, I can't really avoid asking

933
00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:33.050
you this now. So uh I would like to

934
00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.695
ask you more about what do you think about

935
00:52:37.705 --> 00:52:41.854
her approach to culture? I mean, to what extent,

936
00:52:42.195 --> 00:52:45.235
but at this point in time, would you agree

937
00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:50.185
or disagree with her proposals and her claims? And

938
00:52:50.679 --> 00:52:54.709
if she, if she was correct, what do you

939
00:52:54.719 --> 00:52:59.300
think would be the implications in terms of how

940
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:06.659
we approach culture from an evolutionary sl slash phylogenetic

941
00:53:06.669 --> 00:53:11.179
perspective? Because I mean, wouldn't that change the game

942
00:53:11.409 --> 00:53:14.629
uh to some extent because there, there, there are

943
00:53:14.639 --> 00:53:17.752
people. Uh I, I mean, and I'm not saying

944
00:53:17.762 --> 00:53:20.693
they are wrong but uh when it comes to

945
00:53:20.893 --> 00:53:25.133
how culture evolved, uh they tend to think about

946
00:53:25.143 --> 00:53:30.972
particular uh cognitive mechanisms as having to be set

947
00:53:30.982 --> 00:53:33.572
in place in a particular species for it to

948
00:53:33.583 --> 00:53:39.083
be able to either uh have culture entirely or

949
00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:44.766
not, or to be able to have specific kinds

950
00:53:44.775 --> 00:53:50.115
of culture or cultural manifestations like language, for example,

951
00:53:50.125 --> 00:53:53.095
right? Uh But I, but I mean, I, if

952
00:53:53.105 --> 00:53:58.565
she was correct, wouldn't that have a big impact

953
00:53:58.575 --> 00:54:02.716
on how we think about culture, particularly from a

954
00:54:02.726 --> 00:54:04.355
biological perspective?

955
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:07.590
Several people in the past, I had proposed that

956
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.290
this whole idea of having all these modules in

957
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.489
the brain uh being evolved separately and so on,

958
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.729
it, it doesn't really work because we don't have,

959
00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:20.169
this is actually an argument made by Mike to

960
00:54:20.179 --> 00:54:23.810
Marcelo in his 99 book, The Cultural Origins of

961
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.090
Human Cognition. So Mike went a long way in

962
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:32.120
a similar direction as as Hayes, but he actually

963
00:54:32.129 --> 00:54:35.239
stopped short only of uh for a few stops,

964
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:38.500
let's say, um he said his argument was we

965
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:42.120
don't have much time, uh evolutionarily speaking, if we

966
00:54:42.129 --> 00:54:45.120
look at archaeology and so on uh to explain

967
00:54:45.129 --> 00:54:48.500
the human condition. And so this is just not

968
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.709
very convincing that we would have enough time to

969
00:54:51.719 --> 00:54:54.760
have all these modules installed in our brain. There

970
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.159
are the reasons why this was always a little

971
00:54:58.169 --> 00:55:02.189
bit dubious and Hayes just, just, I mean, she

972
00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:05.600
did a wonderful job, she went some steps further

973
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.219
and she said, OK, uh where Mike said, we

974
00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:12.939
have some adaptations such as he focused on imitation,

975
00:55:12.949 --> 00:55:15.310
a sub form of, of know how copying fine

976
00:55:15.689 --> 00:55:21.050
uh general perfect direction. Um uh Haman said, even

977
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.350
that even that has a cultural origin, right? Uh

978
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.689
And, and in her book, and in her B

979
00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:33.489
BS paper and so on. She listed quite convincing

980
00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:36.969
data sets and I'm sure you talked about that

981
00:55:36.979 --> 00:55:40.260
in the interview. It's quite convincing the case that

982
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.889
the cultural learning of cultural learning is the thing

983
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.530
in humans. But for my own approach, just because

984
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.260
this is important for, for, for me here as

985
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:51.959
well. For my own approach, it doesn't really matter

986
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:55.469
if there's no how copy this super individual, know

987
00:55:55.489 --> 00:55:59.270
how copying if we humans get the genetically broadly

988
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.760
speaking or culturally, as long as we have it,

989
00:56:05.469 --> 00:56:08.840
right? So my approach is mute on where it

990
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.989
came from it. I'm not saying it doesn't matter,

991
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.250
but it's for all current purposes is mute on

992
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:20.360
where it came from. Um uh As long as

993
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:22.860
it's there and as long it is as it

994
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.679
is uh meaningfully link to all these phenomenon here.

995
00:56:26.689 --> 00:56:29.989
And I think it is uh then um you

996
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.570
know, that that approach still works because in either

997
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.979
case, I would say in either case, you have

998
00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:41.800
this missing in the, you don't really see the

999
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.050
signature signal that super individual know how copying would

1000
00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:52.149
have led to in wild a culture, right? And

1001
00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:55.020
we don't see super individual know how copying spontaneously

1002
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.939
either. So putting it all together, you know, it

1003
00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:02.500
doesn't matter where we humans have it from what

1004
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:06.060
seems to be a factor that apes don't have

1005
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.750
it at all or they have it to such

1006
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.870
a low degree or so or show it so

1007
00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:14.610
rarely that it really doesn't translate in special types

1008
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.370
of culture that would be similar to the human

1009
00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:20.054
spec type of culture that we have here, right?

1010
00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:22.695
Um I should also say that maybe there are

1011
00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:26.935
other species that can copy super individual, know how

1012
00:57:26.945 --> 00:57:29.175
you know in some domains, some people talk about

1013
00:57:29.185 --> 00:57:32.945
whale song copying, you know, in a super individual

1014
00:57:32.955 --> 00:57:35.645
area, there is there was some debate around that

1015
00:57:35.655 --> 00:57:37.885
too. But be that as it may here, we

1016
00:57:37.895 --> 00:57:40.604
are talking about the apes, right? And they are

1017
00:57:40.614 --> 00:57:46.070
the phylogenetic uh meaningful comparison. And whenever we looked,

1018
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.679
uh we could not find these kind of things

1019
00:57:48.689 --> 00:57:49.530
in the apes.

1020
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.959
OK. So um let me ask you now about

1021
00:57:53.969 --> 00:57:57.530
uh another kind of questions. So uh we've already

1022
00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.689
mentioned a few times during the interview uh social

1023
00:58:01.699 --> 00:58:05.379
learning. So and of course to study ape social

1024
00:58:05.389 --> 00:58:09.719
learning, people use different kinds of tasks. And the

1025
00:58:09.729 --> 00:58:12.310
question I would like to ask you is do

1026
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.449
you think that the tasks that are commonly used

1027
00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:18.889
to study ape, social learning are suitable?

1028
00:58:20.489 --> 00:58:24.260
Yes. Yeah, I mean suitable for what? Right. I

1029
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:28.979
have to be quite blunt here. Um My blunt

1030
00:58:28.989 --> 00:58:33.810
reaction would be to say they are claimed to

1031
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:37.060
be suitable for certain purposes, the kind of purposes

1032
00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.139
that we talk about today in this interview. And

1033
00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:43.320
I think for that purpose, they prove to be

1034
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.600
unsuitable. Um Let me, let me explain a little

1035
00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:51.340
bit. The main task that is being used. Um

1036
00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.770
The main task that is being used is the

1037
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:58.020
so called um, two target task. It's essentially a

1038
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.030
task you can imagine. Uh IF, if we have

1039
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.080
a box here and this is a box here

1040
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:04.810
and then there is a, there is a door

1041
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.020
and the door can be pulled open, it can

1042
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.540
be pushed over, right. So you push it, you

1043
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.300
get the food inside, you pull it, you get

1044
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:15.489
the and then one group of Apes sees the

1045
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.159
the pushing, you know, another group of Apes sees

1046
00:59:18.169 --> 00:59:22.379
the pulling and then people say, uh oh, and

1047
00:59:22.389 --> 00:59:26.229
the result is frequently, not always, but frequently. Yes.

1048
00:59:26.239 --> 00:59:28.699
The ones that saw the pushing, they, they do

1049
00:59:28.709 --> 00:59:31.179
the pushing and the ones that saw the pulling,

1050
00:59:31.189 --> 00:59:34.709
they do the pulling good. And but, but then

1051
00:59:34.719 --> 00:59:37.020
on this level, there is no disagreement. I've done

1052
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.709
these tasks myself. And, you know, sometimes I find

1053
00:59:39.719 --> 00:59:42.179
I found this too. So the phenomenon is not

1054
00:59:42.189 --> 00:59:46.479
a question, the interpretation and the interpretation is that

1055
00:59:46.489 --> 00:59:49.739
some people, first of all, they then claimed we

1056
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:53.489
are looking at action, copy, at the behavior copy.

1057
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.639
But that can't be true because for example, here,

1058
00:59:56.649 --> 00:59:58.020
you know, I can make it so that you

1059
00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:01.290
don't even see my actions and these things move.

1060
01:00:01.409 --> 01:00:03.229
In fact, that was a point that Celia Hayes

1061
01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:06.870
made in, I think in the nineties. But apart

1062
01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:09.899
even from that, apart, even from that, there is

1063
01:00:09.909 --> 01:00:12.909
a bigger problem here. The bigger problem is that

1064
01:00:12.919 --> 01:00:17.949
people then thought doing these tasks. Um WE find

1065
01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:21.469
special types of learning, special types of learning that

1066
01:00:21.479 --> 01:00:23.550
we only find in the human case. And that

1067
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.520
explain all of the human culture here. Now, that's

1068
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.629
a huge problem because it turns out that not

1069
01:00:30.639 --> 01:00:35.100
just humans and not just apes copy in these

1070
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:39.760
tasks, dogs copy in these tasks. OK? Then you

1071
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.199
might say dogs are domesticated and so on, you

1072
01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:46.899
know, but recently, uh also reptiles copy in these

1073
01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:50.280
tasks, right? So if you want to take this

1074
01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:54.290
task performance and these two target tasks as a

1075
01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.949
special way of learning, you have got a problem

1076
01:00:56.959 --> 01:01:00.520
because then you would expect reptiles. I have nothing

1077
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.639
against reptiles, you know, but you don't just see

1078
01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:04.379
it, you, you don't see it, then you would

1079
01:01:04.389 --> 01:01:07.520
expect reptiles to have humanlike culture too. That really

1080
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.179
is the key. That is the first hint that,

1081
01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:12.260
you know, we have been barking up the wrong

1082
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:14.830
tree with these tasks. I can say that because

1083
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.070
I've done these tasks myself, right? So I think

1084
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.320
it's, it's fair if I, if I say this

1085
01:01:19.419 --> 01:01:22.409
done this task myself and I think we, we

1086
01:01:22.419 --> 01:01:24.889
have, we have been doing the wrong thing there.

1087
01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:29.489
The other big big clue is the empirical finding

1088
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.879
that if you look whether the apes, in this

1089
01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:36.090
case, the apes, if they can pull the door

1090
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.590
open on their own without having seen it pulled

1091
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.300
open or if they can push the door open

1092
01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.909
without having seen the door being pushed open, not

1093
01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:49.310
just the door of the board removal, leber movements.

1094
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320
You know, there are different versions of these cars.

1095
01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.709
In all cases. We've done a review on that

1096
01:01:53.949 --> 01:01:56.949
together with Lydia Hopper and Carl Von SYK. Um,

1097
01:01:56.959 --> 01:02:00.510
WE'VE done a review and we found, well, actually,

1098
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.419
uh as you might imagine because they don't sound

1099
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:07.030
very difficult these tasks, actually, the apes can just

1100
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.850
solve these tasks in all of these ways on

1101
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.469
their own. This is of importance for the current

1102
01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:16.250
interview as well because as I said earlier, we

1103
01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.810
what we need to find is know how copying

1104
01:02:19.899 --> 01:02:22.209
that is the copying of, know how that is

1105
01:02:22.219 --> 01:02:26.090
super individual. So we are back to the same

1106
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.465
kind of um learning in these cases that we

1107
01:02:29.475 --> 01:02:31.844
already talked about when we talked about the orangutan

1108
01:02:31.854 --> 01:02:36.185
not cracking. If you can potentially develop this, know

1109
01:02:36.195 --> 01:02:38.784
how on your own. Anyway, then all you need

1110
01:02:38.794 --> 01:02:41.854
is know how triggering you need triggering of know

1111
01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:45.905
how that is latently already there. That's very different

1112
01:02:45.915 --> 01:02:49.165
from copying, know how that you could not produce

1113
01:02:49.175 --> 01:02:52.254
on your own. So for this reason, these two

1114
01:02:52.264 --> 01:02:54.455
target tasks and there are many, many of them

1115
01:02:54.465 --> 01:02:58.479
and so on, you know, for this purpose, they,

1116
01:02:58.489 --> 01:03:01.659
they just don't work, they work for other purposes.

1117
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:04.350
Uh People are very interested in so-called social learning

1118
01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.100
biases and so on this is like the traffic

1119
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.810
lights for, for social learning under which circumstance to

1120
01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.070
your social learning. That's fine. Absolutely. You can use

1121
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.564
these tasks for that. You know, there is very

1122
01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:18.094
nice uh papers by Rachel Candle and others and

1123
01:03:18.104 --> 01:03:20.455
so on. Very nice. You can do that. But

1124
01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:22.784
for the current purpose, you know, human like culture

1125
01:03:22.794 --> 01:03:25.495
and so on, um it turned out empirically, you

1126
01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:28.814
cannot, you know, uh you can design maybe better

1127
01:03:28.824 --> 01:03:31.735
tasks uh that, that, you know, the the animals

1128
01:03:31.745 --> 01:03:34.175
cannot solve on their own. Um But you would

1129
01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.925
have to make sure in these tasks that they

1130
01:03:36.935 --> 01:03:40.139
are about, know how not about no, where, no,

1131
01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:43.399
what and so on. So again, as always, the

1132
01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:44.830
devil is in the detail. I told you at

1133
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.060
the very beginning, culture is a slippery concept and

1134
01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.459
it becomes even more slippery when you make these

1135
01:03:50.469 --> 01:03:53.070
distinctions. But I would argue we have to make

1136
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.909
these distinctions otherwise we don't get it, you know,

1137
01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.139
the distinctions between human and ape culture.

1138
01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:03.550
And so what would be in your opinion, suitable

1139
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.189
tasks to studying ape social learning?

1140
01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:13.649
Yes. So this task exists. Um The first was

1141
01:04:13.659 --> 01:04:17.229
done by uh by a consortium of, of researchers.

1142
01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:20.030
Um Michael Marcelo was there, Joseph Cole was there

1143
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.209
as well. And what they did is they essentially

1144
01:04:23.219 --> 01:04:28.229
they um made some chimpanzees learn new begging gestures.

1145
01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.949
Mhm Translated into this interview in, in uh one

1146
01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:36.750
would say they taught, they taught, they trained them,

1147
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.909
they trained them, you know, this is not to

1148
01:04:38.919 --> 01:04:42.370
be confused with copying these, these animals didn't copy

1149
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.090
Mike and just happen. And the others, you know,

1150
01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.050
they train these animals to show, you know how

1151
01:04:48.379 --> 01:04:52.540
to beg from humans, know how good. And uh

1152
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:56.729
and then uh I think 18 observer chimpanzees saw

1153
01:04:56.739 --> 01:04:59.810
this new, know how be being used as a

1154
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.040
begging gesture, you know, and what happened is uh

1155
01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:06.449
these uh these observers saw it and every time

1156
01:05:06.459 --> 01:05:09.409
this uh train chimpanzees would use this new begging

1157
01:05:09.419 --> 01:05:11.850
gesture, they would get food. It was a perfect

1158
01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.209
begging gesture, you know, from the perspective of these

1159
01:05:14.219 --> 01:05:17.649
observers. Now, did any of these observers copy this

1160
01:05:17.659 --> 01:05:21.320
new know-how, including I think one son of one

1161
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.919
of the demonstrators, you know, so it's, it's exactly

1162
01:05:23.929 --> 01:05:27.479
this mother uh kid relationship that we always see

1163
01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:30.669
uh in these wild shows, you know, no, not

1164
01:05:30.679 --> 01:05:33.280
a single one of them copied uh any of

1165
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.659
these know hows, right? So these, these are suitable,

1166
01:05:36.945 --> 01:05:39.485
you make them ideally, you make it so that

1167
01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:42.274
you've got a large baseline. You, you check really

1168
01:05:42.284 --> 01:05:44.504
if they show any of this uh no how

1169
01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:48.284
on their own spontaneously. And then if they don't,

1170
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:50.814
you train them to show that and you show

1171
01:05:50.824 --> 01:05:53.685
this to others. And I myself have because I

1172
01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:55.985
always thought this is exactly the kind of study

1173
01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.284
that we need. This is the gold standard study.

1174
01:05:58.544 --> 01:06:00.875
So my group uh we have done a couple

1175
01:06:00.885 --> 01:06:04.165
of these studies and overall, I think we have

1176
01:06:04.175 --> 01:06:08.939
now tested, I, I wanna say over 100 apes

1177
01:06:08.949 --> 01:06:13.459
different species, you know, all general actually. And um

1178
01:06:13.479 --> 01:06:16.750
in no cases, in no cases, did we find

1179
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.800
any time any super individual know I copy? This

1180
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:25.219
is very strong evidence that our hypotheses that we

1181
01:06:25.229 --> 01:06:29.199
held uh was always correct. Right. Um Or let

1182
01:06:29.209 --> 01:06:30.820
me, let me, let me put it so that

1183
01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.570
it's easier digestible. Maybe for, for those still skeptical,

1184
01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:39.320
given that we tested, I think over 100 chimpanzees

1185
01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.879
uh oh no, over 100 apes of different general

1186
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:45.889
and that none of them ever copied super individual

1187
01:06:45.899 --> 01:06:49.330
know how in a technical domain in a non-technical

1188
01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:53.770
domain uh from, from aid demonstrators from human demonstrators

1189
01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.530
and majority conditions. So several showed them, you know,

1190
01:06:57.719 --> 01:07:00.949
uh in all kinds of ways. And given that

1191
01:07:00.959 --> 01:07:04.070
we never found any super individual know our copying,

1192
01:07:04.469 --> 01:07:08.350
not it, it supports the view that if apes

1193
01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:14.330
have supervision or copy they applied either super rarely,

1194
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:19.600
right? Or are very weakly. This is of high

1195
01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:22.850
importance because all the cultural evolution models show that

1196
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.959
you need a certain threshold level of both the

1197
01:07:26.969 --> 01:07:30.479
frequency, the reliability of the social learning and the

1198
01:07:30.489 --> 01:07:33.649
strength of this social learning. So said in this

1199
01:07:33.659 --> 01:07:36.330
way, even if they sometimes very rarely do this,

1200
01:07:36.689 --> 01:07:39.909
it just wouldn't be enough to have them have

1201
01:07:39.919 --> 01:07:43.399
this kind of human culture that we humans have

1202
01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:45.350
right. So that is, that is, I think a

1203
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.989
strong statement that we can make with the data

1204
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.330
that we have at hand right now.

1205
01:07:51.929 --> 01:07:58.270
OK. And so what can we tell from those

1206
01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.040
data then? Because I would imagine that uh one

1207
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:06.120
claim that someone could make, could make is something

1208
01:08:06.129 --> 01:08:11.209
like, OK. So then does this all mean that

1209
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.629
uh apes do not socially learn and they do

1210
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.069
not and cannot have culture? I mean, I is

1211
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.009
that a plausible claim to make

1212
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.129
it is not a plausible claim? I have said

1213
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:32.270
extremely explicitly. I think in the last uh paper

1214
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.040
uh I said apes, I think I quote myself

1215
01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:39.180
correctly here. Apes have culture and nobody denies this.

1216
01:08:39.459 --> 01:08:42.299
I could not say it more strongly, right? Apes

1217
01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:45.720
have culture. Nobody denies this. Nobody I know denies

1218
01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:50.180
this. But what we need is a pluralistic approach

1219
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:54.000
to culture. Not all cultures are created equal, right?

1220
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.620
And so apes have many different types of culture.

1221
01:08:57.629 --> 01:09:00.799
They have very, we know this securely. They have

1222
01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:04.179
cultures of know what to eat. Maybe they would

1223
01:09:04.188 --> 01:09:06.389
even starve if they wouldn't have this culture, know

1224
01:09:06.398 --> 01:09:08.457
what to eat. It's very strong in that they

1225
01:09:08.469 --> 01:09:10.917
learn socially what to eat, you know, from those

1226
01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:13.229
around them, from their mothers and so on. That's

1227
01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:15.599
a, that's a culture, but it's a different culture,

1228
01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:19.078
but they clearly have it. They also have got

1229
01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:21.328
to know where cultures, where to be, you know,

1230
01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:25.167
and they also quite surely know their territory and

1231
01:09:25.179 --> 01:09:28.188
so on, you know, so they socially learn that

1232
01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.778
too. So they've got all kinds of cultures, but

1233
01:09:30.788 --> 01:09:33.923
when it comes to know how their culture is

1234
01:09:33.934 --> 01:09:37.823
basically uh uh about no le and know how

1235
01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:41.224
that they trigger. In each case. Uh I use

1236
01:09:41.233 --> 01:09:43.764
this term, by the way from Dan Sperber, he

1237
01:09:43.773 --> 01:09:46.413
made this very useful distinction between the stuff that

1238
01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:49.673
is already kind of there and just needs triggering

1239
01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:53.203
and the stuff that really needs copying. And um

1240
01:09:53.212 --> 01:09:55.664
Andrew Bask and I, we have recently worked on

1241
01:09:55.673 --> 01:09:58.474
that to lay more detail in, in that it's

1242
01:09:58.483 --> 01:09:59.983
a, it's a paper and press, I think you

1243
01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:04.180
recently interviewed Andrew as well. So um so that

1244
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:06.819
that difference is very, very important when it comes

1245
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:10.220
to know how the know how is triggered but

1246
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:12.799
not copied in the sense that we have been

1247
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.959
talking about this year. But in order in order

1248
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.979
to have all of these things and language, you

1249
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:22.609
know, and many other subdomains of human culture, we

1250
01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:25.660
need know how copy and without it, we we,

1251
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:28.709
we cannot get that. So um I would even

1252
01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.180
say it like this apes have many types of

1253
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:33.720
culture, but they do not seem to share in

1254
01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:36.959
this special type of culture that we humans have

1255
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.680
and maybe other species have maybe whales and all

1256
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.620
right. But I would also say that this also

1257
01:10:43.629 --> 01:10:47.069
doesn't mean that humans have all types of possible

1258
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.080
culture that is also not the case bats, for

1259
01:10:50.089 --> 01:10:53.439
example, they communicate in ranges that we can't communicate

1260
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.910
in. So, you know, we wouldn't have this kind

1261
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:58.330
of uh culture if, if the bats have special

1262
01:10:58.339 --> 01:11:01.415
types culture based on that, right? So you need

1263
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.745
to always look what kind of cultures do these

1264
01:11:03.754 --> 01:11:06.185
species show. And we see that there is a

1265
01:11:06.194 --> 01:11:09.115
difference in the kinds of cultures that apes and

1266
01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:11.774
humans show just like there was a difference between

1267
01:11:11.785 --> 01:11:14.584
uh different other kinds of animals in the cultures

1268
01:11:14.595 --> 01:11:18.250
that they show. OK. So with all of that

1269
01:11:18.259 --> 01:11:21.310
in mind, I have one last question then. So

1270
01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:25.419
we've talked about uh differences or potential differences and

1271
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:29.549
similarities between ape culture and human culture. A a

1272
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.129
different kind of question and related one is where

1273
01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:38.029
do those differences come from?

1274
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:42.709
Yes. Uh Well, Ricardo, uh this is the million

1275
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.939
dollar question and um and I don't think we

1276
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.709
have a very good answer to that yet, you

1277
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.500
know. So I think there is some good answers

1278
01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:57.299
maybe more convincing uh to some than to others,

1279
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.479
to all the other questions that you had. Um

1280
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:03.990
But for this one, we are quite in the

1281
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.529
dark yet. I have argued and I might have

1282
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.569
used the same argument in the last interview that

1283
01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.430
we did. Um I have argued in the past

1284
01:12:12.439 --> 01:12:14.620
that in order to try to shed light on

1285
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:18.310
this particular question, why we got the way that

1286
01:12:18.319 --> 01:12:21.470
we got? And so on, we should first answer

1287
01:12:21.479 --> 01:12:24.919
the question. When did we go the way that

1288
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:28.189
we got first? And if we have a good

1289
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.859
understanding of when we became like that, then uh

1290
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.779
we can look at the circumstances that acted at

1291
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.189
the time and at the time, directly preceding it.

1292
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:40.560
And that is ultimately the reason why even though

1293
01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:44.410
I was a psychologist and a biologist before, um

1294
01:12:44.419 --> 01:12:47.810
that now I still maintain these directions, but that

1295
01:12:47.819 --> 01:12:50.830
I'm now an archaeologist. So now I'm I'm trying

1296
01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:53.350
to understand this when this is my, my current

1297
01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:54.350
quest as

1298
01:12:56.149 --> 01:13:00.020
great. So, Doctor 10, uh as I said at

1299
01:13:00.029 --> 01:13:02.839
the beginning, I'm also leaving a link in the

1300
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:06.200
description box to our first interview. Uh Would you

1301
01:13:06.209 --> 01:13:09.529
like to mention again where people can find you

1302
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.209
and your work on the internet?

1303
01:13:12.069 --> 01:13:14.169
So uh if you Google my name or it

1304
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.080
will, the things that pop up will be the

1305
01:13:16.089 --> 01:13:19.259
Google scholar account. Of course, my, my website would

1306
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.700
be probably uh currently the best place. It's a,

1307
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:24.299
it's a Google site as well and, and easy

1308
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:25.049
to find. Thank you

1309
01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.129
so much. OK. Thank you so much again for

1310
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.689
coming on the show. It's been a real pleasure

1311

to talk to you.

1312
01:13:32.069 --> 01:13:34.089
Thank you so much. Thanks. Maybe that is the

1313
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:34.930
third time. Let's see.

1314
01:13:34.939 --> 01:13:39.259
