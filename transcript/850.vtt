00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.809
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.380
today I'm joined by Doctor James mccann. He's Professor

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.609
Emeritus of History at Boston University. His research and

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.639
teaching interests include agricultural and ecological history of Africa,

6
00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.139
Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa field research methods

7
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.579
in African studies, the Agroecology of tropical disease and

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.829
the history of food slash cuisine in Africa and

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.669
the Atlantic world. And today we are going to

10
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.889
focus mostly on his book, Maize and Grace, a

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.779
History of Africa's Encounter with the new world crop.

12
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.759
So, Doctor mccann, welcome to the show. It's a

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.430
huge pleasure to everyone.

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.419
Thank you for your invitation.

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.869
So, uh let's start, I guess at the beginning.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.930
So uh we're going to talk about maize here

17
00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:00.970
today. Where did maize originate from?

18
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.300
Maize is a new world crop that was um

19
00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:12.639
domesticated by peoples in Mesoamerica. And it's difficult, we

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.180
don't know the exact the first example of something

21
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.589
we would call maize in the common term. But

22
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.790
there are examples of, of um archaeological evidence of

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.089
forgive the bat cave where they found something that

24
00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.769
looks a bit like maize that has is on

25
00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.949
a, on the ear with a, with a cob.

26
00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.790
Um And the evolution is the experimentation by local

27
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.680
farmers. We don't know men and women both were

28
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.069
involved probably. But we don't really know that in

29
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.129
Mesoamerica, but the characteristics that were evolved over time

30
00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.379
was farmer selection of certain characteristics they wanted to

31
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.449
have available in their own diets and their own

32
00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.809
food. And maize is remarkable and it's spread internationally.

33
00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.000
That's why my interest in the arrival of maize

34
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.730
and its propagation in Africa. It it's about farmer

35
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.839
household, local knowledge only to some degree about elite

36
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.070
a applications. So it's the earliest history we don't

37
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.419
really know for sure. The spread me America into

38
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.759
North America and as far as New England. And

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.720
for example, this is an exa example of a

40
00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:32.089
New England flint and eight rows and it's not

41
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.679
something commercially viable, but it represents the kind of

42
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.500
movement of, of, of Mays into new environments. This

43
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.149
other example here you see this looks like what

44
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.679
Columbus would have brought with him. He brought Mays

45
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.570
back from the Caribbean, a Caribbean red flint, which

46
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.759
is this one to Europe and he sent it

47
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.320
to his friends in different places in Germany and

48
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.669
Italy and Spain. And it began to be experimented

49
00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.039
with and eventually was taken over by farmers themselves

50
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.759
who were the key innovators both in Africa and

51
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.610
in Europe. When May spread as this popular crop

52
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.330
that had certain characteristics that were overwhelmingly popular with

53
00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.860
farmers as they sought to both be commercial but

54
00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.720
also to feed their local populations.

55
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970
And what are some of those characteristics? What are

56
00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.830
the most distinct traits of mace

57
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:31.149
maize is one, it is wind pollinated in another.

58
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.029
It's not pollinated by insects or by um by

59
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.529
other means. And on the maize plant, you have

60
00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.440
both male and female parts of the plant plant.

61
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.160
So it can self pollinate. But for the most

62
00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.919
part, the wind moves the pollen between fields and

63
00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:51.360
between plants. So you get automatically a mix, genetic

64
00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.160
mixing that gives you a final result of texture

65
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.440
color and the characters characteristics of the plant itself.

66
00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.279
So it has this characteristic that farmers have, have,

67
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.710
have the ability to control it by by hand

68
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.220
moving the column. Um SO that they have characteristics

69
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.110
that they favor whether it's color or texture or

70
00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.358
for example, how long it stores? Uh SOME varieties

71
00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:19.390
of maize do not store very long at all,

72
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.428
you have to consume them or they go bad,

73
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.700
other ones will last longer. So farmers are making

74
00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:28.320
these choices over generations. What the end result is?

75
00:04:28.329 --> 00:04:32.769
You find the difference between these two. I would

76
00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.410
say it's all about the farmer choices. Another lead

77
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.950
scientist, the farmer choices at the early level and

78
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.130
the popularity of it as it spread around the

79
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.790
world was because it was controllable along with other

80
00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:51.179
new world. Um ADDITIONS like capsicum pepper. We can't

81
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.540
recognize world cuisines without recognizing the contribution of pepper

82
00:04:55.549 --> 00:05:01.989
capsicum. Uh In Indian, Indian Ethiopia, all varieties of

83
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.190
taste that we value coming from those new world

84
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.890
exchanges with new world. Yeah.

85
00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:13.059
And uh what are some of the ways maize

86
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.209
differs from other uh common crops?

87
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.510
Well, as I said, the wind pollination factor is

88
00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:24.829
something that farmers have to learn to control all

89
00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:28.049
the way to Monsanto. Suing farmers for the pollen

90
00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:30.470
being carried by the wind across fields in Iowa

91
00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:34.339
um or or elsewhere where the control of the

92
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.470
pollen is the key issue about how do you

93
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.070
make it commercially viable. Um But the the difference

94
00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.140
when something like wheat, wheat is wheat is self

95
00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:46.950
pollinating, it doesn't, the pollen does not move more

96
00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.489
than a few microns from different parts of the

97
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.760
plant. Rice is is self pollinating. Uh So maize

98
00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.399
dis distinctive and it is wind pollinated, not insect

99
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.320
pollinated and that makes a huge difference. But farmers

100
00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:03.700
understood this pretty quickly when any place where we

101
00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.940
see where maize has become adapted as a ma

102
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.519
a major crop, you see that farmers are adjusting

103
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.079
their own knowledge systems to the characteristics of maize.

104
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.820
Maize is hermaphrodite. It represents both genders on the

105
00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:25.200
same club, but it also is uh I guess

106
00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:30.519
morally and and unquestionably about sharing sexual engagements,

107
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.040
right? And so, I mean, we're also going to

108
00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:38.269
talk about how maize spread across the globe and

109
00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.859
specifically uh in Africa. Uh BUT what are, are

110
00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:50.049
there specific ecological conditions where maize produces high higher

111
00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:54.040
yields, where it grows, it grows and is farmed

112
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.899
the best?

113
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.899
Well, of course, that's a key characteristic. And when

114
00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:03.040
maize came from, you know, directly, for example, from,

115
00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:08.000
from the Atlantic trade with Brazil and the trade,

116
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.250
the Atlantic trade of course has is a complex

117
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.309
interaction of sugar and human labor, forced labor, you

118
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.730
know, slaves um going across and carrying maize as

119
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.559
a potential crop brought into the African case into

120
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.739
West Africa, later into Southern Africa. But also up

121
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.540
the Nile and into the Indian Ocean world where

122
00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:36.329
the word the the Kiswahili word for maize is

123
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:40.510
Muindi. It's from India. It doesn't come, didn't come

124
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:44.029
from India. But the the understanding, the popular understanding

125
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.720
of where this thing came from became the name.

126
00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.589
If we look at the name for maize in

127
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.750
different cultures, different languages. We learned a lot about

128
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.179
people's perceptions of that crop. Um In, in Malawi,

129
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.119
for example, the word the word for, for maize,

130
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.670
it means um from our ancestors, even though it

131
00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:09.989
came fairly late into place like Malawi, we replaced

132
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.540
sorghum. Sorghum is not as productive as maize and,

133
00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:18.660
and farmers at each location, whether it's tropical, subtropical

134
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.070
um or somewhat um affected by the amount of

135
00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:28.109
moisture available by rainfall by, by climate farmers adjusted

136
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:30.630
to that. So you see the varieties of maize

137
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.489
in all over the world ad adapted and again,

138
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.549
not so much like recent times by corporations who

139
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:43.429
are, who are attempting to make maize science. And

140
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.719
that's the sort of dominant the farmers made this

141
00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:49.359
choice every year when they selected their seeds, they

142
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:52.059
would, they would choose some of the, some of

143
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.979
the Mazier for seed and some for consumption. And

144
00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:58.520
the seed represented their sense of what they identified

145
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.119
is the characteristics they wanted. And that includes the

146
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:07.039
maize plant as forage, for animals. So for example,

147
00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:10.679
in Italy, the the the the the fact that

148
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.130
the farm that the peasant farmers were able to

149
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.330
use the maize plant, not just the the the

150
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.969
ear, but the plant itself to feed their cattle

151
00:09:18.979 --> 00:09:20.969
meant that they could keep the cattle in the

152
00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:23.359
barns on their farm and not send them into

153
00:09:23.369 --> 00:09:25.909
the mountains in the winter. And what they get

154
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:29.719
from that is distinctive kinds of products of the

155
00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:35.039
animals were eating the maize such as Parmesan, such

156
00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:38.289
as Gorgonzola, the cheeses, Italians, Italy is so well

157
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:41.400
known for is part of the product of maize

158
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.789
is at the core feeding of the animals. So

159
00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:46.020
they can be kept in the barns and fed

160
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.450
over the course of the winter. And thus ST

161
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.659
storing the the milk in the form of cheese.

162
00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:58.690
So it's not that uh maize uh only uh

163
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.450
I mean grows well or produces a good yield,

164
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.830
good yields in specific climates. I mean different kinds

165
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.929
of maize have been adapted to different sorts of

166
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.419
uh climates and environments. Yeah. With

167
00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:19.299
the restrictions on maize, within the constraints that farmers

168
00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:24.229
would respect would would um develop is maize is

169
00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:29.150
is vulnerable to drought moisture sensitive. So if you,

170
00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:32.090
if you have a drought prone area, either seasonally

171
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.609
or within a year, you have to realize that

172
00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:39.400
maize is vulnerable to, to moisture, to moisture uh

173
00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:44.070
availability. The other way, maize tends does not store

174
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.450
as long as other crops, millets store for a

175
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.320
very long time. Ethiopian crop tiff will, will store

176
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.500
for years. Maze, you get four months, maybe maximum

177
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.630
six months but unlikely. So you've got to eat

178
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.979
it, move it, preserve it somehow. So it has

179
00:11:02.989 --> 00:11:05.409
those constraints on maze. And so that's why you

180
00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:07.739
don't see maze as a domino c everywhere.

181
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.989
OK. Uh And when it comes, uh we've, you've

182
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.770
already mentioned some of that but when it comes

183
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.419
how and why it spread across the globe apart

184
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:25.140
from the trades you've already mentioned, were there any

185
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.460
specific, for example, political or economic reasons for it

186
00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:32.700
to become so widespread?

187
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.849
Uh uh Well, yes, one, it's, here's an example

188
00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:40.210
and this is not from the Africa work I

189
00:11:40.219 --> 00:11:42.750
did, but the work I've done in Italy where

190
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.270
the key crop for the veto. Venice was an

191
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.890
empire, an empire of trade. But they, the, the,

192
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.320
the Venetian patricians, the rich folks in Venice itself

193
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.190
told the farmers on the terra firma of who

194
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.929
they controlled that. You will pay your taxes and

195
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.359
wheat. And the farmer said wheat doesn't work well

196
00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:06.260
here in northern northern Italy, wheat works in southern

197
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.599
Italy and elsewhere. So we want to start paying

198
00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:12.700
our taxes in maize. And at first, the patricians

199
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.570
in Venice said, no, we want wheat and we

200
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.369
control you. So the battle eventually was won by

201
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.750
the peasants in the terra firma. And because of

202
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.799
the, the, the the plague and other kinds of

203
00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:27.700
situations, they won the day and were allowed to

204
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.559
pay their taxes in maize. And of course, maize

205
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.559
then becomes the basis for the diet in northern

206
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.590
Italy of polenta rather than pasta is an importation

207
00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:41.020
from Southern Italy. And the same thing happens where

208
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.159
maize is introduced in uh in Africa where fa

209
00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:49.869
farmers find it help help important to adapt maize

210
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.309
as their fundamental crop. But one of the liabilities

211
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.340
of maize is it has insufficient amino acids. So

212
00:12:58.349 --> 00:13:01.919
you have the pro from palabra is disease that

213
00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:08.440
you find especially in agricultural societies in Southern the

214
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.070
American South, in Italy and any and in southern

215
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.359
Africa, any place you have a dominance of maize

216
00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:17.239
in the diet that came as part of, of

217
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.200
maize being a really popular crop for farmers to

218
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.270
grow is Pella is a skin disease and you

219
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.989
find it places where the diet becomes too dependent

220
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.409
on maize. But you don't find that in Mid

221
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:36.419
America because in Mesoamerica, they process maize using lies

222
00:13:36.869 --> 00:13:38.799
and change the chemistry so that you get a

223
00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:41.979
complete uh amino acid and complete protein by having

224
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:44.669
a maize based diet. It has to do with

225
00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:47.559
processing. How do you process the maze? But they

226
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:52.309
didn't do that in um in other places, Italy,

227
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.820
Africa, the southern us where Pella becomes a serious

228
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.200
problem until it's understood that you have to complete

229
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.590
the proteins by, by research in the early 20th

230
00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:02.039
century.

231
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.260
And when exactly did maize get to Africa?

232
00:14:09.729 --> 00:14:12.390
Well, we don't, of course, completely know, but we

233
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.330
can look at um places early on, we begin

234
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.070
to get adaptation. For example, a na uh the

235
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.590
names given to maize you find in places in

236
00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:27.590
Nigeria or West Africa that the the words for

237
00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:32.419
maize tell us something. The the um the Akan

238
00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:36.549
in Ghana, uh the word for, for, for maize

239
00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:41.599
means something from the foreigners in Ethiopia. Then one

240
00:14:41.609 --> 00:14:44.280
of the words for a maze was Yar Maila.

241
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.640
In other words, the sor go from across the

242
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:51.909
ocean, it looks maize looks like. So, so sorghum

243
00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:55.190
or Sorghum looks like maize when it's growing early

244
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.869
on. But that the factor of people recognizing saying

245
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.169
it's the so them from across the sea. And

246
00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.479
now when you go to to the place of

247
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.679
within Ethiopia, I work, it's just called Mahila, which

248
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.349
just means Sorghum, it's not Sorghum. But people understand

249
00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:14.280
that the word tells you people's perceptions of when

250
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:18.789
this arrived. Uh So exact dates by the time

251
00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:22.429
the Portuguese arrive in Ethiopia, they're finding some maize

252
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.460
there and they tell us what they're growing. And

253
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.659
you can see the maize has already arrived. But

254
00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:31.510
we don't have a clear historical record because that's

255
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.419
something takes place in the basic level of human

256
00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:36.669
subsistence and doesn't make it into the historical sources

257
00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:38.500
quite as clearly as it does later on.

258
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.239
And how does maize tie to Africa's Green Revolution?

259
00:15:46.469 --> 00:15:51.059
Well, the Green Revolution originally was done with rice

260
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.900
for South Asia. So, so for India, South Asia

261
00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:59.140
and so that revolution was about doing short, short

262
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.419
that you have to have, you have to have

263
00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:03.630
water and you have to have fertilizer and you

264
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.070
get a huge growth in food production in South

265
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.570
Asia for Africa. The the the attempt has been

266
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.640
to say yes, maize is going to be for

267
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.539
Africa like rice was for South Asia and that's

268
00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:21.409
done by has been done by corporations by USA

269
00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:26.919
ID International Organizations. Um The key center for research

270
00:16:26.929 --> 00:16:30.919
on maize is in Mexico City when I visited

271
00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:33.599
there. Uh I was taken to uh there was

272
00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:37.200
Ethiopian there who I got, I work in Ethiopia.

273
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.030
So we became friends. He took me to a

274
00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:44.280
rural site outside of Mexico City. Uh AND they

275
00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:47.599
were growing their maize seed for which was going

276
00:16:47.609 --> 00:16:52.270
to be introduced to Ethiopia. Uh So the international

277
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.929
nature of the research going on now the Green

278
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.900
Revolution, the idea was maize can be the center

279
00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:01.619
point of that for Africa, but with the problems

280
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.790
that maze has about stability and about incomplete proteins.

281
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.910
And so what he this Ethiopian scientist was doing,

282
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:16.729
I'm developing a new variety with complete um proteins.

283
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.930
So it would have to be identified having a

284
00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.579
market value, you pay more for those seeds to

285
00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.750
have complete proteins. And this this uh type of

286
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.150
maize though was also introduced elsewhere in Africa is

287
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.829
part of what people hoped would be a green

288
00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:34.729
rev kind of green revolution. And it has done

289
00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:37.880
that the improvement in the the yield of the

290
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:43.959
maize, you improve maize is substantial to um 68

291
00:17:43.969 --> 00:17:47.520
tons per hectare compared to two tons per hectare

292
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:51.780
in local varieties. So that is Africa was has

293
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.359
been seen as the key to that in many

294
00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:59.239
ways. It is although for example, Ethiopian restaurants are

295
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.189
very popular in around the world but in in

296
00:18:02.199 --> 00:18:05.280
the US and in in Europe and you will

297
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.160
not find maize even though it's the number one

298
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.119
crop in Ethiopia, you will not find maize on

299
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.170
the diet of Ethiopia, the menu of Ethiopian restaurants

300
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.430
because it's not traditionally their ideal food, the food

301
00:18:18.439 --> 00:18:21.079
of poverty. Um YOU can buy ears of maize

302
00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:23.530
on the street, roasted maize on the street, very

303
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.410
inexpensive. But as a as a fund fundamental part

304
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.359
of diet problematic.

305
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.410
And why is it that uh when it comes

306
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.560
to Africa, people decided on maize? I mean, why

307
00:18:39.569 --> 00:18:42.569
wasn't it some other crop.

308
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.270
Well, they have, you can, you can look at

309
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.140
each individual situation. The place I work in Ethiopia,

310
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.650
they had a full maize came very late. It

311
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.790
was there as a garden crop, early yielding. It's

312
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.030
the first crop of the year. You have it

313
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.319
in your, your household garden. Um, YOU get the

314
00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:05.050
first milky stage, you can eat milky stage maize

315
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.510
or wait, wait till it dries and then process

316
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.550
it. But it's the first crop you're going to

317
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.349
get. Um But there, there they had other crops,

318
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.400
they had death in wheat and barley. And it

319
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.839
was a very, very diversified cropping system. The farmers

320
00:19:19.849 --> 00:19:23.920
understood well in other places, places in Southern Africa,

321
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.209
for example, it arrived, it replaced Sorghum because it

322
00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:30.290
was much more productive. And the African farmers all

323
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.699
over Southern Africa said this thing will give us

324
00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:35.530
a yield quickly and it is a food that

325
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.819
we can adapt into our diet. So sorghum has

326
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:42.550
almost disappeared. And maize is the crop that has

327
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.270
many different varieties in all the countries of Southern

328
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.650
Africa. All different names. Basically, it's what Americans would

329
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.189
call, call grits or Italians would call polenta. Uh

330
00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:57.209
So maze in its various forms, ref reflects the

331
00:19:57.219 --> 00:20:00.140
the choice of farmers to say this thing gives

332
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.640
an early yield. But the new varieties, the green

333
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.930
revolution varieties yield much later and you don't eat

334
00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:10.310
them at the m milky stage. At the green

335
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:12.880
stage. You have, you have to wait and dry

336
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.680
them and then process them. So it feeds into

337
00:20:15.689 --> 00:20:20.239
the industrialization of of mills that began to change

338
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.750
the way that the market affected. What kind of

339
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.349
maize farmers were growing. And the government would say,

340
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:29.349
ok, you may, may grow only this kind of

341
00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:33.130
maize because we cannot sell colored maize. B maize

342
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.229
drops out of the market because the international market

343
00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:40.880
say we want white maize. And if yellow maize

344
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.630
is grown, yellow maize is useful for poultry who

345
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.969
likes white yolks and their eggs, the yellow comes

346
00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:53.550
from the beta carotene in the yellow maize. Hm

347
00:20:53.949 --> 00:20:56.540
So you have these adaptations where the Millers are

348
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.310
saying we want this kind of maize because that's

349
00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:01.270
the one we can sell into international markets. And

350
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.589
so you have it for Africa. Virtually all of

351
00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:08.219
the African maize is white in the US, maize

352
00:21:08.229 --> 00:21:11.859
is for livestock and you want your, your the

353
00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:13.640
fat of your livestock to be kind of a

354
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.180
little bit yellow. So the the yellow maize is

355
00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:20.849
dominant in North America and in Europe too, white

356
00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:23.420
maize is still there. You can buy polenta, either

357
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.359
white or red, depending on your taste. What you're

358
00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:29.680
eating the polenta with, with, with fish or with

359
00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:32.760
uh with, with the tomato sauce, et cetera. So

360
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.199
these are consumer preferences that reflect the larger market

361
00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:40.010
preferences of the kind of maize that farmers are

362
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.239
going to be growing to produce commercially for the

363
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.640
market.

364
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.630
So uh politics and economics also certainly play a

365
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.640
big role in the adoption and spread of maize

366
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.290
across Africa.

367
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.760
Right? Yes. So if you look at a place

368
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.689
like Zimbabwe, which did fantastic research on maize development,

369
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.569
the law system eventually through the 20th century said,

370
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:10.079
OK, you may not grow maize which is not

371
00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:14.270
white. Uh BECAUSE white is the international market and

372
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.089
we're producing some of the best hybrid maize developed

373
00:22:19.099 --> 00:22:21.510
through research came out not out of the North

374
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.540
America, out of Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe.

375
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.160
Because the the, the, the maize, the scientists there,

376
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:35.050
the white, the white Rhodesian scientists developed a incredibly

377
00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.989
productive uh variety. But for that variety of, of

378
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.310
really um productive maze in terms of, of the

379
00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:47.349
of the economic perspective that you had to have

380
00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:51.109
just the right soils, just the right moisture, just

381
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:54.390
the right seasonal conditions. And of course, the white

382
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.709
population in Southern Rhodesia controlled those things. And the

383
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:02.459
the black farmers were not given access to this

384
00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:07.209
new variety. These new varieties incredibly productive is from

385
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.699
a scientific point of view, economic point of view.

386
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.780
But you also founded. This is a story I

387
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.729
got when I was doing work, work in Zimbabwe,

388
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.079
one of those scientists showed me a chart he

389
00:23:18.089 --> 00:23:21.349
made, he said, chart showed, wait a second. Why

390
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:25.849
is suddenly this this production going up? But we're

391
00:23:25.859 --> 00:23:30.150
not, we're not charting. He said in his own

392
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.670
handwriting, he wrote in this little chart from the

393
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.689
19 sixties. He showed me this chart when I

394
00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:40.699
interviewed him, he wrote African farmers. In other words,

395
00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:43.479
African farmers had found the, the, the new crop,

396
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:47.000
the new variety and were using it and adapting

397
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.040
it in their own terms. Even though the government

398
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:53.180
was trying to suppress their, their role in production

399
00:23:53.189 --> 00:23:57.780
of, of, of maize. Very, very, very political economic,

400
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.260
in a fascinating way, which is what led me

401
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.819
into and what led me into you didn't ask

402
00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:06.319
this question, but I'll answer it anyway. How did

403
00:24:06.329 --> 00:24:10.160
I begin to understand and, and want to explore

404
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.329
more of the role of maize because I grew

405
00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:14.050
up with maize fields all around me as a

406
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.329
kid. I grew up in Illinois and Illinois is

407
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:19.729
a big maize producing area. But when I was

408
00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:23.410
interviewing farmers in Ethiopia after the famine, uh there

409
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.630
was a socialist government in place that was trying

410
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.650
to control farmer activities and farmers were growing their

411
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.140
different varieties of crops. And then suddenly when I

412
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.630
said, OK, what did you go last year, the

413
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.890
year before that? It's a year before that. They

414
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.449
were saying, well, this is the maize, maize, maize,

415
00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:43.510
maize. Really? I said maize is drought is drought

416
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.760
um affected. Um IT, it it is not the

417
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.880
best nutrition in the world, it doesn't fit your

418
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:53.910
normal diet. Why are you doing this? And so

419
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.349
I began to understand it's because the government is

420
00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:59.400
saying we don't care what you grow as long

421
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.969
as you pay in these other crops. And they

422
00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:04.599
said that maize was safe because the government wouldn't

423
00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:08.290
take it from him. It was a political decision

424
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.650
that, that affected what farmers did,

425
00:25:12.569 --> 00:25:15.670
right? Uh And uh I mean, uh going along

426
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.469
the uh that line of what uh I would

427
00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:20.510
also like to ask you a little bit about

428
00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.520
the particular case of South Africa, which you have

429
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.560
done some work on. Uh YOU mentioned science there

430
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:30.719
for example. And I asked you about politics, but

431
00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:33.660
in the particular case of South Africa, uh in

432
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:39.229
what ways did politics, science and race intermingle there?

433
00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:42.989
Well, for Southern Africa, we you know the politics,

434
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.160
we know of the the arrival of Europeans in

435
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.910
the 17th century and then spread from the cape

436
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.479
into colonial settings that were originally the the arrival

437
00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:57.579
of uh Dutch later on the the the British

438
00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:02.339
Empire incorporated that but the basic population still was

439
00:26:03.209 --> 00:26:07.270
agricultural. Um And they of course had needs for

440
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.630
the mines. So the Southern African economies were about

441
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.140
gold first, sorry, diamonds first, then gold and that

442
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.239
became the diamond. So what do you need? You

443
00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.439
need labor? Mhm And when the labor is the

444
00:26:20.449 --> 00:26:25.349
black population which needs to be fed and the

445
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.819
the mine owners were having to determine what do

446
00:26:28.829 --> 00:26:32.709
we feed our mine workers to keep them healthy

447
00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:37.369
enough to work and maize became the key crop

448
00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.099
for them. Uh And the the word Milly. Milly

449
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.819
pop is a South African word for polenta or

450
00:26:44.829 --> 00:26:48.199
for the basic maize, which comes from the Portuguese

451
00:26:48.209 --> 00:26:52.390
Mili. So merely was not maize, but word came

452
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.030
to include maize from the original Portuguese. And so

453
00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.239
you have this phenomenon of the mind economy, creating

454
00:27:00.699 --> 00:27:04.010
a sense of what is what is good food.

455
00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:08.089
Um And eventually the population came to define their

456
00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:11.619
full bellies is the feeling you get when you've

457
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.280
eaten a big batch of maize. And when that

458
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.089
becomes a kind of a cultural norm of what

459
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.760
feeling full is um maize becomes that key ingredient.

460
00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:27.260
So the the miners also went back to their

461
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.339
family farms when they worked, headed out of the

462
00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:32.849
mines and they began to grow maize as down

463
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.760
the crop. And that was women doing the work

464
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.000
back home where men were the miners earning wages.

465
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.099
And therefore the the core diet became maze because

466
00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:46.469
it was low labor, lower labor. Somebody I did

467
00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:49.619
mention maze takes less labor, you can broadcast it.

468
00:27:50.489 --> 00:27:53.369
Um You don't have to do it by role,

469
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.489
et cetera. Uh So its characteristics meant it could

470
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.709
be adapted on small farms in which women's labor

471
00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.890
was the key issue. So Southern Africa, it was

472
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.569
about mining, the economy and eventually became the accepted

473
00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:13.069
um diet was maize was the core of any

474
00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:16.949
meal. Yes, there was sorghum a little bit here

475
00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.819
and there. You can still buy some Sorghum in

476
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.859
South African. Uh GRO groceries. But for the most

477
00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:28.410
part, the basic diet is maize, white maze. Mhm.

478
00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:33.459
Right. And do we know if uh maize has

479
00:28:33.469 --> 00:28:39.140
had uh any impact on the biodiversity of Africa?

480
00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:43.189
Well, in some ways, it's a negative effect because

481
00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:46.459
the farmer incentives with political context in many cases

482
00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:51.020
is maize is the crop that's really yielding. It

483
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.380
gives a very good yield for small farmers and

484
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.670
you go to, you know, 6 to 8 tons

485
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.069
per hectare of the new varieties. So farmers are

486
00:29:00.079 --> 00:29:03.140
seeking both the commercial value of that to to

487
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.939
send to the the cities but also it is

488
00:29:05.949 --> 00:29:11.160
very, very attractive is the local diet. Um So

489
00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:16.900
the biodiversity pushing maize as as USA ID does

490
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.449
with the Agra, the the this big development program

491
00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:24.619
based upon maize is the primary crop. Uh So

492
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.339
you have corporations Mon Monsanto and of course May's

493
00:29:29.349 --> 00:29:35.239
production, Monsanto is now owned by by year. So

494
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.400
the big maize producers are all owned by drug

495
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.040
companies by chemical companies. Dupont owned all of those,

496
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.479
those early developers of of maize in North America

497
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.910
in Europe are all owned by now. Chemical drug

498
00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.560
companies, Dupont Bayer um go down the line. So

499
00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:57.550
it it becomes a corporate crop and farmers are

500
00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.119
are dealing with markets and their own food supply

501
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.280
depending on where you are in Africa. Maize is

502
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.660
not the dominant crop in every part of Africa.

503
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.250
It is in, it is in southern Africa. It

504
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:14.459
is in Kenya, Tanzania. Ugali is essentially grits polenta.

505
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.060
But for, for East Africa and that's I had

506
00:30:18.069 --> 00:30:21.579
a friend, a Ugandan friend who came to Ethiopia

507
00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:24.890
and she was dying to have ugali in her

508
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.589
diet because she's from Uganda and for her food,

509
00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:33.449
met maize. At that point, Ethiopian restaurant, Ethiopian national

510
00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:37.859
diet did not really include maize for the middle

511
00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:41.000
and upper class. So, Mays has his fun role,

512
00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:45.750
role. It's not a friend of biodiversity. Mhm

513
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.540
And uh a related question, do we know what

514
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.920
impact uh the introduction of maize had on African

515
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.810
people's nutrition and health.

516
00:30:59.569 --> 00:31:03.900
Well, I mentioned pra too much dependent on maize

517
00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:06.770
but maize has its place because it yields early

518
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.479
depending on the variety you're growing. You can be

519
00:31:09.489 --> 00:31:12.400
can be the first thing that comes as the

520
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.630
first crop you have. We have often Af African

521
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.420
cultures have celebrations of the first crop. The the

522
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.689
new year begins. The first thing you can get

523
00:31:20.699 --> 00:31:23.199
is maize because you can eat it the milky

524
00:31:23.209 --> 00:31:26.359
stage as we eat with with uh we haven't

525
00:31:26.369 --> 00:31:28.300
mentioned there are five varieties of maize, one of

526
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.020
which is sweet corn, uh which is the one

527
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.369
you eat at the milky stage. It's wonderful, delicious.

528
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.900
Um Something in the fall when the first maze

529
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.949
comes in, you wanna have um sweet corn. There's

530
00:31:41.959 --> 00:31:45.619
also popcorn, also dent corn, also flint corn. These

531
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:50.510
are both flint corns which has the characters are

532
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.959
scoring longer uh which is a good thing, but

533
00:31:54.969 --> 00:31:57.050
they may take longer to mature and you're not,

534
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.959
you're not consuming them at the early stage. So

535
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.880
the the the role of maize in the diet

536
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.709
differs on which kind of cuisines you're talking about

537
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.010
which parts of Africa, Africa, of course, is a

538
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:13.829
wonderfully diverse place, linguistically, culturally, in terms of diet

539
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.410
and maize plays an important part in a number

540
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.760
of different African diets. Mhm.

541
00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:25.260
So for the second part of the interview, let's

542
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.939
say, I would like to ask you a few

543
00:32:27.949 --> 00:32:33.719
more general questions not specifically related to maize itself.

544
00:32:33.729 --> 00:32:37.479
So uh particularly when I asked you about Southern

545
00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:40.859
Africa and also earlier in the interview, you mentioned

546
00:32:40.869 --> 00:32:44.500
a little bit of it, uh we talked about

547
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.819
colonialism. So uh what would you say was the

548
00:32:48.829 --> 00:32:53.040
role played by colonialism when it comes to spreading

549
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:57.699
crops across the globe? And uh how was the

550
00:32:57.709 --> 00:33:01.939
adoption of different crops influenced by it?

551
00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:05.510
Well, it depends on the situation. We have an

552
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.569
example of Ethiopia where there was not formal colonialism.

553
00:33:09.579 --> 00:33:13.250
The Italian period was only a few years. So

554
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:17.500
the adaptation was done essentially by farmers themselves, taking

555
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.890
advantage of what is available to them in terms

556
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.020
of their own strategies of cropping across a year

557
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.849
and feeding their community with a little bit of

558
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:28.719
commercials, selling of, of grains. But also the household

559
00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:31.170
level. When you go to a place like Southern

560
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.119
Africa or or so Southern Africa, you have a

561
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:40.689
large arrival of the European population who are originally

562
00:33:40.699 --> 00:33:43.989
Dutch and then English and then some Portuguese and

563
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.890
different, different groups arrive there. Europeans who control things

564
00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:52.739
who are interested in feeding their labor and feeding

565
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.680
themselves. So you have in South Africa. So a

566
00:33:56.709 --> 00:34:02.569
wonderful um tradition now of wine because some of

567
00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:06.829
the early migrants out of Europe were Huguenots. The

568
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:09.399
huguenots were escaping France because they were oppressed by

569
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:14.370
the Cat Catholic majority there. And they began importing

570
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.000
uh vineyards and that became now today, some of

571
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.540
the best places to go and on wine tours

572
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.399
in the world. In my experience, South Africa is

573
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.590
fantastic. Um And that links to the minefields needed

574
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.938
labor. The certain minefield, the vineyards needed labor and

575
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:37.418
those laborers were eating increasingly maize getting back to

576
00:34:37.428 --> 00:34:42.648
maze but it was and some places there was

577
00:34:42.658 --> 00:34:46.500
not a European population in East Africa, Kenya a

578
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.469
little bit Tanzania. You had European populations that were

579
00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:52.590
affecting what farmers were doing because they're expected that

580
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.370
farmers would grow crops consumed by Europeans. Uh West

581
00:34:57.379 --> 00:35:00.969
Africa, the conditions of malaria, something else I work

582
00:35:00.979 --> 00:35:04.479
on malaria meant that Europeans and large populations did

583
00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:07.979
not populate West Africa, they would tend to populate

584
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:11.830
as in, in um in India hill stations that

585
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.290
were fear from malaria. So Europeans would con control

586
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.760
those spaces and so the population was allowed to

587
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.370
keep um local varieties of foodstuffs. So for example,

588
00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:28.929
in West Africa, you had the possibility of, of

589
00:35:28.939 --> 00:35:32.110
uh maize could be there as a first crop

590
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.889
if you're clearing your forest. But the, the crops

591
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.419
you really want to have in there are yam

592
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.060
cassava, another manio, another new world crop. Uh If

593
00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.800
you, you know bubble tea. Uh YES, the bubbles

594
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:52.679
are maniac. A casa. We were OK. Uh So

595
00:35:52.689 --> 00:35:56.419
you have these mixes sometimes called the Colombian exchange

596
00:35:56.429 --> 00:35:58.669
of crops coming from the old new world to

597
00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:01.550
the old world. I call it the I call

598
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.159
it not the exchange, but the circulation because the

599
00:36:05.169 --> 00:36:08.209
food crops along with peoples are circulating and bringing

600
00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:11.300
their preferred foods with them. So in West Africa,

601
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.750
you have forest crops, yams, they're, they're grown in

602
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.120
the, in the, in the, in the forest floor.

603
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.570
Uh Maize is there for the first crop but

604
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.629
then people want to get into yams and, and

605
00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:27.330
cassava and other kinds of crops taken from the

606
00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.030
forest, the biodiversity of the forest. So all that's

607
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.070
changing, of course as cities grow. But the colonial

608
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.649
effect is greatest in some places where there could

609
00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:40.120
be new neo Europe such as southern Africa, Kenya.

610
00:36:40.989 --> 00:36:44.580
But where there's factions of disease, the African population

611
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.530
had resistance to uh the Europeans would tend to

612
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.830
avoid those areas, control them for pro production of

613
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.889
food and for mining, et cetera. But uh maize

614
00:36:55.899 --> 00:37:00.300
there was, it's, it's it's interest came from farmers

615
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:04.169
themselves. But also because Europeans were happy to have

616
00:37:04.179 --> 00:37:09.320
those workers under, under colonial rule fed and the

617
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.449
maze then became a key part of that process

618
00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:14.840
of nutrition. Mhm.

619
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:21.600
So uh in historical scholarship, one approach that people

620
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:26.860
have is to look at the causal relationship between

621
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.270
climate and history. Uh What do you think of

622
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:30.510
it?

623
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.760
Climate is fundamental to history, climate about seasonality. What

624
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:41.560
is the annual cycle of, of availability of moisture?

625
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.010
Uh Disease is also sea seasonal affected by climate

626
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.489
by issues of climate. It's the thing I'm working

627
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.649
on now is sort of the more fundamental issue

628
00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:55.780
about water, water, its presence, its absence, its movement,

629
00:37:55.889 --> 00:38:00.110
it's movement through the seasons. And this is deeply

630
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:06.070
within the issue of climate change, climate change, velvet

631
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.989
of water. But of course, just look at today's

632
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.899
stuff in, in Ukraine. But what do you do

633
00:38:11.909 --> 00:38:13.530
when you want to defeat your enemy? This is

634
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.580
what the Germans did in Italy in World War

635
00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.780
Two. They said we're gonna stop the allied invasion

636
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.090
in Italy by flooding the farmers' fields because then

637
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.689
that will encourage malaria which will affect the invading

638
00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:29.229
army. In this case, the British American uh invasion

639
00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:33.070
of Italy. And that was a specific military plan,

640
00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:36.030
what's going on now, even though we're not quite

641
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.969
identifying the source of it. This is what the

642
00:38:37.979 --> 00:38:40.649
Russians are doing. They said we're going to blow

643
00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:43.050
up this dam and we're gonna flood this entire

644
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.510
area to impede the movement of, of, of military

645
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.739
activity and this gets back to the seasons in

646
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:56.469
which empires within Africa, within Ethiopia. For example, the

647
00:38:56.489 --> 00:38:59.100
the the armies moved only during the dry season.

648
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.429
If you move during the wet season, then the

649
00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:05.219
areas with malarial. Uh SO the seasonality of wind

650
00:39:05.229 --> 00:39:08.449
moisture is available is a big deal militarily in

651
00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:11.060
terms of the production of food. In terms of,

652
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.340
you know, if you, if you look at people

653
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.550
who are traveling, describing events in Africa or the

654
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.350
conditions in Africa, Europeans writing down what they're, what

655
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.030
they're encountering, they only traveled in the dry season.

656
00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:25.320
They're only giving a partial view of what they're

657
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.409
seeing because they wouldn't go during the wet season

658
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.110
because it's one, it's muddy two, it's malarial and

659
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.719
the local merchants and, and uh moving around are

660
00:39:36.729 --> 00:39:41.379
only doing their movement during that seasonality. The seasons

661
00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:45.629
change, different parts of Africa, but it's that seasonal

662
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:49.090
change and the, the issue of climate change, which

663
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.520
is now having major effects, right?

664
00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:56.229
Uh So I would like to ask you one

665
00:39:56.239 --> 00:40:00.870
last question slash topic. So, uh of course, when

666
00:40:00.879 --> 00:40:04.500
it comes to history, um I would like to

667
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.780
ask you, what do you think of approaches by

668
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:12.899
people like Jared Diamond when it comes to explaining

669
00:40:12.909 --> 00:40:17.909
why certain societies became more successful than others and

670
00:40:17.919 --> 00:40:20.870
what we could call or at least some people

671
00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:24.300
call uh geographical determinism.

672
00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:27.699
Well, that's always been a factor of how much

673
00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:31.139
is, are the conditions deterministic and Jared Diamond lays

674
00:40:31.149 --> 00:40:35.719
out an argument. That's interesting. To challenge and it's

675
00:40:35.729 --> 00:40:38.340
good that it's there. And it's, it's, it's an

676
00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:44.209
attempt at universal explanation of human movement, human political

677
00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:48.510
economic domination based around on environmental issues to some

678
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.270
degree. That's true. Um And I think that that

679
00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:57.050
any consideration of politics or of economic change or

680
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.000
of interaction between different kinds of political systems um

681
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.489
has its foundations, environmental issue in environmental issues. The

682
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.939
fact that Europeans coming to Africa or even to

683
00:41:07.949 --> 00:41:11.429
North America or to, to the new world. It's

684
00:41:11.439 --> 00:41:14.209
about the movement of knowledge. Part of that Colombian

685
00:41:14.219 --> 00:41:19.120
circulation I mentioned was the arrival in Latin America

686
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:24.050
of people who knew how to deal with couple

687
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.830
of climates. The people, the the the selection of

688
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.659
who is that most valued as labor out of

689
00:41:32.669 --> 00:41:36.000
the slave trade, going to the to the Carolinas

690
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.739
in the US because the ones who are most

691
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.780
valued came from Santa Gambia. They knew how to

692
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.739
grow rice and the the plantation owners. And so

693
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.939
in, in um in the Carolinas were stayed in

694
00:41:48.949 --> 00:41:52.320
their, their uplands and in areas that were not

695
00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.699
so much so affected by malaria or other diseases

696
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.560
and their, their African slaves were allowed to move

697
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.040
into swampy areas because they knew how to grow.

698
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.350
Um LOVE rima rice. They were adapting the environment,

699
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.189
they knew, they knew how to deal with health,

700
00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:12.550
knew how to deal with production. And so the

701
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.060
knowledge that moved into the new world also was

702
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.139
a key part of this whole exchange and politics

703
00:42:20.149 --> 00:42:24.459
got into who controlled who but also adaptation to

704
00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:29.090
environmental issues. If you want to understand the geography

705
00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.350
of Ethiopia is a, is a place that's a

706
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.540
place I work. Most, you know, look at climate

707
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.419
seasonality and you see that people would move in

708
00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:41.659
and out of areas that were affected by malaria

709
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.939
or where they could grow one crop or another

710
00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:46.219
crop and then harvest it and get back to

711
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:49.879
a safer area. Big factor and you a diamond

712
00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:55.850
is helpful to have that, that um that perspective

713
00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.850
that is environmental determinism, but they will have nuance

714
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.699
by local areas. And that's the beautiful part of

715
00:43:02.709 --> 00:43:04.760
doing the, doing the work and working with different

716
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:05.760
people in different places.

717
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:09.270
Mhm. So, yeah. Uh I mean, I've also asked

718
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.090
you about that because of course, a big part

719
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.760
of Jared Diamond's argument is based on uh crops

720
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.449
also, of course domesticated animals in certain specific latitudes

721
00:43:21.879 --> 00:43:25.725
in the world. Uh And uh since of course,

722
00:43:25.735 --> 00:43:29.024
our interview has been focused so much on maize

723
00:43:29.034 --> 00:43:32.155
and we touched on some other crops as well.

724
00:43:32.165 --> 00:43:36.564
Uh I was wondering, I mean, to what extent

725
00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:42.245
you would think um the factors that Jared Diamond

726
00:43:42.254 --> 00:43:45.645
points to uh I, I mean, what uh how

727
00:43:45.655 --> 00:43:48.725
much of a role do you think they would

728
00:43:48.735 --> 00:43:51.445
play in human history?

729
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.199
Well, I would add to Jared Diamond as, as

730
00:43:55.209 --> 00:43:59.260
a um kind of marker of environmental determinism with

731
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:03.719
a reasonable coherent and somewhat persuasive argument. But look

732
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:07.080
at Alfred Crosby who coined the term the Columbian

733
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.959
exchange that I modified to publicly of the interaction.

734
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:17.760
Um It is is that uh Alfred Crosby talks

735
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:22.750
about the the biological imperialism because the the arrival

736
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.040
in the new world of cattle and pigs, right?

737
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.149
And chickens and part of this global circulation transforms

738
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:36.260
the the physical environment. When you release hogs into

739
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.330
the environment, they are extremely good at going feral

740
00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:42.870
and they, they, they change the physical world they

741
00:44:42.879 --> 00:44:45.459
live in and humans are both either hunting them

742
00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:50.229
or trying to domesticate them or the the animals

743
00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:52.189
and the plants, of course, maize being a big

744
00:44:52.199 --> 00:44:55.739
one of globalization, but this is also true of

745
00:44:55.750 --> 00:45:00.159
other, other crops and other kinds of animals. Um

746
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:05.270
YOU know, goats, sheep, cattle, horses, all of these

747
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.879
things that transform the worlds they they move to

748
00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:12.850
and the adaptation of local populations quickly to the

749
00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.790
horse. For example, you know, native Americans in North

750
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.030
America adaptations of the horse, suddenly they become mobile,

751
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.149
suddenly they, they're able to hunt in different ways.

752
00:45:23.159 --> 00:45:26.129
Suddenly they're able to, to to expand their own

753
00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:31.090
local local control over different com competing groups in

754
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.860
new, in new ways. So the the Alfred Crosby

755
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:37.489
approach to this, which has been adapted by people,

756
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.489
scholars from, from all over the world are incorporating

757
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.540
these ideas and and playing them out in local

758
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.120
areas that makes sense for them. But Jared Diamond

759
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:50.290
more popular is, is something to read. Uh It's

760
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.709
kind of New York Times best seller list. But

761
00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:56.439
the Alfred Crosby stuff is also uh to me

762
00:45:56.449 --> 00:46:00.669
uh very good. And the colleagues I work with

763
00:46:00.679 --> 00:46:04.669
who are specialists when I, when I go someplace,

764
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:07.290
it's not that I know things others don't know.

765
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.330
But I absorb as his historian, I'm absorbing the

766
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.879
knowledge and interacting with my colleagues, whether it's in

767
00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:16.270
Ghana, we were talking about the introduction of maize

768
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.189
or in Ethiopia where we're driving through the countryside

769
00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:21.629
and I'm saying, what's going on there? We're walking

770
00:46:21.639 --> 00:46:24.379
through the countryside. And I'm always asking questions because

771
00:46:24.389 --> 00:46:26.570
they have the knowledge that I've been trying to

772
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.770
interpret for a larger uh audience as an academic,

773
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.959
as a historian. So these things are very, very

774
00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:36.770
global, it helps to have people kind of tweaking

775
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.889
the narrative by publishing books like Jared Diamond. But

776
00:46:40.899 --> 00:46:42.149
it's not that we say gee he's got it.

777
00:46:42.159 --> 00:46:45.239
Right. Um He's after all, you know, his original

778
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:52.790
background, he's a gastroenterologist. Mhm. Right. And we trust

779
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.159
doctors to a degree. Yes.

780
00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:00.429
Yeah. Right. So uh Doctor mccann, uh I'm leaving

781
00:47:00.439 --> 00:47:03.540
a link to your book Maze And Grace, a

782
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.600
History of Africa's encounter with the new World Cup

783
00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.040
crop in the description box of the interview. Uh

784
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.439
Would you like to mention any places on the

785
00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:16.000
internet where people can find your work?

786
00:47:17.449 --> 00:47:19.000
Well, I think the internet being what it is,

787
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.360
you can, you can do that. Um What I'm

788
00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.260
getting now, I just was at Oxford University Press

789
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.840
asked me to write a chapter on malaria in

790
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:32.040
Africa. And malaria in Africa came from my own

791
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.959
work with, again, with colleagues um who work on

792
00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:39.399
malaria in Africa and elsewhere. But um people I

793
00:47:39.409 --> 00:47:41.239
got malaria when I was doing field work in

794
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:44.479
Africa uh in, in Ethiopia, you know, an area

795
00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:47.260
where the maize stuff was going on. And I

796
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.719
didn't ask go malaria. But suddenly I had 100

797
00:47:49.729 --> 00:47:52.939
and five degree fever and had to go back

798
00:47:52.949 --> 00:47:55.979
out of my my rural area five hours by

799
00:47:55.989 --> 00:47:59.199
mule to get to the nearest road to the

800
00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:02.600
nearest light bulb. Oh my God. And so malaria

801
00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.820
became an interest and the maze. Malaria connection is

802
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:10.449
one chapter of of um maize and grace. And

803
00:48:10.459 --> 00:48:13.629
so male malaria is where I I appear on

804
00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:15.909
the internet. I'm constantly getting notes saying you've been

805
00:48:15.919 --> 00:48:20.760
cited by these 100 times. I said really I'm

806
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.139
not doing and it's, it's mainly now about the

807
00:48:23.149 --> 00:48:26.409
medical malaria stuff that links to the maze. All

808
00:48:26.419 --> 00:48:30.129
these things are linked. Um And now back to

809
00:48:30.139 --> 00:48:32.959
the North Fundament of water in which I'm doing

810
00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:36.870
a plenary panel for a international meeting in Finland

811
00:48:37.149 --> 00:48:40.649
next year. And that is to draw people together

812
00:48:40.659 --> 00:48:44.459
around what is the meaning of water? Meanings of

813
00:48:44.469 --> 00:48:49.459
water as something physical is something psychological is something

814
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.909
cultural and water takes us to all kinds of

815
00:48:52.919 --> 00:48:56.379
ways that people signify their sainthood if they're in

816
00:48:56.389 --> 00:49:01.100
a, in a, uh religious religious setting. Um, AND

817
00:49:01.129 --> 00:49:04.260
for example, in the 88, the 18 fifties, this

818
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.530
short story, the British traveler in Ethiopia came down

819
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:12.560
with fever and it's called eu, he understood this

820
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.959
as I have a fever. What do I do?

821
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.010
He's riding around the countryside with people and they

822
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.679
said, what you need to do is stand in

823
00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.399
this tree and we're gonna dump water on your

824
00:49:20.409 --> 00:49:23.219
head and this will deal with your fever. He

825
00:49:23.229 --> 00:49:24.850
said, well, first of all, it knocked him off,

826
00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.530
his horse, knocked him senseless and he felt slightly

827
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.060
better at the end of this ordeal. At the

828
00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:34.699
same time, there's someone in Malvern England who's going

829
00:49:34.709 --> 00:49:38.949
through a water therapy treatment, somewhat, somewhat similar and

830
00:49:38.959 --> 00:49:43.580
that person was Charles Darwin. So water is this,

831
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:47.340
this, this universal, of course, it's universal, but the

832
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:52.179
nuances and local cultures and local material versus belief

833
00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:55.090
systems is the thing that I'm working on now.

834
00:49:55.179 --> 00:49:57.909
And you find examples of that all over the

835
00:49:57.919 --> 00:50:01.199
world where suddenly cli that links to climate change.

836
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:07.219
Very interesting. So, Doctor mccann, uh thank you so

837
00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:09.620
much for taking the time to come on the

838
00:50:09.629 --> 00:50:12.149
show. It's been a real pleasure to talk to

839
00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:12.389
you

840
00:50:12.899 --> 00:50:17.100
too. Say no or the equivalent of the Italian.

841
00:50:17.469 --> 00:50:20.350
Yeah. In this case, uh it would be bo

842
00:50:20.919 --> 00:50:24.580
part here. It's still the afternoons. OK?

843
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.969
Time change, time change. So thank you very much

844
00:50:27.979 --> 00:50:31.570
Ricardo. Very interesting. You're, you're uh you're a good,

845
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.689
