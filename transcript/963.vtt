00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.829
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.500
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lob. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.880
joined by Doctor Abraham Newman. He's professor at the

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.470
School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown

5
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.680
University. And today we're talking about his latest book

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.819
written together with a referral underground empire. How America

7
00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.120
weaponize the world economy. So Dr Newman, welcome to

8
00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:27.790
the show. It's a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.840
Thank you so much for having me.

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.950
So let me start perhaps with this question before

11
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:37.310
we get into details here. Why is it that

12
00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:42.029
you call America an empire? What kind of empire

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.709
are we talking about here? Exactly.

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.400
Sure. So, um you know what we're trying to

15
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.750
get at is that uh America's power is not

16
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:57.750
just located in the traditional forms that we think

17
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.459
about which are often military or national power. Um

18
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.389
BUT it extends beyond its border and the way

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.379
that it extends are through these basic infrastructures of

20
00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:15.650
uh capitalism. So things that people for decades really

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.720
hadn't focused on uh whether it's the dollar clearing

22
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.250
system, uh internet cables, um the way that uh

23
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.980
platform companies organize the globe, what we're trying to

24
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.529
use the the empire metaphor is to say, we

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.540
really need to think about us power, not just

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.449
as like state to state nations, but that it

27
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.500
extends through these from the core to the periphery,

28
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.089
through these economic networks. And that the US um

29
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:43.930
gets really remarkable power from it.

30
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.440
And, and so before we get into some of

31
00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:52.569
the main kinds of technologies and services that uh

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.760
according to you played the role in the rise

33
00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:59.199
of this new kind of empire. How far back

34
00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.639
in history would you say we need to go

35
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.680
to really identify the foundations of this empire?

36
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.169
Sure. So, I mean, um the main focus of

37
00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.690
the book is uh the Networks that evolved after

38
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.729
um you know, the Bretton Woods period. So, you

39
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.729
know, there's a up and through the 19 seventies,

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.729
economies are still mostly national. So you have national

41
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.949
banking systems, you have na you know, you have

42
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.789
ministries for telecommunications and telegraph if anybody remembers those.

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.473
Um And so then starting in the 19 seventies,

44
00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:42.022
eighties, those things get loosened. We end capital controls,

45
00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.533
companies get privatized. You have the whole wave of

46
00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:48.863
liberalization, all of those things lead to the formation

47
00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:54.483
of world spanning networks for finance, for production and

48
00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.503
for information. And that accelerates in the 19 nineties.

49
00:02:58.595 --> 00:02:59.985
And then with the, with the end of the

50
00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.565
Cold War uh that they move from just being

51
00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:05.455
western networks to global networks. And of course, the

52
00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:08.205
the technological revolution of the internet, you know, it

53
00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:12.406
really supercharges these things. Um And so, you know,

54
00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:13.785
if you were going to kind of think about,

55
00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:16.865
when did these networks start getting created? It's, it's

56
00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:19.805
in those the 19 eighties, 19 nineties. Um BUT

57
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:21.895
they really accelerate in the two thousands.

58
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.089
So let's talk about some of these services and

59
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.100
technologies then how did the banking system evolve until

60
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.690
it became actually global?

61
00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.089
Sure. So, you know, after world war two, many

62
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.320
of the Western countries, European countries, they don't have

63
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.520
functioning capital markets and most of the capital reserves

64
00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.699
are in the United States. And so you start

65
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.190
to have uh you know, things like the Marshall

66
00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.330
plan and the trade kind of the trade system,

67
00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:59.669
it's relying on uh us reserves dollars to do

68
00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.889
it and those dollars then to start to leak

69
00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.110
out into the global system. And people take on

70
00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.479
the dollar as this kind of uh medium of

71
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.550
exchange ways to do business. And so what, what

72
00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.949
we talk about one of these um networks that

73
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.510
becomes very important for us power today is the

74
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.923
dollar clearing system. And it's a very, it's kind

75
00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:23.744
of complicated thing, but it basically means if uh

76
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:26.774
a Japanese company and a German company, if they

77
00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:29.695
do a sale with each other, they often do

78
00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:32.595
that in dollars uh because it's easier than exchanging

79
00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.239
euros for Yen. And um and so the way

80
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.369
that happens is that the, those companies have accounts

81
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.459
in what are called correspondent banks. Uh THEY'RE often

82
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.339
American banks and it's like a ledger and that

83
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.190
bank changes in the ledger, you know, there was

84
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.204
a sale from the German to the Japanese. Uh

85
00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:54.024
AND it goes through that Correspondent Bank and that

86
00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:56.964
means that the US through that system has a

87
00:04:56.975 --> 00:05:00.674
lot of legal authority, not just over us banks,

88
00:05:00.684 --> 00:05:03.665
but all those firms that are using the dollar

89
00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:04.484
clearing system.

90
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.970
But is uh this happens in virtue of the

91
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.010
fact of transactions being made in dollars or is

92
00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:18.920
it that America has some more direct influence over

93
00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:21.679
the banking system in some other ways?

94
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.390
No, I mean, our story is often um you

95
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:29.440
know, the US government is not, it's not planning

96
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.950
this, it's not, doesn't realize what's happened. Um You

97
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.470
know, we have a chapter that's really focused on

98
00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:38.820
the uh you know, we'll call them the, the

99
00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:42.269
heroes of globalization. Uh THE people who thought they

100
00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.320
were gonna create a world without governments, you know,

101
00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:48.200
with beyond governments. Um And what they ended up

102
00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:51.875
doing was create these economic networks that were global.

103
00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:56.154
Um But they often concentrated their interactions in these

104
00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:59.894
very large firms. Uh LIKE we focus on city,

105
00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:02.095
for example, as one of those stories that we

106
00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:05.355
tell and um the heads of that bank, they,

107
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.554
you know, they really thought they were beyond sovereignty,

108
00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.114
beyond a nation, they were like pirates going out

109
00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.630
creating this ocean of capitalism. Um But then they

110
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.470
refocused all of that power just in one company

111
00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.160
and that's where the US government starts to realize,

112
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.630
well, if we don't need to control the world

113
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.640
or go, you know, to, to focus on every

114
00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:27.899
company, we can just go at these core choke

115
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.609
point companies in the economy. Me who have so

116
00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.910
much information and have become so vital uh to

117
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.959
interactions. Um And so we tell that story, Walter

118
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.410
Riston was the character that we tell about city.

119
00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.950
But you can replay that with Amazon cloud services

120
00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:46.910
or TS MC and the semiconductor production system. Um

121
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.239
IT kind of, you know, these networks that we

122
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.070
thought were so complicated and decentralized, rec centralized into

123
00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:56.869
these few um or firms

124
00:06:57.609 --> 00:07:01.170
that's very interesting. But even if it's, I if

125
00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.149
it was not something that the US government or

126
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:12.109
any other institution planned beforehand right now, is this

127
00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:16.130
something that people in the US government and other

128
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.799
government related institutions uh are aware of that they

129
00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:26.390
have this sort of influence over the global banking

130
00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.910
system?

131
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.899
Yes, I mean, so it uh in the book,

132
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.700
we really locate that as happening in response to

133
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.619
the 911 terrorist attack in the United States uh

134
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.809
where, you know, agencies across the US government were

135
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.820
tasked with kind of figuring out how could they

136
00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.429
respond to this really unprecedented thing that they weren't

137
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.959
prepared for. Uh And what you see is agency

138
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.859
after agency that, that didn't maybe traditionally have the

139
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.720
type of role, discovers these maps and these networks

140
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.510
and realizes that um that they offer them an

141
00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:08.019
opportunity to respond to this problem. And you know,

142
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.899
Treasury, which is primarily responsible for this domain. The

143
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.160
US Treasury Department, its core mission for decades was

144
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.779
to open markets, to liberalize, to not have government

145
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.700
control. Um AND it, it, but it is, it

146
00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:25.820
has to respond to this crisis. And you see

147
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.670
a group in treasury realize how these networks, the,

148
00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:32.049
the the com the um correspondent banking network, the

149
00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:34.562
dollar clearing, which I just described. Um BUT also

150
00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:37.322
the swift system uh which is uh uh we

151
00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:38.841
can talk more about what that is, but it's

152
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.291
a kind of a encrypted post office for banks

153
00:08:42.432 --> 00:08:46.122
that also provided a similar um uh entry point

154
00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:49.312
into these powers. Um But at least the story

155
00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:51.231
that we want to tell is that it's not

156
00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:54.521
one where these, these bureaucrats have been planning all

157
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.455
the law and then the trap is, you know,

158
00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:59.916
set it really, they're, they're in the cloud or

159
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:04.786
sorry, the fog of uh wicked problems and they're

160
00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:07.815
struggling to figure out how to respond and they,

161
00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.685
they see these opportunities and, and, and for us,

162
00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:12.435
that's one of the reasons why we think there

163
00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:14.716
needs to be more attention to this because it

164
00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:19.116
um it, that kind of crisis response can lead

165
00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.986
to the use of these powers in not maybe

166
00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.866
the best planned ways.

167
00:09:24.969 --> 00:09:28.530
Uh So we'll get into the US government response

168
00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:32.469
to 911 in a second. But tell us a

169
00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:35.840
little bit more about the swift system that you

170
00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:39.979
mentioned there in banking. So why is it important

171
00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:42.469
in this uh story, let's say

172
00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:48.700
sure. So, um the basically, you know, banks have

173
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.940
to know uh who is supposed to give which

174
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.200
money to whom and how are they going to

175
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.619
do that in an organized way. And up until

176
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.020
the 19 seventies, they had a lot of just

177
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.229
bilateral interactions. There were a lot of, you know,

178
00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:03.359
it's like I'll call you, I made this and

179
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:07.369
it was very complicated and as global banking increased,

180
00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:10.359
um then there was this effort to rationalize that

181
00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:13.679
to create some kind of centralized clearing house to

182
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.359
let people know um who sh where money should

183
00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:20.729
be sent. And so then this cooper was created

184
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.719
um that's called Swift. It sits in Belgium and

185
00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:27.859
it is a collective of global banks and it's

186
00:10:27.869 --> 00:10:31.559
like a encrypted uh post office for uh the

187
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.260
banking system. They don't change. They, they're not responsible

188
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.539
for the actual money, but just the information about

189
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:41.000
which money should be transferred to whom. And uh

190
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.400
any transaction that goes over $10,000 in the world

191
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.039
is gonna go through the Swift system. And so

192
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:51.700
they have an incredible amount of information about financial

193
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.719
transactions and they also are really vital if you

194
00:10:54.729 --> 00:10:57.729
want to be a global bank, you need access

195
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.400
to this information network.

196
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.299
A and so when it comes to the story

197
00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:07.270
you are presenting in your book, uh does the

198
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.340
US also have some sort of access to that

199
00:11:11.349 --> 00:11:15.119
information that passes through the Swift system?

200
00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:21.719
So um after 911, 2 things happen is first

201
00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:25.830
the United States, uh they um create a subpoena

202
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.640
system to uh ask for the data that Swift

203
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.960
has uh regarding different terrorists or uh cells that

204
00:11:33.969 --> 00:11:37.289
the US government is interested in. Um And that

205
00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:41.179
is facilitated in part by the fact that Swift

206
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.849
mirrored their data in Virginia in a, in a

207
00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:47.760
data center in the United States. Um And so

208
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.429
at the original Swift uh access was in part

209
00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.159
um a product of the, the location of the

210
00:11:56.169 --> 00:12:01.020
data and how it's spread internationally. Um But then

211
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.869
uh ultimately, the, the European Union and the United

212
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.539
States, they sign an agreement uh that's called the

213
00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:10.859
Swift agreement which allows the United States uh to

214
00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:14.140
ask Swift for data for these purposes. And so

215
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.859
it, it institutionalizes this process and there's an important

216
00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:20.190
part of that agreement which then allows European government

217
00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:25.450
to basically recycle that data because Europe, because of

218
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.460
data privacy rules is often limited in what information

219
00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:31.049
it can ask. Swift. And so, you know, the

220
00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:33.340
US can ask Swift and then Europe can ask

221
00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:35.690
the United States. Uh So it's kind of like

222
00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.619
a, you know, a back door into that uh

223
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.890
intelligence um uh information.

224
00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:46.780
And what is the role that the internet plays

225
00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:49.099
in all of this? I mean, I would imagine

226
00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:53.099
that of course, originally the internet was not developed

227
00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:58.679
uh planning for this kind of uh control or

228
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.950
this kind of influence that the US now has

229
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.039
on uh global economy and so forth. Right? So

230
00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:09.820
uh what role the uh uh uh ba basically

231
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.080
tell us first perhaps how the internet was developed

232
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.570
and then implemented and the role that it plays

233
00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:21.109
uh in this uh story that you present in

234
00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:21.640
the book.

235
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.650
Sure. So, um you know, the original concept of

236
00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:29.119
the um the internet was it was based on

237
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.669
a decentralized structure that was intended to knit together

238
00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:36.450
different networks. And that's why it's called the internet

239
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.070
was that there were these multiple networks um that

240
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.390
were based around universities largely and then also uh

241
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.849
nuclear scientists. Uh AND they were, they each had

242
00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:49.224
their own um internal networks and they wanted to,

243
00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:52.385
to uh communicate with each other. And so the,

244
00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:55.364
the protocols that were created to run the internet

245
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.905
were often based on the assumption that the system

246
00:13:58.914 --> 00:14:01.724
would be decentralized and that there wouldn't be a

247
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:05.104
kind of a, a central uh access point or,

248
00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:08.885
or points of control. Um But we've evolved from

249
00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:14.599
that to place where um the core infrastructures of

250
00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:18.429
the internet are now quite centralized. So if you

251
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.359
look at your phone, you know, it's, it's either

252
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:24.450
being operated by Apple or Google. It's on a

253
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.780
chip that's made by Samsung or TS MC. And

254
00:14:27.789 --> 00:14:30.090
if you make a financial transaction on your phone,

255
00:14:30.229 --> 00:14:33.150
it's run through, you know, you know, paypal Visa

256
00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:36.575
or maybe one of 10 very large banks. Um

257
00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:40.744
And so that even though the, the idea was

258
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:45.455
decentralized, originally, the architecture that we have evolved into

259
00:14:45.674 --> 00:14:49.844
is highly focused on these firms that are monetizing

260
00:14:50.034 --> 00:14:53.085
the internet. Um And then there's also in addition

261
00:14:53.094 --> 00:14:55.815
to that, those sometimes people call them platform uh

262
00:14:55.825 --> 00:15:00.520
companies, there's also the the the infrastructure has also

263
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.099
re centralized. So uh where we used to have

264
00:15:04.109 --> 00:15:07.320
laptops, where all our data was stored on the

265
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.989
laptop, we now often rely on what's called the

266
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.239
cloud. Um But as we describe in the book,

267
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.169
the cloud is not actually in the cloud, it's

268
00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:19.080
mostly really close to Washington DC in a town

269
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.330
called Ashburn, Virginia where there are just miles and

270
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.880
miles of data centers. Um And that physical concentration

271
00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:31.729
of um of data, it has also re centralized

272
00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:32.880
these these systems.

273
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.229
And I would imagine that in the case of

274
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.099
the internet, it's not only the fact that over

275
00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:43.719
time it became more centralized, but also, I mean,

276
00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:49.320
since the internet is virtually everywhere, now, it's also

277
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.859
the huge amount of information that people or government

278
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.760
institutions and so on can gather through the internet,

279
00:15:59.289 --> 00:16:01.309
right? That's also true that just more and more

280
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.469
people are on it. And more information is being

281
00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:04.270
generated.

282
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.510
Mhm. Uh So, and, and just to go back

283
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.840
to one of the points you made there about

284
00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:13.440
the internet, it was then or original originally at

285
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.869
least supposed to be an open network. Correct.

286
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.890
Yes, it's still, I mean, it's still an open

287
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:26.669
network. I think that um so the, the main

288
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.030
difference is is that, so one of the questions

289
00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:36.270
is openness. Can anybody join this network? And today

290
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.190
in the internet, at least the way we have

291
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.869
it right now, it's still largely an open network.

292
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.250
There are some countries that uh um limit access

293
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.640
or, you know, toggle uh internet, the internet on

294
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.770
and off. Um But in general, the protocols allow

295
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.369
anybody to join and to build onto um the

296
00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:01.130
system. Uh But the economic environment, the ecosystem that

297
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.040
has uh evolved, concentrates activity through these, it funnels

298
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:11.939
the information through these uh large concentrated companies. And

299
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:16.229
the the infrastructure also funnels the data through the

300
00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:20.790
physical locations like the um the the data center

301
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.310
hubs.

302
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.170
So let's go back to 911. Then you, you've

303
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.729
already mentioned a few things about what happened after

304
00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:33.290
the response to it. But let's get back to

305
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.969
the beginning. So what happened immediately in the aftermath

306
00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:43.170
of 911? And what were the original intentions of

307
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.050
the US government?

308
00:17:46.329 --> 00:17:49.910
Yes. So I think um you know, in that

309
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.290
moment, these bureaucracies are really scrambling and they're trying

310
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.750
to figure out how can they bring their own

311
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.479
resources to bear on this, um very uh tragic

312
00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:06.390
and very uh important problem that the United States

313
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.780
faces. Uh AND what they, you know, whether it's

314
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.430
the Treasury or the NSA uh or other uh

315
00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:17.900
parts of the US government, they identify these economic

316
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.430
networks which, you know, really had grown in the

317
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.359
period before 911, in the 19 nineties. Uh And

318
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.209
so many of these agencies, they were not, they,

319
00:18:27.219 --> 00:18:29.079
they had not been using these for decades and

320
00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:31.489
decades, but these were kind of new facts on

321
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.310
the ground and they were putting the drawing the,

322
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:37.310
the, the lines together. And what you see is

323
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:40.670
that from Treasury to the NSA, they, they see

324
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.650
these maps and then they start to think about

325
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.709
two things. Uh ONE, how can they use them

326
00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:50.989
to surveil uh and get information about these uh

327
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.550
terrorist networks. And then the second is how can

328
00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.599
they um uh eliminate access for these networks to

329
00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:04.500
uh bad actors? Uh And so, uh you get

330
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.079
a set of new laws under the US government,

331
00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:09.880
the Patriot Act, there's a bunch of new rules

332
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.520
about financial um uh uh tracking and sanctions and

333
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.099
those acts give the United States government new authority

334
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.800
to then do these things to monitor and then

335
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.050
also to um to, to, to choke off access

336
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.719
from these networks and, and many of those um

337
00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:33.349
uh tactics that were then developed under 911, they

338
00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:37.640
then get used against um AAA host of, of

339
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.550
other problems that arise. So the next one that

340
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.359
comes up is uh nonproliferation and North Korea, a

341
00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:47.670
similar set of issues with Iran. Uh And you

342
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.094
see where the swift system been used to monitor

343
00:19:51.104 --> 00:19:54.665
terrorists in the post 911 period, it then becomes

344
00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:58.895
used to cut off access to Iranian banks in

345
00:19:58.905 --> 00:20:02.334
the run up to negotiations with Iran over its

346
00:20:02.344 --> 00:20:05.844
nuclear program. And so the legacies of those moments

347
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:09.675
after 911 are really still with us today.

348
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.400
A and so would you say that the at

349
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:18.589
least the original intentions were good or not?

350
00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.910
Um Yes, I mean, I think that the original

351
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.239
tensions uh were good. And II, I think um

352
00:20:26.689 --> 00:20:30.349
our book is not really trying to say that

353
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:34.069
the United States um is evil or it's bad.

354
00:20:34.089 --> 00:20:35.819
You know, what we really want to just say

355
00:20:35.829 --> 00:20:39.709
is this, it's, we often use the, the image

356
00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:42.170
of like a superhero, like there's a superhero that

357
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.489
gets these new powers and it's amazing what it

358
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.890
can do with those powers. And there's that moment

359
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.719
where there can be hubris, where the powers can

360
00:20:51.729 --> 00:20:55.439
become overwhelming and they can be used uh without

361
00:20:55.449 --> 00:20:58.939
fully thinking through, you know, what are the consequences

362
00:20:58.949 --> 00:21:01.209
of using these powers. And so the point of

363
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:03.160
our book is not to say that the US

364
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.939
is bad or it um is always making mistakes

365
00:21:05.949 --> 00:21:09.099
is just that um there's a risk if there's

366
00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:12.859
no framework. If there's no architecture to put over

367
00:21:12.869 --> 00:21:15.739
how these powers are used, it could spiral out

368
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.430
of control. Uh And that's really the, the goal

369
00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:21.180
is to say, we don't think you can put

370
00:21:21.189 --> 00:21:23.189
these, you're never gonna put these back in a

371
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.619
box. You know, it's like you can't get rid

372
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.979
of this. The world is riddled with these choke

373
00:21:27.989 --> 00:21:30.579
points that can be manipulated. Um And so we

374
00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.550
need a, we need to make everybody aware of

375
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.819
that. And then think through how do we create

376
00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:39.949
a strategy, a system and architecture uh that leads

377
00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:42.760
to their use for good. Um WHICH I think

378
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.589
the original uses were for good. You know, they

379
00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:47.189
were trying to protect the United States from terrorist

380
00:21:47.199 --> 00:21:50.489
attacks. And um that really was uh I think

381
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.599
a noble cause.

382
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.890
Uh BUT when it comes to the original goals

383
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.530
that the US government had to fight back against

384
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.300
terrorism in the aftermath of 911, were those goals

385
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.219
uh met or not?

386
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.680
I mean, I think, I think primarily they were

387
00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:16.380
met the um the uh use of those tools,

388
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.790
at least, you know, I'm not a terrorist expert.

389
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.040
So I, you know, I there's a bigger debate

390
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.119
about that but I think the Al Qaeda financial

391
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.839
network was severely dismantled and hampered uh because of

392
00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:33.219
these efforts. Um And so I think it was,

393
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.339
it wasn't the sole reason uh why the United

394
00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:41.359
States was able to um you know, minimize the

395
00:22:41.369 --> 00:22:43.300
threat from Al Qaeda but it was an important

396
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.300
component in it.

397
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:49.619
Mhm So uh when it comes to these global

398
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.239
networks that we've been talking about and uh the

399
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:57.449
global economy more generally, uh in the book, you

400
00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:01.599
also talk about how uh the US can make

401
00:23:01.609 --> 00:23:06.199
use of these global networks to, for example, cut

402
00:23:06.209 --> 00:23:09.839
entire countries out of the global economy. So could

403
00:23:09.849 --> 00:23:11.880
you tell us a little bit about that and

404
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.880
perhaps give us an example?

405
00:23:14.949 --> 00:23:18.250
Sure. So um I mean, I think the uh

406
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.250
the clearest example that we discussed in, well, I

407
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.010
think there's two powerful examples. The first is the

408
00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.800
Iran sanctions um that were put in place both

409
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.630
in the run up to the nuclear negotiations. Um

410
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.890
And then also the um they, they snapped back

411
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.400
into place under the Trump administration. And so that

412
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.099
I think it's, it's a a powerful example where

413
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.420
the United States and in part with its allies

414
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.760
in Europe, uh use these tools in order to

415
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:56.680
really constrain Iran's economic um activity. The more recent

416
00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:59.880
example is if uh is the US and European

417
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:06.189
efforts to um limit Russia's economic capacity. Uh I

418
00:24:06.199 --> 00:24:10.060
think the the clearest example was when E Europe

419
00:24:10.069 --> 00:24:13.359
and the United States together froze the um add

420
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:16.280
the foreign assets of the Russian Central Bank. So

421
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.910
there were about $300 billion worth of assets um

422
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.479
that they were uh they froze together. Um And

423
00:24:23.489 --> 00:24:26.790
they're both pretty remarkable actions, you know, uh when

424
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.890
you think about neither, in neither case, were there

425
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.170
any boots on the ground or, you know, military

426
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.040
activity? But they were able to have quite significant

427
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.060
um economic consequences.

428
00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:42.900
And uh I mean, looking at the broader global

429
00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:47.209
picture in terms of the several the other big

430
00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:51.790
countries out there, is there anyone apart from the

431
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.329
US that can also have a, in an influence

432
00:24:56.339 --> 00:25:00.859
over these global networks, like for example, China or

433
00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:01.900
some other country?

434
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.130
Yes. So I think there's no question that the

435
00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.729
European Union can um it often pretends that it

436
00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:12.449
doesn't and it wants to, you know, play like

437
00:25:12.459 --> 00:25:14.569
uh oh we're just this little guy, you know,

438
00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:17.930
um but when you think about the original swift

439
00:25:17.939 --> 00:25:21.489
sanctions against Iran, they were actually through a European

440
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.780
Union um directive the United States pushed and wanted

441
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.556
and you know, was like saying we, we, you

442
00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:30.086
know, we want this to happen but they actually

443
00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:34.505
implemented many of those uh sanctions that cut Iranian

444
00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:36.885
banks off of the network. And the similar thing

445
00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:40.265
for the Russian Russia sanctions, we see whether it's

446
00:25:40.276 --> 00:25:44.365
the European Central Bank or the insurance companies that

447
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:46.806
are part of the oil cap. They are all

448
00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:49.692
places where there are very large European that play

449
00:25:49.702 --> 00:25:52.312
a central role in many of these networks and

450
00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:54.881
they also um can have power. I think that

451
00:25:54.891 --> 00:25:57.911
the European issue is more about the, the politics

452
00:25:57.921 --> 00:26:01.041
of it, the governance. Um WHERE, because of the

453
00:26:01.052 --> 00:26:04.171
European Union, it's a less centralized process. And so

454
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:07.511
um it's less about the, the capacity uh and

455
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:11.001
more about the political will. Um In, in the

456
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:14.660
case of China, I think um it's a, it's

457
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:19.130
a case where China often uses economic coercion. Uh

458
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.310
uh BUT most of it is a more traditional

459
00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:24.930
form of economic coercion, which I, you know, Henry

460
00:26:24.939 --> 00:26:28.170
and I would call market access. You know, they

461
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.979
say you, you're telling us that COVID maybe started

462
00:26:31.989 --> 00:26:34.390
in China, Australia. Well, then we're not going to

463
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.672
buy your coal. You know, that's, that's a very

464
00:26:36.682 --> 00:26:40.363
standard form of economic coercion and they do it

465
00:26:40.373 --> 00:26:44.123
quite a lot. Um And, but they also there's

466
00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:47.042
um pain associated with that. So they don't get

467
00:26:47.052 --> 00:26:49.572
the coal from Australia. And that, in that case,

468
00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:53.322
China ultimately backed down because they needed um that

469
00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:57.603
for their steel factories. Um I think the, the

470
00:26:58.026 --> 00:27:00.556
will China be able to create these kinds of

471
00:27:00.566 --> 00:27:03.536
economic networks that would then have this type of

472
00:27:03.546 --> 00:27:07.206
power? Uh There, there are cases where they are

473
00:27:07.215 --> 00:27:09.635
definitely trying to do that if you think about

474
00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:13.916
um the five G network. Uh AND uh Huawei,

475
00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:15.796
you know, that is one of those places where

476
00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:19.156
they are doing that. Another place um is the

477
00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:22.900
port system, the, the, there's a company called Costco,

478
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.459
which is state owned enterprise and they're working to

479
00:27:25.469 --> 00:27:29.180
invest in European and global ports uh in the

480
00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:32.500
same kind of way. Uh All that being said,

481
00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:37.959
I think we shouldn't underestimate China's capability because ultimately

482
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.369
this type of power that Henry and I describe

483
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.969
is it relies on very big, very strong private

484
00:27:46.979 --> 00:27:51.469
companies that other people depend on. And that can

485
00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:54.560
be quite challenging for the Chinese government because they

486
00:27:54.569 --> 00:28:00.219
do not really necessarily want large um uh powerful

487
00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:04.030
economic companies for their domestic stability. So if you

488
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.489
think about the story of Alibaba, it's a technology

489
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.569
company, it's very, it was, it was poised to

490
00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:14.339
be one of these kinds of companies. They had

491
00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:19.030
a financial uh application called ant Financial. That was

492
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.140
really gonna challenge I think paypal and um the

493
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:27.170
likes of Western payment systems, but the owner of

494
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.449
that company got very, I mean, he wasn't even

495
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:32.000
that politically, you just, you know, he criticized the

496
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.000
Chinese government. Um AND then he was disappeared, you

497
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.469
know, for multiple months and the company was slowly

498
00:28:37.479 --> 00:28:40.579
dismantled. Um And so I think that shows you

499
00:28:40.589 --> 00:28:42.900
that there is, it's not as easy for a

500
00:28:43.189 --> 00:28:45.089
lot of people say, well, if the US has

501
00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:48.020
all this power, why doesn't Europe or China just

502
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.790
have their own version of these things? And a

503
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.920
lot of times domestic politics gets in the way

504
00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.569
uh because building powerful economic centers is not always

505
00:28:57.579 --> 00:28:59.920
in the interest of the state. Um AND sometimes

506
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.349
just, you know, other domestic political issues get in

507
00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:04.979
the way. Uh So if you take Brexit, you

508
00:29:04.989 --> 00:29:09.050
know, it's one of the biggest uh wounds to

509
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.939
Europe's ability to play in the same space. Uh,

510
00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:16.010
IS that the, the British left? But, but not

511
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.290
because of this story, they left because of an

512
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.689
internal fight in the Conservative Party in Britain. So

513
00:29:21.709 --> 00:29:25.089
you, you never know, um, uh, what can get

514
00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:27.630
in the way of this kind of uh this

515
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.530
kind of power?

516
00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:32.000
And I would imagine that in that particular case,

517
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.880
when it comes to the European Union and China

518
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.469
specifically, uh it's also the fact that it's not

519
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.380
uh neither of their currencies being used as uh

520
00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.040
global currencies, right?

521
00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:50.390
Yes, I mean, I think that when, so one

522
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.349
of the things that we try to explain Henry

523
00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:54.339
and I in the book is that there's not

524
00:29:54.349 --> 00:29:56.619
one global network, you know, it's not like the

525
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.900
US controls all the global economy and there's multiple

526
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.199
networks. And so the dollar is one, the telecommunication

527
00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:07.020
systems, the production, you know, supply chains and in

528
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.020
the, in the dollar, in the, in the the

529
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.469
reserve currency domain, um there isn't a substitute for

530
00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.329
the US dollar. Uh And that is in part

531
00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:20.819
because of um because of Brexit uh the, the,

532
00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:23.729
you know, the weakening of the Euro financial community,

533
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:27.239
it's also part of the, the um the sovereign

534
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.239
debt crisis that happened in Europe, you know, that,

535
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.959
that the political support for AAA really a global

536
00:30:33.969 --> 00:30:36.969
currency has not been fully established around the Euro.

537
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.400
And in China, it's not a convertible currency. Uh

538
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:47.359
AND the efforts to internationalize, particularly around Hong Kong

539
00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:51.339
um have really been undermined in the last several

540
00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:54.290
years. There was a set of democracy protests in

541
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.454
Hong Kong. Uh AND then the government cracked down

542
00:30:57.464 --> 00:30:59.564
on that and then they used I think zero

543
00:30:59.574 --> 00:31:03.084
COVID as another way to kind of put pressure

544
00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:06.594
on Hong Kong. And you see that, that um

545
00:31:06.604 --> 00:31:10.739
it, it's just not the same vibrant um you

546
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.979
know, international market that it was or you know,

547
00:31:13.989 --> 00:31:17.119
if, if they had wanted to be a challenge

548
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.310
to the US dollar, they would have used Hong

549
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:22.979
Kong and that in a more strategic way. But

550
00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:27.069
instead it also presented domestic political uh issues that

551
00:31:27.079 --> 00:31:30.270
then they um they, they chose to address those.

552
00:31:31.479 --> 00:31:35.719
And how do you look at the political relationship

553
00:31:35.729 --> 00:31:40.280
between the United States and China? Would you classify

554
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.660
it as an imperial struggle in any way?

555
00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:49.560
I mean, uh so we are really focused on

556
00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:52.750
that relationship in that we see it as two

557
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.750
very powerful states that have, it's, it's a, in

558
00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.349
some ways it's an unprecedented relationship for modern uh

559
00:32:01.369 --> 00:32:03.869
uh global politics. Because if you think about the

560
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.530
Cold War, there were two great powers, but they

561
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.910
were independent from each other economically, they had very

562
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.010
few economic relations. And then in the the period

563
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.479
of like, you know, mega globalization, we had no

564
00:32:19.489 --> 00:32:22.319
real rivalry. You know, the United States was basically

565
00:32:22.329 --> 00:32:26.390
the only true global power and the world was

566
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.680
very interdependent economically. So now we're entering a phase

567
00:32:29.689 --> 00:32:32.680
where you have these, you know, the, the, the,

568
00:32:32.689 --> 00:32:36.260
the the rivalry that we saw in the Cold

569
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:40.020
War, but we have interdependence that we saw in

570
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.709
that hyper globalization moment. And so what we're worried

571
00:32:43.719 --> 00:32:46.650
about is that, you know, that this relationship, that

572
00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.449
the kind of the, the more national security, the

573
00:32:49.459 --> 00:32:53.930
more rivalry aspects will um escalate and these powers

574
00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:57.069
that we identify in our book will be used

575
00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.469
in a way that could unravel the economic interdependence.

576
00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:04.420
And um I think Henry and I want to

577
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.339
say globalization, it creates vulnerabilities. There's no question about

578
00:33:08.349 --> 00:33:10.250
that. Uh But we don't need to throw the

579
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.020
whole thing out. You know, there's plenty of places

580
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.329
where there's not uh a security risk. And so

581
00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:18.030
if, if we, if we don't do that in

582
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.969
a very thoughtful way, the, the concerns about those

583
00:33:21.979 --> 00:33:27.170
vulnerabilities could, could overwhelm uh our capacity to just

584
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.209
to protect uh the globalization enterprise.

585
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.290
But taking into account those vulnerabilities that you're mentioning

586
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.089
there. Do you look at globalization as a net

587
00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:43.170
positive or a net negative?

588
00:33:44.859 --> 00:33:46.910
So I, I mean, I, I think globalization is

589
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.280
a net positive. I mean, if you think about

590
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:53.079
even just the um the transformation and poverty in

591
00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:57.280
China uh since it entered the global economy, it's

592
00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.869
um it's tremendous. So I, I definitely, I believe

593
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.520
that globalization is a net positive but um it

594
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.260
doesn't have its problems and if we don't address

595
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:11.879
them, it could lead to the unraveling of globalization.

596
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:17.009
Um And in particular, these, these economic security issues,

597
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.858
they become very difficult because all of a sudden,

598
00:34:20.259 --> 00:34:24.268
um it's not just that globalization isn't delivering, you

599
00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:27.368
know, that was the, the kind of the, the,

600
00:34:27.378 --> 00:34:29.849
the, the central concern of the 19 nineties was

601
00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:32.349
that there was inequality um or that it was

602
00:34:32.358 --> 00:34:33.989
not, you know, the, the wealth that was being

603
00:34:33.998 --> 00:34:37.447
generated wasn't being uh properly shared. But here, the

604
00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:40.217
new concern is that globalization can be a vector

605
00:34:40.398 --> 00:34:42.819
uh of attack, you know, and so that, that

606
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:45.969
really is a much more trouble. I mean, inequality

607
00:34:45.978 --> 00:34:47.780
is also a very troubling issue. We should address

608
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.708
that too. But for policymakers when they see, you

609
00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:52.629
know, I'm opening my market and then, then that

610
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.739
could hurt me. Um That's, I think that's a

611
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.290
very difficult position to be in to say, OK,

612
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.149
we're gonna, we're gonna do this, but we're going

613
00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:01.850
to have to need to protect ourselves at the

614
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.419
same time.

615
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.780
Uh Wouldn't you say that perhaps one of the

616
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:10.820
biggest vulnerabilities in globalization is the fact that it's

617
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:16.239
very easy or fairly easy to disrupt uh commerce

618
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:21.114
and uh chains of different kinds of goods that

619
00:35:21.125 --> 00:35:25.504
perhaps many different countries are dependent on because they

620
00:35:25.705 --> 00:35:29.514
don't because they are being part of this global

621
00:35:29.524 --> 00:35:34.745
economy. Of course, they don't produce everything that they

622
00:35:34.754 --> 00:35:37.344
need in their own territory.

623
00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:43.939
Right. Yes. I mean, I think, um, one of

624
00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:49.959
the, one of the remarkable things about globalization, I

625
00:35:49.969 --> 00:35:52.669
think, and that we have to remember is how

626
00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:56.100
little disruption there has been. You know, if you

627
00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.850
think about the last, you know, from the 19

628
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.639
eighties to 40 years, how many times could you

629
00:36:02.649 --> 00:36:05.570
not get what you needed on a day to

630
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.949
day basis? You know, I, I grew up in

631
00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:12.760
a, in a world where you couldn't get avocados,

632
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.199
you know, like, unless it was a very special

633
00:36:15.209 --> 00:36:17.139
time, you know, that was like, I grew up

634
00:36:17.149 --> 00:36:20.070
in Columbus, Ohio. We, you know, I remember my

635
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.239
mother bringing home a kiwi and saying, you know,

636
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.510
this is a really special thing, you know, like

637
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.719
uh now you go to, you know, we're very

638
00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.870
privileged where, you know, to live in a, a

639
00:36:31.879 --> 00:36:35.560
very wealthy society, but there's like a wall of

640
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.949
pineapples at the store every time you go, you

641
00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:41.074
know, so I think we should, we need to

642
00:36:41.435 --> 00:36:47.004
uh not lose sight of how remarkable uh globalization

643
00:36:47.014 --> 00:36:50.655
is and how it has created a lot of,

644
00:36:50.665 --> 00:36:56.870
of just average opportunity for consumers. What I think

645
00:36:56.879 --> 00:36:59.750
the uh and, and, and, and the way it

646
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.610
has accomplished that is that in many places, it

647
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.439
creates multiple suppliers so that if one supplier falls

648
00:37:06.449 --> 00:37:09.570
out the market has another buyer for that, you

649
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.399
know, seller for that product. Um And so, you

650
00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:15.250
know, you have these global markets that then create

651
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.139
resilience. The issue is is that in some markets,

652
00:37:19.149 --> 00:37:23.550
not all of them, you have had hyper specialization

653
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.939
that to a point where only a few companies

654
00:37:25.949 --> 00:37:29.699
are capable of making the product that is necessary.

655
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.189
So if you think about TS MC or Apple

656
00:37:34.199 --> 00:37:36.820
and Google with the operating systems, um or the

657
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.610
banks, the global banks, there are a few people

658
00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.590
that can replace those companies. So if, if something

659
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.290
happens to them, um then the global economy can

660
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.870
be in trouble. And that's where, then these, the,

661
00:37:49.879 --> 00:37:53.610
the governments have recognized that as to, to understand

662
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.979
that these certain um market uh players cannot be

663
00:37:58.989 --> 00:38:02.284
substitute. And that's why they are so powerful if

664
00:38:02.294 --> 00:38:05.955
they're used either for surveillance or to toggle access.

665
00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:07.375
And so I don't want to paint a picture

666
00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:11.364
that like globalization is rife with uh terribleness and,

667
00:38:11.485 --> 00:38:13.564
you know, it's, it's, and that's why I think

668
00:38:13.574 --> 00:38:16.635
we need to have a strategy to focus on

669
00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:19.364
it because most of globalization, it's like the shoes,

670
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:22.389
you know, it's like they're not a security threat,

671
00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:23.629
at least in my mind, you know, it was

672
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:26.790
like at the end, they're, they're also not that

673
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.959
vulnerable to, to supply shocks, but there are these

674
00:38:29.969 --> 00:38:32.840
areas which are and that we need to um

675
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.300
we need to focus on them.

676
00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:37.639
No, I I mean, one of the reasons why

677
00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:40.600
I'm also asking you these questions is also to

678
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.909
dispel some of the myths and sometimes even conspiracy

679
00:38:45.919 --> 00:38:50.560
theories that people develop around the concept of globalization

680
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:54.969
because sometimes they even get into things like uh

681
00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.219
it being a threat to national sovereignty of different

682
00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:04.209
countries and sometimes individual liberties. So I, I guess

683
00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:10.060
it's important also to really uh explain how things

684
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.219
really work in globalization.

685
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.350
Right. Definitely. Mhm.

686
00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:18.260
So let's get into the last point of our

687
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:21.899
interview that I would like to explore here. So

688
00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:28.939
taking into account these global networks, the global economy

689
00:39:28.949 --> 00:39:31.850
and so on in what ways do you think

690
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.629
we could leverage them in the, in the service

691
00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:40.750
of something other than imperialism that would perhaps better

692
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.530
serve the interests of uh the global population?

693
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.100
Yes. So I think the most important thing is

694
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.399
that uh we need to think about wrapping the

695
00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:56.350
use of these tools uh in legitimacy and that

696
00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.149
can come in a, in a number of different

697
00:39:58.159 --> 00:40:01.580
ways. Uh But the, the p the problem is

698
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.770
when power is used, uh you know, just with

699
00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.870
soul power and that then comes across as imperialism

700
00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:11.510
because people are not on board. And then they're

701
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.860
saying the only reason I'm doing this is because

702
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.370
you're forcing me to do it. I think there

703
00:40:16.379 --> 00:40:19.320
are a number of um you know, you can

704
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.770
use many examples of what has the United States

705
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.419
tried to do with these powers. It's everything from

706
00:40:25.449 --> 00:40:28.870
um tried to confront terrorism to prevent the spread

707
00:40:28.879 --> 00:40:33.129
of weapons of mass mass destruction. To um respond

708
00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:36.955
to territorial aggression in the case of Ukraine um

709
00:40:36.965 --> 00:40:40.915
to uh to fight human rights abuses in China

710
00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:43.645
and other places. Uh It, it, I think it

711
00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:47.715
could be used to deal with the climate crisis.

712
00:40:47.985 --> 00:40:50.074
It could also be used to deal with corruption

713
00:40:50.104 --> 00:40:54.929
issues, all of these things. It's not the topic.

714
00:40:55.149 --> 00:40:57.449
That is the problem. You know, it's not like,

715
00:40:57.459 --> 00:41:00.969
well, anybody that tries to deal with uh nuclear

716
00:41:00.979 --> 00:41:05.570
proliferation is an imperialist. For me, it's about how

717
00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.639
do you create a consensus in the global community

718
00:41:09.649 --> 00:41:11.560
that this is something that we all need to

719
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.989
address. Uh And so the more that these powers

720
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.830
are used unilaterally without some kind of coalition building,

721
00:41:18.929 --> 00:41:21.199
I think the more likely it is that there

722
00:41:21.209 --> 00:41:24.469
will be a backlash to their use. Um And

723
00:41:24.479 --> 00:41:27.590
so that's where I think, um you know, you

724
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.389
can see things that create a lot of friction.

725
00:41:30.399 --> 00:41:33.550
Like when the Trump administration withdrew from the J

726
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.820
CPO A and forced the sanctions back on European

727
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.959
firms. It was a moment where, you know, Europe

728
00:41:40.969 --> 00:41:42.709
realized it couldn't do anything. It was, it was

729
00:41:42.719 --> 00:41:45.919
impotent to respond to that moment and it was

730
00:41:45.929 --> 00:41:49.550
against Europe's preferences. And there was very little consultation.

731
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.110
It was, you know, it seemed like a, you

732
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.820
know, that decision you could have imagined it have

733
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.250
have rolled out in a different way where there

734
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.989
would have been less of a rupture if it

735
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.370
had been done with some kind of diplomatic uh

736
00:42:04.379 --> 00:42:06.969
conversation. I think the same kind of thing with

737
00:42:06.979 --> 00:42:10.770
the Russia sanctions. On the one hand, I think

738
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.270
they were remarkable in the way the US government

739
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.020
worked with European allies to do it in co

740
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.419
ordination with each other. And it was not the

741
00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:20.790
US government saying we're gonna do this and you

742
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.550
know that it was very much a collaborative um

743
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.310
enterprise. And in that way, I think it was

744
00:42:26.899 --> 00:42:30.310
on one hand, much more, less imperial than it

745
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.600
could have been. On the other hand, I think

746
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:37.219
the Russia sanctions, uh its limitation have been, it's

747
00:42:37.229 --> 00:42:40.429
the way the West has communicated them to the

748
00:42:40.439 --> 00:42:43.590
rest of the world. And so you see countries

749
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.189
like um Indonesia or Saudi Arabia or Brazil saying,

750
00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:50.879
why should we do this? What are we, what

751
00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:55.639
do we get from this uh a action? And

752
00:42:55.649 --> 00:42:58.030
even could we be threatened by it? You know,

753
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.870
when uh the European Union puts the, the oil

754
00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:05.949
cap in place, you see countries like Indonesia saying,

755
00:43:06.149 --> 00:43:09.590
well, are you gonna do that for other commodities,

756
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.540
you know, create a cap, a price cap? Like

757
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.600
that's that, that's kind of scary for us. So

758
00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:17.669
I think the um a lot of times the

759
00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:21.149
US or Europe acts and thinks it's just doing

760
00:43:21.159 --> 00:43:24.350
good stuff. Um BUT it needs to create the

761
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.830
political will and legitimacy globally uh to, to, to,

762
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.629
to wrap around that action so that it's not

763
00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:34.510
seen as just the brute force power?

764
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.899
Mhm So one last question then looking mainly at

765
00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:45.820
the current uh political uh context globally, do you

766
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.139
look at the way we could or should leverage

767
00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:56.300
these global networks optimistically or more pessimistically?

768
00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.280
So I um I think you can see that

769
00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:06.669
policymakers are are focusing more and more on this

770
00:44:06.679 --> 00:44:10.540
question. So the European Union released uh an economic

771
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.199
security agenda. It was about a year ago, it

772
00:44:13.209 --> 00:44:16.060
was in June where they start to say, OK,

773
00:44:16.179 --> 00:44:18.760
the world is a vulnerable place. We do need

774
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:20.870
to address these issues because I think it's also

775
00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:23.600
it's Pollyanna to think that these aren't there. They,

776
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:25.945
we do need to them and they started to

777
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:28.284
lay out kind of like a framework for when

778
00:44:28.294 --> 00:44:30.735
would we use these types of powers? How could

779
00:44:30.745 --> 00:44:32.895
we use them? So I think that's a very

780
00:44:32.905 --> 00:44:37.114
encouraging um effort. You see the Biden administration in

781
00:44:37.125 --> 00:44:40.125
the United States doing a number of things that

782
00:44:40.135 --> 00:44:44.645
are trying to um embed this use of power

783
00:44:44.655 --> 00:44:48.070
in constraints of saying we're not going to just

784
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.870
do this alone, we're going to uh not do

785
00:44:50.879 --> 00:44:53.870
it for everything. So they uh in the semiconductor

786
00:44:53.879 --> 00:44:58.010
space, they have tried to work with Japan and

787
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:02.030
um the Netherlands in a collective or coordinate way

788
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.459
as they impose export controls on China. It's an

789
00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:08.199
example where I think previous administrations might have just

790
00:45:08.209 --> 00:45:10.070
done it by themselves. And so that's like a

791
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.860
that's a way to um constrain these powers. Similarly,

792
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.870
the Biden administration has described what they call um

793
00:45:18.879 --> 00:45:22.709
a small yard high fence approach to technological restraints

794
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.540
on China. They're trying to say we're not going

795
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.489
to do this everywhere. You know, we're, we're, we're

796
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.149
going to limit our actions into these most threatening

797
00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.429
areas. So I think those are all really good

798
00:45:34.439 --> 00:45:40.399
examples of policymakers trying to limit the fallout from

799
00:45:40.409 --> 00:45:43.669
using these tools. At the same time. I think

800
00:45:43.679 --> 00:45:47.060
like the glass half empty approach is um we're

801
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:51.300
still using them. I think in AAA pretty crisis

802
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:55.030
response type of way and things that we thought

803
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.370
were the ceiling of the types of power that

804
00:45:58.379 --> 00:46:00.800
we would use are becoming the floor. You know,

805
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.239
we used to really worry about using the swift

806
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:06.370
system uh as a tool. Now, you know, we're

807
00:46:06.379 --> 00:46:09.320
using central bank reserves as you know, freezing assets.

808
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.429
It's like that's like way that the current question

809
00:46:12.439 --> 00:46:15.850
is, will we take those central bank assets that

810
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.810
we froze from Russia and give them to Ukraine?

811
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.699
That's unprecedented. You know, that's really a very radical

812
00:46:22.709 --> 00:46:25.860
step. So I think we still need to have

813
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:32.020
um like a strategic doctrine or an international law

814
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.820
of economic coercion where we say this is what's

815
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.729
this is what is proportional, this is what is

816
00:46:36.739 --> 00:46:39.810
responsible use of these things. Um And that's why

817
00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.429
Henry and I wrote this book was to start

818
00:46:41.439 --> 00:46:45.449
a debate and say, you know, th this transformation

819
00:46:45.459 --> 00:46:48.169
is happening in the world, you see it in

820
00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:51.790
export controls and sanctions in all these different tremors.

821
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.370
But they're really connected. And if we don't have

822
00:46:54.379 --> 00:46:57.590
a, a common conversation about them, uh things could,

823
00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.709
could get out of control.

824
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:02.280
So I guess that's a great note to end

825
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.090
on. And the book, the book is again, Underground

826
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:09.800
Empire. How America weaponize the world economy. I'm leaving

827
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.649
a link to it in the description box of

828
00:47:11.659 --> 00:47:14.830
the interview. And Dr Newman, just before we go

829
00:47:14.879 --> 00:47:17.379
apart from the book, would you like to tell

830
00:47:17.389 --> 00:47:20.070
people where they can find you and your work

831
00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.030
on the internet?

832
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.479
Sure. So I am at Georgetown University. Uh You

833
00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:28.810
could find me there. Uh OR I'm also, I'm

834
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.010
actually not on Twitter anymore. I'm not doing that

835
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.370
anymore. So you could just find me on, on

836
00:47:33.379 --> 00:47:36.429
the Georgetown website and I'm happy to answer questions

837
00:47:36.439 --> 00:47:37.050
