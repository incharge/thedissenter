00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.360
the Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.739
And today I'm joined for a second time by

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.270
Doctor David Pietrzyk. He is assistant professor in the

5
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.439
Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University

6
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.459
of California Santa Barbara. He is an experimental psychologist

7
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:22.399
who applies evolutionary theorizing to social cognitive and developmental

8
00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.950
questions. And uh as I mentioned, this is a

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.040
our second interview on the show. So I'm leaving

10
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:32.770
a link to the first one in the description

11
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.750
of this one. And today we're talking about social

12
00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:42.110
categorization, alliance membership and detection, intergroup conflict. Uh David

13
00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.819
pins off and Marty Hazleton's paper on their alliance

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.729
theory of political belief systems and some other topics.

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.029
So, Doctor Piotr Zeps, welcome back to the show.

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.779
It's always a pleasure to talk with you.

17
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.860
Thank you, Ricardo. It's a, it's a pleasure to

18
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:56.189
be here.

19
00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:00.029
So, one of the things we talked about in

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.559
our first conversation was social categorization and alliance detection,

21
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.519
the alliance detection system. So how does it apply

22
00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:13.080
specifically to race categorization?

23
00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.000
Sure. So this is an idea that um people

24
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.319
noticed that people have been categorizing people by race,

25
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.809
since people started measuring categorization processes starting around the

26
00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.169
eighties. And um for a long time, people sort

27
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.449
of took for granted what the mechanisms underlying that

28
00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.870
categorization were. When people started thinking about it, there

29
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.029
were a few options. One was, well, maybe there

30
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.550
are systems in the mind for categorizing people by

31
00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:42.410
race. Uh Another possibility is that it's a by

32
00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.279
product of other adaptations. Um And for a long

33
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.019
time, people couldn't get people to not categorize people

34
00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:49.910
by race. And you can look at that implicitly

35
00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.004
by looking at things like patterns of memory errors.

36
00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:54.175
So you show somebody a face in a statement,

37
00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:57.095
you see, do they mis attribute what one woman

38
00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:59.654
said to another woman, what one man said to

39
00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.525
another man to the degree they do that they

40
00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.245
have categorized by, for example, sex. But you can

41
00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:06.464
do that for things like age sex, race or

42
00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:09.127
any other social category. Um And what people found

43
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.938
was people always categorized by age, sex and race.

44
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.539
Um And the question of why do they categorize

45
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:16.658
by race. Um And so what I've done in

46
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.259
some of my work and we talked about this

47
00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:20.578
a little bit last time you and I talked.

48
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.498
Um AND I've got a number of papers now

49
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.658
along with other colleagues showing that the system that's

50
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.738
categorizing people by race. Um What it seems to

51
00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.658
be is a system for tracking alliances. So the

52
00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.389
idea is that race as we think about it

53
00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.199
is very superficial skin deep, um uh adaptations for

54
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.000
things like climate exposure, um maybe pathogen exposure um

55
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.490
or, and, but those superficial features are not things

56
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.440
that the mind is necessarily designed to attend to.

57
00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.449
Um YOU can kind of think of it as

58
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.330
analogous to like, you know, differences in the way

59
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.940
people's hair color look um or, or other superficial

60
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.740
traits. Like we don't seem to think of those

61
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.229
as racial per se. So the question is why

62
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.899
do people have this experience pop out of this

63
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.619
constellation of features uh as race. And so the

64
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.649
idea is that um there's not a system looking

65
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.679
for those physical features, but instead systems that learn

66
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.080
about which physical features predict how people interact and

67
00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.729
get along. So the idea is that there are

68
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.580
adaptations in the mind for categorizing people by their

69
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.669
alliances and that that system when it grows up

70
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.600
in a culture where certain physical features predict how

71
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.000
people interact and get along, like where do people

72
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.000
live, who has access to what resources things like

73
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.820
that, then that system will um pick up on

74
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.119
those physical features. And we can test that by

75
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.000
showing that when you um show that race is

76
00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.779
not predictive of how people interact and get along.

77
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.039
So it's crossed with alliance membership um that you

78
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.199
can get categorization by race to go down uh

79
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.759
and to be inhibited in the cognitive system. So

80
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.479
basically, the mind is treating race as a socially

81
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.399
learned, socially constructed category. That's about anticipating patterns of

82
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.649
affiliation. And that's basically the, the, the relationship between

83
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:19.839
this alliance system and race.

84
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.339
Mhm. A and even when it comes to that

85
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.250
social categorization of race or in terms of race,

86
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.750
I mean, w we have to also to keep

87
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.130
in mind the fact that the way we understand

88
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.269
the concept of race and the different races we

89
00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:44.390
recognize, I mean, it's very much as some sociologists

90
00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:48.609
have been arguing, it's very much uh a result

91
00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:53.079
of social and cultural inputs because even for example,

92
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.459
in the us, the different race categories or how

93
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.410
people from different origins have been categorized in terms

94
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.540
of their race has changed over time.

95
00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.959
That's right. You can look historically um across cultures

96
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.029
within cultures. So, you know, turn of the century

97
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.839
being Irish was literally perceived as a race in

98
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.220
the United States. Um You know, if you look

99
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.600
in places, um you know, um where there's been

100
00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:23.924
histories, sort of genocides or ethnic conflicts, the physical

101
00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:29.494
distinctions between the groups. Um um uh FOR example,

102
00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:33.165
in Rwanda, um would were actually just completely made

103
00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:35.195
up, there were in fact no basis in reality.

104
00:05:35.204 --> 00:05:38.964
And so, um it's pretty clear, the historical record,

105
00:05:38.975 --> 00:05:41.225
the sociological record is fairly clear that if you

106
00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:45.369
look at it, um the uh the alliances, the

107
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.970
affiliations, those dynamics dictate which physical features become important.

108
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.029
You don't need physical distinctions to have alliance differences.

109
00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.730
Um And, and those can be projected or hallucinated

110
00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:01.980
on. And there are many physical differences that are

111
00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:05.910
not perceived as alliances even developmentally, um which is

112
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.170
a beautiful test of this idea. Um Even Children

113
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:13.570
learn um labels before they um learn who those

114
00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:16.489
labels apply to. So if you show who to

115
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.010
an adults uh look like people of different races,

116
00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.250
Children might not understand that those are significant differences

117
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.299
between those people. They won't notice it, they won't

118
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.730
remark on it. But if you give Children labels

119
00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:33.179
that refer to um count classes of, of people,

120
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.109
so these are the XS, these are the Ys

121
00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.359
Children immediately understand that it's relevant and important. They

122
00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:41.059
remember it, they recall it. Um They seem to

123
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.630
infer its social significance even before they understand what

124
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.059
criteria place somebody into those categories. So they really

125
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.959
seem to go label first, alliance first um Not

126
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.709
which Q happens to go along with that. Yeah.

127
00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:57.450
Mhm

128
00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:01.190
And we, when we are dealing with alliance membership

129
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.720
specifically, does the way we consider the categorizations in

130
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.869
terms of race change is there and the effect

131
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.100
there.

132
00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:13.920
Well, so um it depends what you mean. Um

133
00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:15.709
There's a couple of ways to answer that question.

134
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.000
Um One is that um so traditionally, when people

135
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.869
had been measuring social categorization by race, they hadn't

136
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.869
been providing additional alliance information. Um And we're gonna

137
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.630
use alliance and coalition sort of interchangeably. We don't

138
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.230
really know all the details. But essentially, um if

139
00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:39.200
you don't give people a specific acute social alliance,

140
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.540
like this is a group and here's another group

141
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.380
and this is their relationship, that kind of thing.

142
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.779
If you don't provide that people will default to

143
00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:50.329
what are in their culture, the most relevant or

144
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:53.170
important alliance cues. And so for many of the

145
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:58.059
studies conducted um over the years in social psychology

146
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.890
and these social categorization studies, the most relevant alliance

147
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.049
dimension in the stimuli was race. So race was

148
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:07.950
always a feature of categorization in these studies, even

149
00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.760
when it wasn't relevant. So even when people are

150
00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:10.989
talking about what are they going to do on

151
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.119
a summer day or what is it like to

152
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.779
be at this university or something like that? So,

153
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.070
um so in that respect, um racial categorization seem

154
00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:24.130
pretty immovable. But the crucial thing is that for

155
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.709
the alliance tracking system, part of its evolved function,

156
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.290
one of the things that has to do to

157
00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:32.820
um to make its living as an evolved system

158
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.049
within our um evolved um design is to be

159
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:41.039
really good at tracking alliances, storing instances of alliances,

160
00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.619
but then also figuring out which alliance is relevant

161
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.039
for this situation because there are many, many alliances.

162
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:50.780
But in any particular situation, only a subset of

163
00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:54.859
those alliances are relevant for predicting how people interact.

164
00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.340
And that's the point of the system, it's to

165
00:08:56.349 --> 00:09:00.260
predict behavior, guide behavior. Um And so, one of

166
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.340
its design features needs to be the ability to

167
00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:06.520
take all of the alliance cues that it is

168
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.679
stored, use some sort of criteria for establishing which

169
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.500
of all of those is most relevant in inhibiting

170
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.619
the use of the others. And so what we

171
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.489
have in our studies is evidence of that process

172
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.080
where if you show this previously diagnostic alliance to

173
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.229
race, but you show people now a specific context

174
00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:32.469
where there's people of different races, but there's new

175
00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.270
better alliance membership information. So here's one group, here's

176
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.400
another group, here's the way they're interacting can be

177
00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:41.119
positive, it can be negative, it can be coordinations

178
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.559
in any case. What we have very good evidence

179
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.020
for is that the system can very easily take

180
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.960
the racial information, inhibit the use of it categorization

181
00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:55.820
in many cases, goes completely away or it's reduced

182
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.390
by, you know, somewhere between a third to two

183
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.940
thirds. Um And in some cases, it's not even

184
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:07.830
happening while the new alliance cues are um are

185
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.520
very quickly picked up in ca base the basis

186
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.479
of categorization. So the answer to your question is

187
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.890
the relationship between race and alliance really depends on

188
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.869
if there's other better new alliance uh cues um

189
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.210
present in the stimuli. And if that's true, categorization

190
00:10:24.219 --> 00:10:26.390
by race will go down. But if there's no

191
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.799
better alliance information, then categorization by race will be

192
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:33.429
a prepotent sort of default alliance cue on the

193
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.489
idea that in the world it is a relevant

194
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.330
alliance cue and the idea would be that to

195
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.559
the extent it's not relevant out in the world,

196
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.250
it would be no longer be quite as prepotent.

197
00:10:44.489 --> 00:10:47.919
Um, AND in, in principle could be, um, it

198
00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:49.489
could be something else. It wouldn't have to be

199
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.250
those particular cues you wouldn't even need, um, um,

200
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.969
something like race per se. Um, AND in, you

201
00:10:55.979 --> 00:10:59.909
know, in certain places, um, that's, um, arguably it's,

202
00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:02.950
there are other sort of most prepotent dimensions like,

203
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.950
you know, the tribe down the river or something

204
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.989
like that. It's not quite like the way we

205
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.590
think about race. So, yeah,

206
00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:12.976
so uh while you were talking, the, there were

207
00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:15.926
some ideas crossing my mind and I'm going to

208
00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:19.645
say something and if I'm incorrect, please say so.

209
00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:23.745
But I was thinking that uh is it correct

210
00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:27.195
to say that perhaps when it comes to uh

211
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:31.835
making alliances, uh how we think about other people

212
00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:35.281
in terms of being to protect allies or not?

213
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.062
I mean, of course, we look at people and

214
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:41.252
we see how they are different from us in

215
00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:44.742
several different traits and some of them might fall

216
00:11:44.752 --> 00:11:50.171
into different social categories related to age, gender, race

217
00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:54.489
or any other sort of social category. But, and

218
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.809
when it comes to looking at people and seeing

219
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.799
the differences that exist between us and them, uh

220
00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:06.729
and thinking about alliances, I mean, the fact that

221
00:12:06.739 --> 00:12:09.729
we see that someone might have, I don't know

222
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.369
a different gender, different skin color or something like

223
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.440
that. Uh, AND we think about that in terms

224
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.049
of it being a good or a bad trait.

225
00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:21.650
It is, uh, uh, it has a lot to

226
00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:24.739
do with context. It's context dependent, right? Because it

227
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.719
is probably, at least when we are dealing with

228
00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:31.510
alliance membership, it has a lot to do with

229
00:12:31.609 --> 00:12:36.429
the people having traits that would be beneficial to

230
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.729
us or not. That, I mean, does this make

231
00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:40.400
sense or?

232
00:12:41.179 --> 00:12:43.619
Yeah, I mean, I think, I think if you

233
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.809
think about it from sort of a first principals

234
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:51.140
perspective, um and when we're actually doing some modeling

235
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.520
work, so Dan Conroy Beam, who is another um

236
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.820
faculty member at UC Santa Barbara and the psychology

237
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.520
department, um We're doing some modeling work on this.

238
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.039
But basically, um if you just imagine a world

239
00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.320
where um like a simple world where we just

240
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.619
sort of think of traits as just ABC de,

241
00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.369
you know, all the way, all the letters in

242
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.390
the alphabet and you just sort of think, well,

243
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.000
what would an organism or an agent? Um How

244
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.950
would they carve up the world? Um HOW would

245
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.080
a well designed organism, um carve up the world

246
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.989
um again, well designed meaning, you know, naturally selected.

247
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.729
So what would be the design of this alliance

248
00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:32.059
tracking system? And what I would want to do

249
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.119
is it would want to look out in the

250
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.489
world and see, well, you know, um what likely

251
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.710
um um uh is the basis of cooper operation

252
00:13:41.719 --> 00:13:44.419
that yields benefits to me. So, in a sense,

253
00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:46.530
you know, in a world where there is no

254
00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.669
conflict, there's no reason to exclude anybody from your

255
00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.000
pool of cooperators to the extent they'll give you

256
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.630
resources to the extent that um they can generate

257
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.159
benefits, you know, gains and trade things like that.

258
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.989
And so, um there's no intrinsic reason in the

259
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.229
design of the system to sort of discriminate um

260
00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:08.460
along any of those cues and there's no reason

261
00:14:08.469 --> 00:14:10.880
to not have um as many people in your

262
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.119
cooper effort as possible. Now, you can add additional

263
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.780
principles and you can say, well, look as the

264
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:19.380
pool of cooperators gets bigger, it's harder to track

265
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.590
people's investment in the common good. And so you

266
00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:24.000
get, you know, the free write of problem, those

267
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.559
kinds of things. And so you can start to

268
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.440
see where theories of sort of what's the, the

269
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.239
size of the group or identity that you belong

270
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.580
to. So their ideas in social psychology about sort

271
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.320
of optimal distinctiveness. And I think that that's a,

272
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.390
a very valid and nice way to think about

273
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.020
things. But I think it's underwritten by this sort

274
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.020
of deeper principle of um the trade off between

275
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:51.159
um um sort of being able to ascertain what's

276
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:56.700
happening um and monitor for it and um be

277
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.739
uh be benefited by a collective versus the strength

278
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.719
of the collective so a very large collective may

279
00:15:02.729 --> 00:15:06.020
not care much about me. Give me many benefits,

280
00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:07.849
but it's very powerful and there's a bit of

281
00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:09.729
a trade off there. So then you start to

282
00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:14.549
get into a basis of discrimination where you want,

283
00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:17.890
uh, the people who are closer to you maybe

284
00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:21.169
care more about you to be the people that

285
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.200
you're most in a group with. Or if they're

286
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.570
sort of different groups, like the, you have one

287
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.239
closer group and then one larger group, right? And

288
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.440
then you add something like conflict where people have

289
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.349
conflicts of interest, same people. Um um THE same

290
00:15:37.359 --> 00:15:39.979
people want um the same things, right? So you

291
00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:42.049
want something, I want something and we both can't

292
00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:45.510
have it so excludable goods, rival goods um or,

293
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.909
you know, we something we have a misunderstanding or

294
00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:51.070
just a conflict. Um uh You know, I take

295
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.849
something here as you take something online, you add

296
00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:55.010
that in as well. And then all of a

297
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.840
sudden it becomes in agent's interests to um have

298
00:15:58.849 --> 00:16:03.489
other agents really differentially exclude some uh in favor

299
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.849
of others. Um And so you, you add all

300
00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.909
of those dynamics and, and then you can see

301
00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:13.460
where um you very quickly get certain cues become

302
00:16:13.469 --> 00:16:16.820
the things that mark the people that you feel

303
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.190
positively about versus the people you feel neutrally about

304
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.580
versus the people you feel negatively about. But the

305
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:28.109
important thing is the underlying calculation in principle is

306
00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:33.369
based on these costs and benefit resource flows, benefit

307
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.239
flows, the superficial cues take up a lot of

308
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.049
our attention. So, is it about skin color? Is

309
00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:43.419
it about um what people dress like? All those

310
00:16:43.429 --> 00:16:45.340
things sort of take up our attention? Because those

311
00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:47.510
are the things we're conscious of because they actually

312
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.679
distinguish between these alliances. Um But the, but the

313
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.039
idea is that below that superficial variation are these

314
00:16:55.049 --> 00:16:58.859
very common deep principles in that from an engineering

315
00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:02.330
perspective, from the perspective of describing the psychology and

316
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.569
then also the dynamics um those uh those dimensions

317
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:11.079
of costs and benefits uh are really what's important

318
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.500
for the evolved psychology.

319
00:17:13.979 --> 00:17:17.959
And uh just to close the section on race

320
00:17:17.969 --> 00:17:22.180
categorization, is there any evidence that it can be

321
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:26.329
lowered by cross categories that have nothing to do

322
00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.660
with alliances?

323
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.060
Hm Yeah, this is a good question. So I've

324
00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:33.849
been doing these um reducing racial categorization studies with

325
00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:36.189
alliances for many, many years now. I mean, it's

326
00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:40.729
been a decade and um really beautiful data, lots

327
00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:45.270
of um different kinds of alliances. So positive alliances

328
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.900
like two groups, not in conflict, but each group

329
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.939
highly cooper within each group. Um And then other

330
00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:55.199
situations where there's antagonism between groups and then other

331
00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:58.349
situations where each group is just has opinions or

332
00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:01.739
are coordinate. All of these things are print in

333
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.660
principle alliance cues and all these things produce this

334
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.229
expected effect of reducing categorization by race. And I

335
00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:11.280
should point out not categorization by other social categories

336
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.949
like um sex or age, which is important because

337
00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:17.040
it shows that it really seems to be something

338
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.699
about race and alliance, not just that alliance is

339
00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:24.079
just cause you to not attend to any other

340
00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:26.770
cross dimension like age, sex or race. It's really

341
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.459
specific to race. Um That's actually important just as

342
00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:35.390
an aside because most theories of social categorization, at

343
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.489
least those that were most prevalent at the end

344
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.040
of the 20th century and early 21st century can't

345
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.989
account for that selective um pattern because on those

346
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.910
theories, um age, sex and race are all chronically

347
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.680
activated categories. So anyway, that's, that's sort of an

348
00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:52.670
aside, um the question you're asking is um what

349
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.839
about non alliance categories? And the reason why you're

350
00:18:54.849 --> 00:18:57.199
asking that is I realized after all these beautiful

351
00:18:57.209 --> 00:19:00.219
studies had been done um that there was one

352
00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:02.819
counter hypothesis that I never tested against and that

353
00:19:02.829 --> 00:19:05.510
could falsify the entire account. And so I thought

354
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.250
in a, in a very pian way, I, I

355
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.290
needed to try to falsify my own theory. And

356
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.150
so, um so I just mentioned categorization by race

357
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.770
would go down when categorization by sex and age,

358
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.810
for example, would not. Um And specifically when it

359
00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:24.829
was through alliances. So when we would show alliance

360
00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:29.270
stimuli in the um in the studies, so there's

361
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.300
one group and another group in their alliances that

362
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.800
specifically was causing categorization by race to go down

363
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.780
and not sex or age. And we were using

364
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.530
that to infer the activation of the alliance system.

365
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.099
But what I realized was that it could just

366
00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:48.199
be that categorization by race is just more flexible

367
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:50.489
now, that would not be consistent with the past

368
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.939
work. But at least it would be consistent with

369
00:19:53.369 --> 00:19:57.449
my pattern of results. Selective decrease in was compared

370
00:19:57.459 --> 00:19:59.729
to age or sex under the exact same experimental

371
00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:03.510
conditions. So what I wanted to do is do

372
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.209
the exact same experimental structure where instead of the

373
00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:13.359
social categorization dimension being alliances, it was something that

374
00:20:13.369 --> 00:20:15.250
there was no alliance information. And so what I

375
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.400
used is um um whether you're older or younger

376
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.520
siblings. So um some people were older siblings, some

377
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.699
people were younger siblings, they were visually marked. So

378
00:20:25.709 --> 00:20:27.579
whether they were older or younger, they had different

379
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:30.260
color t-shirts, the conversation was about being older or

380
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.089
younger sibling. I made sure to minimize the alliance

381
00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.599
cues. So there was no information about the older

382
00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:39.420
siblings or the younger siblings sort of teaming up

383
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.089
together, roughly speaking. Um And so this was really

384
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:47.339
important to show that uh categorization by race would

385
00:20:47.349 --> 00:20:51.689
not be selectively reduced by these non alliance stimuli.

386
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.180
And um fortunately for the theory, um you know,

387
00:20:55.189 --> 00:20:58.219
and you know, just um to editorialize for me

388
00:20:58.229 --> 00:21:00.150
personally, it was nice to see but you know,

389
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.119
what, what matters is is what the data tell

390
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.819
you. Um That in fact, categorization by race was

391
00:21:05.829 --> 00:21:08.780
not affected at all by crossing race with this

392
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.719
uh older or younger sibling dimension. Um But people

393
00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:15.790
categorize very strongly by this older or younger sibling

394
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.719
dimension as well. So, categorization by both sex and

395
00:21:18.729 --> 00:21:21.729
race were unaffected by it. So it's a nice

396
00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:27.109
um example of um um taking a hypothesis and

397
00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.060
not only confirming it with a number of studies,

398
00:21:30.069 --> 00:21:33.469
but then also um once you've confirmed it actually

399
00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:35.729
starting to try to actively falsify it. And this

400
00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:39.069
was a nice example of failing to falsify um

401
00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:42.430
the hypothesis. So the hypothesis um is getting more,

402
00:21:42.439 --> 00:21:46.030
more support. So that's, that's the the answer um

403
00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:49.609
for why um we ran those studies and why

404
00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:52.280
um categorization by race um is not affected by

405
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.310
these other things. Yeah.

406
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.489
So changing topics, I would like to talk a

407
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.790
little bit about uh conflict and peace uh from

408
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.819
an evolutionary perspective here. So, first of all, from

409
00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:11.510
an evolutionary perspective, what drives intergroup conflict?

410
00:22:12.219 --> 00:22:16.760
Yeah, I mean, what drives intergroup conflict is um

411
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.780
in some sense, it's very um um very simple

412
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.619
things. So things like safety, um access to resources,

413
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.020
worrying about your safety, worrying about access to resources,

414
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.589
right? So it can be offensive and defensive. Um

415
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.050
And it's about social relationships. So um so people

416
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.640
have things that other people want, you worry about

417
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.709
other people taking things that you have. Um And

418
00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:47.400
especially as we talked about before there can be

419
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.560
conflicts of interest between individuals and once that occurs,

420
00:22:51.569 --> 00:22:55.579
those individuals are incentivized from an evolutionary perspective to

421
00:22:55.589 --> 00:22:59.420
get allies in support of them in, in comparison

422
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.060
to the their, the people they're competing with. And

423
00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:05.449
so that sort of sets up a dynamic where

424
00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:10.449
each agent is incentivized um and will do better

425
00:23:10.459 --> 00:23:13.209
to the extent that they can shore up allies

426
00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:16.060
in defense of themselves against the people that they

427
00:23:16.069 --> 00:23:19.540
have conflicts of interest with. Um And so, and

428
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.890
so, yeah, so, um at every scale of social

429
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.930
organization, the idea is that really what's driving um

430
00:23:25.939 --> 00:23:31.260
conflict, including multi Asian conflict are pretty simple, fundamental

431
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:36.660
things like concerns about safety concerns about resources. Um

432
00:23:36.689 --> 00:23:38.800
YOU know, and like, you know, resources, it's easy

433
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.859
to sort of, I, I often worry when we

434
00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.630
talk about resources, particularly sort of in the evolutionary

435
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.760
social sciences, people sort of think about, you know,

436
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.119
like luxury watches and things, but it's, you know,

437
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:51.489
uh you know, it's like food and like, you

438
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.290
know, things you actually need to. Um And in,

439
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.550
in a world where there's not um police or

440
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.170
military and even in a world where there is

441
00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.959
police and military, there are many people who don't

442
00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:03.599
have access to those crucial resources um and access

443
00:24:03.609 --> 00:24:06.819
to those resources, the function of social relationships and

444
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:10.010
social power. And so that's what conflict is about.

445
00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.930
Um ALL the way through it still is today.

446
00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:16.479
Um You know, even even with um organized large

447
00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:22.099
scale social world uh institutions. Um There's still massive

448
00:24:22.109 --> 00:24:24.530
differences in access to resources that are based on

449
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.869
power. Um And that's true um for, from an

450
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.709
of all perspective at every scale.

451
00:24:32.229 --> 00:24:36.310
But OK, so that's about uh conflict. But then

452
00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:39.660
do we also have a good understanding of perhaps

453
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:46.099
the psychological mechanisms that drive peace and reconciliation between

454
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:46.589
groups?

455
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.270
Yeah, I mean, I would say we don't have

456
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.910
a good understanding of psychological mechanisms generally at a

457
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.780
certain level of specificity. Um But I think in

458
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.910
terms of broadly how they would be working or

459
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.020
what they're attentive to then yes, we do. So

460
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.719
at a very high level, the answer would be

461
00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:05.630
yes. Um And it's, it goes back to what

462
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.599
we talked about earlier, which is that from a

463
00:25:07.609 --> 00:25:11.719
first principal's perspective, there are always benefits to expanding

464
00:25:11.729 --> 00:25:14.050
the pool of cooper operation if people are willing

465
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:20.170
to um uh trade off. Um So there are

466
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.979
things like, you know, variation in resources. So if

467
00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:25.359
you get and I enter in a relationship, uh

468
00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:28.329
and we're both, you know, hunter gatherers and hunting

469
00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:31.459
is high variance returns, maybe you're successful one day,

470
00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:34.000
I'm successful another, it has nothing to do with

471
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.000
how hard we try. It's just sometimes the animals

472
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.260
near you, sometimes the animal is near me. Um,

473
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.219
WE can buffer that variability in the world by

474
00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:45.640
entering into a mutually beneficial exchange relationship. And so

475
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.420
there are many, many situations where those kinds of

476
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.880
mutually beneficial exchange relationships, um, can be incentivized. And

477
00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.290
so from the perspective of agents who find themselves

478
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.750
in a world where there are conflict, uh, related

479
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.530
groups where there's violence or, um, sub violence but

480
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.609
still host in positions, things like, um, you know,

481
00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:12.329
people don't like each other. People are, um, trying

482
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:15.709
to sabotage each other, uh, in whatever way they're

483
00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:19.709
still, uh, in principle of all the design for

484
00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:21.849
other people looking at that and saying, well, it

485
00:26:21.859 --> 00:26:25.959
could be different. Maybe the people who are fighting

486
00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:27.579
each other, maybe they don't have to fight with

487
00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:30.599
me and maybe there's a basis of cooper operation

488
00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:34.060
that can transcend the, this, this pattern of violence.

489
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.920
And so the idea of imagining counterfactual alliance memberships,

490
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:44.119
imagining a different basis for trying to make it

491
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.439
through the world by and not getting hurt and

492
00:26:46.449 --> 00:26:49.390
making sure you have enough stuff um that is

493
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.079
baked into the design of the system. And so,

494
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.479
um and also not taking groups for granted. So,

495
00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:58.380
for example, um and Mike mcauliffe and I have

496
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.319
a, um A B BS commentary on um really

497
00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:05.530
nice um target article by Luke Gachi about um

498
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.040
the evolution of uh peace. And uh and one

499
00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:10.939
of the things we talk about is so from,

500
00:27:10.949 --> 00:27:15.079
from the perspective of, um, again, sort of in

501
00:27:15.089 --> 00:27:19.270
a hunter gatherer society, um um non um a

502
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.859
non wear society, um people who are in a

503
00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:26.750
group, um and some of the people in that

504
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.280
group are sort of rating another group. Um The

505
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.660
people who are not doing the rating, who are

506
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.479
not getting benefits from the rating um are incentivized

507
00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:39.119
to not frame the situation as all of us

508
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.449
in this group group A are attacking group B,

509
00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:44.599
right? It's actually a subset of us. Um So

510
00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:48.589
that's an example of where the evolved system is

511
00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:52.380
also not taking for granted the group framing. Um

512
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.849
And so it wants to narrow down the scope

513
00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:59.609
of the belligerence to the individuals actually doing the

514
00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:03.290
belligerent actions. Um AND not the broader category. Um

515
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.410
And that's part of the, the evolved psychology of

516
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.280
peace and reconciliation is to, for those people who

517
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.390
are technically in group A to say, look, other

518
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.050
group members of group A are doing bad things.

519
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.229
Uh It's imposing a cost in group B. Um

520
00:28:18.349 --> 00:28:23.109
And uh and they can um contact group B,

521
00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:25.770
for example, they can talk, contact the belligerents in

522
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.290
group A, they can just talk among other people

523
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.630
who are in their same position and non belligerent

524
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.660
in group A and sort of negotiate about what

525
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.319
to do going forward. Um So those interests of

526
00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:41.140
those people are an example of the kinds of

527
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.199
designs in the mind that should be there for

528
00:28:44.209 --> 00:28:47.910
uh group uh uh group based um conflict reduction

529
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.280
and reconciliation. So, um and again, it just comes

530
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.469
down to this issue of um conflict is very

531
00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:58.390
costly. Um And it causes retaliation. People don't like

532
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.270
it when you hurt them and when you take

533
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.819
their things. And so um the the people who

534
00:29:03.829 --> 00:29:08.780
differentially benefit from that um have an incentive to

535
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.609
expand the class of people who believe they're in

536
00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:16.349
a conflict with one another. But there's always countervailing

537
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.280
um interest for the people who are not benefiting

538
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.699
from that conflict to curtail the scope of who

539
00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:27.930
is considered in a conflict with one another. And

540
00:29:27.939 --> 00:29:32.520
I think a lot of current and historical conflicts

541
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.209
um can be understood as this tension of the

542
00:29:36.219 --> 00:29:40.670
people who benefit from a conflict want to obscure

543
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.359
who's actually benefiting how widely the conflict in fact

544
00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:49.689
goes. Um And it's in those people's interests to

545
00:29:49.699 --> 00:29:52.949
sort of obscure and make very broad the the

546
00:29:52.959 --> 00:29:56.130
the classes of people who are in conflict. Um

547
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.060
And, and then there's this countervailing force to sort

548
00:29:59.069 --> 00:30:01.640
of narrow it down to who is actually benefiting

549
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.959
who's actually doing the violence um as a way

550
00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:09.800
to curtail that and to possibly um undo some

551
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.880
of the dynamics that are leading to that conflict

552
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:12.599
and violence.

553
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.000
So I want to ask to ask you something

554
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:20.609
that particularly in the context of my show makes

555
00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:23.030
a lot of sense to ask because over the

556
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.459
years, I've had interviews with people uh that place

557
00:30:28.469 --> 00:30:32.175
themselves on either side of this ongoing debate in

558
00:30:32.185 --> 00:30:36.155
the anthropology of war and peace between the people

559
00:30:36.165 --> 00:30:39.785
who think that war is very ancient in our

560
00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:43.685
revolutionary history. That is the deep rooters. I mean,

561
00:30:43.694 --> 00:30:48.239
I've interviewed people like uh Richard Wrangham, Zar GT

562
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.540
Raymond Hames. And I'm also about to release an

563
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.150
interview with Luke Lo Ai. And then on the

564
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.420
other side, people who think that war is much

565
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.119
is a much more recent phenomenon. Uh uh I

566
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.869
mean, I've interviewed people like Brian Ferguson, uh uh

567
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.979
uh Douglas Fry and others. So do you think

568
00:31:08.989 --> 00:31:13.579
that from your perspective, what you said there about

569
00:31:13.589 --> 00:31:20.109
conflict, peace and reconciliation should also inform this debate

570
00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:21.010
or not?

571
00:31:21.589 --> 00:31:24.459
Um Well, it depends on what the people are

572
00:31:24.469 --> 00:31:30.290
debating about and why. Um I think um one

573
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.989
doesn't wanna over attribute or psychoanalyze debates too much.

574
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.900
Um But there's different levels at which a debate

575
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.479
can be happening. And I think 11 possible assumption

576
00:31:40.489 --> 00:31:43.810
going into a debate like is war ancient or

577
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:47.430
not is the issue of how inevitable is war

578
00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:51.739
and conflict. Um And I think that if you,

579
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.760
um I think one should be careful about, um

580
00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.880
assuming that that's a straightforward thing where if war

581
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.550
is recent, then it means war is avoidable. Um

582
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.660
But if it's long standing, it isn't. Um I

583
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.920
think that's oversimplified and that's sort of wrong because

584
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.560
um actually, to the extent that conflict is a

585
00:32:12.569 --> 00:32:18.229
long standing element of human evolutionary environments because conflict

586
00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:20.689
is costly, we would expect all kinds of very

587
00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:23.339
good design to avoid conflict. We see this in

588
00:32:23.349 --> 00:32:25.489
biotic conflicts all the time. Right. So there's a

589
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.170
large literature called the Asymmetric War of attrition where

590
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.030
animals, um, basically avoid the cost of escalating conflict

591
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.369
by doing things like, you know, very ritualized, you

592
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.709
know, some sort of like deer, sort of walking

593
00:32:39.719 --> 00:32:42.449
back and forth in parallel to assess size differences.

594
00:32:42.459 --> 00:32:45.969
And if one's much bigger than another, they, they,

595
00:32:45.979 --> 00:32:48.369
they'll just the, the smaller one will back down,

596
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.459
both are doing that because there are selection pressures

597
00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:55.540
to avoid conflict because conflict is costly. If you

598
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.910
can, if you can basically find the information that

599
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.339
you would eventually get at the end of a

600
00:33:00.349 --> 00:33:03.900
very costly conflict before the conflict even starts. There's

601
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.530
good selection pressures for to do that on both

602
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.020
parties sides. So that's an example of die a

603
00:33:10.089 --> 00:33:14.079
conflict over something like territory is a long standing

604
00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:17.630
part of deer psychology. And because of that, uh,

605
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.359
there is extra design to avoid the cost of

606
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:24.229
that conflict. So analogously, if we say something like

607
00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:27.150
large scale conflict and what counts as large scale,

608
00:33:27.729 --> 00:33:30.829
that's a definition in there are just facts on

609
00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:33.430
the matter on the ground of how many people,

610
00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:37.270
historically, how many hominids lived historically, what were the

611
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.739
scales of conflict? Those are, you know, facts that

612
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.520
we can establish either deductively or looking at the

613
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.709
arch archaeological record or possibly genetic record. Um, AND

614
00:33:47.719 --> 00:33:49.800
we'll just find out what we find out. But

615
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:53.069
in terms of this issue of if large scale

616
00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:57.949
conflict, something like war, um, was pervasive. That really

617
00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:03.150
doesn't mean that war is currently more inevitable because

618
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.430
of the design of the mind. For example, um,

619
00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:08.149
if to the degree large scale conflict has been

620
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.530
a long standing aspect of human psychology, we would

621
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.668
expect more design to avoid the cost of conflict

622
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:17.458
as well. Um, SO, um, oh, yeah, I'll just,

623
00:34:17.467 --> 00:34:18.489
I'll leave it at that. Yeah.

624
00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:23.360
Ok. Fair enough. So, but we've been talking uh,

625
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:28.958
here today and in our previous conversation about social

626
00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.290
groups or groups a lot. So, uh but do

627
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.010
we have a good understanding of what the human

628
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.899
mind is really representing when it represents a social

629
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:40.370
group?

630
00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.110
Yeah. No, the short answer is no, we don't.

631
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.889
Uh And, and really, I mean, if you even,

632
00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:46.918
you know, what is the human mind representing when

633
00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:50.129
it represents objects? Um Even that we don't really

634
00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.179
know, I mean, we have certain ideas about like

635
00:34:52.188 --> 00:34:55.590
early level perceptual things. But um once you start

636
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.239
thinking about, well, the rest of the mind has

637
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.889
to use an object representation. Um How does that

638
00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:02.810
work? It's still very, very uh difficult and we

639
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.989
still know very, very little. Um And so we're

640
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.870
in that same boat for something like a social

641
00:35:06.879 --> 00:35:08.389
group. I mean, one of the papers that I've

642
00:35:08.399 --> 00:35:11.129
done a B BS paper um and other people

643
00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:12.810
are doing things like this is to sort of

644
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.300
just start to take this question seriously about what

645
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:17.739
are the representations and this is based on a

646
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.459
long history and sort of cognitive science, for example,

647
00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:23.120
like people, people like um David Marr and Mar

648
00:35:23.129 --> 00:35:26.919
before Mar Marvin Minsky, um asking really what are

649
00:35:26.929 --> 00:35:31.459
the representations? And so um my contribution is a

650
00:35:31.469 --> 00:35:34.459
small little contribution, but it's a contribution to also

651
00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:36.139
just sort of say we need to start asking

652
00:35:36.149 --> 00:35:39.149
these kinds of questions. And so um what, what

653
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:43.889
the proposal is is that um there's something called

654
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.989
um the frame problem um in, in artificial intelligence

655
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.350
and cognitive science, which is sort of um an

656
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.860
event happens. Um And then um the question that

657
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.050
is faced is given event X, how has the

658
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.929
world changed? So what changes when event X happens?

659
00:36:01.939 --> 00:36:06.370
And so um that's not a trivial information processing

660
00:36:06.379 --> 00:36:09.409
problem for a robot or a human being. Um

661
00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:13.110
And so, um uh addressing that has been a

662
00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.120
long standing issue and there's no such thing as

663
00:36:15.129 --> 00:36:17.969
a general solution to that because it depends on

664
00:36:17.979 --> 00:36:20.889
um you know, uh um what domain you're talking

665
00:36:20.899 --> 00:36:24.709
about. So if I knock over your mother's priceless

666
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:28.219
antique vase, uh you know, for the physical system,

667
00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:29.830
what follows from that is there's a bunch of

668
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.010
glass on the ground, but for something like a

669
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.699
social system, um you are gonna start feeling differently

670
00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:38.030
about me. Um YOU might be angry at me,

671
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.149
other people need to represent sort of both of

672
00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:43.020
those things. So the physical system and the social

673
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.330
system you know, both need to be activated for

674
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.889
that for that kind of a thing. Um And

675
00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:51.800
so this issue of how do events change the

676
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.969
structure of the world? What is it, what is

677
00:36:53.979 --> 00:36:56.620
anticipated at time? Two, given an event at time,

678
00:36:56.629 --> 00:37:01.389
one is fundamental to group representation on this idea

679
00:37:01.399 --> 00:37:04.495
in my paper. And one idea is that what

680
00:37:04.504 --> 00:37:08.074
makes a group representation is not just a DTIC

681
00:37:08.084 --> 00:37:11.645
interaction where one agent interacts with another. So imposes

682
00:37:11.655 --> 00:37:14.155
a cost on, so a imposes a cost on

683
00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:18.024
B um that is just a diode interaction um

684
00:37:18.034 --> 00:37:20.645
or a, you know, gives a benefit to B

685
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.564
um that's still just a die interaction, it can

686
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:24.104
go back and forth but it's still just die.

687
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:27.540
Um And so a long standing issue has been

688
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.260
uh how do you get uh multi agent psychology

689
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:36.260
to scale up from um from die um things

690
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.600
and there's lots of species that have die reasoning

691
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.620
but don't have sort of group based reasoning. Um

692
00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:44.949
And so one idea is that really what changes

693
00:37:44.959 --> 00:37:48.340
is the involvement of a third agent. So um

694
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.010
if you and I, if you and I uh

695
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.340
are allies, you know, and somebody comes and hurts

696
00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.830
me, um You may react to that event of

697
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.149
somebody hurting me, even though you haven't been directly

698
00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:02.909
affected at all. It's an indirect social consequence. It's

699
00:38:02.919 --> 00:38:05.229
the term for it, it's an indirect social consequence.

700
00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:07.520
And so the fact that third parties can become

701
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.669
involved in a dieted conflict just by virtue of

702
00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:17.169
their background relationship with the, the die agents involved

703
00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:19.370
that um on this model is sort of the

704
00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:24.770
crucial difference between die and multi agent um representations.

705
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.770
And so the paper goes into details about um

706
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.979
for a conflict, what would a group representation be.

707
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.270
Um And so the sort of idea is that

708
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.939
there's only um four ways that a third party

709
00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:43.169
can be um drawn into a conflict. Um And

710
00:38:43.179 --> 00:38:44.750
we won't, I won't go through all the details

711
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.330
here. But basically, um the idea is that group

712
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.989
membership is the assignment of agents to particular roles

713
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.669
within those four tragic interaction types. And so, um

714
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.620
it's uh it's a, um it's an idea that

715
00:38:58.629 --> 00:39:01.030
what it means for something to be a group

716
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.350
is uh is an expectation of behaving in a

717
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.120
certain way in tria interactions where one agent is

718
00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:13.020
coming to the aid or attacking um another agent

719
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.260
uh because of some initial cost imposition, the same

720
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.899
model also applies to benefit conferral. Um Although we

721
00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:22.709
haven't published that work yet. Um And we've done

722
00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:25.889
some agent based modeling, Dan Conroy Beam. And I

723
00:39:25.899 --> 00:39:28.850
um on, if you kind of plug these rules

724
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.899
about roles and triads um into agent, into agents

725
00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:35.540
in a, in a Asian based model world, do

726
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.610
you get something like groups emerging? And in fact,

727
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.469
you do. So, um it's a partial answer to

728
00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:42.459
what is the mind representing when it represents a

729
00:39:42.469 --> 00:39:45.699
group. Um It's not complete um But it's a

730
00:39:45.709 --> 00:39:48.760
literal, uh as opposed to sort of metaphorical or

731
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.330
descriptive account because currently, um a lot of the

732
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.639
things that are talked about, which are accurate and

733
00:39:55.649 --> 00:39:58.979
valid, but they're not literal mechanistic descriptions. So something

734
00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:01.389
like, you know, these people belong to the scripts,

735
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.070
you sort of put them on a container and

736
00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.659
it's sort of left implicit. Well, what, what does

737
00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:08.820
it mean to assign agents to that container? Um

738
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.840
And when you start to have to flesh that

739
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.810
out mechanistically, as you would, for example, in building

740
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.520
a robot that can see and reason about groups

741
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.360
and understand groups. Um You realize that you actually

742
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:23.219
have to plug in these fairly strange um low

743
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.780
level um uh rules like, uh you know, if,

744
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.860
if you and I are friends and somebody comes

745
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.129
and hurts me, you're gonna come and hurt them

746
00:40:32.189 --> 00:40:34.229
if they hurt me. Um You know, so that

747
00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:38.429
kind of their literal um contingent behavioral uh reaction

748
00:40:38.439 --> 00:40:41.439
is something that's probably somewhere in the system. So

749
00:40:41.449 --> 00:40:44.320
that's, that's the example of the kind of thing

750
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.469
that the mind is representing when it represents a

751
00:40:46.479 --> 00:40:49.939
group. Um It's a behavior based uh framework.

752
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.830
Mhm. So you've also already mentioned there how having

753
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.070
an understanding of how we represent groups would apply

754
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.159
to the study of conflict. So, uh I have

755
00:41:02.169 --> 00:41:06.179
another kind of question here then that perhaps from

756
00:41:06.189 --> 00:41:10.550
a theoretical perspective is even uh deeper. So what

757
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:15.899
are cognitive processes? So we're always talking about cognitive

758
00:41:15.909 --> 00:41:20.969
processes, cognitive mechanism. So what are they exactly? And

759
00:41:20.979 --> 00:41:23.709
how do you think we should approach their study?

760
00:41:23.719 --> 00:41:28.550
Because you have also this very interesting paper where

761
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:34.989
you talk about integrating social ecological and evolutionary approaches

762
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.620
to a having a better understanding of what you

763
00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:43.250
call the instrumental nature of cognitive processes. So, could

764
00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.110
you explain that?

765
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.709
Sure. And it's not something that I just think

766
00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:48.590
too. I mean, you know, this is something that

767
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.919
is uh has been worked out on already. Um

768
00:41:52.929 --> 00:41:56.290
I would say, um and so, yeah, what do

769
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.959
you mean by a cognitive process? And I think

770
00:41:57.969 --> 00:42:00.000
the simple answer is, well, what do we already

771
00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.459
think of when we think about a process? Um

772
00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:05.199
WHEN we think about the body from the neck

773
00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:09.379
down? Right? Um So, and there's fairly simple things

774
00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:12.760
that follow um from just using that analogy that

775
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.510
quickly become nontrivial in the case of psychology and

776
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.840
pretty quickly diverged from what we are currently doing

777
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:23.290
in psychology. So, one of those things is, you

778
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.510
know, as a body you experience, well, like, you

779
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.449
know, I, I raise my hand because I want

780
00:42:27.459 --> 00:42:30.030
to, right? Um But I want to is not

781
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.100
a good explanation of, well, how does it work?

782
00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:35.229
Right. Um And uh so because, you know, if,

783
00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:37.120
if I can't raise my arm, what do you

784
00:42:37.129 --> 00:42:40.610
tell me? Well, try harder, Dave, you know, like

785
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.469
that you would not be a good doctor. Um

786
00:42:42.479 --> 00:42:44.540
If that was, if that was your explanation, you

787
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.030
know. So, so Dave tries to lift his arm

788
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.989
and, you know, one of those words isn't working,

789
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.270
you know, like Dave isn't working or, you know,

790
00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.600
the arm isn't working, that's fine. That's an explanation

791
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.620
of it. But um at some level, but it's

792
00:42:55.629 --> 00:42:58.840
not an adequate mechanistic understanding. It's certainly not the

793
00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.860
kind of thing you would be satisfied with if

794
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.520
you wanted to go in and fix the fact

795
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.780
that I couldn't lift my arm, for example. So

796
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.189
you need an idea that, well, um there's this

797
00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:13.199
intuitive experience of sort of unity that there's an

798
00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:15.719
agent who wants to do things who believes things,

799
00:43:15.729 --> 00:43:17.840
you know, this is something that people call our

800
00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:20.800
intuitive theory of mind or um Dan Dennett talks

801
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.659
about this is the intentional stance. Um And he

802
00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:25.810
works and I have a paper about modularity where

803
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.659
we talk about this is the intentional level of

804
00:43:27.669 --> 00:43:29.629
analysis in all cases, it's just sort of this

805
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:32.919
highest level everyday intuitive way of thinking about people

806
00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:35.310
as agents and what they want, what they believe.

807
00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.570
And it's fine. It's correct in the sense of

808
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.919
it describes, you know, Dave wants to raise his

809
00:43:40.929 --> 00:43:43.949
hand, that's why he raised his hand. Um But

810
00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:46.919
in the same way, if we want to understand,

811
00:43:46.929 --> 00:43:49.429
well, how did I raise my hand again from

812
00:43:49.439 --> 00:43:52.669
the neck down? We understand there's lots of systems

813
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:56.649
and so Dave still exists. But Dave, if you

814
00:43:56.659 --> 00:43:58.929
go down a level, we break Dave up into

815
00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:01.659
lots of different systems with lots of different functions.

816
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.580
Um, AND what you wanna do is you want

817
00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:08.919
to have an adequate account of how I raise

818
00:44:08.929 --> 00:44:11.270
my hand. You don't worry about. Well, we're only

819
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.350
gonna let there be three systems. Right. We don't

820
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.399
even really worry about where does one system start

821
00:44:16.409 --> 00:44:19.370
in one system end? We don't worry so much

822
00:44:19.379 --> 00:44:22.479
about, you know, um uh does it feel hard

823
00:44:22.489 --> 00:44:24.120
to raise my hand or not? So, there's all

824
00:44:24.129 --> 00:44:29.169
these sort of like, um uh things kind of

825
00:44:29.179 --> 00:44:30.969
in the way of just getting to the simple

826
00:44:30.979 --> 00:44:32.699
fact of the matter of, well, there has to

827
00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.909
be like mechanical stuff inside the body that makes

828
00:44:35.919 --> 00:44:38.729
it possible for there to be this thing where

829
00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:40.919
Dave wants to raise his hand and is able

830
00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:43.899
to raise his hand. Um And so, well, how

831
00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:45.550
do those work? Well, and you look at the

832
00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.310
history of physiology and the history is very interesting

833
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.489
because, um not to too, too long, but aggression,

834
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.090
but people had access to physical bodies for as

835
00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.770
long as people have been around and scientifically, you

836
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.260
know, for a very long time, if you look

837
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.679
at, um, it's very interesting to look at the

838
00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:05.090
history of physiology. So you look at something like,

839
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.489
you know, fifth century physiologists, um like Galen. Um

840
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.949
THEY'RE, they're talking about like mechanisms like moisture darkness.

841
00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:16.929
Um You can kind of see that they have

842
00:45:16.939 --> 00:45:18.929
an idea that they need to apply function to

843
00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:21.350
the body. Um But they're not doing things like

844
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.860
nephridial, right? Or like uh uh or microtubules or,

845
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:30.360
or things that are um really detailed descriptions of

846
00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.510
functions and sub functions in the body. Um And

847
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.040
the point of saying that is, you can't just

848
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.080
look at the physical system and infer the function

849
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.169
you need some idea of what's the broader context

850
00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:45.739
in which this thing is, is is operating. Um

851
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.929
And so when we talk about um well, Dave

852
00:45:48.939 --> 00:45:51.610
lifts his arm, right? And is able to and

853
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.820
wants to um there is a physical level description,

854
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.409
that's the, that's the physical stance. Um As Annie

855
00:45:59.419 --> 00:46:01.719
Wertz and I talk about it, that's the implementation

856
00:46:01.729 --> 00:46:05.310
level of analysis. But there's also this middle functional

857
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.550
level, this is the the functional level where that

858
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.080
was what allowed physiology to become uh a progressing

859
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.959
science where people realize, well, the function of the

860
00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:17.550
heart is to pump blood. And all of a

861
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.669
sudden all the uh material things they were looking

862
00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:24.010
at why they were structured, the way they were

863
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.169
made sense and even the way they saw the

864
00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:29.020
material things changed, right? They understood this thing was

865
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.300
not just incidental, it was a pump and the

866
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.820
fact that it was moist was incidental, the fact

867
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.495
that it was dark incidental. So the units of

868
00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:41.635
function changed. Um And so just as uh so

869
00:46:41.645 --> 00:46:44.524
for the case of raising my arm, we need

870
00:46:44.534 --> 00:46:48.104
a middle functional level description of, you know, various

871
00:46:48.114 --> 00:46:52.554
systems that execute certain functions about arm position um

872
00:46:52.564 --> 00:46:56.034
about um planning system. So what it means that

873
00:46:56.044 --> 00:46:59.334
I wanted to is there's some representation and some

874
00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:04.360
system about the location of the limb um representation

875
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.830
of a future state of the limb that corresponds

876
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.020
to lifting, right. And then there has to be

877
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:13.250
some system that takes that representation and translates it

878
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.929
into a series of electrochemical signals that eventually lead

879
00:47:17.939 --> 00:47:21.820
to muscles moving the arm. That's a, that's really

880
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.090
nontrivial. Um If you wanted to build a robot

881
00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.439
that could do that, it would take you a

882
00:47:25.449 --> 00:47:29.709
while, but it's that middle abstract functional level. Um

883
00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:32.370
THAT'S also really important. And so you have three

884
00:47:32.379 --> 00:47:33.969
levels at the end of the day, you've got

885
00:47:34.629 --> 00:47:37.570
the intuitive intentional level. Dave wants to raise his

886
00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.979
arm, he's able to, you can look down at

887
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:43.709
the meet the implementation level. Um AND you can

888
00:47:43.719 --> 00:47:47.179
look at this middle functional level and exactly. So

889
00:47:47.189 --> 00:47:49.449
that's all of that is the preamble to the

890
00:47:49.459 --> 00:47:51.340
simple answer then which is you do the exact

891
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.689
same thing with mental processes. You say, look, you

892
00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:57.580
know, people believe things, they wanna do things, uh

893
00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:00.060
they intend to do things. But there's a level

894
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:04.179
of description that is above the the meat in

895
00:48:04.189 --> 00:48:06.719
the mind, you know, the neurons and the electrochemical

896
00:48:06.729 --> 00:48:10.580
signals that's this functional level description and it's of

897
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.010
systems and you don't worry about how many there

898
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.780
are, there could be billions, there could be three.

899
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.449
You don't worry about that. You just try to

900
00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:20.570
say, well, what are all the mechanical steps that

901
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.699
would be required? And at every point, the point

902
00:48:23.709 --> 00:48:28.320
is you try to expand on what is currently

903
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.939
known into more and more detail. Um And so

904
00:48:31.949 --> 00:48:37.250
there's a big long history and psychology um of

905
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.590
avoiding that middle level because it's not intuitive. Um

906
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.110
It's also controversial. Um And people like to have

907
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.409
evidence about things. Um And it's the level that

908
00:48:47.419 --> 00:48:49.389
has the least evidence because in a lot of

909
00:48:49.399 --> 00:48:52.149
cases, you have to speculate about what the abstract

910
00:48:52.159 --> 00:48:55.110
functions are before you go looking for them. Um

911
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.870
As uh Marvin Minsky put it, you can't um

912
00:48:57.919 --> 00:48:59.899
look for something till you have the idea of

913
00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:02.229
it. Um And I think a lot of the

914
00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:05.590
history of psychology and cognitive science has been hindered

915
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.489
because um of what G Gert Geens would call

916
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.510
defensive theorizing, which is, it's very easy to avoid

917
00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:19.159
um making claims at that middle level. Um uh

918
00:49:19.169 --> 00:49:22.399
It's easier to just talk about what physically exists.

919
00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:24.679
It's easier to just talk about behavior, it's easier

920
00:49:24.689 --> 00:49:29.810
to talk about the intentional level. Um And because

921
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.100
it's difficult to um operate at that middle level,

922
00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.879
there's a lot of uncertainty. Um It's also easy

923
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:39.330
to glom onto distinctions that may not matter very

924
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.909
much. So, for example, is there one system or

925
00:49:41.919 --> 00:49:44.689
two systems, you know, or is a system completely

926
00:49:44.699 --> 00:49:47.830
isolated from another system? Um You know, you would

927
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.360
never uh start off asking how does a body

928
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:55.310
work or how does a car work um by,

929
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.629
by really glomming onto there have to be two

930
00:49:57.639 --> 00:50:01.310
systems or we have to show, you know, 90%

931
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.260
degree of isolation for us to count these two

932
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.939
things as being separate systems. Like those are sort

933
00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:08.899
of backwards ways of doing it. You just don't

934
00:50:08.909 --> 00:50:10.800
worry about that and you say, well, what are

935
00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:12.500
the functions? What would they, what would it have

936
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.500
to be? Um And so anyway, that's um I'm

937
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.239
going on and on, but basically, the history of

938
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.879
psychology is sort of um interesting. Um It's deeply

939
00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:27.090
interesting um and it's all um repeating the history

940
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.850
of physiology here where that middle abstract level is

941
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:34.090
crucial. It's very difficult and it's kind of being

942
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.429
um uh it's emerging towards the end of what

943
00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:41.459
has been a very um productive century and a

944
00:50:41.469 --> 00:50:45.620
half of science, but it's still uh not very

945
00:50:45.629 --> 00:50:51.429
um established um despite um um despite that century

946
00:50:51.439 --> 00:50:52.179
and a half. Yeah.

947
00:50:53.479 --> 00:50:56.350
So uh please correct me if I'm wrong. But,

948
00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.070
but a a as you were explaining all of

949
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.739
that one thing that came to my mind is

950
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.530
if all of that would connect in any way

951
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:10.879
or relate in any way with discussions surrounding a

952
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.070
free will beca I mean, I'm asking you that

953
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.370
for several reasons, one of them was uh because

954
00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:21.209
when it came to the part where you mentioned,

955
00:51:21.469 --> 00:51:24.909
oh, I want to do something, I want to

956
00:51:24.919 --> 00:51:27.550
raise my arm or something like that. I mean,

957
00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:32.060
that, that sort of level of cognitive A AAA

958
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:36.270
G control that we have. I mean, in a

959
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.129
way reminds me of debate surrounding free will. Then

960
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:43.949
the, the second reason is that just uh earlier

961
00:51:43.959 --> 00:51:48.439
this year, two very interesting books came out when

962
00:51:48.449 --> 00:51:51.310
by Kevin Mitchell and the other by Robert Sapolsky,

963
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.760
arguing from two opposite sides from an evolutionary and

964
00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:00.120
biological and neuroscientific perspective about free will. And also,

965
00:52:00.129 --> 00:52:03.709
I mean, you told me that you're working with

966
00:52:03.719 --> 00:52:06.939
Christian List, right? The previous guest on the show

967
00:52:06.949 --> 00:52:09.280
as well. He has a very interesting book on

968
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.540
Free Will on that issue. So, I, I mean,

969
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.580
would, would there be a connection here or

970
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.280
not? Yeah, the argument here. Yeah. The, the paper

971
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.750
is with Christian List and Thomas Hills and we're,

972
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.649
we're, we're quickly trying to get it out. So,

973
00:52:23.659 --> 00:52:25.659
um I'll sort of brief allude to it. I

974
00:52:25.669 --> 00:52:29.379
mean, the bottom line is that um the argument

975
00:52:29.389 --> 00:52:32.739
is that um free will is real. Um BUT

976
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.879
it's mechanical. So, so, uh so, so uh so

977
00:52:37.889 --> 00:52:39.399
I can unpack that a little bit. So the

978
00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:41.780
idea is that when you say something like, you

979
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.590
know, I want to um raise my arm and

980
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.320
I'm free to do so. Um THAT is a

981
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.649
representation of an evolved organism. And you want to

982
00:52:51.659 --> 00:52:53.919
ask the question, what is that evolved organism mean?

983
00:52:53.929 --> 00:52:55.620
When it's saying it's free to move its arm.

984
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.610
And the argument is that um what it means

985
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.830
that I'm free to do something is essentially that

986
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.649
um um nobody is coercing me. So you didn't,

987
00:53:07.659 --> 00:53:09.370
you know, put a gun to my head, right?

988
00:53:09.379 --> 00:53:12.409
So I did, it means that you weren't forcing

989
00:53:12.419 --> 00:53:14.620
me to do it. It also means something like,

990
00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:17.689
you know, maybe, you know, my arm gets injured,

991
00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:21.850
right? And I can't control it anymore. So, um

992
00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:24.520
so that's another situation where I no longer have

993
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:28.280
free freedom or the use of my arm, right?

994
00:53:28.669 --> 00:53:33.530
So from the perspective and evolve organism, the body

995
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.260
um that it's composed of and sort of its

996
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:40.399
planning mechanisms, its representational systems, there would be selection

997
00:53:40.409 --> 00:53:46.909
to represent um its own ability to um determine

998
00:53:46.919 --> 00:53:49.489
what it's gonna do in the future. So, and

999
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.830
there's just some things that it has, it has

1000
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.959
more or less of that ability to do. So

1001
00:53:54.969 --> 00:53:57.929
if you hold a gun to my head, it's

1002
00:53:57.939 --> 00:54:02.810
my planning representational systems matter less because you've constrained

1003
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.689
my options because of the strong cost benefit nature

1004
00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:09.689
of that. Um So for example, you know, I

1005
00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:14.320
can't, I'm not going nothing I do um about

1006
00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.580
sort of ruminating about, well, what should I have

1007
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.429
done in the future? Um There's no way for

1008
00:54:19.439 --> 00:54:23.020
my information processing systems to intervene in that kind

1009
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:27.229
of situation, right? Um The, the, the, the point

1010
00:54:27.239 --> 00:54:32.110
of maximum difference in whether or not I do

1011
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.070
the behavior is to get you and the gun

1012
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.280
off of my head, right? Um That's sort of

1013
00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:40.020
the point of maximum intervention. So you want, if

1014
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:42.020
you want to change the outcome, you change the

1015
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:44.709
point, the gun at my head, not, you know,

1016
00:54:44.719 --> 00:54:48.800
my my planning systems, um same thing with a

1017
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.729
broken arm. So if I can't use my arm

1018
00:54:51.739 --> 00:54:54.489
because it's broken, you can't coerce me to like

1019
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.300
use my arm, I can't will my way to

1020
00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.500
use my broken arm, right? Like it's just broken,

1021
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:01.409
we have to just let it heal. And so

1022
00:55:01.419 --> 00:55:04.500
the idea is that in our everyday intuitive folk

1023
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.929
psychology, we have a representation of agency. And that's

1024
00:55:08.939 --> 00:55:14.100
specifically because agents can um make decisions and we

1025
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.290
can intervene on agents, whether it's other agents or

1026
00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:22.639
ourselves by changing the state of certain planning systems,

1027
00:55:22.649 --> 00:55:27.889
certain motivational systems, um that's all coherent. Um But

1028
00:55:27.899 --> 00:55:30.169
then there are some aspects of the world that

1029
00:55:30.179 --> 00:55:35.139
those planning uh representational changes can affect, like holding

1030
00:55:35.149 --> 00:55:37.590
the gun to my head or um the broken

1031
00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.530
arm. And so the idea is that um to

1032
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.969
put it pretty simply the intentional system or the

1033
00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:48.070
intentional level has a slot for an agency and

1034
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.909
then a slot for a mechanism and the agency

1035
00:55:50.919 --> 00:55:54.050
and the mechanism are two different things. Um And

1036
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.649
so things that I'm free to do are sort

1037
00:55:57.659 --> 00:55:59.610
of things that go in the agency slot, you

1038
00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.649
know, like I'm free to, like, decide to wake

1039
00:56:01.659 --> 00:56:04.139
up early in the morning or not. Um I'm

1040
00:56:04.149 --> 00:56:06.199
not free, like, I don't have free will to

1041
00:56:06.209 --> 00:56:10.149
sort of, um, you know, um, um, you know,

1042
00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:12.719
will my arm into being not broken, right. So

1043
00:56:12.729 --> 00:56:14.969
that goes in the mechanism slot. And so the

1044
00:56:14.979 --> 00:56:18.919
idea is that um where the idea of free

1045
00:56:18.929 --> 00:56:23.229
will comes from is this idea of distinguishing between

1046
00:56:23.239 --> 00:56:30.639
those situations where interventions of, of treating an agent

1047
00:56:30.649 --> 00:56:34.409
like an intentional being, like changing motivations, changing desires,

1048
00:56:34.419 --> 00:56:38.800
beliefs are effective or not. And when they're effective,

1049
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:40.810
it goes in the agency slot. When they're not

1050
00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.409
effective, it goes in the mechanism slot. And so

1051
00:56:43.419 --> 00:56:49.030
that intentional level system views agency and mechanism as

1052
00:56:49.199 --> 00:56:52.679
c as in as um as mutually exclusive, right?

1053
00:56:52.689 --> 00:56:54.800
What it means that something is an agent or

1054
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:58.000
is free means that it's not mechanical, right? It's

1055
00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.979
not just billiard ball causation. And uh the argument

1056
00:57:01.989 --> 00:57:05.600
with Christian list and Thomas Hills um is that,

1057
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.209
that's a psychological explanation for where incompatibility comes from.

1058
00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:14.070
So incompatible is the idea that free will and

1059
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.189
determinism are not compatible with one another. Um Of

1060
00:57:18.199 --> 00:57:21.070
course, it's complicated because, you know, it's, this has

1061
00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.139
been a long standing um debate for, for as

1062
00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:25.959
long as there's been recorded history, the need for

1063
00:57:25.969 --> 00:57:28.159
free will so it'll take like a couple more

1064
00:57:28.169 --> 00:57:31.000
minutes to to unpack it. But basically the other

1065
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:33.800
part is um we were just talking about this

1066
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:37.600
middle functional level, right? The functional level analysis, abstract

1067
00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:41.159
function. And that unlike what we were just talking

1068
00:57:41.169 --> 00:57:44.550
about a second ago is probably driven by something

1069
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.510
like an evolved artifact psychology. So it's sort of

1070
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.500
saying, you know, you're just treating people like robots,

1071
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:52.669
right? You're saying, look, the person has a bunch

1072
00:57:52.679 --> 00:57:56.050
of software, it's like abstract if then rules that

1073
00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.979
was sort of turing's point, right? Like you can

1074
00:57:57.989 --> 00:58:01.139
just any computational system can be described as like

1075
00:58:01.149 --> 00:58:04.110
a complicated set of contingent rules that are abstract.

1076
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:09.010
Um And so that artifact system views everything that

1077
00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:14.330
people do as a bunch of software. So, um

1078
00:58:14.629 --> 00:58:18.169
and in that sense, so Dave decides to um

1079
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.370
pick up his arm and he can, I'm free

1080
00:58:20.379 --> 00:58:23.419
to use my arm from the perspective of the

1081
00:58:23.429 --> 00:58:26.669
artifact system, from the perspective of this functional level

1082
00:58:26.679 --> 00:58:32.189
of analysis. Everything you do is deterministic, right? Or

1083
00:58:32.199 --> 00:58:35.729
it's mechanical and we can put aside determinism for

1084
00:58:35.739 --> 00:58:39.320
a second, but just say it's mechanical. Um So

1085
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:45.419
from the artifact system uh mechanism and free will

1086
00:58:45.429 --> 00:58:48.310
are not incompatible with each other, right? So, in

1087
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.020
fact, in order to be free, in order for

1088
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.979
a robot to say, hey, look, I'm free to

1089
00:58:52.989 --> 00:58:56.100
do this, that's actually a bunch of mechanical steps.

1090
00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:59.409
It's a representation of what we just talked about.

1091
00:58:59.419 --> 00:59:02.010
Which is, the robot is representing, it has not

1092
00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.770
been coerced, right? Um That, uh, it can change

1093
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.770
this outcome if it were to, for example, um,

1094
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.300
have a different, um, waiting of something like, you

1095
00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.699
know, costs in the future, you know, so like

1096
00:59:16.709 --> 00:59:18.139
I'm free to change when I wake up in

1097
00:59:18.149 --> 00:59:21.070
the morning. Um, AND what that means is I

1098
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.060
can represent that if I want to get more

1099
00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:26.860
work done, I'm gonna have to sort of, you

1100
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:30.060
know, do something differently. I can, you know, I

1101
00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.810
can make a plan about how to do that,

1102
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.790
right? And so that's all mechanical steps when I

1103
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.860
say that it's all mechanical steps. So you have

1104
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:40.399
one system, the artifact system, the functional level of

1105
00:59:40.409 --> 00:59:44.840
analysis treating free will as mechanical. So that's compatible.

1106
00:59:44.979 --> 00:59:47.280
So there's this long history of people having a

1107
00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:49.879
compatible list intuition about free will that free will

1108
00:59:49.889 --> 00:59:54.679
and determinism or mechanical world um are consistent with

1109
00:59:54.689 --> 00:59:57.800
one another. But then that's con contrasted with the

1110
00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.699
output of our theory of mind system, the intentional

1111
01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:05.080
level where free will and mechanism are completely opposed

1112
01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:08.100
to one another. And so our argument in this

1113
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.469
paper, it's sort of an argument is we have

1114
01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:12.310
the, we, we have the, it's the meta problem

1115
01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.120
of free will. Why does anybody think there's a

1116
01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.939
problem of free will to begin with? And this

1117
01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:18.100
is sort of borrowing from the meta problem of

1118
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.370
consciousness, right? Why do people think there's a problem

1119
01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:23.020
of consciousness to begin with. And the argument is

1120
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:27.010
that you have two different onto or two different

1121
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.459
evolved systems for carving up the world. One is

1122
01:00:29.469 --> 01:00:32.110
viewing the world in terms of agency and it's

1123
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.899
agency that's inconsistent with mechanism. Then there's another system

1124
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.850
that is just viewing the world as everything is

1125
01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.899
a mechanism. And those are two different systems that

1126
01:00:43.909 --> 01:00:46.899
can be going on inside of our heads at

1127
01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:49.979
the same time, maybe they're stronger in 11 system

1128
01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:52.229
is stronger in some people than in other people,

1129
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.949
but they give completely conflicting, um, uh outputs in

1130
01:00:56.959 --> 01:01:00.550
terms of the compatibility between free will and, and

1131
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.879
mechanical slash deterministic systems. Um And the argument is

1132
01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:08.729
that, that's probably the psychology underlying this, this whole

1133
01:01:08.739 --> 01:01:11.800
free will debate and why it feels like free

1134
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.840
will is a paradox because I don't know about

1135
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.899
you Ricardo. But even me, sometimes I wake up

1136
01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:18.139
in the morning and I'm like, I feel like

1137
01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:20.719
more of a compatible and sometimes, you know, late

1138
01:01:20.729 --> 01:01:22.560
at night, I feel like less of a, less

1139
01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:24.189
of a compatible list. I mean, you know, even

1140
01:01:24.199 --> 01:01:27.459
within the same person in, in, there's nice work,

1141
01:01:27.469 --> 01:01:30.189
um, empirical work being done on, you know, examining

1142
01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:33.239
to what degree people are or aren't. Um, AND

1143
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:35.879
it's important. Um, AND, and we're finding out a

1144
01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:39.729
lot, but basically, um, the argument is that this

1145
01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:41.729
is an example of where we've had this long

1146
01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:45.250
standing philosophical issue. But we can actually describe the

1147
01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.639
psychology of where it's coming from, you know, where

1148
01:01:47.649 --> 01:01:50.760
the psychology is coming from is essentially that we

1149
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:54.260
have two different evolved systems that are following different

1150
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:59.350
rules and they're output conflicting answers about the same

1151
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.419
question essentially. And that's, that's a perfect recipe for

1152
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.280
um uh for having something that feels paradoxical or

1153
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.120
unsolvable. And so the answer actually is that the,

1154
01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:13.280
the, the way out of the philosophical problem is

1155
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:17.728
to understand the psychological mechanisms, understand their logic. Such

1156
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:20.827
that one can understand why there feels like a

1157
01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:24.028
paradox, why it doesn't feel unanswerable. There's a few

1158
01:02:24.038 --> 01:02:25.627
more details and we'll save some of those for

1159
01:02:25.637 --> 01:02:28.528
the paper. But that's, but that's, that's the answer

1160
01:02:28.538 --> 01:02:29.718
to the free will problem.

1161
01:02:30.028 --> 01:02:32.708
No, no. That, that's really fascinating. And by the

1162
01:02:32.718 --> 01:02:35.718
way, if you're open to it, uh whenever the

1163
01:02:35.728 --> 01:02:38.127
paper is out next year or so, I would

1164
01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:40.248
love to have you back on the show also

1165
01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:44.355
with Doctor Christian List. Uh BECAUSE uh it seems

1166
01:02:44.365 --> 01:02:48.186
really fascinating and I've had my own journey when

1167
01:02:48.196 --> 01:02:50.956
it comes to free will because up until late

1168
01:02:50.966 --> 01:02:54.006
2020 I was a full-blown determinist. But then I

1169
01:02:54.016 --> 01:02:57.025
read Doctor List's book and I read him on

1170
01:02:57.035 --> 01:02:59.635
the show and I was like, OK, so perhaps

1171
01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.395
there are a few things that I have to

1172
01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:04.595
consider here. So he was one of the first

1173
01:03:04.674 --> 01:03:09.914
people that actually help, helped me deconvert from the

1174
01:03:09.924 --> 01:03:14.783
Church of the Truth. And and then now more

1175
01:03:14.793 --> 01:03:18.053
recently with Kevin Mitchell's book and a few other

1176
01:03:18.063 --> 01:03:21.404
people I thought with, uh, I mean, I have

1177
01:03:21.414 --> 01:03:25.174
at least a more nuanced view of free will.

1178
01:03:25.184 --> 01:03:27.763
I, I, I'm not sure. I, I'm still not

1179
01:03:27.773 --> 01:03:33.382
completely sure if, uh, with the degree we have

1180
01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:36.781
free will, let's say. But, yeah, I'm more sold

1181
01:03:36.872 --> 01:03:37.481
on it now.

1182
01:03:37.912 --> 01:03:39.681
Yeah, I think it's, it's also, I mean, to

1183
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:42.011
be clear too, like, I don't think in this

1184
01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:45.642
paper, I don't think either side of the debate

1185
01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:49.392
is, is um, is guiltless or, or there's sort

1186
01:03:49.402 --> 01:03:51.231
of corrections on both sides because you can say

1187
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.850
sort of, well, it's free will and illusion. And

1188
01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.189
there's a version of which that there is, that's

1189
01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:59.149
right and wrong just very briefly. One version is,

1190
01:03:59.209 --> 01:04:01.489
if you think that the way of the mechanical

1191
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.300
system works is at some point there's like a

1192
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:06.959
little ghost that's sort of like doing something non

1193
01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.729
material, then that's wrong, right? If that's what you

1194
01:04:09.739 --> 01:04:12.409
think free will, it means we have free will.

1195
01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.189
But the argument is that that was never a

1196
01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:17.729
coherent understanding of what free will is to begin

1197
01:04:17.739 --> 01:04:20.570
with. The idea is that what's a coherent and

1198
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.370
representation of what free will? Is it something like

1199
01:04:23.379 --> 01:04:25.459
what I talked about earlier, which is, it's a

1200
01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:28.689
mechanical system whose job is for an evolved work

1201
01:04:29.034 --> 01:04:33.364
to basically assess what is, what is the um

1202
01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:36.364
what are the kind of events that uh give

1203
01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:40.604
me the maximum uh leverage uh for future interventions

1204
01:04:40.614 --> 01:04:43.604
is this a situation where I can change outcomes

1205
01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:48.429
by changing um motivation planning systems inside me inside

1206
01:04:48.439 --> 01:04:52.790
other people, by convincing them talking to them. Or

1207
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.379
is this something where that's not possible? It's just

1208
01:04:55.389 --> 01:04:59.989
like a broken bone, right? Um And so that's

1209
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.280
what the free will representation is. If that's what

1210
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:05.810
you understand the free will representation to be, then

1211
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.770
yes, we have it. But if you understood free

1212
01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.719
will, having free will to mean there's a ghost

1213
01:05:11.729 --> 01:05:15.479
that pokes on the mechanical systems at the functional

1214
01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:17.750
level of analysis, then we don't have it. So

1215
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.510
it's like many of these things where we just

1216
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.669
have to unpack it just a little bit more.

1217
01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:24.300
Um Otherwise, if you just say is free will

1218
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:26.469
real or not, you can have an endless debate

1219
01:05:26.479 --> 01:05:28.350
because what you mean by free will, what the

1220
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.330
sides mean in that is in that issue um

1221
01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.510
is um is unclear. Um There's also an evolutionary

1222
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.969
mismatch just very briefly. Um That, that's the final

1223
01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:40.989
part that's sort of, I think fueling the confusion,

1224
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.929
which is that we never evolved in a world

1225
01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:47.340
where we could know all the mechanical steps in

1226
01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:51.709
our mind. So, in that sense, knowing that science

1227
01:05:51.719 --> 01:05:55.870
can give us a purely billiard ball, mechanical um

1228
01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:59.040
description of how we do everything that's not something

1229
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.610
our mind have ever evolved to deal with. So,

1230
01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.379
in other words, from an evolution perspective the idea

1231
01:06:04.389 --> 01:06:07.139
that everything can be placed in the mechanism slot

1232
01:06:07.149 --> 01:06:09.949
in, out of the agency slot, even in theory,

1233
01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:13.659
right? For the intentional system is an evolutionary novelty.

1234
01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:17.000
And so I think rightly so people sort of

1235
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:21.239
feel worried about that, right? Because if I'm mechanical

1236
01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.399
from an of all being perspective, like you can

1237
01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:25.459
manipulate me, right? There's all these examples of like

1238
01:06:25.469 --> 01:06:28.280
neuroscientists coming in and like doing stuff and that's

1239
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:31.060
true, right? Like we are mechanical. So like everything

1240
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.709
we do in principle could be manipulated and that's

1241
01:06:34.719 --> 01:06:37.639
a reasonable concern for an evolved organism. So the

1242
01:06:37.649 --> 01:06:41.239
i the concern that free will goes away um

1243
01:06:41.629 --> 01:06:45.530
isn't crazy from this perspective of this evolved system,

1244
01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.770
from the the perspective of this evolved um concern

1245
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.129
about manipulation. So again, the the point is um

1246
01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:58.479
we can understand uh conceptually why everybody is taking

1247
01:06:58.489 --> 01:07:00.840
the position they're taking, we can understand even the

1248
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.320
misunderstanding and we can understand the motivations behind it.

1249
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.399
So the answer is there's not a single answer,

1250
01:07:07.409 --> 01:07:09.939
it's just that there's a lot of pieces and

1251
01:07:09.949 --> 01:07:11.850
people were sort of talking at each other from

1252
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.739
cross purposes. And at the end of the day,

1253
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.699
we still don't want people to be manipulated. Um

1254
01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:18.600
But, you know, if we learn enough about how

1255
01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.820
the mind works, if stuff's broken, we can fix

1256
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.030
it, for example. Uh But these are the issues

1257
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.899
of like, you know, when we're done with psychology,

1258
01:07:24.909 --> 01:07:26.939
what are the implications? And we're still a long

1259
01:07:26.949 --> 01:07:28.449
way off from that. So, yeah,

1260
01:07:28.979 --> 01:07:33.770
great. So, let's talk now about uh David Pins

1261
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.310
off and Marty Eelin S paper on their alliance

1262
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.000
theory of political belief systems. I mean, I'm asking

1263
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:43.929
you about this, the reason is that you've commented

1264
01:07:43.939 --> 01:07:49.229
on it. So, uh and um I mean, basically

1265
01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.939
I have two different questions to ask you. So

1266
01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:57.560
if, if they're right with their argument, what do

1267
01:07:57.570 --> 01:08:01.500
you think would be the challenges to current political

1268
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:05.080
science and political psychology that would stem from

1269
01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:06.899
it? Yeah. Well, and I want to start up

1270
01:08:06.909 --> 01:08:09.120
by saying, um you know, I'm not, I, I

1271
01:08:09.129 --> 01:08:12.530
have a foot in political psychology, but I'm certainly,

1272
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.929
it's not my area of expertise. Um And so

1273
01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:17.990
I want to uh qualify everything I say with

1274
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.169
that. Um um THEIR argument just to sort of

1275
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.689
recapitulate for people who may not be familiar with

1276
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:29.419
it is that there's been a long history in

1277
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:33.459
the behavioral sciences and particularly political science, um political

1278
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:39.470
psychology to look at um partisanship from the perspective

1279
01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:43.359
of ideologies. So, um so from a us perspective,

1280
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:46.069
for example, you know, Republicans and Democrats, they just

1281
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.819
hold different ideologies. So certain ideologies like, you know,

1282
01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:56.390
concern about um fairness, um concern about um you

1283
01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:00.819
know, um um the sanctity of life, for example,

1284
01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:04.870
um or um the sanctity of um you know,

1285
01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:07.879
not starving to death, like those kinds of things.

1286
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:12.020
So like kind of abstract principles. Um THEIR argument

1287
01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:14.470
is that sort of been the currency of theorizing

1288
01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:19.229
in political science um in political psychology. Um And

1289
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.120
what they do in this paper is they basically

1290
01:09:21.129 --> 01:09:23.680
just say, well, look, if you take this ideology

1291
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.410
principle based perspective and you really look at, well,

1292
01:09:26.419 --> 01:09:30.798
what are the policies that, um, people are supporting

1293
01:09:30.898 --> 01:09:34.438
or not supporting? It? Sort of doesn't, um, it

1294
01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:37.389
doesn't quite work, right. So, um, and this is

1295
01:09:37.398 --> 01:09:41.788
something that a lot of political satire and commentary

1296
01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:43.979
sort of traffics in which is to say, well,

1297
01:09:43.988 --> 01:09:48.350
look, you know, if you um really think life

1298
01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:51.740
is very precious, then like, what's your attitude about

1299
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.330
war? Right. Um So, you know, if you're anti

1300
01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:57.310
abortion because you think life is precious. Well, what

1301
01:09:57.319 --> 01:10:00.740
about sending people off to war? Um More pointedly,

1302
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.229
people point out um Well, what about like, you

1303
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.270
know, fertility clinics, but that also kill a lot

1304
01:10:05.279 --> 01:10:07.370
of embryos, like, are you for that as well?

1305
01:10:07.379 --> 01:10:11.209
Right. Are you for um um are you for

1306
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.209
um uh you know, uh prophylactic? So, birth control

1307
01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.740
contraception that will prevent um unwanted death as well.

1308
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.970
And if you sort of, and in this, the

1309
01:10:21.979 --> 01:10:24.450
argument, the pins off argument is that this applies

1310
01:10:24.459 --> 01:10:26.709
broadly. This is not just, you know, anti aortic

1311
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.970
attitudes that if you really push on the attitude

1312
01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:32.189
and you say, well, what would, again, we can

1313
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.430
do a thing of like, if there was a

1314
01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:37.129
robot that actually was the program was, you know,

1315
01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:42.189
protect life, what attitudes, opinions, policies would it support?

1316
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.950
And if you follow that logic versus what do

1317
01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:47.939
people actually do those things look very different. And

1318
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:52.910
so their argument is that, um, ideologies, even many

1319
01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:57.390
principles are sort of a readout of a much

1320
01:10:57.399 --> 01:11:01.279
more, sort of complicated, but in another way, simple,

1321
01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.290
um, sort of as we talked about, sort of

1322
01:11:03.299 --> 01:11:06.069
an alliance psychology where people sort of look out

1323
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.120
in the world, look at what are their interests,

1324
01:11:09.129 --> 01:11:13.390
what norms are serving their interests. Um We can

1325
01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:15.189
unpack that a little bit because that's one of

1326
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.870
the issues with their idea. But basically, their idea

1327
01:11:17.879 --> 01:11:24.600
is that um uh interests of people are um

1328
01:11:24.609 --> 01:11:29.609
what's driving the content of ideologies. And so what

1329
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.899
people are usually expressing when they're talking about ideologies

1330
01:11:34.069 --> 01:11:40.609
is a content that continues to support the growing

1331
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:44.879
rights or protections of the people that people sort

1332
01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.979
of treat as their allies or people that they're

1333
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:51.120
concerned about. Um And so this is the sort

1334
01:11:51.129 --> 01:11:54.060
of pins off argument is that ideologies are sort

1335
01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:57.859
of instrumental. Um And they call it, you know,

1336
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.240
propaganda basically from the perspective of uh an objective

1337
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.669
uh outside uh maybe objective, but we'll call it

1338
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.529
objective from, from an objective perspective. Um These are

1339
01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.819
sort of propagandistic biases that people use um to

1340
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:14.359
say, look, you know, the other side is so

1341
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:18.129
bad, they're not doing a principled thing, we're principled.

1342
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.919
And here's the principles that we uphold and their

1343
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:23.620
argument is that both sides are doing that. And,

1344
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:26.020
um, and they, but they both sides sort of

1345
01:12:26.029 --> 01:12:29.560
seem to be operating as if they're principle based,

1346
01:12:29.569 --> 01:12:31.890
whereas the other side isn't and their argument is

1347
01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:34.270
in both cases, they're not really being principle based.

1348
01:12:34.279 --> 01:12:37.799
They're just sort of choosing allies to focus on

1349
01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:40.240
for some of the reasons we talked about earlier.

1350
01:12:40.399 --> 01:12:42.520
So that's all, I'll, I'll leave it at that

1351
01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:43.640
as a summary. Yeah.

1352
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:48.149
So that's the summary. And you've already pointed there

1353
01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.919
to perhaps one or two aspects of it that

1354
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:54.140
you disagree with. But before we get into your

1355
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:59.529
disagreement, if they're right, what would you think would

1356
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:03.509
be the implicate, the main implications for political science

1357
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.410
and psychology?

1358
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:06.109
Oh, yeah. And I just want to say at

1359
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.319
the outset, I actually don't, I don't think I

1360
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:11.169
disagree. I actually, I kind of uh uh uh

1361
01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.990
as a human being disagree with it. I don't

1362
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.930
like it because I have my own political beliefs

1363
01:13:15.939 --> 01:13:17.850
and I'd like to think of principle and it,

1364
01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:20.000
it sort of offends my sensibilities and for that

1365
01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:22.430
reason, I think they're probably right. Like, I think

1366
01:13:22.439 --> 01:13:24.810
uh to the extent that something makes me feel

1367
01:13:24.819 --> 01:13:27.569
uncomfortable, I would iii I would prefer to err

1368
01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.009
on the side of assuming it's probably right. And

1369
01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.569
when you look at history and, or, yeah. So,

1370
01:13:32.839 --> 01:13:34.229
so, yeah. No, I actually do think they're right.

1371
01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.939
I think that there's still things to unpack about

1372
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.390
it. But I mean, and this, this is to

1373
01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:42.470
specifically answer your question, what they're really contributing is

1374
01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:47.120
this argument that against the existing status quo or

1375
01:13:47.129 --> 01:13:50.350
dogma within political science and psychology. And again, this

1376
01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:53.910
is not my area of expertise. Um TO the

1377
01:13:53.919 --> 01:13:56.589
extent that I've looked into it. I, I agree

1378
01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.299
with their assessment that this seems to be the

1379
01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:00.149
approach, but I, I don't want to suggest that

1380
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.250
I know every um I don't know that literature

1381
01:14:03.259 --> 01:14:06.330
as well as I know many others. Um But

1382
01:14:06.339 --> 01:14:08.850
my understanding and what they're arguing is and, and

1383
01:14:08.859 --> 01:14:12.089
the answer to your question is, um what has

1384
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.609
currently existed is this idea that what matters is

1385
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:22.459
ideology and once an ideology is adopted, so people

1386
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:25.149
are sort of empty vessels, they take on an

1387
01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.870
ideology for different reasons. Um And then that ideology,

1388
01:14:29.879 --> 01:14:34.450
what follows from that ideology then determines their political

1389
01:14:34.459 --> 01:14:40.189
attitudes, their um um their political decisions, et cetera.

1390
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.879
And so, um and so this ideology from this

1391
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:50.850
ideology perspective, the enterprise is measuring differences in ideologies

1392
01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:54.149
and then determining who is sort of most attracted

1393
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.759
to what ideology, for example, if that's what you're

1394
01:14:56.770 --> 01:15:01.479
interested in. Um And, and then, um and then

1395
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:04.479
looking at uh well, what are the consequences of

1396
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:08.299
the ideologies for um for things like voting behavior

1397
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:11.129
or different kinds of decisions? And then if you

1398
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.509
want to change people's beliefs or opinions or voting

1399
01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.919
behavior or who they support. The idea is that

1400
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:20.080
you, you change their ideologies, right? Um And so

1401
01:15:20.089 --> 01:15:25.819
at every level, the existing theory was ideologies are

1402
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:29.209
sort of the central focal point of the wheel

1403
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.839
of political action. And that's really the efficient uh

1404
01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:36.720
place to measure political attitudes and opinions. It's the

1405
01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:40.129
place to um change them. And the pins off

1406
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:44.040
at all argument is that's basically backwards where the

1407
01:15:44.049 --> 01:15:49.430
ideology is sort of this um confabulation. Um And,

1408
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:51.640
and you can see that again in all these

1409
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:55.419
cases where if this is, in fact the ideology,

1410
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:57.520
what follows from it is not what people are

1411
01:15:57.529 --> 01:16:00.589
actually thinking or doing. Um And so that's the

1412
01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.640
main contribution and that's the thing that would need

1413
01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:05.819
to change is that it shifts the narrative of

1414
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:09.229
what the science of political psychology is from an

1415
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.709
ideology based approach where I think as they describe

1416
01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.850
it, the um the pins off at all, um

1417
01:16:15.859 --> 01:16:17.890
sort of they, I, I looked at a draft

1418
01:16:17.899 --> 01:16:20.330
of their response to the comments of their paper

1419
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.770
and um I forget where exactly if it's in

1420
01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.680
that or the target article, but they basically talk

1421
01:16:25.689 --> 01:16:28.040
about, you know, they characterized the, the, the, the

1422
01:16:28.049 --> 01:16:32.770
previous enterprises basically looking for the essential elements of

1423
01:16:32.779 --> 01:16:37.720
ideology, like just treating political science as the science

1424
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:42.015
of figuring out ideological essence of people. Um And

1425
01:16:42.024 --> 01:16:45.654
their argument is that's, that is, that's misleading, that's,

1426
01:16:45.665 --> 01:16:49.325
that's the exact opposite. And really, in fact, it's

1427
01:16:49.334 --> 01:16:54.285
understanding these much more prosaic but fundamental things about

1428
01:16:54.334 --> 01:17:00.640
people's alliances, people's interests, people's um uh decisions about,

1429
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.339
they look out in the world and they say,

1430
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.049
well, I think these people are on my side.

1431
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.890
I think these people aren't. Um, NOW there's a

1432
01:17:06.899 --> 01:17:09.129
separate issue of whether it's accurate, but in any

1433
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.720
case, that's their argument is it's alliances, its interests,

1434
01:17:13.779 --> 01:17:18.700
um it's cost benefit analysis and the ideology is

1435
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:23.430
secondary and is a coordinations device um that is

1436
01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:26.509
painted on top of this alliance structure and this

1437
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:30.410
jockeying for things like status access to resources, um

1438
01:17:30.419 --> 01:17:32.689
et cetera. So that's the change. It, it, it

1439
01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.870
essentially is a transformation of the, of the science

1440
01:17:35.879 --> 01:17:38.589
to the extent that their characterization holds, which I

1441
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.350
understand it to be fairly accurate.

1442
01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:43.620
Uh OK, but uh what do you think perhaps

1443
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:48.859
are some of the things uh bigger or smaller

1444
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:52.549
that they might be getting wrong in their argument?

1445
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.160
Well, I don't think it's wrong. I don't, I

1446
01:17:55.169 --> 01:17:57.100
don't think the argument is wrong but I think

1447
01:17:57.109 --> 01:17:59.910
it's incomplete and I think that's as complimentary as

1448
01:17:59.919 --> 01:18:02.569
one can get about anybody's uh work including one's

1449
01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.129
own. So I think they're right, but I think

1450
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.669
it's incomplete in the following sense. Um Number one

1451
01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.029
is, well, what counts as an alliance, right? So

1452
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.290
they're saying that an alliance sort of is what

1453
01:18:12.299 --> 01:18:15.850
underwrites um people's ideas. And so for me, I

1454
01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:18.850
my alliance might be people who are like poor.

1455
01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.350
Um POOR people, you know, in my country. And

1456
01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:24.919
so I don't want my, my country to sort

1457
01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:26.950
of, like, you know, bomb other poor people in

1458
01:18:26.959 --> 01:18:29.819
other countries or, like, you know, take money away

1459
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.270
from poor people in my country by building bombs.

1460
01:18:32.279 --> 01:18:36.140
Right. Um, BUT other people's allies might be, um,

1461
01:18:36.589 --> 01:18:39.580
the, uh, the people doing the bombing because they're

1462
01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:42.979
concerned about certain kind of economic systems prevailing over

1463
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:47.779
other kinds of economic systems. Um, um, YOU know,

1464
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.899
the, those kinds of alliances, the question is sort

1465
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:54.479
of, well, why do people look out in the

1466
01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:59.600
world and decide certain, uh, certain alliances are sort

1467
01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:04.660
of part of their interests or not? Um, AND,

1468
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:06.890
um, this is one of the issues with the,

1469
01:19:06.899 --> 01:19:10.419
with the idea of an alliance is that, um,

1470
01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.830
who people support is sort of their de facto

1471
01:19:13.839 --> 01:19:15.459
alliance. But then the question is, well, why do

1472
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:17.049
they support it? And you say, well, there are

1473
01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.240
benefits, there's benefits that, see the, see the costs.

1474
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:23.580
Well, is that actually true? Right. Like there's lots

1475
01:19:23.589 --> 01:19:27.330
of people who, um, as people point out, you

1476
01:19:27.339 --> 01:19:31.419
know, support economic policies that, um, so, you know,

1477
01:19:31.979 --> 01:19:36.799
poor people, um, receive propaganda about, um, you know,

1478
01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:38.700
you really should keep the rich people who are

1479
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:41.189
keeping you down, you know, in power because they're

1480
01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.740
protecting you from, like this out, uh, this threat

1481
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:46.049
from the outside. This is like, you know, demagogues

1482
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.149
throughout history have done this thing and we know

1483
01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.680
this, you know, and if in any one case,

1484
01:19:50.689 --> 01:19:51.830
you want to say it doesn't hold in this

1485
01:19:51.839 --> 01:19:54.220
particular case, if you look across history, this has

1486
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:56.759
happened many, many times. And so, well, what's the

1487
01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.620
alliance then? Right? Is it a, is it a

1488
01:19:58.629 --> 01:20:01.759
false representation? And maybe that's the answer, right? So

1489
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:04.770
maybe it's something like the poor people who are

1490
01:20:04.779 --> 01:20:09.089
being duped by the demagogue are falsely representing their

1491
01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.990
own interests, right? Um And so they're entering into

1492
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.580
an alliance with the demagogue because they think the

1493
01:20:14.589 --> 01:20:17.459
demagogue will protect them from like an external threat,

1494
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:20.310
that's not really real. And the demagogue is like

1495
01:20:20.319 --> 01:20:24.700
exploiting them for, you know, resource reasons. Um So

1496
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:28.189
saying that everything is sort of an alliance, which

1497
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.830
is not what self at all are saying, but

1498
01:20:29.839 --> 01:20:31.729
if you just take the idea sort of simply

1499
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.490
on its own, you know, um which is useful

1500
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.279
to do, you just see that the idea of

1501
01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:41.709
an alliance sort of needs to be complimented with

1502
01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.390
the idea that um alliances are perceptions. Um And

1503
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:50.759
they can be wrong. Um It's not an easy

1504
01:20:50.770 --> 01:20:53.540
question to ask in which way are they wrong

1505
01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:56.060
and who's wrong at which time? Um But that's

1506
01:20:56.069 --> 01:21:00.040
an example of how the theory is limited. Um

1507
01:21:00.049 --> 01:21:03.700
It's also difficult to predict how alliances might change.

1508
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:05.870
I mean, the alliance theory gives you an idea.

1509
01:21:05.879 --> 01:21:08.640
So for example, as we talked about before, you

1510
01:21:08.649 --> 01:21:10.750
know, if I'm a member of group A and

1511
01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:12.060
there are other people in my group who are

1512
01:21:12.069 --> 01:21:15.020
doing rating of group B and I'm not benefiting

1513
01:21:15.029 --> 01:21:18.729
from that, from an alliance perspective to the degree

1514
01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.899
that, that the theory or the systems in the

1515
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.830
of all brains are sort of representing. There are

1516
01:21:23.839 --> 01:21:25.740
some people in group A who really don't benefit

1517
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:27.379
from rating. And there are some people in group

1518
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:30.700
A who do, you might anticipate that in the

1519
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:34.950
future, that alliance structure between the people who benefit

1520
01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:36.589
and the people who don't within group A might

1521
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.629
start to break up, right? Um And so an

1522
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.930
alliance based account may give you traction on how

1523
01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:46.399
alliances change. But that's still another thing that is

1524
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:50.169
sort of um not fully unpacked in the pins

1525
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:52.779
off paper, but it's also, you know, that's a

1526
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:56.089
complicated dynamic, right? So one paper can only do

1527
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.370
so much. So I wouldn't say that it's wrong.

1528
01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:02.660
But something like uh the fact that alliances shift

1529
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:05.779
um in trying to have content in one's model

1530
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:08.709
or theory to predict how they shift is also

1531
01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.529
something that's not in their, their particular paper, but

1532
01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.729
that's not a limit of their paper. It's just

1533
01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:15.770
a description of sort of the scope of it.

1534
01:22:15.779 --> 01:22:18.250
But I would say that's another example of the

1535
01:22:18.259 --> 01:22:21.950
kind of thing that is still missing, not that

1536
01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:24.830
they're responsible single-handedly from doing it. But, but so

1537
01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.970
those are two examples, you know, just the dynamic

1538
01:22:26.979 --> 01:22:30.060
nature of alliances and then also this issue of

1539
01:22:30.069 --> 01:22:32.859
sort of alliances can be wrong um in a

1540
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:36.100
sense or at least, you know, misperceptions. Um uh

1541
01:22:36.129 --> 01:22:38.689
But I think those are, those are benefits of

1542
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:42.049
the theory in the sense of we, one quickly

1543
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.279
realizes that these are things that we have to

1544
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:47.189
like come to terms with. Um um AND I

1545
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.890
think both things have come and come to terms

1546
01:22:49.899 --> 01:22:53.490
with um um in uh in past work. But

1547
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.240
I think the alliance model is a nice way

1548
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:58.569
to think about it and it connects it more

1549
01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:02.319
up to these basic questions about this alliance psychology

1550
01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:06.589
that removes it from these very specific idiosyncratic things.

1551
01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:08.689
Um And it's also very nice in the sense

1552
01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.129
of um it removes it from sort of this

1553
01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:14.020
exotic ideology thing, you know, where you sort of

1554
01:23:14.029 --> 01:23:17.120
read things. Well, you know, like these people were,

1555
01:23:17.129 --> 01:23:20.439
um you know, are hostile or belligerent because, you

1556
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:22.990
know, they have like, um and there's some very

1557
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.680
esoteric, you know, philosophical ideology, you know, as opposed

1558
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:29.060
to, you know, uh well, they're like belligerent because,

1559
01:23:29.069 --> 01:23:32.339
you know, like the generation before people bombed them,

1560
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:34.459
you know, and like their Children don't have enough

1561
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:40.009
food. Um SOMETIMES as um um as, as sort

1562
01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.979
of the, the intelligent uh the, the, the sort

1563
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:46.169
of intelligentsia, right? The, the, the class of people

1564
01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.180
who work uh by thinking uh making their living,

1565
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:52.620
it's very easy among, among that uh collective of

1566
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:55.120
people to sort of think that like, you know,

1567
01:23:55.509 --> 01:23:58.970
esoteric ideas are what drive behavior and are what's

1568
01:23:58.979 --> 01:24:01.359
really important as opposed to very simple things. Like

1569
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.109
we started this conversation. Why does, why do groups

1570
01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.629
happen? Why does conflict happen? It's simple stuff. Like

1571
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.680
people don't like getting hurt, they don't want their

1572
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:11.100
family to get hurt, they need stuff to live.

1573
01:24:11.109 --> 01:24:13.395
Um And so that's another benefit of the pints

1574
01:24:13.484 --> 01:24:16.765
off argument. Um Is that I think it, it

1575
01:24:16.774 --> 01:24:19.794
brings the narrative back down to, to ground reality

1576
01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:22.625
about those kinds of things. Um Again, that's not

1577
01:24:22.634 --> 01:24:25.615
saying that people aren't being duped, but it actually

1578
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:28.354
again, clarifies if they're being duped. Um

1579
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:33.490
OK, so I have then one final question, perhaps

1580
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.759
more of a topic I would like to explore

1581
01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:41.009
today. So you have this very interesting preprint titled

1582
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.129
What The Difference The Mind Makes, where you point

1583
01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:48.770
to the fact that uh psychologists are also using

1584
01:24:48.779 --> 01:24:52.450
their Evolved psychology when studying the mind. And basically

1585
01:24:52.459 --> 01:24:57.649
you talk about the difference, detecting mechanisms and then

1586
01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:02.000
you argue for possibly the influence that they have

1587
01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:05.939
on the science of psychology. So co could you

1588
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:10.000
explain that the reprint? I mean, what are you

1589
01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:12.640
arguing there? Exactly. Yeah.

1590
01:25:12.729 --> 01:25:16.520
It's basically the evolutionary psychology of psychology, right? And,

1591
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:17.879
and we even talked about that a little bit

1592
01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:19.520
with the free will thing, right? Where it's sort

1593
01:25:19.529 --> 01:25:23.830
of saying look psychologists, philosophers, these are still people

1594
01:25:23.839 --> 01:25:25.990
doing stuff and if you want to study people

1595
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.600
doing stuff, you can use an evolutionary psychological approach.

1596
01:25:28.609 --> 01:25:31.919
So it's basically the evolutionary psychology of psychology. Um

1597
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:35.160
And so this is this is uh basically um

1598
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:39.189
a vehicle to sort of introduce that enterprise. Um

1599
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.450
The past modularity paper was about that the free

1600
01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:45.589
will paper will be about that. Um And then

1601
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.080
this paper that you're talking about is also about

1602
01:25:48.089 --> 01:25:51.430
that and they're all under that umbrella. Um This

1603
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.220
specific paper is about difference detecting mechanisms as you've

1604
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:55.919
mentioned. And I'll just introduce sort of what that

1605
01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:58.330
is. And so this is an idea coming from

1606
01:25:58.439 --> 01:26:01.500
David Bust in particular. Um um And then Aaron

1607
01:26:01.839 --> 01:26:04.680
Lukaszewski is also somebody who has sort of picked

1608
01:26:04.689 --> 01:26:07.790
up and, and advanced this idea. And the idea

1609
01:26:07.799 --> 01:26:11.600
is that the human mind um really should be

1610
01:26:11.609 --> 01:26:15.680
designed from an evolutionary perspective to detect important differences

1611
01:26:15.689 --> 01:26:18.500
in situations. Like is there a predator coming at

1612
01:26:18.509 --> 01:26:21.520
me or not? Right. Um Or, you know, am

1613
01:26:21.529 --> 01:26:24.439
I safe or not? And the idea is that

1614
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:29.720
for an evolved organism, what matters are cues that

1615
01:26:29.729 --> 01:26:36.000
allow the organism to detect important things, not necessarily

1616
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:41.080
having a really rich true representation of the causal

1617
01:26:41.089 --> 01:26:44.149
structure of the world. So for example, a gazelle

1618
01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:47.259
um you know, needs to know, am I going

1619
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:50.200
to be predicated upon by a lion? Uh SO

1620
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:52.529
it might have detectors for like, you know, a

1621
01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.120
lion, it might have detectors in its brain for

1622
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:56.990
sort of like does the lion see me is

1623
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.120
the lion close to me and those are all

1624
01:26:59.129 --> 01:27:02.390
important things for the gazelle to sort of have

1625
01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:05.020
about lion nature, right? It needs to be able

1626
01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:07.029
to detect, am I in a situation where the

1627
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.359
lion is gonna get me or not? Um ANYTHING

1628
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.919
else about how the lion works would not be

1629
01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:14.959
selected for it, right? Like the gazelle is not

1630
01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:18.580
gonna know like the cognitive neuroscience of lions and

1631
01:27:18.589 --> 01:27:21.109
how they work, right? Like that's not, that's not

1632
01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.229
worth it for the cost benefit calculation of the

1633
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.979
gazelle. So the idea is that the gazelle's brain

1634
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.209
is just like ours. We are not evolved to

1635
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.220
understand how our minds work or other minds work.

1636
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:36.290
We're equipped with the analog of the lion detector

1637
01:27:36.299 --> 01:27:38.689
in all kinds of domains. And so what that

1638
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:43.120
means is that our psychology as a default is

1639
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:47.250
using systems when we're doing science that are difference

1640
01:27:47.259 --> 01:27:51.009
detecting mechanisms, they're designed for detecting, am I in

1641
01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:54.890
a predation situation or not not systems that are

1642
01:27:54.899 --> 01:27:56.750
just sort of set up already to sort of

1643
01:27:56.759 --> 01:28:00.160
look at objectively the causal structure of the world.

1644
01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:04.290
Um And an example of another difference detecting uh

1645
01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:07.370
example outside of like gazelle thing would be something

1646
01:28:07.379 --> 01:28:08.620
like, you know, let's say you go to a

1647
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:10.529
city and you wanna pick out a good restaurant,

1648
01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:14.009
right? Um What would you look at? Well, it

1649
01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.850
would be the stuff that varies. So how would

1650
01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:17.850
you determine what's a good restaurant or what's a

1651
01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.890
bad restaurant? Well, it might be something like, what's

1652
01:28:19.899 --> 01:28:22.560
the level of upkeep of the decor? How hard

1653
01:28:22.569 --> 01:28:25.209
is it to get into a, make a reservation?

1654
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.959
Is there a line in front of the restaurant

1655
01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:30.089
or not? Those are the kinds of cues that,

1656
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.879
uh, allow you to distinguish between the quality of

1657
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:35.759
the different restaurants and those are the kinds of

1658
01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:39.250
things that a difference detecting mechanism would attend to.

1659
01:28:39.759 --> 01:28:42.120
But what wouldn't it attend to? It wouldn't attend

1660
01:28:42.129 --> 01:28:44.720
to things like cooking food, right? Um BECAUSE that's

1661
01:28:44.729 --> 01:28:48.259
how constant across all the different restaurants, um you

1662
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:50.100
know, it wouldn't attend to things like, you know,

1663
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:53.240
serving the food. So all of the fundamental causal

1664
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:56.799
elements of actually having a good restaurant, right, which

1665
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.779
is actually cooking food, preparing it for people getting

1666
01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:02.290
tables and chairs and lighting and buildings, those are

1667
01:29:02.299 --> 01:29:05.950
all held constant. So those disappear from the perspective

1668
01:29:05.959 --> 01:29:09.629
of the difference, detecting mechanisms. And so the idea

1669
01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.700
is that when we use our psychology to reason

1670
01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.390
about the mind, we can be misled into only

1671
01:29:16.399 --> 01:29:19.950
looking at the little bit of variation as opposed

1672
01:29:19.959 --> 01:29:23.270
to the large scale causal structure as the example

1673
01:29:23.279 --> 01:29:26.729
of the restaurant just showed. And so, um what

1674
01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.299
Aaron Kraszewski has done is argued and David Buss

1675
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:32.390
as well has argued that in personality psychology, what

1676
01:29:32.399 --> 01:29:38.259
personality psychologists have been doing um is focusing on

1677
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:41.419
differences at the expense of sort of underlying deep

1678
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:44.129
causal structure. So as the analogy with the restaurant

1679
01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:47.089
would be that they're f been focusing on sort

1680
01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.020
of the long lines and the upkeep of the

1681
01:29:49.029 --> 01:29:52.089
decor and not at the making food. Um YOU

1682
01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.220
know, making sure there's a table and a chair

1683
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:56.939
and you have waiters um serving food and things

1684
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:59.609
like that. What I argue in this paper is

1685
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:02.779
that our theory of mind system is one of

1686
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:06.160
these difference detecting mechanisms. And so it's sort of

1687
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:08.060
instead of just taking for granted this thing I

1688
01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.609
said before, which was that like, you know, Dave

1689
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:13.220
wants to raise his arm. Um YOU know, that's

1690
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:16.310
the structure of our intuitive theory of mind. So

1691
01:30:16.319 --> 01:30:19.240
there's sort of an agent slot, a stance slot

1692
01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:21.879
and then a content slot. So like Sally wishes

1693
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:24.370
it would rain. You know, Sally believes there's a

1694
01:30:24.379 --> 01:30:28.250
lion. Sally remembers a lion. Sally is, you know,

1695
01:30:28.259 --> 01:30:30.729
um picturing a lion like this is the structure

1696
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.120
of our intuitive everyday way of talking about um

1697
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:38.129
mental states. Um And this is called the propositional

1698
01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:40.490
calculus. I mean, you can be jargony about it.

1699
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:43.310
Um But it's sort of a, a real fundamental

1700
01:30:43.319 --> 01:30:48.430
um um bedrock of philosophical and psychological theories of

1701
01:30:48.439 --> 01:30:50.069
how the mind works. There's sort of an agent

1702
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.629
slot, a processor stance slot and a content slot.

1703
01:30:53.649 --> 01:30:54.830
And what I do in the paper is just

1704
01:30:54.839 --> 01:30:58.189
basically argue that's probably not a description and we

1705
01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.770
certainly know it's not a functional level description now

1706
01:31:00.779 --> 01:31:04.020
that we've talked about that it's an intentional level

1707
01:31:04.029 --> 01:31:06.390
description. And why is that the content of the

1708
01:31:06.399 --> 01:31:09.089
intentional level description? And the argument is it's an

1709
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:12.740
important difference detecting structure. So you can kind of

1710
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:15.779
think about the agent slot, the the stance or

1711
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:18.259
process slot and the content slot is drop down

1712
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:21.259
menus and computing. So, and to just give you

1713
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:24.660
a very, very simple intuition is sort of I

1714
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:28.879
see a bear versus I'm remembering a bear is

1715
01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:32.970
very different situation, right? So, so, so for the

1716
01:31:32.979 --> 01:31:34.890
purposes of you and I are like cold, we're

1717
01:31:34.899 --> 01:31:37.259
huddled together like behind a tree. We, you know,

1718
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:38.830
and we've been, we're out in the middle of

1719
01:31:38.839 --> 01:31:40.700
the woods and I tell you, you know, I

1720
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:42.850
see a bear versus I remember a bear, that's

1721
01:31:42.859 --> 01:31:44.770
a very different situation. If I remember a bear,

1722
01:31:44.779 --> 01:31:46.290
you don't have to get scared if I see

1723
01:31:46.299 --> 01:31:48.379
a bear, you do. And so the idea is

1724
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:53.129
that the process or stance slot is essentially doing

1725
01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:57.950
the work of distinguishing situations, a number of different

1726
01:31:57.959 --> 01:32:01.950
evolutionarily important situations, like does an agent perceive something

1727
01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:04.359
like that's an important, there's a set of inferences

1728
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:06.750
that follow from that? Are they currently perceiving it

1729
01:32:06.839 --> 01:32:09.609
or not? Are they remembering it? Right? Are they

1730
01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.220
thinking about it? The idea is that the reason

1731
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:14.709
why we have these categories of sort of seeing,

1732
01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:21.810
remembering, thinking, feeling that they don't necessarily carve up

1733
01:32:21.819 --> 01:32:24.189
the causal structure of how the mind works in

1734
01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:29.790
a very deep sense. But they um they distinguish

1735
01:32:29.799 --> 01:32:33.310
between really important kinds of situations for an evolved

1736
01:32:33.319 --> 01:32:36.870
organism, like seeing a bear versus remembering a bear,

1737
01:32:36.879 --> 01:32:40.180
right? So they're sort of, they're the kind of

1738
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:44.000
representations, the rough take representations that an evolved system

1739
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.660
should have about con specifics in one's own mental

1740
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:51.069
states. And then the content slot is the difference

1741
01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.939
between, you know, I want a bear versus I

1742
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:54.770
want a canoe, you need to know like what

1743
01:32:54.779 --> 01:32:56.680
that content is about. And the reason why there's

1744
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:59.200
an agent slot is it's the difference between, you

1745
01:32:59.209 --> 01:33:02.390
know, data Cesar bear versus Ricardo Caesar bear versus,

1746
01:33:02.399 --> 01:33:04.470
you know, somebody else sees a bear. Christian sees

1747
01:33:04.479 --> 01:33:07.160
a bear, those are important things. And so the

1748
01:33:07.169 --> 01:33:09.589
point of the paper, it's pretty basic, it's just

1749
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.830
saying look this propositional calculus, agent process content which

1750
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:18.299
forms the basis of propositional calculus, which has sort

1751
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:21.180
of been just taken as a given since, you

1752
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:25.399
know, philosophy of mind essentially started. Um YOU can

1753
01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:27.919
do the evolutionary psychology of that and sort of

1754
01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:31.740
understand why it has that structure that it has.

1755
01:33:31.759 --> 01:33:35.180
And so understanding it and analyzing it does two

1756
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:38.220
things. One is it allows us to think more

1757
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:41.439
about its features from a scientific perspective. But it

1758
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:44.060
also allows us to understand in a more deep

1759
01:33:44.069 --> 01:33:46.890
sense, the limits of it. Because again, it's just

1760
01:33:46.899 --> 01:33:50.080
like the gazelle, if a gazelle wants to do

1761
01:33:50.089 --> 01:33:54.830
science, it has to realize that the lying detectors

1762
01:33:54.839 --> 01:33:59.810
that it naturally has um like our intentional psychology

1763
01:33:59.819 --> 01:34:03.350
for reasoning about others in their minds is really

1764
01:34:03.359 --> 01:34:05.859
gonna mislead us about a lot of the causal

1765
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:09.410
structure. So if we think that Dave wants to

1766
01:34:09.419 --> 01:34:12.720
raise his hand is the causal structure is the

1767
01:34:12.729 --> 01:34:16.839
mechanisms um in the mind, then we're probably in

1768
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:19.270
trouble, you know. Um And so I, I talked

1769
01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:20.959
a little bit later on in the paper about

1770
01:34:21.029 --> 01:34:27.359
how this structure agent process content has colored theorizing

1771
01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:29.870
in psychology since the outset. And you can look

1772
01:34:29.879 --> 01:34:33.350
at very early work like um Franz Brannan in

1773
01:34:33.359 --> 01:34:36.839
the 18 hundreds. Um As far back as, as

1774
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:39.609
one can look on writing the idea that sort

1775
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:43.979
of content and process are separate and diss sociable

1776
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:49.129
is um is rampant throughout much of psychological psychology

1777
01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:51.720
history. Um So the idea that sort of, you

1778
01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:56.009
know, I'm thinking about Mr Smith, um And um

1779
01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.830
I'm thinking about, you know, Saint Peter's basilica. This

1780
01:34:58.839 --> 01:35:01.750
is an example by um Bertrand Russell in the

1781
01:35:01.759 --> 01:35:03.640
19 twenties. And even then by then, it was

1782
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:06.899
old um in his really good book analysis of

1783
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:08.919
mind. Um And he talks about how, you know,

1784
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:11.279
the process of thinking is the same, what's different

1785
01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:13.419
is the content. And you take that very old

1786
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:17.200
idea because of the propositional calculus. And even up

1787
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:20.000
through today, the idea that sort of certain kinds

1788
01:35:20.009 --> 01:35:24.350
of algorithms are content independent, certainly they can be

1789
01:35:24.359 --> 01:35:26.500
applied to different contents. But the idea that you

1790
01:35:26.509 --> 01:35:28.750
only need a certain kind of algorithm like bay

1791
01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:32.379
and updating or um you know, plug it in

1792
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:35.149
and um plug in the algorithm. The idea that

1793
01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.120
that's sufficient to solve a problem, any kind of

1794
01:35:39.129 --> 01:35:42.549
information processing problem is not true. And anybody who

1795
01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.660
looks in detail at solving any information processing problem,

1796
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:49.169
like reinforcement learning, early reinforcement learning. One of the

1797
01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.080
first instances of reinforcement learning was a Chucker playing

1798
01:35:53.089 --> 01:35:57.939
program. Um Richards. Um Well, yeah. Um uh Well,

1799
01:35:57.979 --> 01:36:01.319
I'll skip the 000 I won't go in that

1800
01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:03.020
aggression of the history of the checkers playing program.

1801
01:36:03.029 --> 01:36:05.950
But basically, the point is um you know, early

1802
01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:08.759
on people realized that reinforcement learning, for example, would

1803
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:11.970
not be sufficient on its own as a principle

1804
01:36:11.979 --> 01:36:16.634
to have a checkers playing program. You need checkers,

1805
01:36:16.645 --> 01:36:21.935
um specific kinds of um representations attached to that

1806
01:36:21.944 --> 01:36:25.245
more general algorithm, how you get those could be

1807
01:36:25.254 --> 01:36:27.555
plugged in or can be learned, but they still

1808
01:36:27.564 --> 01:36:30.225
have to be there. And um and that lesson

1809
01:36:30.234 --> 01:36:32.995
has kind of always been learned, but it's always

1810
01:36:33.004 --> 01:36:36.129
lost. Um People are always erring on the side

1811
01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:38.040
like the behaviorists of thinking you only need about

1812
01:36:38.049 --> 01:36:40.950
like seven rules and like everything else is trivial.

1813
01:36:41.049 --> 01:36:43.819
Um And the argument, for example, in the paper

1814
01:36:43.879 --> 01:36:45.069
and this may be right or it may be

1815
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.240
wrong, but it's an argument is that one of

1816
01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:49.930
the reasons why we keep forgetting this lesson is

1817
01:36:49.939 --> 01:36:53.209
the propositional calculus that our minds are structured to

1818
01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:57.549
think. There's the unitary thinker that uses principles of

1819
01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.750
information processing, like reasoning or thinking or plug in

1820
01:37:00.839 --> 01:37:04.640
something else like bay and updating that then applies

1821
01:37:04.649 --> 01:37:06.629
to all content. And so this is a deep

1822
01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.029
prejudice in the mind and to the extent our

1823
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.160
psychological theories recapitulate this deep prejudice. We're just sort

1824
01:37:14.169 --> 01:37:17.250
of rehashing what we know to be false until

1825
01:37:17.259 --> 01:37:19.189
we look into it again and find out that

1826
01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.479
it's not sufficient. So, so yeah, that's, that's what

1827
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:23.270
the papers about.

1828
01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:27.740
So my final, my final question today will be

1829
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:32.529
then if the main argument of your paper is

1830
01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:37.220
correct, how could we deal with it when it

1831
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:42.029
comes to how we do science and more specifically

1832
01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.339
uh psychological

1833
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:45.419
science? Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, and

1834
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:47.580
again, this is not even my idea, this is

1835
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:50.939
whenever we've looked, um it's to, as I talked

1836
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:52.939
about earlier, it's to move down a level and

1837
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:54.890
it is just sort of be skeptical about the

1838
01:37:54.899 --> 01:37:58.089
intentional level, say, look, it's fine as a description

1839
01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.379
of what we need to explain. But to then

1840
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:02.549
say, look, we have to move down this intuitive,

1841
01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.339
unintuitive level from the intuitive level to an unintuitive

1842
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:09.580
level, this functional level where the systems that we

1843
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:13.299
talk about are defined by their functions. And we

1844
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:16.089
have to speculate about what those functions might be.

1845
01:38:16.509 --> 01:38:19.540
So we're, we've been talking today about systems in

1846
01:38:19.549 --> 01:38:22.770
the mind that attend to alliances, that's not an

1847
01:38:22.779 --> 01:38:25.859
intuitive part of human psychology. That's not Dave believes

1848
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:30.879
this or Ricardo thinks that. Um And then, well,

1849
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:32.830
then how does that work? Right. And how does

1850
01:38:32.839 --> 01:38:35.620
the alliance system detector work? Well, it has to

1851
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:37.450
attend to certain cues and how did that, what

1852
01:38:37.459 --> 01:38:39.620
are those cues? And, right, you just keep unpacking

1853
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:44.459
that. And so the, the bottom line is we

1854
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:48.009
need a psychology, The the way around the the

1855
01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:53.500
problem is to embrace this functional level of analysis

1856
01:38:53.509 --> 01:38:57.979
for one. And for two, what that means if

1857
01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:00.620
you take it seriously is that we have to

1858
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:04.879
be able to speculate about abstract functions, we have

1859
01:39:04.890 --> 01:39:08.069
to be able to try to think about what

1860
01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:12.709
are the information processing the mind solves and what

1861
01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.229
are mechanical solutions to that and be prepared that

1862
01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.979
there will be many, many answers to that at

1863
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:25.740
many different levels of specificity. And I think one

1864
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:28.600
of the, one of the things I'm realizing that

1865
01:39:28.609 --> 01:39:30.979
I think is just it's very simple and fundamental

1866
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:34.589
to the success of psychology is if we go

1867
01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.990
in thinking that the science of the mind can

1868
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.589
be about as complicated as you know, seven systems,

1869
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.009
or we're gonna go in looking for two systems

1870
01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.000
or anything. If we're gonna go in with a

1871
01:39:46.009 --> 01:39:53.109
prior expectation of this has to be pretty simple.

1872
01:39:53.169 --> 01:39:55.660
Um It has to be a certain kind of

1873
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:58.709
thing as opposed to there's lots of stuff, doing

1874
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.700
lots of things, lots of places, which is already

1875
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:04.029
how we think about the body. Um, YOU know,

1876
01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.750
it's simple in that respect. It's just we should

1877
01:40:06.759 --> 01:40:08.549
go in the way we think about the body.

1878
01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.259
There's gonna be lots of stuff doing lots of

1879
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:15.470
things and simple things. Like, is it, is it

1880
01:40:15.479 --> 01:40:19.430
one system or two, is it um intuitive or

1881
01:40:19.439 --> 01:40:24.500
hard or easy or um those kinds of distinctions?

1882
01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:28.640
They're fine but they're not how you get there.

1883
01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:29.970
Um And so how you get there is you

1884
01:40:29.979 --> 01:40:34.299
stay at that functional level and you also then

1885
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:37.839
have to be able to speculate about functions before

1886
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:41.319
you um before you start collecting data. And this

1887
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:44.830
is the other problem in psychology is there's a

1888
01:40:44.839 --> 01:40:49.939
long standing tension between psychology being a science of

1889
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:52.370
how the mind works and science being a collection

1890
01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:56.069
of empirical facts. Um And if you're gonna do

1891
01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.000
an engineering enterprise, which is what essentially psychology is.

1892
01:41:00.339 --> 01:41:03.160
Um YOU have to have theories about what you

1893
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:06.259
should be looking for. And the theory crisis in

1894
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:09.370
psychology is doing a good job of exposing failures

1895
01:41:09.379 --> 01:41:11.319
in theory. But I think there's a much deeper

1896
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:14.979
issue that hasn't been addressed, which is everybody's happy

1897
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:17.350
to say there's a theory crisis. But if you

1898
01:41:17.359 --> 01:41:20.200
take seriously what's required to resolve it, we already

1899
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:22.240
know what that is because we, we don't have

1900
01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:24.200
a theory crisis in early steps of vision, we

1901
01:41:24.209 --> 01:41:26.259
don't have a theory crisis in early steps of

1902
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:30.479
motor control. And what, why that is is because

1903
01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:33.490
those are areas where we really have a clear

1904
01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:36.729
idea about what the information processing problems are and

1905
01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:39.569
people are taking seriously that there have to be

1906
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.910
a lot of mechanisms for dealing with each of

1907
01:41:41.919 --> 01:41:44.229
those problems. But if you look at many area,

1908
01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.029
other areas of psychology, if you try to write

1909
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.419
a paper about what are the problems inherent in

1910
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:52.220
groups? For example, like my, how does the mind

1911
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:54.000
see a group paper which is published at B

1912
01:41:54.009 --> 01:41:55.850
BS? I've tried to, I've tried to publish that

1913
01:41:55.859 --> 01:41:58.790
other places. Um And people said, well, you don't

1914
01:41:58.799 --> 01:42:01.520
have data or you don't have a model, right?

1915
01:42:01.529 --> 01:42:04.240
And the point is that what I was talking

1916
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:06.509
about is the stuff you need to do before

1917
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.500
you have data before you have a model because

1918
01:42:08.509 --> 01:42:10.120
you don't know what data to look for, what,

1919
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:13.180
what to model. And this was not a one

1920
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:15.770
off thing. I've this, I've come up against this

1921
01:42:15.779 --> 01:42:18.910
issue for many other projects at this stage. I've

1922
01:42:18.919 --> 01:42:22.259
talked to many other people and so there is

1923
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:25.120
uh a culture and it's nobody's fault. It's just

1924
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:29.029
a structural issue. There's a culture of not adequately

1925
01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:32.250
allowing for the enterprise that derives what we should

1926
01:42:32.259 --> 01:42:36.020
be looking for first before we start conducting our

1927
01:42:36.029 --> 01:42:39.220
modeling or empirical studies. You know, I'm an experimental

1928
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:42.160
psychologist too, but we have to be willing to

1929
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:45.359
sort of be both theorists, speculative theorists and then

1930
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:48.879
also check our ideas um in psychology is just

1931
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:52.580
not structured right now um to do both things.

1932
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:54.600
So sort of half of psychology is missing the,

1933
01:42:54.609 --> 01:42:56.859
the front half. And that's, that's the the real

1934
01:42:56.870 --> 01:43:00.120
problem. And, and so functional level of analysis in

1935
01:43:00.129 --> 01:43:04.209
allowing for speculative ideas about problems and their solutions.

1936
01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.600
Um Those are the things we have to do

1937
01:43:05.609 --> 01:43:06.640
to solve this problem.

1938
01:43:08.089 --> 01:43:11.549
Great. So uh as I said, at the beginning,

1939
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.020
I will be leaving a link also to our

1940
01:43:14.029 --> 01:43:16.850
first conversation in the description box of this one

1941
01:43:16.859 --> 01:43:20.729
which I think all everyone should watch or listen

1942
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.290
to because it provides a lot of background and

1943
01:43:23.299 --> 01:43:27.205
context to our conversation today. So, but apart from

1944
01:43:27.214 --> 01:43:29.495
that, would you like to tell people again where

1945
01:43:29.504 --> 01:43:31.895
they can find you and your work on the

1946
01:43:31.904 --> 01:43:32.475
internet?

1947
01:43:32.975 --> 01:43:35.995
Sure, absolutely. So, um so currently we are having

1948
01:43:36.004 --> 01:43:38.725
this conversation where I am in Berlin, Germany. But

1949
01:43:38.734 --> 01:43:40.714
um by the time I think it's posted, I

1950
01:43:40.725 --> 01:43:43.674
will be in um sunny Santa Barbara. So um

1951
01:43:43.685 --> 01:43:45.705
if you look at me um at the University

1952
01:43:45.714 --> 01:43:48.700
of California, Santa Barbara, um I'm in the Psychology

1953
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:51.479
of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Um I'm also a

1954
01:43:51.490 --> 01:43:54.870
member of the Center for Evolutionary Psychology. Um And

1955
01:43:54.879 --> 01:43:57.310
so if you look me up that way, um

1956
01:43:57.319 --> 01:43:59.919
or just Google scholar that, that'll be a way

1957
01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:02.640
in my last name is sort of imposing Pietra

1958
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:05.270
Zi. Uh It's, it's a difficult name to spell.

1959
01:44:05.279 --> 01:44:08.790
But if you just start Pieetr A but, but

1960
01:44:08.799 --> 01:44:10.189
hopefully by the time you get to A or

1961
01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.750
S uh something will fill in um and you

1962
01:44:12.759 --> 01:44:14.339
can go from there. But uh but that's how

1963
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:15.069
to find me. Yeah.

1964
01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.779
Ok, great. So look, thank you so much again

1965
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:21.100
for coming on the show. It's always a big

1966
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:23.979
pleasure to talk with you. And as I said,

1967
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:27.250
when we were talking about free will. If you're

1968
01:44:27.259 --> 01:44:30.140
open to that, please come back on the show

1969
01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.600
next year or so with doctor Christian Li to

1970
01:44:33.609 --> 01:44:34.770
talk more about

1971
01:44:34.779 --> 01:44:36.759
that. That'd be great. I don't think we will

1972
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:38.500
have a choice about it. So,

1973
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.370
hi guys. Thank you for watching this interview. Until
