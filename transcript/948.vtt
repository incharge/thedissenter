00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.779
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:05.730
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.579
today I'm joined by Doctor Honorata Maus. She is

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.890
associate professor in the Political Science Department at the

5
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.270
University of Amsterdam. And today we're talking about topics

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.620
like democracy, the election win or lose or gap,

7
00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:25.520
citizen support for democratic checks and balances, civil society,

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.670
political legitimacy and some other related topics. So Dr

9
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.348
Mazu, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.880
everyone.

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.419
Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.439
So let's start here with uh democracy. So from

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.380
the perspective of political science, what is democracy exactly?

14
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:51.509
And how do you go about classifying particular political

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.060
systems as democratic or nondemocratic?

16
00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.000
We start with a really, really big question that

17
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.830
could take probably an entire interview in itself. Um

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.480
So let's let's open this Pandora box. Um So

19
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.620
of course, there is uh an incredibly huge amount

20
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:17.110
of scholarship trying to classify categorize political regimes and

21
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.669
to find out what makes a democracy. Uh And

22
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.569
I think the most basic distinction that we can

23
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.629
make in these definitions of democracies of democracy is

24
00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.230
whether we stick to some kind of minimalist. Uh

25
00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.699
DEFINITION, which would be it's the rule by the

26
00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.309
people. And then usually we end up with uh

27
00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.669
some sort of um a criterion about electoral procedures,

28
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.870
right? So you have to have elections. So that

29
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:48.290
regime is called democracy. Uh And then there are

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.529
the more extended uh broader definitions of democracy that

31
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.040
also add additional criteria which would be criteria such

32
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.089
as checks and balances. So for example, the freedom

33
00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.190
of the media, the role of the citizens in

34
00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:06.230
opposition pluralism. So all these extra elements uh would

35
00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.460
then lead to an extended version of uh extended

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.809
definition of democracy. And by many scholars that would

37
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.740
already be called a liberal democracy. So adding this

38
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.080
extra criteria would mean that we are ending up

39
00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.839
with liberal democracy. Now, the question is, can you

40
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.119
have just purely uh electoral democracy without any of

41
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.619
this additional criteria? And I think this is where

42
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.520
we are now also looking at the political world

43
00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.809
struggling a little bit because the question is, is

44
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.029
it just the rule of majority that we are

45
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.380
ending up with when we just stick to this

46
00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.679
uh rule of? Oh yeah, the winners of the

47
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.520
elections have the right to rule and then the

48
00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.960
majority is entitled to basically uh propose and execute

49
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.369
policies, right? Um So without any additional constraints, can

50
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.940
this be called a democracy but purely Demos, Kratos,

51
00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.679
it would be the rule by the people.

52
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.759
Mhm Yeah, this is very interesting because I I

53
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.330
mean, I guess that we could say and I,

54
00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.910
you mentioned that briefly there that there's not just

55
00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.669
one single kind of democracy or possible democratic regime.

56
00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:23.309
Uh AND there's also different levels of democracy, right?

57
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.975
Because there are many different facts, facts that political

58
00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:32.335
scientists and other uh scholars and even politicians, international

59
00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:38.735
organizations look into to classify, for example, uh how

60
00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:44.186
much democracy there really is in particular countries. And

61
00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:47.136
I guess that another important thing that you mentioned

62
00:03:47.145 --> 00:03:50.611
there is that we usually tend to associate democracy

63
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.102
with the rule of the majority. But I guess

64
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:56.292
that nowadays, at least we also care a lot

65
00:03:56.302 --> 00:04:02.212
about uh the rights of minorities of minor groups,

66
00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:06.811
also the their rights and interests also being respected,

67
00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:09.582
right? And that also counts as I guess uh

68
00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:11.531
democratic or not

69
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.149
or liberal. So that's exactly the discussion that we

70
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.670
are having, right? So where, where are these boundaries?

71
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.059
And can we have one without the other? And

72
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.649
of course, uh you know, just total limitation of

73
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.859
democracy to elections is um we can bring it

74
00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.640
to the absurdity even because you can think about

75
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.140
having elections in um let's say old authoritarian communist

76
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.239
systems where they were meaningless because you just had

77
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.475
one party and that party could not lose. So

78
00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:43.015
just having elections obviously is not enough to establish

79
00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:45.524
a democratic rule, right? You would not call the

80
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.904
Soviet Union and a democratic regime just because they

81
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:53.125
organized elections. So here we come with the criteria

82
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:56.135
that are also coming from the, the classic uh

83
00:04:56.144 --> 00:05:00.304
literature like dao's uh criteria of pluralism and contestation.

84
00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:03.239
So you have to have at least some actors

85
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.880
that are competing in elections, some political parties that

86
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.540
are fighting for power. And it has to be

87
00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:12.049
possible to uh to contest one another, right? So

88
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.839
it cannot be that just uh the Communist Party

89
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.500
always wins and nobody can criticize it. Um So

90
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.529
already within this electoral uh definition, there are extra

91
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.429
criteria that are being added to make it a

92
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.559
democracy. And then there is of course, this classical

93
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.820
dilemma of uh of the tyranny of the majority,

94
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.600
right? So uh what you mentioned uh who is

95
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:37.809
the majority or who is actually the people who

96
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.179
are supposed to rule? And is it all the

97
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.260
citizens of the country or is it just the

98
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:48.290
majority that at a particular moment prevails in elections?

99
00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:50.179
Right? And what do we do then about the

100
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.839
rights of the minorities? And this usually comes under

101
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.269
the definition of liberal democracy. So how do we

102
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.420
treat those who don't necessarily win the elections? And

103
00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:02.790
it becomes increasingly complicated in more diverse societies of

104
00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:06.470
nowadays, right? When you have multiple groups coming together.

105
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.480
So if you think about how we used to

106
00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:13.000
live as humans in our small scale communities, the

107
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.579
diversity was very limited, right? So uh basically the

108
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.709
will of the majority would represent almost everybody. Uh

109
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.420
And it was also much easier to check uh

110
00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:26.750
whether the uh the, the powerful actually violate the

111
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.429
rights of the minority would be maybe, I don't

112
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.619
know, 10 people out of 50 right. Uh And

113
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.859
nowadays, this becomes very complicated and intricate in the

114
00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:40.290
diverse societies. But also you can see that um

115
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.989
because of that we have this gradation of uh

116
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.200
you know, democratic of different political systems and that

117
00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:51.600
some systems perform maybe better in terms of including

118
00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:56.140
those minorities in the governing and some perform a

119
00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.839
bit worse. So to give you an example, I

120
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.339
live now in the Netherlands, uh I come from

121
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.500
Poland, so I can at least compare from my

122
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.739
own experience. But also as political science, how these

123
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.130
systems perform in the Netherlands, you never have a

124
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.750
majority government. The pluralism is so high in terms

125
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.730
of the political, political game and political actors that

126
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.690
are competing, that it is impossible to rule just

127
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.459
with one party. Uh And this is not the

128
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.040
case in, for example, Poland with you can have

129
00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:30.779
uh a majority government, right? Which means that in

130
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.790
the Netherlands, you always automatically include uh actors that

131
00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:39.679
are actually minority actors in the governing process. So

132
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.950
even small parties that don't get a lot of

133
00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:44.160
votes have always a chance to end up in

134
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.279
a governing coalition just because the system allows it,

135
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.799
right? And there is, first of all, there is

136
00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:51.869
no threshold for getting into the parliament and second

137
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.390
of all, you have so many parties that actually

138
00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:57.679
collect votes that you cannot rule with just one

139
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.440
party. So you always have to build a consensus.

140
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.600
This can have also disadvantages, of course, in terms

141
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:07.309
of policy making. But when you think about uh

142
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:12.390
potential extreme policies that can come with the majority

143
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:16.140
rule, they are kind of eliminated. And these are

144
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:21.959
usually the dangers of having one political party, majoritarian

145
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.970
party come to power uh because they can exclude

146
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.160
them, the minorities from, you know, the decisions and

147
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.179
even harm them, right? So because of that, well,

148
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.580
different political systems will perform differently, although they might

149
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.500
be in principle still called All Democratic.

150
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.109
Mhm. And by the way, I think this is

151
00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:46.270
a very important point to drive home because many

152
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.219
times when people think about democracies, we focus mostly,

153
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.489
I guess on uh everyone, everyone being able to

154
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.270
vote there is if there's universal suffrage there, right?

155
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.570
But uh I mean, democracy is much more than

156
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.122
just being given to vote in elections. It's also

157
00:09:08.312 --> 00:09:12.643
uh many other kinds of political participation that you

158
00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:15.893
are allowed to have, right? Like for example, uh

159
00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:20.773
having the right to protest uh participate in manifestations

160
00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:25.653
if you disagree with certain political decisions or if

161
00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:29.616
you want to uh the demand and certain political

162
00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:32.635
rights, for example, having a right to uh hunger

163
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.385
strike or something like that, having the right when

164
00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:39.875
it comes to labor rights to create labor unions.

165
00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:43.156
And so there, there's a bunch of ways of

166
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:48.666
participating in politics that uh must be granted for

167
00:09:48.676 --> 00:09:50.955
them to be democratic.

168
00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:54.255
Right. Yes. And I think this is also something

169
00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:57.919
that distinguishes. Uh MAYBE this is, I don't know

170
00:09:57.929 --> 00:09:59.909
if it's still an appropriate term but more mature

171
00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.840
democracies from, let's say democracies in making that you

172
00:10:03.849 --> 00:10:08.440
have many more uh permitted but also stimulated uh

173
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.270
ways to actually participate in this democratic uh socio

174
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.630
economic or social political sphere, right? So there is

175
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.479
very little that is forbidden apart from, you know,

176
00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.200
like the the usual regulations, regulatory state that we

177
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.710
have. Uh And there is a lot of scope

178
00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:29.780
for expressing either your interests or your preferences or

179
00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:34.229
disappointment. Uh AS you say, associational life is a

180
00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:37.830
part of it, right? Uh But also uh the

181
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.270
institutions that are not state institutions such as the

182
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.770
media play a very important role there, right? And

183
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.140
if you compare the democratic regimes with uh non

184
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.250
democratic regimes, you see that the media space is

185
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.789
much more pluralistic in uh mature democracies than in

186
00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:58.200
uh you know, constrained environments of either new democracies

187
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.630
or uh or authoritarian regimes. At the moment when

188
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.669
uh an authoritarian regime falls, suddenly you get this

189
00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:08.909
chaos of info of information, right? That was suppressed

190
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:12.570
for a long time because only particular information was

191
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.849
allowed to uh uh you know, uh uh the

192
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.520
fill in, let's say the informational space. And once

193
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.869
that constraint is over, then you see new information

194
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.200
that was probably there but suppressed coming out. And

195
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.330
then you, you have this moment of uh yeah,

196
00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:35.780
uh kind of new, new ways of thinking being

197
00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:38.940
allowed and being voiced also in the public space.

198
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.979
Um And this also then structures in the end,

199
00:11:42.989 --> 00:11:47.640
the media environment in this uh democratizing situation, sometimes

200
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.200
it leads to the step towards either you know,

201
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.119
developed or consolidated democracies as it's called in the

202
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.539
literature. Sometimes it is again suppressed by the actors

203
00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:01.419
that uh start to overtake and dominate that information

204
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:05.510
space. And then that comes like with, for example,

205
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.559
in the case of Russia, which I studied for,

206
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.690
for a while, it comes with all kinds of

207
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.090
restrictions on the information space, but also the activities.

208
00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.950
So what you were talking about, right, who is

209
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.340
allowed to create an association, which interests are going

210
00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:21.229
to be present in the public space, um who

211
00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.890
is gonna be called a foreign agent, for example,

212
00:12:24.174 --> 00:12:29.085
rather than domestic uh NGO non governmental organization, right?

213
00:12:29.445 --> 00:12:32.804
So uh this is what distinguishes really this democratic

214
00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:36.885
space, public space or socio, political, socio economic space

215
00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:39.195
from uh authoritarian space.

216
00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:42.289
Mhm A and by the way, another as another

217
00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:45.210
very important aspect here that I think you've alluded

218
00:12:45.219 --> 00:12:49.200
to there briefly is has to do with just

219
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.809
generally speaking, freedom of expression, right? Freedom of the

220
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.770
press, the freedom of expression for individual citizens and

221
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.195
also the ability to uh manifest political opinions, criticize

222
00:13:03.205 --> 00:13:10.344
the government without suffering any political economic uh labor

223
00:13:10.354 --> 00:13:14.575
consequences. I mean, without getting fired, for example, without

224
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:18.885
being put into jail or uh legally persecuted in

225
00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:19.705
some way.

226
00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:23.299
Right. Exactly. Yes, it's about the freedom of expression,

227
00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:25.929
freedom to or the right to protest the right

228
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.080
to associate and these associations do not necessarily have

229
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.869
to exactly align with, let's say the political color

230
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.090
of the government, right? Uh So this is all

231
00:13:35.099 --> 00:13:39.260
that. Uh YEAH, it also seems, let's say the

232
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.880
most intuitive aspect of democracy. So voting is one

233
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.080
thing but the other thing is this freedom to

234
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.359
criticize and contest those who are in government by

235
00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:52.330
expressing, you know, your opposition, but also expressing your

236
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.640
interest that might be overlooked by that government, right?

237
00:13:56.099 --> 00:13:58.349
Or just even your existence if we are talking

238
00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:02.739
about some minority groups uh and their um their

239
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.549
livelihoods.

240
00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:07.969
Mhm. But when it comes to the so-called rule

241
00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:11.479
of the majority, I mean, as we mentioned before,

242
00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:14.729
but I'm going to stress it uh again now,

243
00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:18.469
uh it might be in particular context, at least

244
00:14:18.479 --> 00:14:23.520
a little bit problematic because of course, in democracy,

245
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.880
in human society, more generally, we have people with

246
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.330
different kinds of, of interests and of course, they

247
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.219
want to push for their own interests as individuals

248
00:14:34.229 --> 00:14:39.119
or groups politically. That's just how things work. But

249
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:44.520
sometimes uh majority uh if uh a particular ma

250
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:51.429
majority is interested in oppressing uh minority groups that

251
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.890
can also happen. And also I if a, if

252
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.630
a particular majority of people are interested in that

253
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.809
specifically, they might be able to politically overturn democracy

254
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.960
if they prefer, for example, an autocratic system and

255
00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:13.070
vote uh f for a political party that serves

256
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.820
those particular kinds of interests.

257
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.409
Yes, definitely. And this is now considered a problem,

258
00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:23.500
not only of the new democracies or those countries

259
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.130
that for some reason, they are still called new

260
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.020
democracies, but they democratized, democratized already in the 19

261
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.609
nineties, right? So at some point, maybe they are

262
00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:32.609
not so new anymore, but it is all encompassed

263
00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:37.299
under the term of uh democratic backsliding. So basically,

264
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:43.659
countries that have reached uh mature uh consolidated democracy

265
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:48.659
and that after um a party that has maybe

266
00:15:48.669 --> 00:15:51.489
not so democratic tendencies comes to power and has

267
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.479
the majority in the government. And in the parliament

268
00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:59.570
takes steps towards actually decreasing all these checks and

269
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.960
balances that we have uh in the political system

270
00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:06.900
to control their power, right? As citizens. Uh And

271
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.760
this is exactly the the problem that we are

272
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.349
struggling with now. And we also see that uh

273
00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:15.460
more and more we have uh uh a scientific

274
00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:18.020
consensus that it is not just a problem of

275
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.349
new democracies that this can happen anywhere, right? That

276
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.700
uh even in the oldest democracies that we have,

277
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.049
which are still not that old, by the way,

278
00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:30.419
our Democratic history is not so long. Uh But

279
00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:33.460
even in these oldest democracies like the US, it

280
00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:38.409
can happen that you have uh within a party

281
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:43.710
or uh within particular sections of a party trends

282
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.500
towards decreasing democracy. And if that party wins, then

283
00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.150
it seems like we are in trouble, right? So,

284
00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.150
of course, I'm alluding now also to the, to

285
00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:55.330
the win of Donald Trump and then particular powers

286
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.440
within the Republican Party that uh you know, they

287
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.409
cared a little bit less about the uh uh

288
00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:05.479
the independence of courts. Uh Another aspect that is

289
00:17:05.489 --> 00:17:07.800
happening and this is not just limited to Trump's

290
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.500
government, but in the US, for example, it's a

291
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.640
very common thing to interfere with uh the electoral

292
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.380
boundaries of uh which is called gerrymandering, right of

293
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.150
the precincts within which voting is happening so that

294
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.660
we can skew the elections in a particular way.

295
00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:26.569
So this kind of trends can happen and it

296
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:31.810
can happen exactly when the majority is given to

297
00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:35.410
uh to particular political options that maybe do not

298
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.500
care about democracy so much. And that was also

299
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.349
the case in the uh uh in Poland, when

300
00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:45.109
the law and justice came to power, they started

301
00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:48.119
interfering in different ways with the checks and balances.

302
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.969
So the judicial system, but also then uh the

303
00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:56.469
media space suddenly uh was uh being limited. So

304
00:17:56.479 --> 00:18:00.349
the public broadcaster has been pretty much taken over

305
00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:04.920
by the government and became something like a propaganda

306
00:18:04.979 --> 00:18:10.050
propaganda to for the governing party which you know,

307
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.400
in democracies, this is not what public TV should

308
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:19.040
be at least normative, right. Um And also the

309
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.280
limitations of rights of women were uh in the

310
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.530
end imposed by that party. So, you know, step

311
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.359
by step, starting with the judicial reform, but also

312
00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:31.920
the moving to the information space and then in

313
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.619
the end to this uh citizens rights, I wouldn't

314
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.859
call it minority rights because women are a majority.

315
00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:42.589
But uh let's say more vulnerable uh people's rights

316
00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:48.359
uh limitations uh as basically uh uh a move

317
00:18:48.369 --> 00:18:52.579
towards uh grab of power. So executive power of

318
00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:55.859
the party that is in charge. So that's exactly

319
00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:59.579
what you are saying, right, that majority uh rule

320
00:18:59.589 --> 00:19:04.270
does not necessarily always mean that we increase democratic

321
00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:06.660
uh of our political systems.

322
00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:10.680
By the way, there's uh something very interesting that

323
00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:14.890
you mentioned there that is basically that democracy, at

324
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.349
least as we understand it today is a very

325
00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:25.400
recent political phenomenon uh historically because uh sometimes uh

326
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.800
we talk about, for example, democracy in Ancient Greece

327
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.989
in Athens specifically. But if we go into the

328
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.630
details, uh I mean, it's very different from the

329
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.579
kinds of particularly liberal democracies that we are used

330
00:19:42.589 --> 00:19:46.189
to today because even back then, and this is

331
00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:49.550
just one aspect of it, there were others but

332
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:55.060
apart from uh them having slavery, uh it also

333
00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:01.890
the people were considered citizens and could participate politically

334
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.829
and, and it was basically almost just an elite

335
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:09.310
of people right? And so ju just those two

336
00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:12.709
aspects and there were others, of course, makes it

337
00:20:12.719 --> 00:20:17.540
very different from the kind of democracy that we

338
00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:20.430
tend to think about today. Right?

339
00:20:20.859 --> 00:20:23.520
Yeah. So it's yes and no in terms of

340
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.359
uh uh being a recent phenomenon. So in, in

341
00:20:26.369 --> 00:20:30.380
terms of the institutional shape of democracy that we

342
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.040
have, yes, it's a new, new thing, right? So

343
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.199
if we think about this large scale remote actually

344
00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:41.089
institutions that are operating, uh This is something newer

345
00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:44.410
constitutions are something that is new, for example. So

346
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.410
they start in Europe in the US, in the

347
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.949
18th century, right? The ideas of course, are not

348
00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:53.099
so new as you say already, the uh you

349
00:20:53.109 --> 00:20:56.030
know, the idea about how to take decisions uh

350
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.530
about uh some kind of consensus building. This is

351
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.339
all this has been there and you mentioned the

352
00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:05.369
ancient Greece and you know, the city state systems.

353
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.530
But if you think about it, actually our uh

354
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:15.989
communities from our evolutionary perspective, they were more democratic

355
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.930
than not, right? Not in the institutional sense, but

356
00:21:18.939 --> 00:21:21.630
in terms of how they were deciding about uh

357
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.219
their, their uh well, ho how they were making

358
00:21:26.229 --> 00:21:29.219
decisions about the most important issues uh that they

359
00:21:29.229 --> 00:21:30.459
were facing back then.

360
00:21:30.469 --> 00:21:34.150
Uh BASICALLY all they would run their societies even

361
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.089
if they were smaller scale.

362
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.800
Yes. So in uh this is still a very

363
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.890
preliminary research, but I also base it on the

364
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.939
research of others that has been done uh with

365
00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:49.239
the anthropological records. Uh What we can see is

366
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:54.579
that the anti domination uh intuition in the small

367
00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:58.020
scale communities was very strong, right? So, of course,

368
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.849
it varied a little bit because you had communities

369
00:22:00.859 --> 00:22:05.219
that face different challenges. Um But if you think

370
00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:08.300
about the most common trends, they were very vigilant

371
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.420
of being dominated by the leaders and the decisions

372
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.989
were taken communally. Of course, it was much easier

373
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.530
because you had smaller communities. So basically, everybody knew

374
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.839
each other, everybody knew what the intentions of the

375
00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:25.060
other persons are and they could easily control.

376
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.800
Uh Let me just ask you just to clarify,

377
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:32.550
uh you're referring there to traditional societies, like for

378
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.540
example, hunter gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists.

379
00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:41.920
So I looked in this particular study, we look

380
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.400
only at hunter gatherer societies and these are, these

381
00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.410
are anthropological records. So they're based on ethnography. So

382
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.810
these are not, you know, our societies as uh

383
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:55.390
thousands and thousands of years ago uh throughout our

384
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.689
evolution, but they are the best proxies, I guess

385
00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:00.119
we have uh in terms of how this small

386
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.310
scale face to face communities operated. So this is,

387
00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:05.930
this is what I'm talking about. Um And in

388
00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:10.229
this project, we look at how the communities contested

389
00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:13.449
their leaders and their decisions uh and when they

390
00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:15.410
wanted to grant more power to them, right? So

391
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.069
exactly this idea of when we delegate power and

392
00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:20.670
when we want to constrain it to find out

393
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.410
what kind of basic intuitions we have and maybe

394
00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.719
then think about, OK, which of these checks and

395
00:23:25.729 --> 00:23:28.369
balances that we have in terms of large institutions

396
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.599
nowadays um are more intuitive and which ones maybe

397
00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:35.410
people care the most about. Uh BECAUSE in the

398
00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.829
end, there is not so much backlash against democratic

399
00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:41.229
backsliding as you would expect if you would think,

400
00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:44.930
OK, we have this strong anti domination uh intuition.

401
00:23:45.329 --> 00:23:49.290
But then, you know, when this particular authoritarian party

402
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.479
comes to power, why don't we act as citizens?

403
00:23:51.489 --> 00:23:53.839
Why don't we have this drive to actually do

404
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:56.780
something about it and prevent them from uh constraining

405
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.530
our freedom?

406
00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:00.489
Mhm No, I it it's very good that you

407
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.119
clarified that because uh what I mentioned, I was

408
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:09.270
not thinking or considering at all smaller scale societies.

409
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.709
I mean, I've already had tons of anthropologists on

410
00:24:11.719 --> 00:24:14.260
the show, but in this particular case, I was

411
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.020
not thinking about them specifically. Uh BUT I was

412
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.349
perhaps thinking more about larger scale societies with perhaps

413
00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:27.540
hundreds of thousands, millions of people participating in them.

414
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.060
Uh And I was also perhaps considering the fact

415
00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:35.829
that uh democracy risk or at least recent democracies.

416
00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:39.579
I mean, uh it was a process to get

417
00:24:39.589 --> 00:24:42.910
there. It was not just for example, that uh

418
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.650
the US got their independence or there was for

419
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.800
example, the French revolution and the Institute of the

420
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.770
Republic there and then suddenly overnight anyone can, could

421
00:24:55.869 --> 00:25:00.719
vote anyone could participate politically. It was a process,

422
00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:03.569
I mean, not only for the vast majority of

423
00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:07.010
citizens, including in the early stages, the vast majority

424
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:13.630
of men, but also women and particular minority races

425
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.130
and other people like that.

426
00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:18.579
Of course, it was a struggle for suffrage rights,

427
00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:22.510
right? And maybe we could uh use the 18th

428
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.219
century mark or 18th 19th century mark as this

429
00:25:25.229 --> 00:25:28.939
moment when uh suffrage rights expansion was something that

430
00:25:28.949 --> 00:25:31.839
was happening. Although, you know, even some European countries

431
00:25:31.849 --> 00:25:34.280
uh such as Switzerland were very, very late in

432
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.369
the 20th century to introduce suffrage rights for women.

433
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.910
Uh But the 18th century when, when that starts,

434
00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:46.270
and that's also the process that um included a

435
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.959
lot of deliberation among the elites uh about what

436
00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:52.189
happens. And this comes from my research with a

437
00:25:52.199 --> 00:25:56.180
historian actually. So what happens when we give the

438
00:25:56.189 --> 00:26:00.589
suffrage rights to this uneducated masses, right? So that's

439
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:03.770
where the discussion about the populism uh and the

440
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.599
populist mob or the manipulation of the masses already

441
00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.459
starts. So this is the 18th century when we

442
00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:14.869
are developing uh our uh democratic checks and balances.

443
00:26:15.209 --> 00:26:19.130
So some say that this three politic and democratic

444
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.410
checks and balances are introduced exactly to control the

445
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.849
power of the mob or the potential of manipulation

446
00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:29.619
of the masses by the populists. So by some,

447
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.390
this is also seen as a very elitist move

448
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.930
right to actually constrain the influence of uh of

449
00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:39.140
the people on the other hand, of course, you

450
00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.989
also have to consider. Um YEAH, how do we

451
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.369
want our decisions to be made? Right. So you

452
00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.239
can decide majority is always right. But you can

453
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.930
also decide, well, there are situations where merit. So

454
00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:56.130
actually knowing things about the issue at stake is

455
00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.989
very important. And the further we get with our

456
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.410
technological development, the more um no complex the issues

457
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.369
that the states are dealing with we have and

458
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.189
therefore perhaps the role of uh merit and knowledge

459
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:15.750
and maybe even technocracy increased over time as well.

460
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.650
Right? So we had this or, or we could

461
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.489
talk about some sin. So it's sometimes it is

462
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.560
uh you know, it is going up how much

463
00:27:23.569 --> 00:27:26.020
technocracy we have and sometimes we go back to

464
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.609
this uh majority rule and the will of the

465
00:27:28.619 --> 00:27:31.229
people and this kind of rhetoric in our political

466
00:27:31.239 --> 00:27:31.910
systems.

467
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.030
And by the way, we're going to get more

468
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.459
into checks, democratic checks and balances. But I guess

469
00:27:38.469 --> 00:27:42.119
that uh when people think about them, they usually

470
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.020
think about checks and balances for politicians just for

471
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.540
politicians to not abuse the the power they are

472
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.839
granted by the people, so to speak. But uh

473
00:27:52.849 --> 00:27:57.380
there's also, I guess some checks and balances that

474
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.670
the political system itself tries to keep. Like for

475
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.500
example, there might be certain instances where if we

476
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.260
add uh just a general vote, perhaps a majority

477
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:13.420
of people would vote against the rights of particular

478
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:20.000
minority groups, but that's just not allowed politically. Right.

479
00:28:21.489 --> 00:28:24.089
Well, yes, hopefully. So, you know,

480
00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:27.750
I was just, I was just saying that, um,

481
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.750
sometimes at least, uh, those checks and balances are

482
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.709
also there against even the will or the possible

483
00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:39.589
will of a majority.

484
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.959
Yes. So that's, that's exactly why we have them.

485
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.839
Uh, WE have courts, right. Also that control, uh,

486
00:28:46.849 --> 00:28:51.079
whether the democratic, civic rights of citizens, uh, are

487
00:28:51.089 --> 00:28:53.479
being complied with by the government and also other

488
00:28:53.489 --> 00:28:59.780
actors in society. Um And yeah, another thing about

489
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.810
this, um yeah, how do, how do elites actually

490
00:29:05.819 --> 00:29:08.280
act out upon the rules? I think that's, that's

491
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.000
an important issue. And this is uh uh perhaps

492
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.699
you're familiar with this book by uh Levitsky in

493
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:17.439
the way and they actually uh look at the

494
00:29:17.449 --> 00:29:22.160
American political system and their argument is that what

495
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.020
went wrong in the recent uh electoral waves in

496
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.550
uh or after the recent elections uh in the

497
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.760
US when Trump won the elections was that the

498
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:38.239
elites actually failed in preventing the, the power grab

499
00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:41.479
by that one particular leader who had non democratic

500
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:45.170
intentions. Uh So they point to not only the,

501
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.709
the kind of formal rules or institutional um institutional

502
00:29:49.719 --> 00:29:53.459
constraints, but they point out that the elites themselves

503
00:29:53.469 --> 00:29:56.790
are also responsible for what they do and whom

504
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.060
they encourage and you know what they allow. Uh

505
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.829
And this is maybe more in the territory of

506
00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:06.790
informal rules and then thinking about, OK, given we,

507
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.750
we care about the rights of citizens or assuming

508
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.339
we care about the rights of citizens. We should

509
00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:16.459
not allow such a politician to represent our party,

510
00:30:16.469 --> 00:30:18.989
for example. Right. That, that's the 1st, 1st step

511
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.979
if we know they are non democratic and we

512
00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:25.109
are Democrats, which Republicans would, would claim they are

513
00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:31.030
obviously. Right. Um I think actually in, uh not

514
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.589
even in the authoritarian regimes, the leaders would claim

515
00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.579
that they're authoritarian, they would always claim that they're

516
00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:38.569
democratic. That's, that's another, they

517
00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:41.729
are for the interests of the people,

518
00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:43.790
at least. Exactly. So they would use that, that

519
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.930
side of the definition of democracy, of course to

520
00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:49.099
justify uh the rule. But going back to the

521
00:30:49.109 --> 00:30:51.630
elites is that, um, we have the citizens and

522
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.040
they are in my view, they are crucial as

523
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.739
well in what happens uh in the political realm

524
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.719
of their own country. But we have the elites

525
00:30:59.729 --> 00:31:03.300
who can also take choices that lead either to

526
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.229
the development of democracy or sustaining of democracy or

527
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:07.760
deterioration of democracy.

528
00:31:08.979 --> 00:31:11.500
Yeah, I, I mean, that's something that we hear

529
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:15.739
frequently. I, I don't think that there's any dictator

530
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:20.599
historically or presently out there that ever said that

531
00:31:20.609 --> 00:31:24.430
although I'm only here for my own interests, they

532
00:31:24.439 --> 00:31:28.739
also claim that they are, uh for, uh, they're

533
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.839
fighting for the interests of the people, the will

534
00:31:31.849 --> 00:31:34.609
of the people or something like that or the

535
00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:38.074
nation. I mean, that if they would just say,

536
00:31:38.084 --> 00:31:42.244
oh, no, I, I'm just here to, uh, take

537
00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:47.275
advantage of my own citizens. I guess that they

538
00:31:47.285 --> 00:31:50.734
would probably not last long in their position.

539
00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:53.964
And these are exactly the legitimation strategies. Right. So

540
00:31:53.974 --> 00:31:56.525
why do I have the right to rule? It's,

541
00:31:56.574 --> 00:31:58.844
uh, you know, as an authoritarian leader, I would

542
00:31:58.854 --> 00:32:00.944
never say it's because I want to dominate you

543
00:32:00.954 --> 00:32:03.214
all. And I wanna grab as much power and

544
00:32:03.224 --> 00:32:05.045
as much resources as I can. No, this is

545
00:32:05.055 --> 00:32:07.930
not gonna work. So to be recognized as a

546
00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:10.939
legitimate leader, you have to convince people that you

547
00:32:10.949 --> 00:32:14.479
are actually doing something that is uh um en

548
00:32:14.709 --> 00:32:17.969
enhancing their well being and the will of the

549
00:32:17.979 --> 00:32:20.520
people is one of the arguments again, a very

550
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.069
misguided because what does that mean? Right, there is

551
00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:25.439
no one will of the people ever, even if

552
00:32:25.449 --> 00:32:28.250
you have a homogeneous society, you will have competing

553
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.310
interests. This is just just the way things work.

554
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.089
And Ben An has an uh excellent uh a

555
00:32:35.239 --> 00:32:38.670
broad audience book that came out recently, why politics

556
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.069
fail? And he discusses extensively this idea of, you

557
00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:43.880
know, the will of the people and the misconception

558
00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.050
we have that about that. And that actually you

559
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.260
can never have the will of the people. It's

560
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.069
just not possible, it's how you handle the conflicts

561
00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:55.270
in society that actually shows uh how mature you

562
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.280
are as democratic society, right?

563
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.219
And by the way, let me get into a

564
00:33:00.229 --> 00:33:03.560
very specific topic that perhaps we've already ended up

565
00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:07.800
touching slightly on in our conversation here. But in

566
00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:12.010
your work, for example, you explore the election winner

567
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:15.479
loser gap. So what is that exactly?

568
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.589
Uh THE winner loser gap in terms of um

569
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:26.800
responses to the electoral result um implies that there

570
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.890
are differences in how the winners and losers of

571
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.859
uh elections think or perceive uh the political system

572
00:33:34.869 --> 00:33:38.020
and the political reality more broadly. But also in

573
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.939
the end, how they perceive their own place in

574
00:33:39.949 --> 00:33:43.160
that system, right? So that's, yeah, that I think

575
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.079
that's in short, how you can um you can

576
00:33:46.089 --> 00:33:50.069
specify it. Uh And the research there started uh

577
00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:53.150
with, by, by just looking at whether the winners

578
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.069
and losers of elections are to the same extent

579
00:33:56.079 --> 00:34:00.420
satisfied with democracy. And the gap means that no,

580
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.239
there is a difference between them, right? They, they,

581
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.819
they are not the same satisfied with democracy, they

582
00:34:04.829 --> 00:34:08.010
express uh lower satisfaction if they lose elections and

583
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.520
they express higher satisfaction when they win elections.

584
00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:15.918
So there's a connection to subjective well being here,

585
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.350
right?

586
00:34:16.978 --> 00:34:20.510
So that's uh that's one of the uh endeavors,

587
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.688
let's say of this research that we started with

588
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:24.969
Dimiter Toshkov, who is at the University of uh

589
00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:29.649
Leiden. Um BECAUSE I focused first, so maybe let's

590
00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:31.688
start with, with the, the first part uh about

591
00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.668
democracy and then move to the well being. So

592
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:38.560
uh I started with thinking about the specific elements

593
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.120
of democracy so what we discussed, right, elections, but

594
00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:43.699
also all these checks and balances. So freedom of

595
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:47.408
the media, opposition rights, the right to protest. And

596
00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:51.658
uh my idea coming also from political psychology was

597
00:34:51.668 --> 00:34:56.748
that our coalitional psychology should steer us to pay

598
00:34:56.759 --> 00:35:01.849
more attention or be uh more vigilant about the

599
00:35:01.858 --> 00:35:04.559
violations of checks and balances when we lose elections.

600
00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:07.729
Right? So we already had some indication that uh

601
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.908
maybe the winners of elections like elections more when

602
00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:14.079
they win, right, obviously, but what happens then with

603
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:17.840
these other elements of uh of democracy? And that

604
00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.379
was the 1st, 1st part of this uh study

605
00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:23.500
that we conducted both with observational data with the

606
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.780
European Social Survey, but also with an experiment in

607
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.790
Ukraine where we tried to find out if you

608
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.689
win or lose elections. Does it affect how much

609
00:35:31.699 --> 00:35:35.060
you care about the uh freedom of speech, the

610
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.810
right of opposition, the rights of opposition and uh

611
00:35:38.189 --> 00:35:42.489
uh the media criticism against the government. And indeed,

612
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.469
we found consistently that um there is an effect

613
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.629
that when you lose, you care more about constraining

614
00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:53.739
the power, which makes sense, right? These effects are

615
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.620
not necessarily huge but they are there. And this

616
00:35:56.629 --> 00:36:00.620
also implies that our ideas about democracy or how

617
00:36:00.629 --> 00:36:03.310
much we value it is not something stable, this

618
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.300
is something conditional depending on the environment in which

619
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.239
we are uh operating and that was the starting

620
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.550
point. But then we thought, OK, so um you

621
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.600
know, winning and losing elections. It's a little bit

622
00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.959
like, like sports, like playing a game, but with

623
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:22.780
higher stakes and we have evidence from uh all

624
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:28.080
kinds of physiological studies, psychosomatic uh evaluations that people

625
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.659
respond uh physically to winning and losing, at least

626
00:36:32.669 --> 00:36:35.090
in sports. But we also have evidence from uh

627
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.729
all kinds of coalition of winning and losing among

628
00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:41.729
animals that show um that there should be some

629
00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:46.179
effect on also well being or uh at least

630
00:36:46.189 --> 00:36:48.639
in terms of stress hormones being released, right? So

631
00:36:48.649 --> 00:36:52.159
how, how our body responds to winning and losing?

632
00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:55.110
I said, well, let's see whether at least um

633
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.409
in terms of attitudinal responses, we find that uh

634
00:36:58.419 --> 00:37:00.620
that effect. So we did not study the physiology

635
00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:03.070
of winning and losing, but we studied the attitudes

636
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.510
of citizens. And indeed, we found out that when

637
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.229
you are losing elections, you feel less optimistic, um

638
00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:15.459
You feel uh at least you evaluate your, your

639
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:19.719
health as worse than when you win elections. And

640
00:37:19.729 --> 00:37:22.229
this was done also with observational data from the

641
00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:26.370
European Social survey that that was conducted uh twice,

642
00:37:26.379 --> 00:37:28.800
at least we looked at 22 data sets from

643
00:37:28.989 --> 00:37:32.590
2012 and 2018. And this also allowed us to

644
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.469
have the shifts uh between the losers and winners,

645
00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:38.780
right? So different parties were uh in charge in

646
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.689
2012 then in 2018. So the who was the

647
00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:43.750
winner and who was the loser also changed there.

648
00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.100
So we accounted for, for that in, in that

649
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.469
study design. Again, these effects are not huge, but

650
00:37:50.629 --> 00:37:53.889
it shows that there is really something there uh

651
00:37:53.899 --> 00:37:56.110
that we need to pay attention to in terms

652
00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.939
of uh thinking about our values, uh democratic values,

653
00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:06.219
right? And their stability. And then the, I don't,

654
00:38:06.229 --> 00:38:08.899
I don't really like the word biases but, you

655
00:38:08.909 --> 00:38:11.100
know, the biases that we have depending on which

656
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.760
side of the coalition we are. I don't think

657
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.250
there are really biases because it's justified to be

658
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.969
more worried when you lose. Right. Um, WELL, your

659
00:38:18.979 --> 00:38:21.620
rights will be constrained at the moment that, uh,

660
00:38:21.629 --> 00:38:27.010
the opponent wins, uh, or no, will suddenly you

661
00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.600
have to watch out what you say when the

662
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:36.489
opponent, uh, the opponent wins. It's your job then,

663
00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:41.090
uh, at stake, right? If you disagree with your

664
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.750
boss and, you know, he supports the, a particular

665
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.300
party or is connected to a particular party. So

666
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.679
I, I wouldn't call it a bias but then,

667
00:38:47.689 --> 00:38:50.330
you know, the, um, yeah, how, how would you

668
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.110
call it? It's, it's not really a bias if

669
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.709
it's totally justified, but basically the shift. So, so

670
00:38:55.719 --> 00:38:59.060
the, the responsiveness of these values that some thought

671
00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.530
are maybe very stable add in the literature.

672
00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:06.669
Mhm. Yeah, it's not a bias if it's totally

673
00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:09.209
justified. I mean, that's, that's a very interesting point

674
00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:12.020
be because I was actually going to ask you.

675
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.000
So, uh, at a certain point there, you mentioned

676
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.639
that if you are uh a loser, sometimes you

677
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:25.110
want more constraints on the political system, the political

678
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.020
power and perhaps that would sometimes imply constraints on

679
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:34.679
democracy or democratic processes. But uh I mean, uh

680
00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:39.760
but particularly if you have particular interests in mind,

681
00:39:39.939 --> 00:39:44.459
like for example, protecting the rights of certain groups

682
00:39:44.469 --> 00:39:49.199
of people that after the democratic process are under

683
00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:55.280
threat. For example, perhaps having that impulse to really

684
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.909
want some constraints on the established political power, even

685
00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:04.870
if it's under a democratic regime might not be

686
00:40:04.879 --> 00:40:08.600
that bad, right? When you want to protect perhaps

687
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.820
the rights of certain people and even sometimes not

688
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:16.820
necessarily just minorities, but even a majority of people

689
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:21.929
that might suddenly see their rights taken away or

690
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:28.239
reps being put under economic and social pressure depending

691
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.800
on the measures or the policies that the particular

692
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.199
political power party in power uh takes.

693
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.399
Yeah. So the losers want to contest the power

694
00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:41.770
more. So they are actually supporting the checks and

695
00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:47.030
balances more and you know, normative. Well, uh it

696
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.360
depends, right? If you think that uh we should

697
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.330
go for the liberal democracy, then normative, this is

698
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.729
the right thing to do to actually contest the

699
00:40:55.739 --> 00:40:59.070
powerful if they're trying to harm uh particular groups

700
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.429
in society. Um Yeah, and of course, uh the

701
00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:07.770
problem is then that if you get the majority

702
00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:13.020
government that wants to eliminate or limit these constraints,

703
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.409
then you have a clash, right? So what you

704
00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:20.689
see is uh maybe we should talk about some

705
00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.030
kind of uh gradual development of the political regimes

706
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.739
then that uh when one path of uh influencing

707
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.879
the government or constraining the government is closed, another

708
00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:35.169
one is being opened or when one right is

709
00:41:35.179 --> 00:41:38.909
being uh limited, then you go for still the

710
00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:41.219
things that are available in the public space, right?

711
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.540
So thinking about what happened in Poland with uh

712
00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:47.370
at least in the first term of the Law

713
00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:49.790
and Justice Party when they started constraining the rights

714
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.649
of women. Um WOMEN went out massively to protest

715
00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:58.270
the protest, right was uh available. It was not

716
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.870
constrained yet, right? So they could use that civic

717
00:42:01.879 --> 00:42:06.120
right to express their disagreement with the government. That

718
00:42:06.129 --> 00:42:09.280
was actually something that worked unfortunately, only short term

719
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.699
because in the second term uh of rule, the

720
00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:16.189
law and justice went further with constraining the women's

721
00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:18.780
rights. But you can see that the women still

722
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.709
had the option, they took their rights and they

723
00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:22.689
went out to protest, not only women, by the

724
00:42:22.699 --> 00:42:26.550
way, uh men also supported their uh actions massively.

725
00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:30.320
And then you have situations like in Russia where

726
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.199
coming out to protest at some point is no

727
00:42:33.209 --> 00:42:37.429
longer possible, right? Because it is you put yourself

728
00:42:37.439 --> 00:42:40.239
in really huge danger and then it's uh basically

729
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.699
your uh your assessment of uh your risk and

730
00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:46.989
gains that you can get from actually taking that

731
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.760
action, right? Um So the, the longer we allow

732
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.770
the government to take the rights away and to

733
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.129
constrain the checks and balances, the less likely it

734
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:59.629
is that we will be able to pay the

735
00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:01.729
cost of coming out and protesting and pay the

736
00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:05.030
cost of actually opposing that government to the extent

737
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.040
that at some point it's just no longer even

738
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:11.149
considered, right, an option only by those who are,

739
00:43:11.159 --> 00:43:12.929
I don't know either the bravest or have the

740
00:43:12.939 --> 00:43:13.760
least to lose.

741
00:43:14.409 --> 00:43:18.110
Mhm So we've already talked a little bit about

742
00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.229
that here. But what are some of the main

743
00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:26.679
factors that influence citizen support for democratic checks and

744
00:43:26.689 --> 00:43:30.040
balances? And I read in your work for example,

745
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:35.280
about effects of partisanship and economic performance. So could

746
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.330
you tell us about that?

747
00:43:37.139 --> 00:43:39.959
Yes, of course. So this is also again a

748
00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:42.129
research that I do in the stream of other

749
00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:44.239
research that has been done before, right? So I

750
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.610
build on, on some of the work that inspired

751
00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:50.070
it. And one of the, the papers that I

752
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.560
was inspired by was a Matthew singer's paper that

753
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:57.070
who looks at the developments in Latin American countries.

754
00:43:57.479 --> 00:44:02.810
And he observed that when the perceived performance of

755
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:07.139
economy by the government uh is being evaluated as,

756
00:44:07.149 --> 00:44:09.879
as high. So the economy is doing well in

757
00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:12.639
the eyes of citizens, then they are more likely

758
00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:16.189
to grant more power to these governments. So basically

759
00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:19.120
that means that they allow the government to uh

760
00:44:19.129 --> 00:44:23.070
execute uh reforms that then increase the power of

761
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.219
that government. And it could be, you know, in

762
00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:30.120
terms of uh presidential powers expansion uh or uh

763
00:44:30.129 --> 00:44:33.540
limiting to what extent you have to care about

764
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.080
the parliament, right? That's one of the things that

765
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.689
you can imagine. Um So that was, that was

766
00:44:38.699 --> 00:44:42.459
the thing that uh that inspired in my research,

767
00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:46.649
which I also took further with experimental designs. And

768
00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:49.489
here you see that the economy is uh is

769
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.000
the factor that he emphasized and also losing winning.

770
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.850
So whether you support the government or you do

771
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.739
not support the government. So uh no coalition of

772
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.790
thinking is what I derived from that. And they

773
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.330
are both very important and I indeed find uh

774
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:08.090
uh find evidence, both observational and uh experimental that

775
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.090
uh when the economy is performing well, then citizens

776
00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.820
are a bit less vigilant. So they are uh

777
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:21.070
more OK with uh for example, constraining the independence

778
00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:27.010
of courts, right? Um THEY are more willing to

779
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.189
give up this right to constrain the government and

780
00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:34.510
similarly the losing, winning uh effect. So this is

781
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.959
what we just discussed. The coalition will effect is

782
00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.459
that if you lose the elections, then you are

783
00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:44.469
paying more attention to uh to the government and

784
00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:46.379
what they do and you wanna keep this right

785
00:45:46.389 --> 00:45:49.790
to constrain them. So you are, they are finding

786
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:56.030
those more important elements of democracy. Uh And yeah,

787
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.080
maybe one thing to, to follow up on that

788
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:04.889
is that this is also linked to. Um AT

789
00:46:04.899 --> 00:46:07.699
least one of my studies shows some evidence of

790
00:46:07.709 --> 00:46:13.860
that um that when we look at the opponent

791
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:19.540
introducing a particular reform, we see more malicious intentions

792
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.500
of that reform when it's about the checks and

793
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.479
balances. When it's about democracy, when we have a

794
00:46:24.489 --> 00:46:27.719
person with whom we align, we have the party

795
00:46:27.729 --> 00:46:30.739
rule that we like or the party that, you

796
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.379
know, we feel strongly attached to is in charge.

797
00:46:33.389 --> 00:46:36.429
Then we are uh thinking that their intentions are

798
00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:39.659
benign. And to give you an example when um

799
00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:44.489
when you are facing this uh proposals of political

800
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.189
reforms or changes that the politicians want to introduce,

801
00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:50.030
they can give you all kinds of reasons. And

802
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.050
as we discussed before, nobody will say that they

803
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.459
have an undemocratic reason behind it, right? They will

804
00:46:55.469 --> 00:46:57.790
always say this is to do something good, something

805
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.909
positive. When uh there is a proposal for reform

806
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:05.540
of protest rights. For example, the common argument that

807
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.320
you can find by politicians is is to increase

808
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.659
the safety of citizens who doesn't like safety, right?

809
00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:14.000
Then the opponents will say well, but this is

810
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.399
then limiting our possibility or making it more difficult

811
00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:18.899
for us to come out to the street and

812
00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:22.149
protest against you. So now as a citizen, you

813
00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:24.649
are standing there and like, yeah, well, safety, good

814
00:47:24.659 --> 00:47:27.699
reason uh having the right to protest. Good reason

815
00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:31.860
who is proposing it. Ah my opponent. So probably

816
00:47:31.969 --> 00:47:33.979
they are actually wanting to limit me, right. So

817
00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:36.959
you see the, the, the malicious intention behind it

818
00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:40.030
uh if you won the elections and this is

819
00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.830
the party that you like, who is proposing. It's

820
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.560
like, oh, that's, that's a fair argument. Safety is

821
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.969
very important. Uh So you see the benign uh

822
00:47:47.979 --> 00:47:51.679
intention behind that proposal or you are more likely

823
00:47:51.689 --> 00:47:54.850
to see that. Now, there are also differences between

824
00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.840
the supporters of different political parties. Uh So some,

825
00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.540
you know, some just care less, some care more

826
00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.510
about democracy. But in general, this effect holds for

827
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.060
everybody. Right. So if you are winning or losing,

828
00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.229
it determines what kind of intentions you see behind

829
00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:13.620
the proposals of the government.

830
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.679
Mhm So there's also two concepts here that I

831
00:48:18.689 --> 00:48:21.090
would like to ask you about that probably play

832
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.750
a very important role in democracy and o other

833
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.889
political regimes by the way. But in the context

834
00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:33.379
of political science, what is civil society? What does

835
00:48:33.389 --> 00:48:34.800
it mean exactly?

836
00:48:35.169 --> 00:48:37.439
I think that's another concept that we could discuss

837
00:48:37.449 --> 00:48:40.580
for, for an hour or so, at least. Um

838
00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.919
AND there is really a lot of scholarship that

839
00:48:42.929 --> 00:48:45.860
um that tries to define it and tries to

840
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.909
also uh distill the effects of civil society on

841
00:48:48.919 --> 00:48:54.550
democracy. But in general, uh civil civil society encompasses

842
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.969
all kinds of organizational associational life that is distinct

843
00:48:58.979 --> 00:49:02.709
from politics and business. OK. Right. So this would

844
00:49:02.719 --> 00:49:06.870
be all kinds of organizations or associations um that

845
00:49:06.879 --> 00:49:11.159
uh bring together citizens for particular goals, but they

846
00:49:11.169 --> 00:49:14.300
are not attempting to get power and they are

847
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:18.149
not just pushing lobbying for particular business interests. And

848
00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:21.370
it can be really anything that goes under that

849
00:49:21.379 --> 00:49:24.129
label. So that's why it's a very problematic concept.

850
00:49:24.139 --> 00:49:27.270
Uh CON uh concept sometimes to, to think about

851
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.949
because it could be, you know, a circle of

852
00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:36.379
uh village uh I don't know, knitting funds, right?

853
00:49:36.709 --> 00:49:41.360
Or it could be actually uh uh an organization,

854
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.250
non governmental organization that monitors the transparency of decision

855
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.320
making that monitors the corruption levels. That could also

856
00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:52.010
be uh um an NGO right, or a civil

857
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.979
society, non governmental organization. Uh And because of that

858
00:49:55.989 --> 00:50:00.209
this uh organizations or this, this uh civil society

859
00:50:00.219 --> 00:50:04.149
space can have either stronger or less strong effects

860
00:50:04.159 --> 00:50:08.350
on democracy, right? So there are some that argue

861
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.879
that actually even this kind of network of citizens

862
00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:15.409
that is not necessarily aimed at monitoring the politicians,

863
00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:19.280
like, you know, uh people who have specific hobbies

864
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.959
or do sports together that even this is already

865
00:50:21.969 --> 00:50:25.500
something that is uh creating a very valuable addition

866
00:50:25.554 --> 00:50:29.354
to democracy because it creates interpersonal trust. So that

867
00:50:29.364 --> 00:50:34.264
would be Putnam's argument, right? Uh Bowling alone when

868
00:50:34.274 --> 00:50:37.294
we don't go anymore with our friends, the uh

869
00:50:37.304 --> 00:50:40.774
the kind of fabric of our society disintegrates and

870
00:50:40.784 --> 00:50:43.004
that has has a negative effect also then on

871
00:50:43.014 --> 00:50:46.459
the institutional trust, for example, there are others who

872
00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:49.159
argue that actually what matters is these organizations that

873
00:50:49.169 --> 00:50:54.449
are strictly um targeting the political, the monitoring of

874
00:50:54.459 --> 00:50:58.239
political institutions. Uh And this could be, as I

875
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:01.159
said, uh you know, anti corruption and monitoring or

876
00:51:01.169 --> 00:51:07.850
human rights monitoring organizations. Um TO some extent, maybe

877
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.729
you could think of some that uh analyze. So,

878
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:12.850
so all kinds of think tanks that analyze uh

879
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.199
the merits of policies that are also checking the

880
00:51:16.209 --> 00:51:19.330
politicians, right, if you have some complex scientific issue,

881
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.929
and then there is maybe a proposal that violates

882
00:51:22.939 --> 00:51:27.489
the most recent findings or our established knowledge, scientific

883
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.479
knowledge, they could uh contest these decisions, for example,

884
00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:33.590
right? So this would also fall under uh civil

885
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.250
society.

886
00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:37.889
Mhm Yeah, it's very interesting that you mentioned at

887
00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:40.810
a certain point there, for example, just the simple

888
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.010
fact that some people play sports together and how

889
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.919
that leads to interpersonal trust and it can have

890
00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:53.149
certain political effects because I was also thinking that

891
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.189
uh I mean, on the one hand, there are,

892
00:51:56.199 --> 00:52:00.360
for example, people that say or claim that everything

893
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:05.229
is political, which perhaps is a little bit exaggerated.

894
00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:07.850
But uh on the one, on the other hand,

895
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.120
it points to a very important effect. I guess

896
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:17.540
that is uh probably many of the things that

897
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.139
we do in our lives, how we conduct ourselves,

898
00:52:20.149 --> 00:52:23.739
how we interact with other people in society, even

899
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:29.030
though they might not have any direct political expression,

900
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.459
might translate uh politically or into political behaviors. And

901
00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:38.679
for example, I guess that you mentioned uh interpersonal

902
00:52:38.689 --> 00:52:42.330
trust and sports there, I guess that on the

903
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.959
other extreme, on the other end of the spectrum

904
00:52:45.969 --> 00:52:50.800
in modern uh industrialized and post industrial society is

905
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:55.250
a very common phenomenon is for people to manifest

906
00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.010
uh loneliness. And we, I think particularly in bigger

907
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.620
cities, a more atomized society which perhaps sometimes we

908
00:53:03.629 --> 00:53:09.459
don't link that directly to political behaviors necessarily, but

909
00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:14.770
that might have uh political effects. Uh Even if

910
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.770
it's just sometimes the fact that people might get

911
00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.939
politically disengaged.

912
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.000
Yes, for sure. You are, you're completely right. And

913
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.050
there is really a lot that we still don't

914
00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.449
know about the effect of um yeah, the move

915
00:53:30.459 --> 00:53:34.330
of our lives online on, on the communities and

916
00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:37.550
then how that affects in the end um you

917
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.209
know, our perception of what creates this clas, right?

918
00:53:41.219 --> 00:53:43.610
So who are these, these people with whom we

919
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.495
are actually creating a political ecosystem? And uh yeah,

920
00:53:47.504 --> 00:53:49.475
it starts with these communities and you, you can

921
00:53:49.485 --> 00:53:51.794
think it's uh you know, a little bit outrageous,

922
00:53:51.804 --> 00:53:55.274
how come a sports club can actually uh have

923
00:53:55.284 --> 00:53:59.854
any effect on, on larger democracies on remote institutional

924
00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:04.860
system, but it is about interacting with people. And

925
00:54:05.149 --> 00:54:07.699
it also depends probably on the type of club

926
00:54:07.709 --> 00:54:10.219
you are participating and how diverse that club is,

927
00:54:10.229 --> 00:54:12.290
how large it is, what kind of network you

928
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.590
are creating. But imagine a running club. This is

929
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.060
what I am familiar with. I would in my

930
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:22.169
normal, you know, online uh day or day with

931
00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:25.419
students who are also a very particular particular population.

932
00:54:25.429 --> 00:54:28.510
I would not encounter this diversity of people as

933
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.429
I encounter in my running club, right? Even the

934
00:54:31.439 --> 00:54:33.370
fact what kind of jobs they do is sometimes

935
00:54:33.379 --> 00:54:35.100
to be surprised that all this exists and these

936
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.989
people, you know, have these problems, these people uh

937
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:41.070
you know, are engaged in this kind of activities.

938
00:54:41.409 --> 00:54:43.590
So this creates already some kind of idea about

939
00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.729
who we are a society and it creates bonds.

940
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.520
There is also the problem that you might have

941
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:54.189
uh this very homogeneous groups that have very specific

942
00:54:54.199 --> 00:54:57.629
goals uh And they do not interact with others.

943
00:54:57.639 --> 00:54:59.969
And here we, we come to or, or maybe

944
00:54:59.979 --> 00:55:07.199
even an antagonistic towards others, right? Um And let's

945
00:55:07.209 --> 00:55:12.020
say the online space has advantages and disadvantages in

946
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.909
creating groups. They can, they can introduce more pluralism,

947
00:55:14.919 --> 00:55:19.800
but they can also create uh the idea that

948
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:24.010
these more extreme voices or more excluding voices are

949
00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.850
uh more prevalent. So you find easier, these people

950
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.520
with extreme ideas just because there is a lot

951
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.570
of information, there is a lot of people that

952
00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.760
you would never encounter in your real life there

953
00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.679
and you can bond with them as well, right?

954
00:55:39.149 --> 00:55:43.479
So this, this creates perhaps another uh yeah, another

955
00:55:43.489 --> 00:55:46.419
impulse into this civil society space that we are

956
00:55:46.429 --> 00:55:48.790
talking about. So I think we still don't know

957
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.860
exactly how the online spaces will uh in the

958
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:57.739
end affect both our interactions in these communities, um

959
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.500
the the offline communities, but also then uh how

960
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:07.750
they will steer um yeah, democratic engagement or maybe,

961
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:11.699
yeah, negative engagement. And to give you an example

962
00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:14.719
from, again, the research that I did um in

963
00:56:14.729 --> 00:56:17.919
the Post Soviet space and also in, in Russia.

964
00:56:18.409 --> 00:56:23.489
Um WE, we have such a term as uncivil

965
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.580
society. Again, I am not sure whether this is

966
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:29.909
a fair uh fair term, fair concept. But uh

967
00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:35.580
this usually refers to those organizations that are very

968
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:42.159
exclusive, that um engage citizens on the basis of

969
00:56:42.169 --> 00:56:49.419
particular criteria like ethnicity um or values, you know,

970
00:56:49.429 --> 00:56:54.320
for example, conservative orthodox church values uh and vision

971
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:57.719
of the world. So for example, this engagement with

972
00:56:57.729 --> 00:57:01.239
the West uh as being the the evil influence

973
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:05.250
versus, you know, engagement with some kind of Slavic

974
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.479
Orthodox traditional base, right? So based on very exclusive

975
00:57:09.489 --> 00:57:14.060
identity um that is present in these post Soviet

976
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:17.270
countries and this is referred to sometimes as uncivil

977
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.969
society, there are different reasons for that. One is

978
00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:23.560
the the type of values that they promote and

979
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.820
these values can be attractive to people, right? Conservative

980
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:30.110
values, religious values. This is not something that again

981
00:57:30.389 --> 00:57:35.739
is immediately normative uh wrong, they are not progressive

982
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:38.320
values. So then again, if you take a normative

983
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.620
stand, we should aim at improvement rather than uh

984
00:57:41.629 --> 00:57:44.969
you know, living the way we are uh or

985
00:57:44.979 --> 00:57:47.129
yeah, living in the state that we are in,

986
00:57:47.709 --> 00:57:52.060
then it becomes a debate. But the purely normative

987
00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:55.350
there doesn't have to be a judgment there. So

988
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.949
these organizations attract those kind of people. But then

989
00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:02.250
the problem and I think that's why they are

990
00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.780
often called uncivil is that they are very often

991
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:08.000
also stimulated by particular state actors. And then we

992
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:11.530
get into this territory, territory of, you know, can

993
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.500
they still be called civil society because they are

994
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:18.429
influenced and very often funded and also supported by

995
00:58:18.439 --> 00:58:21.159
the state actors. And here um in this post

996
00:58:21.169 --> 00:58:23.850
Soviet space, this is uh the influence of the

997
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.439
Russian state that promotes this kind of organizations that

998
00:58:27.449 --> 00:58:30.570
then actually also promoted their values and their ideas

999
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.020
about the world in the post Soviet space countries

1000
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.360
such as Belarus Ukraine or Moldova, which I uh

1001
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:40.120
researched. Um Yeah, and then, then we get to

1002
00:58:40.129 --> 00:58:43.439
the point. OK. So are the civil civil society

1003
00:58:43.449 --> 00:58:47.100
organizations? Can we, can we always assume that these

1004
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:52.419
organizations within society would promote democracy not necessarily, right?

1005
00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:57.189
Because if the status quo is not democracy and

1006
00:58:57.199 --> 00:58:59.899
these organizations are conservative, they want to preserve the

1007
00:58:59.909 --> 00:59:02.419
status quo. It means we are not gonna gonna

1008
00:59:02.429 --> 00:59:06.419
move towards more democratic, open inclusive society.

1009
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.850
Mhm No, you know, I for me, this is

1010
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.780
a very interesting topic. Uh AND I mentioned earlier,

1011
00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:18.090
for example, bigger cities and a more atomized society

1012
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.110
because I guess that in this particular case, what

1013
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.610
I were, what I was referring to was not

1014
00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:28.949
just the fact of people in particular situations, perhaps

1015
00:59:28.959 --> 00:59:34.270
not wanting to engage with society, with politics anymore

1016
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.030
because of their particular situation, but also how the

1017
00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:43.649
particular political, economic and social context leads people to

1018
00:59:43.659 --> 00:59:47.320
those kinds of situations. Like for example, one thing

1019
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.120
that I'm very interested in in is the phenomenon

1020
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:55.169
of Hikikomori in Japan. That is the so-called shut

1021
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.770
ins. That is something that went up or became

1022
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.479
a more, more of a phenomenon after the economic

1023
01:00:03.489 --> 01:00:06.689
crisis in the late eighties where people were used

1024
01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:11.100
to just go uh complete their university degrees and

1025
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.050
then get us accepted into one of the leading

1026
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.830
companies in Japan and be there for life. I

1027
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.610
mean, completely stable jobs, no job insecurity, good economic

1028
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.800
pros prospects, the prospect of building a family and

1029
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.800
all of that. And then suddenly they lost that.

1030
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:35.429
And now there's 1 million plus people in Japan

1031
01:00:35.439 --> 01:00:39.949
that just withdraw from society. They live at home

1032
01:00:39.959 --> 01:00:43.520
in their room and they just say that they

1033
01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:47.840
want, they don't want win with society anymore. They,

1034
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.979
they don't want to engage with people anymore. They

1035
01:00:50.989 --> 01:00:54.360
are perhaps on the internet, but that's uh the

1036
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:57.919
most they get from even if we can call

1037
01:00:57.929 --> 01:01:04.199
them social interaction. And also sometimes I uh watch

1038
01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:08.330
videos that some people make with homeless people in

1039
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.649
the US. And some of them also mentioned more

1040
01:01:11.659 --> 01:01:13.800
or less the same. They say look, I'm, I'm

1041
01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:16.919
done with society. I'm done with politics. I don't

1042
01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:19.459
care anymore. So, uh, I mean, it's a, it's

1043
01:01:19.469 --> 01:01:23.159
a very sad situation but it's also, I guess,

1044
01:01:23.169 --> 01:01:26.739
uh, a symptom and a manifestation many times of

1045
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:34.409
how, being economically, politically and socially disenfranchised where that

1046
01:01:34.419 --> 01:01:37.310
leads people or can lead people.

1047
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:42.750
Yes, for sure. And I think, um, economic safety

1048
01:01:43.149 --> 01:01:47.370
is also in a way a precondition for active

1049
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:51.610
participation in politics. Right. So, yes, there are situations

1050
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.739
where those who are disadvantaged actually stand up and

1051
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.659
protest, usually it is led actually by those who

1052
01:01:58.669 --> 01:02:02.445
have more capacity to do so uh that also,

1053
01:02:02.655 --> 01:02:05.614
you know, involves, I don't know, maybe the the

1054
01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:08.804
uh suffrage rights for, for women, right? When, when

1055
01:02:08.814 --> 01:02:10.935
you had these women that started, that were be

1056
01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:14.665
better off, that started mobilizing the interest. But also

1057
01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:18.264
uh even when you think about the Marxist revolutions,

1058
01:02:18.274 --> 01:02:22.165
right? This was the elites that drove actually the

1059
01:02:22.175 --> 01:02:26.739
uh action for the rights of the workers. So

1060
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:29.580
the workers were too busy working, right? Or uh

1061
01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:31.479
when you think about people who are in very

1062
01:02:31.489 --> 01:02:35.739
grave uh uh economic situation, they don't have time

1063
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:39.419
to simply come out to the streets and uh

1064
01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:42.419
you know, engage with this uh with this. Yeah,

1065
01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:46.560
political processes, they also, of course, can be completely

1066
01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:49.409
disenchanted and think it doesn't matter, you know. Uh

1067
01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:53.389
FIRST there was uh Gorbachev, then there was Yeltsin,

1068
01:02:53.399 --> 01:02:55.550
then there was putting nothing changes in my life.

1069
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.629
Why would I ever actually participate in politics. It

1070
01:02:58.639 --> 01:03:02.469
doesn't affect me directly. This is also very dangerous,

1071
01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.780
of course, because then, um you know, you might

1072
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:09.350
end up with a regime that uh uses violence

1073
01:03:09.929 --> 01:03:13.090
uh in your name, but you do not uh

1074
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.320
identify with that, right? So this is what many

1075
01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:18.830
Russians are probably facing at the moment because a

1076
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.989
lot of the society was completely dis dis attached

1077
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.780
from politics. They thought this is none of their

1078
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.649
business politics is for politicians. Real life is for

1079
01:03:27.659 --> 01:03:30.790
for normal citizens. But at some point, you then

1080
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.989
end up in a situation when your government is

1081
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.070
taking decisions in your name that uh that are

1082
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.629
horrible, right? Uh But in the end, it is

1083
01:03:39.639 --> 01:03:42.469
about this ability to participate in politics and you

1084
01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:44.570
can only do it when you have some sort

1085
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.649
of well being. So it is not for nothing

1086
01:03:46.659 --> 01:03:50.939
that we have this ongoing debate. Does economic development

1087
01:03:50.949 --> 01:03:54.040
come first or democracy come first, right? What, what

1088
01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:58.060
should, what should we achieve first to actually um

1089
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:02.320
yeah, better the lives of more people. Uh And

1090
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:05.379
then, yeah, your example with, with the US and

1091
01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:09.429
the homeless people, this also shows that, you know,

1092
01:04:09.439 --> 01:04:12.969
the social democracies that actually provide the safety nets

1093
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:17.179
might encourage more political participation just purely because they

1094
01:04:17.189 --> 01:04:21.419
give more people the capacity to participate in politics.

1095
01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:25.080
Uh And I think if, if we uh kind

1096
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.679
of trace the development also within, within Europe, of

1097
01:04:28.689 --> 01:04:30.719
different countries. You can see that, right, that there

1098
01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:33.770
is more engagement even if we just look purely

1099
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.909
at um how many people vote. So the turnout

1100
01:04:36.919 --> 01:04:41.250
numbers um for elections that this comes with also

1101
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.739
uh the, the, the functioning welfare state in the

1102
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.110
end.

1103
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.320
Yeah. And I guess that this is also probably

1104
01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:53.040
one of the reasons why when there are revolutions,

1105
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:57.600
it's usually a middle class people leading them because

1106
01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:01.699
they have at least enough stability to be able

1107
01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:06.020
to devote resources into that kind of level of

1108
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.290
political participation. Exactly.

1109
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.020
Yeah, they can afford it simply. Yeah.

1110
01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:14.149
Yeah. And so we were talking about civil society

1111
01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:17.010
here. Uh But on the other hand, we also

1112
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.399
have external actors. So what are external actors? And

1113
01:05:21.409 --> 01:05:24.370
by the way, what is the interplay here between

1114
01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.830
civil society and external actors?

1115
01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:32.530
Um SO there can be different types of external

1116
01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.120
actors and external meaning, you know, this is not

1117
01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:38.350
an actor that necessarily is vested within some domestic

1118
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:44.090
policy sphere, right? Um And for the actor that

1119
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.050
I looked the most at was the European Union

1120
01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:51.870
and Russia as different well uh entities. So one

1121
01:05:51.879 --> 01:05:53.820
is an organization of states, the other one is

1122
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:58.189
a state that actually try to promote their interests

1123
01:05:58.199 --> 01:06:03.179
in other countries, right? So they enact particular uh

1124
01:06:03.189 --> 01:06:07.040
strategies or policies outside of the boundaries of this

1125
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.439
organization of their or their own state. And one

1126
01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:12.790
of the examples was exactly this uh uh civil

1127
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:18.959
society actors that promote particular uh conservative Russian orthodox

1128
01:06:18.969 --> 01:06:23.399
uh Russian speakers values in the what Russia calls.

1129
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.939
Uh And this is also uh uh not uh

1130
01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:30.199
approved by the countries themselves, of course, but the

1131
01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:34.419
Russia course they're near abroad um kind of diminishing

1132
01:06:34.429 --> 01:06:37.719
the the agency and sovereignty of the States in

1133
01:06:37.729 --> 01:06:41.179
their neighborhood. Um And then what is the neighborhood,

1134
01:06:41.189 --> 01:06:43.949
the Eastern neighborhoods of the European Union? So the

1135
01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.719
European Union calls it the Eastern Partnership countries, right?

1136
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.820
So this would be two actors that have some

1137
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:55.939
sort of state formal organization, uh they are external,

1138
01:06:55.949 --> 01:06:58.909
but there can also be external actors or perceived

1139
01:06:58.919 --> 01:07:04.179
as external. Um THAT we all know also uh

1140
01:07:04.189 --> 01:07:08.239
from all the literature on globalization such as international,

1141
01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:11.770
non governmental organizations, right? So it could be, I

1142
01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:16.820
don't know, Amnesty International um uh MS F so

1143
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.760
doctors without borders, right? These are also external actors

1144
01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:24.409
that can come to another country and provide services,

1145
01:07:24.419 --> 01:07:28.949
promote some values, um protect some rights. Uh It

1146
01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:32.709
could even be, of course uh uh environmental organizations

1147
01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:35.879
such as uh World Wildlife Fund, for example, right.

1148
01:07:36.479 --> 01:07:38.239
So these are external actors.

1149
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.229
Uh And so I would like to get now

1150
01:07:42.239 --> 01:07:46.820
into the topic of legitimacy, but just before that,

1151
01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:51.219
we've been focusing a lot on democracies here. But

1152
01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:54.260
what are hybrid regimes?

1153
01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:58.939
Well, hybrid regimes are regimes that combine elements of

1154
01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:03.760
democracy and authoritarianism. Again, this is a very kind

1155
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:08.260
of uh shadow sphere of uh regime classification, right?

1156
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:12.820
So it's very difficult to determine when one regime

1157
01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:15.810
is still a democracy and not yet authoritarian. And

1158
01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.759
then when they are really consolidated authoritarian regime and

1159
01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:25.419
uh regimes such as Russia somewhere mm between the

1160
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:27.569
end of the 19 nineties and the beginning of

1161
01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.910
two thousands were often referred to as hybrid regimes.

1162
01:08:31.029 --> 01:08:35.169
Also Venezuela of uh Hugo Chavez was classified as

1163
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.299
a hybrid regime. And this is because the uh

1164
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:43.569
the regime still kept elections they kept or the,

1165
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.600
you know, the those who ruled this regime, they

1166
01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:48.939
kept elections, they kept organizing them. There was some

1167
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:54.160
contestation, although increasingly limited and there was still some

1168
01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:57.270
pluralism in the public sphere in terms of the

1169
01:08:57.279 --> 01:09:02.180
media. So there were constraints on these checks and

1170
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:05.979
balances like the media and the organization of uh

1171
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:09.919
political parties, for example, but it was still much

1172
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:12.819
more pluralistic than in what we understand as a

1173
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:16.040
classical authoritarian regime or dictatorial regime where you just

1174
01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:19.080
have one party or one ruler that dictates everything

1175
01:09:19.209 --> 01:09:21.669
by, by the way, in, in the particular case

1176
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.240
of Venezuela. Now with Maduro in power, is it

1177
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:29.279
still classified as a hybrid regime?

1178
01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:32.729
I think now it's already classified as authoritarian regime.

1179
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.700
I again, as I say, this is a very

1180
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:37.689
difficult situation to uh to know where exactly the

1181
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.089
tipping point is something that we still have to

1182
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.359
uh to determine. But I think uh the best

1183
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:46.189
way to check that is to look at uh

1184
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.589
research of uh v varieties of democracies who monitor

1185
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.140
over time the changes in the regime. So then

1186
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:55.689
you can actually determine where the, the, the tipping

1187
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.779
point happen, right?

1188
01:09:57.959 --> 01:09:59.850
Uh By the way, I, I'm not sure if

1189
01:09:59.859 --> 01:10:02.459
you were going to say something else when I

1190
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:05.770
interrupted you to ask you about uh the regime

1191
01:10:05.779 --> 01:10:07.180
in Venezuela or

1192
01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.250
no, I think uh I think that's, that's all

1193
01:10:10.259 --> 01:10:12.370
right. Well, what, what we did uh also in,

1194
01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.490
in this one of the, the research uh comparative

1195
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.060
research pieces that uh we conducted was to compare

1196
01:10:19.069 --> 01:10:23.120
the legitimation strategies of uh different leaders who had

1197
01:10:23.129 --> 01:10:26.270
authoritarian tendencies such as uh so in hybrid regimes,

1198
01:10:26.279 --> 01:10:30.040
Putin uh and uh Chavez but also the leaders,

1199
01:10:30.049 --> 01:10:33.009
the political party in Sela, so completely different regimes.

1200
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:36.890
And uh uh as we discussed before, they all

1201
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:40.049
use democratic arguments, they just use different ones, right?

1202
01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.350
So they, they use very similar legitimation strategies. They

1203
01:10:44.359 --> 01:10:47.770
just uh fill in the content of the strategies

1204
01:10:47.779 --> 01:10:50.529
with the, with the context of their own country

1205
01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.049
basically. So whatever fits to actually give them more,

1206
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.910
more power, but still present them in a positive

1207
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:56.250
light.

1208
01:10:57.129 --> 01:11:02.640
OK. So talking about those legitimation strategies, how is

1209
01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:05.810
political legitimacy established?

1210
01:11:05.819 --> 01:11:15.770
Exactly. Well, again, uh very very contested idea. Um

1211
01:11:16.279 --> 01:11:18.529
AND it depends whom you would ask. So I

1212
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.370
think legal scholars would just say, well, when there

1213
01:11:21.379 --> 01:11:24.290
are laws and laws are being followed, followed, then

1214
01:11:24.299 --> 01:11:29.220
we have legitimacy, right? Um But uh as you

1215
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:32.229
probably already noticed, I am uh someone who is

1216
01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.000
more interested in how citizens make sense of uh

1217
01:11:35.009 --> 01:11:39.990
political reality uh and how they evaluate it. And

1218
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.200
I think in that uh when, when we take

1219
01:11:42.209 --> 01:11:47.169
that perspective, then legitimacy is uh we can only

1220
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.169
talk about perceived legitimacy and legitimacy in a particular

1221
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.419
context. Um So we cannot have one definition of

1222
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:58.870
legitimacy. What we can say is that legitimacy is

1223
01:11:58.879 --> 01:12:01.770
to perceive someone as having the right to take

1224
01:12:01.779 --> 01:12:06.439
decisions for us, right? So authority that can can,

1225
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:12.649
can make decisions for us without the violence. So

1226
01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:17.640
if we add violence to this, then, well, can

1227
01:12:17.649 --> 01:12:19.879
we call it legitimate? Right? If you feel forced,

1228
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.160
if you say, oh, I disagree with this authority

1229
01:12:22.169 --> 01:12:23.870
and the consequence of that is that they put

1230
01:12:23.879 --> 01:12:27.259
me in jail or they decapitate me, well, then

1231
01:12:27.379 --> 01:12:29.500
it doesn't seem very legitimate. So it has to

1232
01:12:29.509 --> 01:12:32.100
be a kind of voluntary transfer of power to

1233
01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:37.500
an authority. And then um there will be factors

1234
01:12:37.509 --> 01:12:41.209
that are more universal that affect it. But the

1235
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.899
specificities of how these factors are being filled in,

1236
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:48.910
let's say will be contextual. Um And this can,

1237
01:12:48.919 --> 01:12:51.229
the context might mean, you know, some social cultural

1238
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.270
norms or uh even, you know, who is in

1239
01:12:54.279 --> 01:12:56.779
the majority, who is in the minority currently in,

1240
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.819
in society whose interests are represented and who's not.

1241
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:05.919
But in general, um building on my research and

1242
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:09.140
the research of that. That was done before, I

1243
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:13.109
would say that legitimacy is established through fairness and

1244
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.450
fairness in terms of distribution of resources. So perceived

1245
01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:20.089
fairness again, right. That's why it will be contextual

1246
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:24.770
uh perceived distribution of resources, uh perceived uh fairness

1247
01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:28.259
of procedures being applied. And here we would by

1248
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:32.549
that, we would mean um applying the same rules

1249
01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:41.689
to uh all citizens, including politicians. Um And in

1250
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:46.089
the end also, of course, uh receiving some personal

1251
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:50.140
benefits from the political system that we have uh

1252
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:52.770
should be there. Because if you never get anything,

1253
01:13:52.779 --> 01:13:55.520
why would you contribute anything to that system? Right.

1254
01:13:55.589 --> 01:13:58.330
So if you feel like, well, I'm, I'm always

1255
01:13:58.339 --> 01:14:01.609
losing, I never get anything. Uh I'm always excluded

1256
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.790
from the policies that are being established. Why would

1257
01:14:03.799 --> 01:14:05.729
I grant legitimacy to these authorities?

1258
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:12.259
And are there different kinds of legitimation strategies?

1259
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:19.549
Yes, for sure. So, um they will differ probably

1260
01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.839
somewhat between the the regimes, right? So authoritarian regimes

1261
01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:27.229
might use different strategies than democracies. Although there is

1262
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.600
also a lot of overlap. But if you think

1263
01:14:29.609 --> 01:14:34.799
about authoritarian regimes, um strategies very often they find

1264
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:39.259
an enemy, right? So an enemy makes uh makes

1265
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.830
the need for everybody to rally around the flag

1266
01:14:41.839 --> 01:14:44.410
and support the leaders. And then we might grant

1267
01:14:44.419 --> 01:14:46.689
more legitimacy to that leader because we feel like

1268
01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.500
they will protect us. And this, this is also

1269
01:14:49.509 --> 01:14:51.470
something, by the way, we would find among this

1270
01:14:51.479 --> 01:14:54.240
hunter gatherer societies that when there is a threat,

1271
01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.830
um there is more power granted to the leader.

1272
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.029
The thing is that they very quickly after the

1273
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.959
conflict is resolved or after, you know, the uh

1274
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:06.830
the battle uh is, is over, they very quickly

1275
01:15:06.839 --> 01:15:09.509
bring the leader down. So he's again kind of

1276
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.419
leveled, uh you know, and he's one of one

1277
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.259
of them rather than above them, which is not

1278
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.330
necessarily how it works in uh in current mass

1279
01:15:18.339 --> 01:15:22.020
societies and mass politics. So that would be one

1280
01:15:22.029 --> 01:15:27.089
legitimation strategy, another legitimation strategy would be um economic

1281
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.890
performance. So emphasizing how good the government or the

1282
01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:33.370
leaders, the leadership is doing in terms of the

1283
01:15:33.379 --> 01:15:37.419
economy, it can be job creation and then unemployment

1284
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:41.370
uh uh limiting uh it can be foreign investment

1285
01:15:41.379 --> 01:15:46.930
uh uh uh that comes into the country. Sorry,

1286
01:15:46.939 --> 01:15:49.520
I'm, I'm a bit lost for words. Uh So

1287
01:15:49.529 --> 01:15:52.560
attracting foreign investment, that would be something that uh

1288
01:15:52.569 --> 01:15:55.680
uh also Asian countries very often use as their

1289
01:15:55.689 --> 01:16:01.319
um legitimation strategies. Uh It could be also in

1290
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:06.950
the end, no fairness of distribution. So as I

1291
01:16:06.959 --> 01:16:10.459
said, I find that citizens perceive it as something

1292
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:13.479
that is very important to grant legitimacy. So when

1293
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:17.509
the government can explain why the resources are being

1294
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.560
uh distributed in a particular way, and they can

1295
01:16:19.569 --> 01:16:21.680
make a good argument that this is a fair

1296
01:16:21.689 --> 01:16:25.830
distribution and it is beneficial for the society. Uh

1297
01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:29.370
THEN that could also be uh a legitimation strategy.

1298
01:16:29.379 --> 01:16:31.490
So not only economic growth but also how the

1299
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.160
resources are being distributed.

1300
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:39.080
You know, I'm very fond of smaller scale societies.

1301
01:16:39.089 --> 01:16:42.589
And it's interesting to know that, uh you've looked

1302
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.839
into some enter gatherers because, uh, uh I really

1303
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:50.520
like reading ethnography and work on smaller scale societies

1304
01:16:50.529 --> 01:16:55.310
because, uh unless the leaders uh are able and

1305
01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:59.520
that's already in uh bigger scale or somewhat bigger

1306
01:16:59.529 --> 01:17:04.020
scale societies, unless they're able to accumulate enough wealth

1307
01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:09.910
and resources and people around to control people in

1308
01:17:09.919 --> 01:17:14.319
smaller scale societies usually do not put up with

1309
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:19.080
nonsense, with abuse of power, with bullies nor anyone

1310
01:17:19.089 --> 01:17:19.560
like that.

1311
01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:23.779
No. Exactly, exactly. That's why no underperform leaders are

1312
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:26.770
very easily removed in this uh in this situation.

1313
01:17:26.779 --> 01:17:30.419
And we don't have such a direct mechanism in

1314
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:33.700
our politics. It takes usually a while and sometimes

1315
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:35.950
it takes so long that it's very difficult to

1316
01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:39.259
remove them again, right. So uh this is the

1317
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:43.709
difference between this direct kind of interactions, political interactions

1318
01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.939
and indirect ones.

1319
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:51.339
So that's about political legitimacy. But then another concept

1320
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:57.020
is political capacity. So what is political capacity and

1321
01:17:57.029 --> 01:18:01.919
does political legitimacy matter for political capacity?

1322
01:18:03.129 --> 01:18:09.279
So political capacity um is the ability to actually

1323
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:15.129
enforce decisions, right? So if you are governing you,

1324
01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.660
well, you would hope that you can actually do

1325
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:20.069
something and if you have the power, you can

1326
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.629
do something with that power and you can achieve

1327
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.990
uh achieve some policy outcomes. So why legitimacy matters

1328
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.990
often is because if you, if you decide that

1329
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.430
this is the law in the country now and

1330
01:18:34.439 --> 01:18:38.439
nobody follows it. This means that this was futile

1331
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:42.040
that actually uh you know, your political capacity is

1332
01:18:42.049 --> 01:18:44.629
non existent because nobody complies with the decisions you

1333
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.450
are taking or the the laws that you are

1334
01:18:46.459 --> 01:18:51.750
trying to implement. Um And uh a funny, funny

1335
01:18:51.759 --> 01:18:54.229
example of that and this is in a functioning

1336
01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.479
democracy, still functioning democracy is that uh we have

1337
01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:01.649
uh a ban on particular fireworks in the Netherlands.

1338
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.729
And this is a state policy so that uh

1339
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.379
there is, you know, the state can take such

1340
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:09.529
a decision, they have the capacity to do so

1341
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.379
it was agreed, it was uh announced uh yet

1342
01:19:15.439 --> 01:19:18.379
nobody or many, many people do not comply with

1343
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:21.229
that decision. So it means that particular decision at

1344
01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.589
least is not being perceived as legitimate, right? Uh

1345
01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.629
So people,

1346
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.620
by, by the way, let me just ask you

1347
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:30.899
was that decision made on the grounds of I

1348
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.180
don't know environmental risks or what?

1349
01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:36.609
Yeah. So there are of course many things that

1350
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.520
can be said that are wrong with uh fireworks.

1351
01:19:39.529 --> 01:19:41.430
But uh one of the things is of course

1352
01:19:41.439 --> 01:19:45.299
this unnecessary stress to, to animals that are that

1353
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:48.180
they are experiencing. The other one is the amount

1354
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:51.799
of accidents that is happening. So on humans, right?

1355
01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:55.879
So uh there is just basically increased capacity of

1356
01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:58.779
the hospitals needed for that period because people are

1357
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.979
losing their eyes and you know, uh are being

1358
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:06.600
harmed by the fireworks. Um And also, um and

1359
01:20:06.609 --> 01:20:08.350
that is a little bit of a of a

1360
01:20:08.359 --> 01:20:11.649
of the culture of the Netherlands and the, the

1361
01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.359
particularity of society here this night of the New

1362
01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:18.649
Year's is uh is the night when a lot

1363
01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.109
of uh loss of conduct are kind of thrown

1364
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.850
out of the window and there is a lot

1365
01:20:23.859 --> 01:20:27.149
of uh fights happening, right? So it also requires

1366
01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.310
additional police capacity to actually put down some riots

1367
01:20:31.319 --> 01:20:35.450
and unnecessary vandalism. And um so in the end,

1368
01:20:35.459 --> 01:20:38.660
there were very many different reasons uh to do

1369
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:42.220
that. Uh And I guess these are good arguments

1370
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:44.959
but you can also have an argument. Well, we

1371
01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:47.390
as the Dutch people, we like to celebrate in

1372
01:20:47.399 --> 01:20:49.700
this way and the government has no right to

1373
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:52.379
tell us that we cannot do so. So on,

1374
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:54.649
on one hand, you know, you have the government

1375
01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.759
issuing a decision. On the other hand, you have

1376
01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.509
the population saying, well, we, yeah, you can issue

1377
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.620
it but we don't recognize it. And this is

1378
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:04.899
exactly when then the political capacity is meaningless, right?

1379
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:10.770
Because you, yeah, without actually the uh legitimacy granted

1380
01:21:10.779 --> 01:21:14.220
to that decision. Uh YEAH, nothing changes.

1381
01:21:14.959 --> 01:21:18.390
Mhm And uh this is the way in which

1382
01:21:18.399 --> 01:21:23.310
governments respond to disasters affect their legitimacy.

1383
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.069
Um I think in the same way as generally,

1384
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.100
uh legitimacy is being generated. So I know that

1385
01:21:32.109 --> 01:21:34.959
you're referring now, to a very specific uh paper

1386
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:37.720
that I have with Florian Van Leeuwen, where we

1387
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:40.979
used an experiment in different countries. Uh If I

1388
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:45.049
remember correctly, five or six different countries um uh

1389
01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:48.250
in which we manipulated the situation of flooding and

1390
01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:50.919
how the government responds to it. And in that

1391
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:55.680
particular experiment, the government could uh either help uh

1392
01:21:55.689 --> 01:21:59.430
fairly to everybody who was affected or they could

1393
01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:02.709
just help some people only, right, where it created

1394
01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.939
disparity in uh in the sense that not all

1395
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:08.160
those who were in need uh were given some

1396
01:22:08.169 --> 01:22:11.310
help. Uh THE government in that scenario could also

1397
01:22:11.319 --> 01:22:15.339
either uh involve citizens in decision making. So kind

1398
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:18.580
of uh survey what is needed and get into

1399
01:22:18.589 --> 01:22:21.149
the discussion with uh the people that were affected

1400
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.490
or just ignore their request to uh to have

1401
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:28.069
this discussion. And then uh what we also manipulated

1402
01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.910
in that particular scenario was whether people got something

1403
01:22:31.919 --> 01:22:36.740
personally or not, right? Because not everybody was actually

1404
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.959
affected. And what you could also manipulate in this

1405
01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.330
scenario is that you either got something or not.

1406
01:22:42.339 --> 01:22:46.200
And then uh um in the end, what we

1407
01:22:46.209 --> 01:22:49.779
find is that the strongest effect on perceived legitimacy.

1408
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:52.339
So whether you, you like this government and you

1409
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:56.859
wanna grant them power was the distributive justice. So

1410
01:22:56.870 --> 01:23:01.479
whether the uh resources were fairly distributed across those

1411
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:04.529
who were in need and uh in that sense,

1412
01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.459
I think it's, yeah, it, it, when we confront

1413
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:09.580
it with you know, reality and we think about

1414
01:23:09.589 --> 01:23:12.740
the ecological validity, validity, it does make sense, right?

1415
01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.180
So, distributive fairness as the main factor, the uh

1416
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:19.319
procedural fairness also matters. This is again a very

1417
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:23.410
contested effect because some uh some studies show that

1418
01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.270
yeah procedure of mm fairness. So whether you follow

1419
01:23:28.279 --> 01:23:32.629
the the same procedures uh in similar situations and

1420
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.109
apply the same rules to uh to different people,

1421
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:40.490
these effects are varying depending on the context. Sometimes

1422
01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:43.000
it seems like, you know, for example, we like

1423
01:23:43.009 --> 01:23:45.509
a referendum as a procedure when we know that

1424
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.729
we win it, right? But that's not really a

1425
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.390
big commitment. Um And there are also other studies

1426
01:23:51.399 --> 01:23:53.529
that show that maybe this procedural fairness is very

1427
01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:56.589
contextual and when it matters, depends on what situation

1428
01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.470
we are um analyzing. But here this engagement of

1429
01:24:00.479 --> 01:24:03.169
citizens. So the scenario in which the citizens were

1430
01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.490
having the right to say, well, we need this

1431
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.939
and this help is uh uh is what is

1432
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:10.649
required now from the government that increased also the

1433
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.750
perceived legitimacy.

1434
01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.799
So now that we've covered legitimacy, let's get into

1435
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:20.549
the hot topic of our conversation today. That is

1436
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.640
the, the European, the European Union. So

1437
01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:28.569
we talked a little bit already about the eu

1438
01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:29.350
as an ex. Uh

1439
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:33.350
Yes, but, but there are some questions here that

1440
01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:38.979
probably many people are interested in seeing uh addressed

1441
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:44.129
and not list perhaps the B and like that.

1442
01:24:44.964 --> 01:24:48.805
So uh but uh getting into that. Uh I

1443
01:24:48.814 --> 01:24:51.705
would like to ask you about another concept that

1444
01:24:51.714 --> 01:24:54.984
then we can apply to the European Union specifically.

1445
01:24:55.435 --> 01:25:00.984
What is regulatory governance and how much of it

1446
01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:03.334
do we have in the European Union?

1447
01:25:04.919 --> 01:25:07.029
So I will try to be short and concise

1448
01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.100
now. Uh We have a lot of it because

1449
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:14.060
regulatory governance is uh basically everything that the European

1450
01:25:14.069 --> 01:25:18.370
Commission is trying to do uh with their uh

1451
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:21.709
with their specialized agencies. And there are many of

1452
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.430
them right, in different sectors of uh uh of

1453
01:25:25.439 --> 01:25:29.250
politics and society. Um So if you think about

1454
01:25:29.259 --> 01:25:33.149
the E MA, the European medicine agency, this is

1455
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.629
regulatory governance. If there is a deci decision or

1456
01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.950
uh uh a regulation issued by such an agency

1457
01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.430
like about vaccines, this is regulatory uh regulatory power

1458
01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:50.959
of the European Union. Uh If you have issues

1459
01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:54.720
decisions about the safety of particular products or the

1460
01:25:54.729 --> 01:25:57.640
safety of particular materials, like, you know, what can

1461
01:25:57.649 --> 01:26:01.529
be in plastic bottles for uh for Children, for

1462
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:05.169
babies feeding. This is regulatory governance of the eu.

1463
01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.919
So there is really a lot of it. Um

1464
01:26:08.049 --> 01:26:12.359
And yeah, I think despite the fact that there

1465
01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:13.859
is a lot of it, we know very little

1466
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:16.160
about it because it's kind of happening in this

1467
01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:18.180
technocratic space of decision making.

1468
01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:19.290
Mhm

1469
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.740
uh

1470
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:23.910
But uh sort of related to that. Um ARE

1471
01:26:23.919 --> 01:26:28.109
there any legitimacy concerns here when it comes to

1472
01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:32.669
the European Union? Is there for example, enough respect

1473
01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.680
for national sovereignty because you hear that argument uh

1474
01:26:37.689 --> 01:26:41.725
as I mentioned, from people who supported Brexit, but

1475
01:26:41.734 --> 01:26:46.484
also sometimes from other political parties in other political

1476
01:26:46.495 --> 01:26:50.404
countries across the European Union that are not very

1477
01:26:50.415 --> 01:26:55.205
fond of remaining in the European Union. So what

1478
01:26:55.214 --> 01:26:56.725
are your thoughts on that?

1479
01:26:57.959 --> 01:27:00.160
Uh I think there are two important things. So

1480
01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:02.899
there is the, the uh the European Union is

1481
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:06.160
of course a complex uh supranational organization, right? So

1482
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:09.120
it doesn't only have the the European Commission which

1483
01:27:09.129 --> 01:27:11.580
is a technocratic body. It also has the European

1484
01:27:11.589 --> 01:27:14.660
Council that includes the governments of all the countries

1485
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:17.220
that are members of the European Union and the

1486
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:20.750
decision making is different. Also the delegation of power

1487
01:27:20.759 --> 01:27:23.759
is different. So the problem of the European Commission

1488
01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:26.700
is that they are not elected, right? These are

1489
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:32.069
experts uh that advise on particular policies or regulations

1490
01:27:32.439 --> 01:27:35.779
and that's where we come back to our definition

1491
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.299
of, you know, what is democracy and what is

1492
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:41.620
the role of uh different elements of democracy? You

1493
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:44.160
clearly do not delegate power through voting to the

1494
01:27:44.169 --> 01:27:48.500
European Commission. So if you think that democratic governance

1495
01:27:48.509 --> 01:27:51.819
can only be achieved through voting and not through

1496
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:56.009
competence, which the European Commission's uh authority is based

1497
01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:59.279
on, then we have a problem of legitimacy. Now,

1498
01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:03.970
the question is, can we delegate authority or legitimacy

1499
01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:07.509
only on the basis of voting or are we

1500
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.120
OK that some decisions and some regulations are established

1501
01:28:11.129 --> 01:28:16.270
by experts. That's basically the, the kind of dilemma

1502
01:28:16.279 --> 01:28:18.850
that we are dealing with. And then um yeah,

1503
01:28:18.859 --> 01:28:21.640
what does it mean for the National sovereignty? So

1504
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:24.600
the European Commission can um can take different decisions

1505
01:28:24.609 --> 01:28:26.750
if it's a decision, it has to be implemented.

1506
01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:33.919
Um But they also issue recommendations um and recommendations

1507
01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:38.879
can be either taken up or rejected, right? Um

1508
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.660
And there is uh another type of decision making

1509
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:43.919
that now skips my mind, but the one that,

1510
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.240
oh, it's a directive, the one that uh specifies

1511
01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:51.080
what is the, the goal, uh but doesn't show

1512
01:28:51.089 --> 01:28:53.290
the path towards achieving that goal, right? So that

1513
01:28:53.299 --> 01:28:55.600
is in the discretion of the, of the states

1514
01:28:55.609 --> 01:29:00.180
themselves. So again, it depends really on, about which

1515
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:02.680
decisions we are talking about how much they might

1516
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:08.790
potentially infringe on the sovereignty or national sovereignty. Now

1517
01:29:08.799 --> 01:29:10.700
again, we can go back to the treaties and

1518
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:13.680
think about, ok, if you join this organization, what

1519
01:29:13.689 --> 01:29:15.700
does that mean for your sovereignty? And this is

1520
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:19.060
all specified in the Treaties of the European Union

1521
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.140
and in particular policy aspects, um such as the

1522
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:26.089
ones that have to do with the common market.

1523
01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:29.500
We agreed that we will have synchronization of rules,

1524
01:29:29.509 --> 01:29:32.799
right? So that our standards are the same and

1525
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.049
that our rules are the same for all the

1526
01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.250
members of the European Union. There are other um

1527
01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:44.490
policy domains that are not affected like that because

1528
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.479
they are not the core policies of the European

1529
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:49.209
Union and here much more discretion is in the

1530
01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.450
hands of the States or actually there is no

1531
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:56.620
uh no European power over these issues, very little

1532
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:59.939
European power, for example, is over foreign policies of

1533
01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:04.279
uh of specific countries, right? So uh you for

1534
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:08.069
sure know that uh even in the times of

1535
01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:14.140
very um pressing security crisis, we are having uh

1536
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:17.209
still a lot of opposition towards creating common European

1537
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:22.029
security uh structures. So we, we have some of

1538
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.509
the beginnings of this policy. But for example, uh

1539
01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.770
for many countries, it is unimaginable to have the

1540
01:30:26.779 --> 01:30:29.959
European army, right? So a lot of these issues

1541
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:32.209
are still really in the hands of the States

1542
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.459
themselves. Um And then there is, of course, also

1543
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:37.919
the compliance. So for example, the European Union can

1544
01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:41.339
say, well, you should not use that particular component

1545
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:44.459
uh in the plastic bottles for babies. And then

1546
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:48.080
still multiple countries in the eu can say, well,

1547
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:51.569
our uh uh so this would be something that

1548
01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.459
the European Commission is issuing us advice our uh

1549
01:30:55.470 --> 01:31:00.250
state or domestic authority that specializes in this states

1550
01:31:00.259 --> 01:31:03.160
otherwise. Um SO we either do it or we

1551
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:05.379
don't do it right. So the eu can say

1552
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:08.799
it's safe and then France can can say, well,

1553
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:11.839
we ban it anyway. And this happens very often.

1554
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:18.009
And so just looking beyond the sort of narratives

1555
01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.959
that we many times hear from particularly political parties

1556
01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:26.819
that want for their countries to leave the European

1557
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:30.310
Union and some of the concerns they express that

1558
01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:34.049
sometimes, I mean, it's, we, we have to take

1559
01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.850
it with a big grain of salt because many

1560
01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:40.779
times they just want to leverage their political power

1561
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:43.080
and so on, they just thinking about their own

1562
01:31:43.089 --> 01:31:46.620
political interests. But uh do we have good enough

1563
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:51.709
data on uh to what extent uh the average

1564
01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:58.669
European Union citizen considers the European Union itself legitimate

1565
01:31:58.919 --> 01:31:59.649
or not,

1566
01:32:00.689 --> 01:32:05.509
this varies a lot across the different countries. So

1567
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.790
I think in general, there is no huge legitimacy

1568
01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:12.830
crisis. Um So even in countries that are maybe

1569
01:32:12.839 --> 01:32:16.390
a little bit more skeptical towards the eu, often

1570
01:32:16.399 --> 01:32:19.089
the citizens are even more skeptical towards their domestic

1571
01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:22.970
governments here. For example, I'm talking about Slovakia, right?

1572
01:32:22.979 --> 01:32:26.799
So the, the question is what, what is the

1573
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:30.350
concerning level of legitimacy and then what, what, what

1574
01:32:30.359 --> 01:32:34.720
should worry us. Um So I think the main

1575
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:38.259
problem of the relation between the citizens and the

1576
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:41.180
eu is that citizens know very little about the

1577
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:44.100
eu. So they know still maybe not a huge

1578
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:45.990
amount, but they know a lot about their domestic

1579
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.270
politics and the eu politics is so far removed

1580
01:32:50.279 --> 01:32:52.229
from them that it is very difficult for an

1581
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.520
average citizen to evaluate uh you know, how good

1582
01:32:55.529 --> 01:32:57.629
or bad it is for them. And therefore these

1583
01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.229
manipulations from, you know, the strategic politicians might be

1584
01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.509
even more effective. Uh When you talk about the

1585
01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.720
European politics because there is even less, we we

1586
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:10.580
have even less tools to check it. Uh So

1587
01:33:10.589 --> 01:33:14.569
nobody is gonna read these regulations that are concerning

1588
01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:20.250
particular um you know, elements of plastic bottles or

1589
01:33:20.399 --> 01:33:23.370
uh who, which citizen is actually going to look

1590
01:33:23.379 --> 01:33:26.729
at uh the reports about the safety of a

1591
01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:30.220
new vaccine that the uh E MA is uh

1592
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:34.209
is issuing. Right? So in Denmark, for example, I

1593
01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:37.500
don't know if you remember this, but when astrazeneca

1594
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.580
was was contested because of some potential side effects,

1595
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:46.229
the eu the European Commission issued a recommendation that

1596
01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.645
it is safe. But already the domestic kind of

1597
01:33:50.654 --> 01:33:54.475
debate steered the citizens also against astrazeneca and it

1598
01:33:54.484 --> 01:33:58.944
was ultimately banned. Although probably uh on a large

1599
01:33:58.955 --> 01:34:01.205
scale, this was the the vaccine that saved the

1600
01:34:01.214 --> 01:34:03.154
most lives because of the state in which it

1601
01:34:03.165 --> 01:34:07.674
was approved and introduced, right? So you see that

1602
01:34:07.685 --> 01:34:10.305
it's very difficult, well, even for experts to know

1603
01:34:10.314 --> 01:34:13.154
what to do, but then imagine an an average

1604
01:34:13.165 --> 01:34:15.154
citizen like where, where do they pick up their

1605
01:34:15.165 --> 01:34:17.895
information from? And how could they know uh what's

1606
01:34:17.904 --> 01:34:19.024
the right thing to do here?

1607
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:23.680
Mhm. Uh WHICH is uh I, I mean, politics,

1608
01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:27.069
of course uh is a very complicated issue also

1609
01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.310
because private citizens have their own lives, their work,

1610
01:34:32.319 --> 01:34:35.109
their private lives and so on. And so it's

1611
01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.669
very hard and demanding for uh individuals to keep

1612
01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.850
up to date, even with their own national politics.

1613
01:34:44.859 --> 01:34:48.669
And everything that's happening and even less so with

1614
01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.430
something that happens at a super national level like

1615
01:34:52.439 --> 01:34:56.879
the European Union and then also probably in schools,

1616
01:34:56.890 --> 01:35:01.270
people also do not learn enough about uh the

1617
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:06.470
the different uh institutions that operate in the European

1618
01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:09.669
Union, the powers they are granted what they are

1619
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.549
able to do or not. So uh I mean,

1620
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:18.069
it's understandable, at least to some extent white people,

1621
01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:23.959
particularly when they are going through some economic political,

1622
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:31.680
social issues would uh feel uh like supporting parties

1623
01:35:31.689 --> 01:35:35.410
that promote narratives against the European Union.

1624
01:35:35.944 --> 01:35:38.984
Yeah, for sure. So this research that we are

1625
01:35:38.995 --> 01:35:41.254
doing and this is with uh Davila Rinco again

1626
01:35:41.265 --> 01:35:44.435
from uh Leon University on agencies, right on, on

1627
01:35:44.444 --> 01:35:48.375
the European Commission's agencies uh even for us just

1628
01:35:48.384 --> 01:35:52.044
to understand this uh these decisions of even one

1629
01:35:52.055 --> 01:35:55.444
agency. And then imagine the entire scope of, of

1630
01:35:55.455 --> 01:35:58.305
different technocratic decisions that are being made. It's just

1631
01:35:58.314 --> 01:36:02.629
very, very complicated. Um So for citizens, it is

1632
01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.490
impossible to get direct information about it. Uh If

1633
01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.609
they are even uh you know, very interested, it

1634
01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.029
will be difficult to process what is being, being

1635
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.890
published. But then again, when we actually do experiments

1636
01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:18.669
and we uh manipulate how decisions are being made.

1637
01:36:18.689 --> 01:36:23.459
And for example, we show uh the citizens that

1638
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:25.870
the agency is taking the decision on the basis

1639
01:36:25.879 --> 01:36:28.229
of this scientific grounds. And we did it with

1640
01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.560
um for example, an issue that citizens could care

1641
01:36:31.569 --> 01:36:35.839
about which is a safety of, uh, of dried

1642
01:36:35.850 --> 01:36:39.490
meat. So when you dry meat, uh, when you

1643
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.200
know what kind of recommendations we have so that

1644
01:36:42.209 --> 01:36:44.299
we can keep it safe and that you don't

1645
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:46.160
get basically food poisoning when you go and eat

1646
01:36:46.169 --> 01:36:49.770
it in a restaurant. So when we show citizens,

1647
01:36:49.779 --> 01:36:52.649
uh, the, you know, the expertise, actually, they are

1648
01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:55.689
very responsive to that and they support this kind

1649
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.029
of decision making, they would approve a decision that

1650
01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.430
is based on merit, right? So then it seems

1651
01:37:01.439 --> 01:37:04.109
like the legitimacy is not being harmed. But there

1652
01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.040
is this one thing that we are missing in,

1653
01:37:06.049 --> 01:37:09.229
in this chain is actually getting that information to

1654
01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.609
citizens, right? That they know that there is uh

1655
01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:16.240
some expert that cares about their well being and

1656
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:20.339
therefore they conduct proper scientific investigation about, you know,

1657
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:23.810
under what conditions shall we store and prepare this

1658
01:37:23.819 --> 01:37:25.540
uh this meat so that when we go out

1659
01:37:25.549 --> 01:37:27.370
to a restaurant or when we do it ourselves,

1660
01:37:27.379 --> 01:37:30.250
we don't get food poisoning and that step is

1661
01:37:30.259 --> 01:37:33.100
missing. So that's, I think the, the trickiest thing

1662
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:35.970
uh for, for the eu to gain legitimacy.

1663
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:39.509
And uh before we move on to the last

1664
01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.490
topic of our conversation today, uh how does the

1665
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:46.890
eu deal with potential public backlash?

1666
01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:52.319
Mm That's again a very, very uh long topic

1667
01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:55.990
actually. Uh BUT maybe, maybe, maybe not, maybe they

1668
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.259
have very limited tools to do. So I think

1669
01:37:58.270 --> 01:38:01.169
that's the uh the first answer that I, I

1670
01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.220
could give you. So when we, when we think

1671
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:07.759
about, mm Well, so what, what would, what would

1672
01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:11.370
be public backlash? So one thing is of course,

1673
01:38:11.379 --> 01:38:13.709
uh what you refer to in terms of Brexit,

1674
01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.689
that you have politicians that manipulate particular information and

1675
01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.660
then steer citizens against the eu. So that's 11

1676
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:25.549
thing uh what's I investigated together? And this is

1677
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.919
actually a project led by Dmitry Toshkov is the

1678
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:32.799
backlash of citizens uh towards the eu punishing their

1679
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:36.160
own country because of violations that the the government

1680
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:39.350
is committing, right? And this is the specific case

1681
01:38:39.359 --> 01:38:41.709
of Poland that we focused on. But you could

1682
01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:45.470
also imagine uh other countries that are violating the

1683
01:38:45.479 --> 01:38:51.490
treaties by uh basically breaking democratic rules, uh which

1684
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.220
happened in not only Poland, of course, we know

1685
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:57.770
uh that this kind of violations happened in Hungary.

1686
01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:01.580
Uh THERE are to some limited extent happening in

1687
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:04.810
Austria and Slovakia. So in multiple countries um in

1688
01:39:04.819 --> 01:39:08.799
the EU, however, the EU or the European Commission

1689
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:11.209
has not been taking a lot of action against

1690
01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:15.140
that. Uh Poland was actually the first case where

1691
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:18.240
the European Commission and also the European Court of

1692
01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:23.640
Justice started issuing decisions but also implementing punishment. So

1693
01:39:24.009 --> 01:39:27.479
uh that was something that uh was unprecedented that

1694
01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:31.250
uh the Polish government was punished with €1 million

1695
01:39:31.259 --> 01:39:37.390
per day uh for installing um an institution that

1696
01:39:37.399 --> 01:39:41.470
was basically sort of censoring the judges in the

1697
01:39:41.479 --> 01:39:44.259
country, right? So it was uh a, a kind

1698
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:48.620
of uh a control uh ins uh yeah, institution

1699
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:50.890
for what kind of decisions judges are making. And

1700
01:39:50.899 --> 01:39:54.910
this is clearly against the independence of uh, of

1701
01:39:54.919 --> 01:39:57.220
judges, which is an element of the Treaties of

1702
01:39:57.229 --> 01:40:00.000
the European Union. You have to comply with, uh,

1703
01:40:00.009 --> 01:40:03.470
with that to be a member. But until this

1704
01:40:03.479 --> 01:40:06.410
kind of violations happened, the eu did not really

1705
01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:10.839
have any tools to respond to such developments. And

1706
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:13.290
now the question is that you're asking, well, how

1707
01:40:13.299 --> 01:40:16.569
do citizens then respond to that? Right. Uh So

1708
01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:19.250
if the EU is punishing their own country with

1709
01:40:19.259 --> 01:40:25.580
here, actually very substantial financial punishments um by implementing

1710
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:29.009
infringement procedure, then what what do citizens make of

1711
01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:32.649
it? Well, again, the problem of the EU is

1712
01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.930
that citizens mostly don't know. So this was one

1713
01:40:34.939 --> 01:40:37.850
of our main findings that citizens had no idea

1714
01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.529
that this was the, the sum that the EU

1715
01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:45.250
was imposing on, on the government. There was of

1716
01:40:45.259 --> 01:40:48.330
course, later, also the discussion of the blocking of

1717
01:40:48.339 --> 01:40:51.419
particular funds uh for Poland. But this was the,

1718
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:54.049
the first uh infringement procedure that, that had this

1719
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:58.569
€1 million per day punishment. Um And what we

1720
01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.370
found out is that there is very little that

1721
01:41:00.379 --> 01:41:04.330
you can do to actually convince citizens uh that

1722
01:41:04.339 --> 01:41:06.709
this punishment is either right or wrong. So they

1723
01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.970
kind of already predetermined their idea about it on

1724
01:41:10.979 --> 01:41:14.759
the basis of their political attachment. And uh so

1725
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:17.819
the political identity, you know, whether you are in

1726
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:21.479
general pro European or anti European, this already uh

1727
01:41:21.490 --> 01:41:25.490
accounts for most of the decision making in terms

1728
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.950
of, do you support such a uh such a

1729
01:41:27.959 --> 01:41:31.759
punishment or not the only thing that we found

1730
01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:34.509
in, in our experiment? And again, this is very

1731
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:37.720
new preliminary finding and it needs to be replicated

1732
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:39.740
and we need to study it in more context.

1733
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:43.040
But perhaps there is some truth to it is

1734
01:41:43.049 --> 01:41:47.399
that um and basically manipulating the social norm, so

1735
01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:52.490
the norm prevalence increases support for uh for punishing

1736
01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.049
these violations of the rule of law, right? Because

1737
01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.129
that was uh this court's problem was the violation

1738
01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.459
of the rule of law. And then if citizens

1739
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:05.399
were presented with the information, factual information that most

1740
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:09.080
citizens in their society are uh supporting the rule

1741
01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:11.319
of law, they think it's important that the judges

1742
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:14.660
are independent, etcetera, etcetera. If you created this feeling

1743
01:42:14.669 --> 01:42:19.419
of majority norm support, then that increased your personal

1744
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:23.040
uh support for uh the punishment that the Eu

1745
01:42:23.049 --> 01:42:25.290
or the European Commission installed on Poland.

1746
01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.959
And by the way, do you think that there

1747
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:32.740
are, there are any uh I wouldn't even say

1748
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:36.660
easy but good solutions to deal with this sort

1749
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:42.279
of uh gap that we see between uh public

1750
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:46.720
knowledge about the eu how its different agencies and

1751
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:51.109
institutions work, its political legitimacy and so on. Uh

1752
01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:57.669
AND basically, I guess support for the eu and

1753
01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.229
its policies and so on.

1754
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:03.830
I wish I knew, I really don't know if

1755
01:43:03.839 --> 01:43:06.169
there are any, any solutions and if they are,

1756
01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.060
they are not simple because we are just also

1757
01:43:09.069 --> 01:43:14.810
dealing with human interests and human limitations, right? So

1758
01:43:14.819 --> 01:43:17.640
how do you get to that stage that people

1759
01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:20.850
are actually interested in politics? So we actually make

1760
01:43:20.859 --> 01:43:23.459
all people interested in politics because another thing that

1761
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:25.859
we find consistently is that those who are really

1762
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:29.169
invested in political game are the most polarized. And

1763
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:32.129
you know, are the the ones that are responsible

1764
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:35.370
for most of the conflict as well. And maybe

1765
01:43:35.379 --> 01:43:39.640
even deterioration of uh political systems. So, you know,

1766
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:41.229
there are, there are different things that we need

1767
01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.270
to consider when we uh we wanna, yeah, think

1768
01:43:44.279 --> 01:43:47.589
about the engagement in general. We believe that engaged

1769
01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.950
citizens are a good thing. And if we believe

1770
01:43:49.959 --> 01:43:52.779
that then there has to be some kind of

1771
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:57.549
easy way of translating this abstract policies into citizens

1772
01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.950
lives. Um So one of the things I observed

1773
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:05.169
when I was doing some research in Belarus, for

1774
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:07.930
example, was that where the presence of the EU

1775
01:44:07.939 --> 01:44:11.390
is completely limited, right? But the EU is still

1776
01:44:11.399 --> 01:44:15.839
engaging uh in Belarus, they had uh at the

1777
01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:18.990
bus stop screens with information, what can the EU

1778
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.790
do for you? Right. So very directly trying to

1779
01:44:21.799 --> 01:44:23.799
speak to the citizen and what, what can they

1780
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:28.540
get uh from, from the eu um So maybe

1781
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:31.020
this is like a hint of what could be

1782
01:44:31.029 --> 01:44:34.359
done in terms of translating this presence of the

1783
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:37.819
eu into citizens lives. And I think one of

1784
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:42.549
the recent findings also and this is maybe relating

1785
01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.950
to Brexit and you know, this this backlash against

1786
01:44:44.959 --> 01:44:47.750
the eu uh in terms of Brexit is that

1787
01:44:48.279 --> 01:44:53.439
um negative campaigning is not always what drives citizens,

1788
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:57.790
but we need more positive uh emotions or positive

1789
01:44:57.799 --> 01:45:04.200
campaigning in politics. Uh So there are some hints

1790
01:45:04.209 --> 01:45:08.259
that the uh brexiters want because they basically said

1791
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:11.939
we will make the NHS work for you, right?

1792
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:14.479
It's sort of like the Belarus. Uh WHAT can

1793
01:45:14.490 --> 01:45:16.419
the EU do for you? And now it is

1794
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:21.299
actually just wasting our resources on uh on the

1795
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:22.830
EU. But what we would do is we are

1796
01:45:22.839 --> 01:45:25.580
going to bring the N NHS to you now

1797
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:26.979
and we are gonna put it at a higher

1798
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:30.120
level. Um And maybe that worked more than the

1799
01:45:30.129 --> 01:45:35.290
negative campaigning. Whereas the campaign of the anti brexiters

1800
01:45:35.299 --> 01:45:39.479
was mostly based on fear of Brexit, right? So

1801
01:45:39.490 --> 01:45:44.080
not what's uh staying in the eu should bring

1802
01:45:44.089 --> 01:45:47.020
to you, but what leaving the eu will take

1803
01:45:47.029 --> 01:45:49.370
away and what is the fear and the chaos,

1804
01:45:49.379 --> 01:45:52.890
all these complex things that citizens also don't understand.

1805
01:45:52.899 --> 01:45:57.720
So, talking about the common market uh workings rather

1806
01:45:57.729 --> 01:46:00.580
than actually OK, tangibly, what does it mean uh

1807
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:02.970
for me and what does it bring to me?

1808
01:46:02.979 --> 01:46:06.270
So, in terms of positive outcomes. So I, I

1809
01:46:06.279 --> 01:46:08.779
don't have research on that and this is more

1810
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:12.339
from, you know, reading, uh, of others work that

1811
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:15.540
these are the things perhaps that could work. Um,

1812
01:46:15.979 --> 01:46:19.790
BUT there is really plenty of, uh, of things

1813
01:46:19.799 --> 01:46:21.450
that we need to learn first to know whether

1814
01:46:21.459 --> 01:46:22.819
this is applicable at all.

1815
01:46:23.129 --> 01:46:26.950
Mhm. So, let's get into the last topic here

1816
01:46:26.959 --> 01:46:29.669
today then. Um, I would like to ask you

1817
01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.939
a little bit about international humanitarian interventions because you've

1818
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:36.069
also done a bit of work on that. And

1819
01:46:36.379 --> 01:46:39.799
uh it's always a relevant topic but perhaps even

1820
01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:45.169
more relevant in the current uh international political context.

1821
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:50.379
So uh this domestic public support matter when it

1822
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:53.120
comes to these kinds of interventions.

1823
01:46:54.549 --> 01:46:57.390
Uh I would like to believe, yes, when we

1824
01:46:57.399 --> 01:47:02.930
talk about democracies, right? So in general, mm democratic

1825
01:47:02.939 --> 01:47:06.649
governments are more constrained by public opinion than authoritarian

1826
01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:10.509
governments. So they should listen to some extent also

1827
01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.209
to what the public thinks uh because of their

1828
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.890
electoral gains and losses that come with it. Um

1829
01:47:17.899 --> 01:47:20.609
So you would think that they pay attention. So

1830
01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.439
it means that uh not normative, whether we should

1831
01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:26.779
intervene or not, that's not something that I'm discussing.

1832
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:30.479
But it means that in principle, um what citizens

1833
01:47:30.490 --> 01:47:34.410
think should be relevant to the government's taking decisions

1834
01:47:34.419 --> 01:47:38.890
including about uh an intervention in a foreign country.

1835
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:43.859
What we found in our studies is that it's

1836
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:48.850
very difficult to actually manipulate the context in which

1837
01:47:48.859 --> 01:47:52.850
citizens would support an intervention or to increase it

1838
01:47:52.859 --> 01:47:56.580
because the general level when there are atrocities happening

1839
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:59.294
and this is in terms of humanitarian kind of

1840
01:47:59.305 --> 01:48:03.214
intervention, right? Not to go and gain resources or

1841
01:48:03.225 --> 01:48:05.375
you know, drill some oil somewhere. It's really about

1842
01:48:05.384 --> 01:48:10.384
when the domestic government is uh persecuting uh killing

1843
01:48:10.395 --> 01:48:15.194
or threatening with genocide, uh their population. And basically,

1844
01:48:15.205 --> 01:48:17.794
there is no other way to protect them than

1845
01:48:17.805 --> 01:48:19.714
if someone else comes in. So these are the

1846
01:48:19.725 --> 01:48:22.560
situations we are talking about. So in general, people

1847
01:48:22.569 --> 01:48:26.069
already make their mind up and uh they are

1848
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.080
quite supportive of that. So if this is the

1849
01:48:29.089 --> 01:48:31.879
the kind of criteria that we set, this is

1850
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:34.770
a humanitarian intervention, this is the goal to protect

1851
01:48:34.779 --> 01:48:38.759
the population from uh from being killed, then then

1852
01:48:38.770 --> 01:48:44.319
people are quite supportive. Um BUT we found um

1853
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:50.770
increases the the chances of an individual to support

1854
01:48:50.779 --> 01:48:54.029
such an intervention uh and how it is being

1855
01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.740
intervened. So whether in a military way or, you

1856
01:48:56.750 --> 01:49:01.930
know, with humanitarian aid depends on uh some personal

1857
01:49:01.939 --> 01:49:07.560
preferences in terms of uh militarism. So how militaristic

1858
01:49:07.569 --> 01:49:10.709
are you? Right. So if you actually think that

1859
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:13.259
the armies could solve problems or you think that

1860
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:17.649
they cannot. Um SO the more militaristic, you are,

1861
01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.729
the more likely you would support an armed intervention.

1862
01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:22.870
If you are less militaristic, then you would support

1863
01:49:22.879 --> 01:49:27.490
more humanitarian action. Chances of success is something that

1864
01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:30.819
people consider as well. But it's very difficult to

1865
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:33.689
operationalize chance of success because what do you mean

1866
01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:38.379
by success? Right. And different scholars try to study,

1867
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:43.500
for example, the numbers of saved people or prevented

1868
01:49:43.509 --> 01:49:50.299
casualties, some sort of losses and gains operationalization. But

1869
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:53.790
it is very difficult to tap into the exact

1870
01:49:53.799 --> 01:49:56.129
effect. So, you know, if we save hundreds of

1871
01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:59.439
people, does it matter more than or do we

1872
01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:01.240
support it more than when we save thousands of

1873
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:03.890
people? Does it matter? What kind of people we

1874
01:50:03.899 --> 01:50:06.180
are going to save? Are they Democrats or non

1875
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:10.509
Democrats? These kind of things have been studied small

1876
01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.370
effects. Um IN general, I think we have similar

1877
01:50:14.379 --> 01:50:18.979
tendencies uh as in other contexts to uh feel

1878
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:21.660
more supportive of people who are more like us.

1879
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:26.060
Um But the effects are very small. And then

1880
01:50:26.069 --> 01:50:29.220
the last thing that we found also is and

1881
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:32.279
this is in a newer study with uh Eamon

1882
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:36.910
Eloy and also Natalia Kalo, we manipulated the legality

1883
01:50:36.919 --> 01:50:39.689
in terms of the UN approval of such an

1884
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:45.979
intervention. And uh we found out that um when

1885
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:48.629
we have three conditions, so in one condition, we

1886
01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.490
have illegal intervention. So the uh uh Un Security

1887
01:50:53.500 --> 01:51:00.729
Council doesn't unanimously improve uh versus neutral. So we

1888
01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:04.649
don't have information about the uh UN approval and

1889
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:09.040
versus then finally, the legality, so unanimous approval, the

1890
01:51:09.049 --> 01:51:13.390
legality actually increases support for such an intervention. The

1891
01:51:13.399 --> 01:51:15.129
thing is that there is no difference between the

1892
01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:18.399
neutral condition and illegal condition which kind of suggest

1893
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:22.370
to us that people know or have this mm

1894
01:51:22.379 --> 01:51:25.029
you know, kind of intuition that most of these

1895
01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.879
interventions would be blocked and would be illegal in

1896
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:31.600
um uh in terms of the UN approval, which

1897
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:35.310
is also true, right? Because uh it's always either

1898
01:51:35.319 --> 01:51:38.410
China or Russia blocking it or the Western countries

1899
01:51:38.419 --> 01:51:41.629
uh blocking an intervention depending on what we are,

1900
01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.180
what intervention we are talking about. So to achieve

1901
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:47.270
actually unanimous decision of the Un Security Council is

1902
01:51:47.279 --> 01:51:51.229
almost impossible nowadays. So the default is actually illegal

1903
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:56.319
uh intervention. But basically signaling again, we have a

1904
01:51:56.330 --> 01:52:01.160
consensus about it increases people's um support for such

1905
01:52:01.169 --> 01:52:01.950
an intervention.

1906
01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.770
So would you like to uh just before we

1907
01:52:05.779 --> 01:52:08.180
go, would you like to tell us about the

1908
01:52:08.189 --> 01:52:11.850
sort of work you're doing? Now? What topics are

1909
01:52:11.859 --> 01:52:14.899
you going to explore in the near future?

1910
01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:20.240
So that's uh very exciting because I'm uh moving

1911
01:52:20.250 --> 01:52:23.959
forward with this analysis of anthropological records uh of

1912
01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:27.160
hunter gatherers to find out when do they grant

1913
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:29.680
power to authorities and when do they constrain it?

1914
01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:32.439
Uh So this is like the the first building

1915
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:35.040
block of them taking it further and testing whether

1916
01:52:35.049 --> 01:52:37.529
the same kind of intuitions are still present in

1917
01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:41.439
our modern minds. So I would like to further

1918
01:52:41.450 --> 01:52:44.020
focus on, you know, which checks and balances we

1919
01:52:44.029 --> 01:52:46.180
find the most intuitive. And then I I am

1920
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:51.419
developing uh some experimental work to test this effects.

1921
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:54.779
Of course, depending also on funding because that's the

1922
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:57.189
main limitation always for us as scholars uh to

1923
01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.220
have someone fund your ideas. But uh that's the

1924
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:02.649
direction that I wanna go into. And I wanna

1925
01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:07.080
focus mostly on this uh intuitive responses to um

1926
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:11.740
violation of uh checks and balances, different checks and

1927
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:16.350
balances, but also the uh intuitive granting of power.

1928
01:53:16.359 --> 01:53:18.189
So when do you want to grant power to

1929
01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.759
authorities? Uh AND I play a little bit with

1930
01:53:20.770 --> 01:53:23.390
the ideas also uh that is in the liter

1931
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:25.759
that are in the literature on leadership, you know,

1932
01:53:25.770 --> 01:53:29.419
to what extent does competence uh matter to what

1933
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:34.399
extent um some other traits uh play a role

1934
01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:38.359
such as warmth. And this trend of studies actually

1935
01:53:38.370 --> 01:53:42.930
uh started also with uh with me being involved

1936
01:53:42.939 --> 01:53:46.959
in a project uh recently in Ukraine. So 11

1937
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:50.629
of the things uh I wanna elaborate on is

1938
01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.779
to know when people grant legitimacy or power to

1939
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:56.209
leaders and when they constrain it. And uh the

1940
01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.470
recent example of such a study is a study

1941
01:53:58.479 --> 01:54:02.589
we conducted with Lasse Austen Henrique Barto, Ovis, Florian,

1942
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.459
Van Leuven and Mark Van Fu uh from the

1943
01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:09.990
Fryers in Amsterdam. Um The study was conducted in

1944
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.479
Ukraine. So in the context of war, and we

1945
01:54:12.490 --> 01:54:15.600
wanted to know whether the war changes the preferences

1946
01:54:15.609 --> 01:54:20.140
for trade, we value in leaders and to our

1947
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:23.479
best knowledge. This is the first study where um

1948
01:54:23.490 --> 01:54:27.339
we actually talked to citizens that were experiencing war

1949
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:30.160
So we have conducted the study in the first

1950
01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:34.029
two weeks uh of the Russian invasion uh on

1951
01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:38.140
Ukraine. Um And what we did is we actually

1952
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:41.339
assigned participants to different conditions. One was just the

1953
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:43.520
situation now. So we asked them to think about

1954
01:54:43.529 --> 01:54:46.330
the situation now and whether uh and what kind

1955
01:54:46.339 --> 01:54:48.060
of traits they would like to see in the

1956
01:54:48.069 --> 01:54:50.629
leader if they needed to elect one now, which

1957
01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:52.870
for them meant in times, in the times of

1958
01:54:52.879 --> 01:54:56.870
war. Uh And in the other condition, participants were

1959
01:54:56.879 --> 01:55:01.270
randomly asked to imagine that uh the peace has

1960
01:55:01.279 --> 01:55:03.189
returned to their country and that they are about

1961
01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:06.600
to elect uh uh uh a new, new leader

1962
01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:08.529
again. And what kind of traits would they like

1963
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.540
to see in them? And what we see is

1964
01:55:10.549 --> 01:55:13.310
that while in the war condition, the preference for

1965
01:55:13.319 --> 01:55:17.500
dominance is higher, once people think about the peaceful

1966
01:55:17.509 --> 01:55:22.649
conditions, so return to normal democratic, peaceful reality, the

1967
01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:26.009
dominance uh trade is being less preferred. So it

1968
01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.799
actually goes back to a lower preference for dominance.

1969
01:55:29.259 --> 01:55:33.049
And still even in the condition of war, uh

1970
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:38.660
citizens of Ukraine preferred the uh warmth and competence

1971
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:41.299
of the leader much more over the dominance. So,

1972
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:43.770
although you see this shift in how much dominance

1973
01:55:43.779 --> 01:55:46.729
we want when we experience war, uh we still

1974
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:49.959
value the other traits more, right? So the competence

1975
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:52.879
and uh and the warmth. Uh SO this is

1976
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:55.009
the the the findings that we have and we

1977
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:57.609
hope that uh soon we will share also the

1978
01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:59.370
results in the in the publication.

1979
01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:03.350
Great. And if people are interested, where can they

1980
01:56:03.359 --> 01:56:05.709

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.560
is also Google scholar. So feel, feel free to

1984
01:56:14.569 --> 01:56:18.439
browse through the publications. Uh I strive to have

1985
01:56:18.450 --> 01:56:22.319
all my publications uh available open access. And uh

1986
01:56:22.330 --> 01:56:24.930
if they are not published and they are uh

1987
01:56:24.939 --> 01:56:27.149
in journals, then they are published at the OS

1988
01:56:27.169 --> 01:56:31.259
F platform. So uh people can just uh freely
