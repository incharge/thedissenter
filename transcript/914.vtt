00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.009
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.840
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs. And

3
00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:09.430
today I'm joined by Doctor Eduardo Fernandez Duque. He

4
00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.649
is Professor of Anthropology at the School of Arts

5
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.359
and Sciences with a secondary appointment at the School

6
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.500
of the Environment at Yale University. He is a

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.114
biological anthropologist with the g real interest in understanding

8
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.825
the evolution and maintenance of social systems. And today

9
00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:29.145
we're focusing mostly on mating systems in private, by

10
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:33.775
parental care, co-operative breathing, natal dispersal and some other

11
00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:37.044
related topics. So, Doctor Fernandez Duque, welcome to the

12
00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:38.724
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.854
Thank you Ricardo. It's a pleasure and the pleasure

14
00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.534
is mine. It's been an impressive program that you've

15
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.369
been developing over the years. So I'm honored to

16
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.729
be joining the, the host of speakers you've had

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.290
in the past. Thank you. Well,

18
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.810
thank you so much for the kind words. And

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.209
so to start off with uh what different kinds

20
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.810
of mating systems do we find across primate species?

21
00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:03.549
Exactly.

22
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.309
So, uh before I answer specifically that I'd like

23
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.260
to make the distinction, it's gonna help us in

24
00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.610
our conversation later on between social systems and mating

25
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.010
systems. OK. And this is one of those times

26
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.599
when maybe relating it to humans really helps us

27
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.824
get the message across. So we, we always try

28
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.004
to be very careful when we move between monkeys

29
00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:30.444
and humans. But a social system, it's, it's the

30
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:34.025
kind of situation in which individuals of the different

31
00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:37.904
sexes and different ages interact with each other socially,

32
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:42.644
behaviorally, demographically, but without any explicit reference to where

33
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:45.824
they are mating with each other, whether whether they

34
00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.160
are having sex with each other or not. So,

35
00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:52.480
when we talk about a mating system, we're referring

36
00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.239
to in a very general sense who has sex

37
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.580
with whom. And again, further on, I suspect we

38
00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:02.540
will be elaborating a little bit more on the

39
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.760
differences between having sex and actually reproducing with each

40
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:08.820
other. But we can come back, we can come

41
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.319
back to that later. So if we're gonna talk

42
00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:13.768
about who has sex with whom who, who met

43
00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.919
with whom in, in primates, uh you have them

44
00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.539
of all kinds. Uh Most people are very familiar

45
00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:25.619
with those species where you have several adult males

46
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.270
and several adult females and they're all mating with

47
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.639
all of, I mean, with each other, there are

48
00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.729
patterns, of course, sometimes a male will concentrate most

49
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.500
of the mating opportunities and other males may not

50
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.710
be so lucky. Uh BUT usually made most of

51
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.690
the females do have access to mating. So we

52
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.479
talk about those groups as being multi male, multi

53
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.119
female mating systems. We may also refer to them

54
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.199
as polygynous, meaning that one male has access to

55
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.139
many females we have in primates as well. A

56
00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.910
system that's very rare uh in, in most animals

57
00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.600
definitely rare in primates and in humans, which is

58
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.039
a system where a single female may mate with

59
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.779
many males polyandry. And it's in primates, we only

60
00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:18.740
see it in some relatively small primates monkeys of

61
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.270
South America. And then we have another system, which

62
00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.789
is the system where I have focused my research,

63
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.809
which is a system where there is monogamous mating,

64
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.479
meaning that there's only one adult male mating with

65
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.285
one adult female. It is usually the case is

66
00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:39.785
that when that happens, those animals also have some

67
00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:43.664
kind of socially monogamous system. They are just spending

68
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.214
time with each other. So that in a nutshell,

69
00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:49.104
it's a little bit range, big variation that we

70
00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:51.925
see in primates for mating systems.

71
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.679
And what do we know about the factors that

72
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.119
influence mating systems in primates? That is if for

73
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.100
example, in a particular species, we find that polygyny,

74
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.470
polygyny is dominant or monogamy is dominant or any

75
00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.919
other kind of mating system, what are the factors

76
00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.250
that influence that? Exactly.

77
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.460
So it would have been interesting to have my

78
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.809
response to that question, say 57, 10 years ago,

79
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.920
it would have probably been different from what I'm

80
00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.779
gonna say. Now, I am finding myself in the

81
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.579
last many years, immersing more and more into what

82
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:33.029
is known as the causal revolution, uh reading and

83
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.029
teaching and writing about causal inference. I'm trying to

84
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.549
really embrace the uncertainty that comes from the research

85
00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:44.230
we do in primatology. Most of our research is

86
00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:49.369
observational. Therefore, really talking about the factors that influence

87
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.149
sometimes convey to the public an understanding that we

88
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.589
have about the relationship between presumed causes and effects

89
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.890
that we do not have. So having made that

90
00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.670
clarification that we, we be talking about factors that

91
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:09.529
influence what we really mean. What we study primates,

92
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.609
living primates in an ecological setting is what are

93
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.140
some factors that we see happening in a certain

94
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.684
relationship in a certain association with these mating systems

95
00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:25.924
that we observe having made that clarification, which sometimes

96
00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:29.024
of course, we're talking about mating systems in primates.

97
00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:32.415
Maybe it isn't that serious if we do not

98
00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:36.024
get the causal pathway correctly. But it is profoundly

99
00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:41.045
important, the the misunderstanding we have in making causal

100
00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:44.644
influence claims for very, very important social matters that

101
00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:47.154
we're interested in. So what are some of the

102
00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:50.019
factors the the the the typical culprits have been,

103
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.000
of course, all kinds of social and environmental factors

104
00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:57.510
and a very, very general hypothesis that it is

105
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.390
so general that you cannot really test it adequately

106
00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:04.119
is that when you have resources that are distributed

107
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.290
in space in a re relatively homogeneous manner, there

108
00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:11.739
may be a situation that lends itself to a

109
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.570
higher probability of having a monogamous mating system. Why?

110
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.320
Because in mammals and this is very, very important

111
00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:23.279
in mammals. Let's not forget that male and females

112
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.179
have very, very different reproductive biology. Females have a

113
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.970
pregnancy and females lactate males do not. And so

114
00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.470
I think a very reasonable assumption is that that

115
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.149
conditions so much of the social systems and mating

116
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.609
systems of all mammals, primates included. So if the

117
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:47.130
resources say food are evenly distributed in space, the

118
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.589
assumption is that it is likely that females will

119
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.040
distribute in space also evenly because they only need

120
00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:55.779
that similar amounts of food. And it is the

121
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.230
distribution of females in space that may condition that

122
00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:02.670
may influence if if we allow ourselves to speak

123
00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:06.739
in that matter how males may seek females and

124
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.809
how males may organize themselves spatially socially in terms

125
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.040
of mating with females. So we look at the

126
00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:18.619
environment to understand pa patterns of mating systems. Then

127
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.470
of course, you you always have these questions, the,

128
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.739
the egg and the chicken uh challenge because what

129
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.429
comes first is very, very different, difficult to disentangle

130
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.500
in living systems. And so there's a lot of

131
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.029
data suggesting that it is more likely to have

132
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.179
a monogamy in those systems where you can also

133
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.410
recruit, engage the contribution of the male to the

134
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.869
care of the young. Because once you get that,

135
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.929
we're gonna be talking about that assume later on

136
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.839
by parental care or paternal care, then there are

137
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.670
higher benefits to both the male and the female

138
00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:59.339
from sticking together than if the male were just

139
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.579
to mate with one female now and with the

140
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:04.700
second one later, so we look at social factors,

141
00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:07.339
we look at ecological factors, we look at environmental

142
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.220
factors when I'm referring to factors that we can

143
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.799
actually measure in real time in the field.

144
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:19.559
And uh when it comes to monogamy, specifically, there's

145
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:25.519
this distinction between social and genetic monogamy. So what's

146
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.769
the distinction? And why does it matter?

147
00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:33.989
The distinction is again, very, very simple to understand

148
00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:37.840
for us humans, there is a difference between with

149
00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:41.299
whom you have sex and with whom you have

150
00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:46.950
kids, raise them, protect them and contribute resources. So

151
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.020
before the genetic revolution and by that, I mean,

152
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.500
what started occurring now more than 30 years ago

153
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.299
that we are able to obtain samples from the

154
00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:03.609
wild animals. We studied to do genetic analysis before

155
00:09:03.619 --> 00:09:07.140
that we had nothing but looking at who was

156
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.750
mating with whom. So you would have found a

157
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.960
group of all monkeys uh with a lot of

158
00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.719
dedication, maybe you were able to identify who is

159
00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:17.700
the male, who is the female that's very, very

160
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.799
difficult to do in this tax because males and

161
00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:23.690
females look the same. And then you would conclude

162
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.869
that male a only mates with female. A and

163
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.840
so you would call that a social monogamy. You

164
00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:35.130
may also call it monogamous. Ma but the truth

165
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.820
is that we didn't know where that mating really

166
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:44.650
resulted in pregnancies and births. It was through studies

167
00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:49.099
of birds which are primarily monogamous. Most mammals are

168
00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:52.010
not monogamous. Then we started learning about what has

169
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.609
become in the literature called EP CS extra pair

170
00:09:57.619 --> 00:10:03.739
populations. And then we added a fertilizations to that

171
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.789
because an extra peer population was described, as I

172
00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:11.390
see this female who is socially paired to this

173
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.570
male mating with the male outside the peer. That's

174
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.900
an extra peer population. Before genetics, we couldn't still

175
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:24.510
determine where that extra pair of copulation led to

176
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.489
having an infant with genetics. We could and we

177
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.130
started seeing that a huge, huge numbers of bird

178
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.979
species that have been described as socially monogamous were

179
00:10:36.989 --> 00:10:41.440
not genetically monogamous. It wasn't true that a male

180
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.609
and a female were only reproducing with each other.

181
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.590
They were mating with each other, but they were

182
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:52.710
mating also with other males and other females. There

183
00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.559
have been attempts, I mean, people have done the

184
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.599
same kinds of studies with all kinds of primate

185
00:10:56.609 --> 00:10:59.500
species. And that's how we learned that even in

186
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.530
those systems that I was describing before, where you

187
00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:06.190
have many males and many females mating with each

188
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.460
other living with each other, many times you have

189
00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:14.044
sub reproductive skill. What we mean by that is

190
00:11:14.054 --> 00:11:18.094
that it is usually one male who actually sires

191
00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:21.164
most of the young even when the others may

192
00:11:21.174 --> 00:11:24.085
be getting a bite here and there, they are

193
00:11:24.094 --> 00:11:27.094
not really carrying the weight of producing the next

194
00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:33.289
generation of individuals. We have several talks among primates

195
00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:36.789
that are peer living where we see social monogamy

196
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.320
and we have some primates where people have evaluated

197
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.950
generic monogamy. Uh Our project is probably one of

198
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.679
the largest, if not the largest attempt at characterizing

199
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.359
social and generic monogamy in a nonhuman primate. And

200
00:11:53.369 --> 00:11:57.159
much to our surprise, we have found that consistently

201
00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:01.630
for all monkeys in Argentina, it is just that

202
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.099
male and that female who are sharing a space,

203
00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:07.530
who are sharing a home, who are sharing feeding

204
00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:11.299
activities that are only producing infants with each other.

205
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.030
We have never ever in all these years and

206
00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:20.729
now we have evaluated over 100 pairs of putative

207
00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:24.780
infants and fathers never have. We found evidence of

208
00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:30.890
extra pair population always the male to whom we

209
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.289
are, which to whom we assign paternity. It has

210
00:12:34.299 --> 00:12:37.500
always been the male that was in the group

211
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.809
with the female at the time of conception and

212
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.429
pregnancy. I have studied with colleagues in in Ecuador

213
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.619
and other socially monogamous primate, the TD and saki

214
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.309
monkeys with, I mean, we studied this with my

215
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.710
colleague, Tony Di Fiore with Saro Bell Marian Cook.

216
00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:59.229
We have looked at other primates and in those

217
00:12:59.239 --> 00:13:02.719
cases, the evidence is not as unequivocal that you

218
00:13:02.729 --> 00:13:06.909
have genetic monogamy. In fact, our monkeys are today

219
00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.369
one of the very few mammal species where you

220
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.559
just don't find any extra pair paternity. It remains

221
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.380
a puzzle. I am not convinced. I mean, if

222
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.289
you ask me, I bet my money that sooner

223
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.409
or later we're gonna find some data, some, some

224
00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:26.369
evidence suggesting that every so often there is some

225
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.820
extra per attorney but so far none that we

226
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.419
have found.

227
00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:35.239
And so at a certain point there, you mentioned

228
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.239
pair living. So could you tell us a little

229
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.190
bit more about what pair living is? And is

230
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.830
it related in any way to pair bonding or

231
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.039
not

232
00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:48.640
peer living? And, and I, I think I didn't

233
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.650
address before something that's going to be important for

234
00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:54.890
discussing peer living. Why it matters, the distinction between

235
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.710
social and genetic monogamy, it matters because it helps

236
00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:01.739
you understand the pe living. So, I mean, e

237
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.780
evolution depends on, on you passing traits that are

238
00:14:06.789 --> 00:14:10.190
inherited by the future generation, right? That's how traits

239
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.869
become more abundant in the population, how they become

240
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.020
fixed or not. So, really what matters if there's

241
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.840
some biological basis to the tendency to live in

242
00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:25.109
pairs to focus your attention, your mating and reproduction

243
00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:29.380
repression with one single adult be male or female,

244
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.690
it needs to pay off in terms of reproduction

245
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.989
of fitness. That's where the genetic monogamy is important.

246
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.039
What we mean by peer living is now going

247
00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:46.039
back to the social system is that consistently everywhere

248
00:14:46.049 --> 00:14:48.880
people have looked at all monkeys, everywhere people have

249
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.960
looked at titty monkeys from Panama down to Argentina

250
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.640
all the time. We just find one adult male

251
00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.789
and one adult female and they function very cohesively.

252
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.239
They go about their lives very close to each

253
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.229
other. Traveling. I mean, most of the times if

254
00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.520
you go to the forest in Ecuador, in Peru,

255
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.080
in Argentina, you'll find TD monkey adults and old

256
00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:16.840
monkey adults within 3 5 m of each other

257
00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.840
max every so often they may be further away.

258
00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.770
So they're really close to each other. They are

259
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.289
coordinating their activities. One is feeding more most likely

260
00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:29.210
the other one is feeding, one is sleeping, the

261
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:33.349
other is sleeping and very importantly, they're also coordinating

262
00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:37.200
and sharing parental duties. They take care of the

263
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.039
young together. You ask a question about how peer

264
00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:45.830
living and peer bonding relate. They relate a lot.

265
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.409
But here is where I am guilty of sometimes

266
00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:54.409
having discussed peer bonding in all monkeys in the

267
00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:59.659
field without really having the robust evidence for a

268
00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:03.159
pair bond that we may have for some pair

269
00:16:03.219 --> 00:16:07.150
bonded mammals in captivity. This is a good opportunity

270
00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:10.880
for me to discuss how important how enriching it

271
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.929
is to combine what you can learn from studying

272
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.489
animals in the wild and you can what you

273
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.869
can learn from studying animals in captivity. Our monkeys

274
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.070
function in the wild in a way that it

275
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.690
is suggestive of having a very strong pair bond.

276
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.359
When we talk about a pair bond, we are

277
00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:35.890
usually implying some kind of physiological process by which

278
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.280
two individuals, let's talk first about a bond. People

279
00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:42.909
are very familiar with the bond between a mother

280
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:46.440
and an offspring. Not so much, not so much

281
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.280
familiar, the bond exists between a father and an

282
00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:51.239
offspring. What do we mean by that? What do

283
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.000
we mean by the mother offspring bond? We mean

284
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.080
that there's some physiological process by which those two

285
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.940
individuals are emotionally attached. There is some extent of

286
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:07.339
dependency of one on the other and vice versa.

287
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.339
There is usually some anxiety, some stress if that

288
00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:16.618
relationship is terminated, right? The same happens with an

289
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.459
adult male and adult female in many bird species.

290
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.699
And in some mammal species including the titty monkeys

291
00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:27.819
that my colleagues led by by former advisor Bill

292
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.260
Mason Sally Mendoza. And in the last 20 years,

293
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.510
caring males have studied in great detail at the

294
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.829
California Primate Center in the US. So we have

295
00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:42.339
evidence for TV, monkeys that the male and the

296
00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:46.380
female are emotionally connected, they, they seek each other,

297
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.290
they prefer each other and they are stressed when

298
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.199
they cannot count on each other. Do we have

299
00:17:53.209 --> 00:17:55.479
those data? Do we have the kind of detailed

300
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:58.260
data my colleagues have for TD monkeys which I

301
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.900
studied back in the day for the gual monkeys?

302
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.300
No, we don't, but we allow ourselves to make

303
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:10.599
the inference that their behavioral patterns seem to reflect

304
00:18:10.609 --> 00:18:14.680
what is probably a physiologically driven, maintained pair bond.

305
00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:19.729
Uh THE, the, the, the very, very rich but

306
00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:22.410
anecdotal evidence we have of this in the field

307
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.050
is that for 20 years, we have regularly captured

308
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.150
one of the two adults in the pair to

309
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.969
feed them with a radio color. And when that

310
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.089
happens, when you take the male or the female

311
00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:39.609
from the pair, there is quite a fascinating response

312
00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:43.660
by the remaining adult who doesn't run away, stays

313
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.349
near the place where we doing the physical exam

314
00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.689
of his or her partner calling. So that has

315
00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:54.849
been, we never planned this. It so happened, we

316
00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:57.359
need to do it. That has been our little

317
00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:03.030
semi experiment of disrupting the relationship and assessing how

318
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.619
the partner left behind responded. So that's what I

319
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.170
mean by peer living pair bonding. Uh We do

320
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.469
see also behavioral evidence of what seems to be

321
00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:17.859
a very strong attachment of the infants to the

322
00:19:17.869 --> 00:19:21.500
fathers, something that we know as well from TD

323
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.180
monkeys in the field and in captivity.

324
00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:28.530
So I guess that perhaps this will be a

325
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.520
good point to introduce the topic of bi parental

326
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.030
care, which is something that we've already been alluding

327
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.880
to several times in our conversation. So what conditions

328
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.319
favor the evolution of bi parental care

329
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.319
by buying parental care? Of course, we're referring to

330
00:19:47.329 --> 00:19:52.000
a system of care where both parents provide care

331
00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:56.140
very, very frequent, say in birds, very frequent in

332
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.040
fish, but not so frequent in mammals. But remember

333
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.930
birds and fish do not have a pregnancy, do

334
00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:07.484
not have lactation. So, uh mammals like in primates,

335
00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:10.655
like in our monkeys and tty monkeys, the expectation

336
00:20:10.665 --> 00:20:13.525
is that ok, maybe we do not need a

337
00:20:13.535 --> 00:20:16.305
male as long as the female carries on a

338
00:20:16.314 --> 00:20:20.285
successful pregnancy and then nurses the infant. That's all

339
00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:22.824
it takes because in fact, we do see that

340
00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:25.675
in a lot of other mammals where the involvement

341
00:20:25.685 --> 00:20:28.694
of the male is, is trivial or non existent.

342
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.609
But that isn't the case in titty monkeys, our

343
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.800
monkeys and also Khali Rich, which is another group

344
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.050
of primates from South America. In this taxi, this

345
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.550
range of species, the male is actively involved in

346
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.380
providing care to the young. What is it that

347
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.119
the male does when you were asking, let me

348
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.369
describe what we mean by by panel care that

349
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.219
we get into. What is it that may be

350
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.339
favoring the evolution of this in the case of

351
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.670
a Maki anis is quite remarkable when I'm asked,

352
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.329
what is the single, if, if, if I had

353
00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:05.750
to choose one single characteristic of alma anti mais

354
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.609
that makes them unique. I think it is without

355
00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:12.219
any doubts, the commitment of the males to the

356
00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:15.099
kid of the young. I know of no other

357
00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:18.800
mammal on earth where the males are as committed

358
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.180
as fathers, as titty monkeys and owl monkeys. Just

359
00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:26.170
from a few days after birth, the male will

360
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.979
actively seek to engage to interact with a newborn

361
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.280
for the first time in 27 years. Now, 18

362
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.219
months ago, we saw a live birth in the

363
00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.949
forest of Argentina sometime around 11 in the morning.

364
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.979
And for the first time from a wide group

365
00:21:43.989 --> 00:21:47.069
of all monkeys, some assistants were able to see

366
00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:50.410
how the male was right there. It was like

367
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.989
having the male in the, in the same room

368
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.910
in the delivery room. The baby is not yet

369
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.189
completely out of the mom's wound and the father

370
00:22:00.199 --> 00:22:04.369
was there licking sniffing, interacting with mother and the

371
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.709
infant a few days after the infant is born,

372
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.510
the male may also get closer to the female

373
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.089
and between them both, they may transfer the infant

374
00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:17.530
to the male. And I wanna say a week

375
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.660
definitely two weeks after the infant is born, most

376
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.439
of the times the infant will be transported, carried

377
00:22:23.449 --> 00:22:27.510
by the father. So here I'm using male and

378
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.189
father for the Almay of Argentina quick and confidently

379
00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:33.280
call it the father. We know it is the

380
00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.969
genetic father and that relationship goes on and it

381
00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:41.109
goes on through, through the through infancy, through the

382
00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:45.300
juvenile period. Even through s adulthood, we have very

383
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.839
robust data showing that there is from all these

384
00:22:49.849 --> 00:22:54.680
various stages of development. The young prefer to approach

385
00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:57.660
to interact to socialize with the father more than

386
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.800
the mother. In fact, through research done by, by

387
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.579
Doctor Alva Garcia de La Chica from Spain who

388
00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:07.550
who did her phd and a postdoc with the

389
00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:12.099
Almay Project. Her analysis has suggested that there are

390
00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:16.160
bigger consequences to the survival of the young when

391
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.189
the father dies than when the mother dies. So

392
00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:24.359
that's where bipart care is. This very profound, a

393
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.140
commitment of the male to providing care to the

394
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.170
young, the male and the female coordinating you. You

395
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.060
need to be close to each other, right? Because

396
00:23:34.069 --> 00:23:36.939
it is still the female who carries on the

397
00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:41.579
the burden of lactating. And we know that's energetically

398
00:23:41.589 --> 00:23:44.250
costly. So male and female really have to be

399
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.250
peer living and coordinate their activities. If, if mom

400
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.390
were nursing the infant and when she's tired of

401
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.880
it, the male were ranging a mile away, seeking

402
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.609
another female, it wouldn't work. You really need to

403
00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:02.540
have a two, a two person system at home.

404
00:24:02.949 --> 00:24:05.790
And so we think that I go back to

405
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.520
what I was saying before about the chicken and

406
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:12.040
the egg is very, very different to disentangle what

407
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.160
favors what. But when you look another way in

408
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.239
which we can make inferences is to look at

409
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.300
the distribution of these phenotypes of these traits across

410
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.839
the animal kingdom. And consistently, we see that it

411
00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:30.449
is much more likely that you get by parental

412
00:24:30.459 --> 00:24:34.359
care when there is peer living and peer bonding

413
00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:38.479
than the other way around. So evolution is speaking

414
00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:43.569
phylogenetic speaking, there seems to be reasons to suggest

415
00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:49.439
propose that you need to have coordinating peer living,

416
00:24:49.449 --> 00:24:53.750
peer bonding. Why? Because that means proximity. That means

417
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.339
emotional connection. That maybe means faithfulness. Once you have

418
00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:03.229
those conditions settled, then it is much more likely

419
00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:06.660
that the male may be favored if you were

420
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.239
to invest energy on the young. Because by being

421
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.989
close to each other, you reduce the chances of

422
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.890
the extra pair populations. We were discussing before. If

423
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.030
I have been with my partner all along, then

424
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.069
the chances are much higher that I have actually

425
00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:29.949
sired that young. So, evolutionary speaking, it pays off

426
00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:32.319
that I invest energy in a young that I

427
00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:35.949
have sired as opposed to maybe a mating system.

428
00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:38.270
Like we were describing at the beginning where you

429
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.130
have males and females mating with several members of

430
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.000
the other sex. So for mammals that we looked

431
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.569
at when we examined some data in the literature,

432
00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:52.150
this was a study led by my colleague, Marian

433
00:25:52.229 --> 00:25:56.640
Hook where she reviewed the evidence we had for

434
00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:01.410
social monogamy pair bonding and parental care in mammals.

435
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.569
It is usually when you have closely close pairs

436
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:10.369
as opposed to these first pairs that it is

437
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.290
more likely you get by parental care,

438
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.489
right? And so when it comes to things that

439
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.640
we've been talking about, like for example, per leaving

440
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.380
sexual monogamy and bi parental care, do we know

441
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.979
if a sexual selection plays a role in their

442
00:26:29.989 --> 00:26:30.739
evolution?

443
00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:38.359
Yes. So, so keep it I choose between. Yes

444
00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:41.930
and no. Let's go with. Yes. We have decades

445
00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:47.199
and decades of research. On sexual selection, uh and

446
00:26:47.209 --> 00:26:51.560
with a range of taxa, and sometimes we know,

447
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.680
or we allow ourselves to feel that we have

448
00:26:54.689 --> 00:26:58.030
a very solid understanding because it has been shown

449
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.750
in other taxa in other systems where it is

450
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.290
much more likely to really make the manipulations that

451
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.770
allow you to get closer at understanding the connection

452
00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:12.260
between sexually selected traits and a particular mating system.

453
00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:15.619
Uh One of the areas where people have looked,

454
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.119
a lot of potential relationships between factors is body

455
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.849
size dimorphism. Uh We, we as we have a

456
00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:27.459
lot of data indicating that certain traits in ma

457
00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.729
and femurs are sexually selected. It's very interesting that

458
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.520
in pure living primates, we do not have a

459
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.540
lot of sexual dimorphism. And so an argument has

460
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.260
been made and I think again, there's a lot

461
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.270
of data across tax uh suggesting that maybe sexual

462
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.359
dimorphism is related to sexual selection. We do not.

463
00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:52.790
Uh I was saying before how difficult it is,

464
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.589
we cannot really tell males from females without monkeys

465
00:27:56.599 --> 00:27:59.300
and TV monkeys. And this is just to give

466
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.979
you an indication of how complicated it is at

467
00:28:01.989 --> 00:28:04.810
the California prime etcetera where I did my phd

468
00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:09.089
studying T monkeys even today in captivity where you're

469
00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:12.260
looking at the animals say from, from 2 m

470
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.520
away, they tag the males and females with different

471
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.170
tags. It's an exon tag for the males, I

472
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.079
think and a circular one for the females because

473
00:28:22.089 --> 00:28:24.160
you can be standing in front of them and

474
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.520
you cannot tell them apart. So we cannot do

475
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.050
that either with the al monies in the field.

476
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.400
Uh Now going into the genetics of sexual selection,

477
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.209
that is much more challenging. And that's where there's

478
00:28:37.219 --> 00:28:40.780
still so much that we need to do identifying

479
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.510
traits for which we know the genetic basis that

480
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.670
are related. For example, to the tendencies to provide

481
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.170
care in males and females. We we don't really

482
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.880
have that information in Almay or for any primate,

483
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.839
the way in which we approach that is to

484
00:28:58.849 --> 00:29:04.280
look maybe at endocrinological profiles associated with parenting in

485
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:08.030
the K rids that I was mentioning before that

486
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.739
also have peer bonding and they also have paternal

487
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.109
care. My colleagues, I'm thinking of Tony Ziegler or

488
00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:17.540
Jack Snow on. But I'm being unfair to so

489
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.280
many of my colleagues who can work with the

490
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.780
electrics in captivity. They have shown that in these

491
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.520
males that provide a lot of parental care, sometimes

492
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.969
you have some of the same hormones and same

493
00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:31.890
hormonal levels that you see in mothers who are

494
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.319
providing care. So it is a very reasonable assumption

495
00:29:35.329 --> 00:29:38.550
that there has to be some genetics underlying these

496
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.739
hormonal profiles in males and females that are so

497
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.790
similar in situations where the male and the female

498
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.760
are both providing care. But but it's still, I

499
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.699
mean, behavioral genetics as we call it, understand the

500
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:59.589
true genetic basis of complex behaviors like infant care

501
00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:02.670
or peer bonding. Uh We are still very far

502
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.939
from understanding how those things, how those trades get

503
00:30:05.949 --> 00:30:06.699
selected.

504
00:30:07.989 --> 00:30:09.699
So I would like to ask you now a

505
00:30:09.709 --> 00:30:13.599
little bit about co-operative breathing. Uh ON the show,

506
00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:17.469
I've already talked with several anthropologists over the years

507
00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:21.660
uh about the cooper breathing in humans in human

508
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.589
societies. I don't know if you also want to

509
00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:26.339
get a, a little bit into that. But does

510
00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:30.290
it also occur in other primate species?

511
00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:33.810
Yes, it does occur. Uh Let's, we, we can

512
00:30:33.819 --> 00:30:37.270
look back to the first question we were discussing,

513
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.270
which was the range of mating systems we have

514
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.939
in primates. And I, I remember, I, I told

515
00:30:43.949 --> 00:30:46.729
you how, well f first, very basically, what do

516
00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:49.359
we mean by competitive breeding? And, and of course,

517
00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:53.640
among us, biological anthropologist and, and we can qui

518
00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:56.780
like about that, we end up writing reviews about,

519
00:30:56.949 --> 00:31:00.329
but for the purpose of having a fun conversation,

520
00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:03.560
let's decide that the definition is rather straightforward. To

521
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:06.520
me. Cooper breath, you have a number of individuals

522
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:12.189
cooperating in the taking care, raising of the young

523
00:31:12.199 --> 00:31:16.229
in a given group. Uh In some situations, people

524
00:31:16.239 --> 00:31:18.439
would argue that you have cooper breeding where there's

525
00:31:18.449 --> 00:31:21.599
only one female who's the one reproducing and then

526
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.449
males in that group, but also relatives, siblings and

527
00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:30.920
grandparents and grandmothers and grandfathers are all helping. We

528
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.609
do see not it down monkeys and the titty

529
00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:37.989
monkeys. Let's address them first because they leave us

530
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.170
with a very interesting topic that we have not

531
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.949
fully explored. Siblings don't help in our monkeys and

532
00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:49.650
titty monkeys. So you have your peer living species.

533
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.390
Mom, dad, a couple of, there's an infant, there's

534
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.780
a toddler and I have some juveniles and some

535
00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.050
adults and we just have no idea why their

536
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.969
help is not recruited. It doesn't happen in captivity.

537
00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:06.030
It doesn't happen in the wild. It doesn't have

538
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.880
importunities for all monkeys. But in other taxa in

539
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.540
the calitri of South America where mom may have

540
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.939
twins with some frequency and sometimes they may have

541
00:32:16.949 --> 00:32:20.660
twins a couple of times a year. The siblings

542
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.660
help and more than one male may help take

543
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.199
care of those young. So yes, we do have

544
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.540
the kind of situation that has been used to

545
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.689
refer to cooper breeding in humans. It takes a

546
00:32:34.699 --> 00:32:37.780
village, well, maybe not a village for the colored

547
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.280
treats, but definitely more than mom and dad, mom,

548
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:46.449
dad, siblings and some other females and males who

549
00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:50.140
may be related to those young. But for us,

550
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.530
it's something we, we need, we need still to

551
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:57.839
explore. Why don't the siblings in our monkeys and

552
00:32:57.849 --> 00:33:04.469
TV monkeys contribute. Uh Yeah, it's interesting. I imagine

553
00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:06.900
they're probably better off just putting all that energy

554
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.550
into growing healthy and preparing themselves for competing in

555
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.540
securing their own mates in the future.

556
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.400
By the way, when it comes to co-operative breeding,

557
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.109
and now we're talking mostly about other primate species

558
00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:24.229
and not so much humans. Do we know if

559
00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:29.060
there is always necessarily some sort of genetic relatedness

560
00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:35.469
between uh the cooper breathers and the infants or

561
00:33:35.479 --> 00:33:35.849
not?

562
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.790
We don't have a lot of data for that

563
00:33:40.869 --> 00:33:43.680
in the Colored Treaties, but there are some studies

564
00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:48.229
uh reporting that there is relatedness. Uh I have

565
00:33:48.239 --> 00:33:50.800
to admit the, the names of my colleagues who

566
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.520
led those studies are escaping me. So we have

567
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.060
some data for the colored trid in terms of

568
00:33:56.069 --> 00:34:02.130
relatedness now with non humans. What's also what's interesting

569
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:06.069
I think is that if people have asked me

570
00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:08.100
if we were to swap, I mean, if you

571
00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.719
were able to take an infant out monkey and

572
00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:14.478
remove it and bring a substitute, would it change?

573
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.770
My guess is if you did it right away

574
00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.438
from the go I, I'd be surprised if the

575
00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.239
father, if the male doesn't take care of that

576
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.239
young, who is not now, not his desire. Uh

577
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.810
So uh yes, we do have information on relatedness

578
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.399
and it because we know that sometimes it is,

579
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.679
for example, in the colored rich, sometimes it is

580
00:34:35.688 --> 00:34:41.110
brothers who help take care of the twins that

581
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.659
the female has sired. And sometimes we have in

582
00:34:43.668 --> 00:34:46.080
colored rich. Its that more than one male is

583
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.929
really mating with a female. That's why I was

584
00:34:48.938 --> 00:34:51.030
saying before that in those systems, we have what

585
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.360
we call polyandry. The female mating with several males.

586
00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:59.438
So that would be a potential explanation for why

587
00:34:59.648 --> 00:35:02.499
those males may be helping because again, there is

588
00:35:02.509 --> 00:35:05.948
a likelihood that they have sired those young.

589
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.870
Mhm. And do we know exactly what predicts the

590
00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:15.209
evolution of co-operative breeding in particular species?

591
00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:20.800
No, we don't know anything very precisely. That would

592
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.989
be. No. But really, I mean, that, that's the

593
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.770
another conversation we can have one day we need

594
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.629
to tone down. And so we go into the

595
00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:34.909
classroom and teach our entry level students how science

596
00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:39.449
work and how science is self correct itself and

597
00:35:39.459 --> 00:35:41.469
we get it wrong and we try again, but

598
00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:43.739
we seem to forget about those lectures when we

599
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.610
write the papers. So uh no, I don't know.

600
00:35:47.909 --> 00:35:50.149
I would again choosing between. Yes and no, I

601
00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:53.689
would say no, we don't. But so, so your

602
00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:57.840
question was, do we know effectively if cooper breeding

603
00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.729
repeat me basically

604
00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:05.040
what factors predict the evolution of cooper breeding in

605
00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.610
particular species?

606
00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:10.219
Uh No, I think we, it's, it's I I'll

607
00:36:10.229 --> 00:36:12.209
try to answer it the same way that we

608
00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:15.120
explore what we know about the factors that may

609
00:36:15.129 --> 00:36:18.540
influence the evolution of, of peer bonding or monogamy.

610
00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:22.810
Uh And so in humans, it's been argued that

611
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.969
because humans as a species have so many life

612
00:36:26.979 --> 00:36:30.110
history traits that are so profoundly different from life

613
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.199
history traits in other species, it may have been

614
00:36:33.209 --> 00:36:40.320
that by having cooperated breeding, that has completely redesigned

615
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.870
the energetic balance of all the actors involved and

616
00:36:43.879 --> 00:36:46.159
may have allowed humans to have a rate of

617
00:36:46.169 --> 00:36:51.149
reproduction that's unparalleled with other taxa. Uh People have

618
00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:54.649
argued that maybe that's the reason that you also

619
00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:57.919
have in the ked riches which have cooperated breeding

620
00:36:57.929 --> 00:37:01.199
the production of twins. But the production of twins

621
00:37:01.209 --> 00:37:03.590
is such a rare event, at least for all

622
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.649
the primates in the Americas that it is my

623
00:37:05.659 --> 00:37:09.379
understanding that that is still an unresolved issue. So

624
00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:13.919
people have argued have hypothesized that it probably is

625
00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:17.610
related to changes and the pros and cons and

626
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.780
the tradeoffs in life history, traits of humans or

627
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.860
other species with competitive breeding in relationship to those

628
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.520
where there is no competitive breeding. But there have

629
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.860
also been, again, it's making me think about your

630
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.419
initial question on factors promoting monogamy for birds. People

631
00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:40.419
have examined the extent to which it is environmental

632
00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:44.290
unpredictability that may be related to the the evolution

633
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.939
of competitive breeding in birds. Uh So uh many,

634
00:37:48.949 --> 00:37:53.159
many possibilities, many hypothesis. It is possible that for

635
00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:56.409
us to get closer to a more a better

636
00:37:56.419 --> 00:37:59.750
predictive answer would have to narrow down the scope

637
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.949
of tax for which we're developing our hypothetical models.

638
00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:05.949
And instead of trying to understand the evolution of

639
00:38:05.959 --> 00:38:09.239
competitivity in birds, it'd be interesting to see what

640
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:13.070
we learn, trying to go going narrower and deeper.

641
00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:16.270
I it's something that some colleagues are doing, of

642
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:16.750
course.

643
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.189
So I have one more question about co-operative breathing

644
00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:24.679
here before we change topics. So is there any

645
00:38:24.689 --> 00:38:29.310
evidence that cooper breeding might favor in any way

646
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.479
the evolution of enhanced social cognition or larger breeds.

647
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.540
It has been suggested and, and there have been

648
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.820
hypothesis proposed on that. Uh What is interesting? I

649
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.689
am a little bit on, on the side of

650
00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:48.409
this intellectual, very interesting conversation. I have not really

651
00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:51.889
contributed any, any primary research to the to the

652
00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:57.010
debate. Uh My my impression is that the, it

653
00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.010
is not very clear. And if things get much

654
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.860
more complicated when you go outside primates and look

655
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.510
at other tasks to understand if it is really

656
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.540
that competitive breeding uh is related to the kind

657
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:15.370
of development of cognition and brain size that people

658
00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:17.830
have argued for primates comes to my mind. Uh

659
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:22.290
STUDIES by Alex Thornton and and Kathy mccloud who

660
00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.280
have argued that they have all kinds of evidence

661
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.485
from if I remember away from captivity on, on

662
00:39:29.495 --> 00:39:33.094
birds where maybe there is not as much data

663
00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.854
suggesting this. But I think again, it will probably

664
00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:40.284
make more progress in going smaller than bigger. Uh

665
00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:43.735
You cannot expect to have one explanation, explain the

666
00:39:43.745 --> 00:39:46.939
whole diversity of these patterns. But I'm not, I'm

667
00:39:46.949 --> 00:39:50.689
probably not as qualified to comment much on, on,

668
00:39:50.699 --> 00:39:53.739
on social cognition and larger brains. It's, it's quite

669
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:57.330
outside my area of, of interest and ex of

670
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.219
expertise. Definitely. Mhm

671
00:39:59.679 --> 00:40:02.679
So let's get into the last topic of our

672
00:40:02.689 --> 00:40:05.409
conversation today. And I would like to ask you

673
00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:10.250
now about natal dispersal. What is that exactly?

674
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.409
Natal dispersal refers to the process by which an

675
00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:21.239
individual leaves the area where it was born leaves

676
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.159
disperses from the area where it was born. The

677
00:40:24.169 --> 00:40:28.919
natal area. And it is a very important process

678
00:40:28.929 --> 00:40:31.820
in the life of an individual because it's gonna

679
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:37.159
have all kinds of consequences regarding its future. Social

680
00:40:37.169 --> 00:40:41.189
and mating interactions. Take, take it to an extreme

681
00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:44.260
if you're born in a family and you don't

682
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.530
disperse. If you say I'm gonna stay poor, well,

683
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.429
your opportunities for reproduction are gonna be limited most

684
00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:53.419
likely to your father, your mother and your siblings,

685
00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:57.790
and evolutionary speaking, we don't have reasons to believe

686
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.689
that would be an evolutionary stable strategy. So animals

687
00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:05.199
disperse and when they disperse, which of the two

688
00:41:05.209 --> 00:41:08.919
sexes disperses or if both sexes disperses, it has

689
00:41:08.929 --> 00:41:11.629
been a very important area of research in behavioral

690
00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:17.370
ecology for all taxa in monogamous, impair living taxa,

691
00:41:17.379 --> 00:41:23.280
monkeys, primates, mammals, pers, you name them. The expectation

692
00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.870
is that both sexes ought to disperse. And that

693
00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:29.439
was the way it's been always considered in the

694
00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:35.399
literature because drawing from the bird literature for a

695
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:39.219
long time, the assumption was that these pairs were

696
00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:42.760
living together for very prolonged periods, right? They were

697
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.300
pairing for life. And so if the assumption is

698
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.639
that the same male and the same femur are

699
00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:53.070
caring for life in this area, any offspring born

700
00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.070
to them or to the birds. So, so, so

701
00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.120
that they avoid mating with your parents as we

702
00:42:00.129 --> 00:42:03.800
learned in birds and in other tracks including primates,

703
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.300
that pairs are not always long lasting. It is

704
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:11.060
possible that now males and females may not disperse

705
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:15.189
because their parents have been replaced. We have looked

706
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.270
at natal dispersal in great detail. In good part

707
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.810
letter by, by my colleague, Dr Maggie Corley who

708
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.510
did her phd and then continued doing all kinds

709
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.860
of endocrinological behavioral and genetic analysis on natal dispersal.

710
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.830
And in the case of all monkeys like TD,

711
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.459
we know that both sexes disperse, it kind of

712
00:42:36.469 --> 00:42:39.639
makes sense. But what we're learning now, what we're

713
00:42:39.649 --> 00:42:43.219
trying to understand is what are the possible reasons?

714
00:42:43.229 --> 00:42:47.500
What are the possible factors influencing when to disperse?

715
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.729
And this is just work that we are, we're

716
00:42:49.739 --> 00:42:53.270
getting ready to publish, finally being able to look

717
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.429
at the genetics and what Maggie we call Maggie

718
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:58.760
Corley found is that there seems to be a

719
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:03.939
tendency for the animals to disperse sooner or later

720
00:43:03.949 --> 00:43:08.850
in relationship to who of the parents are still

721
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.080
in the group. Something we didn't talk about when

722
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.100
discussing our monkeys and social systems is that the

723
00:43:16.129 --> 00:43:20.500
Almay population in Formosa allowed us to discover something

724
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:24.699
that has not been reported consistently in, in many

725
00:43:24.709 --> 00:43:29.500
mammals, which is the existence of floaters. The animals

726
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.159
who disperse don't get to find a partner right

727
00:43:33.169 --> 00:43:36.500
away, but the range alone is like mom, dad,

728
00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:39.399
I'm leaving. Ok. Go. What are you gonna do.

729
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:41.729
I don't know, I'm gonna move around and see

730
00:43:41.739 --> 00:43:43.889
if I find a partner. And so they move

731
00:43:43.899 --> 00:43:46.489
around and they try to find a partner. But

732
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.469
the problem is that we do not have in

733
00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:52.419
the Almay population in Formosa, anything like bars or

734
00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:55.919
these young adults moving around trying to find partners

735
00:43:56.219 --> 00:43:59.629
can get together and form a new family. So

736
00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:01.810
the solution the young monkeys are playing out is

737
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.030
that my way to find a family is to

738
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.010
really kick out from a home, the same sex

739
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:12.989
adult who is holding control of their home. So

740
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.429
a young adult male will challenge, fight and sometimes

741
00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:21.629
kick out a stable reproducing adult male and a

742
00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:25.899
young female will fight challenge and sometimes kick out

743
00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:28.590
a reproducing female. So now if you are the

744
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.560
young who is pondering, do I disperse or not?

745
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:36.110
You may find yourself that your biological father is

746
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.189
no more. Now you have a stepfather or maybe

747
00:44:39.199 --> 00:44:41.669
you have a stepmother or maybe you have both

748
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:46.520
stepfather and stepmother. And so that changes completely, completely.

749
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.350
So many aspects of how we're examining behavioral patterns,

750
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.570
demographic consequences of all these processes. Because what we're

751
00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.790
learning is that when for an owl monkey, when

752
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.270
the parent of the same sex has been, I'm

753
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.179
sorry, when the parent of the opposite sex has

754
00:45:07.189 --> 00:45:11.389
been replaced, they tend to stay longer. I'm a

755
00:45:11.399 --> 00:45:14.159
female and I'm pondering. Should I leave home or

756
00:45:14.169 --> 00:45:17.489
not? I suddenly I realized that that is not

757
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.840
here anymore. Now, there is a stepfather, a stepfather

758
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.550
that presumably are not related to. So that's the

759
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.330
father may become every productive opportunity I stay longer.

760
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.600
So those are analysis that we, we haven't published

761
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:36.760
yet. We're working on it. But they connect the

762
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.550
process of this pars the timing on this par

763
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.489
with the genetics of group composition and in breeding

764
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.239
avoidance.

765
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:49.510
OK. So let me ask you perhaps one final

766
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.370
question. Then I think that when talking about owl

767
00:45:52.379 --> 00:45:55.290
monkeys and the timing of their natal dispersal, you

768
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.620
focus there mostly on social factors, right? Are there

769
00:45:59.629 --> 00:46:03.830
any other kinds of factors like for example, ecological

770
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.550
factors that might also play a role in explaining

771
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.709
the timing of their dispersal?

772
00:46:10.189 --> 00:46:14.459
Absolutely. And we, we did look into ecological factors

773
00:46:14.469 --> 00:46:18.290
and environmental factors in our forest. It's probably not

774
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.209
the ideal situation to examine those because we work

775
00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:26.709
in a very, very seasonal environment. So sometimes uh

776
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.169
uh when, when things are so seasonal, there are

777
00:46:30.179 --> 00:46:33.219
some aspects of the life history of the animal

778
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:37.010
that match. So you take, take the spring period.

779
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.800
So the spring period is the period when the

780
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.669
babies are born, but it's also the pure when

781
00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.270
food is more abundant. So, so it becomes complicated

782
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.149
to these entangled factors. But what we're finding is

783
00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:51.429
that the environment is not as a strong predictor

784
00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:55.360
of when the animals disperse as maybe some social

785
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.679
factors and all the social factors that we have

786
00:46:57.689 --> 00:47:02.399
been considering it is really relatedness which seems to

787
00:47:02.409 --> 00:47:08.030
be the the more predictive factor than others. But

788
00:47:08.399 --> 00:47:10.739
even when we see this parcel all around the

789
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:14.760
year in Argentina, this parcel goes down, the rate

790
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.649
of this parcel is lower in the winter when

791
00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:21.100
temperatures are lower and there's less abundance of food

792
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.510
because one of the factors that seems reasonable animals

793
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.090
in an evolutionary framework may have played a role

794
00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.300
is that you need to disperse at a time

795
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:37.010
when you can cope with the disadvantages, not being

796
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.409
in a social group. And one of the advantages

797
00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:41.209
of being in a social group can be things

798
00:47:41.219 --> 00:47:44.870
like thermal regulation. The the chaco region of Argentina

799
00:47:44.879 --> 00:47:47.139
gets cold and in the winter, you will see

800
00:47:47.149 --> 00:47:50.179
the animals huddling and sleeping together. Now, if you're

801
00:47:50.189 --> 00:47:53.540
on your own, wandering around at night, during the

802
00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.090
day, in a cold forest, maybe that may be

803
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.479
a disadvantage that doesn't play to you in evolutionary

804
00:48:00.489 --> 00:48:02.610
terms. And the animals may be dispersing at a

805
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.570
time when it's less challenging in terms of thermal

806
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.879
regulation or in terms of finding enough food outside

807
00:48:09.889 --> 00:48:10.620
of your home.

808
00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:16.020
Mhm Great. So Doctor Fernandez Duque, just before we

809
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.419
go, would you like to tell people where they

810
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:21.060
can find you and your work on the internet?

811
00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:25.010
Yes. Uh We have a, we have a website

812
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.929
for the Almony project and if you just type

813
00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:30.489
that you'll come across that and I do have

814
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.489
my own personal website that also provides links to

815
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.899
the project to Fundacion Eco. Uh When I started

816
00:48:38.909 --> 00:48:41.899
my work in the province of Formosa Argentina, we

817
00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:45.500
established Fundacion Eco, which is an NGO that promotes

818
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.560
education in the country. So you can also look

819
00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.489
there and, but I think either my site or

820
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.959
the Almay projects, I should give you plenty of

821
00:48:53.969 --> 00:48:57.830
information for the Almay research. I'm very proud to

822
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.750
say that as of this month. In fact, we

823
00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.520
have just published, I have just published an edited

824
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:07.229
volume that summarizes 30 years of research on all

825
00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:11.070
monkeys from Panama to Argentina. This is a book

826
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.300
published by Springer and it's available. The E book

827
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.939
is free of charge and you can find all

828
00:49:16.949 --> 00:49:21.239
types of research data. 60 colleagues of mine, we

829
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.209
have all put together uh spanning the research on

830
00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:26.590
our monkeys that has been done from Panama down

831
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.199
to Argentina, including also research led by my colleagues

832
00:49:30.209 --> 00:49:32.659
in the US who have been working with our

833
00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:35.300
monkeys for a very, very long time. So Al

834
00:49:35.399 --> 00:49:39.439
Monkey book by Springer is a wonderful resource and

835
00:49:39.449 --> 00:49:42.280
it's available free of charge as an E book.

836
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:44.320
You can find all you need about al monkeys

837
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:44.729
there.

838
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.370
Great. So I'm leaving some links to that in

839
00:49:48.379 --> 00:49:51.979
the description box of this interview. And Doctor Fernandez

840
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.189
