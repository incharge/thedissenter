00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.008
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:05.480
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.868
And today I'm joined by Doctor Eduardo Fernandez Duque.

4
00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.648
He is Professor of Anthropology at the School of Arts

5
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.489
and Sciences with a secondary appointment at the School of

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.239
the Environment at Yale University. He is a biological

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.795
anthropologist with the g real interest in understanding the evolution

8
00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:25.734
and maintenance of social systems. And today we're focusing

9
00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:30.135
mostly on mating systems in private, by parental care

10
00:00:30.144 --> 00:00:34.255
, co-operative breathing, natal dispersal and some other related

11
00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.965
topics. So, Doctor Fernandez Duque, welcome to

12
00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:38.723
the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.853
Thank you Ricardo. It's a pleasure and the pleasure

14
00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.533
is mine. It's been an impressive program that you've

15
00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:47.368
been developing over the years. So I'm honored to

16
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.728
be joining the, the host of speakers you've had

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.569
in the past. Thank you. Well, thank

18
00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.380
you so much for the kind words. And so

19
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.978
to start off with uh what different kinds of mating

20
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.548
systems do we find across primate species? Exactly.

21
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.308
So, uh before I answer specifically that I'd like

22
00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.260
to make the distinction, it's gonna help us in

23
00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:15.290
our conversation later on between social systems and mating systems

24
00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.010
. OK. And this is one of those times

25
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.778
when maybe relating it to humans really helps us get

26
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.823
the message across. So we, we always try

27
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.125
to be very careful when we move between monkeys and

28
00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:30.323
humans. But a social system, it's, it's

29
00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:34.025
the kind of situation in which individuals of the different

30
00:01:34.034 --> 00:01:37.903
sexes and different ages interact with each other socially,

31
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:42.344
behaviorally, demographically, but without any explicit reference to

32
00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:45.644
where they are mating with each other, whether whether

33
00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:48.364
they are having sex with each other or not.

34
00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:51.439
So, when we talk about a mating system,

35
00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:55.519
we're referring to in a very general sense who has

36
00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:57.808
sex with whom. And again, further on,

37
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.439
I suspect we will be elaborating a little bit more

38
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.540
on the differences between having sex and actually reproducing with

39
00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.569
each other. But we can come back, we

40
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.838
can come back to that later. So if we're

41
00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:13.258
gonna talk about who has sex with whom who,

42
00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:15.098
who met with whom in, in primates, uh

43
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.639
you have them of all kinds. Uh Most people

44
00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.550
are very familiar with those species where you have several

45
00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:28.860
adult males and several adult females and they're all mating

46
00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:31.189
with all of, I mean, with each other

47
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.990
, there are patterns, of course, sometimes a

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.750
male will concentrate most of the mating opportunities and other

49
00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.929
males may not be so lucky. Uh but usually

50
00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.830
made most of the females do have access to mating

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.479
. So we talk about those groups as being multi

52
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.409
male, multi female mating systems. We may also

53
00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.379
refer to them as polygynous, meaning that one male

54
00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.830
has access to many females we have in primates as

55
00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:00.588
well. A system that's very rare uh in,

56
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.250
in most animals definitely rare in primates and in humans

57
00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:08.229
, which is a system where a single female may

58
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.308
mate with many males polyandry. And it's in primates

59
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.429
, we only see it in some relatively small primates

60
00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:21.538
monkeys of South America. And then we have another

61
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.069
system, which is the system where I have focused

62
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.069
my research, which is a system where there is

63
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.409
monogamous mating, meaning that there's only one adult male

64
00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.939
mating with one adult female. It is usually the

65
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.875
case is that when that happens, those animals also

66
00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:42.645
have some kind of socially monogamous system. They are

67
00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:45.835
just spending time with each other. So that in

68
00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:46.895
a nutshell, it's a little bit range, big

69
00:03:46.903 --> 00:03:51.925
variation that we see in primates for mating systems.

70
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.520
And what do we know about the factors that influence

71
00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:59.558
mating systems in primates? That is if for example

72
00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.099
, in a particular species, we find that polygyny

73
00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:05.469
, polygyny is dominant or monogamy is dominant or any

74
00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.919
other kind of mating system, what are the factors

75
00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.088
that influence that? Exactly. So it would have

76
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.290
been interesting to have my response to that question,

77
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.629
say 57, 10 years ago, it would have

78
00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.350
probably been different from what I'm gonna say. Now

79
00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:25.939
, I am finding myself in the last many years

80
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.238
, immersing more and more into what is known as

81
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.149
the causal revolution, uh reading and teaching and writing

82
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.238
about causal inference. I'm trying to really embrace the

83
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.149
uncertainty that comes from the research we do in primatology

84
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.238
. Most of our research is observational. Therefore,

85
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.689
really talking about the factors that influence sometimes convey to

86
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.579
the public an understanding that we have about the relationship

87
00:04:55.588 --> 00:05:00.389
between presumed causes and effects that we do not have

88
00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.220
. So having made that clarification that we, we

89
00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.009
be talking about factors that influence what we really mean

90
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:10.988
. What we study primates, living primates in an

91
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.488
ecological setting is what are some factors that we see

92
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.423
happening in a certain relationship in a certain association with

93
00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:24.863
these mating systems that we observe having made that clarification

94
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.524
, which sometimes of course, we're talking about mating

95
00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.944
systems in primates. Maybe it isn't that serious if

96
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:34.113
we do not get the causal pathway correctly. But

97
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:39.875
it is profoundly important, the the misunderstanding we have

98
00:05:39.884 --> 00:05:43.673
in making causal influence claims for very, very important

99
00:05:43.684 --> 00:05:46.814
social matters that we're interested in. So what are

100
00:05:46.824 --> 00:05:48.738
some of the factors the the the the typical culprits

101
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.298
have been, of course, all kinds of social

102
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:56.750
and environmental factors and a very, very general hypothesis

103
00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.439
that it is so general that you cannot really test

104
00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.319
it adequately is that when you have resources that are

105
00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:06.449
distributed in space in a re relatively homogeneous manner,

106
00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.738
there may be a situation that lends itself to a

107
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.569
higher probability of having a monogamous mating system. Why

108
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.540
? Because in mammals and this is very, very

109
00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:21.769
important in mammals. Let's not forget that male and

110
00:06:21.778 --> 00:06:27.879
females have very, very different reproductive biology. Females

111
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.149
have a pregnancy and females lactate males do not.

112
00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:34.338
And so I think a very reasonable assumption is that

113
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.149
that conditions so much of the social systems and mating

114
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.488
systems of all mammals, primates included. So if

115
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.569
the resources say food are evenly distributed in space,

116
00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.588
the assumption is that it is likely that females will

117
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.170
distribute in space also evenly because they only need that

118
00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:56.480
similar amounts of food. And it is the distribution

119
00:06:56.488 --> 00:07:00.709
of females in space that may condition that may influence

120
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.369
if if we allow ourselves to speak in that matter

121
00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:08.410
how males may seek females and how males may organize

122
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.199
themselves spatially socially in terms of mating with females.

123
00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:15.920
So we look at the environment to understand pa patterns

124
00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:18.569
of mating systems. Then of course, you you

125
00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:20.869
always have these questions, the, the egg and

126
00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:25.920
the chicken uh challenge because what comes first is very

127
00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:29.600
, very different, difficult to disentangle in living systems

128
00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.988
. And so there's a lot of data suggesting that

129
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.829
it is more likely to have a monogamy in those

130
00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:41.019
systems where you can also recruit, engage the contribution

131
00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:43.559
of the male to the care of the young.

132
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.238
Because once you get that, we're gonna be talking

133
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.470
about that assume later on by parental care or paternal

134
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.519
care, then there are higher benefits to both the

135
00:07:54.528 --> 00:07:58.108
male and the female from sticking together than if the

136
00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:01.298
male were just to mate with one female now and

137
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:03.869
with the second one later, so we look at

138
00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.369
social factors, we look at ecological factors, we

139
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:09.899
look at environmental factors when I'm referring to factors that

140
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.798
we can actually measure in real time in the field

141
00:08:15.488 --> 00:08:18.199
. And uh when it comes to monogamy, specifically

142
00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:24.028
, there's this distinction between social and genetic monogamy.

143
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.769
So what's the distinction? And why does it matter

144
00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:31.908
? The distinction is again, very, very simple

145
00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:35.830
to understand for us humans, there is a difference

146
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.899
between with whom you have sex and with whom you

147
00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:43.779
have kids, raise them, protect them and contribute

148
00:08:43.788 --> 00:08:50.479
resources. So before the genetic revolution and by that

149
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:52.219
, I mean, what started occurring now more than

150
00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:58.700
30 years ago that we are able to obtain samples

151
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.450
from the wild animals. We studied to do genetic

152
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.960
analysis before that we had nothing but looking at who

153
00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:09.729
was mating with whom. So you would have found

154
00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:11.960
a group of all monkeys uh with a lot of

155
00:09:11.969 --> 00:09:15.719
dedication, maybe you were able to identify who is

156
00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:16.440
the male, who is the female that's very,

157
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.798
very difficult to do in this tax because males and

158
00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:22.690
females look the same. And then you would conclude

159
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.869
that male a only mates with female. A and

160
00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:31.840
so you would call that a social monogamy. You

161
00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:35.129
may also call it monogamous. Ma but the truth

162
00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:39.330
is that we didn't know where that mating really resulted

163
00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.969
in pregnancies and births. It was through studies of

164
00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:48.340
birds which are primarily monogamous. Most mammals are not

165
00:09:48.349 --> 00:09:52.639
monogamous. Then we started learning about what has become

166
00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:58.769
in the literature called EP CS extra pair populations.

167
00:09:58.038 --> 00:10:03.139
And then we added a fertilizations to that because an

168
00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.279
extra peer population was described, as I see this

169
00:10:07.288 --> 00:10:13.940
female who is socially paired to this male mating with

170
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.529
the male outside the peer. That's an extra peer

171
00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:20.908
population. Before genetics, we couldn't still determine where

172
00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:26.519
that extra pair of copulation led to having an infant

173
00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:28.369
with genetics. We could and we started seeing that

174
00:10:28.379 --> 00:10:33.649
a huge, huge numbers of bird species that have

175
00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:39.500
been described as socially monogamous were not genetically monogamous.

176
00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:41.580
It wasn't true that a male and a female were

177
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.590
only reproducing with each other. They were mating with

178
00:10:46.599 --> 00:10:48.918
each other, but they were mating also with other

179
00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:52.639
males and other females. There have been attempts,

180
00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:54.099
I mean, people have done the same kinds of

181
00:10:54.109 --> 00:10:56.619
studies with all kinds of primate species. And that's

182
00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:00.830
how we learned that even in those systems that I

183
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.700
was describing before, where you have many males and

184
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.840
many females mating with each other living with each other

185
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.134
, many times you have sub reproductive skill. What

186
00:11:13.144 --> 00:11:15.465
we mean by that is that it is usually one

187
00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:20.004
male who actually sires most of the young even when

188
00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:22.625
the others may be getting a bite here and there

189
00:11:22.754 --> 00:11:26.663
, they are not really carrying the weight of producing

190
00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:31.330
the next generation of individuals. We have several talks

191
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.019
among primates that are peer living where we see social

192
00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:39.320
monogamy and we have some primates where people have evaluated

193
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.950
generic monogamy. Uh Our project is probably one of

194
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.678
the largest, if not the largest attempt at characterizing

195
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.359
social and generic monogamy in a nonhuman primate. And

196
00:11:52.369 --> 00:11:56.158
much to our surprise, we have found that consistently

197
00:11:56.168 --> 00:12:01.629
for all monkeys in Argentina, it is just that

198
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:05.099
male and that female who are sharing a space,

199
00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:07.529
who are sharing a home, who are sharing feeding

200
00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:11.298
activities that are only producing infants with each other.

201
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.099
We have never ever in all these years and now

202
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:20.629
we have evaluated over 100 pairs of putative infants and

203
00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:24.899
fathers never have. We found evidence of extra pair

204
00:12:24.908 --> 00:12:31.619
population always the male to whom we are, which

205
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:33.950
to whom we assign paternity. It has always been

206
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.700
the male that was in the group with the female

207
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.590
at the time of conception and pregnancy. I have

208
00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:46.330
studied with colleagues in in Ecuador and other socially monogamous

209
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:52.070
primate, the TD and saki monkeys with, I

210
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.029
mean, we studied this with my colleague, Tony

211
00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.200
Di Fiore with Saro Bell Marian Cook. We have

212
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.830
looked at other primates and in those cases, the

213
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.029
evidence is not as unequivocal that you have genetic monogamy

214
00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:07.320
. In fact, our monkeys are today one of

215
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.229
the very few mammal species where you just don't find

216
00:13:11.239 --> 00:13:15.369
any extra pair paternity. It remains a puzzle.

217
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:16.529
I am not convinced. I mean, if you

218
00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:18.379
ask me, I bet my money that sooner or

219
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:22.408
later we're gonna find some data, some, some

220
00:13:22.418 --> 00:13:26.719
evidence suggesting that every so often there is some extra

221
00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:30.418
per attorney but so far none that we have found

222
00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:33.359
. And so at a certain point there, you

223
00:13:33.369 --> 00:13:37.918
mentioned pair living. So could you tell us a

224
00:13:37.928 --> 00:13:39.889
little bit more about what pair living is? And

225
00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:43.830
is it related in any way to pair bonding or

226
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.668
not peer living? And, and I, I

227
00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:50.158
think I didn't address before something that's going to be

228
00:13:50.168 --> 00:13:52.609
important for discussing peer living. Why it matters,

229
00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:56.629
the distinction between social and genetic monogamy, it matters

230
00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:01.129
because it helps you understand the pe living. So

231
00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:05.099
, I mean, e evolution depends on, on

232
00:14:05.109 --> 00:14:09.158
you passing traits that are inherited by the future generation

233
00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:11.418
, right? That's how traits become more abundant in

234
00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:13.190
the population, how they become fixed or not.

235
00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:18.739
So, really what matters if there's some biological basis

236
00:14:18.529 --> 00:14:22.629
to the tendency to live in pairs to focus your

237
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.889
attention, your mating and reproduction repression with one single

238
00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:30.859
adult be male or female, it needs to pay

239
00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:33.899
off in terms of reproduction of fitness. That's where

240
00:14:33.908 --> 00:14:39.219
the genetic monogamy is important. What we mean by

241
00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:41.918
peer living is now going back to the social system

242
00:14:43.219 --> 00:14:46.798
is that consistently everywhere people have looked at all monkeys

243
00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:50.408
, everywhere people have looked at titty monkeys from Panama

244
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.279
down to Argentina all the time. We just find

245
00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:58.369
one adult male and one adult female and they function

246
00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:03.830
very cohesively. They go about their lives very close

247
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.428
to each other. Traveling. I mean, most

248
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.389
of the times if you go to the forest in

249
00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:11.210
Ecuador, in Peru, in Argentina, you'll find

250
00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:15.629
TD monkey adults and old monkey adults within 3 5

251
00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:18.859
m of each other max every so often they may

252
00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:20.759
be further away. So they're really close to each

253
00:15:20.769 --> 00:15:24.320
other. They are coordinating their activities. One is

254
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.168
feeding more most likely the other one is feeding,

255
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.239
one is sleeping, the other is sleeping and very

256
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.729
importantly, they're also coordinating and sharing parental duties.

257
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.538
They take care of the young together. You ask

258
00:15:39.548 --> 00:15:43.928
a question about how peer living and peer bonding relate

259
00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:46.489
. They relate a lot. But here is where

260
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:52.308
I am guilty of sometimes having discussed peer bonding in

261
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.808
all monkeys in the field without really having the robust

262
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.928
evidence for a pair bond that we may have for

263
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:06.139
some pair bonded mammals in captivity. This is a

264
00:16:06.149 --> 00:16:10.739
good opportunity for me to discuss how important how enriching

265
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.928
it is to combine what you can learn from studying

266
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.639
animals in the wild and you can what you can

267
00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:22.178
learn from studying animals in captivity. Our monkeys function

268
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.250
in the wild in a way that it is suggestive

269
00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:27.629
of having a very strong pair bond. When we

270
00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:32.119
talk about a pair bond, we are usually implying

271
00:16:32.219 --> 00:16:37.769
some kind of physiological process by which two individuals,

272
00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.619
let's talk first about a bond. People are very

273
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:44.000
familiar with the bond between a mother and an offspring

274
00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:47.009
. Not so much, not so much familiar,

275
00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:48.899
the bond exists between a father and an offspring.

276
00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:51.379
What do we mean by that? What do we

277
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:55.139
mean by the mother offspring bond? We mean that

278
00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:59.418
there's some physiological process by which those two individuals are

279
00:16:59.428 --> 00:17:03.818
emotionally attached. There is some extent of dependency of

280
00:17:03.828 --> 00:17:07.890
one on the other and vice versa. There is

281
00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:11.630
usually some anxiety, some stress if that relationship is

282
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.019
terminated, right? The same happens with an adult

283
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:21.000
male and adult female in many bird species. And

284
00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:25.098
in some mammal species including the titty monkeys that my

285
00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:29.699
colleagues led by by former advisor Bill Mason Sally Mendoza

286
00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:32.250
. And in the last 20 years, caring males

287
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:37.848
have studied in great detail at the California Primate Center

288
00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:40.709
in the US. So we have evidence for TV

289
00:17:40.719 --> 00:17:42.750
, monkeys that the male and the female are emotionally

290
00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:45.759
connected, they, they seek each other, they

291
00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:51.059
prefer each other and they are stressed when they cannot

292
00:17:51.068 --> 00:17:52.799
count on each other. Do we have those data

293
00:17:52.809 --> 00:17:55.930
? Do we have the kind of detailed data my

294
00:17:55.939 --> 00:17:59.650
colleagues have for TD monkeys which I studied back in

295
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.269
the day for the gual monkeys? No, we

296
00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:06.519
don't, but we allow ourselves to make the inference

297
00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:11.680
that their behavioral patterns seem to reflect what is probably

298
00:18:11.689 --> 00:18:15.170
a physiologically driven, maintained pair bond. Uh the

299
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.130
, the, the, the very, very rich

300
00:18:18.449 --> 00:18:22.410
but anecdotal evidence we have of this in the field

301
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.049
is that for 20 years, we have regularly captured

302
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.299
one of the two adults in the pair to feed

303
00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.709
them with a radio color. And when that happens

304
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:36.318
, when you take the male or the female from

305
00:18:36.328 --> 00:18:38.969
the pair, there is quite a fascinating response by

306
00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:44.160
the remaining adult who doesn't run away, stays near

307
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.130
the place where we doing the physical exam of his

308
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.209
or her partner calling. So that has been,

309
00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:53.848
we never planned this. It so happened, we

310
00:18:53.858 --> 00:18:56.358
need to do it. That has been our little

311
00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:03.130
semi experiment of disrupting the relationship and assessing how the

312
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.900
partner left behind responded. So that's what I mean

313
00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:11.410
by peer living pair bonding. Uh We do see

314
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.059
also behavioral evidence of what seems to be a very

315
00:19:15.068 --> 00:19:18.318
strong attachment of the infants to the fathers, something

316
00:19:18.328 --> 00:19:22.299
that we know as well from TD monkeys in the

317
00:19:22.309 --> 00:19:26.660
field and in captivity. So I guess that perhaps

318
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.259
this will be a good point to introduce the topic

319
00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:33.029
of bi parental care, which is something that we've

320
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.140
already been alluding to several times in our conversation.

321
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.318
So what conditions favor the evolution of bi parental care

322
00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:47.068
by buying parental care? Of course, we're referring

323
00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:52.000
to a system of care where both parents provide care

324
00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:55.390
very, very frequent, say in birds, very

325
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.239
frequent in fish, but not so frequent in mammals

326
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.868
. But remember birds and fish do not have a

327
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.759
pregnancy, do not have lactation. So, uh

328
00:20:04.934 --> 00:20:07.674
mammals like in primates, like in our monkeys and

329
00:20:07.795 --> 00:20:11.634
tty monkeys, the expectation is that ok, maybe

330
00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:15.104
we do not need a male as long as the

331
00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:18.993
female carries on a successful pregnancy and then nurses the

332
00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:21.713
infant. That's all it takes because in fact,

333
00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:23.515
we do see that in a lot of other mammals

334
00:20:23.525 --> 00:20:26.515
where the involvement of the male is, is trivial

335
00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:30.818
or non existent. But that isn't the case in

336
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.459
titty monkeys, our monkeys and also Khali Rich,

337
00:20:33.618 --> 00:20:37.130
which is another group of primates from South America.

338
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.930
In this taxi, this range of species, the

339
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:45.118
male is actively involved in providing care to the young

340
00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:48.459
. What is it that the male does when you

341
00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:51.509
were asking, let me describe what we mean by

342
00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:52.400
by panel care that we get into. What is

343
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.930
it that may be favoring the evolution of this in

344
00:20:56.939 --> 00:21:00.108
the case of a Maki anis is quite remarkable when

345
00:21:00.118 --> 00:21:00.670
I'm asked, what is the single, if,

346
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.789
if, if I had to choose one single characteristic

347
00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:07.500
of alma anti mais that makes them unique. I

348
00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:11.479
think it is without any doubts, the commitment of

349
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:12.588
the males to the kid of the young. I

350
00:21:12.598 --> 00:21:17.809
know of no other mammal on earth where the males

351
00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:19.858
are as committed as fathers, as titty monkeys and

352
00:21:19.868 --> 00:21:23.459
owl monkeys. Just from a few days after birth

353
00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:27.969
, the male will actively seek to engage to interact

354
00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:33.358
with a newborn for the first time in 27 years

355
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.608
. Now, 18 months ago, we saw a

356
00:21:34.618 --> 00:21:40.380
live birth in the forest of Argentina sometime around 11

357
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.299
in the morning. And for the first time from

358
00:21:42.309 --> 00:21:45.430
a wide group of all monkeys, some assistants were

359
00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:48.848
able to see how the male was right there.

360
00:21:48.858 --> 00:21:52.750
It was like having the male in the, in

361
00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:56.239
the same room in the delivery room. The baby

362
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.680
is not yet completely out of the mom's wound and

363
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:03.068
the father was there licking sniffing, interacting with mother

364
00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:07.150
and the infant a few days after the infant is

365
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.900
born, the male may also get closer to the

366
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.410
female and between them both, they may transfer the

367
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.890
infant to the male. And I wanna say a

368
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.049
week definitely two weeks after the infant is born,

369
00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.989
most of the times the infant will be transported,

370
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.289
carried by the father. So here I'm using male

371
00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:30.189
and father for the Almay of Argentina quick and confidently

372
00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:33.279
call it the father. We know it is the

373
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:37.400
genetic father and that relationship goes on and it goes

374
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.108
on through, through the through infancy, through the

375
00:22:41.118 --> 00:22:44.920
juvenile period. Even through s adulthood, we have

376
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.838
very robust data showing that there is from all these

377
00:22:48.848 --> 00:22:53.680
various stages of development. The young prefer to approach

378
00:22:53.689 --> 00:22:56.719
to interact to socialize with the father more than the

379
00:22:56.729 --> 00:23:00.469
mother. In fact, through research done by,

380
00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.578
by Doctor Alva Garcia de La Chica from Spain who

381
00:23:03.588 --> 00:23:07.759
who did her phd and a postdoc with the Almay

382
00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:11.709
Project. Her analysis has suggested that there are bigger

383
00:23:11.719 --> 00:23:15.949
consequences to the survival of the young when the father

384
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:19.608
dies than when the mother dies. So that's where

385
00:23:19.618 --> 00:23:26.059
bipart care is. This very profound, a commitment

386
00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:27.578
of the male to providing care to the young,

387
00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:30.439
the male and the female coordinating you. You need

388
00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:33.059
to be close to each other, right? Because

389
00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:37.309
it is still the female who carries on the the

390
00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:41.358
burden of lactating. And we know that's energetically costly

391
00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:44.608
. So male and female really have to be peer

392
00:23:44.618 --> 00:23:48.250
living and coordinate their activities. If, if mom

393
00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:51.699
were nursing the infant and when she's tired of it

394
00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:55.880
, the male were ranging a mile away, seeking

395
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.519
another female, it wouldn't work. You really need

396
00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:00.750
to have a two, a two person system at

397
00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:04.660
home. And so we think that I go back

398
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.519
to what I was saying before about the chicken and

399
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:11.039
the egg is very, very different to disentangle what

400
00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:15.160
favors what. But when you look another way in

401
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.289
which we can make inferences is to look at the

402
00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:22.828
distribution of these phenotypes of these traits across the animal

403
00:24:22.838 --> 00:24:26.160
kingdom. And consistently, we see that it is

404
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.689
much more likely that you get by parental care when

405
00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:34.229
there is peer living and peer bonding than the other

406
00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:40.269
way around. So evolution is speaking phylogenetic speaking,

407
00:24:40.328 --> 00:24:45.250
there seems to be reasons to suggest propose that you

408
00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.449
need to have coordinating peer living, peer bonding.

409
00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:53.529
Why? Because that means proximity. That means emotional

410
00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:59.338
connection. That maybe means faithfulness. Once you have

411
00:24:59.348 --> 00:25:03.229
those conditions settled, then it is much more likely

412
00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:06.880
that the male may be favored if you were to

413
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.598
invest energy on the young. Because by being close

414
00:25:10.608 --> 00:25:14.108
to each other, you reduce the chances of the

415
00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:17.890
extra pair populations. We were discussing before. If

416
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.029
I have been with my partner all along, then

417
00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:25.098
the chances are much higher that I have actually sired

418
00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:29.449
that young. So, evolutionary speaking, it pays

419
00:25:29.459 --> 00:25:32.318
off that I invest energy in a young that I

420
00:25:32.328 --> 00:25:34.949
have sired as opposed to maybe a mating system.

421
00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:37.489
Like we were describing at the beginning where you have

422
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.618
males and females mating with several members of the other

423
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:47.420
sex. So for mammals that we looked at when

424
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.939
we examined some data in the literature, this was

425
00:25:48.949 --> 00:25:52.259
a study led by my colleague, Marian Hook where

426
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:57.568
she reviewed the evidence we had for social monogamy pair

427
00:25:57.578 --> 00:26:02.739
bonding and parental care in mammals. It is usually

428
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.479
when you have closely close pairs as opposed to these

429
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:11.049
first pairs that it is more likely you get by

430
00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:17.078
parental care, right? And so when it comes

431
00:26:17.088 --> 00:26:19.098
to things that we've been talking about, like for

432
00:26:19.108 --> 00:26:23.299
example, per leaving sexual monogamy and bi parental care

433
00:26:23.578 --> 00:26:27.568
, do we know if a sexual selection plays a

434
00:26:27.578 --> 00:26:37.150
role in their evolution? Yes. So, so

435
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.640
keep it I choose between. Yes and no.

436
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.180
Let's go with. Yes. We have decades and

437
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:47.199
decades of research. On sexual selection, uh and

438
00:26:47.209 --> 00:26:51.559
with a range of taxa, and sometimes we know

439
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.680
, or we allow ourselves to feel that we have

440
00:26:53.689 --> 00:26:57.309
a very solid understanding because it has been shown in

441
00:26:57.318 --> 00:27:00.368
other taxa in other systems where it is much more

442
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.920
likely to really make the manipulations that allow you to

443
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:10.229
get closer at understanding the connection between sexually selected traits

444
00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:14.059
and a particular mating system. Uh One of the

445
00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:17.299
areas where people have looked, a lot of potential

446
00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:22.900
relationships between factors is body size dimorphism. Uh We

447
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.900
, we as we have a lot of data indicating

448
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.959
that certain traits in ma and femurs are sexually selected

449
00:27:30.078 --> 00:27:33.900
. It's very interesting that in pure living primates,

450
00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:37.689
we do not have a lot of sexual dimorphism.

451
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.430
And so an argument has been made and I think

452
00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:44.049
again, there's a lot of data across tax uh

453
00:27:44.078 --> 00:27:48.338
suggesting that maybe sexual dimorphism is related to sexual selection

454
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:51.430
. We do not. Uh I was saying before

455
00:27:51.439 --> 00:27:53.578
how difficult it is, we cannot really tell males

456
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:57.180
from females without monkeys and TV monkeys. And this

457
00:27:57.189 --> 00:28:00.250
is just to give you an indication of how complicated

458
00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:03.920
it is at the California prime etcetera where I did

459
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.858
my phd studying T monkeys even today in captivity where

460
00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:11.818
you're looking at the animals say from, from 2

461
00:28:11.828 --> 00:28:15.059
m away, they tag the males and females with

462
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:18.150
different tags. It's an exon tag for the males

463
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.509
, I think and a circular one for the females

464
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.160
because you can be standing in front of them and

465
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.519
you cannot tell them apart. So we cannot do

466
00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:30.049
that either with the al monies in the field.

467
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.400
Uh Now going into the genetics of sexual selection,

468
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.209
that is much more challenging. And that's where there's

469
00:28:37.219 --> 00:28:41.828
still so much that we need to do identifying traits

470
00:28:41.838 --> 00:28:45.170
for which we know the genetic basis that are related

471
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.400
. For example, to the tendencies to provide care

472
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.500
in males and females. We we don't really have

473
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:56.199
that information in Almay or for any primate, the

474
00:28:56.209 --> 00:28:59.719
way in which we approach that is to look maybe

475
00:28:59.729 --> 00:29:04.219
at endocrinological profiles associated with parenting in the K rids

476
00:29:04.578 --> 00:29:10.140
that I was mentioning before that also have peer bonding

477
00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:12.660
and they also have paternal care. My colleagues,

478
00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.910
I'm thinking of Tony Ziegler or Jack Snow on.

479
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.539
But I'm being unfair to so many of my colleagues

480
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:21.180
who can work with the electrics in captivity. They

481
00:29:21.189 --> 00:29:23.380
have shown that in these males that provide a lot

482
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.449
of parental care, sometimes you have some of the

483
00:29:26.459 --> 00:29:30.140
same hormones and same hormonal levels that you see in

484
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.039
mothers who are providing care. So it is a

485
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:37.088
very reasonable assumption that there has to be some genetics

486
00:29:37.098 --> 00:29:41.588
underlying these hormonal profiles in males and females that are

487
00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:44.789
so similar in situations where the male and the female

488
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:48.709
are both providing care. But but it's still,

489
00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:51.469
I mean, behavioral genetics as we call it,

490
00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.949
understand the true genetic basis of complex behaviors like infant

491
00:29:57.959 --> 00:30:02.368
care or peer bonding. Uh We are still very

492
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.660
far from understanding how those things, how those trades

493
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.410
get selected. So I would like to ask you

494
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.088
now a little bit about co-operative breathing. Uh on

495
00:30:12.098 --> 00:30:15.689
the show, I've already talked with several anthropologists over

496
00:30:15.699 --> 00:30:21.299
the years uh about the cooper breathing in humans in

497
00:30:21.309 --> 00:30:22.469
human societies. I don't know if you also want

498
00:30:22.479 --> 00:30:25.289
to get a, a little bit into that.

499
00:30:25.299 --> 00:30:30.289
But does it also occur in other primate species?

500
00:30:30.848 --> 00:30:33.519
Yes, it does occur. Uh Let's, we

501
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:36.328
, we can look back to the first question we

502
00:30:36.338 --> 00:30:38.750
were discussing, which was the range of mating systems

503
00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:42.239
we have in primates. And I, I remember

504
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.818
, I, I told you how, well f

505
00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:47.039
first, very basically, what do we mean by

506
00:30:47.049 --> 00:30:48.930
competitive breeding? And, and of course, among

507
00:30:48.939 --> 00:30:52.640
us, biological anthropologist and, and we can qui

508
00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:56.779
like about that, we end up writing reviews about

509
00:30:56.949 --> 00:31:00.328
, but for the purpose of having a fun conversation

510
00:31:00.338 --> 00:31:03.469
, let's decide that the definition is rather straightforward.

511
00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:04.660
To me. Cooper breath, you have a number

512
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:11.559
of individuals cooperating in the taking care, raising of

513
00:31:11.568 --> 00:31:15.199
the young in a given group. Uh In some

514
00:31:15.209 --> 00:31:18.108
situations, people would argue that you have cooper breeding

515
00:31:18.118 --> 00:31:21.189
where there's only one female who's the one reproducing and

516
00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:25.239
then males in that group, but also relatives,

517
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.039
siblings and grandparents and grandmothers and grandfathers are all helping

518
00:31:30.608 --> 00:31:33.380
. We do see not it down monkeys and the

519
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.809
titty monkeys. Let's address them first because they leave

520
00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:40.170
us with a very interesting topic that we have not

521
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.949
fully explored. Siblings don't help in our monkeys and

522
00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:48.650
titty monkeys. So you have your peer living species

523
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.509
. Mom, dad, a couple of, there's

524
00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:55.019
an infant, there's a toddler and I have some

525
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:57.529
juveniles and some adults and we just have no idea

526
00:31:57.539 --> 00:32:02.068
why their help is not recruited. It doesn't happen

527
00:32:02.078 --> 00:32:05.509
in captivity. It doesn't happen in the wild.

528
00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:07.630
It doesn't have importunities for all monkeys. But in

529
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.670
other taxa in the calitri of South America where mom

530
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.660
may have twins with some frequency and sometimes they may

531
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:20.039
have twins a couple of times a year. The

532
00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:23.660
siblings help and more than one male may help take

533
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.549
care of those young. So yes, we do

534
00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:30.539
have the kind of situation that has been used to

535
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:34.689
refer to cooper breeding in humans. It takes a

536
00:32:34.699 --> 00:32:37.380
village, well, maybe not a village for the

537
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.640
colored treats, but definitely more than mom and dad

538
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:45.660
, mom, dad, siblings and some other females

539
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.479
and males who may be related to those young.

540
00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:51.348
But for us, it's something we, we need

541
00:32:51.358 --> 00:32:54.709
, we need still to explore. Why don't the

542
00:32:54.719 --> 00:33:00.969
siblings in our monkeys and TV monkeys contribute. Uh

543
00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:05.160
Yeah, it's interesting. I imagine they're probably better

544
00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.759
off just putting all that energy into growing healthy and

545
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:12.868
preparing themselves for competing in securing their own mates in

546
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.039
the future. By the way, when it comes

547
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:19.479
to co-operative breeding, and now we're talking mostly about

548
00:33:19.489 --> 00:33:22.269
other primate species and not so much humans. Do

549
00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:27.078
we know if there is always necessarily some sort of

550
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:35.150
genetic relatedness between uh the cooper breathers and the infants

551
00:33:35.189 --> 00:33:38.789
or not? We don't have a lot of data

552
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:42.559
for that in the Colored Treaties, but there are

553
00:33:42.568 --> 00:33:46.489
some studies uh reporting that there is relatedness. Uh

554
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.920
I have to admit the, the names of my

555
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.130
colleagues who led those studies are escaping me. So

556
00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.900
we have some data for the colored trid in terms

557
00:33:54.910 --> 00:34:00.588
of relatedness now with non humans. What's also what's

558
00:34:00.598 --> 00:34:06.068
interesting I think is that if people have asked me

559
00:34:06.078 --> 00:34:07.019
if we were to swap, I mean, if

560
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.719
you were able to take an infant out monkey and

561
00:34:09.728 --> 00:34:14.478
remove it and bring a substitute, would it change

562
00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:15.769
? My guess is if you did it right away

563
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.438
from the go I, I'd be surprised if the

564
00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.239
father, if the male doesn't take care of that

565
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.628
young, who is not now, not his desire

566
00:34:25.228 --> 00:34:29.938
. Uh So uh yes, we do have information

567
00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:32.168
on relatedness and it because we know that sometimes it

568
00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.769
is, for example, in the colored rich,

569
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:38.780
sometimes it is brothers who help take care of the

570
00:34:38.789 --> 00:34:43.340
twins that the female has sired. And sometimes we

571
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:45.449
have in colored rich. Its that more than one

572
00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.179
male is really mating with a female. That's why

573
00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:50.648
I was saying before that in those systems, we

574
00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.148
have what we call polyandry. The female mating with

575
00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:58.548
several males. So that would be a potential explanation

576
00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:01.177
for why those males may be helping because again,

577
00:35:01.188 --> 00:35:05.947
there is a likelihood that they have sired those young

578
00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.699
. Mhm. And do we know exactly what predicts

579
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:15.688
the evolution of co-operative breeding in particular species? No

580
00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:20.800
, we don't know anything very precisely. That would

581
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.409
be. No. But really, I mean,

582
00:35:22.418 --> 00:35:24.050
that, that's the another conversation we can have one

583
00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:29.070
day we need to tone down. And so we

584
00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:34.030
go into the classroom and teach our entry level students

585
00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:38.409
how science work and how science is self correct itself

586
00:35:38.418 --> 00:35:40.300
and we get it wrong and we try again,

587
00:35:40.309 --> 00:35:43.739
but we seem to forget about those lectures when we

588
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.570
write the papers. So uh no, I don't

589
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.760
know. I would again choosing between. Yes and

590
00:35:49.769 --> 00:35:51.889
no, I would say no, we don't.

591
00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.898
But so, so your question was, do we

592
00:35:53.909 --> 00:36:01.079
know effectively if cooper breeding repeat me basically what factors

593
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:06.610
predict the evolution of cooper breeding in particular species?

594
00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:08.619
Uh No, I think we, it's, it's

595
00:36:08.628 --> 00:36:10.978
I I'll try to answer it the same way that

596
00:36:10.989 --> 00:36:15.119
we explore what we know about the factors that may

597
00:36:15.128 --> 00:36:17.539
influence the evolution of, of peer bonding or monogamy

598
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:22.579
. Uh And so in humans, it's been argued

599
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.969
that because humans as a species have so many life

600
00:36:25.978 --> 00:36:30.409
history traits that are so profoundly different from life history

601
00:36:30.418 --> 00:36:32.619
traits in other species, it may have been that

602
00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:39.500
by having cooperated breeding, that has completely redesigned the

603
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.228
energetic balance of all the actors involved and may have

604
00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:47.619
allowed humans to have a rate of reproduction that's unparalleled

605
00:36:47.628 --> 00:36:52.530
with other taxa. Uh People have argued that maybe

606
00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:54.500
that's the reason that you also have in the ked

607
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:59.349
riches which have cooperated breeding the production of twins.

608
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.809
But the production of twins is such a rare event

609
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.010
, at least for all the primates in the Americas

610
00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:07.219
that it is my understanding that that is still an

611
00:37:07.228 --> 00:37:13.010
unresolved issue. So people have argued have hypothesized that

612
00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:16.030
it probably is related to changes and the pros and

613
00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:19.679
cons and the tradeoffs in life history, traits of

614
00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:23.389
humans or other species with competitive breeding in relationship to

615
00:37:23.398 --> 00:37:28.289
those where there is no competitive breeding. But there

616
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.478
have also been, again, it's making me think

617
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:34.489
about your initial question on factors promoting monogamy for birds

618
00:37:34.989 --> 00:37:38.010
. People have examined the extent to which it is

619
00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:44.289
environmental unpredictability that may be related to the the evolution

620
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.938
of competitive breeding in birds. Uh So uh many

621
00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:52.500
, many possibilities, many hypothesis. It is possible

622
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.030
that for us to get closer to a more a

623
00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:59.750
better predictive answer would have to narrow down the scope

624
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.949
of tax for which we're developing our hypothetical models.

625
00:38:02.958 --> 00:38:06.639
And instead of trying to understand the evolution of competitivity

626
00:38:06.648 --> 00:38:08.369
in birds, it'd be interesting to see what we

627
00:38:08.378 --> 00:38:13.070
learn, trying to go going narrower and deeper.

628
00:38:13.409 --> 00:38:15.269
I it's something that some colleagues are doing, of

629
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.619
course. So I have one more question about co-operative

630
00:38:20.628 --> 00:38:23.188
breathing here before we change topics. So is there

631
00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:29.309
any evidence that cooper breeding might favor in any way

632
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:35.478
the evolution of enhanced social cognition or larger breeds.

633
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:37.539
It has been suggested and, and there have been

634
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:42.728
hypothesis proposed on that. Uh What is interesting?

635
00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:44.449
I am a little bit on, on the side

636
00:38:44.458 --> 00:38:47.070
of this intellectual, very interesting conversation. I have

637
00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:51.570
not really contributed any, any primary research to the

638
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.168
to the debate. Uh My my impression is that

639
00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.250
the, it is not very clear. And if

640
00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.469
things get much more complicated when you go outside primates

641
00:39:04.478 --> 00:39:07.128
and look at other tasks to understand if it is

642
00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:10.539
really that competitive breeding uh is related to the kind

643
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:15.550
of development of cognition and brain size that people have

644
00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:17.869
argued for primates comes to my mind. Uh studies

645
00:39:17.878 --> 00:39:22.570
by Alex Thornton and and Kathy mccloud who have argued

646
00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:27.289
that they have all kinds of evidence from if I

647
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.175
remember away from captivity on, on birds where maybe

648
00:39:30.184 --> 00:39:34.894
there is not as much data suggesting this. But

649
00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:37.934
I think again, it will probably make more progress

650
00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:40.394
in going smaller than bigger. Uh You cannot expect

651
00:39:40.405 --> 00:39:44.894
to have one explanation, explain the whole diversity of

652
00:39:44.905 --> 00:39:46.639
these patterns. But I'm not, I'm probably not

653
00:39:46.648 --> 00:39:51.039
as qualified to comment much on, on, on

654
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.739
social cognition and larger brains. It's, it's quite

655
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:57.329
outside my area of, of interest and ex of

656
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.289
expertise. Definitely. Mhm So let's get into the

657
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.719
last topic of our conversation today. And I would

658
00:40:04.728 --> 00:40:07.360
like to ask you now about natal dispersal. What

659
00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:14.458
is that exactly? Natal dispersal refers to the process

660
00:40:14.469 --> 00:40:19.438
by which an individual leaves the area where it was

661
00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:23.019
born leaves disperses from the area where it was born

662
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:27.750
. The natal area. And it is a very

663
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.590
important process in the life of an individual because it's

664
00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:36.239
gonna have all kinds of consequences regarding its future.

665
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.510
Social and mating interactions. Take, take it to

666
00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:43.958
an extreme if you're born in a family and you

667
00:40:43.969 --> 00:40:45.958
don't disperse. If you say I'm gonna stay poor

668
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.750
, well, your opportunities for reproduction are gonna be

669
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.429
limited most likely to your father, your mother and

670
00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:55.349
your siblings, and evolutionary speaking, we don't have

671
00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.309
reasons to believe that would be an evolutionary stable strategy

672
00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:04.789
. So animals disperse and when they disperse, which

673
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.329
of the two sexes disperses or if both sexes disperses

674
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.099
, it has been a very important area of research

675
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:15.789
in behavioral ecology for all taxa in monogamous, impair

676
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.019
living taxa, monkeys, primates, mammals, pers

677
00:41:20.059 --> 00:41:22.969
, you name them. The expectation is that both

678
00:41:22.978 --> 00:41:27.648
sexes ought to disperse. And that was the way

679
00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:32.610
it's been always considered in the literature because drawing from

680
00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:36.469
the bird literature for a long time, the assumption

681
00:41:36.478 --> 00:41:40.550
was that these pairs were living together for very prolonged

682
00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:43.938
periods, right? They were pairing for life.

683
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.780
And so if the assumption is that the same male

684
00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:50.829
and the same femur are caring for life in this

685
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.530
area, any offspring born to them or to the

686
00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:55.780
birds. So, so, so that they avoid

687
00:41:55.789 --> 00:42:00.949
mating with your parents as we learned in birds and

688
00:42:00.958 --> 00:42:05.550
in other tracks including primates, that pairs are not

689
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:08.599
always long lasting. It is possible that now males

690
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.070
and females may not disperse because their parents have been

691
00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:15.610
replaced. We have looked at natal dispersal in great

692
00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:19.739
detail. In good part letter by, by my

693
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.429
colleague, Dr Maggie Corley who did her phd and

694
00:42:22.438 --> 00:42:28.079
then continued doing all kinds of endocrinological behavioral and genetic

695
00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.769
analysis on natal dispersal. And in the case of

696
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.628
all monkeys like TD, we know that both sexes

697
00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:37.418
disperse, it kind of makes sense. But what

698
00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:39.860
we're learning now, what we're trying to understand is

699
00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:44.079
what are the possible reasons? What are the possible

700
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.679
factors influencing when to disperse? And this is just

701
00:42:47.688 --> 00:42:51.179
work that we are, we're getting ready to publish

702
00:42:51.889 --> 00:42:53.610
, finally being able to look at the genetics and

703
00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:58.219
what Maggie we call Maggie Corley found is that there

704
00:42:58.228 --> 00:43:01.458
seems to be a tendency for the animals to disperse

705
00:43:01.469 --> 00:43:07.219
sooner or later in relationship to who of the parents

706
00:43:07.228 --> 00:43:10.219
are still in the group. Something we didn't talk

707
00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:15.760
about when discussing our monkeys and social systems is that

708
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.500
the Almay population in Formosa allowed us to discover something

709
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.699
that has not been reported consistently in, in many

710
00:43:23.708 --> 00:43:29.079
mammals, which is the existence of floaters. The

711
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.159
animals who disperse don't get to find a partner right

712
00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:36.090
away, but the range alone is like mom,

713
00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:37.728
dad, I'm leaving. Ok. Go. What

714
00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:39.679
are you gonna do. I don't know, I'm

715
00:43:39.688 --> 00:43:43.090
gonna move around and see if I find a partner

716
00:43:43.099 --> 00:43:45.208
. And so they move around and they try to

717
00:43:45.219 --> 00:43:46.219
find a partner. But the problem is that we

718
00:43:46.228 --> 00:43:50.378
do not have in the Almay population in Formosa,

719
00:43:50.438 --> 00:43:53.918
anything like bars or these young adults moving around trying

720
00:43:53.929 --> 00:43:58.429
to find partners can get together and form a new

721
00:43:58.438 --> 00:44:00.260
family. So the solution the young monkeys are playing

722
00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:02.889
out is that my way to find a family is

723
00:44:02.898 --> 00:44:07.659
to really kick out from a home, the same

724
00:44:07.668 --> 00:44:12.409
sex adult who is holding control of their home.

725
00:44:12.519 --> 00:44:15.909
So a young adult male will challenge, fight and

726
00:44:15.918 --> 00:44:21.628
sometimes kick out a stable reproducing adult male and a

727
00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:24.918
young female will fight challenge and sometimes kick out a

728
00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:29.070
reproducing female. So now if you are the young

729
00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:31.559
who is pondering, do I disperse or not?

730
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:36.269
You may find yourself that your biological father is no

731
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.280
more. Now you have a stepfather or maybe you

732
00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:42.469
have a stepmother or maybe you have both stepfather and

733
00:44:42.478 --> 00:44:45.519
stepmother. And so that changes completely, completely.

734
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:50.349
So many aspects of how we're examining behavioral patterns,

735
00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.570
demographic consequences of all these processes. Because what we're

736
00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:58.789
learning is that when for an owl monkey, when

737
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.269
the parent of the same sex has been, I'm

738
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.179
sorry, when the parent of the opposite sex has

739
00:45:07.188 --> 00:45:10.369
been replaced, they tend to stay longer. I'm

740
00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:14.039
a female and I'm pondering. Should I leave home

741
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.250
or not? I suddenly I realized that that is

742
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.949
not here anymore. Now, there is a stepfather

743
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.679
, a stepfather that presumably are not related to.

744
00:45:22.898 --> 00:45:28.418
So that's the father may become every productive opportunity I

745
00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:30.619
stay longer. So those are analysis that we,

746
00:45:30.628 --> 00:45:32.878
we haven't published yet. We're working on it.

747
00:45:34.449 --> 00:45:38.019
But they connect the process of this pars the timing

748
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:44.010
on this par with the genetics of group composition and

749
00:45:44.019 --> 00:45:47.269
in breeding avoidance. OK. So let me ask

750
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.019
you perhaps one final question. Then I think that

751
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.050
when talking about owl monkeys and the timing of their

752
00:45:53.059 --> 00:45:58.619
natal dispersal, you focus there mostly on social factors

753
00:45:58.628 --> 00:46:01.329
, right? Are there any other kinds of factors

754
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.708
like for example, ecological factors that might also play

755
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:08.708
a role in explaining the timing of their dispersal?

756
00:46:09.188 --> 00:46:13.929
Absolutely. And we, we did look into ecological

757
00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:17.010
factors and environmental factors in our forest. It's probably

758
00:46:17.019 --> 00:46:22.208
not the ideal situation to examine those because we work

759
00:46:22.219 --> 00:46:24.668
in a very, very seasonal environment. So sometimes

760
00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:29.478
uh uh when, when things are so seasonal,

761
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.360
there are some aspects of the life history of the

762
00:46:31.369 --> 00:46:35.840
animal that match. So you take, take the

763
00:46:35.849 --> 00:46:37.570
spring period. So the spring period is the period

764
00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:40.159
when the babies are born, but it's also the

765
00:46:40.168 --> 00:46:43.059
pure when food is more abundant. So, so

766
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.228
it becomes complicated to these entangled factors. But what

767
00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:49.889
we're finding is that the environment is not as a

768
00:46:49.898 --> 00:46:53.898
strong predictor of when the animals disperse as maybe some

769
00:46:53.909 --> 00:46:57.679
social factors and all the social factors that we have

770
00:46:57.688 --> 00:47:02.039
been considering it is really relatedness which seems to be

771
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:07.769
the the more predictive factor than others. But even

772
00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.539
when we see this parcel all around the year in

773
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.978
Argentina, this parcel goes down, the rate of

774
00:47:14.989 --> 00:47:17.429
this parcel is lower in the winter when temperatures are

775
00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:22.478
lower and there's less abundance of food because one of

776
00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:27.780
the factors that seems reasonable animals in an evolutionary framework

777
00:47:27.869 --> 00:47:29.878
may have played a role is that you need to

778
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:35.389
disperse at a time when you can cope with the

779
00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:37.148
disadvantages, not being in a social group. And

780
00:47:37.159 --> 00:47:39.610
one of the advantages of being in a social group

781
00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:43.809
can be things like thermal regulation. The the chaco

782
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.628
region of Argentina gets cold and in the winter,

783
00:47:45.639 --> 00:47:49.398
you will see the animals huddling and sleeping together.

784
00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:52.639
Now, if you're on your own, wandering around

785
00:47:52.648 --> 00:47:53.429
at night, during the day, in a cold

786
00:47:53.438 --> 00:47:57.679
forest, maybe that may be a disadvantage that doesn't

787
00:47:57.688 --> 00:48:00.708
play to you in evolutionary terms. And the animals

788
00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:04.688
may be dispersing at a time when it's less challenging

789
00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:07.619
in terms of thermal regulation or in terms of finding

790
00:48:07.628 --> 00:48:13.039
enough food outside of your home. Mhm Great.

791
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.418
So Doctor Fernandez Duque, just before we go,

792
00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:19.019
would you like to tell people where they can find

793
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.699
you and your work on the internet? Yes.

794
00:48:22.708 --> 00:48:24.250
Uh We have a, we have a website for

795
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.429
the Almony project and if you just type that you'll

796
00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:30.378
come across that and I do have my own personal

797
00:48:30.389 --> 00:48:36.708
website that also provides links to the project to Fundacion

798
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.750
Eco. Uh When I started my work in the

799
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.378
province of Formosa Argentina, we established Fundacion Eco,

800
00:48:43.389 --> 00:48:45.929
which is an NGO that promotes education in the country

801
00:48:45.938 --> 00:48:49.949
. So you can also look there and, but

802
00:48:49.958 --> 00:48:52.449
I think either my site or the Almay projects,

803
00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:54.320
I should give you plenty of information for the Almay

804
00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:59.289
research. I'm very proud to say that as of

805
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.949
this month. In fact, we have just published

806
00:49:00.958 --> 00:49:05.418
, I have just published an edited volume that summarizes

807
00:49:05.429 --> 00:49:08.500
30 years of research on all monkeys from Panama to

808
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.969
Argentina. This is a book published by Springer and

809
00:49:12.978 --> 00:49:15.550
it's available. The E book is free of charge

810
00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:17.579
and you can find all types of research data.

811
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:22.639
60 colleagues of mine, we have all put together

812
00:49:22.648 --> 00:49:24.139
uh spanning the research on our monkeys that has been

813
00:49:24.148 --> 00:49:29.000
done from Panama down to Argentina, including also research

814
00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.789
led by my colleagues in the US who have been

815
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.139
working with our monkeys for a very, very long

816
00:49:34.148 --> 00:49:37.079
time. So Al Monkey book by Springer is a

817
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:40.539
wonderful resource and it's available free of charge as an

818
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.820
E book. You can find all you need about

819
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:46.389
al monkeys there. Great. So I'm leaving some

820
00:49:46.398 --> 00:49:50.869
links to that in the description box of this interview

821
00:49:50.878 --> 00:49:52.228
